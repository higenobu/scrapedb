12/22/2021,"A man linked to a website which appeared to generate fake vaccination certificates in an email to his employer that was meant to contain proof he had received the jab, according to a ruling of the Fair Work Commission. The incident was revealed in a 20 December decision discontinuing his claim of having been unlawfully stood down, handed down by commission deputy president Richard Clancy.  The Victorian worker had taken his fight to the workplace tribunal after he stopped getting shifts with O&M Pty Ltd, a construction and maintenance company based in Gippsland, Victoria, earlier this year. But things went awry for the employee mid-conference as Clancy asked to see the proof he had sent to O&M, discovered the website, and declared his certificate may have been a fraud. “Fuck this, I’m not wasting any more time with you corrupt idiots,” the man said following a further exchange about a different issue, before abruptly ending the call, according to the decision. At the conference, the man argued he was unlawfully stood down, while O&M contended he was a casual employee and had not been stood down. Regardless, the company submitted, it had been unable to give the man work since 14 October as he had not provided proof of vaccination or a first dose booking, as was then required under Victorian health directions. The man said he had emailed proof of vaccination to O&M on 22 November. But, Clancy wrote, “The company held some concerns about the vaccination certificate produced by [the worker].” Why exactly became clear after the deputy president asked for a copy of the man’s email and saw it contained a hyperlink to a website with the phrase “theboyzareathepub” in its url. When the Guardian visited the URL it hosted what appeared to be a fake vaccination certificate generator. “Welcome to the Medicare vaccine pass generator,” the website, which is still active, reads. “Please input the data needed to make the pass here.” People are asked to input their name, date of birth and vaccination details and offered instructions on how to make the certificate appear as a smartphone app. “Make sure your dose dates add up,” the website reads. “Remember, 12 weeks between AZ and 5 (give or take 1) between Pfizer.” After viewing the website, Clancy told the conference it looked to him as though the man’s certificate “may be a fraud” that the worker had obtained by “fraudulent means”. A short time later, after the conversation had moved on, the man declared he would not be wasting any more time with the “corrupt idiots” on the call and hung up, according to the decision. The parting remark was taken as the man having discontinued his application, and Clancy closed the file. The deputy president suggested the authorities investigate the website. “If the vaccination certificate is a fraud and has been fraudulently obtained via an illegitimate hyperlink on the internet, this would be a matter of extremely serious public policy concern,” he wrote.",News/Australia news,Victorian worker linked to fake vaccination website in email meant to prove he had jab,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/22/victorian-worker-linked-to-fake-vaccination-website-in-email-meant-to-prove-he-had-jab

12/22/2021,"As Covid cases surge in Australia, attention is turning to how the health system is coping. To track the impact of the spread of the Omicron variant on hospitals, we have brought together the data on hospitalisations and new case numbers – both nationally and across states and territories for the last six months. Cases include those infected locally, overseas and where the source is unknown or under investigation.  Due to the difference in reporting times between jurisdictions it can be difficult to get a picture of the numbers, trends and impact on the healthcare system. But the seven-day average of new cases shows how cases are trending in each jurisdiction. Experts say there can be a lag of 10 to 14 days from when cases are reported and subsequent hospitalisations. Here, you can see hospitalisations and 7-day rolling Covid cases average in New South Wales: Here, you can see hospitalisations and the rolling case average in Victoria: In Queensland, the number of hospitalisations is higher as the state has at times required all active cases to be admitted in Covid wards. Here are the figures for South Australia: And here is the data for the ACT showing the difference between case numbers and hospitalisations: Notes: The data is released daily and this page will be updated throughout the day. As there are different reporting times for each jurisdiction, the most recent day’s data may not always be available for each state and territory. States and territories have differing criteria for when someone is admitted to hospital for a Covid infection. Some states such as Queensland have periodically isolated all active cases in hospitals, which can make comparisons across states difficult. The states also have differing thresholds for when their healthcare networks become overburdened.

12/22/2021,"This list is drawn from votes by Guardian TV writers: each votes for their top 20 shows, with points allocated for every placing, which are tallied to create this order.  (BBC Three) For some years now, Liam Williams has been blossoming into one of the sharpest observers of niche contemporary culture. In the second season of Ladhood, though, he continued to turn his gaze inward, unpicking moments from his adolescence that were critical to his development. It might just be his best work yet. What we said: By the end of series two, nothing has been resolved and nobody has grown as a person, just as the rules of sitcom demand. Liam doesn’t know what he is doing, but as a writer/performer, Williams really does. Read more. (BBC Two) Jamie Roberts’ film, covering January’s failed insurrectionist coup, had one huge advantage over most documentaries; almost everyone there was filming it. From the police officers’ bodycams to gurning selfie footage from the insurrectionists, Four Hours at the Capitol could take you right inside the terrible events of 6 January. At its most intense, when we watch a mob try to beat an officer to death, it stands as some of the most claustrophobic television ever broadcast. What we said: The underlying collective testimony furnished by Four Hours at the Capitol is that the age of Trump has not yet ended – and the true day of reckoning in the United States is still to come. Read more. (BBC Two) Now that his days as a heart-throb leading man are over, Colin Farrell can concentrate on what he does best: intriguing character work. The North Water saw him bulk up and head out to the Arctic, where he could terrify the crew of a whaling ship to impossible ends. His best performance in years. What we said: This is a well-executed adventure story to be watched by firelight, wrapped in a sweater as robust – if less blood-drenched – as the seamen’s own. Read more. (Channel 4/Amazon Prime Video) With less than 24 hours to go, Channel 4 struck a deal to show tennis sensation Emma Raducanu (who had just done her A-levels in Bromley) appearing in the US Open final. And a staggering 9 million of us tuned in to watch and weep as she and the brilliant Leylah Fernandez – herself only 19 – battled it out. A gripping night of television, and a glorious slice of the future. What we said: In a few small weeks she has improved as much as some do in years … and there is so much more to come. Read more. (BBC Two) Written by Dennis Kelly, directed by Stephen Daldry and starring James McAvoy and Sharon Horgan, this Covid two-hander certainly didn’t want for talent. A couple are, like the rest of the country, stuck inside together. And, like the rest of the country, they’ve started to hate each other. The real anger, though, is reserved for the government. As such, especially for those who lost a loved one in the first flush of Coronavirus, it was a staggeringly hard watch. What we said: “An absolute wonder.” Read more. (Netflix) The story of a century-old French gentleman thief might not have screamed “blockbuster”, but that’s what Lupin was. Updated to contemporary Paris, Lupin became a sensation this year, largely due to the juggernaut charisma of star Omar Sy. What we said: The winning combination of charismatic star and stage illusionist visuals in an iconic city setting bears comparison to the BBC’s London-set Sherlock. Where Lupin betters its English equivalent is in its effortlessly chic updating of the revered source material. Read more. (BBC One) Emily Mortimer’s retelling of Nancy Mitford’s novel could have fallen back on all the old Sunday-night TV chocolate-box tropes. Instead, Mortimer worked hard to boost both the joy and sadness of the source material. A clatteringly good watch that deserves to go down as a classic. What we said: The insistent intertwining of the pain with the laughter, instead of flattening the tale into a Wodehouse-with-women yarn, makes this adaptation feel like a classic in its own right. It is a treat for all. Mitfordians – please, do give it a chance. Read more. (HBO/Sky One) Not only did The Flight Attendant start with one of the best premises of the year – an alcoholic comes to with a murdered man in her bed – but it was inventively, breathlessly told, and held together by an all-time great performance from Kaley Cuoco. What we said: The premise is fun, the execution is slick and the action is fast and relentless (it only really pauses to let Cassie top up her blood-alcohol level or call her straight-arrow brother to assure him that she’s sober and will be home on time). Full of style and brio. Read more. (Netflix) Destined to be overshadowed by its fellow South Korean export Squid Game, Hellbound was far greater than the sum of its parts. A drama about demons who come to Earth and drag people to the underworld, Hellbound was much brainier – and more satirical – than you would imagine. And dark. So dark. What we said: Although the “here’s when you will die” hook is lifted straight from The Ring, tonally it has much more in common with The Leftovers and The Returned, shows that shone a light on the fragility of the human experience that reminded us that it doesn’t take much for everything to fall apart completely. Read more. (BBC Four) If you were worrying that Scandi noir was going to be outpaced by the dubious charms of the true crime fad, relax. This series about a real-life missing girl from the 1980s managed to combine the style and drama of Wallander with the queasy complicity of contemporary crime shows. What we said: It’s not the tortured psyches of the detective that are of most urgent interest here. Like series Mindhunter, which dramatised the founding of the FBI’s Behavioral Science Unit, this takes the familiar “case of the week” structure from police procedural thrillers and applies it to a serious-minded study of forensic psychology. Read more. (Netflix) It’s hard to know what was more impressive about Inside: the fact that Bo Burnham wrote, performed, directed and edited the whole thing by himself, the fact that it was simultaneously funny, inventive and gut-wrenchingly sad, or the fact that he was only 29 when he made it. Future generations will see Inside as the definitive document of the Covid lockdown. What we said: It is a comedy Gesamtkunstwerk, a journey to the nerve-centre of the quarantined entertainer’s mind, a son et lumière Robinson Crusoe musical for the age of not just social but digital isolation. It could be a breakdown – or it could be the pandemic’s wildest gift to comedy. Read more. (BBC Two) Ryan Murphy’s series about New York City’s African American and Latino LGBTQ+ and gender-nonconforming drag ball scene was already an important show. But in wrapping up the story, Pose became an out and out celebration of an under-represented demographic. It’ll be missed. What we said: Its version of revolution always included bettering the bleak truth through sheer force of imagination. And so, this show has offered up the happy ending that real life so cruelly denies. Read more. (Amazon Prime Video) Just when it looked as if he had ossified into an obnoxious pub bore, Jeremy Clarkson suddenly went and became charming. In Clarkson’s Farm, we saw him trying his hardest to make profit from his land, aided by employees who don’t care a jot for his celebrity. If the success of this first series doesn’t go to his head, Clarkson’s Farm will be a highly successful reinvention. What we said: To watch Clarkson’s Farm is to watch a man realise that the hobby he seemingly picked up for a lark is exhausting and all-consuming and increasingly unlikely to bring any real rewards. The show, like the job, has all the hallmarks of a labour of love. Read more. (BBC Two) A five-part retelling of the last time Labour got anywhere even close to power, Blair and Brown was the document New Labour deserved. And, just maybe, that British voters deserved as well. What we said: It is an inside job, with Labour veterans as unreliable narrators. Brown’s speechwriter Douglas Alexander even says: “They were literally the Lennon and McCartney of British politics.” Rubbish. They were more like Wham!, with no George Michael and two Andrew Ridgeleys. Read more. (BBC Two) The US had The Last Dance, an all-out spectacular retracing a vital moment in time for a figure who once arguably counted as the biggest name in all of sport. In the UK, we got a documentary about snooker. The amazing thing, though, was that this might have actually been better. What we said: You cannot fail to be captivated by archive footage of Jimmy White spinning a ball around a table before, suddenly, decades later, the same man is in a hotel room telling you exactly how much of his winnings he spent on crack. Read more. (BBC Two) By its third series, you pretty much know where a sitcom will go. That’s true of Motherland, which barely attempted to deviate from its formula of middle-class mums being horrible to each other. But why bother when the blueprint is so good? What we said: Motherland is at its best when it is skewering what it knows: the snobbery, hypocrisy and narcissism of a specific strain of white, middle-class London, plus the hellscape of the school gate. And when it is at its best, it is glorious. Read more. (BBC One) The best all-round British sitcom in years, Ghosts’ third series mined slightly more heartfelt territory than before. Not only were the phantoms fleshed out more fully, but Charlotte Ritchie’s Alison found herself yearning for a family that couldn’t quite manifest itself. As beautiful as it was funny. What we said: I’m quite pleased the old guff survived. But my worry is that Ghosts will become ruined by the exclusivity of its admission policy. Somebody, preferably somebody likable and interesting, needs to die to save Ghosts. But who? Read more. (Sky Comedy) Issa Rae’s comedy about a group of black LA girlfriends living, loving and frequently falling flat on their faces while doing both has spent five seasons deftly combining laugh-out-loud hilarity (who could forget Kelli getting tasered?) with real poignancy. Its ongoing final series has given fans a steady stream of zingers, contrasting the reality that a happy ever after for Issa, Molly, Lawrence and co is far from guaranteed. What we said: The fifth and final season of this comedy about a group of black millennial girlfriends is all about giving its fans what they want. Namely, will-they-won’t-they drama, existential crises and pitch-perfect Kelli-isms. Despite its angst, it remains resolutely fun. Read more. (BBC One) Greg Davies adapted and starred in this adaptation of the German series Der Tatortreiniger, about a man tasked with removing crime scene evidence from the homes of several guest stars. It might not be the most original premise, but when The Cleaner worked, it really worked. What we said: The Cleaner is a curious mix, attempting to balance slapstick moments, such as the brutal kicking of a pie, with pathos-laden observations about ambition and freedom. Sometimes, it works wonderfully. Read more. (ITV) A dusty old survivor like this ITV detective show always runs the risk of becoming set in its ways. Not so with Unforgotten, which this year said goodbye to its star Nicola Walker. It’s bittersweet: she was perfect in this role, but now she’s freed up to become an Olivia Colman-style megastar. What we said: Over the years, Unforgotten has turned into one of the finest shows on British television. By the time it reached its fourth series, which attracted more viewers than ever before – thanks to its growing reputation as a sure bet – it was as lean as an elite athlete. Read more. (Netflix) Once Aziz Ansari was sucked into #MeToo’s bonfire of reputations, it seemed unlikely that he would ever make more Master of None. When he did, staying behind the camera for a new series subtitled Moments in Love, it was with a completely new focus. This run concentrated on Lena Waithe’s character Denise, and was composed of still, quiet episodes that paid off stunningly. What we said: For conflicted comedy fans the solution might be to stop worrying and start watching. These 192 minutes speak more directly to the shifting status of women on screen than any public statement could. Read more. (BBC Scotland/iPlayer) The first series of Neil Forsyth’s crime thriller was a word-of-mouth hit, largely thanks to Mark Bonnar’s psychotic growl of a performance. This year’s second series lost a little of its pace, but was still as compelling as ever. Let’s all cross our fingers for a third series. What we said: Guilt is a guilty pleasure, and I won’t be missing a second of it. Read more. (Channel 4) Another one-off Covid drama, Help starred Jodie Comer and Stephen Graham as a care home worker and resident respectively. Jack Thorne’s script surged with rage at the indifference with which the care sector was left to rot as the first wave of the pandemic rolled in. There’s plenty of warmth, but you’re never allowed to forget who the villains are. What we said: Comer and Graham remain faultless to the end, and the first hour is a fine addition to the wealth of pandemic testimonies that can and must be entered into the record in any way they can be, from television drama to heart-wall monuments to official enquiries. Read more. (Disney+) Ambient Beatles? Slow Beatles? Peter Jackson’s Fab Four epic leaned into the sheer quantity of extraordinary footage at its creator’s disposal, capturing a band on the verge of dissolution but still full of heart and creative inspiration. Watching the song Get Back emerge, almost fully formed, from Paul McCartney’s fevered imagination was just one of numerous jaw-dropping moments. What we said: There are fantastic moments. Lennon and McCartney’s eyes locking as they harmonise on Two of Us; Lennon’s delighted cry of “Yoko!” as McCartney’s adopted daughter starts screaming into a microphone; and especially McCartney, casting around for a new song, idly strumming his bass and singing nonsense words, gradually settling into a rhythm and melody that turns into Get Back. It is hard not to boggle. Read more. (Disney+) Taika Waititi and Sterlin Harjo’s comedy drama about bored youths trying to make it out of Oklahoma would have been brilliant in any case. But what elevated it is its cast (and near-uniform crew) of Indigenous North Americans. There’s a cultural specificity here that felt not only authentic, but authentically funny and sweet, like meeting a daft, lovable new circle of friends. What we said: Reservation Dogs is able to lay waste stylishly to centuries of myth and misrepresentation due to one simple, crucial, innovation: almost everyone involved in the production is a Native American, offering a perspective which never panders to the often-fetishising gaze of outsiders. Read more. (Disney+) A new show starring Steve Martin and Martin Short didn’t have to try very hard; a splash of the old charm and viewers would have fallen in line regardless. The genius of Only Murders in the Building, though, was how deftly it glued its comic shtick to a rigorously tight murder mystery. Much, much better than it had any right to be. What we said: The investigation pings around with comic incompetency, from suspecting Sting (playing himself), to a bit involving a dead cat. The main event remains the unlikelihood of watching two comedy titans batting around with Selena Gomez – an enjoyable enough pairing, though it never quite transcends the clear beats of the scripts. Read more. (Netflix) Call My Agent!’s fourth season saw a change of personnel, with showrunner par excellence Fanny Herrero moving on to pastures new. With her departure came a noticeable drop in quality, but let’s be clear. A Herrero-less Call My Agent! is still Call My Agent! It was stylish, funny and star-studded, and still ran circles around most other shows. This year’s season was publicised as its last, but calm down – a fifth season and a movie are now on their way. What we said: While the much-maligned Emily in Paris offered a kind of escapism for those hankering but unable to go to the city of lights and love, Call My Agent! gives you a far more authentic immersion into French culture. Read more. (BBC One) How to create one of the most nail-biting televisual experiences of the year? Take a tense, twisty procedural plot, get Suranne Jones to fire on all cylinders as a trauma-racked action hero badass, then cram her into a ready-made environment for a claustrophobic whodunnit: a nuclear sub. What we said: Throughout, Vigil has been a rich and sometimes sickly meal. Just one of its anxiety-inducing scenarios would be enough for most dramas, but this had international conflict, political intrigue, claustrophobic horror, psychological trauma, murder, cops, romance and nerve agents thrown in and set to various clock-ticking countdowns. Read more. (BBC Two) By now you could be forgiven for taking Inside No 9 for granted. But this year, Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton managed to find even greater heights. There was a Brexit episode, an episode about the uneasy relationship between fans and creators, an episode where Sian Clifford played against type twice at once. The invention here continues to be phenomenal. What we said: As writers, actors and occasionally directors, the pair have shown that they can switch from bleak domestic drama to Shakespearean light comedy to full-on horror without dropping a stitch. Read more. (Netflix) A devastating and compelling portrait of life on the poverty line in the US, starring Rylea Nevaeh Whittet, the cutest child actor in years, as Maddy, Margaret Qualley as Alex, a woman willing to do anything for her family – and her real-life mother Andie MacDowell (the strongest she’s ever been) playing her gullible, free-spirited artist mum Paula. Right up there with Squid Game for word-of-mouth hit of the year. What we said: It dramatises the precariousness of existence without a fixed abode and conjures a world rarely seen in real life or on screen. It is also good at showing the insidious forms and effects of emotional abuse without insisting that Alex be an ever-broken victim. Read more. (BBC iPlayer) Adam Curtis polarises audiences like few other documentarians. For some, he is television’s ultimate truth teller. For others, he’s an impenetrable conspiracy theorist. If you’re in the first group, Can’t Get You Out of My Head was an absolutely breathless delight. What we said: It is vanishingly rare to be confronted by work so dense, so widely searching and ambitious in scope, so intelligent and respectful of the audience’s intelligence, too. Read more. (BBC One) Now overshadowed by its finale, dismissed as anticlimactic by viewers and aggressively defended at length by Jed Mercurio, Line of Duty’s sixth series was just as tight and knotty as ever. And it absolutely pummelled everything else on television to pieces. Sixteen million people watched its final episode in May. In 2021, that’s incredible. What we said: At the risk of sounding like a mere embittered fan shouting at Johnny-come-latelies … man, you should have seen it back in the days when it was good. Read more. (BBC Three/iPlayer) Daisy Haggard and Laura Solon’s Hythe-set comedy-drama returned in just as good shape as it left us: a sad, strange tale about the reputations we cannot shake. Exquisitely observed, sensitively performed and gorgeous to look at. Who could ask for more? What we said: The show has lost none of its delicacy or nuance, nor have its makers disturbed its heart and soul – in fact, they have only added to it. Quality pum-pum all round. Read more. (Channel 4) Like Back to Life, the second series of Aisling Bea’s This Way Up improved on its first. This time, as well as focusing on the recovery of Bea’s character Aine, the show was also bold enough to tackle Covid as a storyline. The fact that it was almost entirely alone in making the subject work with this little distance makes it doubly worthy of praise. What we said: The best thing of all about This Way Up is that we don’t know what is going to happen next. Bea’s is such a nuanced, delicate portrait of mental health that Aine is neither a one-note self-sabotager, or manic, or depressive. She is a real person and, as such, she could go anywhere or do anything depending on when and if her circumstances change. Read more. (Disney+) The Marvel Cinematic Universe’s first real extension into television could have gone horribly wrong – and, indeed, the shows that came afterwards prove that much is still to be mastered in that area – but WandaVision was a delight from start to finish. By basing each episode on a sitcom from a different era (for reasons that do make sense at the end, honest), this was Marvel reassuring us that it reveres television as much as it does comics and film. The most unexpected love letter of the year. What we said: It’s all deliciously, confidently, stylishly done. The parodies are fantastic fun, the jokes are great, the performances are wonderful, and it has the glorious air of something shaped by people who know exactly what they’re doing, where they want to go and how they’re going to get there. Read more. (Channel 4) A sitcom about an all-female, all-Muslim punk band, We Are Lady Parts is the sort of show a cynic might write off as tokenistic. Until they actually watched it, that is, because Nida Manzoor’s comedy was exactly that; a silly, giddy half hour that was actually designed to make people laugh. The band’s song names – Voldemort Under My Headscarf, Bashir With the Good Beard – were just a glorious bonus. What we said: We Are Lady Parts is an assured mix of second-generation cultural confusion and millennial feminism, one part Chewing Gum to two parts Wayne’s World. Read more. (Apple TV+) What else is there to say about Ted Lasso? Its achievements are already numerous – it’s funny, warm-hearted, wildly celebrated and it made people actually want to watch Apple TV+ – and yet you sense that more is to come. The first season was an unexpectedly sweet fish out of water comedy, the second dug a little deeper into the compulsions of its characters. What on Earth will a third do? Initiate world peace? What we said: The broadening and deepening must have felt like a risk to everyone involved in a show predicated on bringing light comic relief to viewers, and which then became frankly essential to their mental wellbeing. But it’s paid off. They shot and they’ve scored. Read more. (Amazon Prime Video ) Director Barry Jenkins’ harrowing, bravura adaptation of Colson Whitehead’s award-winning novel about slavery, which turned the networks that smuggled enslaved people to safety in the north into a literal train network with stations hidden in the homes of sympathetic white folks. Scene for scene, this was some of the most visually staggering television in years – and a rare show that was impossible to binge watch. What we said: An extraordinary adaptation – hallucinatory, magical, allegorical and yet permanently in the pursuit of historical and eternal truths, the resurrection of lost perspectives and the uplifting of unheard voices. Watch it, but slowly, one complex, virtuosic, heartbreaking episode at a time. Read more. (BBC One) Following his Small Axe anthology series last year, Steve McQueen returned with a documentary that dug much deeper into a subject that underpinned many episodes. Uprising told the story of the 1981 New Cross fire, carefully setting it in political context, then unleashing the horror of a crime that took 13 Black lives, then refusing to back down from its consequences. Unbelievably powerful. What we said: To watch this knowing the horrors to come is almost unbearable, but it has a clear-headed determination to show the real, full, human lives of the people who died. Read more. (Channel 4) In its third series, Jamie Demetriou’s sitcom remained as riotously silly as ever – witness the tender song about eggs Stath sings to his newborn child – while mining the characters for a deeper vulnerability. There were moments of unbearable sweetness nestled among the idiocy this year, and the thought of a life with no more Stath is almost too much to take. What we said: Stath is not a show designed to assess the state of the nation, or dive deep into a dysfunctional psyche, but to make people laugh: the clothes are funny, the situations are funny, the speech patterns are funny, the relationships are funny. Read more. (Netflix) In its second outing, Tim Robinson’s absurd comedy sketch show scaled new heights of surreal, laugh-out-loud greatness. Its meme-friendly skits somehow managed to cram subplots into scenes shorter than most ad breaks, often managing to draw belly-laughs through cleverly wrong-footing the viewer. At its best, it felt like it was reinventing what a sketch show should be in the internet era – and it was often at its best. What we said: In its second season Robinson and his co-stars pulled at the threads of their gags almost to the point of unravelling the very sense of them – and it left viewers astounded at their capacity to create hilarity from increasingly outrageous situations. Read more. (BBC One) In New Zealand comic Rose Matafeo’s lovable romcom, her character Jessie is having a strange old time living in London, with a titchy flat, tedious jobs – and the fact that she can’t stop bumping into a movie star named Tom Kapoor (Nikesh Patel) that she had a one night stand with. What we said: It was basically the 2021 version of Notting Hill, and – gladly – like the 90s, all the meet-cutes happened in real life rather than in the ninth circle of dating app hell. At just over 20 minutes an episode, it was a sweet, gentle, moreish confection that could have easily stretched to more than its six episodes. Read more. (BBC Two) Sophie Willan’s autobiographical show about the childhood she describes as being “the baby in Trainspotting, if she’d lived” won a comedy Bafta for the pilot alone. So this six-episode series, which saw her move from a job in a sandwich shop to becoming a sex worker and finally joining a theatre troupe, was an absolute riotous delight. What we said: Serious ground is covered – observations on the welfare system, the reality of living with addiction – and Alma’s attempt to address her childhood will leave a tear in your eye. But, throughout, the show is an invitation to acknowledge life’s lemons and laugh in the face of them. One of the most joyous comedies of the year. Read more. (BBC One) Jimmy McGovern’s hard, horrifying look at prison life was seen largely through the eyes of former teacher Mark Cobden (Sean Bean), who was serving his first stretch. Bean’s performance was a masterclass in understatement, communicated mainly through silence and shuffles on the wing – and it made for even more devastating television. What we said: McGovern is known for polemics but the brilliance of Time is that it manages to show, not tell. There is very little grandstanding here – we are simply presented with the grim realities of our dysfunctional penal system and asked, implicitly, how we would cope. Read more. (Netflix) Mae Martin’s exquisite romcom returned, this time fuelled not by love but by trauma, as Mae returned to Canada to confront her past and her gender identity. Though that makes it sound heavy, Feel Good is so glorious that it not only managed to make it work, but also outdo its first run. What we said: Series two dug deeper than the first. It was funnier, darker and more prescient. Each of its six episodes are mini-masterpieces – as taut, atmospheric and perfectly paced as short stories. The Channel 4 executives who unfathomably chose not to pick Feel Good up must be kicking themselves. Read more. (Netflix) The grim, grisly South Korean drama became a global word-of-mouth smash in a matter of days. We saw 456 debt-riddled contestants compete in a horrific gameshow whose winner goes home with 4.6bn won (£28m), and losers get killed on the spot. What we said: This was a drama that encouraged us to follow the logic of capitalism to its extreme by treating everything, including fellow humans, as commodities. Would you, in extremis, resemble the relatable dad – player 456, Seong Gi-hun – or self-serving venal gangster – player 067, Kang Sae-byeok? Read more. (HBO/Sky Atlantic) For half a season, the third outing of this captivating drama about a dysfunctional media dynasty took things slowly. Then it went supernova, finding a gear that, even by the show’s own impossible standards, it had never found before. It’s not overstating it to say that this was the show’s best ever run of episodes. What we said: All the storylines that had been humming away in the background snapped to attention, and the stakes are colossal. Professionally, everything is on fire. Personally, the ground is littered with bodies. If the first six episodes were about sharks circling the water, this is where we get to see them rip each other apart. Read more. (HBO/Sky Atlantic) So gripping was this twisty, compelling detective drama that for two months of 2021, Mare-mania took hold. Who killed Erin? Would anyone pay for her poor baby’s ear surgery? And was it OK to use the term Katenaissance to describe Kate Winslet’s finest ever performance? Mare of Easttown could easily have fallen into familiar tortured-cop-investigates-dead-teen territory. Instead, the depth and detail of every character arc and subplot was incredible, with even seemingly minor moments delivering some of the most horrifying TV scenes ever. By the end, as each character’s full tragedy was laid bare, it was a miracle anyone was still standing. What we said: This was a whodunnit that blindsided the viewer from start to finish – and had so much more besides. It was thrilling: tense and edge-of-the-seat stuff, excellently paced with plenty of twists and cliffhangers. Read more. (HBO/Sky Atlantic) Was it a murder mystery? A tragicomedy? A social satire on the way America contorts itself around the requirements of late western capitalism? Mike White’s immaculate six-part creation was all of these and more, serving up a hilarious drama, brought joyously to life by a brilliant ensemble cast and hooky story, kept from slipping into soapiness by delicate dialogue and a firm hand on the narrative reins. At times, it was so good, it felt rather like you’d been treated to a luxury holiday yourself. What we said: A hysterically funny drama that folded in every kind of comic moment, from alpha mom Nicole’s fretting over lumpen, screen-addicted scion Quinn (“so alienated”) because there’s never been a harder time to be a straight, white male, to Rachel’s giddily awful mother-in-law, to the simple joy of Armond’s scatological revenge in the finale. Read more. (Channel 4) A five-part drama about the arrival of Aids in Britain and the devastation it wrought was always going to be gut-wrenching viewing. But it was the furious, beautiful joy of the show that took you by surprise, with Russell T Davies serving up a viewing experience that was funny and full of life in a way that was – strange though it sounds to say – genuinely enjoyable to watch. Not only did it make you care deeply about its characters’ lives, it did so with a sense of humour that made the darkest moments all the more heart-rending. What we said: This was television full of energy and vitality. It’s a Sin was deeply upsetting, as it was supposed to be, and Davies made us love these characters, flaws and all. I cried at the end of the first episode, knowing what was going to happen, and I wept as it did happen, again and again.

12/22/2021,"It will be toasts and talk of bonuses at ITV this Christmas as management savours a year to remember: a startling recovery has brought the broadcaster more advertising income than at any time in its 66-year history, TV production revenues are back above pre-pandemic levels and a belated foray into streaming is starting to pay off. And yet as Carolyn McCall enters her fourth year as chief executive she will be wondering why investors – and potential buyers – still do not view the company as a rejuvenated, digital-age crown jewel of British broadcasting.  When McCall left easyJet to take the reins from Adam Crozier, now installed as BT’s new chairman as the telecoms giant becomes a takeover target for billionaire investor Patrick Drahi, investors valued ITV at £7.25bn. The broadcaster’s market capitalisation has remained stubbornly well below that level ever since, with a current valuation at £4.3bn. Despite that reduced price and the rush of foreign private equity firms snapping up UK firms this year, there is no sign of any takeover suitor as yet. “The problem is that fairly or unfairly it is perceived as an ex-growth business,” said one City source. “From time to time it is talked about as a target, everyone knows it’s there, but no one has taken it out. The market decided some time ago that companies that are dependent on TV advertising were not going to be worth much again. The world’s stock markets have stuck with that credo, ascribing value to companies seen as in the digital space.” The pandemic recovery has ITV’s ad business firing on all cylinders. Its portfolio of channels accounts for about 40% of the UK’s £3.7bn traditional TV ad market, with more good news expected next year with sectors including travel, cars and high street retail forecast to return along with the advertising gold of the next football World Cup. McCall’s focus is to get investors to reassess ITV beyond the narrow focus on TV advertising – 60% of the broadcaster’s total revenues come from non-advertising sources – by beating the drum for its digital and media content businesses. Earlier this month, she unveiled a five-year plan for ITV Studios – which makes in-house shows such as Coronation Street, I’m a Celebrity … and Love Island, as well as third-party productions such as Line of Duty for the BBC and Countdown for Channel 4 – with a firm eye on exploiting the surge in demand for expensive, prestige TV shows from streaming platforms such as Netflix. She unveiled the eye-catching goal of increasing the proportion of ITV Studios’ total revenues accounted for by commissions from streaming companies to a quarter, up from 14% this year, and doubling the number of hours of high-end scripted TV shows to 400. “We have grown our revenues from streamers as we have tilted our business towards the strong growth in demand from that part of the market,” said Julian Bellamy, managing director of ITV Studios, at a presentation for analysts and investors. The third element of McCall’s vision is to build a convincing domestic streaming business in ITV Hub, which also offers an ad-free, paid-for tier in the form of ITV Hub+, and internationally through its BritBox joint venture with the BBC. Last month, McCall hailed the progress at ITV Hub, calling it an “increasingly scaled digital business”, with monthly active users hitting 9.6 million and online viewing climbing by almost 40% year-on-year to 494m hours in the first nine months of 2021. While ITV Hub is a success story among traditional broadcasters – analysts at Ampere estimate it makes more in ad revenue than similar services run by all other major commercial broadcast groups in western Europe combined – it remains small in a world dominated by digital beasts such as Netflix, Disney and Amazon. Its reach is also dwarfed by its biggest British rival, the ad-free iPlayer, which is currently on track to break 6bn streams in a year for the first time. Just 4% of the 12bn total hours of video from all sources watched by ITV viewers in the first nine months of the year was on ITV Hub, which as it grows risks cannibalising the broadcaster’s far more profitable traditional TV business. “The digital story is anaemic,” says one City source. “They didn’t prioritise it before. They came at it late. ITV Hub and BritBox will become successful, but on a very small scale, not significant enough to re-rate the business.” Business fundamentals aside there is, of course, a significant impediment to any potential takeover in the form of John Malone’s Liberty Global (LG), ITV’s largest shareholder. LG, which earlier this year merged Virgin Media with mobile firm 02, has held a 9.9% stake in ITV for the last six years. “They have always been a deterrent, a very serious media company that no one wants to piss off,” says Claire Enders, of Enders Analysis. “They aren’t your average garden variety deterrent, they are a big monster deterrent.” While ITV may not be at the top of a private equity or trade buyer shopping list, the broadcaster has an ambitious, TV landscape-changing potential target of its own: Channel 4. ITV has quietly been positioning itself as the ideal solution for the government’s potential privatisation plans – a British consolidator giving both broadcasters a boost in scale – although the resulting 60%-plus share of the UK TV ad market would have advertisers and rivals up in arms and the competition regulator on high alert. There is change planned at the top next year, with Peter Bazalgette expected to step down after six years as ITV’s chair, and nine on its board, when his term expires in May. With Rona Fairhead, the former chair of the BBC Trust, tipped as a contender to replace him and become the first woman in the role, ITV’s mission to become a “loved” stock will continue. “It is not viewed as a badly run business, it is efficiently and well run,” said Enders. “Every part of their business is doing extraordinarily well at this time. A couple of exceptional years and people will see the core of the business is not in this secular decline. ITV is not getting the credit it should, but it will do.”",News/Business,ITV can toast a bumper year – yet investors remain reluctant,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/22/itv-can-toast-a-bumper-year-yet-investors-remain-reluctant
12/22/2021,"Boris Johnson rose to the top by getting people to like him. His problems are the result of them subsequently getting to know him. There is no mask that has slipped, just a change in the light that gives a dark edge to the same features. It is often this way with leaders on the way down. The trait people dislike is the origin of previous appeal inverted. The stolidity that once recommended Theresa May and Gordon Brown turned robotic. The charm of Tony Blair and David Cameron went from smooth to slippery.  With the current prime minister that trait is indifference to difficulty – meeting adversity with good cheer; solving problems by declaring them non-existent; clearing practical obstacles by leaps of the imagination. The ethos is expressed in Johnson’s subversion of a famous proverb: “My policy on cake is pro having it and pro eating it.” It has been a catchphrase of his for years, but it was the dilemmas posed by Brexit that turned it into a doctrine – cakeism. In the cakeist view, Britain could retain the benefits of EU membership without any obligation to European law. It meant leaving a trading bloc without loss of trade. It meant having different customs regimes for Great Britain and Northern Ireland without erecting a politically toxic customs border between them. “I want you to see this as a cakeist treaty,” Johnson said of the post-Brexit trade deal he signed in December 2020. A year later: there is no cake, Conservative MPs are hungry, and voters are abandoning the bakery. Europe is not the proximate cause of that discontent, but cakeism has evolved into a creed for the denial of all the choices that make governing difficult. It explains a “levelling up” agenda and a “green industrial revolution” that presuppose massive increases in public investment without offending Tory ambitions for a smaller state. It is the vain hope of limiting the spread of Covid infections without imposing restraints on individual freedoms. A cakeist pandemic strategy urges people to avoid mixing in crowds, without instructing them to stay away from shops and bars. It results in a cabinet meeting to debate new restrictions that concludes, after two hours, with a decision not to decide. It is the prime minister saying he “will not hesitate to act” as long as that action can wait until after Christmas. When Johnson was at the height of his powers he would prevaricate at leisure, comfortable in two minds or more, happy to make eager courtiers compete for his ear and hang on his decision. When the Covid crisis first struck, he used delay as a management technique, letting time and events winnow the options while ramping the urgency, until the lockdown decisions made themselves. Now, brought low by scandal and besieged by aspiring successors, inaction is the course imposed by an absence of authority over his party. Those are the different stages of cakeism, from insouciance to paralysis, via denial. At its core sits monumental arrogance – a feeling of superiority to forces that constrain the inferior class of politician who submits to history instead of mastering it. From that vanity it follows that rules are for the little people. Helmsmen of history are allowed to unwind over cheese and wine on the Downing Street terrace, even while the families of Covid victims hold funerals by Zoom. The prime minister might not have issued an explicit licence to flout lockdown rules in government, but none was needed. He radiates the entitlement to self-gratification and the pomposity that justifies it as fair recompense for a hard day’s service to the nation. It is a particular type of corruption, common to revolutionary regimes that have lost ideological momentum. It is the decadent stage that comes when the party elite has understood that the utopia they promised is unattainable, but is enjoying the trappings of power too much to break the bad news to the people in whose name they seized power. The pandemic has dominated Johnson’s time in office, but Brexit gave him his mandate. It was the cause that won him an election but, more important for his style of government, that victory was understood by Eurosceptic hardliners as an expression of the true will of the people. It was the refutation of the naysaying, cosmopolitan remainer elites, fussy civil servants, busybody bureaucrats, bean-counting trade experts and meddling judges who claimed that Johnson could not have his cake and eat it. To that roster of shame can now be added “unelected public health spokesperson”, which is the term one Tory MP used to denounce Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, for daring to sound downbeat about the spread of Omicron in the runup to Christmas. That is where cakeism tends – the suspicion that science itself is part of an elite conspiracy against liberty. That is not Johnson’s view, but he has lost control of the doctrine he pioneered. Having acquired the taste for unlimited cake, the Conservative party will not easily be put back on a calorie-controlled policy diet. Cakeism is not a formula that works in government because, in reality, the cake has to be rationed and people notice. They notice, too, when the prime minister and his friends help themselves to the fattest slice, while urging the public to abstain out of civic duty. They see how the man who treats everything as a joke is also laughing at the people who elected him. That is when the light changes, the smile darkens into a sneer, the populist loses his people, the polarities of his magnetism are flipped, and the force that was once attraction turns repulsive.

12/22/2021,"It was once home to literary and artistic greats including Oscar Wilde, but now Tite Street in west London has a new claim to fame after Halifax named it the most expensive street in England and Wales, with an average house price of £28.9m. The mortgage lender said the top 10 priciest streets in 2021 were all in the capital, mainly in Westminster or the borough of Kensington and Chelsea, where Tite Street is situated.  However, its £28.9m average property price is 5% lower than the £30.5m recorded for the most expensive street a year ago – Avenue Road in London’s St John’s Wood. Halifax added that desirable roads outside the capital had seen prices increase at a faster rate. London has typically not experienced the same property boom as other regions this year, as pandemic-fuelled desires for a new lifestyle led many to quit big cities for homes elsewhere with more space and bigger gardens. The average price of a home on one of the 10 most expensive streets in the north of England and the West Midlands increased by 11% in a year, making them the two best-performing regions, said the Halifax. In the north-west, prices have typically increased by 5%, followed by the East Midlands at 4%. London, by contrast, experienced just a 1% rise. Tite Street, lined with red brick mansion blocks and set between the banks of the River Thames to the south and Kings Road to the north, has risen from No 2 on the list last year to the top spot. However, you do not need to spend close to £30m to own a slice of this prime real estate: a two-bedroom flat in the street is currently for sale and has been reduced to £1.65m, according to property website Rightmove. Wilde was the street’s most famous resident, reaching the height of his fame while living at No 34, where he wrote The Picture of Dorian Gray and The Importance of Being Earnest. Other notable residents included the American artists James McNeill Whistler and John Singer Sargent. On 27 November 1974, the IRA carried out two bomb attacks in Tite Street. A small bomb exploded in a post box and was followed by a larger one that went off behind a hedge, injuring 20, including six police officers and two ambulance workers. Twenty years later, Diana, Princess of Wales posed for a portrait at No 33. Last week, Halifax forecast that the boom in UK house prices was likely to end next year as household finances become increasingly stretched. Rightmove said earlier this month that the UK’s housing market was likely to return to more normal levels of activity in 2022 but would still be “busy”. Halifax said its latest data was based on transactions between January 2016 and September 2021 recorded on the Land Registry database and compiled from more than 1.78m postcodes. Only locations where there have been at least two transactions over the period are included. Greater London – Tite Street, Chelsea: average price of a home £28,902,000 South-east England – South Ridge, Weybridge, Surrey: £7,125,000 North-west England – Barrow Lane, Hale, Altrincham, Greater Manchester: £3,706,000 East Anglia – Chaucer Road, Cambridge: £3,610,000 South-west England – Pearce Avenue, Poole, Dorset: £3,478,000 East Midlands – Benscliffe Road, Newtown Linford, Leicester: £3,288,000 West Midlands – Carpenter Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham: £3,088,000 North of England – Old Hall Road, Windermere, Cumbria: £2,508,000 Wales – Benar Headland, Pwllheli, Gwynedd: £2,152,000 Yorkshire and the Humber – Fulwith Mill Lane, Harrogate, North Yorkshire: £1,797,000 Source: Halifax",Lifestyle/Money,Oscar Wilde’s former street named the most expensive in England,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/dec/22/oscar-wildes-former-street-named-the-most-expensive-in-england
12/22/2021,"The ruddy duck, Oxyura jamaicensis, should have been exterminated by now in the UK, hunted down and shot at a cost of roughly £3,000 a bird. If you see one you are supposed to report its position so it too can be eliminated. Peak numbers 20 years ago were 6,000 birds – that was down to 26 in 2018 and now there may be as few as 10 to 15.  This is part of a Europe-wide programme aimed at preventing the enthusiastic males impregnating the closely related but endangered white-headed duck, Oxyura leucocephala, of southern Spain. That species was down to 22 birds in 1977 but thanks to careful conservation now numbers more than 2,500. The ruddy duck was brought to Slimbridge sanctuary in Gloucestershire in the 1940s from North America and thrived, with numbers growing steadily across Europe until the danger to white-headed ducks became apparent. In a rare spirit of European cooperation every colonised country agreed to a cull, aiming at total elimination. The British effort alone has cost £3.3m, mostly to hire the marksmen. It has been a controversial programme, with many nature lovers appalled at the idea of shooting sitting ducks on their nests. Some bird spotters have therefore been reluctant to report sightings, so there may still be some survivors.",News/Environment,Specieswatch: 10 to 15 ruddy ducks left in UK after Europe-wide cull,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/22/specieswatch-10-to-15-ruddy-ducks-left-in-uk-after-europe-wide-cull
12/22/2021,"Geneva in March 1986 was cold. I had travelled overnight on an extremely long train journey from London to Switzerland. I and several other women heading for a huge lesbian feminist conference had failed to find affordable flights and instead had bought train tickets with vouchers collected from very large boxes of Persil washing powder. The journey was hellish. There was no heating on any of the trains and we only had enough booze for the odd warming sip from a hip flask. I was wearing every pair of socks I had packed and would run up and down the carriages every half-hour trying to get my circulation moving.  I had hoped conditions would improve once we arrived, but the conference was held in a university building, and to say it was basic is an understatement. Being a lesbian in the 1980s was no walk in the park, and we were not considered worthy of elevated heating bills. Some of the 800 delegates had come from warmer climes in South America, Asia and Australia, as well as parts of Europe and North America. Everyone was cold, even the women I met from Winnipeg, known for its freezing winters. Our accommodation was a bus ride away, beneath the ground in nuclear bunkers. It was obvious that I was not going to get warm any time soon. We were issued bunk beds with thin blankets, the showers ran cold to tepid, and the food was mainly the feminist staples of pasta salad and hummus. And then I met charismatic Carla (not her real name), an anarchist from New York. Carla was different from my usual crowd of hardline feminists. Whereas we would picket porn cinemas to protest against sexual exploitation, Carla’s crowd called for class war, believed all work was exploitation and dressed like goths. But our mutual attraction was enough to gloss over differences in politics. Over steaming cups of herb tea laced with cheap brandy we talked late into the night, pausing to listen to the women from the Greenham Common peace camp singing campfire songs (no doubt in part to invoke the image of crackling logs and flames), about property being theft, lesbian vampire films and whether feminists should be vegetarian (Carla said “yes” because men see women as meat, and learn to do so from butchering animals, but I said “no” because all I could think of was eating a hot bowl of lamb stew to warm me up). As we snuggled up, I smelt patchouli oil and roll-ups. I would love to be able to say that “that night [we] were not divided”, as Radclyffe Hall wrote in her infamous lesbian novel, The Well of Loneliness, but I am afraid that not only did the bunk beds mean there was no privacy, but they were so small a leprechaun would struggle to fit in one. The Greenham women, appalled at being accommodated in a nuclear bunker, constructed wigwams in which they congregated during the conference sessions, and despite the awful caterwauling of anti-war songs, I crawled in with them to keep warm. As evenings drew in, and the cans of cider appeared, the lesbian drumming group started bashing out rhythms that prompted many of the women to dance like crazy, doubtless to keep the blood flowing. During these activities, Carla and I would be in a passionate clinch somewhere, our collective breath visible as though we were puffing on fat cigars. There was much to love about the conference and, as I travelled home, fantasising about a hot bath and a thick duvet, I allowed my mind to wander, imagining meeting Carla in a little more comfort back in London. But, silly me, Carla was an anarchist and therefore lived in an unheated, grotty squat in Brixton. To make matters worse, the gas had been cut off, so there were no cups of hot chocolate, and we couldn’t afford brandy. Our romance was short-lived, and I did wonder, for some time afterwards, whether it would have been different had we met in the summer months. I somehow doubt it, because, although I look back at our fling with fondness, the most prevailing memory I have of that weekend is of my feet feeling like two blocks of ice that would never be warm again.",Lifestyle/Life and style,My winter of love: The lesbian gathering was freezing cold.

12/22/2021,"Dozens of asylum seekers are begging Boris Johnson to help rehouse them, claiming the Home Office accommodation in his constituency is not fit to live in. The 18 rundown flats in Uxbridge and South Ruislip have housed some asylum seekers for years without any improvements being made – despite repeated complaints. Each apartment has five tiny bedrooms and no communal space, besides kitchens and bathrooms left filthy from a lack of maintenance.  Some residents are victims of torture, have been trafficked and have faced other forms of persecution. One man says he is a victim of organ theft, having a kidney stolen by an organ smuggling ring while en route to the UK. A charity supporting him said he has made several suicide attempts. The rooms are so small there is only space for a bed and a cupboard. Damp and mould are rife, while water leaks from walls and through ceilings. Rodents and cockroaches are also a problem. Broken appliances such as fridge-freezers and vacuum cleaners are not removed from the properties, even though space is scarce. The flats were provided by Clearsprings, the Home Office contractor that provides accommodation for asylum seekers in some parts of the UK. When charity workers asked the firm’s accommodation manager if the flat put aside for one asylum seeker was kept to a decent standard, the manager replied “lol”. A screenshot of the exchange of the messages has been shared with Clearsprings but it declined to comment. A Home Office spokesperson said that the accommodation “clearly falls short of the high standards we expect from our contractors, who are now resolving this”. Hillingdon council has organised an urgent inspection of all the flats on Wednesday to investigate whether the accommodation meets minimum standards of “repair, safety and comfort”. Residents claim the power has been switched off at night to save money. People have also complained the hot water is turned off without warning. The landlord told the Guardian he knew nothing about these claims and was not responsible for the maintenance of the accommodation. Cromwell, the firm that manages the properties, said: “We take residents’ safety and wellbeing very seriously and will always carry out repairs reported to us promptly.” An asylum seeker who was imprisoned in his home country said: “The room I have to live in is the same size as my prison cell in Iran.” A teenager from Sudan, who looks much younger than his 18 years and spent five years travelling in extremely difficult conditions before reaching the UK, told the Guardian that a hole in his sloping roof means that water pours in when it rains. “When the water comes I put plastic bags on my bed to keep it dry and crawl under the bed to keep dry and sleep there,” he said. One resident repeatedly complained to Home Office contractors and Hillingdon council that smoke and fumes were entering the flat from a nearby restaurant’s grill extractor. The asylum seeker claims to have then developed breathing difficulties. He eventually made a complaint to the local ombudsman for failing to investigate appropriately. The ombudsman ruled against the council and said it was at fault for failing to investigate the issue properly and had caused injustice to the asylum seeker who complained. The ombudsman’s report, published in January, called on officials to inspect the property. The council said it had made two unannounced inspections in September and November but did not identify smoke during its visit. A spokesperson said the asylum seekers in the flat have been asked to contact them when the problem occurs so they can come and inspect then. The asylum seeker said: “I have lived here for more than five years and have complained many times but nothing is done. When I contacted Boris Johnson’s constituency office a few years ago about problems with the accommodation they helped. But I contacted them again asking for help because of our bad living conditions at the beginning of the pandemic and never got any response. I have asked the prime minister to help us get out of this place.” Boris Johnson’s constituency office has been approached for comment. Hannah Marwood of the charity Care4Calais said: “We were horrified to see the conditions that so many people have been living in for so long. This is not the first time we have supported people in such unacceptable accommodation. It is an undignified and ultimately unsafe way to be forced to live.” The Home Office spokesperson added: “We are dealing with unprecedented pressures on the asylum system but, despite this, we continue to ensure the accommodation provided is safe, comfortable and secure.”",News/UK news,Asylum seekers in PM’s constituency claim accommodation ‘not fit to live in’ ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/22/asylum-seekers-in-pms-constituency-claim-accommodation-not-fit-to-live-in
12/22/2021,"Last Friday, Charlamagne Tha God had a remote sit-down with Kamala Harris for his new late-night chatshow Tha God’s Honest Truth on Comedy Central. It was a big moment for a legendary provocateur who in little more than a decade has gone from dismissable radio sidekick to the leading interviewer on urban radio, as at ease grilling presidents as japing with Migos. During his interview with Harris, it seemed as if the host, real name Lenard Larry McKelvey, would bite his tongue and give the vice-president space to hit back at the legion of critics who moan about her not doing more. But what seemed like a softball interview quickly changed tone when Charlamagne asked her, point blank: “Who is the real president of this country, Joe Biden or Joe Manchin?”  As soon as he asked the question, Harris’s spokesperson Symone Sanders swooped in and demanded a stop to the interview, citing audio difficulties. Seated in a gaming chair, Charlamagne swiveled around to face his studio audience. “They’re acting like they can’t hear me, y’all,” he snarked. When Harris confirmed that she could indeed hear him, he repeated the question. “C’mon, Charlamagne,” she scolded with a wagging finger. “Don’t start talking like a Republican. It’s Joe Biden, and I’m vice-president and my name is Kamala Harris.” Her defiant response might have gone down as one beleaguered politician’s attempt to win points with her boss if it hadn’t been followed by news of Manchin’s Senate-chamber nuking of the Biden administration’s signature Build Back Better legislation the next day. Rather surprisingly, Charlamagne had stumbled into something that’s become increasingly rare in Washington: a genuine moment. The Harris interview now enters the pantheon of Tha God’s honest gotcha moments. Before that, there was Biden telling Charlamagne during the 2020 election that African Americans who didn’t turn out for him “ain’t Black”. (Biden’s handlers tried shutting down that interview, too.) There was him calling Elizabeth Warren “the original Rachel Dolezal” while cross-examining her about her false claims to Native American ancestry. And there was him going all Jim Acosta on Hilary Clinton when the then presidential candidate came clean with her habit of carrying hot sauce in her purse. “Now,” he joked, “I just want you to know people are gonna see this and say, ‘OK, she’s pandering to Black people.’” To which she asked, “Is it working?” If the Moncks Corner, South Carolina, native has a gift for producing cringey exchanges, it’s because Charlamagne learned from one of the best line-steppers while a sidekick to Wendy Williams in the late aughts on New York’s WBLS R&B radio station and on VH1. But where Williams, although risqué, could reliably flirt her way back to safety in interviews, Charlamagne became notorious for rankling the industry’s popular and powerful. He spent a year out of work after parting ways with Williams before the iHeart radio network brought him back to New York in 2010 to anchor the hip-hop station Power 105.1’s Breakfast Club show: a kind of Good Morning America for the streets known for its no-holds-barred interviews with Black luminaries in music, on screen and in sports. And while he’s done as much as the co-hosts DJ Envy and Angela Yee to elevate Birdman’s walkout, Soulja Boy’s meltdown and Monique’s Netflix controversy into memes, it’s Charlamagne’s sociopolitical curiosity that’s made the show an important stop for thought leaders and policymakers. Two bestselling biographies have only given him further standing to lead those discussions. All the while a shadowy past looms just as large. He’s talked openly about serving jail time for dealing drugs as a teenager. In 2018, he was forced to reckon with a 2001 rape charge when his accuser, who was 15 at the time, sought to reopen the case. (Ultimately, a special prosecutor declined, citing the three years’ probation Charlamagne served after agreeing to a plea deal on a less serious charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.) Around the same time, a 2015 podcast interview resurfaced in which Charlamagne seems to characterize his first sexual encounter with his now wife, Jessica Gadsden, as rape, saying that she was too drunk to meaningfully consent. (“For the record, in 1997 I was having consensual sex,” he’d say later. Gadsden, too, appeared on the Breakfast Club in his defense.) None of it this has appeared to dim his stardom, nor has it stopped him positioning himself as an ally of the #MeToo and social justice movements. If anything, Charlamagne’s career has taken the same shape as those of Don Imus and Howard Stern before him. Which is to say he’s a Teflon-grade, old-school shock-jock. Before the late-night chat with Harris, who stopped by the Breakfast Club during her presidential campaign to reminisce about her days as a weed-smoking Howard University sorority girl who now vibes to Tupac and Snoop, it was Charlamagne scoring the first interview with Travis Scott since the Astroworld festival disaster that had the media buzzing. But for all of his confrontational instincts, Charlamagne doesn’t have the combative chops of John Oliver or Jordan Klepper, who cut their teeth on Comedy Central. He is largely deferential to distinguished “gets”. Even the testy exchange between Charlamagne and the vice-president ended with him telling her, with a hand on heart, “we need you to be the superhero who saves democracy” and her gesturing in kind while saying “I wanna see those babies”. By that, of course, she means his kids, an indication that these two sparring partners might actually be friends.",Arts/Television & radio,How Charlamagne became Tha God of headline-grabbing interviews,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/21/charlamagne-tha-god-kamala-harris-interview
12/22/2021,"How was it possible to enjoy It’s a Sin, knowing what was to come? Russell T Davies’s great skill was in making it seem like it would be rude not to. It might have been reasonable to expect a certain solemnity from this five-part drama about the arrival of Aids in Britain and the devastation it wrought, but what was less predictable, perhaps, was the furious, beautiful joy of it. It was gut-wrenching and it was terrible, but god, it was funny and it was full of life. The story corralled a group of young men into the flatshare that would become known as the “Pink Palace”, under the capable watch of house mother-type Jill (Lydia West). At the centre of this ensemble was Ritchie (Years & Years’ Olly Alexander, returning to his former acting career), a bright-eyed dreamer who arrives in London to become an actor; Colin, a sweet-natured walking anorak who eventually swaps his suburban digs for a room in the house; and Roscoe (Omari Douglas), a tart-tongued queen who flames out of a meal with his traditional Nigerian family with inimitable style, eventually finding himself at the heart of the British establishment, in a roundabout sort of way.  Like most of Davies’s shows, from the pioneering Queer As Folk to the Nostradamus-esque Years and Years, it had a defiant bounce to it, a sense of humour that made the darkest moments all the more heart-rending. Ritchie and Roscoe discover a lively gay scene in the city’s pubs and clubs, bringing the party home with them as they learn about sex by having lots of it. (A scene in the first episode, in which Ritchie learns about sexual hygiene, felt quietly revolutionary.) Colin finds a different side of gay life, at first, through his colleague Henry, an older man who lives with his partner in the shadows and tries not to rock the boat. It is Henry who disappears first, as a mysterious new illness arrives, hitting a now-familiar wall of fear, denial and misinformation. The disappearances keep coming. Friends from the scene “go home” to their families and never return, lost to what relatives might decide to call cancer. In March 2020, the former Conservative MP Ann Widdecombe wrote a column for the Daily Express suggesting that Aids was one of a number of frightening epidemics that had not “proved as devastating as feared”. Though this series finished filming before the current pandemic, it stands as a riposte to such an abhorrent idea. The sheer waste of lives is devastating. It’s a Sin dealt with complicated ideas, too, which made it a talking point. As the title makes clear, it puts the notions of gay shame and pride up for discussion – that complex concoction of ego and self-loathing – as Ritchie first denies Aids, arguing it is a tool of oppression used by authorities to stop gay men having sex. Eventually the conversation shifts on to his mother, a magnificent Keeley Hawes, who battles it out with Jill until the very end, when both are broken, in different ways. The notion of family looms large here, both given and chosen. The Pink Palace is chosen family, right down to the “La!” that unites them. Roscoe rejects his real family before they can reject him, but later finds reconciliation with his sister. Colin’s mother knows nothing of his life until he is stricken and nonsensical in a hospital bed, in some of the show’s most painful scenes, but she finds solace in his friends, who rally round her. And Ritchie’s family – his disapproving, distant father and hard, brittle mother – are infuriating and cruel, but crucially, also human. They love their son, and the loss of him will destroy them. It’s a Sin was full of humanity. It had to be. Mistakes are made, because that’s what people do. Ritchie makes big mistakes, from his refusal to get tested and his self-destructive promiscuity, even when he knows what the cost might be, but small ones, too, like his bleak attempt to seduce an old school friend, to make himself feel better. Judgment is mostly absent, reserved for those who most deserve it. It is the institutional mistakes, deliberate refusals to engage with what happened, and not the personal ones, which are the sources of rage. This was television full of energy and vitality. That’s not to say it failed to take its subject matter seriously enough. It’s a Sin was deeply upsetting, as it was supposed to be, and Davies made us love these characters, flaws and all, before he took them away. I cried at the end of the first episode, knowing what was going to happen, and I wept as it did happen, again and again. The real-world effects of this historical piece came quickly: requests for HIV tests shot up, and a significant amount of money was raised for the Terrence Higgins Trust through sales of a T-shirt bearing the word “La”. Its cast and creator spoke of people whose memories were excavated by the show; young people talked about stories they had not known; activists discussed and argued its finer points. The people who died of Aids were commemorated. Sometimes television is more than just storytelling, even if storytelling is all it strives to do. How was it possible to enjoy it? Because even though we knew some of these men would not survive, Davies made us care deeply about their lives. Even at their most flawed, and most infuriating, we were willing them to live.",Arts/Television & radio,"The 50 best TV shows of 2021, No 1: It’s a Sin",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/22/the-50-best-tv-shows-of-2021-no-1-its-a-sin
12/22/2021,"Suspected Covid outbreaks in hospitals across the UK have doubled in a week, official figures reveal – though the number of people admitted to wards with the virus is falling across much of England. As parts of the NHS battle to cope with a surge in infected staff and patients, UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) data show there were 66 acute respiratory infection incidents in UK hospitals in the seven days to 16 December.  Coronavirus was confirmed in most of these incidents, according to a UKHSA document reviewed, by the Guardian. It represents a doubling in outbreaks compared with the previous week (33) and is the highest total recorded since the third week of January 2020. Most of the outbreaks happened in London, with 28 recorded in the last week, almost half of all those in England (62). Nine were recorded in West Midlands hospitals, six in the east of England and five in the east Midlands. Hospitals are scrambling to try to stop the highly transmissible Omicron variant spreading between patients and staff, NHS leaders said, while trying to cope with more pressure than last year. Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, said: “The safety of staff and patients is a key priority of trust leaders, and trusts are doing everything they can to keep nosocomial [hospital-acquired] infections to a minimum, including following stringent infection control measures and social distancing rules.” Increasing numbers of NHS trusts were now having to scale back care, she said, because they were under greater pressure overall than the previous big wave of Covid last winter, even though hospital admissions were lower. Nationally, the NHS has not yet experienced a major rise in Covid hospital admissions but there were significant regional variations. In London, admissions doubled in the last three weeks, and in north-west England the seven-day growth rate was 14%, the Health Service Journal (HSJ) reported. Covid admissions were falling in the south-east, south-west, the east of England, the north-east and Yorkshire, and the Midlands. NHS officials have remained concerned, though, as hospital admissions reflect infections picked up on average about a fortnight previously, suggesting a sharp rise was already almost certain. The increase in hospital outbreaks reflected rapidly rising levels of the virus among the population, they said. However, the 100% rise in one week was 10 times the increase in outbreaks seen in care homes, where such incidents were now lower than levels recorded in November. The British Medical Association has predicted that anywhere between 32,000 and 130,000 NHS staff in England could be off sick by Christmas Day. Guy’s and St Thomas’ trust in London told staff last Friday that it was facing “significant shortages” because 350 employees were off because of Covid, a figure that had increased 25% in just 24 hours. Ben Travis, chief executive of Lewisham and Greenwich trust, last week told staff it would soon have to take “difficult decisions” about whether it could keep providing usual services in the face of the Omicron surge, including non-urgent surgery. One specialist lung doctor in north-west England said: “Numbers have gone up on both the ward and intensive treatment unit. Incidental swab positive – people coming in with something else [but then] swabbing positive – is a problem.” But Dr Nick Scriven, a past president of the Society for Acute Medicine, who is a consultant in Yorkshire, said: “Our Covid numbers today are probably lower than at any time in the last 12 months at least. We can only hope that the spread will be attenuated by the booster programme and that illness requiring hospitalisation will be reduced, as with the current ongoing pressure there is realistically no room to expand unless the elective work is again cancelled – which I get the feeling is now the very last resort.”",News/Society,Suspected Covid outbreaks in UK hospitals double in a week,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/22/suspected-covid-outbreaks-in-uk-hospitals-double-in-a-week
12/22/2021,"South Korea is struggling to contain a surge in Covid-19 cases, reporting 7,456 infections on Wednesday and a record number of people with serious symptoms, as countries across Asia face a similar battle. The new infections bring South Korea’s total to 583,065, while the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency said the number of critically ill patients rose to a new high of 1,063.  It is placing intense pressure on medical services, prompting the prime minister, Kim Boo-kyum, to commit to securing an additional 10,000 hospital beds for patients with moderate to serious symptoms by the middle of next month, the Yonhap news agency reported. South Korea now requires citizens over 18 to present a quarantine pass, proof of Covid vaccination or negative PCR test to access indoor sports events, cinemas and concert halls. Other new restrictions include social distancing measures that will last until at least 2 January, limiting gatherings to no more than four people and forcing restaurants, cafes and bars to close by 9pm. Neighbouring Japan has decided to extend strict border controls “for the time being”, the prime minister, Fumio Kishida, said despite criticism from students waiting to take up university places and families who say they have been unfairly separated by the restrictions. Kishida had originally said those measures would stay in place until early January. Japan is recording comparatively few daily cases, but Kishida warned of the need to remain vigilant, speed up the booster rollout and promote the use of orally administered Covid-19 drugs, the Kyodo news agency said. Currently only citizens and foreign residents are permitted to enter Japan, and they must quarantine in government-designated facilities. Thailand reported 2,532 new coronavirus cases and 31 deaths on Wednesday, according to the ministry of health. It will reinstate mandatory Covid quarantine for foreign visitors and scrap a quarantine waiver from Tuesday, Reuters reported. The move was confirmed by the government, which said the action was being taken due to concerns over the spread of the Omicron variant. China, where the pandemic began two years ago, is fighting local outbreaks in several cities, including key industrial hubs in the east and south. Authorities are determined to quash fresh outbreaks ahead of a crucial few weeks that include the Beijing Winter Olympics in February and a surge in domestic travel during the lunar new year. China’s health authority reported 77 new confirmed cases on Tuesday, down from 81 a day earlier. Of the new infections, 57 were locally transmitted, according to a statement by the National Health Commission, and mostly in the north-western province of Shaanxi. The Philippines has halved the waiting time for a Covid-19 vaccine booster to three months after a second vaccination, in an attempt to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant. “We are exploring all possible options to safely mitigate the effects of more transmissible variants of Covid-19,” said the health secretary, Francisco Duque. The Philippines has received more than 192m doses of Covid-19 vaccines and fully inoculated about 44.2 million of its 110 million population, according to the government. Covid-19 cases have fallen to an average of 378 a day in December, from a peak of 18,579 daily in September, and the country has so far detected three imported cases of the Omicron variant. The new variant is also present in Singapore, where authorities have discovered three Covid-19 cases linked to a gym, with two of them being Omicron, according to a report citing preliminary tests. All three people were fully vaccinated and had mild symptoms, the health ministry said, adding that it was attempting to trace contacts. Singapore has so far detected 71 confirmed Omicron cases, with 65 imported and six local. Indonesia has recorded 4,829 cases and 11 deaths in its latest reporting period, bringing its total caseload to 4.26 million with 144,024 deaths, according to government health data. A total of 73.4% of eligible people have received at least one Covid vaccine dose and 51.8% have received two doses. On Monday, Indonesia added people traveling from Britain, Norway and Denmark to the list of those banned from entering the country, while Hong Kong was removed, senior minister Luhut Binsar Panjaitan said, according to Reuters. Indonesia identified its first case of the Omicron variant last week.",News/World news,"Covid cases rise across Asia as South Korea sees record numbers of seriously ill, Thailand restarts quarantine",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/22/covid-cases-rise-across-asia-as-south-korea-sees-record-numbers-of-seriously-ill-thailand-restarts-quarantine
12/22/2021,"The first big blows of north-easterlies brought down fieldfares from Scandinavia with snow on their wings and beaks sharpened in frost and ice. Their redwing cousins seeped into Britain all through the autumn, but fieldfares are true winter thrushes, best served up chilled to the British countryside. At the tail end of November, a fellow birder in Lancashire emailed me a reply – “redwings yes, fieldfares none”. I missed their calls, those endearing rattles that remind me of customers passing through a faulty turnstile. And now, carried in by cold winds, they’re back, chack-a-chack, bouncing across the field in a straggly flock maybe 50-strong, self-choreographing into the topmost branches of a rowan. Silhouetted against the sky, they adopt an identical stance, pointing due north, stuck all over the tree like so many Christmas baubles. Motionless and now mute – they scarcely speak when still – the fieldfares perch as if awaiting instruction.  Fieldfares were ever present here in the first months of the year, an infectious antidote to lockdown, for they were everything it wasn’t – gregarious, exuberant, highly mobile chatterers, riding out over our grounded troubles. One morning they hedge-hopped down the lane on either side of me shouting “this way!” and their excitable cries had me racing to keep up. Running with fieldfares? Silly man. A soundless exhortation now shakes them out of the rowan, like a fist exploding into an open palm, the birds fanning northwards on a broad front. In a rebellious instant, one bird breaks away from the splintering flock, taking a wide arc to the east and then banking round to head south. I see it cut a lone path across my path, a high flyer, with that typical fieldfare tilt towards the sun. Then the whole flock it has left appears to vote in midair: ayes to the right. One, two, four birds sheer off, triggering the whole group to bend and coalesce behind them, now in an unusually tight formation. They are drawn into the slipstream of the breakaway bird and the flock tilts, this time to the right. Westward ho!
