1/16/2022,"Today’s Opinium poll for the Observer is grim reading for Boris Johnson and his party. Johnson’s personal approvals fall below the worst figures ever recorded by Theresa May; and his party sinks to its worst vote share since the general election, 10 points behind Labour. Majorities of practically every political and demographic group believe Johnson and his colleagues have broken the rules and lied about it, and say Johnson should resign.  Until recently, the wobbly wing of the Conservative coalition looked to be better off Remainers in the South of England. Yet today’s poll adds to growing evidence that the “partygate” scandal is jeopardising the party’s support from “red wall” Leavers too. Such voters have long felt disaffected from and distrustful of a political class they felt ignored their concerns and lived by its own rules. The resentments once mobilised against the EU by the promise to “Take Back Control” now have a new target – an out of touch Downing Street team who partied while the Queen mourned. Johnson himself has shifted from the party’s biggest asset, with a Brexit-fuelled appeal separate to the Conservative brand to its biggest liability, as the revelations of Downing Street revelry in lockdown render him personally toxic with the same voters. The Conservatives may now be damned if they do and damned if they don’t. Sticking with Johnson risks further contaminating the party brand if the scandals continue and voter fury intensifies. Party veterans with memories of the 1990s will recall how hard renewal can become once their party is toxic. Yet replacing Johnson brings its own risks, as none of the front runners for the succession looks likely to replicate his unique appeal with voters otherwise suspicious of the Conservatives. The geography of the electoral battlefield intensifies this dilemma. The voters who switched to the Conservatives in 2019 were clustered in the crucial swing seats, while Labour’s post-Brexit base of young graduates and ethnic minorities was concentrated in seats the party already held. The current scandal-driven collapse could throw the same dynamic into reverse as the voters most angered by shameless rule breaking and barely credible excuse-making flock together in the battleground seats likely to decide the next election. Yet there is little comfort for Johnson’s party in the more traditional Tory strongholds either. The Conservatives are losing even more ground among the better-off, Remain-leaning voters who formed the pre-Brexit base of the party, and whose suspicions of Johnson were only over-ridden in 2019 by fear of a Corbyn government. A slump in both new and old heartlands would be a dire scenario indeed, but one which must be taken seriously in an era where partisan loyalties are weak and voters more volatile than ever. Mid-term blues are common. The Conservatives have trailed Labour badly before only to rebound at election time. But the comeback wins in 2015 and 2019 were both fuelled by recruiting nationalist Eurosceptics from Nigel Farage, and by exploiting voter distrust of unpopular Labour opponents. There is no Farage party to squeeze today, and Keir Starmer’s personal ratings, though mediocre, are better than his predecessor and improving. The Conservatives’ hopes may now rest on whether voters’ longstanding reservations about Labour outweigh their growing anger at a prime minister now widely seen as a liar and a law-breaker unfit for office. A slender reed indeed.

1/16/2022,"Are you in control of your smartphone or is it in control of you? Sometimes it is difficult to tell. One minute you might be using FaceTime to chat with loved ones or talking about your favourite TV show on Twitter. Next, you’re stuck in a TikTok “scroll hole” or tapping your 29th email notification of the day and no longer able to focus on anything else. We often feel like we can’t pull ourselves away from our devices. As various psychologists and Silicon Valley whistleblowers have stated, that is by design.  Many people are making efforts to resist and step away from their smartphones. A 2021 survey by research company GWI found that people of all ages limit the time they spend on social media – especially younger respondents. Twenty-five per cent of gen Z and 23% of millennials said they now look at social apps less to help manage their mental health. But as recent studies suggest, not all tech time is created equal. Passively scrolling Facebook and comparing your life with other people’s has never been a recipe for happiness. But actively using Twitter for social support can be. So instead of setting well-intentioned but ultimately unsustainable resolutions or signing up for some kind of extreme “digital detox”, think about changing the settings on some of your apps to make them less of a time sink. Mute people and topicsSome people might call it cancelling, but we prefer the term “curation”. You can improve your Twitter experience by muting anything you’d rather not see, such as fad diet tips, Black Friday offers or movie spoilers. It’s easy to do – and undo. For people, simply tap the three dots on their profile and hit “mute”. You’ll no longer see their tweets, but they won’t know. Do the same for words, phrases, film titles or anything else. Go to “settings”, find “privacy and safety”, tap “mute and block” and then press the “+” sign and add anything you want to blot out. Disable read receiptsSending a message and being “left on read” is a huge source of stress for many of us. So is receiving a message and feeling like you have to stop everything you’re doing and reply urgently. Disabling read receipts can quickly reduce these pressures and paranoias. Go to “settings”, then “account”, select “privacy” and toggle read receipts off. Now you won’t see the dreaded blue ticks, and neither will the people you message. Neutralise your news feedIt has undermined 21st-century democracy but if you can’t face leaving, the next best thing is to delete the Facebook app from your phone and make Facebook a desktop-only experience. By doing this, you can reduce the overwhelming stream of random memes and iffy politics by adding a browser extension, such as “News Feed Eradicator” for Chrome, which hides the news feed and displays an inspiring quote instead. Hide your like countBeing a confident, resilient individual, you aren’t concerned with how many “likes” your latest post earns, but you probably know someone who is. Here’s what they should do: remove the like count. On a post, hit the three dots in the top right-hand corner and select “hide like count”. Now, if you click through to who’s liked a photo, only you can see the number of likes. Keen to take it one step further? Hide everyone else’s like counts in “settings”, tap “privacy”, select “posts”, and toggle “hide like and view counts” to on. This makes Instagram feel less like a popularity contest. Remove related videosDelete the YouTube app from your phone and commit to only watching it on your desktop. Then you can add a browser extension to give you more control. For example, “Improve YouTube” is an extension for Chrome that has a bunch of features to improve your viewing, the best of which hides the “related videos” sidebar. This aspect of YouTube can so often eat up more of your time than you’d intended by sending you down a video rabbit hole. Set a time limitTikTok can feel like an alternative dimension. You think you’ve spent five minutes watching videos of dogs in hats, when somehow an hour has passed you by. Take control of your viewing by setting a time limit within the app itself. Go to “settings”, “digital wellbeing” and then “screen-time management” to select a time limit of 40, 60, 90 or 120 minutes a day. When your time is up, you’ll need to enter a passcode to keep using TikTok, which should be the nudge you need to go do something else. Take a hard lineHow often is your eye drawn by a new, and ultimately irrelevant, notification lighting up your smartphone screen? With most apps they are enabled by default. Think carefully: do you really want to be repeatedly jabbed in the brain by assorted social media platforms, ancient acquaintances and pizza delivery companies? Probably not. Instead, decide which ones you really need. Calendar reminders, yes. That someone you’ve not spoken to in 20 years who has “liked” one of your photos, no. Interestingly, a 2021 study found 89% of phone disruptions are caused by a need to check, not notifications. But getting a grip on notifications could help you get a handle on your phone-checking habit – just try to stick with it past a few days. Be strong. Check emails twice a dayThere are 101 methods that claim to remove the stress from your inbox, from the zero-inbox approach to adding colourful folders or filters. But one straightforward new email habit is: check your emails only once – or twice, if you have to – a day. This is a productivity tip long recommended by Tim Ferriss, the author of The 4-Hour Workweek. You’ll need to turn off email notifications and set an alarm to remind you to check. Scheduling emails will make things easier, staggering replies so your inbox isn’t full again within minutes. You can also create an autoreply explaining your email method and that senders shouldn’t expect an instant response. Unfollow annoying peopleA useful feature on LinkedIn allows you to unfollow someone so you don’t see their updates. Plenty of people know this feature exists but don’t use it enough. Next time someone humblebrags about their new promotion, Ted talk or number of Substack followers on LinkedIn, consider unfollowing them. It’s easier to reverse than removing or unfriending them, and a good option for colleagues you don’t want to offend – because they won’t see they’ve been unfollowed. Make yourself unavailableGet rid of the green dot that pops up next to your name in Messenger, showing everyone you know that you’re online. It’s only useful on rare occasions, and the rest of the time this glowing green badge is the online equivalent of having a Post-it stuck to your forehead that says “please talk to me” on it. Head to Messenger, tap your profile, select “active status” and toggle this option off.
