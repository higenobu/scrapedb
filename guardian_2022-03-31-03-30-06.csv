3/31/2022,"A prominent Indian journalist has been prevented from flying to Europe to speak about intimidation of journalists and rights in the world’s largest democracy. Rana Ayyub, an outspoken critic of the government of Narendra Modi and columnist for the Washington Post, was not allowed to board a flight at Mumbai airport on Tuesday. She had been due to travel to London to address a conference at the International Centre for Journalists. “I was stopped today at the Indian immigration while I was about to board my flight to London to deliver my speech on the intimidation of journalists with @ICFJ. I was to travel to Italy right after to deliver the keynote address at the @journalismfest on the Indian democracy,” she said in a tweet. Ayyub said she had previously publicised her planned trips on social media but the Enforcement Directorate – which investigates economic crimes such as money laundering – issued a last-minute summons to appear at its offices while she was already at the airports. The International Centre for Journalists protested in a tweet. “ICFJ stands with @RanaAyyub and we reiterate our demand for the Indian authorities to end their legal and digital harassment campaign against the multi-award-winning @washingtonpost journalist. #LetRanaFly #WeStandWithRana.” Ayyub, 37, says she has been subjected to harassment by far-right Hindu groups because of her reporting. Her book, Gujarat Files, on the anti-Muslim pogram in 2002, accuses Modi, who was ruling the state at the time, of being complicit in the atrocity. In February, UN rights experts called on the government to stop “misogynistic and sectarian” online attacks against her. Under the Modi government, journalists and civil rights activists have complained of curtailed freedom and harassment. In 2020 Muslim comedian Munawar Faruqui spent weeks in jail over a supposedly anti-Hindu joke he had not told. Facebook posts disparaging the government can occasionally result in a knock on the door by a policeman. The directorate’s summons relates to an investigation it is carrying out into alleged misuse of public donations collected by Ayyub for humanitarian relief work. It alleges that she used the funds for her personal use and submitted fake bills to claim expenses. In February, the directorate froze more than 15 million rupees in her accounts. She has denied the allegations. Analysts say that the directorate is routinely used as a tool by governments of every stripe to intimidate and silence opposition politicians and others by accusing them of corruption or money laundering.",News/World news,Indian journalist prevented from flying to Europe to speak about intimidation,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/30/indian-journalist-prevented-from-flying-to-europe-to-speak-about-intimidation
3/31/2022,"A 15-year-old boy has been found guilty of killing a teenager, who was “hunted down” by a group of five and stabbed. Birmingham crown court heard how Dea-John Reid, 14, was chased by the group in May 2021 who behaved “like a pack chasing down their prey”, before the 15-year-old delivered the fatal stab wound. Jurors deliberated over three days before acquitting four other defendants of murdering Dea-John, who died from a single stab wound to the chest. The 15-year-old was acquitted of murder but convicted of his manslaughter. The defendants cleared were George Khan, 39, Michael Shields, 36, and two teenagers aged 15 and 16 who cannot be named because of their age. Tim Clark QC, representing the 15-year-old found guilty of stabbing Dea-John, said: “He accepts he caused the death of Dea-John but did not intend to kill him. He was acting in self-defence.” Police charged four members of the group under the law of joint enterprise, meaning that although they did not deliver the fatal blow, they could be liable for the killing if it was decided they would likely have foreseen their associate would commit it. Representatives for the acquitted defendants said they did not intend to kill or cause serious injury to Dea-John, and some said they were not aware anyone was carrying a knife. Prosecutor Richard Wormald QC told the court the killing was a “revenge attack” for events earlier in the day, in which Dea-John had been out with friends and one of the group was accused of trying to steal a bag from the 16-year-old defendant. Driven by Khan, all five travelled to the Kingstanding area together later on to “hunt him down”. “It was a group attack during which they each played their part, running after Dea-John and blocking off his escape routes,” he said. “This was a concerted plan. All five had been together in the car. It is inconceivable they would not have been aware that lethal weapons were being carried,” he told the court, as reported by the Birmingham Mail. “Threatening and violent words were used. This is not a case of self defence or of some defendants not knowing what was happening. They were in it all together.” The court was shown footage of the moment Dea-John was fatally stabbed, in which all five defendants could be seen chasing him, some brandishing weapons, before running away. “Having carried out the attack the group all then made off in haste – not one of them offered any support or comfort to Dea-John Reid. They simply left him to die,” Wormald said. Dea-John died at the scene and a postmortem examination confirmed the cause of death as a stab wound to the heart. Speaking after his death, Dea-John’s mother, Joan Morris, described her son as a talented young man. “I sent my son to go and play football and he didn’t come home. I miss my son so much, he was a lovely kid,” she said. “What am I supposed to do without him?” Bishop Desmond Jaddoo, a community activist and spokesperson for Dea-John’s family, said they were “mortified” by the verdict. “His family are of the opinion that there is no justice for Dea-John,” he said, adding the evidence “clearly shows intent” as the defendant chased the victim while covering his face and carrying a knife. “This does ask the question is the criminal justice system fit for purpose? Where is the justice for Dea-John?” Jaddoo said. “Dea-John’s death will not be in vain and the inequality that exists within the criminal justice system needs to be addressed.” Hundreds attended a vigil in the days after the attack, which inflamed community tensions after reports Dea-John had been subjected to racial abuse before he was killed. A sixth defendant, Hollie Davies, 36, was also acquitted of assisting an offender. The convicted teenager will be sentenced on 5 May.",News/UK news,"Dea-John Reid: boy, 15, convicted of Birmingham killing and four others cleared",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/30/dea-john-reid-boy-15-convicted-of-birmingham-killing-and-four-others-cleared
3/31/2022,"The drivers may be the stars of the show but when considering the fallout from the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix they should have no illusions as to where they stand in the eyes of the people running Formula One. A sport which now declares its moral stance beyond judgment will have no fear of putting pay day before the men delivering the show on track. There was clear distaste from some in even being in Saudi Arabia, expressed once more by Lewis Hamilton, who was blunt in noting at the end of the weekend that he was: “just looking forward to getting out”. That statement that will sit uncomfortably with the Saudi ambition of selling their state as a destination for the post-oil future. F1 has done a deal to race in Saudi Arabia for 10 years worth a reported £50m a year and it has the state-owned oil company Aramco as a global partner. Yet while the arguments against grand prix racing in Saudi Arabia came thick and fast over the weekend, when F1’s chief, Stefano Domenicali, was asked if the sport was putting money before morals, he dismissed it. “No one can judge our morality, to be honest,” he said. “It is a matter of putting in place all the things that have to be considered. Where is the line? That is the question. Our position, and it will always be, is that we believe that what we’re doing will have a very positive impact in all the political situations for the best of our life and at all levels.” Few drivers, it seems, were feeling any positive impact this year. Hamilton’s stance is unsurprising given Saudi Arabia’s terrible human rights record is well documented but when a missile strike hit just six miles from the circuit on the Friday before the race, F1 faced a rebellion. F1 and the team principals came to a swift agreement that all was well while the drivers in a separate meeting came to the opposite decision, that the race should be cancelled. Their boycott was headed off only after a meeting with F1 and the team principals who put the case for their safety. Part of the argument used to placate them was believed to include an agreement that they would have a discussion about the race – including whether it should remain on the calendar. Those talks will doubtless take place but F1, as the commercial rights holder, will make the decision on where they race and it is clear those decisions are not going to be influenced by the drivers. Domenicali as good as spelled this out when when asked if there was a question mark over the future of the race in Saudi Arabia. “It is a matter of understanding the situation,” he said. “We are not blind, but we should not forget one thing: this country and the sport is taking a massive step forward. You cannot pretend to change a culture of more than a millennium in the blink of an eye.” This is F1’s most hackneyed refrain, that they can effect positive change. Yet their argument is not backed up by any evidence. Jonathan Grix, professor of sport policy and politics at the Manchester Metropolitan University, argues the Saudis are sportwashing and that F1 is complicit. “Money is the driver and unfortunately it does override morals and principles,” he says. “That argument of bringing change has been used by many sports organisations. It was the same with Brazil when they gave them the 2014 and 2016 World Cup and then Olympics. The biggest events you can get and it didn’t do anything. There was no change at all.” F1 surely already has all the evidence it needs of effecting positive change in having held a race in Bahrain for a decade since the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings were suppressed there. Yet they offer no examples of what benefits the sport has brought in that time, while other organisations argue the exact opposite is the case. “The grim reality on the ground in Bahrain, after a decade of consecutive races, is one of increased institutionalised repression and an unprecedented use of the death penalty,” says Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, director at the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy. “Year after year, things are going from bad to worse. The truth is, as a morally corrupt enterprise, F1’s sole interest is driven by financial profits.” F1 is far from the only guilty party in this rush for payment to paper over unpleasant truths as Grix notes of Fifa in awarding the 2022 World Cup to Qatar. “This idea of the slow process of democratisation over time via the vehicle of sport, I have not seen any evidence of it, I don’t believe it,” he says. “It is the same argument about the kafala system in Qatar, any significant changes to the system remain to be seen.” Yet the demand to host prestigious events is so strong in many of these countries, that sports could wield their power to greater effect than merely hoping their presence will shine a spotlight on the issues. “They are in a position to make those kind of demands,” argues Grix. “We want to effect change, if we don’t see change then we are not going to hold an event like this in a country like yours.” There is no sign of any such ultimatums being made. Instead every year F1 lends another veneer of legitimacy to states paying for exactly that. The drivers might not like it, they might not enjoy racing in a war zone, but for all the weight they carry it pales into insignificance to the avarice of a sport that has long since decided to follow the money, and morals be damned.",Sport/Sport,F1 claims to nurture positive change but clearly puts money before morals,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/30/formula-1-saudi-arabia-human-rights-sportwashing
3/31/2022,"The Maine senator Susan Collins will vote to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson to the US supreme court, giving Joe Biden’s nominee a rare Republican vote as she proceeds towards becoming the first Black woman ever to sit on the nine-judge panel. “I have decided to support the confirmation of Judge Jackson to be a member of the supreme court,” Collins, a Republican moderate, told the New York Times after meeting the nominee a second time. “There can be no question that [Jackson] is qualified to be a supreme court justice.” The confirmation was not in doubt. Democrats need only their own 50 votes in the evenly divided Senate to put Jackson on the court, given the casting vote of the vice-president, Kamala Harris. Joe Manchin, a centrist Democrat from West Virginia, had already confirmed his support. But the vice-president’s tie-breaking vote has never been required to confirm a supreme court justice, making Collins’ vote at least symbolically important. Collins’ support also comes at a time of bitter partisan divide that was underscored by hostile and politically loaded questioning of Jackson led by white, hard-line Republicanmen, prominently including Tom Cotton, Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley. Ahead of a confirmation vote next week, other Republican moderates could follow Collins and announce support for Jackson. In particular, Mitt Romney of Utah, the 2012 Republican nominee for president, has said he has not yet decided. Jackson will replace Stephen Breyer when he retires this summer. As Breyer is a member of the outmatched liberal group on the court, his replacement will not alter the 6-3 conservative majority. Republicans including the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, have complained that Jackson would not take a position on calls from progressives to expand the court in order to redress its ideological balance, duringher judiciary committee confirmation hearing last week. Speaking to the Times, Collins said: “In recent years, senators on both sides of the aisle have gotten away from what I perceive to be the appropriate process for evaluating judicial nominees. “In my view, the role under the constitution assigned to the Senate is to look at the credentials, experience and qualifications of the nominee. It is not to assess whether a nominee reflects the individual ideology of a senator or would vote exactly as an individual senator would want.” Supreme court confirmations have become highly political and increasingly rancorous. In 2016, as Senate majority leader, McConnell refused even a hearing for Barack Obama’s final nominee, Merrick Garland, thereby holding a seat open to be filled by what he hoped would be a Republican president in 2016, which came to pass. Collins duly voted to confirm Donald Trump’s first nominee, Neil Gorsuch, the beneficiary of such hardball tactics. Collins also voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh, Trump’s second nominee, who vehemently denied accusations of sexual assault. But Collins voted not to confirm Amy Coney Barrett, a hardline conservative confirmed shortly before the 2020 presidential election in place of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liberal lion, in stark contravention of supposed principles about confirmations close to elections laid out by McConnell four years before. During the Democratic primary in 2020, Joe Biden promised to put a Black woman on the supreme court. Some Republicans voiced opposition to such a promise, disregarding precedent including Trump’s vow to name a woman to replace Ginsburg. In 2021, Collins was one of three Republicans who voted to confirm Jackson to a federal appeals court. The other two were Lindsey Graham of South Carolina – a hostile questioner in Jackson’s supreme court hearings – and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Murkowski has not said which way she will vote this time. Explaining her vote to the Times, Collins cited Jackson’s “breadth of experience as a law clerk, attorney in private practice, federal public defender, member of the US Sentencing Commission and district court judge for more than eight years”. In a tweet, the White House chief of staff, Ron Klain, said: “Grateful to Senator Collins for giving fair, thoughtful consideration to Judge Jackson – and all of the president’s judicial nominations.”",News/US news,Ketanji Brown Jackson to receive rare Republican vote as Collins says yes,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/30/ketanji-brown-jackson-susan-collins-supreme-court
3/31/2022,"Auditors have warned about the financial health of the company behind the Stanlow oil refinery, despite its efforts to refinance loans and settle a debt to HM Revenue & Customs. Documents filed at Companies House show that losses at Essar Oil (UK) deepened from $221m (£168m) to $321m in 2021, a year in which government officials became concerned about the financial position of the company, which supplies 16% of UK road fuel from its refinery in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire. The group reported progress in refinancing its debts, replacing a loan from Lloyds Bank with $325m of new lending. Essar’s subsidiary, Stanlow Terminals Ltd, is working on a deal to raise up to $300m of debt and the group said it could also tap other sources of medium-term lending. Essar Oil has also reduced the amount it owed to HMRC, after it took part in a scheme that allow companies hit by Covid-19 to defer VAT repayments. At one stage in March 2021, Essar owed £771m to HMRC but it said this had since been reduced £109m and was due to be settled completely this month. But an auditor’s report warned of uncertainty over the company’s discussions about new loans to help it weather the impact of Covid-19, which significantly reduced demand for fuel before a recent revival in conditions. The report said that while financing proposals were under discussion, to mitigate the risk of the company defaulting on payments, the talks had not concluded. This, the auditor said, “may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern”. The accounts were signed off before the invasion of Ukraine and do not make any reference to the possible impact of the war on the company or its ties to Russia. Essar, which is ultimately owned by the Indian billionaire Ruia brothers, has previously distanced itself from its parent company’s lending arrangement with the Russian bank VTB. Earlier this year, dockers refused to unload Russian oil shipments destined for the refinery. Stanlow later said it was seeking alternative supplies. The company’s accounts do refer to its contract with Litasco, a Switzerland-based commodity trading company ultimately owned by the Kremlin-linked oil firm Lukoil. As the Guardian reported earlier this year, Litasco has a claim on Stanlow that kicks in if Essar defaults on payments under an oil sale and purchase agreement. Essar has said that Litasco has no ability to influence operations at the terminal.",News/Business,Auditors warn about finances of firm behind Stanlow oil refinery,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/30/auditors-warn-about-finances-of-firm-behind-stanlow-oil-refinery
3/31/2022,"Confronted last November with allegations of illegal, lockdown-breaking parties in Downing Street, Boris Johnson told MPs in the House of Commons that throughout the pandemic “all guidance was followed completely in No 10”. On Tuesday, having investigated evidence relating to 12 separate Downing Street events in 2020 and 2021, the Metropolitan police announced a first tranche of 20 fixed penalties for breaking lockdown rules at the very heart of government. More will follow, and the prime minister himself may be among those referred to the criminal records office for ignoring the laws he set and expected the rest of the country to follow. Two months ago, when Mr Johnson was feeling the heat from Partygate and knew his premiership was under threat, this shaming development would have prompted the prime minister to resort to practised combinations of faux-contrition, self-exculpatory claims and sophistry: he didn’t know there were parties; he wasn’t at that party; he was at the party but didn’t realise it was a party; he was very sorry. But that was then. At Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions, Mr Johnson exuded a blithe ebullience while brazenly ignoring the substance of Sir Keir Starmer’s interrogation on why he originally misled MPs. On Tuesday evening, hosting a “team-building” dinner for ministers and Conservative MPs, he even risked a wisecrack at the expense of Tory MPs who had sent letters of no confidence in him to the 1922 Committee. Mr Johnson’s audience laughed along as he described the rebels, a few of whom were present, as “some of the greatest epistolary letter-writers since St Paul”. Such general joviality would have been inconceivable only a few weeks ago. But the gravity of the Ukraine crisis, Downing Street clearly judges, has led the public and the Conservative party to move on. The prime minister seems to believe he is almost out of the woods. Thankfully, given the egregious and unforgivable breach of public trust that the Partygate scandal represents, there are grounds for thinking such confidence is misplaced. As more fines are issued by the Met, pressure will rightly mount for names, particularly senior ones, to be made public. The release of the full Sue Gray report into lockdown parties – postponed until the Met investigation is completed – will provide the damning detail behind her interim finding of “failures of leadership and judgment” in No 10. A rotten culture, presided over by the prime minister, will be properly exposed to the light. If Mr Johnson is issued with a fixed-penalty notice by the Met, a symbolic threshold will have been crossed; Conservative MPs’ inboxes will once again be inundated with angry instructions from Tory-voting constituents. The intensity of January – when the prime minister teetered on the brink – will surely return. Mr Johnson may prove capable of brazening out even this denouement: bold shamelessness is his political modus operandi, and it has served him well. But the Tory party should reflect on the fact that if he does survive to fight the next election, he will go into it as badly damaged goods. Pollsters report that on the doorstep the Partygate verdict is in: the prime minister betrayed the public’s trust during a national emergency, treated the Covid rules he set as optional for his own gilded circle, and then lied about what happened. This will be Labour’s relentless line of attack; it will resonate in the context of a looming economic crisis that a privately wealthy chancellor will do little to alleviate. One way or another, whether he remains in office or is prematurely forced to step down, a weakened Mr Johnson and a rudderless government will eventually pay a high price for Partygate.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Partygate: a reckoning approaches | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/30/the-guardian-view-on-partygate-a-reckoning-approaches
3/31/2022,"Last week an artificial intelligence – called NooK – beat eight world champion players at bridge. That algorithms can outwit humans might not seem newsworthy. IBM’s Deep Blue beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997. In 2016, Google’s AlphaGo defeated a Go grandmaster. A year later the AI Libratus saw off four poker stars. Yet the real-world applications of such technologies have been limited. Stephen Muggleton, a computer scientist, suggests this is because they are “black boxes” that can learn better than people but cannot express, and communicate, that learning. NooK, from French startup NukkAI, is different. It won by formulating rules, not just brute-force calculation. Bridge is not the same as chess or Go, which are two-player games based on an entirely known set of facts. Bridge is a game for four players split into two teams, involving collaboration and competition with incomplete information. Each player sees only their cards and needs to gather information about the other players’ hands. Unlike poker, which also involves hidden information and bluffing, in bridge a player must disclose to their opponents the information they are passing to their partner. This feature of bridge meant NooK could explain how its playing decisions were made, and why it represents a leap forward for AI. When confronted with a new game, humans tend to learn the rules and then learn to improve by, for example, reading books. By contrast, “black box” AIs train themselves by deep learning: playing a game billions of times until the algorithm has worked out how to win. It is a mystery how this software comes to its conclusions – or how it will fail. NooK nods to the work of British AI pioneer Donald Michie, who reasoned that AI’s highest state would be to develop new insights and teach these to humans, whose performance would be consequently increased to a level beyond that of a human studying by themselves. Michie considered “weak” machine learning to be just improving AI performance by increasing the amount of data ingested. His insight has been vindicated as deep learning’s limits have been exposed. Self-driving cars remain a distant dream. Radiologists were not replaced by AI last year, as had been predicted. Humans, unlike computers, often make short work of complicated, high-stake tasks. Thankfully, human society is not under constant diagnostic surveillance. But this often means not enough data for AI is available, and frequently it contains hidden, socially unacceptable biases. The environmental impact is also a growing concern, with computing projected to account for 20% of global electricity demand by 2030. Technologies build trust if they are understandable. There’s always a danger that black box AI solves a problem in the wrong way. And the more powerful a deep-learning system becomes, the more opaque it can become. The House of Lords justice committee this week said such technologies have serious implications for human rights and warned against convictions and imprisonment on the basis of AI that could not be understood or challenged. NooK will be a world-changing technology if it lives up to the promise of solving complex problems and explaining how it does so.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on bridging human and machine learning: it’s all in the game | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/30/the-guardian-view-on-bridging-human-and-machine-learning-its-all-in-the-game
3/31/2022,"Grant Shapps sounded terribly pleased with his nine-point response to the P&O Ferries debacle, but it is hard to see how any of the transport secretary’s measures will force the company to reinstate the 800 workers it sacked without consultation a fortnight ago, which seemed the government’s aim only a few days ago. The toughest new policy will create powers to block ferries with crews paid less than the minimum wage from British ports. The Harbours Act of 1965 will be revised via primary legislation; until then, port operators will be told to refuse access to non-compliant ferries. Fine, that reform will close a minimum wage loophole – or, rather, a door that the government deliberately left open for ferry firms when it altered rules covering other seafarers in 2020, Tim Tyndall, employment partner at Keystone Law, told this paper this week. But P&O Ferries will probably regard the change as perfectly acceptable from its point of view. The company, it seems, cannot be compelled to reinstate anybody on old rates – ones that worked out at £36,000 on average under a Jersey-based contract, according to chief executive Peter Hebblethwaite. In the meantime, P&O Ferries’ competitors, the under-cutters he grumbled about, will have to fall into line with enforcement of minimum wages. So P&O Ferries won’t be able to pay its irregular crew of agency staff £5.50 an hour average, which was its plan A, but it may get the “level playing field” it said it sought. In the meantime, DP World, the parent company that blessed the law-breaking sackings and is the power behind the ferries, probably now has fewer reasons to fear being thrown off the UK’s freeport programme, where its big assets are ports in the Thames and Solent. Shapps said the Dubai-backed firm was “very welcome to invest in this country” but should understand that “we take employment law seriously” and it needed “to deal with this P&O situation”. It wasn’t clear what “dealing with” meant, but DP could try sacking the arrogant Hebblethwaite, who, viewed from Dubai, has probably now served his purpose as a lightning rod for public anger. He looks expendable, even before the Insolvency Service has had a chance to consider his suitability to serve as a company director. Shapps would get a scalp and DP would hope to suffer no collateral damage for its role in this shameful saga. P&O Ferries’ former employees still wouldn’t get their jobs back, however. Education publisher Pearson has disappointed its shareholders, on and off, for about 20 years. Andy Bird, a digital-savvy boss on a (potentially) bountiful bonus deal, was meant to change all that, but the ex-Disney executive hasn’t worked much magic on the share price during his 18 months in charge. A trading update in October sent the stock down 12% a day; the pace of revival in the US has appeared pedestrian so far, just as it has always been. So, you might assume, Pearson would be a sitting duck if a large US private equity predator showed up. But, no, the plot has not worked out that way. Would-be bidder Apollo walked away on Wednesday after its third shot – 884p-a-share, or £7.2bn including debt – was dismissed by Pearson’s board as a “significant undervaluation” of the company and its prospects. And, actually, the undervaluation line is fair. Expectations for takeover bids have risen. Supermarket chain Morrisons (where Apollo dropped out of the running at early stage) was carted off at 60% premium to its pre-action share price last year, so 40%-ish for Pearson, a business with more turnaround potential, wasn’t obviously compelling. It also felt too soon to give up on Bird’s plan to get Pearson airborne. A three-year crack at the job seems only fair: there may be more operational progress than it seems from outside. The other conclusion, possibly, is that the UK takeover game has become slightly less loaded in favour of private equity raiders. The cost of borrowing has nudged higher in the past year, which makes it trickier to stretch borrowing ratios. Apollo, having bought and sold Pearson rival McGraw Hill a few years ago, arrived with expertise in the US textbook market, but ultimately wasn’t able, or wasn’t willing, to go high enough to force Pearson’s board to enter negotiations. The picture could change again in the buyout barons’ next big adventure, but the lack of drama on this occasion is welcome.

3/31/2022,"Boris Johnson promised to examine a proposal to increase universal credit in line with inflation, as he was grilled by a high-powered committee of MPs over the cost of living crisis. Questioning the prime minister as part of the liaison committee, Mel Stride MP highlighted the plight of those people dependent on universal credit, calling it a “hole”, in Rishi Sunak’s spring statement last week. “Those people are going to really suffer,” said Stride, a Conservative former treasury minister who now chairs the Treasury select committee. The liaison committee is made up of the chairs of the various House of Commons select committees, and the prime minister traditionally appears three times a year. Stride suggested increasing universal credit in line with current inflation rates – instead of the 3.1% uprating due in April – would ultimately cost the treasury no more money, as it would mean a smaller increase next year. “It would be fiscally neutral to reexamine and re-index those benefits say in a couple of months time,” he said. Johnson told him, “I’m going to have to go and look at how you’d do it in a fiscally neutral way: but what we want to do is to look after people in the aftershocks of the pandemic as much as we have during the pandemic, and the aftershocks are proving to be really quite challenging”. Sunak’s spring statement included a 5p cut in fuel duty and a significant increase in the national insurance threshold; but was widely criticised for failing to do enough to help those people struggling most with the cost of living. Johnson himself said the next day the government needs “to do more”. Labour MP Stephen Timms pressed Johnson on the plight of the unemployed. He responded by repeatedly stressing the importance of getting more people into jobs. “We want to support people into work wherever possible. We think that the way out of poverty is to help people into work, and all the evidence is that that works,” he said. The hearing also covered Ukraine, with Johnson defending the government’s refugee schemes. He described the 25,000 visas granted so far in total as “not a bad number so far”, adding, “they’re being handled at a rate of a thousand a day. The numbers will mount now quickly”. Asked if the scheme was too bureaucratic, he said, “what I wanted was a system that was as light touch as possible, and would enable people to come here but would enable us also to do checks”. The prime minister said he believes western countries should continue to ratchet up sanctions against Russia, until troops are withdrawn. “I certainly don’t think that you could expect the G7 to lift sanctions just because there’s a ceasefire: that goes straight into Putin’s playbook. In my view, we should continue to intensify sanctions with a rolling programme until every single one of his troops is out of Ukraine,” he said. The prime minister also appeared to question the French president’s decision to maintain close contacts with Vladimir Putin. Asked whether Emmanuel Macron’s was the right approach, Johnson said, “I think it’s very, very important that the unity of the west and the unity of Nato should be remembered and prioritised, and that’s what we’re doing.” He added, “the question of negotiation with Vladimir Putin, of the value of those negs, is an open one: my own view is that Putin is plainly not to be trusted.” The committee’s usual chair, Bernard Jenkin, was unable to attend Wednesday’s hearing as he is self-isolating with Covid.",News/Politics,PM promises to examine raising universal credit in line with inflation,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/30/boris-johnson-promises-to-examine-raising-universal-credit-in-line-with-inflation

So much has changed in that time, from a black, all-male company inspired by jazz and soul and the dance they learned together at middle school, to a multicultural, international troupe of male and female dancers. There have been multiple directors and shifts in tone, and more than once the company has seemingly risen from the ashes. There’s nothing from the earliest years in this programme curated by the current director, Dane Hurst; the focus is on the 90s and 00s. We get the composure and controlled angles of Henri Oguike’s Signal, and intertwining family relationships and split leaps from the sofa in Danial Shapiro and Joanie Smith’s Family. Jane Dudley’s Harmonica Breakdown is a three-minute gem, originally created in 1938 (mounted by Phoenix in 2008), a brief but heavy howl of a woman challenged by circumstance: proud, pained, determined, Yuma Sylla dancing with great purpose. The second half of the show is strongest, with two theatrical pieces that connect more directly with the audience. In Ben Duke and Raquel Meseguer’s Pave Up Paradise the equation is man plus woman plus booze, which equals drunken contrition and tension that turns to tired tenderness. It feels very human. Darshan Singh Bhuller led Phoenix during a successful period from 2002 to 2006. His piece Heart of Chaos is based on African American boxer Jack Johnson (Aaron Chaplin), the world heavyweight champion, beating James J Jeffries (Matthew Topliss), to the consternation of white America, in 1910. In this moody biography Johnson spends as much time on seduction as sport – he KOs a few beautiful flappers and has a more complex relationship with Melina Sofocleous as his wife – but Singh Bhuller creates effective action in the ring, especially when Chaplin and Topliss branch off into solos, really fighting battles with themselves. There’s strength and complexity in Chaplin’s portrayal – it’s not a straightforward victory for Johnson – and it’s good to be reminded of this rich, well-danced work. Here’s to 40 more years. At the Peacock theatre, London, until 30 March then touring.",Arts/Stage,Phoenix Dance Theatre review – tender and tense performances mark 40 years,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/30/phoenix-dance-theatre-review-peacock-theatre-london
3/31/2022,"Staff and crew who work on yachts or planes owned by Russian oligarchs could face UK sanctions under a move by the Foreign Office to extend the penalties. The aim is to make it harder for yachts to be maintained by crew, sometimes indirectly owned by oligarchs, and covers anyone providing technical assistance and maintenance of a yacht or plane. It will also restrict the ability of oligarchs to find staff willing to sail or fly their assets out of the UK jurisdiction. Two superyachts linked to the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich have docked in Turkey, beyond the reach of UK and EU sanctions. But if it could be proven that UK firms were providing assistance to the yachts, they could be punished through sanctions. UK officials note that in Italy, the crew of suspect yachts have either been changed or refused to cooperate with police over revealing the identity of the vessel’s ultimate owner. The Italian police have been investigating Scheherazade, one of the world’s largest superyachts currently in a Tuscan luxury resort which some believe is owned by Vladimir Putin. The Foreign Office has also said sanctions are being extended to cover illegal activity not just in Crimea but in the Russian-controlled territories of Donetsk and Luhansk. The legislation takes the form of a statutory instrument – a form of legislation that has to be debated by MPs but quickly becomes law. The UK government seized its first superyacht in British waters earlier this week, adding to a tally of seven in Europe. The £38m yacht, named Phi, is owned by a Russian businessman, understood not to be an individual facing sanctions. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the individual was not currently under sanctions but had “close connections” to Putin. The nearly 60-metre long Phi was first identified as being potentially Russian-owned on 13 March but its ownership is “deliberately well hidden”, the government said. It added that the company the ship is registered to is based in the Caribbean islands of Saint Kitts and Nevis but it carried Maltese flags to hide its origins. Many yachts remain at large – some are on the move, others are moored in places that are currently sheltered from sanctions, including the Maldives. Many superyachts are linked to Russian billionaires but their ownership is shrouded in secrecy. Boats are often registered through a series of offshore companies including in the UK overseas territories. Although seizing yachts is an attention-grabbing way of demonstrating political willingness to go after Putin’s revenue streams, most Whitehall officials believe issues such as energy import bans from Russia are far more important.It has also emerged at least eight Russian oligarchs on the UK sanctions list over their links to Vladimir Putin were granted “golden visas” to live in Britain. The government also confirmed it was cutting off two Russia oligarchs under sanctions, Eugene Shvidler and Oleg Tinkov, from their jets. Shvidler is a close business partner of Abramovich with a fortune valued at $1.6bn by Forbes magazine. He has had his two private jets based at Farnborough airport already seized by the UK. Tinkov, a billionaire banker, is also said to have jets deregistered by the Isle of Man in a pre-emptive move, but they are now seized. The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said: “There is no doubt that Putin and his elite have been surprised by the strength of our sanctions. “We will continue to ramp up the pressure so long as Russian troops are in Ukraine, targeting not only the businesses of oligarchs but also their assets and international lifestyles.”",News/Politics,Staff who work on yachts and planes of Russian oligarchs could face UK sanctions,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/30/staff-who-work-on-yachts-and-planes-of-russian-oligarchs-could-face-uk-sanctions
3/31/2022,"Police have released a video showing two off-duty officers armed only with a piece of wood and golf clubs tackling a man who stabbed one neighbour and badly injured a second after a bitter long-running dispute. Can Arslan, 52, killed Matthew Boorman, his neighbour in the village of Walton Cardiff in Gloucestershire, stabbing him 27 times, and inflicted eight knife wounds on another neighbour, Peter Marsden. There is no dispute that Arslan killed Boorman, a 43-year-old contract manager and father of three, but the jury has been told it must decide if it was murder or manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. He has also admitted attempting to murder Marsden. The video shows Arslan, smoking and barefooted, the knife in his right hand, forcing his way into Marsden’s property on 5 October last year, by which time he has already attacked Boorman. Steve Wilkinson, an off-duty police sergeant who is armed with a piece of wood, tells Arslan: “Put the fucking knife down,” and hits the attacker with the wood. Wilkinson is joined by a second off-duty officer, PC Josh Norris, and both brandish golf clubs as they try to get Arslan to drop the knife. The jury at Bristol crown court heard on Wednesday that Marsden told police he was making dinner when Arslan stormed into his kitchen. He said: “His eyes I remember were really evil. I instantly dropped what I was doing and ran towards him shouting: ‘Get out, get out.’ At the time I did not know he had a knife on him.” He managed to force Arslan out. “I was bleeding quite heavily – I laid down on the floor and a neighbour came in and the nurse from up the road just started to put pressure on to stem the bleeding. “This is something I had been expecting from Mr Arslan. He has threatened to kill me previously. Because of his threats I have spent thousands of pounds on security.” The court heard that when he was arrested, Arslan told police: “I was a sniper in the army … I killed 50 people in the Kurdish army.” PC Gregory Jones, who spoke to Arslan the night before the attacks, told the court the defendant told him: “I am a hitman – you will see.” The officer entered the threat into a computer system, and it went live less than two hours before Arslan struck.",News/UK news,Video shows police tackling man who killed neighbour in Gloucestershire,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/30/video-shows-police-tackling-man-who-killed-neighbour-in-gloucestershire
3/31/2022,"The most distant star ever seen has been captured by the Hubble space telescope in images that appear to give a remarkable glimpse into the ancient universe. Light from the star, named Earendel, has travelled an estimated 12.9bn years to reach the Earth – a huge leap from the previous most distant star, which dates to nine billion years. The observations were possible thanks to a rare cosmic alignment, meaning that Earendel may be the only individual star from this epoch that we will ever see. “We almost didn’t believe it at first, it was so much farther than the previous most distant star,” said Brian Welch, an astronomy PhD student from Johns Hopkins University and lead author of the paper. “Studying Earendel will be a window into an era of the universe that we are unfamiliar with, but that led to everything we know.” Prof Colin Norman, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University, who was not involved in the findings, said: “This is a remarkable pioneering discovery that opens up a completely new region of discovery and enables massive stars to be directly observed when the universe was young and star formation was recently initiated.” Scientists estimate that Earendel, whose name means “morning star” in Old English, is at least 50 times the mass of the Sun and millions of times as bright, placing it among the most massive stars known. But even such a brilliant star would not normally be detectable. At such vast distances, even an entire galaxy is just a smudge of light. It was only thanks to natural magnification by a huge galaxy cluster, WHL0137-08, which sits between us and Earendel, that astronomers were able to make the detection. The cluster’s gravitational pull is so intense that light bends around it, creating a powerful cosmic magnifying glass that amplifies light from distant objects lying behind it. Scientists calculate that Earendel’s brightness is magnified by a factor of thousands – a situation that may not be repeated with other ancient stars within our lifetimes. “This might be the earliest star we will ever see since the big bang,” said Dr Guillaume Mahler, an astronomer at Durham University and co-author. The star’s distance was estimated by its colour. Light is “red-shifted” away from its original wavelength as it travels through the expanding universe and so, although Earendel would have been blue if seen from nearby, 12.9bn years ago, it appears a deep red in the Hubble images. The observations have been hailed as hugely significant and been prioritised for the first cycle of observations using Nasa’s James Webb Space Telescope, due to begin in June. This will allow scientists to definitively confirm that they are looking at a single, very distant star. An alternative possibility, deemed very unlikely, is that it is a dim, nearby brown dwarf. The planned observations will also allow astronomers to measure the star’s brightness and temperature and give insights into the composition of the earliest generation of stars. These stars – the ancestors of those we see in the sky today – formed before the universe was filled with the heavy elements produced by successive generations of massive stars. There are theoretical predictions, but no direct evidence, of an early generation of stars made only of primordial hydrogen and helium. “[These stars] produce the first supernovae that enrich the galaxies with metals and elements such as carbon and oxygen that are necessary for life,” said Norman. “These stars are also responsible for injecting energy into the turbulent medium from which stars and galaxies are forming.” The findings are published in the journal Nature.",News/Science,Distant star found by Hubble telescope may be earliest we will ever see,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/30/hubble-space-telescope-captures-distant-star-earendel
