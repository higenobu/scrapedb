3/14/2022,"For Nothing Tender About It If as shame is to memory, so too desire,then is this desire, this cloak of shadows,that I wrap close around me, that Irefuse to take off? But the lake looks endless.And my boat’s increasingly but a slowish swimmer,across the waves – I’ve knownhurt, I mean; and I have been afraid. Sometimes the difference between forgettingto bring along artillery and showing upon purpose to the war unarmed is just that: a difference. Sometimes a lost tune,unreckoned on, unearned, resurfaces anyway. Just because. Am I not the animal by belief alone I myself make possible? This week’s poem is by Carl Phillips, and is included in Then the War and Selected Poems 2007-2020, a welcome collection of earlier and new work by an unusually far-reaching poetic explorer. An interview with the Kenyon Review provides illuminating context, plus biography. For Nothing Tender About It, a sonnet-like lyric, appears on the page after the title-poem of its collection, Pale Colors in a Tall Field. The latter interrogates remembered love and memory itself in a life “where there’s so much I’d rather not remember that / to be asked to do so can seem a cruelty”. The contrast of love perceived as “rescue” and as something “more gladiatorial” seems to linger in the turns of the sonnet, and underlines the ambiguity of the title. This week’s poem opens with an extended question that immediately sets the reader asking themselves what “shame is to memory”. Shame is entwined with memory in that a particular memory recalls and recreates – even physically, perhaps – the sensation of shame. An experience that prompts shame can deepen and fix its memorability, and, of course, also ensure therapeutic forgetting. Remembered desire can have both these effects. Yet if it’s analogous with a closely wrapped “cloak of shadows”, remembered desire may be comforting and protective (tender, in fact) – the opposite of shame. The first quatrain resembles that cloak of shadows in its compactness. Subsequently, the thought moves from seductive brain-tease – chiefly, though not entirely, abstract – to allegory. The pattern of shorter and longer lines increases the sense of simultaneous disturbance and capacity in the second quatrain. The lake simply “looks endless”, but the boat is tellingly described as “increasingly but a slow swimmer”, the quaintness of the “but” enhancing the leisured but slightly laborious pace of the metaphorical oars. The voyage seems to be into memory seen as an endless stretch of water, since, after the third line caesura, dawn the veiled discoveries: “I’ve known / hurt, I mean; and I have been afraid.” Breaking the line and heralding the new stanza with “Sometimes” effectively sustains continuity and frames what’s almost an aphorism (although a carefully protracted one): “Sometimes // the difference between forgetting / to bring along artillery and showing up / on purpose to the war unarmed // is just that: a difference.” This is compelling and the reader may want to agree with it wholeheartedly before working out that it’s presenting a challenge to the slickness of proverb-like reasoning. To forget the artillery may not be the result of a subconscious intention to be vulnerable and “unarmed”. It might be a careless mistake. While in the first line of the couplet, the “Sometimes” that’s placed after the caesura suggests an echo with the previous “Sometimes” it’s not immediately clear how the unexpectedly remembered “lost tune” is related to the forgotten artillery. The connection, I think, is the randomness shared by both remembering and forgetting, but also the antithesis between the tender and the gladiatorial. Phillips’s unsentimental, even throwaway, treatment of the emotive issues of memory is bracing, and, like the structure, a challenge to sonnet tradition. An extra challenge comes in the shape of the extended, Latinate, leisurely final question, which asks if the solid identity of the “animal” isn’t created and held together by its own act of faith. A concept associated with Schopenhauer, perhaps? Posters who are better philosophers than me will have more to say about the origins of the idea. In the context of the poem, it returns my thought to that “slowish swimmer” of a boat, and the constant rhythmic strokes which keep the body of thought moving forwards and defying gravity.",Arts/Books,Poem of the week: For Nothing Tender About It by Carl Phillips,https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2022/mar/14/poem-of-the-week-for-nothing-tender-about-it-by-carl-phillips
3/14/2022,"Conservative influence powerhouse CPAC and the American Conservative Union that sponsors it, face criticism on multiple fronts over financial and other dealings with foreign backers, and charges their gatherings have become pay-to-play affairs with corporate lobbyists as Donald Trump allies gain power and influence. The Conservative Political Action Conference’s annual meeting is a hugely influential date on the conservative calendar every year and attracts a wide array of power players in the Republican party and broader conservative movement. CPAC’s “straw poll” is seen as a potential predictor of Republican presidential candidates. Last month it was held in Florida where Trump was the star attraction, and won the straw poll by a healthy margin. The growing salvos aimed at CPAC and the ACU have come as the ACU has expanded fundraising operations and become closely linked to Trump and his large loyalist base, say current and former ACU board members. Critics say that in recent years a “pay to play” mentality has become pervasive at CPAC events under the leadership of veteran Washington lobbyist and staunch Trump backer Matt Schlapp, who chairs ACU and whose wife Mercedes worked in the Trump White House as director of strategic communications. The ACU board, which numbers about two dozen and tapped Schlapp to lead the group in 2014, has added some new fundraising muscle and corporate lobbyists including the top lobbyist for Comcast, a former client of Cove Strategies, Schlapp’s consulting and lobbying firm. Moreover, a current ACU board member and lobbying experts have raised red flags about CPAC helping host events overseas in Brazil, South Korea, Japan and elsewhere. Meanwhile, CPAC’s US meetings have accepted funding from some foreign entities that have pushed political lobbying messages, spurring questions about possible violations of a lobbying disclosure law known as the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). Some former and current ACU board members say recent changes have caused worry. “They have become just another Beltway organization, no longer the membership organization – with members across America, derived from direct mail and state-based chapters,” said publisher Jameson Campaigne, who served on the ACU board for about four decades until 2016 when he was replaced by business executive Carly Fiorina. A conservative activist and long time CPAC attendee voiced similar concerns and noted that the “pay-to-play” mentality of ACU and CPAC is evident at the annual meetings. “It is obvious from the agenda and the speakers who now dominate the events that it’s much more a pay to play conference than a conservative issue driven one,” he said Not surprisingly, the new modus operandi at CPAC in some ways mirrors the lobbying background of Schlapp, whose firm Cove Strategies thrived during the Trump years but took a hit last year after he left office. In 2020 Cove Strategies raked in almost $2.4m dollars – including $750,000 from a Georgia executive convicted of securities fraud who Schlapp tried but failed to obtain a Trump pardon for. But last year after Trump left office, Cove’s revenues plummeted to just under $400,000, according to OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan lobbying watchdog ACU veterans say its board has had a makeover in recent years under Schlapp. “Matt changed the board so it’s more business people and fundraisers who can help Matt,” said one ACU alumni. “It’s changed from a conservative conference to a Trump conference.” The ACU board now boasts some wealthy conservatives such as Bill Walton, the chairman of a private equity firm who also hosts an eponymous talk radio show which has become a staple at CPAC gatherings such as the recent one in Orlando. Walton served on a Treasury transition team for Trump before he took office. Other board members with Trump ties include KT McFarland, who served for a few months as deputy national security adviser at the start of his administration. Schlapp’s fundraising skills include a stint as the top lobbyist for oil giant Koch Industries and seem to have paid off for CPAC and ACU. A series of CPAC overseas gatherings along with more regional CPAC events in recent years in the US, have helped boost ACU revenues Overall revenues from CPAC events more than quadrupled from $735,000 in the period April 2020 to Jan 2021 to $3.4m from April 2021 to January 2022, according to an ACU board statement that a current board member shared with the Guardian Nonetheless, a current ACU board member voiced worries that key decisions about the overseas events that CPAC has helped arrange for the last few years are made without adequate board scrutiny. “The board has become more and more ceremonial,” the current board member said. “We don’t even vote to authorize international CPAC events. Because there are so many potential pitfalls to foreign engagement, including accepting foreign funds, these should be board level decisions.” Some overseas events such as one in Brazil in 2019 have raised eyebrows given the far right tendencies of some key attendees. Eduardo Bolsonaro, a Brazilian rightist politician and policeman who is the son of the country’s authoritarian president Jair Bolsonaro, has also attended a couple of CPAC’s annual events including the latest one in Orlando. But more ominously, a whistleblower complaint was filed last month stating that “there is sufficient evidence of alleged violations to support a federal criminal or civil investigation”. Specifically, the complaint names Schlapp, his wife Mercedes who has been a key figure at CPAC events, ACU, the ACU Foundation, and Schlapp’s lobbying and consulting firm Cove Strategies The complaint by the whistleblower, which was first reported by Huffington Post and confirmed by the Guardian, came shortly before the latest CPAC event last month where several foreign groups paid in total almost $200,000 to have exhibit space and other perks at the group’s Orlando meeting. Among the foreign groups that paid five figure sums to participate at the latest CPAC event were CPAC Korea, a conservative European think tank called New Direction, and CPAC Hungary which seems to have ties to the party of Hungary’s far right president Viktor Orban and is slated to help host an event in Budapest in May CPAC’s sponsorship rates suggest that CPAC Korea paid $75,000 and had an exhibit booth to advertise its messages Other benefits included a three minute video shown from CPAC’s main stage. A CPAC Korea video urged people to sign a petition opposing a House bill to encourage a peace treaty between South and North Korea. CPAC Korea also handed out literature and displayed signs that urged attendees to “End the #fakepeace on the Korean peninsula act – OPPOSE H.R. 3446.” Brett Kappel, a lawyer with Harmon Curran who has handled FARA work, told the Guardian that the activities of CPAC Korea in Orlando “definitely raises red flags about possible FARA violations by the foreign CPAC’s operations in the United States”. The justice department, he added, would want to know “if foreign governments or political parties are funding these groups, or if foreign governments or political parties are directing their lobbying activities.” Craig Holman, an ethics and lobbying expert, raised related concerns about CPAC allowing the foreign group to push its political message. “If CPAC is facilitating Korea’s interest in influencing public policy on American soil, then CPAC is serving as a foreign agent for Korea,” said Holman, a veteran lobbying expert with the liberal group Public Citizen. “CPAC Korea definitely should register,” Holman added. “ If CPAC Korea is run or accountable to CPAC generally, then CPAC should register.” Neither an ACU spokesperson or Schlapp responded to emails requesting comment about the whistleblower complaint, and possible FARA violations at its latest meeting by CPAC Korea. Some of the controversies now plaguing ACU and CPAC are not all that surprising. When Schlapp was elected chairman in 2014, ACU board member Ned Ryun told Politico he expected Schlapp to make fundraising a priority, and to make CPAC more of a “training ground for activists”, rather than a policy event dominated by big speeches. Still, for some former ACU board members the spate of controversial changes in recent years have sparked dismay. One ex-board member said an old quip by writer Eric Hoffer seemed apt. “Every great cause begins as a movement, becomes a business, and eventually degenerates into a racket.”",News/US news,Critics accuse CPAC of becoming pay-to-play as Trump loyalists gain power,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/14/cpac-pay-to-play-trump-loyalists-gain-power
3/14/2022,"It would happen when I least expected it. At the checkout at the supermarket, or sitting in the park. Suddenly, I would find myself back in my parents’ flat, watching in horror as my mum took her last ragged breaths. Years later, I could still recall every detail and the feeling of her frail hand growing colder in mine. Each time, it was like reliving her death all over again. Grief toppled me after my mum died of bile duct cancer in 2016. The chaotic jumble of emotions left me feeling numb and drained. I knew that shutting myself down and locking away my sadness deep inside me wasn’t the best way to cope, but I didn’t know what else to do. I tried counselling, read grief message boards late into the night, attended support groups. They helped in small ways, but they did nothing to lighten the suffocating weight of my loss. Then, one day, I found myself in a community centre in King’s Cross, London, talking to a group of strangers. I had signed up to a 10-week grief workshop, which was almost over. On the board was a crude drawing of a brain with lots of little cameras surrounding it. This is how flashbacks are produced when something traumatic is happening, explained Dr Erin Hope Thompson, a clinical psychologist and the founder of the Loss Foundation. Our brains try to record everything. That is why, when painful memories drift back, they remain so raw and vivid. “The brain changes quite dramatically when we’re in a traumatic moment,” Thompson says now. “It goes back to fight or flight. The part of the brain that is trying to capture what happens – the limbic system – goes into overdrive. Blood flow increases to this area.” Like the camera in her metaphor, it starts taking lots of snapshots. “It’s trying to capture as much as possible to keep us safe, so that, if we were in the same situation again, we’d know what to do.” At the same time, the blood that flows to the part of the brain that stores these memories and puts a “time stamp” on them decreases, she says. “These traumatic memories haven’t been processed in the normal way. They’re kind of floating around. A flashback is our brain trying to process what happened.” Most people know about the five stages of grief – denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance – popularised by the psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, but there is much less talk about flashbacks and the role they play in helping us move through pain. They are most often described as a symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder. But sitting there, listening to Thompson describe how the brain produces them, something clicked. Flashbacks are a common experience for many people who are grieving. A 2012 study found that 69% of people experienced them in the lead-up to the anniversary of the death of a loved one. “We often retain those memories very strongly because they’ve got a lot of emotion around them,” says Andy Langford, a counsellor and the clinical director at the bereavement charity Cruse. “It’s not just an intellectual memory that we can think of and then dismiss. It’s something that’s really highly charged. They can involve any of the senses. They can be visual, but they can also involve smell, or hearing someone’s voice, or the sounds of when they died, like the rattle in the throat.” While my head was stuck on the last moments of her life, I hardly ever dreamed of my mum. When I did, she always appeared as she looked in her final months – sick and emaciated, not healthy and happy, as I had known her for most of my life. Clearly, my subconscious was a mess. So I felt relieved to hear a logical explanation for my inability to get past that moment. It wasn’t just that my heart was hurting, but that my brain wouldn’t let me move on. Before then, I had understood a lot of things about grief – that it would leave me shipwrecked in anguish and that I wouldn’t be the same again – but it was only when I learned about flashbacks that I acknowledged that what I had been through was truly traumatic. My mum was sick for two years – a long time for the aggressive type of cancer she had. Watching her waste away slowly was agonising. In the last few months of her life, we were twice told prematurely that she had only a few days left and to say our goodbyes. Each time, she struggled on and defied the doctors’ expectations. Eventually, her body just couldn’t do it any more. Linda Fairweather, 58, attended the Loss Foundation workshop after her husband of 31 years, Keith, died of throat cancer. She was struggling to cope with the painful memories. “I felt like I was going a little bit mad, because I used to suddenly go to a place and couldn’t pull myself back,” she says. “With the flashbacks, you get the images, the smells, everything. I would have moments where I would just flash back to certain parts of it. I could be really happy and feel like myself. And it would just drag me back down again.” Since she learned how flashbacks work, hers have dissipated, although they haven’t stopped entirely. “They really upset me,” she says. “But I feel like I’ve got the tools to deal with them. I know what’s happening and what to do with it. I know they’ll pass. I try to give myself time.” If you are experiencing flashbacks after the death of a loved one and it gets too much for you, you don’t need to sign up to a grief workshop. Langford recommends talking to a friend or a counsellor, or observing rituals that you did together, such as going for a walk to their favourite spot. “Those things are really helpful, because they can act as a reminder of what was good with the individual’s life.” For people who are really struggling, eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) is one of the treatments offered by the NHS. Langford says EMDR “can help stimulate the brain’s processing of the incident, which can then lessen how raw the emotions are”. It involves recalling the traumatic memory while a therapist directs you to move your eyes from side to side, or taps your hand. On my way home after that workshop session, various difficult memories I hadn’t thought about for a long time suddenly resurfaced, as if my brain had been given permission to open the floodgates. I cried hard that night. But since then I have stopped being haunted by my mum’s final moments. Not that grief ever ends. You learn to exist with it. There is a stone in your heart. Sometimes, it is big; it rubs and makes you bleed. Sometimes, it is small and you can almost forget it is there. I still think about that time, but the power has been taken away. My memories are no longer as visceral; I can look back with a sense of detachment. Now, I can focus on remembering my mum as she really was – a wonderful and caring person with a sweet smile, who loved her children more than anything.",Lifestyle/Life and style,I kept reliving the moment my mother died.

3/14/2022,"It looks as if the universe was designed by a Romantic painter. Great glowing clouds of smoke and mist hang in the void with twinkling stars spangled within them. Instead of lonely bright dots in black nothingness, as space used to be pictured, it turns out to be a sublime storm of dazzling richness. The Pillars of Creation is the photo that made the Hubble telescope’s name. It shows a star-forming region of the Eagle nebula, 7,000 light years from Earth. In 2015 Nasa released a second, even more detailed and glorious Pillars of Creation). The successful launch of the new James Webb telescope has eclipsed Hubble, but as it “sees” in infrared, it is unlikely to provide similarly beguiling pictures. The Hubble Age is ending but it changed our cosmic perception for ever.

A delicate blend of strings and harp, it is part childlike Disney song, part space-folk odyssey, trembling and spiralling in directions you might not expect but always returning to home via Newsom’s inimitable, dexterous vocal. Her technical references to meteorites and meteoroids might be a little confused (very likely a deliberate plot device), but don’t let that put you off: this tale of siblings grown apart deploys evocative science metaphor much better than most. Jenessa Williams In Frederik Pohl’s Hugo and Nebula award-winning novel Gateway, humans use a strange alien technology to hurtle off into other galaxies. Some come back with untold riches. Some don’t come back at all. This intergalactic game of Russian roulette makes for a superb sci-fi premise, but there is far more to the book. Pohl creates a powerful sense of an incomprehensible multiverse – then measures humanity up against it. He makes us seem very small compared with the vast mystery of space, but he also shows how overwhelming and all-consuming emotions such as anger and regret remain. He demonstrates that there are also universes to explore within the human mind – and the cosmos feels even bigger as a result. Sam Jordison Space is big. Like, really, unnecessarily, I’ve-given-myself-a-hernia-just-thinking-about-it big. No game has nailed this existentially alarming sense of scale better than Hello Games’s constantly evolving astral voyage simulator No Man’s Sky. It’s just you, a spaceship, and a whole galaxy to explore. Through some daffy algorithmic magic, the game procedurally creates its worlds on the fly – a whopping 18 quintillion of them – meaning each place you visit is unlikely to be seen by anyone else for the rest of time. This same randomising tech witchcraft also sculpts each biome’s plants and animals, meaning each world is resplendent with weird, wonderful and utterly unique life. For sheer, slack-jawed cosmic scope, No Man’s Sky is unrivalled. Just point the nose of your ship at the heavens, pick a star, and off you go. Luke Holland The greatest movies about outer space (Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey, Tarkovsky’s Solaris) are also explorations of the space within. So while, galactically speaking, Duncan Jones’s Moon is set right next door on our very own friendly satellite, its themes of identity, humanity and the meaning of home are, well, universal. As the supposedly lone technician on a lunar base who discovers his wounded doppelganger in a wreck on the moon’s surface, Sam Rockwell gives a lovely rumpled performance: an everyman discovering he might not be anyman at all.

3/14/2022,"A major new Biden administration initiative to facilitate access to Covid-19 antivirals will have a limited impact and fail to mitigate certain health inequities, major pharmacist groups argue, because pharmacists are restricted from prescribing the pills. Announced in Joe Biden’s State of the Union address, the “Test to Treat” program is meant to address the maddening difficulty Americans have had in accessing Covid-19 treatments. The administration will channel newly increasing stocks of antiviral pills to major retail pharmacies that have in-house clinics, providing one-stop testing and antivirals access. The program, which the administration aims to provide for free (in the face of fierce Republican opposition to new Covid-19 spending), is also slated to roll out in Veterans Affairs clinics, community health centers and long-term care facilities. Major participants include some 250 Walgreens stores, 225 Kroger Little Clinics and 1,200 CVS MinuteClinics. CVS clinics in particular are staffed by nurse practitioners and physician assistants, authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to prescribe the two currently available Covid antivirals, Pfizer’s Paxlovid and Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics’ molnupiravir. In a 9 March letter to Biden calling for pharmacists to be granted authority to prescribe these pills, 14 organizations representing pharmacies and pharmacists insisted Test to Treat’s impact will be compromised by the fact that such in-house clinics are relatively limited in number and largely in urban areas. “Unfortunately, rural and underserved communities are less likely to benefit from your test to treat approach because of this limitation,” the letter states. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 90% of Americans live within five miles of one of approximately 60,000 pharmacies. “The FDA is still blocking us from leveraging the most accessible healthcare provider out there to make sure that these patients can get these drugs easily,” said Michael Ganio, a Columbus, Ohio pharmacist, senior director of pharmacy practice and quality at the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, which is a signatory of the letter to Biden. “As far as expanding access,” said Ganio, Test to Treat is “not doing a lot”. The need for Covid-19 antivirals is likely to be greater in rural areas, at least on a per capita basis. A recent CDC study found that through January, 58.5% of people aged five and older in rural counties had received at least one coronavirus vaccination shot, compared with 75.4% in urban counties. Paxlovid and molnupiravir are authorized for individuals at high risk of severe Covid-19, in particular unvaccinated people with certain medical conditions. Paxlovid was 88% effective at preventing hospitalization and death in its clinical trial. Molnupiravir proved just 30% effective. The FDA only authorizes its use when other treatments are unavailable or aren’t advised for an individual. Sufficient supply of Paxlovid will be key to Test to Treat. Since late December, the federal government has delivered a woefully inadequate 700,000 Paxlovid courses to states, the biweekly allotment increasing from 100,000 in January to 175,000 in March. The administration has claimed it will distribute 1m courses in March and 2.5m in April. A Pfizer representative would only state that the company plans to deliver a cumulative 10m courses by the end of June. The administration has agreed to purchase 20m courses, slated to be delivered by the end of September. In September 2021, the US Department of Health and Human Services amended a federal public health emergency law, the Prep Act, to grant licensed pharmacists the authority “to order and administer select Covid-19 therapeutics” – which at the time meant monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. But when the FDA authorized Paxlovid and molnupiravir in December, it explicitly restricted pharmacists from prescribing them. Authors of the letter to Biden say they submitted data to the FDA at the end of January, hoping to persuade it to grant pharmacists prescribing authority. These groups have also lobbied the federal government to ensure Medicare Part B would reimburse pharmacists for such prescribing – a move that would likely lead health insurers to follow. Prescribing Paxlovid safely can be challenging, because it may interact harmfully with other medications. Additionally, the FDA advises against providing the treatment to those with severe kidney or liver impairment. Experts have also raised concerns about molnupiravir’s potential toxicities. It cannot be prescribed to minors and is not advised for pregnant women. Chanapa Tantibanchachai, an FDA press officer, said the agency’s decision to forbid pharmacists from prescribing Paxlovid and molnupiravir “was based on several factors, including the drugs’ side effect profiles, the need to assess potential for drug interactions, the need to assess potential kidney function problems (including the severity of potential problems), and the need to evaluate patients for pre-existing conditions” linked to severe Covid-19. Tantibanchachai said the FDA could revise the policy “as new data and information become available”. On 4 March, the American Medical Association said the “pharmacy based clinic component of the Test to Treat plan flaunts patient safety and risks significant negative health outcomes”. The AMA argued that by prescribing Covid antivirals at such clinics, providers may endanger patients for whom they lack a comprehensive medical history. The pharmacy groups insisted in their letter to Biden they have the expertise to prescribe these medications. In an email to the Guardian, Al Carter, executive director of the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, stated: “Pharmacists have more complete access to the patients’ medication in comparison to physicians, especially since most patients have more than one prescriber, who don’t necessarily talk with each other. “Pharmacists spend their whole education focused on medications and their impacts on the body; whereas physicians take the minimal number of classes on pharmacology.” Katherine Yang, a clinical pharmacist at the University of California, San Francisco, said: “There are a lot of studies that show that when you increase services in community pharmacies, you improve care. In a lot of neighborhoods and rural areas, people may not have access to primary care, and pharmacists are the most accessible public health provider the patients can see.”",News/World news,Test to Treat: pharmacists say Biden’s major new Covid initiative won’t work,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/covid-biden-new-covid-initiative-wont-work-pharmacists
3/14/2022,"American railroad workers are criticizing a new restrictive attendance policy at one of the largest railroad freight networks in the US, as they experience grueling schedules and labor cuts in the midst of new union contract negotiations, which have hit an impasse, prompting federal mediation. The Guardian spoke with several railroad trainmen and engineers who requested to remain anonymous as they are prohibited by their employer from speaking to the media. On 1 February, BNSF Railway, one of the largest railroad freight networks in North America implemented a new point system attendance policy, criticized by workers and unions representing about 17,000 workers, for being more restrictive, incentivizing going to work fatigued or ill, and increasing threats of discipline. One train engineer in the network’s Great Plains Region claimed they had to push back a medical procedure for a chronic illness to the summer, when they have vacation time off scheduled, as they would have used nearly all of their attendance points required for the time off needed for the procedure. “We feel stabbed in the back, completely demoralized with the work we did through the pandemic, understanding the situation, going the extra mile, and doing what we’re asked to do, and then some without complaint,” said the worker. The new attendance system appears arcane. Workers are allotted 30 career attendance points and docked several points for taking any days off, with points varying on the time of the week and days designated as high-impact days. Workers can get four points back after working uninterrupted for 14 days. Previously, workers were allotted five weekdays off a month and two weekend days off. Workers are continuously on call and have just over an hour to report to work when they are called in. “Fatigue is a chronic issue with almost everyone I know and work with. We manage it so it doesn’t get too severe,” they added. “We’ve been struggling through the pandemic with fatigue, exhaustion, and we have no chance to even catch our breath.” Despite the grueling work schedules, workers explained there is no room for error in the work they do given the important safety components of their job, such as transporting hazardous chemicals. Workers are legally permitted to work a maximum of 12 hours operating a train, but the worker noted it often takes several additional hours for relief to arrive and to get to a hotel or terminal when away from home. While always on call, the work hours vary widely and often change on a moment’s notice, making it impossible for workers to adapt to healthy sleep schedules, having to piece together naps whenever possible while waiting to be called into work. Workers say that even though high-impact days, such as various holidays including Super Bowl Sunday, are designated as seven attendance points, workers are not paid any additional pay for working those days. “You don’t know when they’re calling and they can call you at any time,” a worker said. “We’re still going through the pandemic, whether folks like to believe that or not, or abide by what’s going on or not, even though it’s lessened, you’re forcing folks to come to work sick because they’re scared to use points. You’re literally having them pick between ‘do you go to work sick and ill and not feeling well or do you save that time to be with your kids and your family?’” Another worker criticized the attendance policy, arguing it makes it even more difficult to take time off for medical appointments or to be able to take time off to spend with family as railroad workers spent most of their time away from home, waiting anywhere from 12 to 30 hours in a hotel room before being called back into work on a return trip to their home. “There are 17,600 employees that work with this new attendance policy, and not one of them will tell you that it’s a good program at all. It’s completely unmanageable,” they said. Workers represented by the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, and the Transportation Division of the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail, and Transportation unions mobilized and pushed for the right to strike over the new attendance policy, but a federal judge ruled the dispute was “minor” under the Railway Labor Act, meaning workers cannot legally strike over the policy. “This is a policy that, frankly, is just blind to the moment,” said Greg Regan, president of the transportation trades department, AFL-CIO, which represents 36 labor unions in the transportation industry. “They’re turning around and punishing their employees, because they’re faced with some of the challenges that they created themselves.” He argued staffing shortages and supply chain issues have been self-made in the industry, as drastic labor cuts have been implemented in recent years, reducing the workforce and lowering overall costs, while rail transportation companies have used the supply chain crisis to increase fees and make record profits. The attendance policy change was implemented as workers have continued working through the pandemic via contract negotiations between 10 unions and over 30 railroad companies that have been ongoing since fall 2019 amid widespread labor cuts in the industry since 2017 where over 20% of staff have been cut under a new operating model. The industry is pushing to reduce two person rail crews, an engineer and a conductor, to one person crews, which unions and workers have criticized as a serious safety issue that will lead to an increase in train derailments, severely affecting communities around the country. “What the companies are offering at the bargaining table, you would think they’re facing declining revenue and decreasing profits, not recording the highest profit margin in the history of railroading,” Regan said. “It’s clear that the industry does not want to give an inch right now, and they want to continue to claw out as much profit as possible.” BNSF Railway, owned by billionaire Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, reported record profits in 2021, with operating income increasing 13.7% to $8.8bn. A spokesperson for BNSF Railway argued the new attendance policy will provide more predictability for train crews and provide more reliable crew availability. “Our program is designed to provide ample time for obligations outside work, including planned vacations, personal leave days and unplanned absences while ensuring that we have sufficient employees available to work,” a spokesperson said in an email. “Based on initial feedback, BNSF has already modified the program. We look forward to continuing to work with our employees to gather input and refine the program if needed. BNSF team members drive our success and we couldn’t deliver the nation’s goods without them. We understand that change can be an adjustment, but we believe we can adapt together to meet today’s competitive freight environment.”",News/US news,‘Completely demoralized’: US railroad workers pushed to the brink,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/14/completely-demoralized-us-railroad-workers-pushed-to-brink
3/14/2022,"The traditional men’s suit has been removed from the basket of goods used to calculate the annual inflation rate – the latest casualty of the increase in working from home since the start of the Covid pandemic two years ago. The Office for National Statistics said the change in working patterns meant the suit was no longer one of the 700 representative goods and services selected to measure the UK’s cost of living. Announcing details of this year’s changes, the ONS said a new men’s formal jacket or blazer item was being introduced to ensure men’s formal and business wear was still represented in the selection. Other items that will no longer be tracked include doughnuts, which are being replaced by multipacks of cakes, and coal, which has been removed in anticipation of the government ban on domestic sales of the fuel from next year. Other items added to the basket for the first time this year also reflected lifestyle changes since the start of the pandemic. These included antibacterial surface wipes, sports bras/crop tops and collars for dogs and cats. The ONS said demand for antibacterial products was still high, and people had responded to the pandemic by exercising more and owning more pets. Canned beans, chickpeas and lentils entered the basket for the first time alongside meat-free sausages, reflecting the growth in vegetarianism and veganism, driven by greater consciousness of health, animal welfare and environmental factors. Last year, hand sanitiser, smartwatches and hand weights for home exercise were added. Inflation is at a 30-year-high of 5.5% but is expected to rise further in the coming months as rising energy costs bite. Sam Beckett, the ONS head of economic statistics, said: “The 2022 basket of goods sees some really interesting changes, with the impact of the pandemic still evident in our shopping habits. With many people still working from home, demand for more formal clothing has continued to decrease. So, men’s suits disappear from the basket and are replaced with a formal jacket or blazer. “Last year’s lockdown living saw an increase in the number of us working out and exercising. That has continued into 2022 with the addition of the sports bra into the basket reflecting greater spending on sports clothing.” Responding to criticism from the food writer and campaigner Jack Monroe that the official inflation figure fails to reflect the true cost of living for poorer households, the ONS said it was launching a personal inflation calculator, which could be used to calculate an individual’s personal inflation experience based on their spending patterns. Beckett said: “Today’s announcement is a key part of our long-term transformation of prices collection that is designed to keep the measurement of UK inflation as accurate and relevant as possible.”",News/Business,Men’s suit removed from UK ‘inflation basket’ as Covid changes working life,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/14/mens-suit-uk-inflation-basket-covid-changes-ons
