2/22/2022,"The Age and the Sydney Morning Herald have removed an article that suggested multimillionaire Geoff Bainbridge was the victim of an elaborate six-year extortion racket, admitting they appeared to have been “badly misled” after doubts were raised about aspects of the story. The Age’s chief reporter, Chip Le Grand, wrote on Monday evening that revelations about a video depicting Bainbridge using drugs had thrown into doubt the version of events Bainbridge gave him last week about the footage being at the centre of an extortion attempt.  The original Nine story was an apparent effort by Bainbridge to counter a highly damaging story in the Australian newspaper. The Australian reported the chief executive of Lark Distillery had allegedly smoked ice in an explicit video filmed in 2021. Bainbridge, a co-founder of the burger chain Grill’d, resigned as Lark CEO when the story broke. Guardian Australia reported on Friday that the two newspapers had wildly differing versions of Bainbridge’s story but Nine was satisfied Bainbridge was telling the truth because he had provided them with multiple documents to back up his story of extortion. In the Nine story, Bainbridge claimed he was a victim of crime and had been set up by a woman he met in a bar in Asia six years ago. He claimed he was targeted by a criminal gang who extorted thousands of dollars out of him to keep quiet, but when he refused to pay any more they sent the video to journalists at News Corp Australia. Nine’s version was called into question when the Sunday Herald Sun revealed the video appeared to have been shot in Bainbridge’s own Melbourne home, which he bought in 2020, contradicting his claim in the Age and SMH that it was filmed on a wild night out in Singapore in 2015. “The former chief executive of Lark Distilling, who resigned from the publicly listed company hours before the video was broadcast, appears to have misled the Age and Herald about where and when it was taken,” Le Grand wrote in the Nine newspapers on Monday evening. Nine said its original reporting relied on documents supplied by Bainbridge who was working with a Melbourne PR adviser and a lawyer. They provided records of financial transactions made in Philippine pesos to two separate bank accounts, purported extortion demands sent this year by text message from a Malaysian WhatsApp account and “a confidential report by Control Risks, a global risk consultancy, which analysed the purported extortion attempt and advised him how to respond”. “If Mr Bainbridge confected parts of the story to the Age and Herald, it means he could have misrepresented the financial reports and text messages provided to his lawyer, a crisis management expert and the authors of the Control Risks report,” Le Grand wrote on Monday evening. The Age’s editor, Gay Alcorn, told Guardian Australia: “We believe we were badly misled and we question the veracity of the documents we received. We have retracted the story and written a follow-up that makes it clear that we believe we were misled. We will be putting a correction note in the newspaper tomorrow [Wednesday].” The Australian’s investigations writer, Sharri Markson, reported on Monday that the bedroom the videos were filmed in has the same features as the one in the house Bainbridge has lived in for 18 months. “Online real estate photographs show the master bedroom, positioned at the front of the home, features a unique light-fitting, ornate ceiling decor, period shutters, a study nook in the corner of the bedroom, a fireplace and a distinctive bedhead,” she wrote. “All of these details can be seen very clearly in three full, unpublished videos recorded by Mr Bainbridge that were obtained by the Australian.” Markson said the information suggested his story was a “fabrication” as “he obviously recorded the drug-taking video in the inner-Melbourne house he bought in late 2020”. Comment was sought from Bainbridge. Bainbridge told Nine he wasn’t an ice user and didn’t know how he came to have the drug. He also told the Age and SMH in their original story that “although I consider myself a victim of a crime, I accept that I am also responsible for the circumstances I find myself in”. “Ultimately, I put myself in a situation I shouldn’t have been in. I’m a victim of extortion but that wouldn’t have occurred without my poor judgment. I am deeply remorseful for my own actions,” he told the newspapers.",News/Media,Nine removes story as doubts raised over Geoff Bainbridge ‘ice pipe’ video extortion attempt,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/22/nine-newspapers-retract-story-suggesting-geoff-bainbridge-ice-pipe-video-was-an-extortion-attempt
2/22/2022,"Australians can expect higher petrol and gas prices and more volatile financial markets as a result of Russia’s aggression towards Ukraine but Australia’s economic rebound is unlikely to be derailed without a major escalation of hostilities, economists say. Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered his nation’s troops into two renegade regions of neighbouring Ukraine on Monday (local time).  In response, investors trimmed their exposure to riskier assets. Stock markets in Asia fell, with Australia’s benchmark ASX200 index ending down 1%, while equivalent gauges in Hong Kong earlier lost as much as 3% and Tokyo’s 2%. Oil prices rose 2.8% and touched seven-year highs on Tuesday. Saul Eslake, an independent economist, said rising crude costs were the most obvious initial effect of Russia’s actions against Ukraine. “The world might assume that Russian oil will not be available to the market either because the Russians choose not to make it available or the West chooses not to buy it or in some other way impedes the trade in oil,” Eslake said. Local petrol prices are already at record highs, reaching a national average of $1.791 cents per litre in the week to 20 February. In New South Wales on Tuesday, prices were averaging $1.816 a litre for E10 petrol, while in Melbourne E10 was $1.727 a litre. As investors become more jittery, the Australian dollar also tends to fall against the US dollar, Eslake said. Since commodities are typically priced in the US currency, the price of oil in local terms will also be higher, once the delay of about a week feeds through. Gas prices may also increase. While most of Australia’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports are based on long-term contracts to Asian customers, there may be a spike in regional prices if Qatar – the world’s second largest LNG exporter behind Australia – diverts shipments to Europe to cover for Russian shortfalls, Eslake said. Gas’s share of Australia’s electricity market has been declining as renewables push out fossil fuels. Still, to the extent gas sets electricity prices, a higher cost of that fuel would also translate into higher wholesale power prices. However, Gareth Aird, head of Australian economics at Commonwealth Bank, said the turmoil in Europe was unlikely to have a material impact on the national economy beyond the short-term fizz in financial and commodity markets. “In terms of what is going to be driving the macro Aussie economy this year, [the European tension] is not going derail that,” Aird said. The drivers include the tight labour market, households loaded up with savings, and rising inflation and wages. “The story of the Aussie economy is pretty much locked in this year and that stuff overseas won’t impact our domestic conditions,” he said. Eslake agreed, adding he does not believe the Ukraine situation “will have any impact on the Reserve Bank’s thinking about the timing or magnitude of rate increases”. The Commonwealth Bank predicts the Reserve Bank of Australia will lift its official cash rate from the record low 0.1% in June. Financial markets have lately pared back expectations of when the first rise will occur but still predict about one percentage point of increases this year. The release of the ABS’s December quarter wage price index figure on Wednesday will likely underscore the dominance of local factors on the economic outlook, Aird said. “We think we’ll see an acceleration in wages growth,” he said. In the September quarter, wages rose 0.6% and were 2.2% higher over the year. “We’re predicting 0.8% [December quarter WPI], the consensus is 0.7%, and the RBA’s implied profile is around 0.6%,” Aird said. While the differences may appear small, they will be closely watched by financial markets, he said. The reserve bank will also be looking at two consumer price index figures before it decides to move on rates, with the first of these likely to be “a red hot print”, Aird said. Card spending data released on Tuesday for the week ending 18 February showed a rebound in spending after a small fall the previous week, the Commonwealth Bank said. “There are further signs that the economy continues to normalise as new Omicron cases fall. Spending in‑store and spending on services both continued to trend higher over the week,” the bank said.",News/Business,Australian petrol price hikes and market jitters set to continue as Ukraine crisis worsens,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/22/australian-petrol-price-hikes-and-market-jitters-set-to-continue-as-ukraine-crisis-worsens
2/22/2022,"Federal immigration minister, Alex Hawke, has failed to appear in the New South Wales supreme court, despite being named as the first defendant in a case that will determine whether the NSW Liberal party branch can continue to operate beyond 28 February. Hawke did not appear or send a legal representative to the court on Tuesday, as it considered an urgent application tied to the Liberal party’s long-running saga over preselections for federal seats in NSW.  The case is now likely to be elevated to the NSW court of appeal, with a hearing set for Thursday or Friday. Scott Robertson SC, appearing for the plaintiff, Liberal state executive member Matthew Camenzuli, told the court considerable efforts had been made to reach the minister, including the service of court documents, emails and phone calls. Justice John Sacker noted Hawke’s absence and that the case had received considerable publicity in the media. There is no legal requirement for a defendant to respond to civil summons but as Sacker noted they should be given an opportunity to put their case. The second and third defendants, the NSW Liberal party president, Phillip Ruddock, and the federal president, John Olsen, were represented by senior counsel, but have indicated they do not intend to make submissions. The case, brought by Camenzuli, is ostensibly about the interpretation of the NSW party’s constitution and whether its governing body, the state executive, can continue to exist beyond 28 February, due to a delayed annual general meeting. Camenzuli wants a declaration from the court that the state executive remains validly elected. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Last week the state director, Chris Stone, presented legal advice to an extraordinary meeting of the NSW state executive suggesting federal party intervention was required to reappoint members of the state executive until the party’s postponed annual general meeting was held in March. The stalled AGM is part of a much broader factional power struggle that has left the NSW Liberal party hamstrung and without candidates in nine winnable seats just months before a federal election. They include North Sydney, Mitchell and Farrer, which have sitting MPs (including Hawke himself) as well as Warringah, Hughes, Dobell, Bennelong, and Parramatta. Hawke is prime minister Scott Morrison’s representative on the NSW vetting committee for candidates, and has been blamed by some party members for the impasse. One expressed surprise at his absence from today’s court proceedings. “It’s an extraordinary state of affairs that a federal minister would not appear in court,” the senior Liberal party member said. Internal critics say that to date, Hawke has failed to make himself available to review the possible candidates for preselection, stalling the process. Some members of the party accuse him and Morrison, who are leading figures in the centre right faction in NSW, of attempting to engineer a crisis that will require federal intervention. This would enable Morrison to have a greater say over candidates. NSW factional leaders, on the other hand, have been attempting to negotiate a deal which will fill the nine seats administratively without the need to have plebiscites. Others in the party, including Camenzuli, are outraged that factional organisers are attempting to bypass plebiscites which were recently inserted into the party’s constitution. With 90% support from the 29-member state executive required to endorse appointments, the factional organisers have struggled to pass their complex peace deal. The future of the NSW Liberal branch now comes down to the supreme court’s interpretation of the constitution. The federal branch is due to consider intervention again on 3 March. Attempts to contact Hawke were unsuccessful.",News/Australia news,Alex Hawke fails to appear in supreme court for NSW Liberal party preselection case,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/22/alex-hawke-fails-to-appear-in-supreme-court-for-nsw-liberal-party-preselection-case
2/22/2022,"If you can’t answer these three questions, the cat will die. So pay attention. Who walked on the moon – was it Alan Bean or Hugh Jass? Obviously not Hugh Jass. Who had more heads – Simon and Garfunkel or the Wu-Tang Clan? Come on, this isn’t Mastermind. A good therapist says: “Our time is up” or “Oh, boo-hoo”? Idiot! It was obviously the first option. Welcome to Cat Burglar (Netflix), an interactive cartoon in which you, the viewer, are asked increasingly tricky questions so that our hero, Rowdy Cat, can get past security dog Peanut to his goal – the priceless painting in a museum. Once he’s nicked the cat-faced approximation of the Mona Lisa, Rowdy will be so obscenely rich he’ll realise his dream of having a concert pianist play for him while – get this – they are both inside his stretch limo.  But now look what you’ve done. You’ve answered three questions incorrectly, and Rowdy is dead, floating to heaven on cartoon wings. Outside the pearly gates is a sign for newcomers that reads: “Neutered? Your testicles are waiting.” Result. But no! Peanut who, we must suppose, can fly, snips Rowdy’s wings. The cat falls straight to hell, where the devil uses Rowdy as a ball on his infernal pool table. Rack ’em up Satan, while I call the RSPCA.Up pops a box on screen: Try again. You have a chance to redeem yourself. You go back to the start, where Rowdy is on the street outside the museum selecting a way of breaching the wall. Rowdy has three lives, which, as a cat, must make him feel short-changed, but that’s how this Netflix drop works.If you attempt to watch Cat Burglar in the normal Netflix manner, splayed on the sofa, the cat comes on screen shouting at you in an accent straight out of Top Cat. Don’t just sit there, you muppet: interact! Cat Burglar was created by Charlie Brooker, along with a few geniuses including one who worked on BoJack Horseman. Four years ago, Brooker had a stab at TV interactivity with an episode from his Black Mirror series called Bandersnatch. The drama unfolded as though you were in Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, making decisions at choice points that changed the course of the adventure – though, if you didn’t choose in 10 seconds, a default decision was made for you. Bandersnatch reportedly offered one trillion paths to take. The average viewing time was 90 minutes, though adepts could cut that to 40 minutes by making the right choices. By comparison, Cat Burglar is minimally interactive. Viewers must answer general knowledge questions at points beyond which they have to pass in order to get Rowdy to his goal. It’s like Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? – if you were both viewer and contestant and couldn’t phone a friend. There’s no attempt here to match the interactive sophistication of video games, such as, say, Life is Strange, where the player gets embroiled in fetch quests and must choose from different dialogue boxes during conversations that have both short and long-term effects on the unfolding narratives. There is no strategic balancing act, only frustration that, if you answer wrongly, Rowdy loses a life. The chief pleasures of Cat Burglar aren’t really the interactive ones at all. Rather, the joy comes from the brilliantly observed homages to cartoons of the golden era before health and safety became a thing and cartoon violence was of exquisite imagination. At one point, Rowdy is doing a high-wire walk into the museum compound, but a bird snips the phone wire in two. Rowdy, witlessly, holds the pieces of wire together before realising his mistake. There’s a split second in which his hapless gaze confronts the viewers’ – like Gromit’s when Wallace has done something stupid, or Sylvester the cat before he plummets to oblivion – then Rowdy is electrocuted. As Rowdy gets fried, the orchestra strikes up a rumba, angel wings sprout from his body and the cat ghost starts shaking a pair of maracas. The incidental music, too, is a note-perfect nostalgia trip for screwball cartoon fetishists. There’s a bongo roll whenever Rowdy starts his run-up, pizzicati when he tiptoes into the museum, sarcastic trumpet wa-wa-wahs when he gets his comeuppance. The credits don’t read Tex Avery or Fred Quimby, but their spirits haunt the show. It took my daughter and me about half an hour to get to the end – and then only after some minor unpleasantness when she was poised to give the answer Cumberbatch to the question “Which is a type of dad clothing?” (Correct answer? Cummerbund). But we’ll be going back to the beginning – there’s a superb fight involving a guillotine in the Hall of Ancient Weapons between Peanut and Rowdy that cries out to be seen again.

2/22/2022,"Robert Edric’s memoir of his Sheffield childhood opens with one of the best set pieces I’ve ever read in this kind of book: an absolute masterclass in how to set a scene. It is 1968 or thereabouts, and in the small rented house the author shares with his family, something even more than usually unnerving is happening. Why, wonders 12-year-old Robert, has his father, a man whose vanity, bullying and tendency to show off conceal all manner of unspoken insecurities, chosen to come home early from work today? What on earth is going on? The situation can’t possibly be good: for obvious reasons, his son cherishes the 90 minutes between his arrival from school and the sound of his dad at the door. But… oh dear. In truth, the merest glance provides an explanation. His father, who is bald, is proudly sporting a toupee. Edric senses he must tread carefully. When his father overrules his mother, who’s busy pretending that her husband simply has a “new hairstyle”, and proceeds to show his son how his expensive “Crown Topper” is stuck to his head with special double-sided tape, the boy tries hard to appear impressed. “You can hardly see the difference,” he says, feigning a search for the invisible seam between the toupee and his father’s real hair (it’s not even remotely invisible, for while the toupee is gingery, what remains of his father’s hair is grey). Edric already knows in his gut that this wig is an “explosive charge” placed at the centre of his home. What, for instance, will happen when people outside the family notice it? (And frankly, how could they not?) Mockery is bound to follow. Worse, he and his siblings and their mother will henceforth be complicit in an embarrassing charade. The wig will never be mentioned again. It will just sit there, either on his father’s bonce, or draped over the polystyrene head supplied by Crown Topper, until the end of days. It is the weave of doom.  This is the first time Edric, who is best known as a novelist, has written autobiography, and his approach – once the wig is out of the way – is singular. My Own Worst Enemy reads like a kind of inventory, each short chapter devoted to one aspect of working-class life in Sheffield in the 1960s. He writes about smoking and drinking and the grammar school that separates him from his peers; about his extended family, and the various kinds of house in which its members live, whether newly built by the council, or Victorian and arranged around a shared yard and an outside loo; about Fine Fare, the supermarket where he gets a Saturday job as a teenager, and about the holiday camp on the east coast to which they travel every summer. The detail is incredible, a film running before the reader’s eyes. Whether he is describing an onyx cigarette lighter or a spinning leather chair, you realise all that you have forgotten, but he has not, and you feel both grateful and just a little alarmed. Though Edric eventually escaped his tyrannical father – the book’s central character, and a coercive controller avant la lettre – this is principally a social history and therefore a book that is, in ways both straightforward and profound, about loss. I appreciated Edric’s lack of sentimentality. I wouldn’t say that he’s cruel about his people, a tribe he will one day leave far behind (thanks to his grammar school teachers, the first men he’s able truly to respect, he will get a place at Hull University, his arrival at which draws this memoir to a close). But he won’t make excuses for them: here they are, warts (toupees) and all. People fall out, and don’t speak for years. Both adults and children are cruel to those who are different, or poorer than them, or more desperate. A mother passes off her daughter as her sister. A divorced father struggles not to cry. In some ways, everything is out there, entrails on a plate. Edric’s father makes no effort to hide from his mother “the fancy piece” he has begun driving to work every morning. Men are always fighting, and vomiting all over their front doorsteps. In other ways, though, much is deeply buried, utterly concealed. People don’t talk, not really. Every little house is a locked box, impenetrable to outsiders, and sometimes even to insiders, too. The 60s, of course, are happening elsewhere. Not that elsewhere really exists, for Edric. Even the Peak District, which borders Sheffield in the most startling way, vast housing estates suddenly giving way to moorland, is a far-off realm for him (he sees it only once a year, from the windows of the charabanc that takes the Fine Fair staff on their works outing). As for the city, though we hear it – the steel industry is still going strong, and “the beating of distant machinery could always be heard” – we don’t really see it, or not much of it. If Jane Austen gave us two inches of ivory, Edric works on a single roof slate. I’m from Sheffield, too, and I recognised a lot that he describes; the house he grew up in, reached through a kind of tunnel between the terraces, is built to the same design as my granny’s. But with this book, geography is really neither here nor there. Its beautiful topography has to do with the hills of the heart, and the canals of the soul; with the great rivers of memory and experience that sometimes bind us tightly together, but far more often separate us, making us feel so very lonely and misunderstood.

At the time, I was told my outstanding Igloo balance of £197 would be applied to my account. In December I kept chasing and was eventually told a cheque had been sent on 31 January. It has not arrived. All subsequent emails have been ignored – including those to the CEO’s office.  LR, by email We have been getting a great many letters along these lines in recent months, but I have to say I think you are being a bit harsh on Sainsbury’s Energy. More than 25 suppliers have collapsed since the energy crisis hit, with all the affected customers moved to one of a handful of suppliers that have, in effect, been paid to take them on by the regulator Ofgem. Inevitably, it takes a great deal of work to move a whole customer base from one business to another, complete with credit and debit balances, and direct debit payments that arrived before and after the day the supplier failed. I’m all for consumers asserting their rights, but in this case, it was fair to give the supplier time to resolve this. Your balance was always going to be credited to your new account under the Ofgem rules, and Sainsbury’s Energy told me this week that this has now happened. Spare a thought for people whose transfer was not so straightforward – those who dispute what they owe, or are owed by their old supplier that is now managed by administrators.

2/22/2022,"Hundreds of thousands of tonnes of surplus food that could be going to hungry families is going to waste as supermarkets restrict who their suppliers can give it to, according to food distribution charities. Several independent charities, which are grouped together under the Xcess network, say they struggle to source unwanted edible food from manufacturers and processors because of supermarkets’ rules about the handling of their own-label products.  At least 200,000 tonnes of own-label food fit for human consumption ends up as animal food or is used to generate energy, according to research by the sustainability group Anthesis, because of difficulties in getting it to the right place. Mark Game, the chief executive of the charity The Bread and Butter Thing, a food club that hands out heavily discounted food parcels to 25,000 registered members, said: “Retailers hold the cards – unless they say yes to manufacturers, they just can’t give [the food] out. “Demand constantly outstrips supply and we are having to let people down, and if we had this food we could do more.” David France, the manager of the Lancaster-based community food club Eggcup, said it was impossible to get hold of the food without the retailers’ permission. “As a fairly new organisation with a tremendous level of growth, we have not been able to establish relationships with larger organisations,” he said. “It is ridiculous how much food is being thrown away because retailers have contracts with larger [charities], which aren’t always able to use that surplus.” About half the food we buy every year comes from supermarkets’ own brands, and it is estimated that they make up more than 72% of edible surplus food in supermarkets’ supply chains, according to the Anthesis research. However, with suppliers often packing own-label products for multiple retailers, it is not clear who has ownership of the waste, and it is difficult to get permission from each supermarket involved to hand on unwanted items. Wrap, the government-backed recycling body, highlighted the issue last summer and issued new guidance calling on retailers to rethink rules that largely limit the redistribution of their unwanted own-label foods to two large charities, FareShare and Company Shop. It called on retailers to share information so that their suppliers are automatically mandated to directly hand surplus food to a list of smaller charities, including The Bread and Butter Thing, which have already passed tests showing they meet established standards on food safety and redistribution. Since then, only Sainsbury’s has changed its setup to enable all its own-label suppliers to pass on goods directly without signing numerous local agreements. Tesco and Asda currently only allow suppliers to hand out surplus own-label food to small charities via FareShare and Company Shop or if audited by FareShare. Morrisons allows its suppliers to give direct handouts to a wider number of named groups but charities and suppliers say they have to cut individual deals rather than gaining easy access via a national mandate. Game said the change from Sainsbury’s was welcome but many suppliers would not separate out waste food by the supermarket it was packed or processed for, as this added costs and time for hard-pressed businesses. He said a step change in the handling of food waste would not be possible until all the major grocers changed their approach. Andy Mitchell at Worldwide Fruit, which supplies a wide range of produce including apples, pears and nectarines to big supermarkets, said: “We supply FareShare but they can only take a certain amount of volume.” He said working directly with The Bread and Butter Thing had enabled the company to increase the amount of edible surplus food it redistributed by a third. It had been able to work with the charity to deal with more difficult-to-process waste, such as end-of-season fruit that was not usually economic to pick or produce and was packed in a way that did not suit FareShare’s systems. “Having more than one charity in the mix makes a significant difference in the flexibility to take product,” he said. A spokesperson for Asda said it was in the process of changing its systems to meet Wrap guidelines: “We are already adopting the broader elements of the Wrap guidelines and onboarding charities such as The Bread and Butter Thing and City Harvest and others so they can receive food direct from our suppliers as well as from our stores, depots and FareShare as they do already.” A Tesco spokesperson said: “We are fully compliant with Wrap’s food donation guidelines and are part of their working group which helps to create the guidance. “Our food donation programme is the largest of its kind in the UK and to date we have provided more than 135m meals to FareShare, supporting thousands of independent charities and food banks in communities across the UK.” A spokesperson for Morrisons said: “We work with hundreds of small independent food distribution groups up and down the country, together with the larger groups such as The Bread and Butter Thing on a national and regional level. Both of these initiatives allow for surplus own-label food to be redistributed in a thoughtful and impactful way.”",News/Business,"Supermarkets wasting 200,000 tonnes of food that could go to needy, say charities",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/22/supermarkets-wasting-200000-tonnes-of-food-that-could-go-to-needy-say-charities
2/22/2022," Kanya King, Mobo awards founder I met Jamal in the early days when SBTV was just starting. He would be on the Mobo red carpet capturing social media content. This was at a time when people didn’t realise the power of content, especially from talent underrepresented by the mainstream. He was always so keen to ensure that he got the most interesting interviews, the best music videos, the best freestyle. Jamal was passionate about pushing his scene and culture and that’s what made him so special. When it came to what he wanted to achieve for his community and culture, he set the bar high and never missed it. Growing up, he was surrounded by talented musicians but their work was hard to find and he found a way to showcase the music he enjoyed and support artists through being an early adopter of YouTube. He catapulted artists to a global audience at a crucial time when not many did not showcase their work. When I started the Mobo awards in 1996, it was extremely rare to have any Black CEOs in a position of influence in the music industry. We all had to overcome so many obstacles but we had a camaraderie through a common goal of trying to push the next generation to continue elevating Black news and culture. Jamal carried that fighting spirit. He had that same belief that we had, about fighting for your dream scene. We wanted any young person from any background to be able to think big and be inspired. He was such a dynamic, driven and inspirational person. Post-SBTV, you saw the arrival of Link Up TV and GRM Daily. Jamal created friendly competitiveness that pushed the scene forward. Even though he was young, he leaves behind a powerful legacy that defined and will shape Black music and culture for generations to come. Nadia Rose, musician In summer 2015 I put out my first music video. SBTV wrote an article about it, which was crazy, I couldn’t believe SBTV had seen my little video. Afterwards, Kane Chattey, a writer at SBTV, asked if I wanted to put my next music video on the platform. I did and that was my first time going viral. Jamal was fully behind that decision and SBTV heavily supported me. From then on I put out all my videos on SBTV and built a relationship with Jamal. In the music and entertainment industries, it is rare to find people like Jamal. He had a clean heart and was so genuine. It didn’t matter how small a win was, he’d always be the first to congratulate me and I would almost always soon after find out he had something to do with it. He really kept you motivated, whether it was seeing what he was doing himself, or what he would say to you. At least 90% of the UK music scene has had Jamal do something with them or their careers. He was a cultural architect, a powerhouse. In one of our last meetups, we went to the V&A museum. It was so dope. As much as I was learning about the artefacts, I was learning about Jamal. He was cracking so many jokes that day, he was always so charismatic and had great energy to be around. You couldn’t leave his space feeling down or negative. He always had positive vibrations. Not3s, musician As a kid I was watching SBTV for the longest time. People like Devlin, the times Ed [Sheeran] was on there, Krept and Konan – there were a lot of people in the scene that I recognised through it. For me, it was inspiring and motivating because it allowed me to know that even though I come from a background similar to those that are on this channel, or to the person that ran and owned the channel, I could still achieve anything that I wanted to achieve in life. SBTV always made me feel like I could do something – even before I became an artist. The first time I ever met Jamal Edwards was after the GRM Rated awards, before I was ever nominated for one – I just went there as a spectator. I was outside and said hello to him. He didn’t know exactly who I was until we messaged after, and from then we stayed in touch. Today I was going through my messages from him and I realised how consistently he’d message me about what I was doing, how many times I was mentioned in his [Instagram] story. He was proper there, no matter what. He was always there to check for everyone. The whole time I’ve known him, that’s what I’ve seen. He was there to make sure that all the dreamers – and all those that are motivated to do something different from what they might be stuck in in their environments – know they’re capable of pushing. With words, music, sounds, they’re capable of reaching a whole other level. Just off a dream. That’s something that he would let everybody know and explore to the best of their abilities with his help and his platform and his channel. He didn’t need to start up a channel or platform. He could have lived his life, gone to uni and kept on with himself – but no, he cared so much about everybody else. From overground to the underground, from the Ed Sheerans to the Devlins to the Ghetts, the Krept and Konans, he cared about the whole spectrum. He never let anybody’s colour get in the way of whatever he was doing. He never let anybody’s situation in life get in the way of what they were capable of doing. It’s inspiring for all of those coming up that might want to create something like his, or being a creative in general. It’s proper sad. It’s definitely gonna have a deep effect on the scene as a whole. Lady Leshurr, musician Jamal Edwards was a pioneer, entrepreneur, culture shifter and made a huge impact in UK music that gave us up-and-coming artists exposure all around the world. He helped so many of us that went off to do some great things and become successful. He always helped his people and was forever breaking down barriers and helping the kids have a better future by funding and opening up youth centres and partnering with the Department for Education to encourage young people to undertake apprenticeships. Such a heart full of gold. Rupa Huq, MP for for Ealing Central and Acton Jamal Edwards was a force of nature, once met never forgotten. He worked hard to push the boundaries of Black British music from his teens onwards. With a camera given to him by his mum Brenda and a YouTube channel, he democratised the platforms by which young people could get their music out to a wider public. His contribution to the way we make music today is immeasurable – demystifying the music biz with the SBTV platform that allowed kids to get out their music direct without unnecessary stultifying layers of bureaucracy. Yet he was never bombastic and showy or self-aggrandising. He was the opposite – always giving back to his community. I joined him at council functions like the opening of a youth centre and switching on the Christmas lights – but he first came to me as a punter at my MP advice surgery with ideas about a youth work charity he was setting up. He championed youth expression through the arts, be it recording studios in youth clubs on estates, or our recently opened community arthouse cinema in a repurposed semi-derelict library on Acton high street. He was there just the other day. My timeline today is full of charities I work with as MP mourning his passing and praising him for helping out behind the scenes – Acton Homeless Concern, Ealing Soup Kitchen, Ealing Wildlife Group. It’s almost a quasi-Diana thing: we only knew about many of her charitable works after her death. The mural to Jamal – unveiled only last year – is a site where flowers are being laid today, analogous to the David Bowie wall in Brixton that’s now a shrine. Except Jamal has been taken from us sooner than either. He still had so much more to give. He may be gone but never forgotten. Miraa May, musician He was the kind of person who if he felt like you were talented, he would just back you. He wouldn’t wait for anybody else to co-sign you before he lent you a helping hand. In my case, he gave me a platform to be able to sing rap songs on guitar and it not translate in a bad way. SBTV A64 was one of the first co-signs I got from anyone that was like: she’s sick, we really mess with her. His SBTV Summer Cookout was one of my first performances where I felt like wow, this is a really big crowd. That’s one of the biggest reasons why now I’m able to go on stage and be really comfortable. And it’s not like he would invite us one year and then not invite us again. He was a constant friend. He would listen and always be ready to help. If we needed anything and we hit him up, he wouldn’t air [ignore] you. And he didn’t want anything in return, which is something that you don’t find in this industry at all. He’s in the top three people who pushed UK music and the culture forward. A lot of people including myself would not be here without him. Everybody who he has given a platform, you can always go back and look at their humble beginnings and see where they are now. It only takes one person to give you a platform, to believe in you and say: I’m going to shout about it and let everyone know. That’s something that doesn’t come without some sort of payment these days. With him, it was just very pure. He brought so many people together. I remember watching all of the rappers sharing one stage and there were no issues. He was one of the first people to give us a platform – and give us a party. Somewhere where everyone can go and be celebrated. He was a pioneer. He was one of the people – if not the person – who started what a lot of us are running on now. Vie Marshall, music journalist I was one of the early Black music journalists and club organisers in this country. It’s taken a whole lot of us to open the door, and Jamal propelled everything we started to a level we could only dream of. When I was working on [magazines] Hip-Hop Connection and Blues & Soul, we either had to be very militantly revolutionary or obsequious in the face of people who assumed the worst. I started the first regular rap night, Muthaland, and we had to go out of our way to assure everybody that there wasn’t going to be violence and drug taking. Those were times where everything was a battle – for Black people and young Black kids to be seen as humans with something good to contribute to the world. It’s taken a lot for people to inch their way in. And then Jamal comes along, with his finger on the internet’s pulse, possibly influenced by people like So Solid Crew, where you were able to see people from the streets being successful. He was upset that he wasn’t seeing people that had talent get into the mainstream. A lot of people get into the music industry or media in a self-serving way because they have ambitions for themselves. And from everything I saw of him, it was selfless and community-driven. He used his good karma to put a lot of people on. Owen Jones, journalist It was in the run-up to the 2015 election when I appeared with Jamal Edwards on a Sky One special on young people and voting, and he crackled with passion, insight and humanity. With mainstream politics, media and increasingly pop music so dominated by the privileged, it’s notable that it’s hip-hop and grime which have produced outspoken voices of working-class young people such as Jamal. It’s those young people who understand the significance of youth centres – a decade ago, London had 299, but now has just 166 – which is what drove his passion to re-open them. Given the particular stigma among men attached to discussing mental health, it’s no exaggeration that celebrated icons like Jamal speaking out has helped save lives. A generation has lost one of its most compelling voices: but his legacy will have inspired so many more.",Arts/Music,"‘He was a cultural architect, a powerhouse’: musicians and peers pay tribute to Jamal Edwards",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/22/tributes-to-jamal-edwards
2/22/2022,"According to police in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, it was suicide. The young Muslim man they had brought into their custody had, out of despair, killed himself in the police station toilets. But, as photos of the scene emerged, so too did suspicions.The 22-year-old man, Altaf, was 165cm (5ft 5in) tall and weighed 60kg (9.5 stone), but the toilet tap he had supposedly hanged himself from was just 76cm off the ground and made of flimsy plastic. And why, as the police later claimed in court, was the CCTV in the police station mysteriously not working that day? Family and friends tell a very different story: that Altaf, a Muslim man living in the town of Kasganj, was in love with and planned to marry a Hindu girl. That powerful local Hindu vigilante groups opposed to interfaith unions found out and reported him to the police. And that on 9 November 2021, Altaf was arrested and tortured to death in police custody and his family pressured to keep quiet.  “The police murdered my son and then gave me money to say he was depressed and took his own life,” says Altaf’s father, Chand Miya, an illiterate mason who has taken the case to the state high court. “But I will not stay quiet, I want justice.” Last Friday, the courts ordered Altaf’s body to be exhumed and a new postmortem examination to be carried out.  This month, Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state and home to more than 200 million people – similar to the population of Brazil – goes to the polls in a state election that will continue until early March. Since 2017, the state has been ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which also controls India's central government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The election is being viewed as a vote on Hindu nationalist politics on a state and national level. BJP's Yogi Adityanath, a hardline Hindu monk with a history of allegations of hate speech, has denied any prejudice towards Muslims. It comes ahead of India's general elections in 2024. Altaf was not the first to die in such circumstances in Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state, which is holding a high-stakes election this month. In six cases examined by the Guardian of deaths in custody and police shootings of suspects, allegedly in self defence, from 2018 onwards, those accused of carrying out and covering up killings are the same: the Uttar Pradesh police, under the rule of the state’s chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, and his Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) government. The victims of these alleged unlawful killings were all from the communities that Adityanath’s government, with its sectarian Hindu nationalist agenda, is accused of routinely targeting and oppressing: Muslims, who make up 20% of the state’s population and who have been subjected to increased lynchings, hate speech and prejudicial legislation, and Dalits, who are at the bottom of India’s oppressive Hindu caste system and were previously referred to as “untouchables”. The elections will decide whether to return Adityanath’s state government to power for another five years. It is being seen as a referendum on Hindu nationalist politics – the push for India to become a Hindu, rather than secular, nation – on both a state and national level, and is happening against a backdrop of rising religious intolerance and anti-Muslim hate speech in India. Not long after he took office in 2017, Adityanath, a hardline Hindu monk, made it clear that his agenda would be twofold: a fierce promotion of Hindu nationalism and a tough crackdown on crime. “Agar aparadh karenge, toh thok diye jayenge [If anyone commits a crime, he will be knocked down],” he said in June 2017. From that point on, lawyers, activists and ex-police officers allege that “thok denge” – slang for “shoot them” – became unofficial policy in Uttar Pradesh. Police allegedly began carrying out “instant justice”, maiming or executing those they deemed to be criminals, and were professionally rewarded for doing so. Lawyers and families of victims describe an atmosphere of terror in Uttar Pradesh, where Muslims and lower-caste men are picked up on the streets and killed with alleged impunity by police, either in what are known as “encounter killings”, in which officers fatally shoot their captives and claim it was in self-defence, or in police custody, where they are beaten or tortured to death. The same police accused of the murders are often then responsible for the investigations. Subsequently, police reports are often not lodged, evidence and CCTV footage routinely disappears, charges filed to the courts are watered down to “accidental death” and some cases disappear altogether. “The police are now mercenaries of the Yogi government,” says Rajeev Yadav, an activist running for a seat in the forthcoming election in Azamgarh, which has a large Muslim population and has experienced multiple “encounter killings” by police. In the past five years, according to the government, there have been more than 8,700 shootings by police in the state, including more than 3,000 incidents when allegedly escaping suspects were shot, often in the knees, and more than 150 deaths. There are rarely any eyewitnesses to these encounters, according to human rights organisations that have examined many of the cases. Not a single officer who fatally shot someone in Uttar Pradesh in the past five years has faced disciplinary action. Two former police officers told the Guardian that in their experience most so-called “encounter killings” were falsified by police. In the case of Kamran, a 40-year-old Muslim water-seller from Azamgarh, police claimed he was apprehended on his way to commit a crime in Lucknow, 200 miles from his home, and then killed after a shootout with an anti-terrorism unit. But a lawyer, Ashma Izzat, says the evidence, including a leaked police photograph that appears to show him alive and in police custody – a direct contradiction of the police account of events – demonstrated the events in November 2021 were covered up. Kamran’s body was returned to his family with signs of torture. “He had a perforated eye, dark bruising around his neck and body, a broken collar bone and leg, and four of his front teeth knocked out,” said his 87-year-old father, Nasim Ahmed. Police later filed a report that Kamran had been an absconding criminal in multiple cases with a 25,000 rupee (£250) reward on his head. But Kamran made daily visits to the police station to deliver water as part of his job, including on the day he was killed. Uttar Pradesh has the highest number of deaths in police custody in the country. Officially, there have been 23 deaths over the past three years but Mehmood Pracha, one of the few lawyers who has taken cases of custodial killings to India’s highest court, said this was likely to be a “significant undercount”. “The police hide these custody deaths when they can get away with it, and won’t even tell the family,” says Pracha. In several cases, grief-stricken families said they have been pressurised or threatened by police to withdraw charges and stay silent. Faisal Husain, an 18-year-old Muslim vegetable seller from Unnao, was among those allegedly beaten to death in police custody in May 2021. The case is now in the supreme court and the Guardian listened to recordings of threats and offers of money made to Hussain’s sister, Khushnuma Banu, 28, over the phone, to pressure her to withdraw the case. In another two cases of killings in custody examined by the Guardian, the police had not given families details of the postmortem examination, despite them being legally bound to do so. Police claim that Arun Valmiki, a 30-year-old Dalit man from Agra, died of a heart attack in police custody in October 2021, but withheld the postmortem report from his family, who allege he was tortured and electrocuted to death by police. “Police put pressure on me to say that my brother had heart problems but it’s not true – he was strong and healthy,” says his brother Sonu Narwal. Ziauddin, a 38-year-old Muslim businessman, died in police custody in March 2021 after being picked up by police for alleged theft. The police claimed he died from a heart attack during questioning despite him being in robust health. When Ziauddin’s body was returned to his family, it was covered in torture wounds, including cigarette burns, bruises around his neck and across his body, and signs he had been electrocuted, visible in photographs viewed by the Guardian. Despite almost a year of requests, the police continue to withhold the postmortem report from his family and have not submitted the legally mandated “charge sheet” to the courts. The family say they were offered money by the police to withdraw the case. “He was the most kind, honest, gentle man, who had never committed a crime,” said Alauddin, Ziauddin’s father. “I feel so terrible that he was murdered and we will never get justice for him.” The Uttar Pradesh government denied all the allegations. “There are judicial systems in place and no extrajudicial killings have taken place. This narrative is totally false and we deny such baseless accusations,” it said in a statement. Prashant Kumar, the additional director general of police in Uttar Pradesh, said the Uttar Pradesh police strictly follow all procedures and guidelines laid out by the courts and the National Human Rights Commission. Kumar described a “zero-tolerance” approach to custodial killings in which guilty officers are always suspended and jailed. However, in several of the custodial death cases examined by the Guardian, junior officers were suspended but none were in prison. No senior officer or government official under the Adityanath government has faced disciplinary action for either “encounter killings” on the street or deaths in police custody. Kumar said there was no religious or caste bias in the police force, and no culture of silencing victims. “How can we distinguish between our own citizens? It is not possible and it is wrong,” he said. “No government can ask us to do anything which is wrong or illegal.” Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",News/Global development, ‘Shoot them’: Indian state police accused of murdering Muslims and Dalits,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/22/uttar-pradesh-elections-hindu-nationalist-yogi-adityanath-police-accused-unlawful-deaths-muslims-dalits
2/22/2022,"Hello. Warren Murray once again presenting the news you need.  UN security council members have blasted Russia after Vladimir Putin officially recognised two breakaway areas of Ukraine and ordered his troops to go in as purported “peacekeepers”. Addressing an emergency session of the council held in the last few hours, the US ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said: “He calls them peacekeepers. This is nonsense. We know what they really are.” Thomas-Greenfield accused Putin of making a “series of outrageous, false claims” that were aimed at “creating a pretext for war … Putin wants to travel back to a time when empires ruled the world. This is not 1919.” We have rolling coverage at our Ukraine crisis live blog. Russia’s security council representative, Vasily Nebenzya, claimed the west was “nudging” Ukraine towards conflict and accused other nations of overlooking the plight of those in the Donbas. Ukraine’s ambassador, Sergiy Kyslytsya, replied that his country’s borders remain “unchangeable” despite Russia’s actions. “We demand from Russia to cancel the decision on recognition and return to the table of negotiations.” As Shaun Walker writes, Putin on Monday performed in an angry, absurdist double-billing on Russian television – first, snapping across a vast room at his assembled security council, effectively daring any of them to disagree with him; then afterwards, making a national address hectoring Ukraine as “a colony with a puppet regime” that had no historical right to exist. The TV spectacle carries on from a series of clumsy, readily debunked fake films supposed to show Ukrainian aggression but actually based, for example, on purloined recordings of Finnish military exercises from years ago, and pre-staged footage of “evacuations” from supposedly besieged areas of Ukraine held by Russian-backed rebels. As we send today’s briefing, Boris Johnson is due to be chairing a Cobra meeting about the UK response including immediate sanctions. Earlier on Monday, Joe Biden signed an executive order to prohibit trade and investment between US individuals and the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk republics that Putin recognised. The US announced potential sanctions against anyone operating within the Moscow-backed territories. A senior administration official said more US sanctions would be announced on Tuesday, and would be proportionate to Russian actions overnight. Farmers blast Brexit policies – The government has shown a “total lack of understanding” of British food production and risks “repeatedly running into crises” through the lack of a post-Brexit plan for farming, Minette Batters, president of the National Farmers’ Union, will say today. The savaging of ministers’ failures comes as farmers suffer plunging exports and reams of new red tape, staff shortages from EU workers leaving, and the prospect of floods of cheap low-quality imports. Batters will highlight the fate of the pig industry – producers are looking after 200,000 pigs that they can’t get slaughtered, and around 40,000 have had to be culled, about which Boris Johnson made jokes. Batters will tell the NFU conference in Birmingham: “We have completely contradictory government policies. It is raising the bar for environmental standards at home but pursuing trade deals which support lower standards overseas.” ‘Tidal wave’ – The number of homeless people in England is predicted to jump by a third to 66,000 by 2024, as councils warn of a “tidal wave” of need caused by benefits freezes, soaring food and energy bills and the end of Covid eviction bans. Councils in London, where living costs are highest, are predicting the biggest surge. The projections come as government measures to prevent homelessness during the pandemic are unwound. The government has announced a homelessness prevention fund for councils but the housing charity Crisis is calling on the government to further increase the local housing allowance – the amount the state will pay to cover rent for people on benefits – so it truly covers the cost of rent across the country. ‘Progress is slow’ – The number of women in FTSE 100 boardroom roles has jumped to 39.1% from 12.5% 10 years ago, data has revealed. However, the Fawcett Society says the figures do not capture the “shocking lack of diversity” laid bare in its 2022 Sex and Power Index, with “women of colour, disabled women and LGBTQ people missing from positions of power”. Jemima Olchawski, the Fawcett Society’s chief executive, said: “In the majority of boardrooms men continue to be overrepresented. When we look at the most senior positions of CEO and chair the progress is painfully slow.” Women make up only eight of the chief executives at the UK’s top 100 listed companies. Ovarian cancer going undiagnosed – GPs and women are still ignoring key symptoms of ovarian cancer despite better awareness of the disease, a charity has warned. Symptoms include frequently having a swollen tummy or feeling bloated; pain or tenderness in the tummy or the pelvis; having no appetite or feeling full quickly after eating; and an urgent need to pee or needing to pee more often, according to the NHS. Katy Stephenson, 47, from Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, told of being diagnosed with early-stage ovarian cancer when admitted to hospital with suspected appendicitis. “If that hadn’t happened, the cancer probably would have spread, and I hate to think about what would have happened.” Target Ovarian Cancer has called for more government support for awareness campaigns. Hedgehogs claw way back – Britain’s hedgehogs are showing signs of an urban-led recovery, according to a new report. Overall they have been experiencing a dramatic fall in numbers due to loss of habitat, attacks by dogs, vanishing prey and being run over. Fay Vass, head of the British Hedgehog Preservation Society (BHPS), said rural populations had been declining by between 30% and 75% since the year 2000. “In contrast, the urban hedgehog seems to have stabilised and might even be starting to recover … So that’s a glimmer of hope.” The total UK hedgehog population was believed to be about 879,000 in 2018. They are primarily threatened by habitat loss and the accompanying lack of prey such as beetles and earthworms. Hugh Warwick, an ecologist, encourages gardeners to keep messier, hedgehog-friendly gardens rather than succumbing to the “cult of tidiness driven by gardening programmes and glossy magazines”. While US Democrats struggle to follow through on promises of police reform, Republicans are trying to keep voters’ attention on rising crime rates. Lauren Gambino reports.

My neighbour next door but one, he’s lived here for over 10 years – he’s never seen anything like this.” Flooding, power cuts and destruction to homes continue to impact people in parts of the country after three named storms struck the UK in a week. What price an Olympic gold medal these days? We know about the blood, sweat and tears, but the costs paid by the 15-year-old figure skater Kamila Valieva in pursuit of the glittering prize rose exorbitantly over the past week in Beijing. The already unstable Olympic currency of values, integrity and humanity devalued further. Team GB’s Winter Olympics curling success has drawn a new generation to the ice, with Scotland’s rinks inundated with inquiries since the weekend’s medal-winning performances. Novak Djokovic returned to competition for the first time since his deportation from Australia last month, defeating the wildcard Lorenzo Musetti 6-3, 6-3 to reach the second round of the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships. Romelu Lukaku has mostly been a conundrum since returning to Chelsea last summer and, while the £97.5m striker has not done much talking off the pitch since that ill-advised chat with Sky Italia at the end of December, nothing summed up his struggles more than when he produced a performance of record-breaking anonymity against Crystal Palace last Saturday. Christian Eriksen has stepped up his push to return to frontline football after another impressive friendly run-out for Brentford. Oil has jumped to a seven-year high, safe havens rallied and US stock futures dived after Vladimir Putin ordered troops into eastern Ukraine. Asian stocks have fallen while the safe-haven yen rose as much as 0.2% at one point to a nearly three-week high of 114.50 per dollar. Understandably the FTSE is tracking to open lower this morning while the pound is sitting on $1.358 and €1.203 at time of writing. The late edition of the Guardian today leads with “Putin scorns west as Russian troops enter eastern Ukraine” – earlier versions had Putin on a “collision course with west” after recognising the breakaway regions of Ukraine. The Express kept Covid as its splash – “Boris: time to get our confidence back” – but updated its late-edition Ukraine headline to “‘Bloodshed’ warning as Putin sends in troops”. The Mail as well stays with the end of restrictions in England: “Boris throws off shackles” – it also updated its Ukraine headline to reflect Putin’s troop deployment. The i is more glass half empty about the post-restrictions era with “New Covid plan: pay for your own test” – the front page also says “UK to hit Russia with sanctions as Putin ‘orders troops into Ukraine to keep peace’”. The Mirror says “Lateral blow” about the end of free testing and accuses Boris Johnson of a “bonfire of virus safeguards”. Its front-page picture is of fiery Russian exercises in Belarus – the accompanying words in the late edition, “Putin orders troops in”. The Metro has “PM: now it’s over to you” and its final edition has a strapline across the bottom of page one: “‘Troops cross border’ as Putin backs Ukraine rebels”. The Telegraph has “Putin warns of bloodshed as he moves troops into Ukraine” while the Times says simply “Putin sends tanks into Ukraine”.
