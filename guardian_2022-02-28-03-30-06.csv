2/28/2022,"During its 300 or so years in Britain, tea has made the transition from the exotic to the ordinary. Initially arriving as a Chinese mild stimulant, by the 1860s it was so prevalent that it could be written that “the great Anglo-Saxon race are essentially a tea-drinking people”. The national drink had a dark history: the taste for sugary tea fuelled the British empire; it underpinned the slave trade; and led to the Opium wars. But an academic paper last month found that the cuppa was much more central to England’s own development than previously understood. Historians like to ask why the Industrial Revolution took place here in the 18th century and not elsewhere in Europe or Asia. Answers have ranged from religion to culture to politics. Several historians argue that sugar played a critical role in fuelling workers. Could it be that sweet, boiled water infused with a mildly addictive plant produced a healthier as well as more energetic population just when England needed labour? That appears to be the case put forward by Francisca Antman, an economist at the University of Colorado. It is not a new thesis in academic circles, but Prof Antman provides the first quantitative evidence that tea drinking powered the Industrial Revolution, by increasing the health of workers. Her study reveals that the practice of boiling water for tea lowered mortality rates by 25% in lower water-quality parishes. This “accidental improvement” in public health, she argues, occurred just as people were moving into cities, where the crowding together would otherwise have unleashed devastating epidemics. Instead, the country possessed a healthy pool of labour needed for industrialisation. The country’s population tripled in roughly a century after 1750, creating a bigger domestic market for goods and amplifying the impact of the technological revolution. One of the key moments that shifted tea from a luxury good enjoyed by the elite to a mass market drink came, the Antman paper argues, in 1784 when the tea tax was cut from 119% to 12.5% at one stroke. By the end of the century, even the humblest peasant drank tea twice a day. Tea’s distinct properties helped it become the nation’s favourite. Only a few leaves were needed to make a decent pot and leaves can be reused, thus decoupling the link between income and consumption. The East India Company also muscled out a rival – coffee – by pushing its tea in the home market. Tea gardens made the drink a cultural custom, as did the sanctity of the worker’s tea break. Thus the paradox, Prof Antman argues, “of why England experienced a decline in mortality rates over this period without an increase in wages, living standards, or nutrition can be explained in part by the widespread adoption of tea as the national beverage and the commensurate increased consumption of boiled water”. Perhaps some enterprising academic will one day pin our present economic woes on the current turn towards coffee. The sale last year by Unilever of its tea brands shows how unsentimental companies can be. While the past is known, the future can only be read in the tea leaves.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on a swill idea: that history was made in a tea break | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/27/the-guardian-view-on-a-swill-idea-that-history-was-made-in-a-tea-break
2/28/2022,"Ukrainian officials have published dozens of videos of what they say are captured Russian soldiers, as the brutal fighting in Ukraine enters its fourth day. In one of the videos, published early on Sunday morning on the Telegram channel Find Your Own set up by Ukraine’s interior ministry, a visibly injured soldier identifies himself as Leonid Paktishev, commander of a sniper’s unit based in the Rostov region. The Telegram channel, which first went live on Saturday, has so far posted numerous videos and photos showing captured Russian troops, which have led to an outcry from their families who say they were shocked to find out about the involvement of their loved ones in the invasion of Ukraine. The Guardian spoke to three family members who confirmed the identity of Paktishev and said they were shocked and angry when they found out after seeing the video that their loved one had been captured. “I was sent the video of my brother captured at 2am last night. I was completely shocked. I had no idea that he was fighting in there,” said Yelena Polivtseva, the sister of Paktishev. In the video, Paktishev, from the small town of Mezdhurechenskiy in western Siberia, said he led a team of three other snipers. “I knew Leonid was in the military, but I had no idea that he was sent to Ukraine. I don’t think he would have been aware of it either,” said Polivtseva, who went by her maiden name. Russia has so far not commented on the videos released and has revealed very little information about the state of its soldiers fighting in Ukraine. The Russian ministry of defence on Sunday evening for the first time admitted that there were “dead and wounded soldiers amongst our comrade[s]”, but added that “the number of destroyed [Ukrainian] nationalists by far outweigh” the number of Russian casualties. Asked about her brother’s involvement in Russia’s unprovoked invasion into Ukraine, Polivtseva said she was not “competent” to judge the decision of our “commander-in-chief”. But she said she hoped the fighting would end. “No one needs this, not Ukraine and not Russia. I believe we can come to an agreement through peaceful means so that our sons, brothers and husbands don’t die.” Polivtseva said she last talked to her brother during the new year’s holiday. She had also sent him a birthday message on social media on Thursday, the day when the invasion started and he turned 28. “I saw he was not online and got a bit worried then. Now am so so worried, I haven’t slept all night, my children are crying, our mother is in a critical state.” Ukraine has been urging Russian family members to contact them about the captured soldiers, and called on their family to express their opposition to the country’s involvement in the war. The Ukrainian ministry of defence set up a hotline for the family members of Russian soldiers called Come Back Alive from Ukraine. According to the Kyiv Independent, the hotline had received “hundreds of calls” since the start of the invasion. Another close family member of Paktishev, who asked for his name not to be used, expressed anger over the relative’s involvement in the war in Ukraine. “How else can you feel?! Young boys are thrown like cannon fodder, and most importantly for what?! For palaces in Gelendzhik?,” the family member said, referring to the palatial mansion on the Black Sea that Russian independent journalists have said is linked to Vladimir Putin. The family member said he received an overnight message on their Vkontakte social media page informing them about the capture, with the video that was circulating online attached. The message, seen by the Guardian said: “Good evening, I would like to say hi from the Ukrainian people. I would like to make you happy that a close person to you is still alive. Go out and protest, overthrow your government before we bury all in Ukrainian soil. Be damned and burn in hell. Glory to Ukraine,” Dmitry Selyanin, a third relative of Paktishev the Guardian spoke to, said he has been in a state of disbelief ever since he found out about his cousin’s capture. “He is a sniper and snipers aren’t loved by the enemy. In the video we don’t get to see the other snipers in his group, we don’t know what happened to them. So we can only guess what they will do to Leonid,” he said. Selyanin said the family has been approached by the Russian authorities this afternoon. “They asked for some of the details about him, nothing special,” he said. Other reports also detailed the surprise of family members of Russian soldiers about the involvement of their loved ones in a war that has been met with deep unease by many in the country. On Saturday the independent TV channel Dozdh published an interview in which a visibly distressed father of a young Russian soldier said he did not want his son to become “cannon fodder,” denying he had any prior knowledge of his son’s involvement in Ukraine. The Find Your Own Telegram channel also published a number of graphic photographs of what was said to be Russian troops killed in action. If confirmed, the images appear to shine a light on the true toll the war has had on the Russian army. An adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Saturday that about 3,500 Russian soldiers had been killed or injured so far in Russia’s attack on Ukraine. On Saturday evening, Zelenskiy announced that Ukrainian and Russian delegations were planning to meet, news that was welcomed by Paktishev’s family, who are desperate to see him again. “Do you think there is a chance I will see him alive?” his sister Yelena asked.",News/World news,Ukrainian officials upload videos of captured Russian soldiers on Telegram,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/27/ukrainian-officials-upload-videos-of-captured-russian-soldiers-on-telegram
2/28/2022,"The supreme court nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson should be placed “beyond politics”, the politician who extracted Joe Biden’s politically priceless promise to instal the first Black woman on the court said on Sunday. Biden introduced Jackson as his pick to replace the retiring Stephen Breyer this week. Some Republicans have complained that nominations should not be made on grounds of race or gender – ignoring promises to put women on the court acted on by Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump. Others have complained about how Democrats treated one of Trump’s nominees, Brett Kavanaugh, who denied allegations of sexual assault. Others have objected on ideological grounds, for example Lindsey Graham, a member of the Senate judiciary committee, claiming the Jackson nomination was the work of the “radical left”. James Clyburn, the South Carolina congressman and House Democratic whip whose endorsement both propelled Biden to the presidential nomination and produced his promise to pick a Black woman, appeared on Sunday on CBS’s Face the Nation. He said: “This is beyond politics. This is about the country, our pursuit of a more perfect union, and this is demonstrative of another step in that pursuit.” Of 115 supreme court justices, 108 have been white men. Two have been Black men, five women. As well as being the first Black woman on the court, Jackson would be the fourth woman on the current nine-justice panel, joining liberals Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor and Amy Coney Barrett, a hardline conservative. Clyburn said he hoped “that all my Republican friends will look upon” the nomination of Jackson as being “beyond politics”. “Let’s have a debate,” he said. “Let’s talk to her about her rulings and about her philosophy. But in the final analysis, let’s have a strong bipartisan support to demonstrate that both parties are still in pursuit of perfection”. No supreme court nomination – or, most observers would argue, hearing or ruling – is ever above politics. If confirmed, Jackson will not alter the balance of a court tilted 6-3 to conservatives by Republican political hardball which gave Trump three picks. Before Biden made his decision, Clyburn and Republicans including Graham and the other South Carolina senator, Tim Scott, championed J Michelle Childs, a judge from their state. Clyburn said it would be important to instal a justice who did not go to Yale or Harvard. Jackson went to Harvard. “It’s more traditional, no question about that,” Clyburn told CBS. “This means that we will continue that tradition, and I am one, as you can see, that’s not so much for tradition. I want to see us break as much new ground as possible. “But … in the final analysis, I think this is a good choice. It was a choice that brings on to the court a background and some experiences that nobody else on the court will have. And I think when you look at not just [Jackson’s] background in the family, life, but also her profession, she was a public defender. That adds a new perspective to the court.” Steve Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas, has pointed out that Jackson has more trial experience than four current justices combined – including the chief, John Roberts. Clyburn also said a successful confirmation process could help Biden politically with Black voters facing difficulties familiar to most Americans, particularly inflation. “When you have an opportunity to make an appointment like you just had,” he said, “and he made an African American appointment, I guarantee you, you see some of that move up. It may not move up with the people who are having income problems, but it will move up to those who have other reservations about the president.” Last year, Jackson was confirmed to the court of appeals for the DC circuit with support from three Republican senators: Graham, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski from Alaska. This year, Democrats will be able to confirm Jackson simply by keeping their 50 votes together and using Kamala Harris’s casting vote as vice-president. But on Sunday Mitt Romney of Utah told CNN’s State of the Union he could vote to confirm Jackson. “Yes,” the former presidential nominee said, “I’m going to take a very deep dive and had the occasion to speak with her about some of the concerns when she was before the Senate to go on to the circuit court. “Look, her nomination and her confirmation would or will be historic. And like anyone nominated by the president of the United States, she deserves a very careful look, a very deep dive. And I will provide fresh eyes to that evaluation, and hope that I will be able to support her in the final analysis.”",News/US news,Clyburn: supreme court nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson ‘beyond politics’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/27/clyburn-supreme-court-nomination-ketanji-brown-jackson-beyond-politics
2/28/2022,"At the ticket windows in the railway station in Lviv in western Ukraine, 60 kilometres from the Polish border, there are two kinds of tickets for the refugees wanting to flee the violence of the Russian invasion. First, the free tickets for the evacuation trains. The catch is, these are almost impossible to get. The alternative is a ticket for the regular service. The catch this time is that tickets are unavailable until well into March. And even then, men of military age are not allowed travel. Standing on his own is 43-year-old Alexei Lutaev, a building site manager from Dnipro. He is waiting to get tickets for a train to Poland for his 16-year-old son, who is waiting in a car nearby with his wife. “I can’t go myself because I am an able-bodied man and I’m not allowed to leave, Lutaev said. “My son is going to school in Poland anyway but we want to get him on the train. And my wife won’t leave if I can’t go. So we are staying. But I have faith that the Ukrainian army can defend us.” Otherwise, he says, he would do anything to get across the border. “I was in Berdyansk [a town next to Mariupol on the Sea of Azov] when it started. I heard the Russian air strikes and I decided to go straight home to Dnipro to pick up my family.” People in the crowded ticket hall are sitting wherever there was space. Some are sleeping on the floor. Most, however, are jostling at ticket windows where there are few tickets to be had. In the queue is Tony Frazier from Tampa, Florida, who flew to Kyiv a week before the invasion to pick up his Ukrainian wife. He says he has seen a ticket available for 4 March. “We knew something could happen,” he says. “It was horrible. When the explosions started in Kyiv, we rushed to the station. Everyone was fighting to get on a train, pushing women over to escape. We changed trains in Zhitomyr [to the west of Kyiv], where we had the same fight to get another train. It has been terrible but there isn’t any choice.” He says the US embassy told him it could help them, but first they had to get across the border. Crowds block the stairways to the platforms, where people are standing five deep. As the last three passengers squeeze on to the train to Uzhgorod, south of Lviv near the Hungarian border; the conductor tells everyone else on the platform that the train is full. He is met with desperate appeals. The train pulls away to reveal bags and a broken pram lying by the tracks. Waiting outside the station on Sunday is Yulia Anosova, 30, who works for a women’s rights organisation and escaped from Kyiv on an evacuation train with only her laptop, documents and a change of clothes. “I’m trying to get to Poland,” she says. “I know people there who can put me up. I left on the 25th on an evacuation train from Kyiv but it was really overcrowded. I had to stand all the way for eight hours.” Anosova lives on the outskirts of Kyiv near the Hostomel airbase, where there was heavy fighting late last week. “I stayed for 27 hours,” she says. “There were no sirens to warn what was about to happen, only the explosions happening. I went down to the shelter several times during the night then I decided I should leave.” As she is speaking, a man walks through the crowd touting a car to go the border. Almost instantly a family with young children disappear with him. The UN estimates that 368,000 people have already fled from Ukraine into neighbouring countries in recent days, and for many the train remains the most reliable escape route, not least to Przemyśl, the first station in Poland across the border. The scale of the movement of people, both inside Ukraine and over its borders, is already huge. “Heartfelt thanks to the governments and people of countries keeping their borders open and welcoming refugees,” said Filippo Grandi, the head of the UN refugee agency as he warned that “many more” Ukrainians were moving toward the borders. What is less clear is how many more are displaced internally. “Displacement in Ukraine is also growing, but the military situation makes it difficult to estimate numbers and provide aid,” he said. While some have crossed to Hungary, the majority of those escaping have left for Poland, which is allowing anyone from Ukraine to enter, even those without valid passports. It estimates that it could host 1.5 million Ukrainians in a worst-case scenario. The alternative to the train, for those with access to a car, is a queue of two days or more to leave via the Medyka border crossing. Failing that, people are required to walk five kilometres from a taxi drop-off point near the border, carrying luggage, children and even pets. It is a prospect that is too much for many. The situation is particularly difficult for the many foreigners who had come to Ukraine to work and study. Desmond Alfred, a 23-year-old student from Nigeria, was studying medicine in Odessa. “Originally we were supposed to be taken by bus to Moldova,” he says. “But that got cancelled so we made our way here. The Nigerian embassy will help us when we cross, but until then I have no money.”",News/World news,‘It’s been terrible’: the plight of Ukrainians hoping to reach safety,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/27/its-been-terrible-the-plight-of-ukrainians-hoping-to-reach-safety
2/28/2022,"Jonathan Freedland (We’re appalled by Putin now, but be clear: the west gave him the green light, 25 February) makes the important point about Russian nuclear strategy: that it is integrated into its military doctrine with little, if any, reference to a firebreak between a nuclear and conventional escalation. This has been so since the mid-1960s, when both east and west were grappling with the rapid expansion of strategic and the more ambitious tactical nuclear weapons. Western strategists tended to look for ways of deterring an adversary. This led to complex theories of controlled escalation, known as flexible response – still the central principle of Nato doctrine. At its core, Nato would seek to respond appropriately to a level of Soviet/Russian aggression. How all of the supposed signalling in the middle of a hot and dynamic war was supposed to work was often glossed over. Soviet, and now Russian, concepts of warfare are different. You prevent a war by demonstrating or convincing a potential opponent that your armies will prevail. This implies that if impeded or resisted the application of military force will be rapidly intensified. The nuclear option is thus readily at hand and shown to be so. Deterrence against an attack is insured by promising defeat. A crucial distinction from mutual assured destruction.Prof Keith HaywardLondon  Jonathan Freedland is right about the green light but not its cause. Invasion and war have become the accepted method by which major states impose their will on weaker ones. They are no longer a last resort when diplomatic efforts fail, but an accepted first resort, with the UN providing a convenient fig leaf to give spurious legality to some invasions and not others. We now live in a world in which sovereign states are no longer protected by an international system of rule. The UN principle of the right of states to self-determination as set out in international law has been completely superceded by the right to invade by the powerful. As in every war, it’s always the civilians and military personnel who pay with their lives, not the politicians who too easily pick invasion and war, not diplomacy and peace.Peter HallBarnburgh, Doncaster  Russia’s aggression against Ukraine exposes the extraordinary failure of the UN security council to live up to its primary responsibility to maintain international peace and security. When, in 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait, the security council was swift to act and adopt resolution 678, which authorised the use of “all necessary means” to halt that aggression and restore peace. The USSR representative at the time stated that “those who had breached the peace should know that all necessary means would indeed inexorably be used against them”. Of course, the situation is different today. The peace was broken by one of the permanent members of the security council, which are able to abuse their privileges and treat this body with disdain. Indeed, as reported in your article Moment that Putin thundered to war, drowning out last entreaties for peace, 24 February), Putin announced the start of Russia’s “special military operation” while an emergency session of the security council was under way. What we are witnessing here is not just a flagrant breach of international law but also a stark sense of resignation on the part of the other permanent members of the security council with respect to Ukraine’s occupation.Dr Aldo Zammit BordaReader in law, The City Law School, City, University of London  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
