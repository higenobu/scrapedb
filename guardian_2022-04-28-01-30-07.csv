The contempt order was issued in the civil investigation by New York state attorney Letitia James into the former president’s business practices. On 7 April, James asked judge Arthur Engoron to hold Trump in contempt of court for not turning over documents and information she had subpoenaed as part of the investigation. Trump had promised to comply “in full” by 31 March, but did not, James said. Engoron granted James’s request, fining him $10,000 a day. James’ inquiry has been focused on whether the Trump Organization provided incorrect real estate valuation, both to secure favorable loans as well as tax deductions. She recently stated the the office’ had uncovered “significant evidence” of wrongdoing.

4/28/2022,"Lowering food tariffs will not solve the cost of living crisis and it would be “misleading” to suggest as much to consumers, the president of the farmers’ union said after reports ministers were considering slashing import taxes. Minette Batters, the president of the National Farmers’ Union (NFU), which represents the interests of 55,000 food producers in England and Wales, said lowering the tariff wall for imported foods “does not even begin to deal with the problem” of soaring grocery prices. The cabinet is debating whether to lower tariffs on foods such as oranges and rice, which are difficult to produce in the UK, as a way of bringing prices down. Ministers including Boris Johnson are pushing to slash import tariffs, the Sun reported on Monday, as a way to help families manage rocketing inflation. Prices of food and non-alcoholic drinks rose by 5.9% in the year to mid-March, according to official figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). However, other cabinet members including the international trade secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, are thought to oppose such plans, believing the UK’s decision to unilaterally cut tariffs would disadvantage it when negotiating post-Brexit trade deals. “We have got the third most affordable food here in the world and with the retail price war that’s going on we have probably got the most affordable,” Batters told journalists, adding that she did not believe lower food prices would be sustainable. The conflict in Ukraine – a key producer of wheat and sunflower oil – is fuelling fears about worldwide food shortages. Batters said: “It is about making sure that everybody keeps producing what they are good at so we don’t drive shortages in availability, as that will just drive further inflation. “Just lowering the tariff wall does not even begin to deal with the problem. It is a very complex problem that needs long-term strategy put in place to deal with the short-, medium- and long-term. “It is misleading to consumers to just think ‘lower the tariff wall’ and that sorts the issue.”Batters was speaking as the NFU outlined its plans to increase the UK’s agri-food exports by 30% by 2030, to bring the total value to more than £30bn, by finding ways for farmers to sell their produce to more overseas markets. The NFU is calling on government to work “in partnership” with food producers to target new export markets as ministers tour the world negotiating free trade deals, highlighting how the industry works with ministers in other countries such as Australia, where farmers are included in trade missions. Batters has previously criticised the government’s “adversarial” approach when dealing with farmers, and accused ministers of using food producers as a “pawn” in post-Brexit trade deals with large food-producing nations Australia and New Zealand. Farmers have raised concerns that free trade agreements could lead to a surge in cheaply-produced imports flooding the UK market, leaving them unable to compete.",News/Business,"Slashing food tariffs will not fix UK’s cost of living crisis, warns farmers’ union",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/27/food-tariffs-uk-cost-of-living-crisis-farmers-union-import-taxes-inflation

4/28/2022,"Researchers using AI technologies have discovered that male characters are four times more prevalent in literature than female characters. Mayank Kejriwal at the University of Southern California’s Viterbi School of Engineering was inspired by work on gender biases and his own work on natural language processing to carry out the experiment. Kejriwal and fellow researcher Akarsh Nagaraj used data from 3,000 books that are part of the Gutenberg Project, across genres including adventure, science fiction, mystery and romance. The study used Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify gender-specific characters by looking at things including female and male pronouns. The researchers also examined how many female characters were main characters. “Gender bias is very real, and when we see females four times less in literature, it has a subliminal impact on people consuming the culture,” said Kejriwal. “We quantitatively revealed an indirect way in which bias persists in culture.” But the researchers did face difficulties with those who didn’t fit into a gender binary. The AI was unable to figure out if “they” referred to a plural or a “non-dichotomous individual”. Kejriwal said: “When we published the dataset paper, reviewers had this criticism that we were ignoring non-dichotomous genders. But we agreed with them, in a way. We think it’s completely suppressed, and we won’t be able to find many [transgender individuals or non-dichotomous individuals].” As well as the statistics on male and female characters, the researchers also looked at the language associated with gender-specific characters. Nagaraj said: “Even with misattributions, the words associated with women were adjectives like ‘weak’, ‘amiable’, ‘pretty’ and sometimes ‘stupid’. For male characters, the words describing them included ‘leadership’, ‘power’, ‘strength’ and ‘politics’.” Kejriwal added: “Our study shows us that the real world is complex but there are benefits to all different groups in our society participating in the cultural discourse. When we do that, there tends to be a more realistic view of society.”",Arts/Books,"Four times more male characters in literature than female, research suggests",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/27/four-times-more-male-characters-in-literature-than-female-research-suggests
4/28/2022,"A former head of the Polish army has accused Boris Johnson of “tempting evil” by revealing that Ukrainian soldiers were being trained in Poland in how to use British anti-aircraft missiles before returning with them to Ukraine. Gen Waldemar Skrzypczak, also a former junior defence minister, complained that a loose-lipped prime minister had revealed too much to the Russians and that his remarks risked the safety of the soldiers involved. Speaking to Polish tabloid Fakt, Skrzypczak said that Johnson had revealed “a military secret” and that “bad words are on the lips” when he gave details of the Ukrainian training plan on a trip to India last week. “Military training is a matter of the army, in such a situation secret. Let a man restrain himself and think before he says such things,” said the former general to the newspaper, which described his tone as irritated in an article from Friday. “The prime minister may not be aware of it, but with such statements he puts the success of the entire military operation at risk, as well as the safety of the soldiers,” Skrzypczak said. “Such statements are tempting evil.” On the visit, Johnson had revealed that Ukrainians were being taught how to use Nato-standard weapons in both Poland and the UK. “I can say that we are currently training Ukrainians in Poland in the use of anti-aircraft defence, and actually in the UK in the use of armoured vehicles,” he said. British forces in Poland are training the Ukrainian military in using the Starstreak air defence missile systems. It is likely to be a few weeks before they can be deployed on the frontline to target Russian helicopters and aircraft. Russia has become irritated by the west’s increased supply of weapons to Ukraine, after its unprovoked invasion of the country two months ago. Earlier this week, Sergei Lavrov, Russian’s foreign minister, accused Nato of being “engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy”. Lavrov added that weapons supplied by western countries “will be a legitimate target” and that Russian forces had already hit weapons warehouses in western Ukraine. But, despite the threats, it is not thought likely that Russia would seek to target them within Nato countries for fear of retaliation. Western countries deny that Nato has become a party to the conflict. A western official said on Wednesday: “There is a Russian narrative that this is a proxy war between Russia and Nato. It isn’t.” He added: “We are entitled to provide military support to any state exercising its right to self-defence.” Skrzypczak said he was concerned about how much detail Johnson had been prepared to go into. “It is hard to imagine that when we were on missions abroad, one of the politicians would talk about our plans or training on television.”",News/Politics,Boris Johnson ‘tempting evil’ by revealing Ukrainian soldiers trained in Poland,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/27/boris-johnson-tempting-evil-revealing-ukrainian-soldiers-trained-poland
4/28/2022,"Mimi Reinhard, who has died aged 107, was a prisoner at the Płaszów Nazi labour camp in a suburb of Kraków in Poland when in 1944 she was asked to help out with the preparation of a document for the camp commander Amon Göth. It was a list of people in the camp who would be sent to work in a munitions factory owned by an industrialist called Oskar Schindler, where they would be housed in barracks, away from the extreme cruelty of the camp. The list that Reinhard helped to compile, and typed up, later became known as Schindler’s list. After the war, Reinhard settled for a time in Morocco and then New York, where she lived for 50 years. She kept in touch with other “Schindler Jews” whose lives had been saved by escaping the Plaszów camp under Schindler’s protection, but did not speak publicly about her earlier life until she moved to Israel in 2007. In the meantime, Schindler’s story was told first in Thomas Keneally’s 1982 novel, Schindler’s Ark, which won the Booker prize, and in 1993 in a film by Steven Spielberg, Schindler’s List, which won seven Oscars and reached a huge audience worldwide. Mimi was born Carmen Koppel in Vienna, daughter of Frieda and Emil Koppel. Her father, an opera-loving grain merchant, chose her name after Bizet’s Carmen, but she did not like it and was nicknamed Mimi (after the character La Bohème). She studied languages at the University of Vienna, taking shorthand to help with her note-taking. In 1936 she married Josef Weitmann, who owned a curtain-making business in Kraków, and the couple settled there and had a son, Sascha. After the German occupation of Poland in 1939, the administration wanted to re-establish Kraków as Krakau, a German city. As Jews, Mimi and her husband were forced to live in the Kraków ghetto, established by the Nazis in 1940. Its inhabitants were allowed to leave and return only with special permits. Josef was killed while trying to escape; Sascha was smuggled to relatives in Hungary. Mimi survived the final liquidation of the Kraków ghetto in March 1943, when 2,000 Jews were slaughtered, because the Nazis deemed her language and secretarial skills useful. She was transported to the Płaszów forced labour camp. “My mother had insisted that I learn something useful,” she said in an interview in 2007. “In the camp there were not so many people who spoke German and could do shorthand and type, so I was put into the administrative barracks.” Schindler was a Nazi party member, former intelligence agent and businessman who ran enamelware and later ammunition factories. He mixed with the German elite of Kraków, initially hoping to further his interests, but did not go along with the Nazi treatment of the Poles, the Jews and the other subject peoples. He gained a reputation for being more civilised than others in his treatment of his Jewish workers, and as time went on devoted his resources to protecting them. He had asked Göth for workers for his factories – he was ready to offer bribes and Göth was willing take them. But in March 1943, Göth’s secretary, Mietek Pemper, sent a letter to Schindler informing him that s tricter regulations meant his workers could no longer be allowed to walk the two and a half miles from the camp to his factory. Schindler won permission to build a new factory further away in Brünnlitz in the Sudetenland (now Brněnec in the Czech Republic) and barracks where the workers could stay. Pemper was then tasked with compiling the list of those who would travel to Brünnlitz. Working with him as an administrator, Mimi helped with the list. “When the Germans came with Schindler’s list of the workers that he wanted to take to Sudetenland it was given to me to note and type up … I put my name and the name of two friends on it to make up the quota.” On the way to Brünnlitz in 1944, the train carrying Schindler’s workers was diverted to Auschwitz. Death seemed inevitable. But Schindler used his military intelligence contacts to stop the diversion, claiming that these workers were vital for his armaments factory. At its peak, the factory employed about 1,750 workers, of whom 1,000 were Jews. Mimi was put to work in Schindler’s office. At the war’s end, his workers were liberated, and Mimi was reunited with Sascha. She married Albert Reinhard, a hotel director, and they settled in New York and had a daughter, Lucienne. She met Schindler again just once, on a trip to Vienna in the early 1950s. “We were passing a coffee house where there was a group of people sitting. This large man ran across and hugged and started kissing me, saying: ‘Mimi, Mimi ...’ It was then that I realised that it was Schindler sitting with some of the Jews he had rescued.” Lucienne died in 2000, and Albert in 2002. Five years later, when planning to move to Israel, where her son was a sociology professor, Mimi was interviewed by members of a Jewish resettlement agency about her wartime experiences. It was only then that her connection to Schindler became more widely known. She is survived by Sascha and by three granddaughters, nine great-grandchildren and two great-great-grandchildren.

4/28/2022,"A Florida judge has ordered a man who defaced an LGBTQ+ Pride mural to write a 25-page essay about the 2016 Pulse gay nightclub shooting. Last June, the city of Delray Beach in south Florida unveiled a rainbow mural at an intersection on the fifth anniversary of the attack, in which a gunman killed 49 people at the club in Orlando. A few days later, police noticed “tire skid marks” that were “approximately 15 feet across the painting”, according to an affidavit. Cellphone footage sent to authorities showed then 19-year-old Alexander Jerich driving towards the intersection in a white pickup truck with a Donald Trump flag draped over it. According to the police, he had attended a 30-car rally for the former president’s birthday on 14 June. “The video clearly shows a white Chevy truck stopped at the intersection, and then intentionally accelerated the vehicle in an unreasonable unsafe manner in a short amount of time … The Chevy truck continues to recklessly skid sideways,” the affidavit said. “The video shows that the driver willfully drove the vehicle with disregard for the safety of any other persons or property.” Using the license plate captured in the video, police located Jerich, who agreed to turn himself in. He pleaded guilty to charges of criminal mischief and reckless driving, and agreed to pay $2,003 to repair the mural. During a hearing last Thursday, Jerich hung his head, cried and apologized for his actions but did not offer any real explanation for them, according to the Palm Beach Post. “I’ve had problems in the past with fitting in,” he said, adding: “I was just trying to fit in and be accepted.” Rand Hoch, the president of the Palm Beach County Human Rights Council, a local LGBTQ+ rights group, pushed for a year-long sentence for Jerich. But circuit judge Scott Suskauer appeared to be taken by surprise by Jerich’s personality, saying: “I was expecting someone who displays complete disrespect for their fellow citizens … A person some might call a thug or a redneck. “This is not the person I was expecting.” He said needed more time to decide on a punishment. In the meantime, he ordered Jerich to write a 25-page essay on the 2016 nightclub massacre in Orlando, asking him to research the backgrounds of the victims and their loved ones. “I want your own brief summary of why people are so hateful and why people lash out against the gay community,” Suskauer told Jerich, ordering him to return to court on 8 June for his sentencing. Suskauer also asked him to perform community services with LGBTQ+ organizations. However, according to Hoch, none of the groups he is affiliated with are interested in working with Jerich. “They don’t want the defendant anywhere near our organization or our missions,” he said. Suskauer said he may also order Jerich to visit the intersection every week alongside his father to keep it clean.",News/US news,Judge orders man who defaced Pride mural to write essay on Pulse shooting,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/27/pulse-essay-lgbtq-mural-defaced-florida
4/28/2022,"An H3N8 strain of bird flu has been detected in humans for the first time, in China’s central province of Henan.The four-year-old boy infected had been in contact with chickens and crows raised at his home, according to reports from China’s National Health Commission.Avian influenza or bird flu as it is commonly known is a highly contagious viral disease with the first reports of human cases in the 1990s. Some strains of the bird flu, such as with H3N8 now, have been passed to humans but this is currently very rare, and usually occurs after very close contact with infected birds or animals.H3N8 viruses circulate widely in birds and in horses and have also been detected in dogs in North America.“We often see a virus spread to a human and then not spread any further so a single case is not a cause of great concern,” said Sir Peter Horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases and global health, University of Oxford.“There is no reason to think it will go any further,” said Prof Paul Digard from the Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, adding that Chinese authorities had not reported any illness in the immediate contacts of the infected boy.However, Horby and other disease experts said the widespread transmission and record number of outbreaks of avian flu in birds across the UK, US and Europe this year was a cause of concern as it increased the opportunity for avian viruses to mix and mutate and for human infection.“I do generally believe we need to be increasing influence surveillance globally quite concertedly right now. Apart from H3N8, we have seen a number of other new spillover events of influenza from poultry to people over recent years including H5N8 in Russia and H7N9 and H10N3 in China,” said Alexandra Phelan, assistant professor at the centre for global health science and security at Georgetown University. Marius Gilbert, an epidemiologist at the Université Libre de Bruxelles in Belgium, said a novel virus should always be looked at very carefully, “especially when it is a reassortant, as it can have unpredictable capacity in terms of transmission and virulence in human population”.Dr John McCauley, from the World Health Organization collaborating centre for reference and research on influenza, said the case was an “unusual one” and was being investigated by the WHO and its counterparts in the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.In the UK, consumers can no longer buy free-range eggs, with birds not having been allowed outdoors since November due to close to 100 outbreaks of avian flu. However, there have been fewer than five cases of transmission from an infected bird to a human recorded in the UK – most recently in January, when a man caught it from ducks he kept inside his home.

4/28/2022,"Jimmy Kimmel acknowledged Melania Trump’s 52nd birthday on Tuesday evening. “Birthdays are tough for Melania – she’s made the same wish for the past 20 years, never comes true,” he joked. “The tears keep extinguishing the candles before she can blow them out. “I don’t know what kind of gift Trump gave her, but he did send her a beautiful email today that started ‘dear supporter,’” Kimmel added. “Birthdays are depressing for a lot of people. Can you imagine being Melania? Every year they sing happy birthday, then she spends the next 10 minutes watching the gibbon she married wolf down a whole cake.” Kimmel also ragged on Donald Trump’s app Truth Social, “which is such a disaster he himself hasn’t even posted on it for 11 weeks”. Though he will probably be allowed to return to Twitter under Elon Musk, who bought the company for $44bn this week, Trump has said he will not go back to the bird app. (His account was banned after the 6 January attack on the Capitol.) But “he 100% will go back on Twitter”, Kimmel predicted. “And then this dumb new company he conned everybody out of their money for will become, I guess, the social media equivalent of a RadioShack.” “A RadioShack that is run by Devin Nunes,” he added of the former California congressman, who claimed on Fox News that Truth Social has gotten more engagement than both Twitter and Instagram. “‘Engagement’ means the four people who are on it have been liking each other’s posts.” Dr Deborah Birx, the former White House Covid response coordinator to Trump, has published a tell-all book called Silent Invasion: The Untold Story of the Trump Administration, Covid-19, and Preventing the Next Pandemic Before It’s Too Late. “Which is a lot of words for someone who never spoke up at all,” said Kimmel. In the book, Birx calls the press conference in which Trump advised Americans to drink bleach as a Covid treatment a “tragedy”. “It’s amazing – all it took for the people to finally say something was an advance from a book publisher,” Kimmel mused. Truth Social: it’s ""competition"" for Twitter the same way that guy on the plane was ""competition"" for Mike Tyson. pic.twitter.com/0chPdUpyz4 On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah also mocked Truth Social, which has “so far been a total bust”, with 500,000 daily users. “To put it in perspective, Twitter, the thing that it’s supposed to be replacing, has 217 million daily users,” Noah said. “So Truth Social is ‘competition’ for Twitter the same way that guy on the plane was ‘competition’ for Mike Tyson.” Trump has posted on Truth Social just one time, for its launch two months ago. “Think about how crazy that is!” Noah exclaimed. “People, when he was on Twitter, Trump would send, what, 50 tweets every time he went to the bathroom. But now? He hasn’t posted in two months? I’m just saying, man, someone needs to get this guy some prune juice stat.” Noah also cited reports that a lot of Republicans would be secretly thrilled if Trump never returned to Twitter, “because they don’t like the drama that he would create”, Noah said. “And it makes sense. You remember what it was like when he was on Twitter – he would say something, he would tweet something random like ‘Congress should make it illegal to speak Spanish,’ and then all day reporters would be tracking down Republican senators in the hallway. Remember, they’d chase them and be like ‘do you agree with the president that it should be illegal to speak Spanish?’ And the senators would have to come up with new ways to answer without answering.” “I’ll be honest, though,” Noah concluded. “The only reason I would want Trump back on Twitter – the only reason – is because I know, yes, it would probably lead to another term and it would destroy the country, but I just really want to see his Wordle scores.” And on Late Night, Seth Meyers recapped former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s endorsement of Musk’s purchase of Twitter, saying he supported Musk’s “mission to extend the light of consciousness”. “Well, I feel a lot better knowing that Twitter wasn’t in great hands before,” said Meyers. In other news, Joe Biden said he had tried to congratulate Emmanuel Macron for his recent election victory, but couldn’t reach him because the French president was “at the Eiffel Tower having a good time”. “Oof, that’s gotta hurt.

4/28/2022,"A survivor of the Rotherham child abuse grooming scandal has condemned the Conservatives for appointing an MP who is now a convicted sex offender as an adviser on child exploitation after being questioned under caution. Sammy Woodhouse said it was “gut-wrenching” that her fellow contributor to a Home Office expert panel, Imran Ahmad Khan, had already been questioned by police about the assault of a 15-year-old boy when they served together on a Home Office panel. Khan was found guilty this month of molesting his victim, who told the court that the Conservative party had also been warned about the MP while he was standing for office but had taken no action. The Guardian disclosed Khan’s appointment to the panel on Tuesday. At prime minister’s questions, Boris Johnson refused to condemn the appointment of Khan. Woodhouse, who was 14 when she was groomed by a 24-year-old grooming gang leader, attended online meetings with Khan in 2020 following an invitation from the Home Office. She said she was disgusted by his role on the committee. “This was important work that I undertook in good faith, but I am disgusted to have been put in a position where I was working with a man later convicted for child sexual assault. “Knowing now that the Conservatives had already received complaints from a victim about this man, it is gut-wrenching for me as a survivor that they could possibly have allowed him to be considered for this role,” she said. Khan attended online meetings with the panel of sexual exploitation experts in July, September and November of 2020. Staffordshire police say he gave a written statement after being qustioned in May 2020 addressing claims he had assaulted a minor. Khan was elected in December 2019. A few days before the general election, his victim, then 24, called the Conservative party and told them about the abuse he had suffered at the hands of Khan, he told the court. The assault took place in January 2008 when Khan was 34 and prior to him becoming an MP. Khan tried to force the 15-year-old to drink alcohol before sexually assaulting him in a house in Staffordshire. The boy immediately told his parents about the sexual assault. After Khan had been elected as the MP for Wakefield, the victim decided to pursue the complaint as he was concerned that Khan was not fit to be in public office, he told the court. Staffordshire police launched an inquiry into Khan, sending him a questionnaire about the incident in line with Covid restrictions. Khan replied with a statement under caution in May 2020, a police spokesperson said. In the Commons, the MP for Manchester Withington, Jeff Smith, asked if Johnson would apologise for the failure of the Tories to take the allegations from Khan’s victim seriously. Johnson replied: “I believe the Home Office has already made a statement about it.” Khan was charged in 2021 and subsequently found guilty and has been warned he faces a jail sentence. He has said he will resign from his seat but so far he has not. Labour MP Louise Haigh has demanded that the home secretary, Priti Patel, and Johnson “come clean” on what the Conservative party knew about the reports of child sexual abuse against Khan. “Khan’s victim told the Conservatives about sickening sexual abuse, and they did nothing, and then shamefully appointed him to sit alongside survivors of child sexual exploitation.” “How could they possibly have put victims in this position?” A Conservative party spokesperson said on Tuesday: “We have found no record of this complaint.” A Home Office spokesperson said on Tuesday that neither Patel nor the Home Office were aware of the claims against Khan before they were made public in 2021. “In his role as an MP, Mr Khan was asked along with several others to peer review a Home Office research paper. The Home Office was not aware of the allegations against him at the time and he no longer has any involvement with the department.”",News/Politics,Rotherham abuse survivor condemns Tories over Imran Ahmad Khan role,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/27/rotherham-abuse-survivor-condemns-tories-over-imran-ahmad-khan-role
4/28/2022,"While tanks and troops exchange fire in Donbas, Ukraine faces another escalating battle on an invisible front line, one that may be equally crucial to determining the outcome of the war. Russia is stepping up attacks on infrastructure deep into western parts of the country that Moscow has admitted for now it cannot capture, striking targets that keep both the war effort and the national economy running, including the railway network, a critical bridge and fuel depots. The aim of Russian attacks is likely to slow the rapidly expanding delivery of weapons from Nato allies to the eastern front, while also hindering exports of grain and other commodities that help Kyiv pay for the war. With the country’s Black Sea ports are closed to shipping, overland routes are even more vital. “It is my opinion that they didn’t believe the west will give Ukraine the necessary heavy weapon supplies so now the process is started, they feel they need to do something about that,” said one Ukrainian military official monitoring the infrastructure attacks. “Because western weapons and Ukrainian combat experience combined give us a big advantage.” On Monday, five railway stations were hit by Russian missiles. The head of Ukraine’s railways company, Oleksandr Kamyshin, said it was the heaviest assault on his system since the war began. “The repair of all infrastructure damage will take months,” he acknowledged in a news conference. Fuel depots have been another regular target, along with a critical bridge that provides the only overland link on Ukrainian territory to the southern Bessarabia region. A spokesman for Ukraine’s defence staff said infrastructure was being hit to stop western arms shipments. “Russians are attacking military and civilian infrastructure to prevent getting weapons from our partners,” Oleksandr Shtupun told a press conference. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said in a broadcast on state TV: “These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military. Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once. How can it be otherwise?” It is not a one-sided battle. A series of destructive explosions and fires at strategic locations inside Russian territory and neighbouring Belarus – fuel depots and railways – are widely considered the work of Ukrainian forces, although none have been claimed officially by Kyiv. In the early weeks of the war, Ukrainian forces were highly effective at damaging Russian logistics in areas that were contested or recently seized. But in this round of attacks both countries are targeting infrastructure deep inside enemy-held territory. Senior presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak in a tweet about “self-destructing” Russian infrastructure appeared to hint broadly at his country’s role; on the list of destroyed assets he gave was the Moskva ship, widely acknowledged to have been sunk by a Ukrainian missile. “How can we not believe in karma for the murder of [Ukrainian] children? Many are still willing to turn a blind eye to financing terrorism by buying Russian oil. But should the European Union depend on a country where everything is self-destructing?” he said. The operations on Russian territory have often been bold and spectacular, boosting morale as much as hindering the enemy’s capacity. They include a daring helicopter raid on the border town of Belograd and Sunday night’s attack on oil storage facilities near a critical crude pipeline junction in Bryansk. The same night another blast near Bryansk took out a military rail spur used to bring rockets and other munitions from storage onto the main railway network, a Ukraine security source said. And a powerful radio control tower destroyed in Transnistria, part of Moldova controlled by Russian-backed separatists, was broadcasting propaganda across the region and may also have been used for military communications. The battle over infrastructure deep inside enemy-held territory is an area where Ukraine may be more vulnerable than Russia because of the size of the country, the extent of Russia’s military resources and the battle for the air. While not dominant in the skies, it is still easier for Russian planes, drones and helicopters to fly over Ukraine than the reverse and its own skies are largely open, while the government in Kyiv relies entirely on land transport for its military and economic lifelines. “Rail has always been important [in Ukraine] for exporting things like coal, grain and steel, but it no longer has access to sea ports so a lot more has been going by rail out of the country,” said Tracey German, professor in conflict and security at King’s College London. “So potentially this isn’t just a way of disrupting the military effort but also of putting pressure on the country economically.” Russians perhaps did not move strongly against these targets at the start of the war because President Vladimir Putin anticipated a quick victory and perhaps the Russian military thought they would be using the infrastructure themselves. They also expected to control the skies, which would have made it easier to deny access to roads and railways, said Niklas Masuhr at the Center for Security Studies thinktank in Switzerland. Now there are strong military incentives for a campaign behind front lines. “The focus has shifted towards the Donbas and there are two underlying drivers of attacks on infrastructure, particularly in western Ukraine. They are potentially trying more to cut off supplies into the Donbas, create a battle of attrition in that part of Ukraine.” “With strikes on Lviv and Kyiv they may also be trying to hit targets throughout the country, to force them to disperse air defence systems throughout the country, so they don’t have them where needed in the Donbas.” For Ukraine to win this battle, it needs more air defences for the west, in addition to the heavy weapons and short range air defence systems heading east, the Ukrainian military source said. “Ukraine on its own cannot protect any inch of its territory from the threat from the air, because Ukraine uses very old aerial defence systems,” the source said. “Britain is sending short-range things that work great in Donbas. But the strategic thing really necessary for Ukraine is heavy and long-range defence systems to close the skies over [relatively] peaceful areas of the country.”",News/World news, Russia attacks infrastructure in western Ukraine to slow supply lines ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/27/russia-attacks-infrastructure-western-ukraine-slow-supply-lines
