1/8/2022,"Henri Cartier-Bresson had a simple maxim about the craft that he had mastered so completely. “Your first 10,000 photographs are your worst,” he would tell fledgling snappers. And as the years roll on, I have begun to find comfort in his advice. I began wielding a camera a very long time ago and I reckon I am now approaching Cartier-Bresson’s magic quota. By his arithmetic, I will soon step off the lowest rung in the ladder of photography and progress to the next-to-worst ranking. Things can only get better. And I cannot deny I have taken many badly focused, clumsily framed images in my time. The blurred negatives in my files confirm that sad fact. However, as the years have passed, I have also managed a few decent photographs that have brought me a sense of fulfilment and, occasionally, the satisfaction of seeing my efforts in print. Mastering an acceptable image is a pleasing business, I have found.  Photography brings other rewards, of course. For a start, I now possess records of so many episodes of my life: from my early days as a hill-walker in Scotland, to the births of my children, and to my travels to distant lands on Observer assignments. It is a treasure trove of images that make my memories tangible, a pleasure that can now be achieved by anyone with a decent camera on their smartphones. These have made the business of record-sharing straightforward. There is more to photography than merely documenting the passage of one’s life, however. First, there is the simple physical satisfaction you get from learning how to master your camera – learning to balance film speed, aperture and shutter speed, for example. In this way, you can tailor the needs of your subject – be it a fast-moving animal or a moodily lit portrait or a landscape teeming with detail – to produce a striking image, one that is more than a simple record of an event. An understanding of these basics is essential and mastering them brings its own fulfilment. Seeking better and better images also brings a drive and a purpose to the way you use your spare time. This has been particularly true in recent years, when I have become increasingly keen to photograph UK wildlife, an urge that has taken me to parts of the British Isles that I might never have otherwise visited. My efforts to photograph the otter provides a good example. Frustrated at every attempt to get near one in England, I decided to visit a place that is notably replete with the species: Shetland. And after a long, initially frustrating day with a wildlife guide, I was rewarded with the sight of a solitary female cavorting near me on the seashore for more than half an hour. It was glorious. Then I had time to look at Shetland, a hauntingly beautiful place, I discovered, and came across the Broch of Mousa, one of Britain’s most remarkable buildings. Built 2,000 years ago, this towering iron age roundhouse – whose double lined stone walls contain an internal, curved stone staircases – is among Europe’s best preserved ancient buildings: a lowering, beautifully constructed monument that rises out of the mist and whose purpose defies precise historical explanation. For good measure, the island of Mousa has one of the world’s biggest colonies of European storm petrels and their chattering, staccato calls added an eerie soundtrack to my visit. Had I not chosen to tackle my first photographic goal, I would not have gone through this dazzling experience – and that is the real satisfaction I get from photography. It drives me on. Capturing wildlife in action is especially satisfying. Your subjects are utterly unpredictable, often infuriatingly so, but occasionally rewarding – when a recalcitrant bird of prey or an elusive dragonfly flits into your viewfinder at the right moment. From this perspective, photography is therapy, right down to capturing south London’s herons and cormorants – in Brockwell Park – and the woodpeckers that visited my garden in Brixton during lockdown last year. However, I should add a coda to this photographic panegyric. There are times when you should ignore the camera round your neck and just look at what is unfolding in front of you. I have been privileged to witness rocket launches in Florida, Kazakhstan and French Guiana and every time I photographed each spacecraft – from take-off to its disappearance into the upper atmosphere – in a frenzy of shutter clicking. I have some satisfactory images but it is only now that I realise that, just for once, I should have simply watched the whole breathtaking experience of humanity propelling its way towards the heavens without trying to capture it on film. So yes, take lots and lots of photographs but sometimes take a pause and just look. The break is worth it – now and then. The range of photography lessons available online is now so vast that you can be taught by the likes of Vanity Fair portrait photographer Annie Leibovitz or Vogue cover photographer Tyler Mitchell without leaving your sofa. Masterclass has a lot to answer for. If you want a less starry teacher, there are courses available from University of Arts London and the Photographer’s Gallery. Also look at the The Royal Photographic Society website which has lots of information about qualifications and training. Redeye is a not-for-profit society which offers advice and information to photographers around the world.",Arts/Art and design,A wild affair: develop a passion for photography and nature,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/08/a-wild-affair-develop-a-passion-for-photography-and-nature
1/8/2022,"It has already been described as the year of the squeeze, and whichever way you look at it, 2022 looks set to go down as the year that most of us became worse off. Increases in rail fares, phone bills, national insurance and mortgage repayments have all been announced, and energy bills could rocket if wholesale gas prices remain high and the government resists pressure to act. It will be a particular disaster for those on fixed incomes and benefits but even those on generous incomes are going to feel the heat. The next four months are crucial. Here’s what is heading your way.  If you think your domestic energy bills have gone up a lot in recent months, you had better prepare yourself for a shock. Bills could rise by another 50%, to as much as £2,000 a year on 1 April, for an average household paying by direct debit. Those in bigger properties, or working at home, people who live in the coldest parts of the country, and those who need to keep warm for medical reasons, could pay much more. A spate of energy supplier collapses and high wholesale gas prices have left the majority of UK homes paying gas and electricity tariffs capped by the regulator, Ofgem. Ofgem reviews the cap – the maximum amount it will allow suppliers to charge for each unit of gas and electricity – every six months. In early February, it will announce the new rates to be applied to bills from 1 April. All the indications are that prices will rise and the current cap equal to £1,277 a year for average use will rise to something closer to £2,000. That will mean savvy customers, who were on the best deals and paying as little as £1,000 a year last autumn, will have seen their energy bill double in a little over six months. High energy prices are going to make the biggest impact on most households’ disposable incomes this year – not least as they start to feed into the cost of other items. Businesses are facing even steeper increases and are not protected by the cap. This week, Boris Johnson appeared to rule out a temporary VAT removal. Currently, VAT is charged at 5% on energy bills and accounts for £65 per average bill, which would be closer to £100 after the cap is increased as expected. Winter fuel payments, paid to those born on or before 26 September 1955 and on some benefits, could be increased. These are currently worth between £100 and £300. The warm homes discount is worth £140 to those on certain benefits but is not available to customers of smaller suppliers. Households are already having to make their food budget go further, with the price of staples such as beef mince and crisps, as well as toiletries, rising fastest. Fresh increases are also in prospect as City analysts say struggling firms are eager to pass on higher costs now Christmas is over. Annual food price inflation reached 3.5% in December, adding almost £15 to the average monthly grocery bill, according to the data firm Kantar. Fraser McKevitt, its head of retail and consumer insight, said food prices rose sharply in the spring of 2020 when promotions were cut to maintain product availability but before that you would have to go back almost four years to January 2018 to see inflation running higher. Millions of people in England could face a double blow on 1 April as rising charges may go hand in hand with the over-60s being made to pay for the first time. In July last year, ministers proposed raising the qualifying age for free prescriptions in England from 60 to 66, thereby aligning the age for NHS prescription charge exemptions with the state pension age. No starting date has been announced but some have suggested it might come into effect in April. Campaigners say the move would result in 2.4 million more people paying prescription charges, with the average person in their early 60s paying £50 to £100 a year unless they qualify for another exemption. Prescription charges have risen every 1 April in recent years and currently stand at £9.35. The expectation is that they will rise again, probably by at least 20p. Normally a 3.8% increase in rail fares would lead to a huge outcry but this year the percentage increase looks relatively modest in comparison to some other price increases faced by consumers. The 1 March increase officially applies to regulated fares – such as season tickets, long-distance returns and anytime urban fares – in England alone but is likely to be reflected throughout UK rail. An annual five-day season ticket from Guildford in Surrey to London terminals currently costs £3,936, or £4,868 with tube travel thrown in. Anyone going back to the office full-time after March will pay £150 more, or £185 if they use the underground, too. A peak-time single from Bristol and Bath will rise by 33p to £9. This week, Virgin Media announced its customers will be paying an average of £56 a year more for their TV and broadband packages from March. The company has not published what the percentage increase is for TV and broadband bills but did admit its Virgin Mobile customers are facing increases of close to 10% on their airtime charges from April. What Virgin does is usually followed by companies such as Sky, TalkTalk and BT. BT customers who signed up or recontracted with BT after September 2020 can look forward to an annual price increase in line with inflation (January’s CPI figure) plus an additional 3.9%, which could turn out to be a rise of close to 10%. Last year, Sky increased its bills by an average of £36 a year up to a cap of £72. In the past, these firms have raised their tariffs on 1 April, now dubbed the UK’s price increase day. Tesco Mobile pay-monthly customers face a series of price increases from 9 February. Sending a picture message will go from 25p to 55p and calling countries such as Australia, South Africa and the US will go from 25p a minute to £1 a minute. Customers who use more than their monthly allowance will be charged 55p a minute (up from 25p), while listening to voicemails goes from 15p a minute to 55p and texts from 10p to 20p each. Don’t forget the return of roaming charges for those visiting Europe this year, courtesy of Brexit. A family of four all taking their phones to Spain for a week will pay £56. Borrowers who are on their lender’s standard variable rate (SVR) will see their monthly payments go up after the Bank of England’s decision to increase the base rate in December. Although not tied to the base rate, SVRs tend to move up in line with it, and this time is no exception – most of the UK’s biggest lenders have announced that from 1 February they will increase borrowing costs by 0.15 percentage points. For a borrower with a mortgage of £150,000 arranged over 20 years, this will add just under £12 a month to repayments. Most changes to tracker mortgages will come in at the same time. According to the banking trade body UK Finance, about 850,000 borrowers have a tracker mortgage and will pay an average of £15.45 a month more after the Bank’s December increase, while about 1.1 million are on an SVR and will pay an average of £9.58 a month more. The next base rate decision will come in early February. A further increase would automatically mean higher costs for anyone with a tracker mortgage, and would be likely to be added to SVRs. Every 0.1 percentage point increase will add about £7 to a £150,000 mortgage. There hasn’t been much change in the cost of new fixed-rate mortgages, although Nationwide this week announced it was putting up prices. The biggest increase was on its three-year fixed-rate at 75% loan-to-value, which has gone up from 1.44% to 1.64%. Meanwhile, council tax bills are expected to rise on 1 April by 2.99%. Councils are permitted to increase bills by an average of 1.99% a year, without consulting residents, plus a further 1% to be spent on social care. This week, research by the Local Government Chronicle found that two-thirds of councils plan to up bills by the maximum allowed. The average band D council tax bill in England is currently £1,898, and a 2.99% increase would add £57. For many in larger houses, 2022 will be the year their annual council tax bill tops £2,000 for the first time. As well as price rises to contend with, there is also the prospect of taking home less of your cash, as national insurance contributions increase at the start of the new tax year. From 6 April, workers will pay a 1.25 percentage point levy to go towards funding social care – the charge will be applied to class 1 contributions for employees and class 4 contributions for the self-employed. The tax on dividends will rise by the same amount at the same time. For an employee earning £25,000 a year, the levy will mean a fall in their take-home pay of £152 a year, or just under £13 a month, according to the Which? calculator. Higher earners will pay more. Someone on £40,000 a year will pay an extra £339 a year, or £28.25 a month; while someone earning £65,000 will take home £652 less a year, or £54 a month. There won’t be any change in income tax rates or thresholds but that is not all good news. The personal income tax allowance has been frozen at £12,570, which means you won’t benefit as much from any pay rise as you would had it gone up as in previous years. In England and Wales, the higher-rate threshold has stayed the same, too, at £50,270. Government figures suggest that compared with if the threshold had risen in line with 1.6% inflation, a basic rate taxpayer will have an average real loss of £41, a higher rate taxpayer will have an average real loss of £165, and an additional rate taxpayer will have an average real loss of £73.

1/8/2022,"Haiti, the western hemisphere’s poorest country, has often been a byword for deforestation and environmental calamity. It is often said that its border with the Dominican Republic can be seen from space, so marked is the difference between the lush forests to the east, and the scarred wasteland to the west. “In nature everything is connected to one other,” said Jean-Baptiste Chavannes, who in 1973 founded the Papaye Peasant Movement (MPP), which works to tackle deforestation and the climate crisis in Haiti’s poorest regions. “To disturb one is to disturb all.”  Haiti’s woes seem to deepen with each passing month. Widespread protests and rolling fuel shortages have marked daily life for two years. In July last year, the Caribbean country’s president, Jovenel Moïse, was assassinated in his own home. The following month, its impoverished southern peninsula was struck by a 7.2 magnitude earthquake, killing at least 2,200 people and destroying tens of thousands of homes. Then, in September, a wave of deportations of Haitian nationals from the US, amid an alarming increase in kidnappings, thrust Haiti into further instability. But underpinning much of the vibrant yet embattled country’s troubles is environmental injustice and food insecurity, with 4.4 million people (of a population of nearly 11 million) at risk of hunger. Widespread deforestation over centuries, largely owing to the colonial timber trade as well as more recent felling for cooking fuel, has damaged fertile lands, and left them vulnerable to erosion, flooding, and drought. Seasonal hurricanes wreak havoc on homes and livelihoods, and contribute to the agricultural degradation each year. Previous top-down international development projects flooded Haitian marketplaces with unsustainable food staples, hamstringing local farmers’ attempts to achieve food sovereignty. MPP is a grassroots organisation that seeks to tackle the climate crisis and related food insecurity by working with subsistence farmers across Haiti. With more than 40 years of experience in Haiti’s rural Central Plateau, MPP works with 60,000 members to improve deforested landscape so people living there can eat, while increasing forest cover to help reduce carbon levels. “The struggle for food sovereignty is the fight against global warming,” Chavannes said. “All actions aimed at food sovereignty will have a direct impact on the climate crisis.” MPP carries out its work directly with local people, while trying to reduce farmers’ reliance on multinational organisations and charities, which have often mismanaged resources and contributed to Haiti’s challenges, said Jusléne Tyresias, MPP’s programme director. “A local approach is better because it creates direct employment, values local knowledge, skills, and resources,” she said, adding that large international NGOs often spent resources on pricey hotels and transport, rather than using local knowhow. “Locals living in the territory will be more involved because they know the severity of the problem better than those who come from outside.” This grassroots approach has won plaudits from its international backers, including the Clima Fund. Global Greengrants Fund UK, one of four charity partners in the Guardian and Observer’s 2021 Climate Justice appeal, is a member of the Clima Fund, and will use its share of appeal donations on grassroots projects such as MPP. “MPP is a fantastic example of the kinds of grassroots movements the Clima Fund resources in over 160 countries globally; they demonstrate the efficacy of building solutions from the bottom up – not just what is built, but also how it’s built with whom,” said Lindley Mease, Clima’s fund director. “They meet the material needs of a climate-ravaged island through culturally appropriate and abundant food, sustainable water recapture systems, and increased soil health, while also maintaining an active membership of 61,000 people governed by a circle of women. As part of the 200-million member [international farmers’ movement] La Via Campesina, they are modelling how strategic, collective organising can cool the planet at scale.” As a result of MPP’s work, swaths of the Central Plateau, once ravaged by deforestation, now teem with life. MPP’s network of peasant farmers has planted tens of millions of trees, while organisers have installed water infrastructure for homes and crops while training women and young Haitians in agro-ecology. Solar panels have been installed on homes, reducing reliance on burning wood for fuel, and a radio station broadcasts training and ecological advice. “Regionally and internationally, the MPP is part of global efforts to strengthen grassroots feminist movements, and is part of a global movement of small-scale farmers advancing food sovereignty with La Via Campesina,” said Sara Mersha, director of grant-making and advocacy at Grassroots International, after a visit to one of MPP’s projects. “It’s this combination of strategies – with a focus on powerful organising and a connection with the earth – that make me understand what it means when MPP and La Via Campesina assert, ‘small farmers cool the planet!’” MPP has also used rapid response teams during Haiti’s frequent natural disasters, including the earthquake that struck the south of the country in August. In the immediate aftermath of that tragedy, MPP provided food, water and shelter, before introducing long-term resilience strategies, such as seed distribution and developing local infrastructure. In 2010, when an earthquake levelled much of the capital, Port-au-Prince, and the surrounding areas, killing more than 220,000 people, MPP set up eco-villages, in which survivors and victims were taught to live and farm sustainably. Despite such a wide-ranging remit, MPP’s founder regards the movement’s work as grounded in one central tenet: sovereignty. “Sovereignty is nurtured as the right of every person to define environmentally friendly food production policies,” Chavannes said. “Respect for human life; respect for the rights of peasant families over agricultural land; the rights of indigenous peoples over their territories; respect for women’s rights and respect for culture; and the ways of feeding people.”  Donations can be made online by credit card, debit card or PayPal, or by phone on 0151 284 1126.

1/8/2022,"While George Saunders was writing his latest book, A Swim in a Pond in the Rain, he noticed something strange. The book examines seven Russian short stories, which Saunders has taught on the creative writing course at Syracuse University, New York, for 20 years. Many writers teach, and many have a difficult relationship with teaching, but Saunders long ago “decided to not let it be like that”. He sliced his weeks into three days of teaching, four of writing, a clear division of roles. But when he started the Russian book, however, his two lives merged. He adopted his “teaching stance” while he wrote, and was amazed by “how much fun” he had. “There’s a different sensibility when I walk into a classroom,” he says. The outward appearance is the same – “sloppy balding hippy” – but “I’m a slightly nicer and less egotistical person”. With this slightly nicer, less egotistical person at the keyboard, interesting things began to happen, and his fiction-writing self “got a real boost”.  Last month Saunders launched the “natural extension” to his teaching and that book: Story Club, a subscription newsletter on Substack. In his twice-weekly newsletter, Saunders promises to look at what makes stories work – and “what [we can] learn about the mind by watching it read and process a story”. He will also look at what makes stories not work, including sharing his own early drafts of tales knocked back by the New Yorker. One week after launch, thousands had already subscribed. But why does Saunders want to do it? What wisdom, if any, does he want to impart? He won MacArthur and Guggenheim fellowships in 2006 off the back of his first short-story collections, and since then the awards and accolades have rolled in. There was the Folio prize for Tenth of December in 2014, and in 2017 a Booker for Lincoln in the Bardo, his first – and so far, only – novel. It is set in the graveyard where Abraham Lincoln’s son was buried, and populated by a troupe of restless ghosts. But even before he wrote it, Saunders was a literary celebrity. David Sedaris, Lena Dunham, Miranda July and Ben Stiller voiced the audiobook. All of which means: “At this point,” Saunders says, speaking on the phone from his home in Corralitos, California, “I’m like a grizzled eminence.” He could be locking himself away to write the “big War and Peace-type novel that spans 10 or 15 years and goes into a lot of people’s heads” that he’s spoken about recently. But instead, eminence has taught Saunders to weigh the extra potency it gives his teaching. “If my bit of disapproval or indifference or praise has an undue effect, good.” He is 63, and his age seems to fidget at the edge of his vision. In a podcast with Substack, he said he joined the platform because he “hated” the idea of losing the wisdom that students have imparted to him over the years. (It is typical of his magnanimity that he posits himself as the gatherer of others’ wisdom rather than the purveyor of his own.) “I thought: ‘So when I’m done with this life, that’s gone …’” Confronting that idea made him feel “a little miffed”, so he came up with Story Club. In his genial introduction he describes how he sees the club working: “The writer is a person running through some winter woods, wearing ice skates. The creative writing programme (or Story Club) is a frozen pond that suddenly appears: you are, of course, still using your own natural energy (because what else could you use?), are still headed in ‘your’ direction – only now, you’re moving faster. “So, as in that metaphor, the writer doesn’t have to worry, or obsess, or get her ducks in a row, or plan: she just has to skate, which means she has to be energetic in relation to the challenges the teacher puts in front of her; willing to take them on in a spirit of: ‘Well, what the heck – it might help.’” His first newsletter includes a photograph of his solitary writing shed in the woods behind the house in Corralitos. His wife, Paula, bought it for him a few years ago, and it’s a writer’s dream. No fences or distant rooftops. Just the shed surrounded by trees and the shadows of trees. Writers’ rooms are usually reclusive. But Saunders is using his to host a writing community. Why does he care? “I suppose one of the things that a person worries about along the way is, ‘Does this really matter?’” He got an answer to this question as soon as the letters started to arrive from readers of A Swim in a Pond in the Rain. Saunders has always had a healthy mailbag. “But those letters about the Russian book … People were saying they were going through a hard time and the book spoke to them. It wasn’t anything philosophical. It was just the feeling of another human voice talking to them.” Saunders is a great writer, and part of the greatness is that reading him feels very much like being spoken to kindly. This might be why some people wrote to add their observations to his readings of the stories. Others wrote to disagree. One woman argued for close study of the horse in Tolstoy’s Master and Man. “And she’s absolutely right,” he says. When somebody writes to say “‘I hated your novel’, that’s not so fun”. But if they respond to a story, “that’s a classroom conversation”, right there in the shed. Saunders’s wisdom of teaching is: “Make energy. You feel the temperature rise, then it’s like everybody in the room has ripened.” A Swim in a Pond in the Rain advocates the closest kind of close reading. There are diagrams and grids, nuts and bolts. Saunders studied engineering at university and he loves “that close, almost engineering way” of approaching text. “I find it really comforting to think that it’s a process,” he says. But the approach provides other kinds of solace, too. “To go up in that shed every day was so helpful.” It was, he says, a way of saying: “‘I can’t control the world.’ We do so much projective worrying. There are all these feeds coming into our house, into our heads, telling us all the horrible things that are happening … And we welcome it in … ” But if a person chooses instead to “check on a cool story, you are concentrating on something, and you are watching your own mind react to it. I think that is good in the way that meditation is good. “For me, the pandemic – I see it as a little bit like dying and being a ghost. Because you can see the world. It’s still there. And you can remember being in it and loving it and not having to worry about wearing a mask … You can remember that but you can’t do it. So it does, in the same way being a ghost would, make a little pause. Like: ‘Hah! Wow! This world is crazy. It’s wonderful. I wish I was in it again!’ And of course the hope is that we’ll get back in it.” As well as lifting you out of the anxiety of the pandemic, such close reading, he believes, is key to writing your own work. When Saunders went into teaching mode in his shed, he says, “I suddenly was seeing ideas all over the place.” Ordinarily he’s “a one-or-two-stories-a-year person”. But after he finished A Swim in a Pond in the Rain, he wrote four in 18 months, and has sent off the manuscript for his next collection. The effect of reading so closely was “like listening to a bunch of great albums and trying to take them apart, and suddenly you’re musical”. “This is so corny,” he says, but one night, soon after he had completed A Swim in a Pond in the Rain, he “actually had a dream of the first four or five lines” of a story. He got out of bed, went to the kitchen and sat down to write. “I don’t usually do this. But I got all the way to the end of it at three in the morning.” He then spent a year revising. Saunders says Substack won’t take him away from the great novel, “because I don’t know what it is”. He just knows there is a hankering for such a thing, and he wonders if he “could write about regular people in America”. As he puts it: “I got to come to the table as a published writer with the first couple of books that were very funny and sci-fi and dystopian. So now I feel like I’m coming on a journey to figure out to what extent that chimes with my actual feelings about life. I guess I want to make sure that what I’m doing is not in any way trivial. In other words, that it would speak to people in the future, that it would be a properly, very properly, recognised book, the light and the darkness in human existence. When I think about War and Peace, that took a real swing at it … So I just want to take a really good swing at it.” Besides, he says: “I don’t like relaxing. My policy is [to] overload myself. I work better with less sleep and I work better with more work.”  To learn more or to subscribe to receive George’s work in your inbox, visit Story Club at georgesaunders.substack.com 1 Revise“Intuition, those momentary flashes of judgment that we have when we are editing, that’s really where the gold is,” Saunders says. In Story Club, he describes his mental compass, which has a needle that points to P (Positive) or N (Negative) according to how he feels when he rereads his own words. He checks the needle each sentence. If it points to N, he revises. He revises till the needle points to P for the entire text. 2 Number the draftsSaunders calls this “psychological self‑gaming”. Every time there’s a big change, he renumbers the draft. “I can go back, and say: ‘Oh, I’m on 98.’” Does he get into the thousands? “It depends how you count them.” 3 PrintRevision is “not meaningful unless I print,” he says. “There’s a visual difference in reading on the page versus the computer. I don’t trust it unless I’m reading a hard copy.” 4 Know when you over-reviseThose new to writing should overwrite just “to get a familiarity with their particular world. We have to learn our individual symptoms” of over-revision. “For me,” Saunders says, “the symptom is the humour goes out of it.” 5 Any time can be good time“Productivity and time at desk are not necessarily linearly related,” Saunders says. “When I used to have that engineering job, I was never writing more than 40 minutes at a time. And then I would sit down and do that little mental thing: ‘I hereby permit you to write at your desk. Go ahead. Cut the bullshit. Cut to the chase.’” 6 Face the problems in your story“If you try to deny the problem and write in spite of the problem in a story you’re writing, it is not going to be very good. But if you say to yourself in the story: ‘You got a problem, haven’t you?’ then the result is going to be better because it’s honest.” 7 Avoid thinking about your book’s big themes“If there’s a little idea that comes to me that’s not sucky, that kind of interests me, I go: ‘OK, I’m going to do that.’ But at that point your mind starts saying: ‘And the reason I’m doing that is because it’s a critique of patriarchy.’ I cut that off. ‘No, no. We don’t know why we’re doing it. We’re just doing it because we like it, and it will tell us what it’s about.’”",Arts/Books,Always wanted to write?

1/8/2022,"On 2 January you tweeted: “Teachers and support staff across the country have put in a Herculean effort over the past 18 months and more, and I know we can count on their steadfast support in the coming weeks as we weather this storm.” I’m a great fan of metaphors but when it comes to pandemics, we have to be pretty careful to choose appropriate ones. Is a Covid pandemic a “storm”? I’ll put it like this: we breathe on each other. That’s how we get Covid. Storms come from up there in the clouds. We don’t breathe storms on each other. More on metaphor and analogies later. In the meantime: on both parts of that sentence, you’re absolutely right. It has been a Herculean effort and we can all count on teachers in the future. So it’s annoying to reflect how little teachers have been helped or praised by your government for their hard work throughout the pandemic. Partly as a result, insults and idiotic comments have appeared about them being workshy or having it easy.

I know many have stepped forward and it’s this blitz spirit that will be essential in turning the tide on Covid.” Have you read the responses to this tweet? I’ll summarise the points that people make, while saving you from the anger. They remind you that people who retire are among the most vulnerable to Covid on account of their age. Though you’ve introduced the requirement that secondary school students wear masks, primary schools are largely mask-free zones. What’s more, schools have many unventilated places that are often full of people very near to each other. These specific conditions are what are sometimes called “super-spreaders”. What is the government’s problem with ventilation? Once scientists had explained to your government that this was an airborne virus, you could have figured out that one way to hinder it from circulating in the atmosphere surrounding a group of people would have been to do all you could to enable fresh and/or filtered air to circulate instead. You appear to know this, because the government has now offered to provide 7,000 air cleaning units for education settings. This number was of course greeted with hysterical and derisory laughter. Many took the figure of 7,000 as a cue to do some arithmetic. It went like this: how many classrooms are there in England? A common estimate seemed to be around 300,000, though some came in at quite a few more, and I don’t know. But whatever the real answer is, it’s clearly not 7,000, or anything like it. I’ll leave you to do the percentages on how many classrooms will be reached by your offer. So what was this announcement for? Who was supposed to be fooled by it? Teachers? Other school staff? Children? Older school students? Parents? Or the British public who don’t have a sense of how many classrooms there are? Did you think that the vast majority of the population would say to themselves: “7000? Wow, this government is really rolling up its sleeves and fighting the virus now!” Did you? Let’s go back to the first tweet I quoted. It’s full of praise. But if you can only come up with 7,000 air filters, the praise is just hooey, isn’t it? And asking retired teachers to go into schools without one of the 7,000 air filters is both unkind and dangerous. Then you invoked the “blitz spirit”. Do you really want to make an analogy between a living human enemy trying to kill us and a virus that has no human intentions? Our main source of help to curb the numbers killed or maimed by Covid is medical science, not self-sacrifice – if that’s what you mean by the blitz spirit. The advice or help from government has repeatedly been confusing, wrong or inadequate – . So whatever this blitz spirit was, how will it be “essential” in “turning the tide” on Covid? My parents told me about the blitz: like getting into shelters that couldn’t withstand a hit. Come to think of it, that could be a bit like you sending retired teachers into unventilated schools. My mother told me that she did try to follow government instructions. One time when she was out and heard a doodlebug in the sky, she knew that the guidelines were to find a gutter and lie in it. She did just that. It was by White City station. If it was the blitz spirit that made her lie down in the gutter, I’m not sure that her doing it turned back the Nazi tide – if that was the tide you were talking about.

1/8/2022,"Britain’s leading theatre companies must appoint more people of colour and from working-class backgrounds at senior levels to drive real and lasting change in the sector, a British Asian artistic director has said. Pravesh Kumar, the founder of Rifco Theatre Company, which stages productions aimed at British Asian audiences, said: “The leadership is what we really need to look at: it’s the big jobs where we need to have more diverse voices, more representative voices.  “The boards need to change and the senior executive roles need to change. Then you’ll start seeing creative change.” Kumar, who was awarded an OBE in the new year honours, said: “Change is starting to happen, but it’s not going fast enough. The pandemic will make it more difficult because [organisations] will be even more risk averse and sadly people of colour are often seen as risky. “We haven’t reached anywhere near equality yet. Theatre remains a mostly white and middle-class-led industry where voices like mine are still rare.” Many theatres did not attract audiences from minority ethnic groups or working-class backgrounds because most plays and productions did not reflect their experiences and interests, he said. “Even when there are people of colour on stage, it is not authentic. It’s not how we see ourselves.” Kumar, who grew up on a council estate in Slough, trained and worked as an actor but never felt acting was his calling. After a spell as a British Airways check-in agent in the late 1990s, he and some friends staged a show called Airport 2000: Asians in Transit, at the Riverside Studios in west London. He said: “It was a series of sketches, and I was writing, acting, producing and carrying the set. Everything went on my credit card. We had no marketing budget, it was all word of mouth. We had three shows, and they were all full. We were just flabbergasted that we’d hit upon this audience that not only came [to the theatre] but looked like us. And that was the accidental birth of Rifco.” The touring company focuses on accessible new plays and musicals that reflect and celebrate British Asian experiences. About 30,000 people saw Britain’s Got Bhangra, a musical about racism in the UK music industry, and more than 50,000 saw The Deranged Marriage, a play about honour and arranged marriages set in a “chaotic, ridiculous, over-the-top British Asian wedding – which they all are, by the way”. Kumar said: “What we make is authentic and entertaining, which is often a dirty word in theatre now. We are talking about issues within our community – honour, LGBTQ issues, arranged marriages – but we’re doing it in our own voice, through our own lens. It feels like you can have a good night out, but we can also talk about all those issues that are important.” He said the Black Lives Matter movement had given “real impetus to [the arts community] to sort things out, but my fear is how long will this momentum last.” Venues that he approached for his productions “often want to book me into the ‘diverse slot’, and I’m saying we’re a British theatre company and I know there’s a huge audience because we’ve proved it every year. And it’s not just people of colour, it’s everybody.” Kumar said he was still reeling from being awarded an OBE. “My mother has not got off the phone. When I left British Airways to commit myself to the arts, it was: ‘How dare you give up a good job?’ For a lot of British south Asian families that’s still the case. Hopefully, people like me getting awards, being recognised, will change that.”",Arts/Stage,"Appoint people of colour to senior theatre roles, British Asian artistic director says",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/08/people-of-colour-senior-theatre-roles-pravesh-kumar
1/8/2022,"Novak Djokovic relied on a weeks-old Covid infection to justify his vaccine-free travel to Australia and was given a green light by the federal government just days before arriving in the country, court documents reveal. Court documents associated with Djokovic’s challenge to his visa cancellation were published by the federal circuit court late Saturday, ahead of an urgent hearing on Monday.  The documents reveal that Djokovic relied on a very recent Covid-19 infection, recorded on 16 December by the Institute of Public Health of Serbia, to argue he was exempt from vaccine travel requirements. They reveal he has also accused Australian government officials of unfairly pressuring him to accept a decision on his visa cancellation in the early hours of the morning, without the chance to properly talk with his lawyers or rest after 25 hours of travelling. He was granted a temporary visa to enter Australia on 18 November, and received a letter from the chief medical officer of Tennis Australia on 30 December recording he had a “medical exemption from Covid vaccination” on the ground that he had recently recovered from the virus. On New Year’s Day, Djokovic had also received a document from the home affairs department about his Australian travel declaration, which told Djokovic that “[his] Australia travel declaration [had] been assessed” and that “[his] responses indicate[d] that [he met] the requirements for a quarantine-free arrival into Australia where permitted by the jurisdiction of your arrival”. After his arrival, he underwent repeated interviews in the early hours of Tuesday morning, and explained to home affairs officials that his recent infection gave him an exemption, and that he had been cleared by an independent committee involving Tennis Australia and the Victorian state government. He was told by Australian government officials that they would make a decision imminently, but would give him 20 minutes to make any further arguments. About 5.20am, Djokovic said he asked for more time to rest and to “talk to [his] solicitor again”. He asked if he could be given until 8am or 8.30am. He alleges the government official responded: “[S]o that’s absolutely fine, I have spoken with my supervisors and they’re more than happy to allow you have to rest.” Djokovic then alleges he was pressured into allowing the officials to make an immediate decision, despite his lack of rest, and his confusion and shock at the situation. He said two officials walked up to him as he was waiting for a bed to be prepared, and tried to convince him to let them make a decision immediately. He alleges they said something like “the sooner that they make a decision, the better for [Mr Djokovic] and [his] representatives”. He again asked for more time. About 6am, Djokovic said he was woken by officials and again urged to let them make a decision immediately. “Over several pages of transcript the supervisor pressured Mr Djokovic to simply continue the interview immediately,” court document say. “Mr Djokovic, having formed the view that ‘[they were] going to cancel [his] visa, it’s obvious’ relented, feeling he had no choice, and on the basis of an understanding based on what they had said to him that it was better for him if the interview was done right away.” Djokovic’s challenge to the visa cancellation relies on a number of administrative failings he says affected the decision-making process. He said that he believed he had done everything he needed to do to enter Australia, given he had a visa, had received certification from the tournament organiser following a review by a panel established by the Victorian government, and had received a document informing him that he “met the requirements for quarantine-free arrival” by the home affairs department. He alleges the delegate for the minister for home affairs, Karen Andrews, failed to give him proper notice of the cancellation of his visa, misapplied recommendations from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (Atagi), and failed to take account of “highly probative evidence” that Djokovic had a medical contraindication allowing him to travel. The Djokovic scandal deepened on Saturday after separate revelations that Tennis Australia informed players that a prior infection would be a reason to exempt them from Australia’s tough border restrictions. That advice was given despite the health department telling Tennis Australia on two occasions that exemptions did not exist for those recently infected with Covid. Tennis Australia has largely refused to answer questions or media queries about its handling of the matter. But a leaked video of Tennis Australia boss Craig Tiley emerged in News Corp papers on Saturday afternoon, showing him telling his staff they had done “an unbelievable job” in handling the affair. “We’ve chosen at this point not to be very public with it and simply because there is a pending lawsuit related to entry into Australia. Once that has run its course, we’ll be able to share more with you,” he said. “There’s a lot of finger-pointing going on and a lot of blaming going on, but I can assure you our team has done an unbelievable job and have done everything they possibly could according to all the instructions that they have been provided.” Further details also emerged about Tiley’s interactions with Atagi about exemptions for players either recently infected with Covid or who had only received one vaccination dose. The Age reported that Tiley had told Atagi the treatment of such players “goes to the heart of the viability of the Australian Open”.",Sport/Sport,"Novak Djokovic relied on December Covid infection for Australian vaccine exemption, court documents reveal",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/08/novak-djokovic-relied-on-december-covid-infection-for-vaccine-exemption-court-documents-reveal
