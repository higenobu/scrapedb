3/25/2022,"Good morning. Joe Biden is due to see firsthand the scale of the Ukrainian refugee crisis today when he visits Poland, which has taken in more than 2 million people fleeing Russian forces across the border. His trip comes hours after Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, told leaders at the European Council they had been “a little late” in imposing sanctions on Russia, suggesting the crisis could have been preventable. The US president will fly to the eastern Polish town of Rzeszów, bringing him to within 80 km (50 miles) of the country’s border with Ukraine,where there has been a huge influx of refugees since Russia invaded a month ago. The crisis has left public services struggling to cope in Poland, which was home to the biggest Ukrainian refugee population in the region before the war. What did Zelenskiy say about sanctions? “You blocked Nord Stream 2. We are grateful to you. And rightly so. But it was also a little late. Because if it had been in time, Russia would not have created a gas crisis. At least there was a chance,” he said. What’s happening on the ground? Russia is running out of precision-guided munitions and it is more likely to rely on so-called dumb bombs and artillery, a senior Pentagon official said last night, Reuters reported. What else is happening? US volunteers have reached the frontline of the war in Ukraine. Donald Trump has sued Hillary Clinton, the Democratic National Committee and other people and entities tied to the investigation of Russian election interference in 2016, claiming that in an attempt to rig the election they orchestrated a conspiracy that made Watergate “pale in comparison”. The suit came a day after the release of a letter from a prosecutor in New York who said he believed Trump was “guilty of numerous felony violations” in his business affairs, despite the district attorney in Manhattan choosing not to indict. Trump beat Clinton for the presidency in 2016. Nonetheless, six years on he alleges she is guilty of “racketeering” and a “conspiracy to commit injurious falsehood”, among other claims. Who else is listed as defendants in the suit? Among them are the ex-FBI officials James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page; the former British spy Christopher Steele, the author of a famous dossier on Trump’s links to Moscow; Jake Sullivan, now Biden’s national security adviser; and John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chair. What does the lawsuit say Clinton and co did? Trump’s new lawsuit claims that in the run-up to the 2016 election “Hillary Clinton and her cohorts orchestrated an unthinkable plot – one that shocks the conscience and is an affront to this nation’s democracy”. At 2.54pm on the second day of Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation hearings that will determine whether she takes a seat on the US supreme court, the solemn proceedings took a nosedive into farce, writes Ed Pilkington. Ted Cruz, the Republican senator from Texas, turned theatrically to an outsized blow-up of a children’s book, Antiracist Baby by Ibram X Kendi. Pointing to a cartoon from its pages of an infant in diapers taking their first walk, he asked Jackson: “Do you agree with this book … that babies are racist?” “Senator,” Jackson began with a sigh. And then she paused for seven full seconds, which in the august setting of the Senate judiciary committee hearing felt like a year. For the one and only time in the 13 hours of questioning that Jackson endured that day, the nominee appeared flummoxed. Or was it flabbergasted? But will the political circus work? “They are trying to find some way to make her look less than qualified,” Janai Nelson of NAACP concluded. “They failed miserably.” California residents could get free public transit rides and gas rebates under a proposal from the governor to help bring relief as fuel prices in the state reach record highs. Gavin Newsom’s plan is the latest floated by officials in California, where drivers are paying more for fuel than anywhere else in the country. North Korea has confirmed it tested a new, powerful type of intercontinental ballistic missile, marking an end to a self-imposed moratorium on long-range testing in place since 2017 and drawing international condemnation. The attorney general of Texas has declared a school district’s celebration of LGBTQ+ students “sex education” and in violation of Texas law. For the past eight years, students have held a district-wide Pride week as a chance to celebrate LGBTQ+ students, staff and families in the district. China reported almost 5,000 Covid-19 cases on Friday, as authorities continued to battle an outbreak of the highly transmissible Omicron variant. After the death of a nurse in Shanghai who was denied hospitalization after an asthma attack, many are angry that China’s Covid responses appear to be causing more deaths than the virus itself. An ice shelf about the size of Rome has collapsed in East Antarctica within days of record-high temperatures, according to satellite data. The Conger ice shelf, which had an approximate surface area of 1,200 sq km, is believed to have collapsed on 15 March. East Antarctica experienced unusually high temperatures last week, with Concordia station hitting a record -11.8C on 18 March, more than 40C warmer than seasonal norms, thanks to an atmospheric river that trapped heat over the continent. One of the defining features of a friendship is that we don’t keep a rolling moral score of each other, writes Eleanor Gordon-Smith. Love is patient, love is kind, “it keeps no record of wrongs”. This is a very nice thing, usually – it means we can reveal our unpolished selves. But sometimes it means that, after years of friendship, we look up at the person we call a friend and realise that in the time we weren’t keeping inventory of the ethical infractions, they were still busy racking them up. Russian and Ukrainian environmental activists have made a joint call for a European embargo on Russian oil, gas and coal, as children and young people prepare to take part in the latest wave of climate crisis school strikes and protests around the world. The campaigners said the ban on trade in Russian fossil fuels would starve its invasion of Ukraine of crucial funds, while accelerating Europe’s transition to clean energy. A staggering 78% of vets in the UK say they have seen a rise in worryingly overweight pets in recent years, and lockdown has made things worse. “Being at home has made owners more likely to give pets a little bit of what they’re having,” said the PDSA vet Lynne James. “It’s easy to do, when they’re sat there, looking at you.” But could social media’s obsession with chonky cats and podgy pooches also be to blame?

3/25/2022,"The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has called for the chief executive of P&O Ferries to resign over the sacking of 800 workers and pledged to force the ferry company to reverse the move and pay its crew the minimum wage. Peter Hebblethwaite admitted to MPs on Thursday that his company broke the law by sacking the 800 workers without consultation. Shapps said Hebblethwaite performance in front of the transport and business committee was “brazen, breathtaking, and showed incredible arrogance”. Speaking to Sky News, Shapps said: “I cannot believe that he can stay in that role having admitted to deliberately going out and using a loophole – well break the law – but also use a loophole. “They flagged their ships through Cyprus avoided having to tell anybody about this, or they felt they did. And even though they know they’ve broken the law, what they’ve done is to pay people off in such a way to try and buy their silence. It’s unacceptable.” Shapps also pledged new legislation next week which which will “both close every possible loophole that exists, and force them to U-turn”. He said P&O’s plan to replace the sacked workers with agency staff on less than the minimum wage was “simply unacceptable and we will force that to change”. He accused P&O of “mischievously” registering their ships in Cypress flag to avoid UK laws. He added: “They were breaking the law and deliberately set out to break the law, but effectively pay people off for their silence. We can’t have a situation where the minimum wage exists onshore, but as soon as you’re offshore … people aren’t covered by British laws on things like minimum wage. and overseas cheap labour is exploited on those routes.” Shapps suggested the new law, which he said he is drawing up in consultation with Labour, would ban shipping companies from operating from British ports if they fail to pay the minimum wage. He said: “I’ve already spoken to my opposite number in the House of Commons in order to try and build a consensus around this. “My message to P&O is simple: their wheezes are not going to work. We are going to legally require them to go back on it. They might as well start on that now. And if they haven’t got the right leadership there to do it at the moment. And yesterday we saw through that brazen breathtaking arrogance that they don’t, then they will probably need to think about sorting that out first.”",News/Business,"P&O Ferries boss should quit after ‘brazen’ mass sackings, says Shapps",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/25/po-ferries-boss-should-quit-after-brazen-mass-sackings-says-shapps
3/25/2022,"China’s world No 3 Ding Liren could make an unlikely late bid for a place in the Candidates tournament that will decide Magnus Carlsen’s next challenger. Ding’s chances seemed to have vanished when visa problems prevented him competing in the current Grand Prix series in Berlin which will qualify two winners for the Candidates at Madrid in June, but a possible lifeline has appeared due to Fide’s six-month ban on Sergey Karjakin, who had qualified for Madrid via the 2021 World Cup but will now be barred from competing in the Candidates. Karjakin won the Candidates in 2016 and went on to tie 6-6 with Carlsen in the world championship match before losing the speed chess tie-break. Fide regulations state that a replacement will be the highest rated eligible player on the May 2022 rating list who has played 30 rated games in the previous 12 months. Due to pandemic and visa issues, Ding has played only four of the required 30, and those were in a hastily arranged match to qualify him for an abortive Grand Prix start. Then on Thursday a tweet appeared: “Chinese Chess Association will start a series of qualifying tournaments at end of this month for the 19th Asian Games. All top players are required to play, including Ding Liren [plus seven named others] …” The Games are to be held in Hangzhou, China, in September. This announcement may be coincidental with Ding’s Madrid problem. The Asian Games has only included chess twice previously, in 2006 and 2010, so China, the current open and women’s Olympiad champions, will expect to succeed on home ground with its strongest team and will also be conscious of the growing threat from India’s teenage stars. Even if next month’s official Games qualifier has many fewer than the required 26 games, there is the option for Ding to arrange other Fide-rated matches there against conveniently available opponents. It would be a tiring schedule and Ding may lose some Fide points, but he has a useful cushion against any accidents that could risk others overtaking him. The current live ratings show Ding on 2799 Fide points. He is 11 ahead of Levon Aronian and 23 ahead of Richard Rapport, the current favourites to qualify. He is 24 ahead of Wesley So of the US, who has an outside chance in Berlin. So the advice to Ding must be: “Go for it!” Whether or not he and Beijing’s sports officials are sufficiently motivated and organised to do so remains to be seen. As he mulled over whether to try to qualify for Madrid, Ding had a more pressing concern on Thursday: a four-game online rapid semi-final against Magnus Carlsen in the Charity Cup, staged to raise funds for Unicef in Ukraine and part of the Meltwater Champions Tour. Carlsen won the first Tour event and has been in strong form this week, including a convincing victory over England’s Gawain Jones. The Ding v Carlsen semi-final on Thursday evening was a level battle for the first two games, in which the world champion opened as White with the rare move 1 e3, and for most of the third until the Chinese GM, for whom the playing session was the small hours of the morning, blundered or mouse-slipped when short of time in a drawn queen ending and was immediately lost. In the fourth and final game Ding was a touch better, could not make progress against Carlsen’s resilient defence, went into a drawn B v N ending, and finally blundered his knight. In the second semi-final, Poland’s 2021 World Cup winner and 2022 Candidate Jan-Krzysztof Duda defeated Vietnam’s No 1 Le Quang Liem, now head chess coach at Webster University in the US. Earlier, in his quarter-final, Duda scored with a clever tactic against the Czech David Navara. Can you find White’s winning move? The solution is below. The two-day Carlsen v Duda final is viewable free and live online, starting 5pm Saturday and 6pm on Sunday. In Berlin in the final leg of the Fide Grand Prix qualifying two winners for the Candidates, Aronian has the edge in the group of death where he meets Hikaru Nakamura and two Russians. Aronian v Nakamura in round one began with a Queen’s Gambit Accepted: 1 d4 d5 2 c4 dxc4 3 e4!? Normal is 3 Nf3, while 3 e3 sets a trap which catches many online novices: 3...b5? 4 a4 c6? 5 axb5 cxb5? 6 Qf3! winning at least a piece. 3...b5 4 a4 c6 5 axb5 cxb5 6 Nc3 Qb6 7 Nd5 Qb7 8 Bf4 e5 9 Bxe5 Nd7 10 Bf4 Ngf6 11 Nc7+ Kd8 12 Nxa8 Qxe4+ 13 Ne2 Qxa8. This sharp position already appeared in Aronian v Leinier Domínguez from an earlier Grand Prix game. Aronian was sure to have analysed it further, but the line with Black was also in Nakamura’s repertoire a decade ago, so he was ready to take it on again. The decisive position for this game and perhaps for the whole Candidates qualifier came at Black’s 23rd. The computer gives 23...N5xc3 as level, while Nakamura’s 23...Nf4? allowed White three different replies for a clear advantage. Aronian chose 24 Qa2! which soon exchanges queens with a winning ending. That single blunder probably ruined the five-time US champion’s bravura attempt to switch from streamer with a million-plus subscribers to potential challenger to Carlsen. 3808 1...Ne2+! 2 Qxe2 (if 2 Kh2 Qh7+! 3 Nh4 Qxh4+ and wins) Qf4+ 3 Kh3 g4+ 4 Kh4 gxf3+ wins. Duda v Navara: 1 Nxa5+! wins after Qxa5 2 b4 or bxa5 2 Rb3 trapping the queen.",Sport/Sport,Chess: China’s Ding Liren could make unlikely late bid for Candidates place,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/25/chess-china-ding-liren-could-make-unlikely-late-bid-for-candidates-place-magnus-carlsen
3/25/2022,"Thousands of teachers around the United States are resuming a strike wave in education that swept the country in 2018 and 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic. School districts across America are facing severe staffing shortages of teachers, substitute teachers and support staff amid Covid-19 disruptions and historically low pay, contributing to burnout and worsening working conditions. Over the past few weeks, teachers have gone on strike in Sacramento, California, Minneapolis, Minnesota, Sonoma county, California, Riverdale, Illinois, and Proviso, Illinois, as teachers in other districts have authorized strikes. Earlier this year, teachers in Chicago, Illinois, were locked out by Chicago Public Schools over their demands for pausing in-person learning during a Covid surge. About 200 teachers at Summit Charter Public Schools in California and Washington – a charter school network supported by funds from the philanthropic foundations of Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and other wealthy Silicon Valley investors – have been fighting for a first union contract since unionizing in December 2019. The move came despite opposition from school administration, which included the firing of three union-supporting teachers. Negotiations have been at an impasse since 2021, and now teachers are threatening to take steps toward a strike if a new contract isn’t reached withthe administration, which includes the highest-paid school administrator in California, CEO Diane Tavenner, with a salary of more than $450,000 annually. During the pandemic, teachers at Summit faced threats of pay freezes and layoffs. “If we don’t come to an agreement as soon as possible, our teachers are preparing for a strike,” said Janine Peñafort, a Spanish teacher at Summit School Prep in Redwood, California, and president of Unite Summit Teachers, which represents teachers at the schools. “Ever since Summit expanded their schools, teachers have had less of a say in the decisions being made in our school. I think that sense of powerlessness and our demanding workload causes a lot of teachers to leave our schools every year.” The union has argued that despite millions of dollars in funding from wealthy billionaires, Summit Public Schools imposes austerity on teachers and schools, which has contributed to high turnover of teachers, lack of support for English language learning students, and an intense workload, which includes mentorships with individual students and more work days than other school districts. Peñafort cited a recent retention survey conducted by the union that found about half of all teachers at Summit Public Schools did not plan to return next school year. Amid high turnover, Peñafort argued teachers were expected to serve as mentors for students throughout their four years of high school, but have no job security. “What we’re advocating for is a two-year probationary period to have that sense of security, especially since the past two years during the pandemic, teachers shifted to virtual learning within a day, showing the value and dedication we put into our jobs every single day,” she added. In Sacramento, California, more than 4,000 teachers and staff represented by Sacramento City Teachers Association and Service Employees International Union 1021, began a strike on 23 March over severe staffing shortages and Covid-related issues as new union contract negotiations with the city’s school district have been at an impasse. Workers voted overwhelmingly to authorize the strike earlier this month, with 95% voting in favor of striking with Sacramento City Teachers Association and 97% in favor of SEIU 1021. SCTA represents about 2,800 staff in the district, and SEIU 1021 represents an additional 1,800 school workers. “It’s just reached past a crisis point,” said David Fisher, president of SCTA and a second-grade teacher for over 20 years. “The district has been saying for years, falsely, that they were in some sort of economic turmoil, even claiming they were on the precipice of state takeover. It turns out, it wasn’t true then and it’s even less true now.” Fisher argued as the school district has received millions in Covid-19 relief funds and state funds, severe staff shortages are leaving students and teachers without proper support. The district has about 10,000 students without a permanent teacher. An additional 600 students are on wait lists for independent study, with 14 teacher vacancies for the program. He also argued the district had continued laying off or was refusing to hire support staff such as teacher assistants. “Instead of investing these dollars on the students, they are just amassing this giant rainy day fund, but it’s pouring out,” added Fisher. “Every student deserves at the very least a teacher in the classroom. What we’ve been experiencing and families have been experiencing is 10,000 students that come to school don’t have a regular teacher, 3,000 or so don’t even have a substitute so they get corralled into cafeterias or split up between classes.” Sacramento City Unified School District argued the strike hurts students and argued their current proposals reflect what the district can afford, with the next successor contract providing an opportunity for the unions and district to negotiate to improve staffing issues. In Minneapolis, Minnesota, over 4,000 teachers represented by Minnesota Federation of Teachers Local 59 have been on strike since 8 March over low pay, a lack of support staff and resources for students, and high turnover. More than 640 teachers and support staff have left the district in the past 18 months. “We’re fighting for safe and stable schools, and what that looks like is systemic changes to the way that education is run in Minneapolis,” said Kearney Burns, a special education teacher at Hiawatha community school in Minneapolis. “What is being done in Minneapolis is trying to run our school systems like a business. There’s a lot of top-down decision making and not a lot of input from actual stakeholders.” Burns emphasized the need for support staff positions to be fully staffed and for these workers to be properly compensated with a living wage, such as educational support professionals who currently make as little as $24,000 a year. She noted teachers had received immense community support through the strike, as these improvements that teachers are fighting for will benefit students and the community. “People know that safe and stable schools create safe and stable communities, and those safe and stable communities create safe and stable cities,” Burns added. “We all want to be back in classrooms teaching our students, but we don’t want it to be the same as it was before.” The Minneapolis School District issued their final offer on 22 March, though negotiations continue as teachers remain on strike to have their demands met.",News/US news,New wave of teachers’ strikes rolls across US,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/25/teachers-strikes-us-low-pay-covid
3/25/2022,"As the House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol attack was negotiating with Donald Trump’s former strategist Steve Bannon to cooperate with its inquiry, the panel affirmed one of their rules: no third-party lawyers could attend witness depositions.That meant when Bannon’s then-attorney asked whether a lawyer for Trump could be present for the closed-door interview to decide what issues were covered by the former president’s invocation of executive privilege, the select committee flatly refused. Now, that refusal appears set to feature as one of Bannon’s central arguments to defend against his contempt of Congress indictment that came after he entirely skipped his deposition last October and refused to produce documents as required by his subpoena. The former Trump aide is advancing a high-stakes – and arcane-sounding – defense as he battles the justice department (DoJ) in a case that could mean up to a year in federal prison and thousands of dollars in fines if convicted – but potentially defang congressional power should he prevail.The all-or-nothing nature of the defense is characteristic of Bannon, a fierce defender and confidante of the former president even after he departed the White House seven months into the Trump administration after a turbulent tenure as his chief strategist. It was precisely because of his contacts with Trump in the days before January 6 that the select committee made Bannon one of the panel’s first subpoena targets as it seeks to uncover whether Trump oversaw a criminal conspiracy that culminated in the Capitol attack.The crux of Bannon’s argument is that he could reasonably believe the subpoena was invalid when the select committee refused to allow a Trump lawyer to attend the deposition, after the former president asserted executive privilege over the materials covered by the subpoena. The argument rests on a 2019 justice department office of legal counsel opinion (OLC) that says congressional subpoenas that prevent executive branch counsel from accompanying executive branch employees to depositions are “legally invalid” and not enforceable.Bannon’s attorneys say the doctrine at issue is protecting the president’s constitutional authority to limit the disclosure of privileged information, which typically involves discussions with close presidential aides who need to be able to offer candid advice.In that sense, the principle extends to Bannon, they argue: the supreme court decided in Nixon v GSA 1977 that former presidents could “assert” executive privilege, while a 2007 OLC opinion found executive privilege could cover discussions with private, non-executive branch employee advisers.And since the select committee issued only one subpoena for both documents and testimony, when the subpoena was invalidated by the panel’s refusal to allow a Trump lawyer to attend, Bannon’s attorneys contend the document request element of the subpoena also became void. “We don’t read OLC opinions in isolation,” David Schoen, one of three attorneys defending Bannon in this case – the others are Evan Corcoran and Bob Costello – told the Guardian in a text message. “They build on each other.”The justice department does not think the OLC opinions protect Bannon, in part because he was not an executive branch employee at the time of January 6, and the select committee contends Trump did not formally assert executive privilege over subpoenaed materials.The assistant US attorney Amanda Vaughn also indicated in recent court filings that Bannon’s argument – that the subpoena was invalid because House deposition rules excluded third-party lawyers – was in bad faith since his then-attorney, Bob Costello, never raised it as an issue at the time.“Costello inquired – but said that he did not need an immediate answer – whether there was a way for a lawyer for President Trump to appear at the defendant’s deposition,” Vaughn said in the justice department’s response to Bannon. But Bannon won an initial victory on the dispute last week after the judge in the case ordered the justice department to turn over OLC “writings” about its position on prosecuting current or former US officials claiming immunity from congressional subpoena over executive privilege.US district judge Carl Nichols granted the request by Bannon’s attorneys, who suggest Costello was relying on the OLC opinions to current and former White House aides when he advised Bannon not to appear for his deposition since the select committee subpoena was invalid. A spokesman for the select committee and a spokesman for the US attorney for the District of Columbia declined to comment. The defense that Bannon is advancing – using broad readings of parts of the justice department’s own positions and amalgamating them into a wider argument – is controversial, but it underscores the complexities facing the justice department in pursuing the case. “Bannon’s trying to use the OLC opinions as a shield that doesn’t quite cover him, but gives him enough of a defense to fend off the DoJ’s necessity of proving criminal intent,” said Jonathan Shaub, a law professor at the University of Kentucky and a former OLC attorney-adviser. To establish criminal contempt of Congress, the justice department has to prove Bannon’s subpoena defiance was “willful” – which Bannon’s attorneys say should be interpreted as meaning whether the former Trump aide knew his conduct was unlawful or wrong.The combined force of Bannon’s arguments, his attorneys say, demonstrate that he did not know his defiance was unlawful, and shifts the burden onto the justice department to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Bannon did not believe the privilege claims were valid. The former Trump aide is also coupling the argument that the subpoena was invalid with the defenses that he relied on the advice of counsel when he defied the subpoena, and that he cannot be prosecuted because OLC opinions – considered binding on the justice department – forbid it.Bannon’s attorneys say the former Trump aide ignored his subpoena entirely on the advice of Costello, who relied on the OLC opinions about immunity for former presidential aides and was the only point of contact with the select committee during negotiations about his cooperation.It is far from clear whether Bannon will prevail. In a hearing last week, Nichols cast doubt on the advice of counsel argument, noting that the relevant case law, Licavoli v United States 1961, holds that relying on legal advice to defy a subpoena is no defense.The justice department argued in their brief that the interpretation of “willful” should in fact remain the standard established by the Licavoli court: “a deliberate and intentional failure to appear or produce records as required” by a congressional subpoena. But Bannon’s lawyers have noted that the Licavoli case did not involve executive privilege and therefore does not apply to Bannon, not least because the justice department has itself maintained that executive privilege cases are unique because of the constitutional implications. “He’s reaching for all the straws that he can,” Shaub said of Bannon. “It may succeed or it may not. But if Nichols rules against him, he’s certainly going to take it to the DC circuit or even up to the supreme court. He’s definitely playing a longer game here.”",News/US news,Bannon’s escape plan: how the Trump strategist is trying to dodge prison,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/25/steve-bannon-house-capitol-attack-committee-contempt
3/25/2022,"We’ve been married for 63 years and are stuck in a food rut. It’s time to try something new I have been cooking for my husband, Lyndon, for most of my adult life, but after 63 years of marriage, I want to spice our meals up. He’s a very simple eater – he likes cottage pies, roasts with meat and two veg – but I’m getting bored of all that. I’m facing a bit of resistance, though. I’ve bought ingredients like Thai mixed spices, but I rarely use them as Lyndon kicks up a fuss. Curry does not pass his lips – he really dislikes it. He also hates pasta. I try to encourage him to eat foods from around the world, but he just says: “I’m not eating that rubbish.” It’s very narrow-minded. He’s also not fond of quiches or lasagne. He likes me to make a lot of roasts with potatoes, beetroot, cabbage and tomatoes from our garden. He says: “English food is the best.” But I always say: “There’s more out there.” Recently I’ve been sneaking a bit of cayenne pepper into the mince when I make a shepherd’s pie. Lyndon loves it. He will say, “That was tasty,” which I find amusing. I’m 83 now and over the years I’ve learned various ways to be sneaky in our marriage. I will try something new when we eat out, but Lyndon will always stick to what he knows. One time in a restaurant, he sent back a turkey steak because it was too spicy. He made a scene, which I found embarrassing. We both eat differently now compared to when we met in 1955. I’ve become more adventurous, but Lyndon has gone the opposite way. We were just children when the second world war ended, but rationing went on for years. Nobody knew what pizza was. Over the years there has been a food revolution with interesting cuisines available everywhere, which I love. I’ve got Lyndon into frozen pizzas and now he thinks they are very tasty – but he doesn’t like them too often. When I ask him what he likes for dinner, he says: “Cook whatever is easiest.” But if I serve up a lasagne, there’s a chance he will get into a huff. It’s not worth the argument. Lyndon needs to broaden his palate. I’m 87 and like traditional British dishes. I don’t enjoy spicy food, so what’s the point in changing now? Traditional British food is my favourite cuisine. I don’t need my dishes to be of a ridiculously high standard but I like what I like. I’m 87, so really, at my age, what’s the point in changing? I’m not one for curry. I had it a couple of times and I can’t deal with the spice, even when it’s mild. I like my food seasoned but not too much. I don’t want things to be completely bland but I don’t like too many spices or herbs. If we are eating out and I have to foot the bill for something I didn’t enjoy, I’ll be very annoyed. The time I sent back the spicy turkey steak at a restaurant was justified – it was inedible, you couldn’t taste the meat. I know Alice was embarrassed but that’s just how I am. I don’t agree with Alice that I’m a fussy or boring eater. Once we went away to Scotland and ended up at a Thai restaurant, where the food was excellent. I usually stick to what I know, but on that occasion, I felt more adventurous. That doesn’t happen very often, though. Alice enjoys eating different cuisines. That’s fine; we can each do what we like outside the home. Inside it, I think we should stick to what we’ve always done. Every day we have a pudding and I always say to Alice, “Make whatever is easiest”: apple pies, rice pudding, crumbles. I’m not fussy. We’ve been lucky with our health so far and I put that down to eating a varied but traditional British diet. Why fix what’s not broken? I don’t think I’m difficult to cater for. I seldom quibble. If Alice serves a quiche or pasta, I might complain because I find those dishes boring and insubstantial. I prefer meat and two veg as it’s more interesting and balanced. There are times when Alice doesn’t come up to scratch with her cooking, but I won’t say anything. We’ve been married so long there’s no point. And I don’t mind the occasional lasagne or pizza these days. After 63 years, you’re so set in your ways. I won’t be changing my palate. I’m quite happy with the rut we’ve found ourselves in. Is Alice right to try to spice up their food? At 87, Lyndon can be excused for being a bit set in his ways. Alice is obviously more adventurous. However, I think, from bitter experience, that it’s not a case of him disliking spicy food; it’s that he just can’t eat it. I’m going to have to side with the defence.Martin, 70 Lyndon is guilty just for saying “meat and two veg is more interesting”. More interesting than what, exactly – watching paint dry? He is lucky enough to have had Alice cook for him for 63 years, so if her cooking is not up to scratch, maybe it’s time he took a turn in the kitchen.Asiya, 28 The “rut” to which Lyndon refers is one in which both parties are confined. Alice treats him as a recalcitrant child, and Lyndon hasn’t joined the 21st century in terms of believing in “a woman’s place”! A wake-up call is needed for both – age refusing to bestow wisdom.Jane, 77 Lyndon is guilty.

3/25/2022,"If you squinted hard enough into the sunshine at Twickenham on Thursday you could almost see them. The sunlit uplands and, just beyond, the promised land of 2023 Rugby World Cup glory. But that’s the problem with mirages. You end up seeing what you want to see rather than the flashing amber warning signals seemingly visible to everyone except the Rugby Football Union. In his first media briefing for 12 months – if he craves the spotlight he hides it well – the RFU’s chief executive, Bill Sweeney, at least did his best to sell the official vision. All the critics, former coaches, ex-players and social media warriors had got their knickers in a twist unnecessarily. Emperor Eddie Jones is still the man, the England team is still on the right track, nothing to see here, blah blah. For a millisecond it was possible to feel sympathy for Sweeney and his director of performance, Conor O’Shea, as they recited from the same, now familiar hymn sheet. It cannot be hugely enjoyable to have to sit there and spout stuff that has a decent chance of boomeranging back to whack them hard on the back of the head next year. Maybe there would be some prearranged code word or an eye roll to indicate that, actually, they did have a few doubts but were being coerced by some delusional captor? In a media briefing stretching over an hour, sadly, there was no such reassurance. Those suggesting the emperor has precious few clothes left were politely advised to visit Specsavers. In Eddie we should all trust. And so on. There have been slightly less choreographed North Korean weddings, not least when it came to the subject of the planned “review” into England’s latest season of Six Nations underachievement. No surprise there, given the union has already publicly proclaimed – with the grand slam champagne corks still popping in France – that England are making “solid progress” and that Jones is still the way, the truth and the light. Even now they will still not say who will sit on the panel to rubberstamp Jones’s continuing employment because – get this – the individuals concerned want to preserve their anonymity to protect their families from any subsequent unpleasantness. Talk about a compromised jury. “We’re quite comfortable with the panel we have,” murmured Sweeney. And right there is the RFU’s integral problem with Jones. Comfortable? That’s precisely what any self-respecting review should never, ever be. Reviews are about asking uncomfortable questions, not worrying how troublesome the answers might be. The truth, surely, is that Jones’s regime needs more scrutiny, not less. “ Slim margins” repeated O’Shea at regular intervals and of course he is right. Top-level rugby is notoriously unforgiving. England have several fine individual players, with a few more hoping to be back fit soon. But then, bizarrely, it emerged the RFU is trying to shoehorn last season’s July thrashings of the USA and Canada into this season’s stats, rather than last year’s, to improve England’s year-on-year win ratio. No wonder England are underperforming if their senior officials don’t even know what month the season starts. At least there was the odd enlightening snippet, not least hearing Sweeney openly complain that the national team in effect has one hand tied behind it back. “The English structure – everyone is fed up with it,” he shrugged, blaming the domestic logjam of club fixtures for knackering the players before they even reach England’s dressing room. True enough, but you’re the RFU chief executive and you wouldn’t have a competitive side without the Premiership clubs. And are those clubs really to blame for the England head coach’s gameplan? Yet another acrimonious club v country row would appear to be brewing nicely. Then there was the slightly mournful anecdote Sweeney told about meeting Shaun Edwards 18 months ago, after the latter had signed a long‑term deal to be France’s defence coach. Like star-crossed lovers the pair went for a contemplative riverside walk from Teddington to Richmond so that Sweeney “could hear his story”. Which was basically that Edwards had not received a serious offer from England and had relocated to the south of France instead. “Did we miss him there?” asked Sweeney rhetorically. “Possibly.” That is one way of putting it. But don’t panic, Mr Mainwaring. Everything’s fine. “Yes, we do feel in a more confident place than we were 12 months ago,” reiterated Sweeney. So you reckon Jones can still deliver in 2023? “It’s not just emotional or blind faith. Yes, we do.” For better or worse the RFU is now so tightly strapped to Jones’s lurching chariot it can no longer say anything else.",Sport/Sport,Naked truth about RFU exposed by lack of scrutiny for Emperor Jones | Robert Kitson,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/25/eddie-jones-is-still-the-man-with-rfu-england-neglecting-to-apply-more-scrutiny
3/25/2022,"An obscure division of the US government had a busy – and ruthless – year in 2021, killing more than 1.75 million animals across the country, at a rate of around 200 creatures every hour. The latest annual toll of Wildlife Services, a department within the US Department of Agriculture, has further stoked the fury of conservation groups that have decried the killings as cruel and pointless. Wildlife Services maintains the slaughter is necessary to protect agricultural output, threatened species and human health. The 2021 toll shows the killings span a Noah’s Ark of species, spanning alligators, armadillos, doves, owls, otters, porcupines, snakes and turtles. European starlings alone accounted for more than 1m of the animals killed. A single moose was shot, along with a solitary antelope and, accidentally, a bald eagle. Wildlife Services targets certain invasive species that it considers a threat to ecosystems, such as feral hogs and a type of giant swamp rodent called nutria, but it also, controversially, kills vast numbers of America’s native species. Last year, 404,538 native animals were killed by the agency, a compendium of snuffed out life that included 324 gray wolves, 64,131 coyotes, 433 black bears, 200 mountain lions, 605 bobcats, 3,014 foxes and 24,687 beavers. Plenty of animals are killed unintentionally, too, with 2,746 unfortunate creatures, including bears, foxes and dogs, exterminated by accident last year. This is partly down to the methods used by Wildlife Services, which deploys leg hold traps, snares and poisons to target animals. The agency uses a variety of other approaches too, such as rounding up and gassing geese or shooting coyotes from helicopters or aircraft. “It’s stomach-turning to see this barbaric federal program wiping out hundreds of thousands of native animals,” said Collette Adkins, carnivore conservation director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “Killing carnivores like wolves and coyotes to supposedly benefit the livestock industry just leads to more conflicts and more killing. This is a truly vicious cycle, and we’ll continue to demand change from Wildlife Services.” Last year’s death toll was, in fact, fairly low by the standards of recent years. In both 2008 and 2010, Wildlife Services killed 5m animals, and as recently as 2019 it killed around 1.3m native animals, a total much higher than last year. Wildlife Services, which has a mission to “resolve wildlife conflicts to allow people and wildlife to coexist”, often acts at the behest of ranchers, state agencies and airports to eradicate animals considered to be damaging to the environment, economic activity or public safety. But this approach has long been opposed by conservationists who argue the killings are indiscriminate and degrade America’s environment. The targeting of predators such as coyotes and bears, for example, can disrupt ecosystems and even aid the spread of invasive species. Various and pieces of legislation have failed to curb Wildlife Services’ activities, however, although opposition has placed restrictions in some states, such as California and Washington. Most contentious is the department’s use of M-44 cyanide “bombs” to kill certain animals. The devices, described by Wildlife Services as an “effective and environmentally sound wildlife damage management tool”, are essentially canisters placed in landscapes that eject a cloud of sodium cyanide when tugged at by animals. It will typically kill foxes, coyotes and other targeted species within five minutes. The use of M-44 canisters can go awry, however, such as when pet dogs inadvertently trigger them. In 2017, a 14-year-old boy, Canyon Mansfield, was covered by the toxic powder when he encountered one of the devices while walking his dog Kasey behind his home in Pacatello, Idaho. The incident injured Mansfield and killed his dog, prompting calls by environmentalists, so far rebuffed by the federal government, to ban the use of M-44s. “M-44 cyanide ejectors jeopardize animals and people alike, and a nationwide ban is long overdue,” said Carson Barylak, campaigns manager at the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW).",News/World news,‘A barbaric federal program’: US killed 1.75m animals last year – or 200 per hour,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/25/us-government-wildlife-services-animals-deaths
3/25/2022,"Abitter February night at Griffin Park in 2007. A friendly between Nigeria and Ghana, as though such a thing were possible. Ghana had not beaten their neighbours in 15 years but when Nigerian defences cracked, they collapsed. It was 0-0 at half-time but then Laryea Kingson, Sulley Muntari and Junior Agogo struck between the 50th and 60th minutes. It was a lot less than 10 minutes of playing time given the gleeful pitch invasions that followed each goal. The game finished 4-1, well over an hour later than scheduled, thanks to a delayed start for a larger than expected crowd and the frequent interruptions (a personal confession: I queued for more than an hour at an overwhelmed press entrance with the Observer’s then-sports editor Brian Oliver, before giving up and hopping over a barrier, ripping my coat as I did so). In his final game as Nigeria coach before being replaced by Berti Vogts, Augustine Eguavoen just about retained his dignity in a ferocious post-match press conference. For 15 minutes the Nigerian media tore into him before he called a halt by suggesting that because the Ghana coach, Claude Le Roy, who had been awkwardly sitting alongside him throughout, had turned 59 the previous day, everybody should sing “happy birthday”, which they lustily did. It was a night of unforgettable and glorious chaos, but in hindsight perhaps the most memorable aspect was the Ghanaian radio commentator whose voice dominated the press box. “More than 15 years! More than 15 years!” he bellowed at the final whistle. “It will be more than 15 years before they beat us again.” He was right. Nigeria have not beaten Ghana since. But more than 15 years have passed and as the two great rivals prepare for Friday’s first leg of their World Cup qualifying play-off, it is Ghana who look to be in an even bigger mess than Nigeria. The intertwined sporting histories of the nations began in the 1930s, before either existed in their present form, with ‘inter-colonial’ events in football, boxing and tennis. When Ethel Jacks became African women’s table-tennis champion in 1964, she was competing as a Ghanaian; 12 years later, when she finally surrendered her crown, she was representing the land of her birth, Nigeria. The Cudgoe brothers were born in Ghana but played football for Nigeria. Alex Quist and his brother Anthony at various times played football and cricket for both nations against the other. The Kwame Nkrumah leadership in Ghana (or the Gold Coast, as it then was) soon recognised the propaganda potential of sport and matches against Nigeria, who were still perceived as playing sport in “the effete English manner” – to quote an editorial in the Nigerian daily Vanguard – began to take on additional edge. Ghana quickly established themselves as the major power of west African football, players such as Wilberforce Mfum and Opoku Afriyie helping them to three Cups of Nations before Nigeria, emerging from civil war, claimed their first, in 1980. Two years later, as though making a point, Ghana won it again. In Barcelona in 1992, Ghana became the first African country to win a football medal at the Olympics; four years later in Atlanta, Nigeria took gold. Nigeria’s performances at the 1994 and 1998 World Cups won global appreciation and meant they were unquestionably the best side in west Africa, despite politics preventing them from competing at the 1996 and 1998 Cups of Nations. Until 2006, the familiar taunt from Nigeria fans was that Ghana had never qualified for a World Cup, although that was largely because of a lack of African representation at the tournament before 1982. Twice, in 1960 and 1972, Ghana had beaten Nigeria in World Cup qualifiers – the latter victory coming after rioting in Lagos forced the game to be abandoned with five minutes remaining. This latest chapter in the rivalry comes after Ghana suffered an embarrassing Cup of Nations campaign in Cameroon. Milovan Rajevac, who had led Ghana to the final of the tournament in 2010, was mysteriously appointed coach in September but as even the president of the Ghana Football Association Kurt Okraku acknowledged, he had little time to work with his squad. The result was a series of dismal performances culminating in a 3-2 defeat to Comoros that eliminated them in the group stage. Rajevac was promptly sacked. Chris Hughton was named as technical director, although exactly where his role ends and that of the interim coach, Otto Addo, begins is unclear. That is only the beginning of the confusion, with André Ayew and Benjamin Tetteh suspended and Jordan Ayew testing positive for Covid, although he was included in the squad that was finally announced in the early hours of Tuesday morning, after a planned Monday launch on the controversial GFA app was abandoned. The first leg had initially been scheduled for the 20,000-capacity Cape Coast Sports Stadium and there had been some talk that after the draw the GFA had wanted to move to a larger arena, only to be thwarted by CAF regulations that venues have to be set a minimum 90 days in advance. Independence Day celebrations staged by the Ghana government on 6 March damaged the pitch to such an extent that despite the release of some optimistically Photoshopped images CAF has agreed the game can be switched to the 40,000-capacity Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi. Nigeria’s chaos is relatively low-key by comparison. Gernot Rohr was sacked as coach on 13 December, after which the president of the Nigerian Football Federation, Amaju Pinnick, announced that the Portuguese coach José Peseiro, who was supposed to be attached to the team at the Cup of Nations in an observer’s role, would take over. But Peseiro was not in Cameroon and it turned out his contract might not be quite as signed as Pinnick had intimated so the interim who led Nigeria to a last-16 exit stays on: Augustine Eguavoen, implausibly, finds himself facing Ghana again with the chance to put right what went wrong in Brentford 15 years ago. And it’s not Hughton’s or Addo’s birthday any time soon.",Sport/Football,Nigeria out to scratch 15-year itch against Ghana in clash of great rivals ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/25/nigeria-ghana-world-cup-play-off-rivals-clash
3/25/2022,"It was always a little tough to buy the legitimacy of Jane Campion’s dark slow-burn drama The Power of the Dog as the best picture frontrunner. A difficult film about festering familial resentment and the destructive wounds of forced masculinity, it was a world away from what we’re used to seeing the notoriously risk-averse Academy rewarding, or even nominating in the first place. There’s a distinct, unsettling chill that we haven’t experienced in a winner since 2007’s No Country for Old Men (Campion herself has likened the effect of the two endings), every Oscar since going to something that can be broadly, warmly defined as “the film we need right now”, laughs, tears or both guaranteed by the credits. But during a season that’s been mostly more conventional than last year’s, the film has remained out front despite the lack of a “worthy” narrative (star Benedict Cumberbatch’s late-in-the-day attempt to claim his character represents “anyone who hasn’t been seen or heard or understood” is … a stretch). It seemed too good to be true – it was far and away the most compelling film of 2021 – and the recent surge for the inauthentic saccharine of string-pulling remake Coda (winning both PGA and WGA awards over the last weekend) suggests that maybe it is, heart winning over any other part of the body yet again. Yet big win or not, the recognition awarded to The Power of the Dog (it leads the pack with 12 nominations) marks a victory, not just for films that stimulate rather than sedate but for queer films at large. A considerable swathe of critics might have pretzeled themselves into not defining it as such but it remains an overwhelmingly, fascinatingly, unavoidably gay movie in a murkier way that we’re not used to seeing during awards season. The queer experience – as with many other experiences outside being straight, white and male – is too often flattened, softened and packaged into something more palatable and edgeless for all to understand and relate to. But Campion refuses to compromise or condescend, presenting gayness as challenging and unfinished and, vitally, existing on a vast spectrum. The generational conflict and then complicated connection between Cumberbatch’s older repressed rancher Phil and Kodi Smit McPhee’s cooly confident Peter represents so much that’s uncomfortably familiar to many gay men without ever being strictly defined. Is there jealousy? Is there desire? Is there a need to protect? Is there a need to destroy? Campion’s delicate, if divisive, script allows for multiple interpretations. There’s been an ill-fitting unease to the majority of Cumberbatch’s Ay-mare-reek-un work but it’s exactly this tension that makes him so perfect as Phil, cosplaying as someone to hide who he really is; the sad, fake swagger of a man desperate not to give himself away, a reluctant survival tactic that many queer people will be able to recall. It’s the best he’s ever been, deserving of his second Oscar nomination and perhaps first win, complemented by three similarly astute and nominated performances. His unpredictable, and ultimately unknowable, chemistry with an otherworldly Smit-McPhee unfurls on a knife’s edge, sinister at times and heart-shattering at others (the last act moment of Phil, seemingly aware of what Peter has done to him, weakly waiting to give him the rope he’s made, is devastating). It takes place alongside his cruelty towards Peter’s mother, Rose, a never-better Kirsten Dunst, ratcheted up tightly and crescendoing in a hideous dinner party scene, a crushing piece of acting that should guarantee her the Oscar by itself. We see progressively less of his decaying brotherly bond with Jesse Plemons’ George, but the little we have seen tells us everything of their rot, a relationship built entirely on fragile shards of memories, not enough to sustain them into adulthood when the unspoken becomes so much louder than what is being said. For some viewers, and I imagine for many voters, Campion’s bark has been too quiet – the story too obtuse, the emotions too restrained and the tone too removed – and this inscrutability, coupled with a big, all-eyes release on Netflix, has led to a constant low-level hum of discontent (there may also be enough Sam Elliotts in the Academy to count against it at the final hurdle for other, gayer reasons). But unlike so many other desperate-to-be-loved films of this or any other Oscar season, The Power of the Dog never once craves universality. You either see what Phil does in the hills or you don’t.",Arts/Film,Why The Power of the Dog should win the best picture Oscar,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/25/why-the-power-of-the-dog-should-win-the-best-picture-oscar
3/25/2022,"Universities face escalating threats to students and to national security from hostile forces, a report into foreign interference has warned. A parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security inquiry found examples of attempts to threaten and intimidate staff and students, espionage, and intellectual property theft through collaborations with foreign institutions. Liberal senator James Paterson, committee chair, said there had been a “sustained campaign of intimidation, harassment, censorship and intelligence gathering” that has led to “the transfer of sensitive research to military regimes”. The report, released on Friday, specifically singled out Chinese government-funded Confucius Institutes, a $10m deal between Monash University and a Chinese company linked to industrial espionage, and talent recruitment drives that see Australian researchers work with universities overseas. The Morrison government launched the inquiry in 2020 amid broader concerns about foreign interference in Australia, and media reports about Australia-China collaborations potentially leading to sensitive defence technology being shared. Universities raised concerns at the time about a range of new government powers and how they would balance with the need for global engagement on research and development. On Friday Universities Australia, the peak body, said universities were “very alive” to the risks of foreign interference and were working with governments and security agencies to tackle the issues. “We will continue to lead the way in ensuring that Australia is collaborating with world leading researchers and institutions as we strive for the big breakthroughs, whilst managing and mitigating risks,” chief executive Catriona Jackson said. Asio told the inquiry the university and higher education sector was a target and that “hostile intelligence activity continues to pose a real threat to Australia, our sovereignty and the integrity of our national institutions”. Hostile entities sought insights into Australia’s alliances, access to privileged information, and commercial advantage. Asio also said openness was “integral” to universities and that foreign intelligence services took advantage of that to “steal intellectual property and cutting-edge technologies”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The inquiry heard there were more than 100 cyber-attacks on universities in 2019-20, including attempts to steal IP data related to Covid-19 vaccines. It was told researchers and their families were threatened by foreign actors wanting access to their sensitive research, and that students had been threatened by outsiders as well as fellow students. In one case, a student on a Zoom meeting displaying a Hong Kong independence flag was told by another student they would be reported. “Hostile foreign intelligence services have directly threatened and intimidated Australians in our country,” Asio said. The home affairs department said other countries were cultivating and manipulating people, spreading propaganda, pressuring people and silencing dissent. The inquiry heard that the Chinese-government backed Confucius Institutes within universities were a “Trojan horse” for the Chinese Communist party, and that the cultural and language programs were part of a propaganda strategy. The report recommended that universities that host Confucius Institutes should reveal the details of their agreements, with the universities given a final say on staff, and curricula, and that agreements have clauses protecting academic freedom and freedom of speech. Recruitment programs such as China’s Thousand Talents program could be used as “possible avenues of technology transfer and espionage”, the inquiry heard, and more transparency was needed. The committee raised concerns about an ongoing partnership between Monash University and the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China. Comac has been linked to industrial espionage. Monash and Comac are collaborating on commercial airline technology, but the committee warned such technology could be “dual use … where apparently innocent research has been used for military applications”. It should not go ahead as “a matter of principle”, it said, recommending that foreign minister, Marise Payne, decide what to do about it. That was just one of several collaborations brought to the committee’s attention, and the report’s 27 recommendations focused on increased awareness of danger areas, monitoring and reporting of issues, transparency and training rather than legislation. The unanimous recommendations included better reporting and documenting of intimidation and censorship as well as new penalties for foreign interference such as reporting on fellow students to foreign governments. The committee also called for an audit of Australian Research Council grants that might be exposed to grant fraud and to risks from talent recruitment programs. Up to 120 separate pieces of commonwealth and state legislation already exist to regulate potential foreign interference, and a university foreign interference taskforce has been set up to guide universities with the help of governments and agencies. Sophie McNeill, from Human Rights Watch, welcomed the report and said HRW looked forward to working with universities to help students and staff feel “a new sense of protection and freedom”. “These new efforts to ensure universities have clear policies in place to counter state-backed harassment and intimidation and the resulting self-censorship are long overdue and have the potential to make a real, positive difference on the lives of students and academics,” she said. In its notes, the committee said the higher education sector “must move from a benign operating environment for our adversaries to a hardened environment”, without losing independence. “The sector, with government assistance, should create an environment where hostile activity is unfeasible, too expensive, or too risky to undertake,” it said.",News/Australia news,"University students and staff face increasing threats, foreign interference inquiry finds",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/25/university-students-and-staff-face-increasing-threats-foreign-interference-inquiry-finds
