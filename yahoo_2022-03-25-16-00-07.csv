3/25/2022,"Clarence Thomas' wife Ginni reportedly texted Mark Meadows urging him to overturn the 2020 election. The news prompted scrutiny on Thomas' lone dissent in a ruling rejecting Trump's bid to withhold docs from the Jan. 6 House panel. The New York Times previously reported that Ginni Thomas had ties to organizers of the Jan. 6 rally, which she has denied. In January, the Supreme Court rejected former President Donald Trump's bid to block the release of some presidential records to the House committee investigating the Capitol riot in a near unanimous 8-1 vote. Only one justice dissented: Clarence Thomas. At the time, the justice provided no explanation for why he would have approved Trump's request — a standard omission when the top court addresses emergency motions. But Thomas' objection fell under scrutiny on Thursday after The Washington Post reported that the justice's wife, Virginia ""Ginni"" Thomas, sent multiple text messages to former White House chief of Staff Mark Meadows urging him to overturn the 2020 presidential election in the aftermath of Trump's loss to President Joe Biden. In a message from November 6, 2020, Ginni Thomas told Meadows not to concede the election, saying ""it takes time for the army who is gathering for his back."" In a message on November 10, 2020, Ginni Thomas declared Biden's win ""the greatest Heist of our History."" In total, Ginni Thomas and Meadows exchanged 29 texts between November 2020 and January 2021, the outlet reported, all of which are now part of the trove of evidence the January 6 panel is investigating. The committee obtained the texts from Meadows, CNN reported Thursday. The former Trump White House chief of staff reportedly turned over thousands of text messages before he stopped cooperating with the panel late last year. Ahead of the Supreme Court's order on Trump's White House documents, Meadows filed a supporting brief in favor of blocking the release of documents. Ginni Thomas, a longtime conservative activist, has come under fire in recent months related to her reportedly having ties to organizers of the rally that preceded the attack, which she denied. Earlier this month, she acknowledged that she attended the ""Stop the Steal"" rally but said she got cold and left before Trump spoke. She also denied having ties to the organizers of the event. Her comments came after multiple news outlets reported that Ginni Thomas was connected to January 6 rally organizers and served on the board of a conservative group that promoted overturning the 2020 election results. Ginni Thomas has long been an active participant in partisan politics despite her husband's role on the nation's highest court. In a recent interview with the Washington Free Beacon, she said the couple has their ""own separate careers, and our own ideas and opinions too."" ""Clarence doesn't discuss his work with me, and I don't involve him in my work,"" she said. Insider reached out to Meadows and Ginni Thomas for comment.

3/25/2022,"A small business owner in Chicago has made the decision to permanently close her shop after a recent burglary and constant harassment.

Jessica Nguyen, the owner of Jessica’s Boutique, located in Chicago’s West Beverly neighborhood, recently fell victim to a robbery that caused her to lose over $30,000.

According to police, the unidentified thief broke into the store on March 19 at around 3:15 a.m. Some of the stolen items included designer sunglasses, clothes and purses.

Nguyen’s husband, Loren Watkins, told CBS Chicago that the thief was able to remain in the store for about 15 minutes due to the alarm system not working. Watkins said that the thief was walking around the store as if he was “in the park or something.”

The store owner also added that another reason she decided to close the store was due to the constant harassment that she had been receiving as an Asian since the COVID-19 pandemic started.

“I’ve gotten a lot of harassment,” Nguyen said. “I felt very sad because this area is a very good area.”

Nguyen is now hoping to sell all of her store’s products by the end of the year and to recreate the space into something different.

Chicago police said that they have not yet caught the suspect and will release the suspect’s image through a community alert once they have more information. Enjoy this content?

3/25/2022,"NEW ORLEANS (AP) — A 21-year-old man accused of killing a high school student and the teen’s stepsister was gunned down on his way to a pretrial hearing, and his mother was critically wounded, the man's attorney said. John Fuller said he believes Hollis Carter was shot in the head on Wednesday in connection with a killing that he says his late client had not committed, The Times-Picayune / The New Orleans Advocate reported. “Street justice has resulted in an assurance that there would never be any closure in this case,” Fuller said. New Orleans police have said Carter confessed to killing Caleb Johnson, 18, and Breyiana Brown, 25, and wounding a third person in a gun sale gone bad on the city's west bank last March. Fuller said he had planned to argue in court that Carter made that statement because he was afraid of the actual killer. The district attorney’s office would not comment on that defense, saying the case is still open, the newspaper reported. Police, who have not identified Carter as the victim, said the man was shot Wednesday morning while his car was waiting at a stop light, and his passenger fell into the street as the car rolled forward. Mike Smith, an assistant pastor at Bethel Community Baptist Church, said employees at a church-operated car wash told him that someone “unloaded” a gun into the car, firing at least eight shots. Carter, free on $375,000 bond, had been due in court for a status hearing on two counts of second-degree murder and one count of attempted second-degree murder. Fuller said he is committed to prove that Carter was innocent. ""He doesn’t deserve to have his obituary tainted by what were basically false charges,” Fuller said.",U.S./Associated Press,Attorney: Client killed on way to hearing on murder charges,https://news.yahoo.com/attorney-client-killed-way-hearing-214905011.html
