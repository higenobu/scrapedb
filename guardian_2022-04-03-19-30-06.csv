4/3/2022,"Rishi Sunak and his wife, Akshata Murthy, met while studying for a master in business administration qualification at Stanford University in Silicon Valley. After marrying in a lavish ceremony in India, the couple planned to settle down in California and bought a penthouse flat in Santa Monica. The flat, which the couple are reported to be visiting over the Easter holidays, is valued at $7.2m (£5.5m) by US property website Redfin and boasts sweeping views of the world-famous Santa Monica pier and the Pacific ocean beyond. Murthy, the daughter of the billionaire founder of Infosys, the Indian tech giant, bought the penthouse apartment – one of four in the Waverly complex on Ocean Avenue – directly from the developer in June 2014. Estate agents for the six-storey building, built in 2013, boast that the penthouses come with “large private outdoor terraces unlike anything ever seen before on Ocean Avenue”. Residents are promised the apartments will provide “the epitome of urban Santa Monica beach living” with “stunning views of the Santa Monica mountain” and where you “wake up to the sound of waves crashing against the shore”. The building, designed by KTGY architects and with interiors by LA designers Marmol Radziner, offers an around-the-clock concierge and a fitness centre “stocked with the latest equipment for those looking to improve their cardiovascular or muscular endurance”. There is even a “pet spa” where residents’ “furry companions can get pampered”. “All units face north so you don’t wake up with sun coming in your face and get to end the day capturing a stunning sunset over the Pacific,” the marketing material promises. Kitchens feature “polished Sea Pearl quartzite counters” and custom-built oak cabintery with polished chrome hardware and stainless steel Thermador appliances. “The showers have glass walls designed with a tortoise shell mosaic pattern,” another estate agent says. “In the powder rooms, the countertops are deluxe marble and the vanity is custom-designed.” Should the Sunaks wish to pop out for a bite to eat, the five-star Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel is across the street, offering campfire-inspired fire-pit dining. A 6oz filet mignon steak costs $54 or a plate of seared steelhead salmon is $36. Santa Monica is the sixth most expensive address in the US, with median average house prices hitting $4.1m in November 2021, according to data from Property Shark. Celebrities often seen on or around Santa Monica’s “muscle beach” include Ben Affleck, Reese Witherspoon, Taylor Swift, Kim Kardashian and Kayne West.",News/Politics,"Sunaks’ £5m Santa Monica flat offers sun, sea … and a pet spa",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/03/sunaks-5m-santa-monica-flat-offers-sun-sea-and-a-pet-spa
4/3/2022,"The ground in Cedar Valley is sinking and splintering. Fissures that snake through the region are a visible sign of Utah’s water woes, and the result of years spent overdrawing from an underground aquifer that supplies the area. And yet Cedar City, at the heart of the valley, continues to grow. Visitors flock to nearby national parks such as Zion and Bryce Canyon, adding to the flow of new residents expected to move here in the coming years. Cedar City is already the most populous in Utah’s Iron county, and finding more water has become an existential quest. Local officials have landed on a controversial solution – siphoning it from under an undeveloped valley to the north in neighboring Beaver county. Laced with scientific uncertainty, the proposal has united environmentalists, ranchers, tribes and officials from other counties in opposition. Supporters, meanwhile, say the city has a legal right to the groundwater and that it is essential for its growth and survival. The battle is just the latest frontline in the water wars of the American west that have defined Utah’s history. The outcome could have far-reaching implications for the parched landscapes and the people, plants and animals that dwell on them. “In the west we have the three W’s man will fight for until the day we are all gone – that’s whiskey, women and water,” says Mark Whitney, the commission chair of Beaver county, wryly echoing an old adage he says has circulated for centuries. But as the west dries and its most essential resource grows scarce, this battle may be a glimpse of the future rather than a reflection of the past. Cedar City, tucked between arid ranges and pine-covered red-rock mountains, has a historic downtown that caters to its tourists and roughly 35,000 residents. The scenic city is small by most standards, and officials claim they lack the resources to conserve water the way larger cities like Las Vegas and Los Angeles do. But they aren’t the first to seek out new supply even as water levels shrink across the west. “That’s the problem in the whole state right now,” Whitney . “There are too many straws stuck in the ground.” Cedar City’s proposal is the culmination of decades of legal challenges. The Central Iron County Water Conservancy District (CICWCD), which supplies water to Cedar City and its surrounding areas, filed for water rights in three valleys outside the county back in 2006. Litigation went on for years amid opposition, before a 2019 settlement cleared the way for the agency to seek federal approval to begin pumping. The project, still awaiting the all-clear from the Bureau of Land Management, would kick off in Pine Valley, where the CICWCD plans to pump 15,000 acre-feet of water – or nearly 5bn gallons – a year. It would also include a new 200-acre solar facility exclusively built to power the project, and a roughly 70-mile pipeline that, if approved, will traverse across public lands. The plan comes at a desperate time. The south-west is experiencing the driest period in more than 1,200 years, according to scientists, and Utah is one of the driest states in the country. Even now, in early spring, more than a third of the state is classified in extreme drought by the US Drought Monitor. Driven by the climate crisis and development, temperatures are also spiking, which will only speed up scarcity. But Whitney says the battle to protect his county’s water isn’t just about politics. It’s science. Pulling more water out from the undeveloped systems could have far-reaching effects that even extend across state lines. Some models question whether enough water exists in Pine Valley to fulfill what the agency plans to pump. “You can own all the water in the world,” he said, “but if it’s not there, it’s not there.” The water in question flows hundreds of feet beneath the hard desert earth, tucked between mountain ranges along the Utah-Nevada border. As part of a broader system, the groundwater in the valley basins across the region sustains nearby streams and small wetlands. The area is sparsely populated, but cattle that roam these ranges share natural spring water with wild horses, elk and antelope. Coyotes and foxes traverse the wildlands used as nesting sites for migratory birds and eagles. The valleys are also habitat to species with dwindling numbers, including the greater sage grouse, the Utah prairie dog and springsnails. Krista Kemppinen, a senior scientist with the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental advocacy organization that opposes the project, also points to a tiny imperiled fish called the least chub. Some scientists believe the project will push it closer to extinction, with irreversible effects. “Even when you lose just one species, that can disrupt an entire ecosystem,” said Kemppinen. But opinions differ on how drastically these landscapes – and those who rely on them – will be affected once the water is pulled out from under them. Driving that uncertainty is the fact that scientists and officials aren’t exactly sure where the water flows now, and which landscapes stand to lose if the groundwater is redirected. With so many variables at play, projections can change dramatically when models account for shifts in precipitation, runoff or heat that affects evaporation and dryness. The BLM’s draft environmental assessment, which relies on data and analysis compiled by federal scientists and a contractor hired by the CICWCD, predicts that the proposal will have limited effects outside the project area. But Paul Briggs, BLM’s field manager for Cedar City, says there is “absolutely uncertainty” about long-term effects. “We can’t see underneath the ground any better than anybody else and we are very upfront about that in the analysis,” said Briggs. “We won’t know the exact impacts of something like this until we are several years into the development and pumping of it.”Earlier models from the US Geological Survey paint a more problematic picture. In a 2019 report, the agency concluded that the valley in question may yield less than 75% of the water the agency hopes to acquire each year. The drawdown could pull water from connected basins, affecting areas far from the project itself. Scientists say the taps may be hard to turn off once the changes to the water system are put into play. A separate analysis conducted by the Great Basin Water Network, a coalition of water conservation advocates who oppose the plan, which relied on the USGS data, found that the project “could result in lasting water resource impacts” to surrounding valleys and the ecosystems that depend on them, possibly even stretching into Great Basin national park and Fish Springs national wildlife refuge. Briggs emphasized that monitoring and mitigation plans will be put in place if it is approved, adding that he believes the agency is relying on the best science to make a decision. But others aren’t as confident. While few people call this land home, those that do say the cost could be high. Mark Wintch, a multi-generational rancher in the adjoining Wah Wah Valley, is worried about the natural spring that waters both cattle and crops and produces hydroelectricity that runs the ranch and his house, where he and his wife have raised six kids. If the proposal moves forward, that spring is going to run dry. “My family has run this operation since 1898,” Wintch said. “This project has the potential to take everything away.” Paul Monroe, the general manager of the CICWCD, counters the claims of ecological breakdown, citing the layers of contingency plans being put in place to protect the environment. The district is prepared to slow pumping if unforeseen consequences arise. And, he said, there’s a lot at stake if the project doesn’t move forward. Local water use, which was already close to triple the national average in 2020, has been on the rise. The state has finally cracked down on Cedar City’s overdrawing of its aquifer, limiting what can be pumped in the years to come. “Not only do we have an issue of supplying water for the growth that has been coming but we really won’t have enough water in the future for our current residents who are here now,” Monroe said. Critics have called on the agency to do more to conserve rather than search out new sources of supply. Monroe claims there has been progress, noting that the county is installing basins to collect runoff water and creating new reservoirs for rural use, which he says accounts for most of their consumption. There are also plans for diverting more treated sewer water for irrigation so farmers can idle their underground wells. But, he claims, the rural municipalities lack the resources to tighten their belts further and conservation alone won’t be enough to sustain the city. After years of waiting, officials are eager to tap into new supply. “We know our standing,” Monroe said, adding that they had done everything by the book. “We are moving forward with the project.” Kyle Roerink, the executive director of the Great Basin Water Network, doesn’t buy the idea that the agency will turn off the taps if things go awry. “They drained their own aquifer in their own community,” he said. “Can we trust them to be responsible stewards of water that they are importing?” Opponents also have questions about whether the state was legally able to issue the rights to water underneath Beaver county. Pine Valley, where the project is planned, was also once home to Indigenous nations who now claim they were not adequately consulted and that their water rights on the land have historically been violated and ignored. “That water is ours – it just has not been adjudicated,” said Tamra Borchardt-Slayton, chairperson of Indian Peaks Band of the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah. The draft environmental impact statement references comments from tribes and bands throughout the region who raised concerns about how the project will affect their ancestral land, cultural resources and tribal water rights. Briggs, from the BLM, said the agency has worked closely with tribes and that communication has been open and ongoing. But Borchardt-Slayton describes the BLM consultation as inadequate. “They essentially erased us from that area,” she said. Rancher Wintch, meanwhile, fears that even if this project is halted, it’s still a sign of what lies ahead as continued growth collides with age-old water conflicts in this remote corner of the south-west. “The biggest takeaway is that water really was the gold rush of the west and it’s the most valuable thing we have,” he says. “It’s so precious and we have got to protect it.”",News/US news,A Utah town is running dry.

4/3/2022,"It has cost £840m to develop and taken 15 years to build. But now fears are mounting that the British-built robot rover – which was to have flown on Europe’s ExoMars mission in September – may never make it to the red planet. The craft was to have drilled deep below the Martian surface to collect samples that could bear signs of past or present life, but had its launch on a giant Russian Proton rocket postponed last month after the invasion of Ukraine. At best, the rover – built in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, and financed by the European Space Agency – will have to wait two more years, when the next window opens for sending a spacecraft to Mars. However, some astronomers fear that prospects for the rover, named after the British DNA pioneer Rosalind Franklin, now look grim. If delays continue, it could ultimately be mothballed, scientists have warned. “It is inconceivable that we can work with Russia under present circumstances, and that attitude is going to last a long time,” said astronomer Professor John Zarnecki of the Open University. “This could delay ExoMars for the rest of the decade. By then, its technology will be getting dated.” The alternative would be to find another launcher. However, such a move poses other problems. Russia was also supplying the Kazachok lander that was to settle the Rosalind Franklin safely on the planet’s surface. “First, a huge parachute would have decelerated the craft as it descended through the Martian atmosphere. Then Kazachok’s retro rockets would have further slowed it down so the rover could land gently,” said Professor Andrew Coates, of University College London. “It is an extremely tricky, complex manoeuvre and designing a replacement landing system will not be easy,” added Coates, who is principal investigator for the rover’s panoramic camera experiment. Previous Martian rovers have managed to scrape soil samples from a depth of only about 6cm. “That is the key feature of this mission,” said Coates. “We will be bringing samples from depths of two metres, where any signs of life are going to be better protected from the cosmic rays that batter Mars’ surface.” Several dozen planetary scientists in Britain have been involved in work on ExoMars – including Áine O’Brien, at Glasgow University. “It’s a weird experience for all of us,” she told the Observer. “We are sad because of what has happened to our work and the chance of being involved in searching for life on Mars but you also feel guilty for feeling sad – because, among everything else, it’s a really minor setback compared with what the people of Ukraine are suffering.” While some scientists remain relatively optimistic that Europe and Russia might cooperate in space again, others remain doubtful. “If it ends up being postponed until the end of the decade, as we hunt for new launchers and develop new landing systems, then the mission will all start to look old,” said Robert Massey of the Royal Astronomical Society. “That is why there is speculation now that it might never fly.” This view was backed by O’Brien: “In the end, we may have to cut our losses and concentrate on other Mars missions.” Nor is ExoMars likely to be the only casualty of the invasion of Ukraine. Russia provides relatively cheap but powerful rockets that have been used to launch many European missions in the past. Immediate victims of the suspension of future launches will include two Galileo navigation satellites , while The ESA’s EarthCare science mission, developed in cooperation with the Japanese space agency, Jaxa, and the Euclid infrared space telescope will also be affected. More perplexing is the likely impact on the International Space Station, which relies on a Russian propulsion system to boost away from Earth as its orbit decays and to move it to avoid space debris. Should Russia pull out of the ISS, then the vast orbiting laboratory would slowly spiral lower and lower until it crashed. This threat was recently made explicit by Dmitry Rogozin, the head of the Russian space agency, Roscosmos. Russia would determine on its own “how long the ISS will operate”, he told the country’s state news agency, Tass.",News/Science,UK Mars rover is casualty of war as science severs its links with Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/03/uk-mars-rover-is-casualty-of-war-as-science-severs-its-links-with-russia
4/3/2022,"As the Biden administration announced on Friday plans to end Covid-related restrictions for undocumented people arriving at the southern border, it guaranteed that irregular immigration will return as even more of a polarizing, point-scoring, policy debate. And as the US hurtles toward midterm elections, another prescient anniversary looms this week. April 6 marks four years since the Trump administration announced its “zero tolerance” policy, the mechanism through which it separated almost 4,000 children from their families in what was widely condemned as an inhumane deterrence effort. Since the practice ended a few months after it was rolled out amid outcry, border policy has lurched from one extreme strategy to another. From “Remain in Mexico”, which pushes asylum seekers back across the border while their cases are processed, to Title 42, the public health order that has allowed border officials to rapidly expel migrants due to the Covid-19 pandemic, before they could claim asylum. On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced the policy will finally end on 23 May. It had been sanctioned by Donald Trump, amid lobbying from senior adviser Stephen Miller, but continued into the Biden era, with the majority of the 1.7 million expulsions under Title 42 occurring under the current president. Joe Biden only recently moved to exclude unaccompanied minors from the sweeping program. Child separation. Remain in Mexico. The use of Title 42. All separate policies born of the same administration and indicative of a profound, hard-right assault on the right to claim asylum in the US. “The end of the cruel and anti-immigrant policy of using Title 42 to expel vulnerable asylum seekers under public health provisions is long overdue,” said Allen Orr, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association in a statement. “The thousands upon thousands of migrants, from babies to grandmothers, who were illegally expelled before being allowed to have a meaningful chance to claim protection under our laws merit an acknowledgment that the US got it wrong.” Before the announcement to end use of Title 42 was made by the Biden administration this week, the White House acknowledged that winding down the provisions would probably lead to an increase in arrivals at the southern border. “We are planning for multiple contingencies, and we have every expectation that when the CDC ultimately decides it’s appropriate to lift Title 42, there will be an influx of people to the border,” said the White House communications director, Kate Bedingfield, at a press briefing on Wednesday. The Department of Homeland Security has said it is preparing to manage as many as 18,000 encounters on the border a day and is preparing to surge staff to the region to assist with enforcement and detention. But, say advocates and lawyers operating in the region, such a rise in numbers is probably a direct consequence of the outgoing policy itself. They point to the fact that many of those expected arrivals will be from people seeking asylum who were previously barred from doing so over the past two years. “A post-Title 42 world at the border is simply a return to lawful processing under the asylum system that was set up by Congress decades ago,” said Shaw Drake, a staff attorney at the ACLU Texas, speaking to the Guardian shortly before the CDC announcement on Friday. “When you spend the first year or more of your administration expelling over a million people then you are setting yourself up for an increase in people arriving to the border once that policy is lifted,” Drake, who is based in El Paso, added. “Because … you expelled people who otherwise may have had protection claims that they need to continue in the US to protect themselves from ongoing persecution and danger.” Many of those expelled under the policy have returned to camps along the border where extortion, kidnapping and violence are routinely reported, according to lawyers. “In any given border city [in Mexico] there are thousands of migrants some of whom have been there for over a year, already returned under Title 42,” said immigration attorney Jodi Goodwin, who is based in Harlingen, Texas. She added: “I think the reality is that [Title 42] did nothing to help public health. There was still international movement into the US. I think it was a very thinly – veiled cover for racism, specifically targeted at Central Americans and Haitians.” Goodwin said she had recently spoken to one of her clients at a camp in the border city of Matamoros who informed her that her young daughter had recently been sexually assaulted there. “Where’s the justice? It’s not going to happen. And there are just … a lot of cases like that.” But the humanitarian consequences of Title 42 and policies such as Remain in Mexico, which Biden initially lifted but was reinstated by court order, along with the nuances around projected increases in crossings, appear to have already been lost in partisan rhetoric. As soon as the decision on Title 42 was announced on Friday, Republicans condemned the move, as the party gears up to force the issue as a wedge throughout the midterm election season. The Texas senator Ted Cruz argued the decision would “open the flood gates to more illegal crossings”. Florida Republican senator Rick Scott described it as an “unconscionable plan”. Centrist Democrats too, had begun publicly urging the president not to revoke the directive. On Friday, the West Virginia senator Joe Manchin described the announcement as a “frightening decision”. He described the Trump-era policy as “an essential tool in combatting the spread of Covid-19 and controlling the influx of migrants at our southern border”. Those on the ground, too, say there is, as yet, no clear guidance for how exactly the processing of asylum claims might change when the order is lifted. Last week, the Biden administration finalized plans to streamline the asylum application process, meaning applicants could have their claims of credible fear of returning to their countries of origin assessed by customs and border officials rather than immigration judges, due to chronic and growing backlogs in the immigration courts. But a continued rise in border arrivals will require greater humanitarian assistance in the region too. “Humanitarian, on-the-ground NGOs have been preparing for this for two years,” said Karla Vargas, a senior attorney with the Texas Civil Rights project, “but whenever DHS talks about preparation [for a rise in border arrivals] there tends to be a focus on enforcement only. But there really does need to be more focus on the processing of these individuals. “Most of the folks who are waiting that we have spoken to are just regular people, wanting to ask for asylum. To access that right.”",News/US news,Unpicking of Trump-era asylum curbs primes partisan powder keg,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/03/us-asylum-policy-immigration-border-biden
4/3/2022,"First performed in 1893, Utopia, Limited was Gilbert and Sullivan’s penultimate opera. Less immediately successful than its predecessors, it divided opinion in its day, and remains an unknown quantity for many. Depicting an imaginary island so obsessed with British values that, under (specifically) English influence, it sets itself up, monarchy and all, as a limited company under the 1862 Companies Act, it satirises the privatisation of public institutions, as well as sideswiping at both the “parliamentary peculiarities” of party politics and a press fixated on royal scandal. Dramatically it meanders a bit, and the colonialist assumptions that underpin it now render some of it suspect. It also, however, contains some of Sullivan’s loveliest music, and Scottish Opera have taken it into their repertory, albeit with some pruning, as a companion piece to their production of The Gondoliers, first seen in Glasgow and Edinburgh last year, and now on tour in London. Directed by Stuart Maunder and conducted by Derek Clark, it’s billed as a semi-staging, though it’s considerably more than that. Using the Act Two Gondoliers set, it’s effectively a full modern-dress production in which the suits and cocktail frocks worn at the start are gradually replaced by posh tail coats and ball gowns as Anglicisation takes over. Well aware that you don’t need to send up something that is already a send-up, Maunder plays it relatively straight, and it’s beautifully acted and sung by a classy ensemble cast. Ben McAteer makes a fine King Paramount, well-meaning, dithering and longing to be free of his two pushy advisers, Scaphio and Phantis, a classy double act from Richard Suart and Arthur Bruce. Charlie Drummond is the Girton-educated Princess Zara, in love with William Morgan’s uptight Captain Fitzbattleaxe of the First Life Guards: they sound good together in Words of Love Too Loudly Spoken, the most exquisite love duet in Sullivan’s output. Yvonne Howard, meanwhile, is outstanding and extraordinarily sympathetic as the principled Lady Sophy, in love with Paramount, but alarmed and saddened by newspaper gossip about his private life.

4/3/2022,"We all know that our small business owners are the lifeblood of the US economy. There are approximately 30 million of us and we provide more than half of the jobs in this country. Everyone seems to love us. Politicians court us. Big brands tip their hats to us. Each year we celebrate our small business community with Small Business Week, Small Business Saturday, National Entrepreneurship Month and many other days honoring independent workers and minority business owners. Yay for us! But you know what? As much as I’m an advocate and a voice for my fellow small business brethren, even I have to admit that not all small business owners are worthy of such praise. Some, in fact, are not worthy at all. There are the restaurant owners – like these in California, Michigan and Oregon to name just a few – who blatantly and recklessly defied local Covid regulations and put their customers and employees at risk of dying from something other than the E coli in their food. Or the dentist in Wisconsin who broke his patients’ teeth in order to submit false insurance claims (wow!). And let’s not forget the seemingly incalculable number of small business owners – like the operators of a tech company and a baking business in Massachusetts, the genius who ran a real estate firm in Pennsylvania, the serial fraudster from Delaware and the twin brothers who oversaw multiple businesses in California – who all defrauded the federal government by submitting fake claims for Covid relief funds because, hey, why should that money go to people who actually needed it, right? Or how about the manufacturer in Georgia who was ordered to pay $250,000 after firing a disabled employee? Who does that? Or the regional water services company in Minnesota that was told to cough up $45,000 to an employee who was unfairly terminated due to the color of her skin? Who does that too? Turns out a lot of business owners do that. And other bad things too. If you don’t believe me then check out the tallies the government keeps. For example, less than a month ago the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission released detailed breakdowns of more than 67,448 charges of workplace discrimination claims the agency received in just its past fiscal year. The agency said it secured $439.2m for the victims of discrimination in the private sector and state and local government workplaces through voluntary resolutions and litigation. The Department of Labor recently reported thousands of cases from 2021 where businesses in industries ranging from auto repairs to landscaping services underpaid or mistreated employees. And it’s not just employees getting defrauded. For example, there are the independent entrepreneurs that make their money being social media influencers but who then dupe unwitting people into giving them free stuff in return for fake promises of a mention. Or the fraudulent freelancers operating on well-known online platforms that take money in return for doing no work at all. Or the independent contractors – like this one in Philadelphia – who allegedly collected payments for jobs such as bathroom renovations and home reconstruction in return for … spoiler alert: not doing the work. The Federal Trade Commission this year received more than 2.8m reports of consumer fraud against businesses ranging from deceptive credit repair services to those monsters that are robo-calling my mobile phone in the middle of the night. So what have I learned from all this research? It’s that even though it rankles me when people accuse small businesses of seeking profits over their employees’ welfare, or paying too little, or acting offensively or defrauding their customers, I have to admit that in some cases ... these people may have a point. It’s sad. But I can’t deny it. Of course, the vast majority of small business owners are good people who run good businesses and who care about their employees. But there are still more than just a few that, frankly, are not. So now when someone does accuse a business owner of doing something unseemly my kneejerk reaction isn’t to automatically dispute that person’s claim.

4/3/2022,"If you hadn’t heard of Coleg Harlech in Wales, an adult education college whose endangered brutalist structures are “probably the most sheerly convincing 20th-century buildings in the entire country”, don’t worry. You are not alone. And it is precisely because works like this are obscure that Modern Buildings in Britain had to be written. For one of its strengths is the devotion and persistence with which Owen Hatherley has sought out gems across the country: a radar station in Fleetwood, an experimental plastic classroom in Preston, the magical Pannier Market in Plymouth, the modest 1950s Edgbaston offices of the Engineering & Allied Employers’ Federation. These take their place alongside more famous works – the National Theatre and the Lloyd’s building in London, the Scottish parliament in Edinburgh – in a century-plus sweep that goes back to Charles Rennie Mackintosh’s Glasgow School of Art, built from 1897 to 1909, and extends to recent designs by 6a Architects, Amin Taha and Assemble. What emerges from this 600-page breeze block of book is a sense of colossal achievement, by the many architects and builders who made such a diverse, inventive and powerful array of buildings. It demonstrates that modern architecture in Britain, often controversial and demonised, is a substantial, irremovable and remarkable part of the national story. A baggy definition of “modern” is required. It’s easier to say what’s out – the reheated classicism of Quinlan Terry, almost everything by the late-imperial maestro Edwin Lutyens – than what should be in. The common factor to the included designs, if there is one, is a sense that modern times create conditions and freedoms that engender buildings different from those of the past. If that’s broad, it’s also generous, taking in Kate Macintosh’s majestic housing for the London borough of Southwark and the “expressionist emotion and kitsch decoration” of Francis Xavier Velarde’s 1936 church of St Monica in Bootle. Hatherley is informed and insightful but also frankly opinionated, with possibly unexpected results. He has a taste for astringent functionality, but also for the colourful postmodern extravagances of FAT’s studios for the BBC in Cardiff and John Outram’s “muscular and cartoonish” Judge Business School in Cambridge. What attracts him most is evidence of strong minds, of architects who know what they want and go for it. Most strong-minded of all is brutalism – “responsible,” says Hatherley, “for most of the genuine masterpieces of 20th-century architecture in Britain” – the love of which is a driving force behind the book. Some contradictions are inherent to Hatherley’s project. He says that he wants to describe buildings as lived-in experiences rather than “pure image”, but the format of the gazetteer doesn’t allow him to linger long in any one place. It presents architecture as an array of individual objects, indeed as images, rather than as inhabited places. The ancestry of the genre goes back via the Buildings of England guidebooks of Nikolaus Pevsner to the grand tours of 18th-century English aristocrats. It implies an eye that is detached, touristic, educated, potentially entitled. This approach generates switchbacks from subjective to objective and back again – between adjectival descriptions (“rigorous”, “ruthless”, “thrilling”, “socially convincing and visually enjoyable”) and scholarly identifications of Scandinavian or constructivist influences. It leads him to categorise each building with a style (“moderne”, “modernist eclectic”, “ecomodernism”) that helps to navigate the multiplicity of looks, but puts projects in boxes where they don’t comfortably belong. Hatherley also struggles to reconcile his love of modernist architecture with a commitment to socialist politics. Both, as he says, are progressive, but not in ways that are perfectly aligned with each other. Thus Richard Seifert, an enthusiastic agent of property developers’ capitalism such as the Centre Point tower in London, designed modernist buildings that Hatherley admires. Leftwing local authorities, as he acknowledges, have been known to commission unprogressive neo-Georgian. He’s not wrong, though, to point out that politics and architecture are intertwined, and it’s better to lay out the unresolved questions than ignore them, which is the usual practice of guidebooks and gazetteers. It would be perverse to chronicle modernist architecture in Britain without mentioning, for example, its significance to the schools and council housing of Clement Attlee’s postwar government. And, in truth, all of us who write about architecture have to find our fallible way through this always vague terrain, where form and content and look and meaning invert and blur. Hatherley, with this phenomenal work of gathering and observation, does it better than most.  Modern Buildings in Britain: A Gazetteer by Owen Hatherley is published by Particular Books (£60).

4/3/2022,"No sweltering on the porch, no scuppernongs, no pickled pigs knuckles. Above all, no real sense of the simultaneous strangeness and closeness of other people. Director Bartlett Sher’s production of Harper Lee’s enthralling novel To Kill a Mockingbird arrives on gusts of Broadway success and tides of right thinking. It has a strong central performance by Rafe Spall, full of modest conviction as the white lawyer Atticus Finch, and a blazing one from Patrick O’Kane as a Klan-leaning bully. Nevertheless, this is a thin, often awkward evening. More of an argument than an experience. Aaron Sorkin’s “new play” puts the courtroom drama, in which Finch defends a black workman against a trumped-up charge of rape, centre stage from the outset. It is the framework of the entire evening rather than the culmination of exclusions and longstanding tribalism. For the first time ever, a design by the great Miriam Buether kept me apart from the action rather than plunging me into it: courtroom, homestead and jail are by turns perched in a bleak grey warehouse. The sense of an inbred township in which families can identify traits down generations – “every third Merriweather is morbid” – is missing, visually and verbally. In Lee’s novel, fragrance and fury make a poisonous mixture: ladylike white women fanning their prejudices as they sip their tea are the dainty version of the men who gather together in hoods ready to lynch. The sense of group pressure would add dramatic force: the stage is often underpopulated, not least in the court scene (compare the milling crowds of the Gregory Peck film!) where spectators don’t lean expectantly into the action but are corralled into a small space like quizzical budgerigars. Also missing is the novel’s luxuriant idiosyncrasy. The history of the outsider Boo Radley, feared and persecuted by the children, is absent until the closing scenes when, in a sudden gabble of plot summaries, he pops up behind a door (Boo!). Lee’s novel creates a landscape in which everyone whose life is not known is suspected. Sorkin’s play is about a straightforward clash. The N-word is used more than once, but some aspects of the novel have been adjusted. The black housekeeper Calpurnia – more or less silent in Lee’s account – forcefully, and not altogether plausibly, tackles Finch for expecting her to be grateful, while Finch is seen as less wholly heroic, not least because he expects gratitude. Still, Calpurnia does not have the inner heft of the white kids (one modelled on Lee’s childhood friend Truman Capote) who boss the plot around, telling the audience what is going on. They do so often while capering – looking far too clean and spookily old. They instruct us rather than, as the novel does and what all great theatre should, allow us to stand in another’s shoes. I hope that the West End audiences now on their feet for To Kill a Mockingbird may soon be doing the same for The Mozart Question. What a radiant production Jessica Daniels has made of Michael Morpurgo’s short story. I have been struggling to get to Cirencester’s Barn since it opened in 2018; it is now high on my list of theatres around which to build a day out. The former Nissen hut on the edge of a golden town, with room for 200 under its wooden rafters, is not only recharging established plays, but creating new work. As here. This is the important story of Jewish musicians forced by Nazis to play their instruments in the concentration camps, often as a terrible sanitising welcome to new arrivals off the trains. It is a vital memorial, which also floats the question of whether art is contaminated by circumstances. Vicki Berwick’s adaptation could do with some tucks; it sometimes lumbers into flatness (“you lost our music… don’t lose our son”) in a production that marvellously shows words are not the only way of steering a theatrical plot in the theatre. Eight of the nine performers are musicians: a tight, all-string ensemble who plait their dialogue with notes from Rossini, klezmer and Vivaldi, as well as Wolfgang. A duet for violins, one slowly entwining the other, is heard as two characters fall in love. An adolescent finds a unique voice when picking up the violin, moving from teenage scraping to silvery sound. As prisoners dream of a life outside the camp they hear – unreachable but nevertheless present – harmony ringing around them. A traditional Venice – street lamps, marionettes and warm summer nights – is conjured by Ceci Calf’s beautifully spare design in which a crumbling brick wall is covered with small pages of sheet music. Sam Rowcliffe-Tanner’s magnificent lighting carves a warm space for a friendly barber’s shop (in a nice touch the musician who has put down his violin in favour of shears is praised for the rhythm with which he cuts hair). Then the colour drains away. The camps, reached in a gush of smoke as if from a train, are evoked by the lack of light and by stillness. Standing together as if clamped by an iron fist, at one painful moment musicians distort their bodies, lifting cellos as well as violins into the air: the instruments seem to have their own life. Clybourne Park was a knockout when it opened at the Royal Court 12 years ago. Bruce Norris’s play is a response to Lorraine Hansberry’s mighty 1959 exploration of racism and money in America, A Raisin in the Sun: its skill is to disguise satire as drawing-room comedy, teasing the audience with uneasy jokes, and to use the resources of the theatre to pivot their preconceptions. The first half shows a comfy, middle-class white neighbourhood – standard lamps, the National Geographic, a woman in a starched skirt fussing around with iced drinks – startled by the arrival of a black family (can they ski?); the second shows the same neighbourhood a generation on, when most of the property owners are black and the incoming threat is from a white couple who want to raze the area’s history by demolition. “The history of America is the history of private property,” one character declares; James Turner’s neat, economical design highlights the argument by beginning and ending with a grand doll’s house lit up in the centre of the stage. This still feels shrewd, and sometimes penetrating, but the bite of its newness has weakened: the second half tapers off; it is needling rather than threatening. Still, director Oliver Kaderbhai’s very bright, crisp production makes a good case for its revival. There is a terrific performance from Katie Matsell, doubling as a profoundly deaf, patronised wife and a gormless, gabby liberal. Oh, and the best tampon joke since poor Charles and Camilla’s moment. Why are tampons like white women? Answers on a non-PC PC.

4/3/2022,"Scientists are perfecting a new anti-cancer treatment that exploits the body’s own cellular waste disposal system. Some drugs are already producing promising results, and the number of new medicines is expected to rise in the near future with the opening of a British centre dedicated to using the technique. Fifteen researchers will work at the Centre for Protein Degradation which has been set up through a £9m donation to the Institute of Cancer Research, in London, by philanthropists David and Ruth Hill. Many modern cancer drugs work by blocking the function of harmful proteins, said Professor Ian Collins, head of the new centre. However, this technique is different, he added. It wipes them out completely. “Our cells have evolved a highly efficient technique for removing harmful proteins. It’s part of the everyday business of life. However, our cells’ protein degradation processes only recognise a specific number of proteins. “Science has now found a way to add to that number – to put flags on to new proteins that the cell wouldn’t otherwise touch but which we now realise are harmful and involved in tumour development. “We are saying to our cells: please can you add this harmful protein to the trash that you are taking out?” An early example of this approach is provided by the protein degradation drug lenalidomide, which is used to treat the blood cancer myeloma, and which has been shown to improve patients’ quality of life. “I’d never even heard the word myeloma,” said Cecelia Brunott, 45, from Farnham in Surrey, who was diagnosed in 2020. “Today it is working to keep my condition stable and keep my myeloma in check for longer.” Collins said drugs like lenalidomide could pinpoint a molecule that would otherwise continue to carry out its function in promoting cancer. “Essentially, it makes it visible to the cell’s waste disposal machinery. It flags it up for disposal and ensures it is shredded and destroyed.” A similar type of drug has also been found to target breast cancer. Known as a selective oestrogen receptor degrader, it degrades a protein that is an important driver of breast cancer. “At present, much effort is concentrating on using protein degradation to develop new cancer drugs,” added Collins. “However, we hope that in future this technique will be used to develop medicines for tackling other types of disease. It has powerful potential and promise.”",News/Science,New cancer treatment uses body’s cellular waste disposal to flag harmful proteins,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/03/new-cancer-treatment-uses-bodys-cellular-waste-disposal-to-flag-harmful-proteins
