4/25/2022,"Replacing Australia’s largest coal-fired power station with renewable energy would create tens of thousands more construction jobs than replacing it with gas, a new analysis has found. The Eraring coal-fired power station in the Lake Macquarie region of New South Wales is scheduled to close in 2025. A new report by the Australian Conservation Foundation estimates if the electricity output of the station was replaced entirely with rooftop solar it would create 63,562 construction jobs. The same amount replaced by solar farms would create 14,415 jobs and windfarms 13,339 jobs. New fossil fuel generation lagged behind clean options, with gas creating the lowest number of construction jobs at 1,566. New coal-fired power plants would create an estimated 8,576 jobs. The tool for calculating the number of construction jobs was built by energy market analyst Tristan Edis, who developed it by using historical jobs data for recent energy projects. “Renewable energy is the winning option for communities that have for decades relied on coal-fired power stations which are now on their last legs,” the ACF’s chief executive Kelly O’Shanassy said. She said residents of the Hunter Valley in NSW, the Latrobe Valley in Victoria and Gladstone in Queensland had for many years depended on jobs linked to coalmines and power stations. “Replacing old coal fired generators with renewables will bring a jobs boom to those regions,” she said. The analysis also looks at household comparisons and finds 26,484 construction jobs could be created if Australia chose to install rooftop solar on one million new homes. Solar farms would create 6,006 construction jobs, wind 5,558 jobs, while new coal would create 3,573 and gas just 652. Tim Buckley, the director of Climate Energy Finance, said the difference in employment potential that the analysis found between rooftop solar and gas did not surprise him. “The level of employment in the rooftop solar sector is huge and Australia’s solar industry is predominantly rooftop and it’s a highly skilled area,” he said. Buckley said the politicisation of decarbonisation meant two aspects of the energy transition had often been ignored. “One, it ignores the inevitability of the transition, and two, the massive investment, employment and export opportunities that are ahead of Australia,” he said. The release of the report comes amid the federal election campaign, in which the major parties have promised to back fossil fuels. In the first 10 days of campaigning, the Coalition announced or confirmed more than $800m in funding for fossil fuel developments. The largest portion of that has come from an agreement with the Northern Territory’s Labor government around gas development in the Beetaloo Basin. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has also pledged $130m for carbon capture and storage by gas companies in the territory. In Queensland, Anthony Albanese said proposals for new mega coalmines would be assessed according to national environmental law and if they cleared that process they could go ahead. The Labor leader has said the financial viability of such projects was a matter for the companies proposing them.",News/Australia news,"Replacing NSW coal plant with renewables would create thousands more jobs than gas, report says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/25/replacing-nsw-coal-plant-with-renewables-would-create-thousands-more-jobs-than-gas-report-says
4/25/2022,"Ihad been supposed to file two more columns in this series in advance, before taking some leave, but five week ago my waters broke in spectacular fashion – the way they do in films, the way the NCT woman said you really didn’t want them to break. “It’s too early,” I kept saying, again like some cinema cliche. During the rush to the hospital, our Uber got stuck behind a hearse travelling at a suitably funereal pace. The catastrophist in me assumed an omen. The writer in me rolled her eyes and thought: nice touch. And so the boy, the bairn, is here (bairn is not a word I ever used before, but for some reason I cannot stop, as though my northern ancestors have risen up in me, conjured by all the drama). I am still adjusting to the fact that he is no longer inside me, that I thought I had five more weeks of kicks and punches, how I never got to see the reverse imprint of his hand on my skin. Anxieties about Covid notwithstanding, I loved being pregnant with him, and we’ve been catapulted into the fourth trimester without quite being done with the third. He is here and hardly anything is ready, and despite needing some help from some magnificent doctors, he is all right, and my life is transformed.My colleague Eva Wiseman was right about the love feeling two centimetres from grief. I have been skinned alive. I weep at the merest trifle, as if I’m the baby. On the night we came home from hospital, I cried and cried. I want a bumper between my new family and the world. I could have done without Billy Bragg’s Tank Park Salute coming on the radio in the kitchen: another microwave meal salted with tears.The love feels like terror too: of all the ways in which he could be taken from me (it’s the women who are blasé whom we worry about, said the discharging midwife).But most of all, it feels like gratitude. For him: my dream come true. For his father. For the medical care, the costs of which in another place would have run, possibly, into the millions. For our safety. The day after I had him, the Russians bombed a Ukrainian maternity hospital. Before my son’s arrival, I had been reading of the women giving birth underground. “Don’t look at the news,” a friend texted, as I lay in a bay without my baby, who had been rushed to neonatal intensive care, listening to the sounds of labouring women, and she was right. I could not bear it.How to articulate the transfiguration from not-mother to mother? I am the same person, and yet everything I wrote before feels naive and misinformed. It is as though I have been made party to some great secret. As though, when I stepped out of that taxi and into the old looming Victorian building, with its ghost sign saying “women’s receiving ward”, just as my own mother and thousands of other women had before me, I was initiated.That could, of course, be the drugs.I didn’t have a birth plan. I was due to have a scan, to meet the obstetrician to discuss the best way forward. The hypnobirthing book I bought second-hand in an attempt to calm my fears regarding childbirth was clear in its views of the sort of delivery I should have. I am not so impressionable, and when I skipped forward to read about the aftermath, the page proclaiming: “You’ve birthed a baby and you’re a goddamn goddess” in a register I have come to dislike was decorated with – I kid you not – a smear of what looked like blood. Disgusting, but you could say it was the most honest thing in the entire book. There was, indeed, blood.During my week in the hospital, I kept seeing glimpses through windows of the most beautiful spring skies, promising a world outside for the both of us, if he would only breathe and feed on his own. After a few days I realised that I was not a prisoner, I could go out for a walk. In the lift I joked with a man about a discarded hat and how gross it would be if one of us put it on, and I was grateful that I could still hold a conversation that was not about my baby.At the same time, he is everything, just as I am to him. My boy who could not wait, but whose eyes are scarcely open. Love, in the words of Sylvia Plath, set him going like a “fat gold watch”, but it has taken far more treatment than a “slap on the soles” from a midwife to give him a healthy start in life. In the small hours, in the bluish darkness of the ward, I sat next to his incubator and tried to remember lullabies, but amid the fear and the love and the painkiller fog the words had all vanished. Instead, as the machines beeped reassuringly and I stroked his skin through the small porthole, no longer able to be the ship that carried him, he got Here Comes the Sun.What’s working: My husband has been reading a book called Don’t Panic! All the Stuff The Expectant Dad Needs to Know, by George Lewis. Unlike most parenting books, it features contributions from comedians including Elis James, Romesh Ranganathan and Josh Widdecombe, and it is very funny – not that he got to finish it in time. What isn’t: Without wanting to sound like the observational standup bits in Seinfeld, the rumours about hospital food are indeed, true. I was overjoyed, however, to discover the south Asian menu on the reverse of the page. Nevertheless, even microwave daal gets old eventually.

4/25/2022,"During the four minutes and 39 seconds that passed between the ball hitting the back of the net for Arsenal’s disallowed second “goal” against Manchester United on Saturday, the subsequent VAR check and Bukayo Saka wheeling away in celebration after scoring the consolation spot-kick awarded in its place, there was plenty of confusion. On the pitch, in the stands, in households around the country and even in the BT Sport commentary box – nobody except the referee, Craig Pawson, and his assistants seemed quite sure what exactly was going on. The big screen informed fans a possible offside was being checked and Eddie Nketiah was duly and correctly adjudged to have been guilty: no goal. Afterwards, another check was made on a potential foul on Saka by Alex Telles in the build-up to the disallowed effort. Pawson adjourned to his pitch-side monitor and perhaps under pressure from a crowd whipped into a frenzy by a furiously gesticulating Mikel Arteta, awarded Arsenal a penalty which was duly dispatched by Saka. Whether or not the penalty should have been given remains unclear and far from obvious, but the fact that so few paying punters at the Emirates Stadium knew exactly what was happening for the length of time it takes to boil an egg or run the kind of mile Sir Roger Bannister would be ashamed of seems more than a little strange. It was by no means the first time a paying crowd in a Premier League football stadium or those watching at home have been left shrouded in uncertainty during a VAR check and it almost certainly won’t be the last. However, it could be, if like in NFL, for example, the match officials tasked with making these big calls were able to explain to the folks watching in the ground and at home what it is exactly that is being checked and why. We have the technology; in the US, football referees have been using it to provide increased transparency and credibility to on-field rulings for just shy of 50 years. We have mic’d up referees before, albeit not for the reasons outlined above. Last week on Sky Sports, Inside The WSL was devoted to an interview with the extremely engaging head of refereeing in the Women’s Super League, Bibiana Steinhaus-Webb and featured a segment in which Emily Heaslip’s every word could be heard by viewers as she officiated a top‑flight match between Chelsea and Reading. While the crowd at Kingsmeadow could not hear the rationale behind Heaslip’s decisions in a one-sided match that was unfortunately low on contentiousness, the experiment did provide a fascinating and educational insight into the reasoning behind the big calls she made both on her own and in collaboration with her assistants running the lines. “So much information is shared within the team which are crucial for making the right decisions,” said Steinhaus-Webb, a former Fifa-listed referee and the first woman to take charge of games in the Bundesliga. “Thank you so much actually for doing that with us, to communicate to a wider audience and really let people know what is going on on the field of play.” Of course at this point it behoves us to hark back to the first occasion an English referee was mic’d up as part of a similar wheeze, when David Elleray took on the role of guinea pig for ITV’s World In Action during a match between Millwall and Arsenal at the Den in 1989. Legend has it that while both clubs were informed of the experiment, nobody at Highbury saw fit to tell Arsenal’s players. The upshot? Millwall’s players were uncharacteristically polite to the point of saintliness in their dealings with Harrow’s most famous housemaster, while those of Arsenal effed and jeffed their way through the game with foul-mouthed abandon, with skipper Tony Adams at one point being heard to scream in no uncertain terms that Elleray was “a fuckin’ cheat”. Far more recently, a clip of an A-League match refereed by a mic’d up Jarred Gillett earned the Australian match official no end of viewer plaudits for the calm efficiency with which he went about his business. It was his final game Down Under before his move to England, where he now referees in the Premier League and like all his colleagues, is routinely abused by fans who often have only a very vague understanding of many of the laws of the game and the thinking behind their enforcement. “There’s a bit more of an appreciation that we can quickly explain things, offer an interpretation to the players that most times they’ll accept if you can explain it in quick, simple terms,” Gillett said of his experience of broadcasting to a TV audience. “I can see at some point in time that the comms, certainly between the referees and VARs, that some elements of the decision-making process will be broadcast.” Now seems as good a time as any, almost three full seasons after the introduction of video assistant referees who regularly add to confusion surrounding the kind of decisions they were brought in to clear up. While there is no need for matchday crowds and TV viewers to hear every word spoken by referees during games, match officials might welcome the opportunity to keep them informed of what exactly is happening during lengthy pauses for VAR checks and provide concise, informative explanations of whatever decisions are ultimately made. While officials will still make mistakes, those affected by them would at least get to see that most if not all refereeing errors are ultimately made in good faith. Players, managers, pundits and fans have long called for referees to come before the cameras after games to explain their more perplexing decisions. The sport of football might be better served if we all got to hear them do so while those on-field judgments are being made.",Sport/Football,To be seen and not heard is keeping supporters and viewers in the dark | Barry Glendenning,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/25/to-be-seen-and-not-heard-is-keeping-supporters-and-viewers-in-the-dark
4/25/2022,"There is a reason Everton are third-bottom in the league: they’ve been the league’s third-worst team. With just six games remaining, they are in serious danger of breaking the English game’s second-longest run of top-flight football – only Arsenal have stuck it out longer than their 78 years. Despite a difficult run-in, Frank Lampard can take heart from how his team played at Anfield: organised and doughty in defence, enterprising and swift in attack – a spirit encapsulated by a contretemps towards the end of the first half when, after Abdoulaye Doucouré fouled Fabinho to get play stopped so Richarlison could receive treatment, almost the entire team piled into the kerfuffle, including Jordan Pickford, the goalkeeper. Obviously there is more to football than aggression and if , over the course of the season, Everton had shown as much as they didon Sunday, they’d not be in the mess they are. But similarly, if they can maintain it, they might yet save themselves. Daniel Harris Match report: Liverpool 2-0 Everton As Tottenham stiffed at Brentford, fortunate to come away with a draw in the eyes of Thomas Frank, there was a sense that they had been found out. Like Brighton’s Graham Potter, Frank set traps to stifle Spurs’s midfield and asked repeated questions of defenders uncertain at set pieces. Christian Eriksen meanwhile embodied the idea that the best players can always find time on the ball, though no such luxury was allowed to Harry Kane and Son Heung-min, his former attacking accomplices. High energy and muscle appear to cause sincere problems for Spurs, who are unable to emulate the accelerated tempo of Antonio Conte’s most effective teams. “We have to try to increase and go 150% to try to reach this target,” said the Italian, reminding reporters of the team he inherited in November: eighth in the table and shipping goals. He has certainly revived Tottenham since – only for opponents to perhaps work out how he did so. John Brewin Match report: Brentford 0-0 Tottenham John Stones, Kyle Walker and Nathan Aké are all injury doubts for Manchester City ahead of Tuesday’s visit of Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-final first leg. But with a maximum of eight matches left this season Pep Guardiola is not concerned he may struggle to field enough senior players in the campaign’s defining phase. “If it was November or December, it’s a problem but if Gabriel [Jesus] has to play right-back, he’d play right-back. So it’s not a problem, when the players feel we are in real trouble, the players do extra. You saw from minute one how they want to win games, the next one and next one. When this happens, we know we can trust each other. Less than one month until the end of the season and we are going to do it.” Jamie Jackson Match report: Manchester City 5-1 Watford Steven Gerrard expects Philippe Coutinho, quiet in recent games, to rediscover his creative best in Aston Villa’s forthcoming games against Norwich and Burnley. The Brazil playmaker, on a six-month loan from Barcelona with an option to buy for £33m, has been involved in only one goal in seven away games and spent much of Saturday’s goalless draw at Leicester diligently tracking opponents, never his strength. “Phil will be fine,” the Villa manager said. “We can’t expect Phil to be man of the match, creator and goalscorer every time he plays. I don’t have to stand here and defend Philippe Coutinho; he defends himself with the level that he’s at. We’re playing against two teams now, with all due respect, that we should be able to create chances and have good territorial opportunities.” Peter Lansley Match report: Leicester 0-0 Aston Villa Factor in a missed penalty, various squandered chances and couple of borderline VAR decisions, and it’s fair to say that Arsenal’s seesawing win was not a result from which to draw big conclusions. Yet the outcome nonetheless felt like a fitting one: a club with a clear sense of direction triumphing over one with none. And Arsenal’s recent rejuvenation could hold some lessons for anyone at Old Trafford willing to learn them. Since his appointment, Mikel Arteta has ridded the club of high-earning, high-profile albatrosses – Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Mesut Özil, Willian, David Luiz and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang all shown the door – and rebuilt the side around a core of young, hungry, un-starry players. There is no shortage of celebrity deadwood at Old Trafford of course, but there’s plenty of youthful quality too. Jadon Sancho, for instance, will have been watching the electric Bukayo Saka on Saturday with rightful envy. Oh, to be at a club with a semblance of good sense. Alex Hess  Match report: Arsenal 3-1 Manchester United “He’s Brazilian, he only cost £40 million … and we think he’s effing brilliant” rang out from the Carrow Road away end long after Saturday’s final whistle. Joelinton, who marked his 100th Premier League appearance with a first-half brace, walked away slowly, not wanting to break their gaze. From laughing stock to cult hero – and much of it due to two games against Norwich. In the reverse fixture, Ciaran Clark’s brainless dismissal forced Eddie Howe to move Joelinton into a deeper role. He has barely skipped a samba beat there since. But with Chris Wood owed a rest, the Brazilian made a rare start across a fluid front three. He finished with the confidence of a man enjoying life. As well he might. Sam Dalling Match report: Norwich 0-3 Newcastle It’s been a miserable few weeks for Southampton, their past eight games consisting of six defeats, one draw and one win. Their supporters will have feared the worst when Mohammed Salisu’s own-goal a minute before the break left them 2-0 down. Enter James Ward-Prowse, who, though he’s originally from Portsmouth, has come to symbolise all that’s good about his club. Although it seems like he has been around a lifetime, at 27 he still has plenty of room for improvement. So when his team were given a free-kick deep in first-half injury-time, it was inevitable that Ward-Prowse would take it and felt almost inevitable that he’d score, which he did – via a clever, low, whipped effort that was too good for Robert Sánchez. Then, just nine minutes after the restart, he drove a superb low equaliser into the corner to save Southampton yet again. Daniel Harris Match report: Brighton 2-2 Southampton Gary Player famously quipped that the more he practised, the luckier he got, and similar can be said of Liverpool. They work terrifyingly hard and compete with ferocious intensity which, allied to the extent of their ability, allows them to willpower their way to all the goals and wins we’ve seen over the past few years – with Jürgen Klopp’s formidable football brain also playing its part. But his team are not infallible. Though it would be easy to say – as Graeme Souness did – that Everton simply sat back and hoped, there was more to it than that. Because Liverpool rely on their full-backs to make the play, they necessarily leave space behind them which Anthony Gordon exploited time and again. Ultimately – and like most teams in the world – Everton weren’t able to make anything of it, but we can be sure that the joy they found won’t have escaped the attention of Unai Emery, whose Villarreal team visit Anfield on Wednesday. Daniel Harris A red-carded defender as man of the match? Well, yes. Craig Dawson was excellent, a one-man central defensive wall flanked by a pair of full-backs in a makeshift back three. Block after block, he kept Chelsea at bay – until his late red card. Still, not bad for a man who started his working life as a glass collector at the Dog and Partridge pub in Rochdale before eventually signing for his home town club in League Two. He arrived on loan at West Ham in 2020 after Watford’s relegation and since that move was made permanent last summer he has flourished. Injuries to Angelo Ogbonna, Kurt Zouma and most recently Issa Diop meant his appearance on Sunday was his 45th of the campaign, his most since 2010-11. A suspected broken nose obtained in Lyon could not keep Dawson sidelined, but his dismissal will – though if anyone has earned a rest, it’s him. Sam Dalling Match report: Chelsea 1-0 West Ham There has been a change in Burnley’s results since Sean Dyche’s surprise dismissal but plenty of the hallmarks of the style that made his stint at Turf Moor so successful are still present. How that was evident on Sunday as Mike Jackson’s side scrapped and battled their way to a potentially priceless 1-0 win against Wolves, moving out of the relegation zone for the first time since October. The one thing that is different about Burnley is the momentum they now possess, and it could be crucial. Hope may now be turning into expectation that Jackson can pull off the greatest of escapes. Win at Watford next – and with Everton and Leeds United facing far tougher run-ins than Burnley – what seemed improbable when Dyche was relieved of his duties could become a distinct possibility as Jackson’s side continue to ride on the crest of this surprise wave.

4/25/2022,"Once a vibrant and noisy place, the market at Waheen was Somaliland’s largest. It had about 2,000 shops and stalls, selling fresh fruit and meat alongside tailors’ and tech support stores. When fire raged through the city of Hargeisa earlier this month, at least 28 people were injured and hundreds of businesses were destroyed. It was “a massive calamity” for the city’s economic centre, says Hargeisa’s mayor, Abdikarim Ahmed Mooge. With much of Waheen in ruins, many of those who worked there have been left devastated. Most are women. Amina Ali, a meat seller at Waheen, says that although the flames have gone out, the damage continues: “Today, our situation is at its worst. Waheen is at the heart of everything in Hargeisa and now it’s all gone to waste. Nobody is coming to help us. We don’t have anyone, we only have God.” Ali says the fire has affected her whole community – family and neighbours – and the scale of damage is difficult to measure. Ayaan Salaad Mohamed, who had a beauty services business, says smaller businesses like hers are not a priority. The federal government promised money but despite asking for assistance, Mohamed says not much is being done. “Nobody knows how this has impacted us. We weren’t rich people, but we would make enough money to get through our daily affairs. Our life has taken a drastic turn, but we will work with whatever God provides,” she says. Mohamed has seven people financially dependent on her, including her widowed mother, and says she is now trying to sell fruit to make ends meet. People haven’t been able to return to the market to search for any goods that survived the flames. “The night before the fire, we left with our baskets filled to the top. Today, we are standing around aimlessly,” says Khadra Mohamed Dahir. “People are only thinking about those who had big businesses that burned down, but what about those of us who ran smaller businesses?” Shukri Abdi sold meat in the market. All her books of receipts and customer orders were burned, making it difficult to find her regular customers and to call in money she is owed. Like others, Abdi has moved to sell under a bridge in Hargeisa.“Before, we sat comfortably selling our goods and now we are outside in the sun, with no shade. We are sitting in between the rubbish and our feet are swollen from standing up all day.” Yurub Omar has also moved under the bridge. She used to sell bananas and now sells salt and ground coffee. Nimco Husein Abdi owned a business and sold bedding, clothes and more. Her customers paid in instalments. “All my things are gone. I still haven’t paid my rent but if me and my children are alive, we have to thank God. I’m just sat at home most of the time because there is nothing for me to sell. But today, I came out to see if I could find some food for my children from my friends.” Halima Abdirahman Nur considers herself one of the lucky ones. “My mother and I owned a small store and we’ve been working since 1991,” she says. “We started as roadside sellers before there was an official market.” She lost everything in the fire but says her business had already enabled her to buy a house and land. “We have lost a lot but our efforts from the last 30 years will help us survive this moment. We aren’t completely empty-handed.” At an event organised to raise support for the women affected by the fire, organisers asked people to put politics aside and focus on how to help rebuild lives. “We need to help the girls and mothers of Somaliland, especially focusing on those who are small business owners. There are people who will not even be able to afford to eat after this,” Khadra Aadan, one of those affected by the fire, says.“It’s not enough for us to just feel sympathy for these women, we need to act quickly now.” Sign up for Her Stage to hear directly from incredible women in the developing world on the issues that matter to them, delivered to your inbox monthly:",News/Global development,‘It’s all gone’: the women left bereft when Somaliland’s largest market burned down,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/25/somalilands-largest-market-burned-down-waheen
