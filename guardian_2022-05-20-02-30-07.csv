5/20/2022,"The potter Geoffrey Fuller’s workshop was surely unique in Britain, attached as it was to the 18th-century pub in Derbyshire that he ran for about 35 years. The pub, the Three Stags’ Heads, situated in remote Wardlow Mires, in the Peak District, was very much Geoff’s creation. With his wife, Pat, also a fine potter, Geoff regenerated an old and atmospheric establishment, one that was the ideal showcase for his ceramics. With its warm hospitality, good food and fine ales, it provided the best context for what he held most dear, making work to enhance the domestic space and the dinner table. There must have been drinkers quite unaware that the landlord serving them across the bar was one of the UK’s most remarkable artist-craftsmen. For Geoff, who has died aged 86, was a leading revivalist of native earthenware and slipware, producing low-fired pots and figurative work that drew not only on the vitality of pre-industrial pottery, but on Britain’s rich folk traditions. Geoff developed a repertoire of wheel-thrown and slab-built vessels, as well as a range of highly individual figures that recalled Staffordshire 17th- and 18th-century pew groups and flat-backs, ceramic ornaments for the shelf and mantelpiece that had a wonderfully stylised life and personality but which Geoff reinvented in his own inimitable way. He was responsive to the inherent softness of clay, which he enlivened with fluid glazes that kept his work perennially fresh and generous, and full of what the potter Michael Cardew called “kindness” in ceramics, kindness of spirit, an invitation to handle and use. Geoff’s work had much of the mystery he admired not only in old, anonymous vernacular wares, but in more ambitious pieces too, the work of Staffordshire master potters such as Thomas Toft and Thomas Whieldon. Geoff also loved the elaborate narratives and decoration found on the early commemorative vessels made at Ewenny in Wales and the harvest drinking-wares of north Devon, producing celebratory objects based on their old wassail and posset pots. He enriched his surfaces with applied clay motifs and translucent washes of coloured slips under clear glazes, revealing the textures of the clay beneath. He had strong views on pots that were technically too controlled. He held that the mechanisation of the Industrial Revolution, on the one hand, and overbearing teaching in modern art schools, on the other, had sterilised most contemporary studio work. Geoff strove to give his own pieces freer rein, revelling in the easy plasticity of the material. He made a virtue of its dents and ripples, squeezing and pinching rims to add character to form. His gentle coloration reflected the temperate climate of a north Midlands landscape he knew well; he read keenly about its history, myths and folklore, and walked it with his beloved dogs. Geoff seemed incomplete without his whippets and lurchers in tow, animals that often featured in the humanity and humour of his work. He was born in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, the only child of Fred, a labourer at the nearby Staveley works, and Sarah (nee Ball), an office cleaner. He did national service in the army and then spent 12 years as a librarian in Sheffield, a natural occupation for a book lover. Having become a keen collector of 19th-century Staffordshire figures, in 1965 Geoff decided to study ceramics at Chesterfield College of Art, and then attended the noted ceramics course at Farnham College of Art, Surrey, which was run by the potters Paul Barron and Henry Hammond. This encouraged experimentation with materials and process, bringing out the most unhindered qualities of clay and firing. There Geoff was particularly affected by the teaching of the maverick Canadian potter John Reeve, who strove to discover “the soul of the pot” again, and encouraged Geoff to explore its materiality afresh. He looked at the natural expressiveness of medieval English jugs and Japanese Hagi, Shigaraki and Bizen wares, work that he loved for its imperfections as much as anything else. Initially he made salt-glazed stoneware before later turning to earthenware. After a short period at Farnham as a ceramics technician, Geoff returned to Derbyshire, setting up his first studio in 1972. For many years he taught on the vocational ceramics course at his old college in Chesterfield, where in 1980 he met Pat Davison, one of his students, and a great creative partnership began. After the department closed in 1987 he bought the Grade II listed Three Stags, initially attracted by the potential studio space, but soon relishing his new responsibilities as a publican, opening the pub at weekends so that he and Pat could do their potting during the week. His other great contribution to British pottery came in 2012 when the Fullers, true to their ethos, pitched a marquee adjacent to the pub and set up an annual event to promote and sell the best functional pots and food side by side, hand-picking the exhibitors. Now a major fixture, the Wardlow Mires Pottery and Food festival attracts visitors from all over the UK. Fuller’s first marriage, to Thelma Able, ended in divorce. Pat survives him.

5/20/2022,"Russia has said a further 771 Ukrainian troops have “surrendered” at Mariupol’s besieged Azovstal steelworks, bringing the total number to 1,730 fighters this week, while the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it has started registering the Ukrainian prisoners of war who left the plant this week. The Russian defence ministry said that 80 soldiers who surrendered in the past day were wounded and were being treated in hospitals in the Russian-held cities of Novoazovsk and Donetsk. Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said on Wednesday that more than 900 Azovsteel troops had been sent to a former prison colony in the town of Olenivka but it was not immediately clear where the latest group to surrender had gone. Ukraine has not commented on the evacuation of the soldiers since Tuesday, when Ukraine’s deputy defence minister stated that the soldiers would be swapped in a prisoner exchange, without providing further details. It is also not clear how many soldiers remain inside the plant. Denis Pushilin, the head of the self-proclaimed republic of Donetsk, said on Thursday that more than half the Ukrainian fighters in the bunkers below the Azovstal steel plant have surrendered. Pushilin also repeated statements made earlier by other Russian officials that the soldiers should be tried. “Let them surrender, let them live, let them honestly face the charges for all their crimes,” Pushilin said. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, earlier assured the combatants would be treated in line with international norms for PoWs, though several senior Russian lawmakers demanded they be put on trial and one even called for their execution. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has not publicly commented on the fate of the soldiers since their evacuation started on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the ICRC said it has registered “hundreds of Ukrainian prisoners of war” this week from the Azovstal plant. “The ICRC started on Tuesday 17 May to register combatants leaving the Azovstal plant, including the wounded, at the request of the parties. The operation continued Wednesday and was still ongoing Thursday. The ICRC is not transporting PoWs to the places where they are held,” the Geneva-based humanitarian agency, which has experience in working with prisoners of war, said in a statement. “In accordance with the mandate given to the ICRC by states under the 1949 Geneva conventions, the ICRC must have immediate access to all PoWs in all places where they are held. The ICRC must be allowed to interview prisoners of war without witnesses, and the duration and frequency of these visits should not be unduly restricted,” the agency added. Several Russian outlets and pro-Kremlin telegram channels reporter on Thursday that some Ukrainian soldiers from the Azovstal plant have already been transported outside Donbas to Russian territories. According to 161, a local news outlet, 89 Ukrainian soldiers have been transferred to a detainment facility in the Russian border city of Taganrog where they will face extremism charges in military court for fighting in the Azov regiment, one of the main forces defending the steelworks. Readovka, an outlet with links to the Kremlin, said that the deputy commander of the Azov regiment, Capt Svyatoslav Palamar, who during the siege of the plant made several video appeals urging world leaders to organise an evacuation, was transported to the Russian city of Rostov. The Guardian was not able to independently verify both claims. The Azov regiment was formed in 2014 as a volunteer militia to fight Russia-backed forces in east Ukraine, and many of its original members had far-right extremist views. Since then, the unit has been integrated into the Ukrainian national guard and the regiment now denies being fascist, racist or neo-Nazi. The Azov movement has been used as a key part of the Russian propaganda narrative to justify the war in Ukraine. Next week, Russia’s supreme court will hear an application to designate Ukraine’s Azov regiment as a “terrorist organisation”, opening the way for sentences of up to 20 years for those convicted of involvement. Experts believe that a trial of the Ukrainian troops, described by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, as “heroes”, would further complicate efforts to resume the stalled peace negotiations. Russian presidential aide Sergey Kiriyenko, widely seen as a close ally of Putin, on Thursday said that the Russian leader personally decided that his country would “take oversight” over the two breakaway territories that make up the Donbas, which Moscow has already recognised as independent. It was another sign that the Kremlin was looking to further annex Ukranian territory, after previously hinting that it was open to annexing seized Ukranian territories, including the southern port cities of Kherson and Mariupol. Such moves would further complicate any peace negotiations with Ukraine. Zelenskiy has repeatedly stated that the war with Russia would end only when Ukraine reclaimed everything that Russia took from it since the start of the war in late February. Moscow on Thursday also said that it would open access to Ukraine’s Black Sea port if the west reviewed the sanctions it imposed on the country. Ukraine, one of the world’s biggest grain producers, has been unable to export its goods through seaports since Russia sent troops into Ukraine causing a spike in food prices and fears of a devastating global food crisis.",News/World news,Russia says 771 more Ukrainian troops ‘surrendered’ at Mariupol steelworks,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/19/russia-says-771-more-ukrainian-troops-surrendered-at-mariupol-steelworks
5/20/2022,"Russia’s promise to use lasers to shoot down drones in Ukraine has prompted widespread scepticism that the novel and possibly nuclear-powered weaponry could be deployed on the battlefield or have any significant impact on the war. Yuri Borisov, Russia’s deputy prime minister, told the country’s Channel One television that the new Zadira directed energy weapon could destroy targets up to 5km away, and had incinerated a drone in five seconds in a test. But there was no immediate evidence to back up the claim, while Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, belittled the claim, describing it as a “wunderwaffe” – a nonexistent “wonder weapon” originally a propaganda invention of the Nazis. “The clearer it became they [the Nazis] had no chance in the war, the more propaganda there was about the wonder weapon,” Zelenskiy said. “Russia is trying to find its wunderwaffe. Allegedly laser. All this clearly indicates the complete failure of the invasion.” Laser systems designed to shoot down drones are being gradually developed by the world’s militaries – but most are at a test or prototype stage, and their military utility in a conflict is untried. Last month Israel’s prime minister, Naftali Bennett, said the country’s military had successfully tested a laser interception system called Iron Beam. “It may sound like science fiction, but it’s real,” he said in a breathless tweet. An accompanying video showed lasers locking on to and shooting down rockets, mortars and a large drone with similarities to a Turkish TB2, which has been used by Ukraine in defending against the Russian invasion. Laser weapons work by directed a beam of high energy to burn a target, using large amounts of electricity in the process. In the case of a drone they melt the exterior and destroy enough of it to the point where it cannot fly. Israel’s claim was that it is much cheaper to use laser weapons than missile systems to shoot down rockets, missiles and drones. Bennett said the cost was $3.50 a shot, but it is not clear to what extent this figure includes the cost of power. Some analysts says the Russian systems are powered by small nuclear reactors not dissimilar to those used in submarines. Last year the UK’s Ministry of Defence awarded three contracts worth about £72.5m, two of which were to develop military lasers for frigates and Wolfhound armoured vehicles, with the intention of engaging in “user experimentation” from 2023 to 2025. Publicly declared laser weapons focus on the targeting of drones and missiles. The use of laser weapons to blind soldiers and civilians is banned by a convention signed by 109 countries including Russia and Ukraine. One Russian analyst said Moscow would have to increase production of the weapons to make a difference to the war, in which Russian forces’ attempts to take the Donbas in eastern Ukraine have stalled to the point of near stalemate. Dmitry Stefanovich, a research fellow at the Moscow-based Center for International Security, IMEMO RAS, said: “I think for it to become effective, Russia will need to scale up its production of the Zadira lasers. At the moment there simply isn’t enough to make any real difference.” A related issue is whether Russia had a transportable energy supply to power them. A second analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Moscow’s systems were reliant on small nuclear reactors to power them. “Nothing is being used as far I understand. Russia won’t be using the Zadira or Peresvet lasers in Ukraine. The problem is that these lasers are using nuclear power, which means that if Ukraine would target the installations, it would lead to a small nuclear disaster, exposing the Russian soldiers to radioactive material,” they said. “I believe this is just a lot of hype. I don’t think Russia would move their laser systems to Ukraine with all the risks involved. For example, Peresvet can hit targets within a 5km range, which means Ukraine would also be able to target it.”",News/World news,Zelenskiy compares Russian laser threat to nonexistent Nazi ‘wonder weapon’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/19/zelenskiy-compares-russian-laser-threat-to-nazi-wonder-weapon
5/20/2022,"A man who was morbidly fascinated with the American serial killer Ted Bundy has been jailed for a minimum of 30 years after admitting to the savage murder of the teenager Bobbi-Anne McLeod, who disappeared as she waited for a bus in Plymouth. Cody Ackland, a 24-year-old rock musician, attacked 18-year-old McLeod with a claw hammer in November last year before kidnapping her and carrying out a prolonged attack in a forest, causing “catastrophic” injuries to her head and face. Ackland then drove 28 miles, stripped McLeod and dumped her body close to a beach. In subsequent days he went out with friends and rehearsed with his band, appearing more joyful and affectionate than usual. Three days later he handed himself in and detectives were shocked to find a cache of 3,000 graphic images on his phone revealing his obsession with Bundy, other serial killers and crime scenes. Ackland, from Plymouth, admitted last month to murdering McLeod after seizing her from a bus stop close to her home on the evening of Saturday 20 November. Ackland was not known to police, and friends had no idea of his obsession, but detectives believe he went out looking to kill a stranger. Prosecutors said the similarities between what he did and Bundy’s modus operandi – approaching victims in public places, knocking them out and taking them to a remote spot to kill them – was significant. Judge Linford told Ackland it had been a “prolonged, savage and merciless attack”. He said McLeod had survived for more than 90 minutes after she was first assaulted at the bus stop and that she had been subjected to three separate attacks in three locations before Ackland finally killed her. Linford highlighted that during the attack in the woods McLeod had told Ackland, “I’m scared,” to which he had replied, “So am I.” The judge also noted that Ackland had told police, “Hats off to her,” that McLeod was still alive after one of the attacks. The judge said Ackland, who remained largely impassive as he was sentenced, would indefinitely remain “highly dangerous” and might never be released. As Ackland left the dock, McLeod’s brother, Lee, shouted: “You’re a dead man.” Her mother, Donna, wept throughout and at one point her father, Adrian, had to leave the court. In a victim impact statement, Donna McLeod said her daughter had dreamed of going to college and becoming an interior designer. She asked: “Was she scared? Did she shout out for us?” She said they felt they had let her down by not being able to protect her. After sentencing, the family released a statement paying tribute to “a beautiful girl who lit up our lives and the lives of everyone she ever met”. They said: “She was kind, funny and loyal. She was the best daughter, the best sister, and the best friend to so many people. Everybody who knew Bobbi loved her. Cody Ackland has taken away our world. We will never see her beautiful face or hear her laugh, see her get married or have the children she so wanted. Her not being here is still unimaginable. “We have not been able to say goodbye to Bobbi-Anne and we can only imagine the things he did to her – the thoughts are continually going around in our minds. Why Bobbi-Anne? Why make her suffer? To know her final hours were spent being tortured destroys us inside.” Det Supt Mike West, the head of Devon and Cornwall police’s major crime branch, said there were “clear parallels” between Ackland and Bundy and it was an “exceptional event” for someone with no previous convictions to have acted as he did. “There was no trigger event, there was no escalation of behaviour, there is no indication, whether it be police records or anecdotal information or evidence from anyone that knew him, that there could be any suspicion or concern he could have done anything like this,” he said. In the days before the attack, Ackland researched tools, weapons and possible sites to dispose of a body. West said: “My professional, personal opinion is, he went out with the intent to kill.” West said he thought it was possible Ackland could have killed again. “Whether his desires would have been sated by the attack on Bobbi-Anne, I don’t know.” He called for anyone with concerns about Ackland in the past to come forward. There was no scientific evidence to suggest McLeod was sexually assaulted and Ackland insisted this was not his motive. He said he stripped her to try to hide her identity. The senior crown advocate Richard Posner told Plymouth crown court: “His interest in the macabre presents as deep-rooted; a fascination with death, murder and murderers, and the means to commit murder.” He had hoarded extreme and graphic images of dead and dismembered people, bodies of murder victims, postmortem examinations, deposition sites and artefacts linked to murders, such as weapons. Posner added: “There are numerous images of the American serial killer Ted Bundy in his telephone, and images of weapons he used to kill his victims. Bundy approached his victims in public places and knocked them unconscious before killing them. It is not a coincidence that Bobbi-Anne McLeod met her fate the same way.” Ray Tully QC, defending Ackland, said his client’s obsession with images of murder victims had to be viewed through the “prism” of his mental health struggles. “Psychiatrists characterise it as a kind of self-harm, someone who has developed an addiction to seeking out material, going back to it again and again,” he said. Tully said Ackland described it as “self-medicating” – an attempt to shock himself out of what he felt he was capable of doing – and that his client felt the “storm clouds” were gathering before he killed McLeod. The court was told that Ackland’s feelings of depression lifted afterwards.",News/UK news,Man obsessed with serial killer jailed for murder of teenager Bobbi-Anne McLeod,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/19/man-24-jailed-for-of-plymouth-teenager-bobbi-anne-mcleod-cody-ackland
5/20/2022,"Mark Wood is running out of road as he seeks a return to fitness and a place in England’s T20 World Cup squad in October. The 32-year-old, who was England’s highest wicket-taker over an abject Ashes tour last winter, is part of a lengthy list of injured quicks including Saqib Mahmood, Olly Stone, Matthew Fisher, and as of Thursday, Jofra Archer. Famous for his upbeat disposition, Wood’s demeanour darkened when sharing an update on his injured right elbow that required surgery in March. “At the minute it’s a little bit slow going,” he said. “I’m just struggling to get over that sort of half run-up tempo at the minute just because every time I bowl at the moment there’s still a bit of swelling. But they’ve assured us that that’s normal just because I’ve had surgery five weeks ago so it’s obviously still a little bit raw.” Wood will miss England’s three-match Test series against New Zealand starting next month, though he hopes to play some part in Brendon McCullum’s red-ball team at the back end of the summer. His plan is to build strength through one-day cricket with the aim of securing a seat on the flight to Australia for the next global tournament. “I’d love to be a part of it but there’s plenty of depth in that team now so I’ll have to put in a performance in the summer to prove my case and try to get on that plane,” he said. “In the [last] World Cup I didn’t live up to it so I have to put up performances to make sure I’m there in the winter.” Wood is understandably circumspect when talking about his future. In February he was fit and strong, comfortably England’s fastest bowler and had secured a deal with the Lucknow Super Giants in the Indian Premier League worth £735,000. His body, so often unreliable in the past, was in good shape. Then he felt acute pain while bowling in Antigua against the West Indies. “I’m really disappointed with this injury to be honest,” he says. “The West Indies was a huge disappointment, going there as a perceived senior player I really wanted to give a good account of myself. And then the IPL after would have been a big thing for me personally. “But now I’ve just got to look forward to and take confidence from the bit before where I played quite consistently for a while and felt my performance was getting better and was really starting to show what I could do. So hopefully I can come back with that same mindset.” Wood will return to a fresh environment. He fully endorses the new captain Ben Stokes (his Durham academy teammate), new Test coach McCullum (his first Test wicket) and white ball coach Matthew Mott (a fellow Palm Beach Cricket Club member on Australia’s Gold Coast). He believes that Matthew Potts, an exciting addition to the England squad, is ready for the elite level: “He’s a big strong lad, built a bit like a tank. He has a knack, when you think nothing is happening, he gets a wicket.”",Sport/Sport,Mark Wood in race against time for T20 World Cup after elbow surgery,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/19/mark-wood-in-race-against-time-for-t20-cricket-world-cup-after-elbow-surgery
5/20/2022,"How should we celebrate great comedians? Netflix’s latest exercise in live comedy is called The Hall: a new pantheon for legendary comics, launched onstage at the recent Netflix is a Joke festival in LA. That show now drops on TV, and finds four present-day comedians eulogising a quartet of dead geniuses: the first entries into this new hall of fame, into which acts will henceforth be inducted annually. It’s a worthwhile endeavour, at least if the aim, as creator/director Marty Callner has said, is acquainting today’s audiences with yesterday’s greats. Whether the tone is quite right (is it comedy? Is it ancestor worship?), I’m not sure. For the most part, we don’t really get comedy from the four comedian-hosts. Jon Stewart is first on, sermonising about George Carlin – about his legendary “seven words you can’t say on TV” routine, about his quest to be “actualised as an artist”, about how “as a culture, we [still] miss his voice”. Later, Chelsea Handler hymns Joan Rivers, pausing after every statement she makes about Rivers’ pioneering genius so the audience can dutifully applaud. Fair enough, you might say. Comedians aren’t respected enough. Comedies get overlooked at all the usual award ceremonies; famously, only a handful ever won best picture Oscar. And some of these hall-of-fame acts lived their lives feeling underappreciated. That’s clear from the clips screened here, which include Rivers lamenting her exclusion from comedy’s in-crowd, and Richard Pryor insisting that his comic brilliance – blazingly apparent from this footage – got insufficient credit. But, the question remains: can you have a reverent show about irreverence? There’s something sanctimonious about the atmosphere in The Hall that doesn’t quite square with all these paeans totaking the piss. There is the odd unintentionally funny moment, too, such as when the captions blare “Congratulations, Robin Williams!” and “Congratulations, George Carlin!” for this would-be-prestigious posthumous accolade. (Is that a thing? Can you congratulate dead people?) Peak Rivers or Pryor wouldn’t get through a minute of this without puncturing the piety in as blunt a manner as possible. As it is, the best moments come when the hosts deviate from the worshipful script: John Mulaney poo-poohing the idea that Williams’s comedy was driven by his personal demons (“fuck off with that shit!”), or Jeff Ross bringing some “roastmaster general” energy in a section remembering the standups who have died in the last 12 months. That barbed section splits the difference between reverence and comedy more effectively – but even it must play out to maudlin music, a plink-plonk piano that undercuts Ross’s efforts at boom-tish. You’re thrown back, then, to the archive footage – not all of which has survived the ravages of time. But the best of it makes all this glorifying seem justified. I’m thinking of Williams’s cunnilingus dumbshow, gormless features rising and falling above the crook of his hairy arm; Carlin’s barnstorming “religion is bullshit” routine; or (still breathtaking, 40 years on) Pryor making antic black comedy out of his own heart attack. With a soupcon of self-regard, Dave Chappelle links Pryor to today’s anxieties about what we are and aren’t allowed to say – and talks touchingly about his own relationship with the man he calls “the GOAT”. But based on this first edition, The Hall is a better platform for the inductees than those doing the inducting. Its live element is still reaching for the right tone of voice – whereas the acts being celebrated were (and in posterity, always will be) fully, and sometimes thrillingly, in command of theirs.

5/20/2022,"Your exposé on the dangers of fossil fuel “carbon bombs” (Revealed: the ‘carbon bombs’ set to trigger catastrophic climate breakdown, 11 May) gives us much to worry about. I would like to offer a small ray of hope. Last year, The Hague’s district court held that Royal Dutch Shell was obliged to reduce the group’s CO2 emissions by a net 45% by the end of 2030 relative to 2019. Shell was found to have a legal duty of care to do so, based on the relevant facts of the case, the best available science on climate change and how to manage it, and “the widespread international consensus that human rights offer protection against the impacts of dangerous climate change and that companies must respect human rights”. This linkage between climate change and human rights is a major step towards acknowledging that fossil-fuel-based industries are a significant threat to human rights. It offers a basis for mass legal challenges against the purveyors of carbon bombs. Sadly, the UK and other governments don’t see it this way and continue to subsidise such projects. In this, they may well be complicit in mass violations of human rights. Uncontrolled fossil fuel investment should be seen as a direct threat to the human right to life, and the law should impose severe financial penalties on firms and governments that continue to invest in carbon bomb projects. Unfortunately, the English courts have yet to respond, having thrown out a recent case challenging UK oil regulators’ practices that effectively subsidise further oil and gas investments in the North Sea.Peter MuchlinskiEmeritus professor of law, Soas University of London  This is one of the most disturbing stories we will read this year, not just because of the catastrophe that will surely follow, but also because big oil and governments know the lethal consequences and yet they choose to do it anyway. It seems that they care more about making a dollar than preventing a death. The conversation needs to shift. We still need to hear the climate science, but we must now focus on the inexplicable decisions of fossil fuel executives and governments. What they are doing and planning to do is not yet deemed criminal. However, it is surely time for them to be challenged and held to account? I thank the journalists who unearthed these lethal plans. I hope others will follow to expose yet more detail – lives depend on it.Robert CooperPlymouth  Your recent coverage of carbon bombs said nothing about what is now the key issue shaping the energy transition: energy security. The combination of the energy price crisis and war in Ukraine creates urgency to secure access to new energy resources. But blaming privately owned energy companies for responding to this strong market signal is bizarre. They do not make the market. Unfortunately, democratically elected governments do not control access to the earth’s resources. The world’s playbook for energy transition is a rapid scale-up of clean energy and a transformational change in energy efficiency. It is perfectly within the control of governments and regulators to accelerate both these critical trends. Doing so will send the market the signals required, and then the fear of stranded carbon bomb assets will make them unfinanceable.Andy BradleyDirector, Delta-EE  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

5/20/2022,"At a time when we’re woefully short of GPs, it beggars belief that new recruits are potentially being blocked from working by bureaucratic visa rules (NHS risks losing GPs to ‘nonsensical’ immigration rules, Priti Patel told, 18 May). The BMA has consistently called for reforms to the currrent system, whereby international GPs who complete their training in the UK after three years are unable to get a visa and work in a GP practice unless it has registered as a licensed sponsor. Only after five years’ residence in the UK do graduates receive indefinite leave to remain, meaning a visa is unnecessary. With around 40% of all GP trainees estimated to be international medical graduates, and bureaucratic barriers discouraging practices from becoming sponsors, this potentially means a significant number of newly qualified doctors who could be providing care to thousands of patients are unable to do so. For some, this will mean taking jobs elsewhere in the NHS, but others will choose to leave the country, which will not only deprive patients of care, but also be a waste of the taxpayer money spent training them. There are a number of simple solutions to this. For example, sponsorship could be moved to an umbrella body with overarching responsibility – meaning newly qualified GPs could work at any practice, or the five-year residence rule could be reduced to three years in recognition of the desperate need to increase the workforce. The government has an opportunity to harness the skills of a significant number of doctors to deliver the care that patients so desperately need.Dr Euan Strachan-OrrChair, GP trainees committee, British Medical Association",News/Society,Visa rules for trainee GPs need urgent reform | Letter,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/19/visa-rules-for-trainee-gps-need-urgent-reform

Former DI Angus McIntosh told the inquiry on Thursday: “My recollection is that this was a high-level policy decision, and I certainly was too junior to be a part of this.” Asked why, he replied: “It was a very violent section, and it was often involved in crime, so to put an undercover officer into that would have very, very difficult.” Between 1976 and 1979, McIntosh was the deputy head of a Metropolitan police undercover unit, the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS). The inquiry – led by retired judge Sir John Mitting – is reviewing the activities of 139 undercover officers who spied on more than 1,000 mainly leftwing political groups between 1968 and at least 2010. The current phase of the inquiry is questioning the managers in charge of the covert operations between 1968 and 1982, and is due to end on Friday. In the 1970s, fascist organisations such as the National Front organised provocative marches through areas that had sizeable ethnic minority communities. The communities and anti-fascist campaigners resisted the marches amid public disorder on the streets. Geoffrey Craft, who led the SDS in 1976 and 1977, told the inquiry on Wednesday that police had “other sources in the far right” so it was not necessary to place undercover officers from his unit in fascist groups. This appears to be a reference to another method of infiltration – the use of informants. These are individuals who are members of groups and are persuaded through a variety of means to pass on information secretly to the police. The police used both methods of infiltration – undercover officers and informants – to collect information on leftwing activists. Barry Moss, the head of the SDS during 1980, told the inquiry last Friday: “There was probably a policy decision at that time not to deploy anyone into the far right, because they were too violent, and we were concerned what the officer may have to do to prove his credentials.” Moss blamed leftwing groups for causing disorder when they sought to prevent fascist marches, adding: “If the National Front had just been allowed to demonstrate and the left wing hadn’t turned up, there probably wouldn’t have been any disorder.” An undercover police officer who infiltrated the leftwing Socialist Workers party (SWP) in the 1970s was asked by the inquiry who had initiated the violence on the streets during these demonstrations. He replied: “It depended on exactly where it was and how many people were there. From the SWP side, it was mostly shouting. From the far right thing, it was mostly physical violence.” The SDS, which was founded in 1968, first sent one of its undercover officers to infiltrate the far right in the 1980s. After that, a handful of far-right groups were monitored. An analysis of the political groups that were known to have been spied on by undercover officers between 1968 and 2010 shows that the police overwhelmingly spied on leftwing and progressive political groups.",News/UK news,"Met police chiefs decided not to infiltrate far-right groups in 70s, hears inquiry",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/19/uk-police-took-high-level-decision-not-to-go-undercover-in-far-right-groups-in-1970s
5/20/2022,"Vangelis, the Greek composer and musician whose synth-driven work brought huge drama to film soundtracks including Blade Runner and Chariots of Fire, has died aged 79. His representatives said he died in hospital in France where he was being treated. Born Evángelos Odysséas Papathanassíou in 1943, Vangelis won an Oscar for his 1981 Chariots of Fire soundtrack. Its uplifting piano motif became world-renowned, and reached No 1 in the US charts, as did the accompanying soundtrack album. As well as other scores, he also found success with the group Aphrodite’s Child. Mostly self-taught in music, Vangelis grew up in Athens and formed his first band in 1963, called the Forminx, playing the pop music of the time: uptempo rock’n’roll, sweeping ballads and Beatles cover versions, with Vangelis supplying organ lines. They split in 1966, and Vangelis became a writer and producer for hire, working for other musicians and contributing scores for Greek films. Two years later, he struck out for Paris to further his career, where he formed the prog rock quartet Aphrodite’s Child with Greek expats including Demis Roussos. Their single Rain and Tears was a hit across Europe, topping the French, Belgian and Italian charts and reaching the UK Top 30. After they split – Vangelis deeming the world of commercial pop “very boring” – he returned to scoring film and TV. Turning down an invitation to replace Rick Wakeman on keyboards in Yes, he moved to London and signed a solo deal with RCA Records: his LPs Heaven and Hell (1975) and Albedo 0.39 (1976) each reached the UK Top 40, the former also used to soundtrack Carl Sagan’s popular TV series Cosmos. The connection with Yes was finally completed later in the decade, when he teamed with the band’s Jon Anderson for the duo Jon and Vangelis, whose debut album went Top 5. Vangelis had continued his film score work throughout the 1970s, but it was in the 1980s that this reached its commercial heights. Chariots of Fire became inextricable from Vangelis’s timeless theme, and the music became synonymous with slow-motion sporting montages. “My music does not try to evoke emotions like joy, love, or pain from the audience. It just goes with the image, because I work in the moment,” he later explained. His score to Blade Runner is equally celebrated for its evocation of a sinister future version of Los Angeles, where robots and humans live awkwardly alongside one another, through the use of long, malevolent synth notes; saxophones and lush ambient passages enhance the film’s romantic and poignant moments. “It has turned out to be a very prophetic film – we’re living in a kind of Blade Runner world now,” he said in 2005. Later in the decade he scored the Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins drama The Bounty, and the Mickey Rourke-starring Francesco. He worked again with the Blade Runner director, Ridley Scott, on 1992 film 1492: Conquest of Paradise, and elsewhere during the 1990s, soundtracked Roman Polanski’s Bitter Moon, and documentaries by Jacques Cousteau. Vangelis drew on Greek instrumentation alongside the typical orchestras used in film scoring on Oliver Stone’s 2004 classical epic, Alexander. Continually admired for his evocative Chariots of Fire theme, he was also commissioned by sporting bodies to soundtrack major events, including the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea, and the 2004 Olympics in Athens. He also wrote ballet scores and music for stage productions of Medea, The Tempest and other plays.

5/20/2022,"Millions of people in the UK will be offered further Covid booster shots in the autumn under draft guidance published by the government’s vaccine watchdog. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said another round of jabs would help protect the most vulnerable adults and frontline social care and health workers against severe Covid in the winter. Despite the “considerable uncertainty” over the likelihood, timing and severity of any future wave of Covid in the country, the committee said the threat from the virus would be greatest in the winter months. The interim advice, released on Thursday, aims to help the NHS, care homes and other health care providers plan for the rollout in the months ahead. It calls for a further round of boosters to be offered to more than 25 million people in the UK. Those eligible include staff and residents in care homes for older people, frontline health and social care workers, all those 65 and over, and adults aged 16 to 64 who are in a clinical risk group. “Last year’s autumn booster vaccination programme provided excellent protection against severe Covid-19, including against the Omicron variant,” said Prof Wei Shen Lim, chair of Covid-19 vaccination on the JCVI. “We have provided interim advice on an autumn booster programme for 2022 so that the NHS and care homes are able to start the necessary operational planning to enable high levels of protection for more vulnerable individuals and frontline healthcare staff over next winter.” Prof Jonathan Ball, a molecular virologist at the University of Nottingham, welcomed the move. “We know that immunity to Covid-19 following vaccination or indeed infection contracts over time, so giving those individuals most at risk from developing severe Covid-19 a boost just before virus circulation is likely to pick up during autumn and winter months seems sensible,” he said. “The exact timing will be important, as you don’t want to wait until virus circulation has already started to increase, although hopefully those most at risk have already had their spring booster, which will be standing them in good stead.” Since April, Covid-related hospital admissions and deaths have fallen steadily in the UK, but the same trend was seen in the first two years of the pandemic, before new variants fuelled further waves of infection. The Office for National Statistics estimated that 99% of the UK population have antibodies against Covid but it is unclear what level of antibodies prevents infection. Immunity also wanes over time, and it is unclear how protected people will be as new variants arise. Throughout the pandemic, older people and those with underlying health conditions have been hit hardest by the virus, prompting the JCVI to prioritise the most vulnerable for vaccination. The committee urged those who are eligible for a spring booster to come forward, including those aged 75 and over, residents in a care home for older adults, and people aged 12 years and over who are immunosuppressed. The autumn round of boosters, aimed at more than a third of the population, is expected to draw on the existing Pfizer and Moderna vaccines used in the spring booster campaign, but JCVI will consider other options before issuing final guidance in due course. “As we continue to review the scientific data, further updates to this advice will follow,” said Prof Lim.",News/World news,At least 25m people in UK to be offered Covid booster this autumn,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/19/covid-booster-vaccine-people-in-uk-to-be-offered-this-autumn

5/20/2022,"The domestic repair and emergency services business HomeServe is to be sold to a Canadian alternative investment group in a multibillion-pound takeover deal that will net its founder and his wife almost £500m. The Walsall-based company, which has grown into one of the UK’s largest domestic emergency businesses since being founded nearly three decades ago, accepted a £12-a-share offer from Brookfield Asset Management on Thursday that values the business at £4.1bn. HomeServe, which is growing in the US, Europe and Asia, was founded by Richard Harpin as a joint venture with South Staffordshire Water in 1993. It has been listed on the FTSE 250 since 2004. The deal values Harpin’s 7.38% stake, and the 4.76% controlled by his wife, Kate, at a combined £495m. While the offer is a 71% premium on HomeServe’s share price the day before Brookfield’s interest in the company became public, it is lower than the £13.65 peak in 2020 when the group was seen as a “pandemic winner”. HomeServe said the terms of the offer were “fair and reasonable” and it would recommend the deal to shareholders. Brookfield said it has no current plans to break up the business, which employs 9,000 people directly and has tens of thousands of contracted tradespeople on its books, but intends to carry out a strategic review, including looking at whether parts could be spun off. HomeServe’s core business is selling emergency repairs insurance through utilities suppliers but it also owns Checkatrade, the online platform for matching local tradespeople to homeowners needing services. Huddersfield-born Harpin, 57, co-founded the business in the 90s because he found it so hard to find good tradespeople to reliably carry out repairs at properties in a housing rental business he owned at the time. “HomeServe has become a world-class business with an important purpose – to make home repairs and improvements easy for homeowners and trades,” said Harpin. “I am proud of the company we have built and am delighted that Brookfield is committed to providing long-term capital and global expertise, which I am confident will accelerate progress towards our vision to be the world’s largest, most-trusted provider of home repairs and improvements.” Brookfield, based in Toronto, has Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, as its vice-chairman.

5/20/2022,"When the first Mirror front page dropped with a story about two illicit parties in No 10, most MPs and aides were willing to shrug it off. After all, the serious suits working behind the famous black door are not perceived as a party-mad crowd. Most in Westminster blithely assumed it was a glass of fizz at the desk. One cabinet minister confided at the time that he had shared the dregs of a bottle of whiskey in a near-deserted office with some officials working late just before Christmas, and joked about whether that would see him on the front of the Mirror as well. But even then, trouble was brewing. The details in the original story showed events that had clearly broken the rules – around “40 or 50” people were said to have been crammed “cheek by jowl” into a medium-sized room in No 10 for each of the two events. Now, six months on, as the investigation reaches its conclusion, Whitehall is collectively hanging its head in shame. The scale of the rule-breaking revealed in Downing Street was astounding – quite unimaginable when that first front page dropped on a Tuesday night in November. It is now in all likelihood the street which has received the highest number fines for Covid breaches in the land – 127 in total to 83 individuals, for eight law-breaking events. Some officials have received up to five fines. The Partygate scandal – which Boris Johnson looks to have survived by the skin of his teeth – has taken down a number of other careers, and it may yet have the same effect on Whitehall and Downing Street’s reputation as the expenses’ scandal had for MPs and parliament. It is hard to fathom how the culture developed in the very offices where rules were drafted which banned families holding hands at funerals, saw women give birth alone and kept children apart from their dying parents. The events involved the same people who signed off publicity campaigns with the pictures of exhausted nurses in PPE and the slogan: “Look her in the eyes and tell her you never bend the rules.” They were organised by the aides who prepared the briefings for the prime minister and senior officials at nightly press conferences, where the public were repeatedly told that to breach the rules could cost someone their life. Some of the details of the parties – with more likely to come in Sue Gray’s final report – appear so egregious as to be almost comical. Invites to “bring your own booze” to the Downing Street garden, suitcases wheeled in full of alcohol, “wine-time Fridays”, a child’s swing broken, “raucous karaoke” with Whitehall’s head of propriety and ethics, and a senior aide DJ-ing in the basement at the leaving do for a spokesperson who now works for the Sun. For those in Whitehall who worked in other departments, most working at home through the pandemic, the rule-breaking has almost defied belief. Sources describe a “saviour complex” that spread through civil servants in No 10 during the darkest days of the pandemic, when most of the others in Whitehall were working from home. “They were working together all day in an office, but it is still hard to understand what they were thinking to allow things to develop as they did,” one civil servant said. Jill Rutter, a former senior civil servant now at UK in a Changing Europe thinktank, said there were serious questions about the culture emanating from the top which the Gray report is expected to investigate. “In the civil service you take your lead from senior leadership because it is a hierarchical culture, and that is also a culture set by politicians. If the head of propriety and ethics (Helen Macnamara) was there and it was in the Cabinet Secretary’s Office, you would think well, this is probably all right. “And when you’re working in quite small environment, and if you’re relatively far down the food chain, it’s very hard to be the one who says: ‘I’m not sure we should be doing this’.” There is widespread feeling that junior officials have taken the bulk of the fines for the Partygate scandal. Some civil servants have also found themselves brought into harsher disrepute, a source of sympathy from colleagues, including the Sheffield council chief executive, Kate Josephs, who remains suspended from her job after her leaving do from the Cabinet Office was investigated by police. The prime minister’s former spokesperson Allegra Stratton is also viewed as having been treated harshly, being forced to resign after a video emerged of her joking about one of the parties. Political aides such as No 10’s chief of staff, Dan Rosenfield, and head of communications, Jack Doyle, were also casualties – though their departures always seemed to be more related to how the fallout was handled rather than the breaches themselves. In contrast, the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, appears not to have been fined and others, including the prime minister’s former principal private secretary Martin Reynolds, who organised the BYOB summer party, has been quietly moved to a different post at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. There is particular internal opprobrium towards Case, who was described by one Whitehall source as a “submarine” who had offered no leadership or counsel on the multiple hits to civil service morale – including new job cuts and the tabloid crusade against home working. “People trusted their bosses and they got fined, you’d think someone might acknowledge that at some stage,” one said. Rutter said a key moment would be what the Gray report concludes about the wider leadership in No 10 and the Cabinet Office. “The prime minister could be standing up and saying, I just have to take responsibility for the fact that I allowed a culture at the centre of government to develop where a lot of normal, law-abiding people going about their daily jobs got the impression that it was acceptable to have these sorts of events going on – and I’m truly sorry to them. Or you get the senior civil servants standing up and doing the same,” she said. “For now, they say sorry for the individual things they have done, but nothing more.”",News/World news,The shaming of Whitehall: how the Partygate scandal unfolded,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/19/the-shaming-of-whitehall-how-the-partygate-scandal-unfolded
5/20/2022,"Carlos Sainz has warned he fears for the long-term health of Formula One drivers because of the violent bouncing they are being subjected to on track. The Spanish Ferrari driver said he will discuss the issue with other drivers with a view to bringing it up with the FIA. Speaking in the buildup to his home grand prix this weekend in Barcelona, the 27-year-old was unequivocal in expressing his concern over the effects of what is known as porpoising – the car bouncing on straights as it gains and loses ground-effect downforce – on the necks and backs of drivers. The problem has plagued many teams on the grid, including Ferrari and Mercedes, and was an unexpected side-effect of this year’s new regulations. “We need to consider how much of a toll a driver should be paying for his back and his health in a Formula One career,” he said. “With this kind of cars’ philosophy we need to open a debate more than anything. “I have done checks on my back and neck tightness and this year it is tighter everywhere, I am already feeling it. I don’t need expert advice to know that 10 years like this is going to be tough.” The Mercedes driver George Russell had previously warned the health issues were unsustainable and that after the Emilia Romagna GP at Imola he had suffered with back and chest pains from the porpoising. To combat it teams have been running their cars with stiffer suspension, which pushes more impact force through the driver, exacerbated by the increased weight of these cars, which was making it harder to deal with, Sainz said. “To run as stiff for our necks and backs as we are having to run lately with this car mass, it’s a question for F1 and everyone to think about,” he said. “How much a driver needs to pay a price in his career and his health in order to combat it. I am thinking long term.” The new regulations were brought in with the intention of increasing overtaking, which thus far seems to have worked, and Sainz acknowledged it was the right direction for the sport to take, but insisted the unforeseen side-effects must be considered. “There is the interest of the teams, of overtaking, of the show you need to factor in the equation but what if we for the first time also factor in the driver? It could be interesting,” he said. “It will get to a point that if we decide to go in certain direction the FIA needs to get involved. It’s still a new idea for me and I need to talk to other drivers like George that are struggling with the same phenomenon, to sit together to see what we can offer or propose.”",Sport/Sport,Carlos Sainz worried over health of F1 drivers due to bouncing on track,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/19/formula-one-carlos-sainz-worried-health-drivers-bouncing-porpoising

5/20/2022,"About 25 fishing boats have sailed into the mouth of the River Tees while setting off flares and fireworks in a protest over mass marine deaths that are ruining livelihoods as well as being a “huge ecological disaster”. More than 200 well-wishers, many representing conservation and environmental campaigns, cheered from the shore, chanted “Stop the sludge” and sang protest songs. Large wash-ups of dead crabs, lobsters and other marine life have been reported on England’s north-east coast since October. A government investigation in February ruled out dredging as the cause and concluded that a naturally occurring algal bloom was the most likely culprit. However, fishers have rejected that explanation, blaming the dumping of contaminated, dredged sediment, and want the investigation reopened. “Emotions are running very high,” said Sally Bunce, a marine mammal rescuer, one of hundreds supporting the protest from the shore at South Gare, a spit of land in Redcar at the mouth of the Tees. “These fishermen have had no income for eight months and they are getting no help from anybody. Farmers get compensated for BSE, avian flu … The fishermen have got nothing. “We still have crab and lobster washing up dead on beaches in their thousands. We’ve got seal pups that are dying of starvation.” The boats came from harbours between Scarborough and Hartlepool. One of the protesters was Joe Redfern, a co-founder of Whitby Lobster Hatchery and the chairman of Whitby Commercial Fishing Association, who said: “We are facing a huge ecological disaster. “It is deeply concerning. The catch rates have dropped; there is no life in the rock pools; there are dead and dying marine animals washing up and in our pots.” Campaigners say the blame for the deaths lies with 250,000 tonnes of dredged sediment from the Tees that was dumped two and a half miles offshore. David McCreadie, a retired marine biologist and oceanographer, came across one of the first dead lobsters last October and stopped walking his dog on the beach. “Within weeks, there were hundreds of dogs going to the vets, ill,” he said. Rowan McLaughlin, a co-coordinator of the South Tees Green party who attended the protest, said: “I’m here because I live by the sea. All this affects me. It affects my family; it affects jobs … We shouldn’t be polluting our sea. This idea that it is an algal bloom is just nonsense.” A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “We are monitoring recent wash-ups at South Gare and the Tees area. Small-scale wash-ups can occur naturally due to seasonality and weather conditions and we are working closely with partner agencies to support the monitoring and recovery of stocks. “We note that there are reports of poor catches and we are working with the industry and partner agencies to monitor this and are communicating regularly with the fishing community.” The company PD Ports, which manages the estuary, said it shared concerns about the large number of dead crustaceans along the shoreline. A spokesperson said that because they were the statutory harbour authority “we are required, by law, to dredge the river on a regular basis to ensure safe navigation and maintenance of the 12-mile stretch of river within our jurisdiction. “All dredging and sediment disposal takes place in compliance with strict environmental regulations by the Marine Management Organisation and Environment Agency, and is overseen by our expert team of marine and environmental specialists. “In addition to fulfilling our statutory legal requirements, this activity supports a thriving river and helps sustain thousands of livelihoods across the Tees valley and wider north-east, which are dependent on the river for global trade.”",News/Business,Fishers hold River Tees protest over mass crab and lobster deaths,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/19/fishers-river-tees-protest-mass-crab-lobster-deaths

Winning his fourth Ivor in five years, Dave was commended for his second album We’re All Alone in This Together, which topped UK charts and spawned three simultaneous top 10 singles – Clash (featuring Stormzy), Verdansk and In the Fire. As part of his continuing collaboration with Fredo, the rapper also co-wrote the hugely successful tracks Back to Basics and Money Talks, the Ivors Academy said. Following a Brit award win for best hip-hop/grime/rap act earlier this year, Dave dedicated his award to “the rappers that have suffered for years and years, and broken down so many barriers in this industry that I’m in right now”. Fender took home his first Ivor after winning best song musically and lyrically for the track Seventeen Going Under, which chronicles his life at the age of 17 and the challenges he and his mother faced. The North Shields singer-songwriter recently sold out his “biggest gig to date” at Finsbury Park in London, following in the footsteps of Arctic Monkeys, Queens of the Stone Age, Pulp and Liam Gallagher.

It is Sheeran’s fifth Ivor, after he won in the same category in 2019 alongside McDaid for Shape of You. With a catalogue of more than 140 songs and more than 80m record sales, a special international award celebrated the global impact and songwriting achievements of the Colombian superstar Shakira. The award for best contemporary song went to Dean “Inflo” Josiah Cover and Little Simz for I Love You, I Hate you, a powerful address to Little Simz’s father from the album Sometimes I Might Be Introvert. Inflo was nominated for four awards this year, more than any other person. In total, 21 songwriters and composers collected Ivor Novello awards across 14 categories at a ceremony at London’s Grosvenor House on Thursday. Laura Mvula won the award for best album for Pink Noise, which she wrote with Dann Hume. “Sometimes it was hard to imagine getting to the finish line, so to know that it has made some impact in such strange times is really exciting for me,” Mvula has told the Guardian. Breakout talent Naomi Kimpenu became the third consecutive female songwriter to win the rising star award for her debut EP Prelude. The four-track collection was described as “the ideal calling card, serving notice of what her perfectly poised vocals and sincere songwriting can do”. Meanwhile, the “icon” award recognised “two of rock’s most inspiring, influential, and identifiable songwriters”: the Cure’s Robert Smith and Simon Gallup. Peter Gabriel received the fellowship of the Ivors Academy in recognition of his outstanding contributions as a musician, innovator, humanitarian and songwriter. Daniel Blumberg won the award for best original film score for his work on The World to Come, Arthur Sharpe won best television soundtrack for his work on Sky Atlantic’s Landscapers, and Richard Jacques won best original video game score for Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy. Paul Heaton was awarded outstanding song collection, while the songwriters Elizabeth Fraser, Robin Guthrie and Simon Raymonde won the visionary award for their band Cocteau Twins. Shaznay Lewis, Ivor award winner and chair of the Ivors awards committee, said she was “absolutely thrilled” for this year’s winners. “It is a privilege to experience such an immensely powerful, emotive and eclectic range of music. Huge congratulations to everyone who took home awards, and every single songwriter and composer nominated,” she said. The Ivors Academy recently launched TheWRD, a pre-degree diploma in creative entrepreneurship designed to help open access to the creative industries. It was also announced that Lauren Laverne would take over as host from Paul Gambaccini, who retires after hosting the ceremony since 1988.",Arts/Music,Dave crowned songwriter of the year at Ivor Novello awards,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/19/dave-crowned-songwriter-of-the-year-at-ivor-novello-awards
5/20/2022,"The system of executive pay is “broken”, the Church of England’s pension board has said, as it challenged more companies to ease the pain of soaring inflation by committing to paying workers the living wage. On the day retailer Next approved a 50% pay rise for its chief executive, Adam Matthews, the Church’s chief responsible investment officer, called out examples of “excessive pay” at large companies in a post on LinkedIn. On Thursday, shareholders in Next backed the company’s decision to reward Simon Wolfson with £4.4m this year, the highest level since 2015, despite opposition from some investors concerned about the disparity between executives and the wider workforce. Matthews, who manages £3bn of investments, voted his shares against the increase. Explaining the decision, he wrote: “We can sound off on radio and vote against but we need to recognise that fundamentally the executive pay system we have isn’t working. “This is particularly egregious at a time that many of the workers in many of these companies will be struggling with the growing costs of living. You have major increases in executive pay in consumer facing companies such as Next where the work force are not accredited as being on a living wage.” A spokesperson for Next said: “Given the challenges facing the retail sector, Next does not anticipate increasing wages above the national living wage as it prioritises protecting jobs.” Companies which are accredited as living wage employers have committed to paying all of their employees a rate based on living costs, which stands at £9.90 an hour across the UK, and £11.05 in London. Matthews said he would be inviting the board chairs and chairs of remuneration committees, and meeting with other fund managers, to discuss reforms. He added: “There is a societal crisis unfolding before us and in the UK you have over three-quarters of churches involved in supporting food banks that are not just providing food to people out of work but those in work that cannot make ends meet. So as a pension fund we will be convening a meeting of asset owners, with key fund managers to look at this broken system that is enabling excess.” His comments followed a warning on Wednesday from Martin Lewis, founder of the consumer advice site Money Saving Expert, that financial desperation could lead to “civil unrest”. Households already struggling with soaring food and energy bills face a further hit when the energy price cap rises for the second time this year in October. “The public mood is desperate, it’s angry and we may well be moving towards, if we don’t sort this when those bills rises come in October to £2,600 in the middle of winter, I worry about civil unrest,” he told ITV’s Peston programme. The Institutional Voting Information Service (IVIS), which is part of the Investment Association and advises investors on corporate governance, had marked Next’s annual remuneration report with a “red top” warning, suggesting that shareholders vote against. Despite the opposition, just 7.5% of shareholders challenged the plan to pay Wolfson an annual bonus worth 100% of his basic salary and two share bonuses based on long-term performance. Activists from Share Action and Labour Behind the Label who attended Next’s AGM in Leicester, the centre of the UK’s garment-making industry, asked the company’s executives why workers in factories which supply garments to Next were not paid the living wage. They reported that Wolfson listened carefully to them, but did not promise change. Other firms including the owner of Wagamama, the Restaurant Group, have also come in for criticism in recent weeks over executive bonuses. The group – which also owns the Frankie & Benny’s and Chiquito chains – paid its chief executive, Andy Hornby, £1.2m last year up, up from £518,000 a year earlier. Meanwhile, Tesco has been criticised for paying its chief executive £4.75m last year, including the highest annual bonus awarded by the supermarket since 2016, at a time when families are being hit by soaring food price inflation. Despite this, Matthews wrote there was rarely widespread backlash from investors: “There are occasional rebellions of shareholders, but then attention diverts and we all waste our time trying to decipher ever complicated justifications for excessive pay.”",News/Business,Next chief to get 50% pay rise to £4.4m despite shareholder opposition,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/19/next-shareholders-agree-to-44m-pay-package-for-chief-despite-opposition
5/20/2022,"The England and Sussex seamer Jofra Archer, whose injury troubles have kept him out of all forms of cricket since last July, has been ruled out for the rest of the English summer after suffering a stress fracture to his lower back. The 27-year-old becomes the third England seamer to be diagnosed with the same injury in the past week, after Lancashire’s Saqib Mahmood and Yorkshire’s Matt Fisher. Mark Wood, Olly Stone, Chris Woakes, Sam Curran and Ollie Robinson were also unavailable for selection for the first Test squad of the summer, announced on Wednesday, because of injury or illness. Dr Peter Alway, research and operations manager at the England and Wales Cricket Board with a PhD in the field of lumbar stress fractures, said that bone density lost during Covid lockdowns could be contributing to the spate of injuries. “Fast bowlers have very, very adapted spines,” he said. “The loads are around 100 times the impact of running and, in response, they get super dense spines. But if you don’t bowl for a while that adaptation decreases and you lose the protection offered by it. Covid lockdowns deconditioned bowlers a considerable amount. It could be a contributing factor.” Alway said research had shown that bowlers lose between 3% and 5% of their lumbar bone density within the first eight weeks of enforced inactivity. “That number may not seem like a lot but the rate of loss is equivalent to what we see from astronauts in space,” he said. “It’s basically as fast as anyone has ever seen bone density decrease.” Archer’s setback comes a week before the start of Sussex’s Vitality Blast campaign, in which he was hoping to make his comeback from a long-term elbow injury. In a statement the ECB said that “no timeframe has been set for his return” and that “a management plan will be determined following further specialist opinion over the coming days”. It is more than a year since Archer last played international cricket, a Twenty20 against India in Ahmedabad last March. He missed last year’s T20 World Cup and the Ashes because of the injury to his elbow, which was operated on last May and again in December. His latest setback has put in doubt his participation in this year’s T20 World Cup, which starts in Australia in October. Archer admitted this month that he had feared his career might be over during his long spell out of the game. “In a situation like this, when you are forced to have operations, you do think about whether you are going to play cricket again,” he said. “It’s natural for anyone to worry about the future in that kind of situation. Suppose I had rushed my comeback, I might have messed things up more or injured something totally unrelated to what I had done previously and then I would be even further down the pecking order.” A documentary about the career of the new England Test captain, Ben Stokes, the filming of which was revealed in February by the Guardian, will be released on Amazon Prime this year. In the documentary the 30-year-old discusses the mental health crisis that temporarily forced him out of the game last year. Phoenix from the Ashes, executive produced by the Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes and based around a series of interviews between him and Stokes, also features contributions from several international teammates and family members. In it Stuart Broad says that before Stokes took a break from the game to prioritise his mental health he was sufficiently troubled that “I could have seen him never playing again”. “I never thought that I would feel like I do now,” Stokes says in one interview included in the newly released trailer. “My anxiety has gone through the roof. You are sat on the toilet in your hotel room and you are having a massive panic attack.” In a video played at the announcement in London on Thursday Stokes, who is in the Durham side playing Middlesex at Lord’s in the County Championship this week, said: “I still think it’s crazy sat here that there’s a documentary being done about me. And then on top of that having Sam come and do the interviews. The whole thing is a crazy experience still for me to think about.”",Sport/Sport,Jofra Archer ruled out for season in latest England injury setback,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/19/jofra-archer-ruled-out-for-season-in-latest-england-injury-setback-cricket
5/20/2022,"Haleh Afshar, Lady Afshar, who has died aged 77 of kidney failure, was an Iranian-born scholar whose life’s work was one of the most contentious subjects of our time: Islamic feminism. She spent most of her academic career at the University of York, where she was professor of politics and women’s studies from 1999, and her advisory roles with the government on engaging with women led to a life peerage in 2007. She wrote or edited many books, including Iran: a Revolution in Turmoil; Islam and Feminisms; and Women in the Middle East: Perceptions, Realities and Struggles for Liberation. Her scholarship was rigorously academic but her ideas had real-world consequences: she used the Qu’ran to promote women’s rights to own property, to contribute to public debate, to be paid for housework. She saw no contradiction in describing herself as both a feminist and a Shia Muslim. Her thinking can be summarised in her forthright critical assessment of the government of Iran when it barred the way to education for women: “They’re scared of educated women. Because educated women can actually read classical Arabic, access the Qur’anic teachings, and demand their rights, contextualised in the Qur’anic teachings … taking on the Iranian government on its own terms.” Women’s education and women’s voices were at the centre of her work. I first met Haleh more than 20 years ago when I was director of the Women’s National Commission, which, until its abolition in 2010, was the British government’s official independent advisory body on women. She was appointed in 2008 as one of 12 independent commissioners, with the remit of bringing the informed opinion of women to government. Haleh’s activism was indistinguishable from her theoretical work. She was a fighter as well as a scholar, and she fought, usually successfully, for women threatened with deportation. After the 7/7 bombings in London in 2005 she was invited to chair a new independent committee to advise the government on the views of women in the British Muslim community. This was the brainchild of Patricia Hewitt, then the Labour government’s minister for women and equality, and under Haleh’s leadership the committee made the case for listening to Muslim women’s voices. Haleh led a roadshow round the UK to hear what British Muslim women were saying, and she fought hard to make sure the subsequent report was published exactly as it stood, resisting pressure to water it down and dealing openly with difficult issues, such as child sexual abuse. The members of that committee went on to form the independent Muslim Women’s Network, of which Haleh was a founding member and later honorary president, its mission of empowering Muslim women through Islamic feminism being close to her heart. She was born in Tehran, the daughter of an affluent family. Her mother, Pouran Khabir, was a successful campaigner for women’s suffrage. Her father, Hassan Afshar, was a law professor at Tehran University and also served as a government minister. Educated first at the Jeanne d’Arc school in Tehran, at the age of 14 she persuaded her parents to let her board in the UK at St Martin’s school in Solihull, which she later described as “dark and drab” after a childhood under the Iranian sun. After A-levels at college in Brighton, in 1963 she enrolled at the then brand-new University of York, graduating in social sciences in 1967. In 1972 she took a diploma in comparative European law at the University of Strasbourg, followed by a doctorate in land economy at Cambridge University in 1974. Haleh returned to Iran in the last decade of the shah’s rule, working in the land reform ministry, and as a journalist. She spent time visiting remote villages, talking to the people, especially to women. She became aware that, in an authoritarian regime, there was widespread ignorance about women’s Islamic rights. This formative experience set a pattern for her life: to challenge power. Soon she fell out with the land reform minister. That proved to be just the start – she fell out of favour with the entire regime with the publication of an article exposing gossip around the Iranian royals. She finally fled Iran as persona non grata. The fall of the shah and his secret police was followed by the arrival of the ayatollahs and theirs. She would never return to her homeland. After a lectureship at Bradford University from 1976 to 1985, she was appointed to York, lecturing in health economics before moving into the department of politics and the centre for women’s studies in 1987, becoming professor in 1999 and emeritus in 2011. She was also visiting professor of Islamic law at the Robert Schuman University in Strasbourg. In 2008 she made an appearance on BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, revealing an eclectic taste in music, ranging from Persian love songs to the Beatles’ Yellow Submarine, and a mischievous, unforgettable and idiosyncratic style. She pushed boundaries and prodded at privilege. Her home was a place of extraordinary hospitality and warmth, where students and friends from all over the world thronged to enjoy Iranian cooking and stimulating conversation. Shakespeare’s phrase “though she be but little she is fierce” might have been written for Haleh. Yet her fierceness was tempered by a wonderful pealing laugh and charm that could disarm her most implacable opponents, be they religious leaders or government ministers. She was made OBE in 2005 and a member of the House of Lords in 2007, where she sat as a crossbencher. She was an academician of the Academy of Social Sciences and held honorary doctorates from the universities of Essex and Bradford. She married Maurice Dodson, emeritus professor of maths at York University, in 1974, and they had two children, Ali and Molly. Haleh was dogged by health problems, always disguised by her apparently endless energy and enthusiasm, but she was given a new lease of life when Maurice donated a kidney. He survives her, as do their children and their grandchildren, Kate and Hattie.

5/20/2022,"The former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder will lose some of his post-office privileges after failing to cut his links with Russian energy companies over the Ukraine war, the Bundestag’s budgetary committee has decided. Schröder, who was German head of government from 1998 until 2005, will be stripped of his office and staff, which cost about 419,000 euros (£354,500) in taxpayers’ money in 2021. The motion, which was passed on Thursday afternoon with support from Schröder’s own Social Democratic party (SPD), the Greens, and the Free Democratic party (FDP), does not name the politician’s Kremlin connections or stance on the Ukraine war, most likely to avoid legal challenges. Instead, the motion argues that the former leader no longer fulfils any continuing obligation as a statesperson and therefore does not require an office and staff to do so. The main opposition party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), backed the move even though it had also called on the government to cut the ex-chancellor’s pension, equivalent to an annual salary of about 100,000 euros. Schröder will keep his pension payments as well as his security detail. The four employees who used to work at Schröder’s office, located almost directly opposite the Russian embassy on the Unter den Linden boulevard in Berlin, already resigned of their own accord in early March, after their boss had showed no intention of stepping down from his boardroom roles at Russian oil company Rosneft and pipeline company Nord Stream. The Bundestag budgetary committee’s vote comes just hours after the European parliament urged the commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, to impose sanctions against Schröder because of his ties to the Kremlin. The EU legislature passed a resolution on Thursday that said sanctions after the invasion of Ukraine should be extended “to the European members of the boards of major Russian companies and to politicians who continue to receive Russian money”. As well as the German politician, the motion indirectly addresses former Austrian foreign minister Karin Kneissl, a supervisory board member at Rosneft who danced with Vladimir Putin at her own wedding in 2018. Schröder’s close personal friendship with Putin has come under heavy criticism after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, and the SPD leadership has called on the 78-year-old to hand in his party membership. The Hanover-based politician has come across as unrepentant, however. “I don’t do mea culpa,” Schröder told the New York Times in April. “It’s not my thing.”",News/World news,Gerhard Schröder to be stripped of privileges for not cutting ties with Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/19/gerhard-schroder-to-be-stripped-of-office-for-not-cutting-ties-with-russia
5/20/2022,"Consumers could be hit with higher egg prices as UK farmers reduce their flock numbers, in response to escalating costs and insufficient profit margins. The numbers of chicks being placed by egg producers in April was down 15% year on year, according to the latest government figures. Egg farmers have been warning for months that a “tidal wave” of rising costs in feed, energy, labour and packaging was not being reflected in retail prices.They have criticised supermarkets for ignoring industry warnings, with a leading producer telling delegates at the British Pig and Poultry Fair last week he expected a shortage of eggs later this year given the cuts in chick placings. The government data, published on Thursday, confirms a decline in producers restocking their flocks with new birds. The number of eggs being set by hatcheries fell even further in April, down 35% on the previous year. The number of chicks being placed by egg producers indicates the number of eggs that will be available to consumers in the months ahead. Hen eggs take about 21 days to hatch, but chicks do not start laying until they are aged about 20 weeks. Any reduction in chicks now will not affect the availability of eggs until the autumn. The existing hens on farms will continue producing eggs until they are 70 to 80 weeks old, but the overall flock population will fall as hens are not replaced. “It’s showing what we were predicting, that there will be a shortage unless retailers respond by raising prices,” said Robert Gooch, chief executive of the British FreeRange Egg Producers Association. Gooch says producers need a 3p per egg price increase to forestall a much bigger price rise when supplies fall later this year. Retail egg prices in May were up by about 8%, or 15p, per half dozen from last year, according to Trolley.co.uk, a supermarket price tracker. “If you were making money you wouldn’t do it [not restock]. You only do it because you can’t make a profit. It’s a crisis for producers and it will translate into a crisis for consumers later this year,” said Gooch. Andrew Opie, from the British Retail Consortium, said supermarkets sourced most of their food from the UK and “know they need to pay a sustainable price to farmers to ensure British eggs remain on the shelves”.A spokesperson for the British Egg Industry Council said chick placements did historically rise and fall depending on factors such as how long producers decide to keep their existing hens before replacing them. “However, with the current cost crisis, some producers are choosing not to repopulate their houses.”Sign up for the Animals Farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the biggest farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

5/20/2022,"Chemical pollution in the environment is supersizing the global obesity epidemic, according to a major scientific review. The idea that the toxins called “obesogens” can affect how the body controls weight is not yet part of mainstream medicine. But the dozens of scientists behind the review argue that the evidence is now so strong that it should be. “This is critical because the current clinical management of obese patients is woefully inadequate,” they said. The most disturbing aspect of the evidence is that some chemical impacts that increase weight can be passed down through generations by changing how genes work. Pollutants cited by the researchers as increasing obesity include bisphenol A (BPA), which is widely added to plastics, as well as some pesticides, flame retardants and air pollution. Global obesity has tripled since 1975, with more people now obese or overweight than underweight, and is increasing in every country studied. Almost 2 billion adults are now too heavy and 40 million children under five are obese or overweight. “The focus of the clinical people is on calories – if you eat more calories, you’re going to be more fat,” says Dr Jerrold Heindel, lead author of one of the three review papers, and formerly at the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. “So they wait untill you get obese, then they’ll look at giving you diets, drugs, or surgery. “If that really worked, we should see a decline in the rates of obesity,” he said. “But we don’t – obesity continues to rise, especially in children. The real question is, why do people eat more? The obesogenic paradigm focuses on that and provides data that indicate that these chemicals are what can do that.” Furthermore, the scientists say, the approach offers the potential to prevent obesity by avoiding exposure to pollutants, especially in pregnant women and babies: “Prevention saves lives, while costing far less than any [treatment].” The evidence for obesogens is set out by more than 40 scientists in three review papers, published in the peer-reviewed journal Biochemical Pharmacology and citing 1,400 studies. They say these chemicals are everywhere: in water and dust, food packaging, personal hygiene products and household cleaners, furniture and electronics. The review identifies about 50 chemicals as having good evidence of obesogenic effects, from experiments on human cells and animals, and epidemiological studies of people. These include BPA and phthalates, also a plastic additive. A 2020 analysis of 15 studies found a significant link between BPA levels and obesity in adults in 12 of them. Other obesogens are pesticides, including DDT and tributyltin, former flame retardants and their newer replacements, dioxins and PCBs, and air pollution. Several recent studies link exposure to dirty air early in life to obesity. The review also names PFAS compounds – so-called “forever chemicals” due to their longevity in the environment – as obesogens. These are found in food packaging, cookware, and furniture, including some child car seats. A two-year, randomised clinical trial published in 2018 found people with the highest PFAS levels regained more weight after dieting, especially women. Some antidepressants are also well known to cause weight gain. “That is a proof of principle that chemicals made for one thing can have side effects that interfere with your metabolism,” said Heindel. Other chemicals with some evidence of being obesogens included some artificial sweeteners and triclosan, an antibacterial agent banned from some uses in the US in 2017. Obesogens work by upsetting the body’s “metabolic thermostat”, the researchers said, making gaining weight easier and losing weight harder. The body’s balance of energy intake and expenditure through activity relies on the interplay of various hormones from fat tissue, the gut, pancreas, liver, and brain. The pollutants can directly affect the number and size of fat cells, alter the signals that make people feel full, change thyroid function and the dopamine reward system, the scientists said. They can also affect the microbiome in the gut and cause weight gain by making the uptake of calories from the intestines more efficient. “It turns out chemicals dumped in the environment have these side effects, because they make the cells do things that they wouldn’t otherwise have done, and one of those things is laying down fat,” said Prof Robert Lustig at the University of California, San Francisco, and lead author of another of the reviews. The early years of child development are the most vulnerable to obesogens, the researchers wrote: “Studies showed that in utero and early-life exposures were the most sensitive times, because this irreversibly altered programming of various parts of the metabolic system, increasing susceptibility for weight gain.” “We’ve got four or five chemicals that also will cause transgenerational epigenetic obesity,” said Heindel, referring to changes in the expression of genes that can be inherited. A 2021 study found that women’s level of obesity significantly correlated with their grandmothers’ level of exposure to DDT, even though their granddaughters were never directly exposed to the now banned-pesticide. “People need to know that [obesogenic effects] are going on,” Lustig said. “Because it affects not just them, but their unborn children. This problem’s going to affect generation after generation until we get a hold of it.” Directly proving a causal link between a hazard and a human health impact is difficult for the simple reason that it is not ethical to perform harmful experiments on people. But strong epidemiological evidence can stack up to a level equivalent to proof, such as with tobacco smoking and lung cancer. Lustig said that point had been reached for obesogens, 16 years after the term was first coined. “We’ll never have randomised control trials – they would be illegal and unethical. But we now have the proof for obesogens and obesity.” The obesogen paradigm has not been taken up by mainstream researchers so far. But Prof Barbara Corkey, at Boston University School of Medicine and past president of the Obesity Society, said: “The initial worldview was that obesity is caused by eating too much and exercising too little. And this is nonsense. “It’s not the explanation because all of the creatures on Earth, including humans, eat when they’re hungry and stop when they are full. Every cell in the body knows if you have enough food,” she said. “Something has disrupted that normal sensing apparatus and it is not volition. “People who are overweight and obese go to tremendous extremes to lose weight and the diet industry has fared extremely well,” Corky said. “We’ve learned that doesn’t work. When the medical profession doesn’t understand something, we always blame patients and unfortunately, people are still being held responsible for [obesity].” Lustig said: “Gluttony and sloth are just the outward manifestations of these biochemical perturbations that are going on beneath the surface.” How much of the obesity pandemic may be caused by obesogens is not known, though Heindel said they will have an “important role”. Lustig said: “If I had to guess, based on all the work and reading I’ve done, I would say obesogens will account for about 15% to 20% of the obesity epidemic. But that’s a lot.” The rest he attributes to processed food diets, which themselves contain some obesogens. “Fructose is a primary driver of a lot of this,” he said. “It partitions energy to fat in the liver and is a prime obesogen. Fructose would cause obesity even if it didn’t have calories.” A small 2021 trial found that an ultra-processed diet caused more weight gain than an unprocessed diet, despite containing the same calories. Cutting exposure to obesogens is difficult, given that there are now 350,000 synthetic chemicals, many of which are pervasive in the environment. But those known to be harmful can be removed from sale, as is happening in Europe. Heindel said prospective mothers in particular could adjust what they eat and monitor what their children play with in their early years: “Studies have shown modifying diets can within a week or so cause a significant drop in several obesogens.” Lustig said: “This cause is very pervasive and pernicious, and it’s also lucrative to a lot of [chemical] companies. But we must address it rationally.” To do that, the “knowledge gap” among doctors, regulators and policymakers must be addressed, the scientists said. “It’s time now that [obesity researchers and clinicians] should start paying attention and, if they don’t think the data is strong enough, tell us what more to do,” said Heindel, who is organising a conference to tackle this issue. Corkey is yet to be fully convinced by the obesogen paradigm, but said the concept of an environmental toxin is probably the right direction to go in. “Is there proof? No, there is not,” she said. “It’s a very difficult problem, because the number of chemicals in our environment has just astronomically increased. “But there’s no alternative hypothesis that to me makes any sense and I would certainly challenge anyone who has a better, testable idea to come forth with it,” she said. “Because this is a serious problem that is impacting our societies enormously, especially children. The problems are getting worse, not better – we’re going in the wrong direction as it stands.”",News/Environment,"Environmental toxins are worsening obesity pandemic, say scientists",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/19/environmental-toxins-are-worsening-obesity-pandemic-say-scientists
5/20/2022,"Sri Lanka has defaulted on its debts for the first time in its history as it struggles with an economic and political crisis triggered by global shock waves from the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. An inflation rate spiralling towards 40%, shortages of food, fuel and medicines and rolling power blackouts have led to nationwide protests and a plunging currency, with the government short of the foreign currency reserves it needed to pay for imports. The Sri Lankan central bank governor said on Thursday that the oldest democracy in Asia had fallen into a “pre-emptive default” on its debts after the expiry of a 30-day grace period for missed interest payments on two of its sovereign bonds. It is the first default by an Asia-Pacific nation this century, according to the credit rating agency Moody’s. Sri Lanka said last month that it would stop repaying its international debts to conserve dwindling foreign currency reserves, vital for importing key raw materials from overseas. Speaking on Thursday after the deadline passed for making $78m (£62.8m) of payments to international creditors, Nandalal Weerasinghe, the central bank governor, said: “Our position is very clear: until there is a debt restructure, we cannot repay.” Sri Lanka has suspended repayments on about $7bn of international loans due this year, out of a total foreign debt pile worth $51bn. The country’s finance ministry has said it has $25m in usable foreign reserves. Economists fear Sri Lanka could be the first in a wave of defaults, as other low- and middle-income countries struggle with runaway inflation and supply shocks. The IMF has opened rescue talks with Egypt and Tunisia, both big importers of wheat from Russia and Ukraine, and with Pakistan, which has imposed power cuts because of the high cost of imported energy. Turkey is battling 70% inflation but has so far avoided the need for a bailout. Weerasinghe told a news conference on Thursday that adequate dollars had been released to pay for fuel and cooking gas shipments, helped by $130m from the World Bank and remittances in foreign currency sent home by Sri Lankans working overseas. The central bank alongside the government has begun discussions with the International Monetary Fund aimed at working towards a programme to address its economic challenges. “Expeditious arrangements are being made to commence the external debt restructuring process,” it said. Negotiations have also been started to obtain bridging finance to secure foreign currency required to finance imports of essential goods and to strengthen the nation’s social safety net programmes, it added. Sri Lanka’s new prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, said this week that the crisis would get worse in the next couple of months before it could get better. The worst economic crisis since Sri Lanka’s independence in 1948 has led to the resignation of Mahinda Rajapaksa as prime minister after months of protests that involved violent, fatal clashes on the streets of the capital. The Covid pandemic had triggered a collapse in tourism, leading to a fall in foreign currency income and rising debt levels – a situation made worse by the surge in global commodity prices this spring, exacerbated by Russia’s war in Ukraine.

5/20/2022,"The Metropolitan police have confirmed that Boris Johnson will not receive any more fines for lockdown-breaching gatherings after an investigation into events in Downing Street and Whitehall. The police force said it had issued a total of 126 fixed-penalty notices, covering all 12 events investigated. Here, people tell the Guardian about the family members they lost during lockdown and how they feel about the outcome of the investigation. I’m beyond outraged. One [fixed-penalty notice] should have been enough anyway as it proved he misled parliament. How is he still PM? I find it insulting, disgusting and depressing in equal measure. It’s an indicator of how low morals are in the Conservative party generally, and it’s alarming to watch him lie. I lost my dad in April 2021. He was admitted to Treliske hospital, who informed us they could not save him from bacterial pneumonia. I do not know if he knew the prognosis. We were unable to be with him at the end, which was devastating for us as a family. I cannot say more than that as I find it too upsetting to recall. The only blessing is he did not have to witness how low Johnson has dragged the reputation of the UK, and the terrible damage he is inflicting upon us. He was 95 and got ill. I cannot blame Johnson for that, but the manner of his death and subsequent restrictions on his funeral were due to laws made by this government which Johnson ignored with impunity. He treats us with contempt and I cannot look at him without feeling physically sick. I am not alone. Penny Roberts, 62, NHS administrator, Illogan, Cornwall I used to think that there was a certain base level of fairness in our society which overrode privilege and position. No longer. I think that all the fines that were extracted from the rest of the population for organising or presiding over gatherings should be repaid. I know it will never happen but I still think it should. I’m not much of a royalist but the image I can’t get out of my mind is the Queen sitting alone at her husband’s funeral. The head of state obeying the rules to the letter. I cannot imagine how Scotland Yard will be able to justify this. It will further erode confidence in the Metropolitan police. Peter Grimsdale, 67, author, former Channel 4 head of religion In September 2020, my grandmother died alone, with no members of her family around her. Only three of us were able to even go to her funeral. We were extremely close and I had always promised her that I would not let her die alone. I had to break that promise because of the laws which were made and broken by Boris Johnson and his team. I will never forgive them. The prime minister was responsible for the laws which were made at the time, and should be held to AT LEAST an equivalent standard to anybody else. If there was an event which other people have been fined for attending, and he also attended the same event, I find it incomprehensible that he should not also be fined. He should be answerable for every event which took place at Downing Street during the whole period, it being both his home and his workplace. Either he knew about all of them (even if he managed to resist attending any of them) and is therefore culpable, or he didn’t know what was going on around him involving his family and staff, and he is therefore incompetent. Alex McKeown, 43, teacher, West Sussex I am amazed, but at the same time, not surprised. Johnson (and his enablers/colleagues) have done more in the last few years to erode public trust in government and other institutions than any other government at any point I can remember in my lifetime, and it is that which perhaps worries me more than this particular incident. The behaviour of Johnson and his cabinet falls far short of what we should expect of our leaders; the lying, self-serving approach, the blatant cronyism – is causing people now, more than ever, to think that there is absolutely no point in voting or engaging in politics, because it won’t make any difference. And this is the worst point of all. People now assume that there is nothing they can do and simply give up. Jim Rennie, 54, works for software company, Wallasey If there are no more fines due, that’s not a problem as long as the full and due process was carried out. It’s all about the PM being treated fairly but without favour too. Now there should be an immediate publication of the full and unredacted Sue Gray report. There’s no excuse for any more delay. Jon Gray, 44, university lecturer, Derbyshire I’m bored of the whole thing. It’s political points scoring by both sides. Pretty well everyone I know, and know of, broke the strict rules at some stage. There are bigger problems to sort out than having a drink, having a small gathering, having a curry. We are not a Chinese-style police state. Let’s move on. Mark, 62, lawyer, London I am appalled. He was at the same events as other people who received fines for being there. Why wasn’t he fined again? It’s honestly not surprising. If the Tories want to tie themselves to his sinking ship then let them. They are completely and utterly out of touch on everything that relates to the general public, including Partygate and the cost of living crisis. The leader of our country should be adhering to the highest of standards; there are no excuses and he is not fit to lead. The prime minister broke the law whilst at work. If I had done that I would’ve been sacked. His status and position of power enable him to get away with this behaviour and I am disgusted that his fellow Tory MPs are allowing it to carry on.

5/20/2022,"The EU ambassador to the UK has rejected Liz Truss’s demand that the Northern Ireland protocol be rewritten, and issued a blunt warning of retaliation if the government passes a law disapplying aspects of the agreement. “Unilateral calls for unilateral; action calls for action,” João Vale de Almeida told journalists at Westminster. He lamented the continuing distrust between the two sides, and argued little had changed in the past 18 months since the government was threatening to pass the internal markets bill. “I’m worried about the low levels of trust that exist today, between the EU and the UK: between our leaders, between all of us that are involved in this relationship,” he said. “Some people call it a saga. If this is a saga, if I look at the new season of the saga, it looks pretty much like a similar plot. Not much has changed.” “We have the same narrative,” he added. “Using legislation to override an international treaty. I feel myself back in the fall of 2020, with the internal markets bill.” Vale de Almeida insisted there was no prospect of a change in the negotiating mandate given by the EU to its Brexit representative, Maroš Šefčovič – a demand made repeatedly by the foreign secretary. “We were told that we should get a new mandate. Well, I can tell you very clearly, what the member states are telling us is very simple: you don’t need a mandate, and even if you ask for one, you will not get it,” he said. “We can’t renegotiate the protocol: the ink on the signatures is hardly dry”. Truss set out her intentions in a dramatic statement earlier this week, in which she said she preferred a negotiated solution but set out plans for a bill that would rework aspects of the protocol. The stakes in the dispute have been raised since the DUP refused to take part in a power-sharing executive at Stormont unless the protocol is radically altered. Changes mooted by the government include creating a “green channel” to allow goods to pass without checks from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, as long as they are not destined for the Republic of Ireland. It would give the UK more powers to change VAT in Northern Ireland. But Vale de Almeida rejected the proposal. “The problem with this approach, we believe, is that it does not necessarily solve any problems, and it most likely creates more problems.” He suggested instead that the UK government return to proposals for applying the protocol already made by the EU. Truss rejected these as making the situation worse – but Brussels said ministers have not yet fully engaged with them. “We believe that what we put on the table, the potential of those proposals is not yet exhausted,” the ambassador said. “There is untapped potential in those proposals for us to find solutions – provided we are focused on finding solutions.” He argued that rocky relations over the protocol were having a knock-on effect on other aspects of the UK-EU relationship – including the UK’s participation in the Horizon programme of scientific cooperation. Acknowledging the importance of UK scientists to the scheme, Almeida conceded that it was “collateral damage” in the standoff over the protocol.",News/Politics,EU ambassador rejects Liz Truss’s demand to rewrite NI protocol ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/19/eu-ambassador-rejects-liz-trusss-demand-to-rewrite-ni-protocol
5/20/2022,"The dissident Russian film director Kirill Serebrennikov is calling for the lifting of sanctions on Roman Abramovich, one of the investors behind his latest film. The Russian oligarch, now trying to sell Chelsea football club because of financial restrictions imposed on on him by the British government, was a valuable patron of the arts, said the director. Abramovich’s record as a sponsor of important cinema should be taken into account, Serebrennikov added, speaking at the Cannes film festival. “We have to lift the sanctions against Abramovich. He has been a real patron of the arts and in Russia this has always been appreciated,” the director said after Wednesday night’s premiere of his film Tchaikovsky’s Wife, which is in competition for the festival’s coveted Palme d’Or prize. Serebrennikov is one of the few Russian film-makers asked to participate in the festival this year and he is using the platform to argue against a blanket boycott of art and culture from Russia in Europe. According to festival organisers, Serebrennikov’s competition entry is eligible because its production predated the war in Ukraine, although it is not clear if the decision is in line with current European sanctions on the financial interests of Russian oligarchs. Ukrainian delegates at Cannes have questioned the timing of the filming itself, which they allege may have continued into April. Questioned on Thursday, Serebrennikov said he had not received money directly from the Russian state since he was a student. Funds, he said, came then through the civil service, not directly from wealthy individuals. “Up to that point it was not toxic money,” he said. “There was nothing shameful about it.” He added that Abramovich’s film foundation, Kinoprime, had helped to fund his last two films. Tchaikovsky’s Wife portrays the troubled marriage of the composer Pyotr Tchaikovsky and Antonina Miliukova, and examines repressive 19th-century attitudes to homosexuality, to women and to mental health. A Cannes regular in recent years, Serebrennikov took part last year remotely, owing to the pandemic. His joy at attending in person this May was overshadowed by the war in Ukraine, he said. “I am not totally happy to be here because there are bombs falling on cities,” he said. The director explained his criticisms of the war have created problems for him in Russia. In 2020, Serebrennikov was convicted of embezzlement and given a suspended prison sentence, having previously criticised Russia’s seizure of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and spoken out in support of Russia’s beleaguered LGBTQ+ community. “I was called into court and then I was released on bail. So I came to Europe, because that is where the work is.” This year the festival has not accepted official Russian delegations, and Serebrennikov questioned the widespread nature of such bans. “I can understand that people are calling for a boycott, but I don’t accept it,” he said. “What is happening in Ukraine is very painful. It’s unbearable,” he added, explaining that he believed “This Russian imperialist thrust should stop.” But he said he did not see that a comprehensive culture ban was the answer. “Culture is air, it is water and it is clouds, and so is totally independent of nationality,” he said. The issue of Russia’s place in the film industry, and of the role of entertainment during a war, continues to dominate the opening days of the festival, taking its cue from the speech that Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy delivered at the festival by screen on Tuesday. “Will cinema keep quiet, or will it speak up? If there is a dictator, if there is a war for freedom, once again everything depends on our unity. Can cinema stay outside of this unity?” Zelenskiy asked. Thursday also saw the premiere of the documentary Mariupolis 2, put together from the salvaged footage of a new project in Ukraine being made by the Lithuanian film-maker Mantas Kvedaravičius. Kvedaravičius was killed in the conflict, but his fiancee Hanna Bilobrova brought the footage the director had already completed to a special screening set up in the Palais des Festivals. Cannes will also see the controversial screening of The Natural History of Destruction, directed by Sergei Loznitsa, Ukraine’s best known film-maker, who is also of Russian and Belarusian descent. In March, the Ukrainian Film Academy expelled Loznitsa because he did not support its call to boycott all Russian movies. Serebrennikov was asked if he would donate the proceeds of Tchaikovsky’s Wife to Ukrainian war victims, something Abramovich has said he will do with money he receives from the sale of Chelsea FC. The actor Alyona Mikhailova, who plays the composer’s wife in his film, was visibly moved when Serebrennikov replied that he wanted support for Russian families who are badly affected by the war as well as for Ukrainians. “It is very important to help all the victims. People in Russia are traumatised, too, and some cannot work any more or they have left their families,” Serebrennikov said. His producer, Ilya Stewart, explained that it was unlikely there would be any proceeds. “We are very far away from earning money on this film. The background is that it was an investment in the arts.” Returning to his call for sanctions on the Chelsea FC owner to be lifted, Serebrennikov said: “Abramovich created Kinoprime to support the best Russian films in recent years and these are certainly not propaganda films, rather the contrary. Zelenskiy also asked that he should not be under any sanctions because he can be one of the key people to forge a peace.”",Arts/Film,Russian Cannes contender defends Roman Abramovich as a ‘patron of the arts’,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/19/roman-abramovich-kirill-serebrennikova-russian-cannes-patron-of-the-arts
5/20/2022,"Global finance leaders should prepare for multiple inflationary shocks, the head of the International Monetary Fund has warned, as fears of a global economic downturn continue to hit markets around the world. The IMF’s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, said it is becoming harder for central banks to bring down inflation without causing recessions. Speaking at the sidelines of a meeting of G7 finance ministers and central bank chiefs in Germany, Georgieva cited mounting pressures on energy and food prices from Russia’s war in Ukraine, supply chain disruption and cost pressures caused by China’s zero-Covid policies. “I think what we need to start getting more comfortable with is, that may not be the last shock,” Georgieva said, adding that the outbreak of the Omicron coronavirus variant late last year had shown that inflation would not be a “transitory” one time shock. Inflation has risen to its highest level in about 40 years in both the UK and the US this year, and is the highest it’s been in the eurozone since statistics began in 1997. Investors fear that central banks risk a “hard landing”, pushing economies into recession, as they raise interest rates to bring inflation down towards target. London’s stock market tumbled into the red on Thursday, with the FTSE 100 index closed down 135 points or 1.8% at 7,302. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index was down 1.3% with personal care companies, food and beverage companies, tech stocks and retailers all weakening. Wall Street opened lower, a day after its worst selloff in nearly two years, as major retailers reported that rising inflation was hitting consumer spending and eating into their profit margins. US department store chain Kohl’s slashed its profit and sales outlook, echoing Target and Walmart earlier this week. US jobless claims rose for the third week in a row, with 218,000 Americans seeking unemployment support last week. A survey of manufacturers in the Philadelphia region showed that growth almost stalled this month, as rising costs hit factories. “The reality is no matter which way your turn, warnings signs are flashing,” said Fiona Cincotta, senior financial markets analyst at City Index. Inflation hit confidence at UK factories too, where investment plans remained weak, according to the latest industrial trends reports from business body the CBI. The number of manufacturers planning to lift their own prices remained near a record high. The Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, has indicated that the US central bank will raise interest rates by 50 basis points in June and July, in its determination to pull US inflation down from 8.3% in April. That has driven up fears of a global slowdown. Joost van Leenders, senior investment strategist at wealth manager Van Lanschot Kempen, cautioned that the Fed wasn’t usually able to achieve a soft landing. “A recession is usually necessary to quash inflation. There is a slightly greater chance of a soft landing though if there are no major imbalances in the economy, especially if families and businesses don’t hold finance deficits. And, as it happens, that’s exactly the situation we’re in at the moment. A positive outcome is therefore possible, although the Fed has its work cut out,” Van Leenders said.",News/Business,IMF chief warns of multiple inflationary shocks amid market jitters,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/19/imf-chief-warns-of-multiple-inflationary-shocks-amid-market-jitters
5/20/2022,"Suppose the chancellor wanted to follow Scottish Power’s advice, and give Britain’s most hard-up households £1,000 towards their energy bills this winter? Would it be possible to raise the £10bn needed in a way that didn’t just tax the same people he would be trying to help? I can think of at least three options, any of which would do the job, and all of which would make the tax system better as well. First, Rishi Sunak could raise capital gains tax rates to match income tax rates, and reintroduce an inflation allowance, as his predecessor Nigel Lawson did in 1988. It was the top recommendation by Sunak’s own advisers, the Office of Tax Simplification, in 2020. This could raise up to £16bn. While some people will doubtless delay cashing in gains to avoid the tax, the chancellor should comfortably reach £10bn even accounting for this. A reformed capital gains tax would also be fairer, reducing the opportunity for some to game the system to pay lower effective tax rates. Second, he could apply national insurance contributions consistently across all sources of income. If you earn an average income, you’ll be paying 13.25% in national insurance on every extra pound you earn. Someone with a higher income ­– your MP, for example, on a salary of almost £85,000 – is paying only 3.25%. And landlords pay a tidy 0%. Other oddities include that national insurance is currently at zero after pension age, even for those in work, and effectively 1.25% on dividends. Fixing all these inconsistencies to tax all income consistently would raise more than £30bn, so the chancellor would have some money to spare to cut taxes, invest in education, or undo the cuts to the aid budget. Third, he could introduce an annual wealth tax of 1.1% on individual wealth above £10m, after netting off mortgages and other debts. This would raise £10bn from the wealthiest 0.04% of the population. For this group the usual economic arguments against a wealth tax, for example that it discourages savings, do not apply. There are also practical benefits, as existing taxes on wealth are not effective at raising tax from this group: a government report in 2018 showed that they are able use reliefs to pay just a 10% effective rate of inheritance tax – half the rate paid by individuals with £2m in wealth. Each of these options is good economics, raises some much-needed money, and would improve the tax system. But none should deter the chancellor from a fourth bit of good economics: a windfall tax on energy companies. Their current higher profits are nothing to do with their own efforts, and everything to do with the economic fallout of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Labour says this could raise £2bn as a one-off, but there are no independent estimates yet. However, it is Economics 101 that such windfalls should be taxed highly. Whatever it raises can then be put to constructive use, whether supporting low-income households or funding incentives for green investment. There are plenty of options for the chancellor to ease the cost of living crisis. Imagine if he were brave enough to implement them all.

5/20/2022,"Like all good detective stories, the tale of Wagatha Christie ended with a twist. Coleen Rooney failed to turn up for the final day of the libel trial that has gripped the nation, choosing to go on a long-planned family holiday rather than watch the curtain fall on this particularly excruciating drama. The sight of one footballer’s wife accusing another of leaking intimate snippets from her private Instagram account to the Sun has become a guilty pleasure for many, a bit of light relief from worrying about the gas bill; two parts juicy celebrity gossip to one part fashion parade, it has teetered irresistibly on the brink of farce. Yet beneath the froth there were glimpses of something darker, a reminder of the human toll that judgment takes on all involved. A tearful Rebekah Vardy, who launched this case after Rooney had publicly implicated her in the leaking of stories about the latter’s private life, told the court that her former agent had been “driven to suicidal thoughts by the proceedings”, which have been rumbling on since 2019. Coleen’s husband, Wayne, meanwhile said he had watched her “really struggle” with the legal battle hanging over her head for two and a half years, becoming “a different mother, a different wife”. All the Rooneys wanted, he argued, was to put it all behind them. Your heart may not bleed for wealthy wives who could surely have settled their differences less painfully in private. But if these two found it stressful waiting for the chance to prove who leaked what from whose Instagram stories, then imagine how the victims of far greater injustices feel about waiting years for their day in court. Beyond the glossy high-profile world of celebrity trials, the wheels of justice for ordinary people now grind so slowly as to be visibly seizing up. One of the more depressing factors in the case of the unnamed MP arrested and then bailed this week on suspicion of rape and other offences is that the allegations were reportedly first made in January 2020. It has taken almost two and a half years even to reach this stage of investigation; the MP has not at the time of writing been charged, but if any trial is to follow, then it could still be many months away. The case of his former parliamentary colleague Charlie Elphicke, convicted in 2020 of sexual assault, took three years to reach court. These are just the delays we hear about, but countless other ordinary people are now stacked in the same cruel holding pattern: by the end of last December, 25% of cases in England and Wales had been waiting a year or more to come to court, and the number waiting more than a year had more than trebled since March 2020, when Britain first locked down. Behind those numbers are victims who can’t move on from a trauma they know they’ll have to relive in court, witnesses worrying that with every passing day their memories grow hazier, and defendants, too, whose lives are in limbo. The Conservative party’s handling of the unnamed MP, who has not been suspended but merely asked to refrain from attending parliament, may be partly coloured by fear of yet another byelection. But it also reflects a dilemma facing other employers over how to deal fairly with someone who may or may not be guilty, when it could be years before the courts produce a definitive answer. This week the four inspectors variously of prisons, probation, the Crown Prosecution Service and the constabulary gave evidence to the Commons justice select committee, over what they say is the now parlous state of the criminal justice system, post-pandemic. Some prisoners are still spending upwards of 22 hours a day locked up in their cells, the committee heard, leaving no time for meaningful rehabilitation and raising the likely risk of reoffending. In more than half of probation cases examined, assessment and management of the risk of harm offenders posed to the public was deemed unsatisfactory. The courts meanwhile are struggling not only with a backlog of cases built up well before the pandemic, but with a mutiny among criminal lawyers that now threatens to bring the system to its knees. A world away from Vardy v Rooney, with its suave and formidably expensive QCs, the everyday business of the criminal courts relies heavily on lawyers paid by the state to defend people who can’t afford their own representation. For duty solicitors, that means racing to police stations in the middle of the night to take critical decisions on behalf of often difficult, occasionally violent, clients and then slogging through the casework in return for fees that (according to a government-commissioned review) have fallen overall by up to 45% in real terms since 1996. Some junior lawyers are now effectively paying for the privilege of working, according to the London Criminal Courts Solicitors’ Association, whose members will next week start refusing to take on low-paid cases such as burglary in protest. The association’s president, Hesham Puri, a criminal legal aid solicitor himself, says that “our goodwill has run out and will no longer prop up a broken justice system”. Criminal barristers have already imposed a form of work-to-rule, refusing to take on last-minute cases returned by colleagues, which only increases delays. The lord chief justice warned this week that “more and more cases are not going ahead because either the prosecution or the defence have not been able to find an advocate”. Even court buildings themselves are starting to crumble: one sketchwriter sniffily described the courtroom in which Vardy met Rooney as somewhat “mouldy” but in some lowlier courts, clerks are putting buckets out to catch rain leaking through the roof. It’s a cliche to say of the kind of celebrity trials that end up dragging both sides through the mud – be that the Rooney-Vardy circus or the vitriolic grudge match currently being fought out between Johnny Depp and his ex-wife Amber Heard – that nobody wins but the lawyers. For ordinary people caught up in Britain’s underfunded criminal justice system, however, it’s increasingly more accurate to say that nobody wins full stop. Not the victims whose agony is prolonged by delays; not defendants waiting to clear a stain from their name; not even the lawyers, apparently now voting with their feet for more lucrative work. Boris Johnson is said to be keen to focus on crime now that the Metropolitan police has finished investigating his own Covid law-breaking.

5/20/2022,"Sigmund Freud was unavailable for comment, but George W Bush saying Iraq instead of Ukraine when condemning “a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion” certainly suggests he still has a lot on his unconscious mind. The former president jokingly attributed the slip to his 75 years, but there has always been a faulty connection between his brain and his tongue. There are whole books full of “Bushisms”, like his boast that people “misunderestimated” him, and how much he felt for single mothers “working hard to put food on your family”. There may have been something Freudian about his 2004 warning that America’s enemies “never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we”. And then there was the time he was thanking an army general for his service in 2008, telling him he “really snatched defeat out of the jaws of those who are trying to defeat us in Iraq”. Bush has already told us that the fiasco of Iraq’s non-existent weapons of mass destruction still troubles him. “No one was more shocked and angry than I was when we didn’t find the weapons,” he wrote in his memoir, Decision Points. “I had a sickening feeling every time I thought about it. I still do.” But Bush sought to justify the 2003 invasion anyway, on the grounds that Saddam Hussein was a vicious despot “pursuing” weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and therefore the US was safer without him in the world. The 43rd president was making a similar argument to an audience at his presidential library in Dallas when he made his gaffe on Wednesday. Bush was making a distinction between a democratically elected Volodymyr Zelenskiy, “the Churchill of the 21st century”, and the rigged elections and despotism of Vladimir Putin’s Russia, where the absence of checks and balances led to “the decision of one man to launch a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion of Iraq – I mean Ukraine”. The audience laughed along, but the mistake was a reminder that the world is still living with the consequences of that invasion. It broke Iraq and set off a sectarian civil war in which hundreds of thousands of people died. Nearly two decades on, it continues to weaken the US on the world stage, and is undoubtedly a factor in the ambivalence of countries in Africa and the Middle East over joining a decisive global response to Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Putin has cynically copied from the Iraq playbook the Bush administration left behind, with spurious claims of Ukrainian WMD. The US failure to prosecute war crimes by US troops and contractors, its use of torture in the “global war on terror” and Bush’s campaign to undermine the international criminal court, all contributed to a more permissive environment for the many crimes against humanity that have followed Iraq, from Syria to Ukraine and well beyond.

5/20/2022,"‘She was a stubborn, indomitable, unconquerable creature. Nothing could tame her, nothing could daunt her,” said conductor Thomas Beecham, speaking in 1958 about the composer Ethel Smyth. “She is of the race of pioneers, of path-makers,” agreed her friend Virginia Woolf. “She has gone before and felled trees and blasted rocks and built bridges and thus made a way for those who come after her.” “She’s badass. I’d love to have met her,” says Jeffrey Lloyd-Roberts. The tenor sings in a new production of Smyth’s 1906 opera The Wreckers, which makes its debut at Glyndebourne on 21 May, and will be performed at the Proms this summer. Her music is “incredible”, the conductor Robin Ticciati says. “She uses the brass and the timps as weapons, blades!” Smyth wrote six operas, a mass, countless chamber works and even a ballet, but she is best known today for her 1910 song The March of the Women, which became the official anthem of the suffragette movement. She was a passionate activist, throwing bricks through the windows of the homes of cabinet ministers – which led to a two-month jail sentence. Beecham recalled visiting her in Holloway prison: “On this particular occasion, the warden said: ‘Come into the quadrangle.’ There were a dozen ladies, marching up and down, singing hard. He pointed up to a window where Ethel was leaning out, conducting with a toothbrush, also with immense vigour and joining in the chorus of her own song The March of the Women.” The Wreckers is set in a remote corner of 18th-century Cornwall where villagers live a precarious existence plundering ships lured on to the rocks, and invoking ancient salvage rights that allow them to murder shipwrecked crew for profit. But when two of the community resist this and the strictures of their own roles, tragedy ensues. Lauren Fagan sings the role of Avis, one of the two central female characters. “She’s a really awesome and exciting person to sing,” Fagan says. “She makes bold decisions. I’m feeling quite empowered and strong, even if at the end Avis too is cast out of the community.” For the director, Melly Still, the work reflects the defiant, unorthodox views of its creator. “Librettist Henry Brewster and Smyth were clear that they weren’t making this a piece about the Cornish people and wrecking specifically,” Still says. “For them it was a symbol of Britain and its insularity.” Little about Smyth was ordinary, from her bisexuality to her determination to compose on her terms, and refusal to accept that her voice was any less important than that of her male counterparts. “I would certainly call The Wreckers a feminist opera,” Still says. “It’s about the women in it finding their voice. Its central character, Thurza, tries to break free from the restricted world she is forced to live in. And Smyth subverts all the operatic tropes. She made the moral heart of the opera a mezzo, a voice type normally consigned to the witches/bitches/breeches roles; and the soprano, Avis, is a really feisty character – not the classic transgressor saved by a prince charming.” As much as it’s about defiance and individual freedoms, Ticciati adds, the opera is about how a community turns into a mob. With its dark narrative of scapegoats and violence and its remote coastal setting, the work has parallels with Benjamin Britten’s opera Peter Grimes, although Britten said he did not know Smyth’s work. It’s hard to imagine he didn’t come across bits of it at the Proms: in the 35 years between 1913 and 1947, 27 separate Prom seasons featured either The Wreckers’ Overture or its Prelude to act 2. Productions and complete recordings, however, were few and far betweeneven during Smyth’s lifetime, and Glyndebourne’s staging is the first professional one done in French, the language in which the opera was originally written. The history of Smyth’s opera is as dramatic as the Cornish coast where it is set. Smyth’s librettist, Brewster (her lover and lifelong friend), was a bilingual French/English speakers. Smyth, who studied in Leipzig, was steeped in European musical traditions and spoke German and French fluently. Their decision to write the libretto in French is likely to have been a pragmatic one. “The conductor at the time at Covent Garden was the French-born André Messager. Perhaps she thought ‘a French conductor is bound to put this on,’” Still says. Smyth also hoped that a French-language opera would find a more receptive audience over the Channel where she felt there wasn’t the same divide between “composers” and “female composers”. She was, however, wrong on both counts, and it was in German, not French or even English, that the Wreckers was premiered, in Leipzig in 1906. The performance was well received, but Smyth was horrified by cuts made to the third act and, when the conductor refused to reinstate the missing passages, she marched into the orchestra pit herself and removed the musicians’ parts and the full score, and took them on a train to Prague. An under-rehearsed performance there was a disaster and although her work had found a fan in Gustav Mahler, his hopes to put her opera on in Vienna in 1907 came to nothing. Back in England the indomitable Smyth persuaded Beecham to listen to her work, as he recollected. “She came to me in a very excited state. She said, ‘You have got to conduct my opera The Wreckers … Will you come and see me, and I will go through it with you?’ She played the whole piece through, mostly the wrong notes, but with a vigour and elan that was really very inspiriting.” And so 1909 saw six performances at Her Majesty’s theatre, and then, the following year, at Covent Garden – the first opera by a woman to be produced there. “Smyth and a poet friend of hers translated the French into a very kind of baroque Edwardian ladies’ poetry, and there were cuts to shorten the work. But as soon as you start cutting, the character and all the complexity vanishes and it all becomes quite two-dimensional,” Still says. Even so, Smyth’s opera was a success – even King Edward VII came to see it – but then her work all but disappeared from opera houses. A semi-staging at the Proms in 1994 brought her back to the Royal Albert Hall, and in 2006 Cornwall’s Duchy Opera staged a reduced and newly translated English version of The Wreckers in its centenary year. The opera has however, never been performed as Smyth originally wrote it. “We wanted to go right back to the source” says Ticciati. “Opera in its original language flows better,” says James Rutherford, singing Laurent. “The minute you change something there’s always a compromise. Going back to the original makes you think: ‘OK, this is obviously what was intended.’” “We’re all still waiting to hear what it sounds like,” l Ticciati. The London Philharmonic Orchestra are yet to join rehearsals at Glyndebourne to bring Smyth’s passionate and rich score to life; up to this point, Ticciati, Still and the cast have had only fragments of recordings; rehearsals have been with a pianist repetiteur rather than the full orchestra. And what will it sound like? “When you don’t know a composer and their language, you start by comparing their music to others,” says tenor Rodrigo Porras Garulo, who sings Marc. “She has such a big vocabulary that sometimes you think you’re singing Cavalleria Rusticana, sometimes you think you’re singing Debussy, sometimes a Schubert song, other times Irish folk songs. It’s very mixed, and that’s the beauty of it.” “My role starts with light French melodies, then there’s a dramatic duet, then I have a crazy full-on aria where I have to murder a rat, and by the final act I’m doing my best Wagnerian dramatic soprano interpretation, high and loud,” Fagan says. Much of Ticciati and the music team’s work these past two years has been detail-focused as they sought to create the Ur-score. “We’re sharpening, chamfering, varnishing everything to make it have the wings so that it can fly,” Ticciati says. Smyth never even got to hear her opera as she had first written it. “At the same time as thinking: ‘What did Ethel want?’, we’ve also been asking ourselves: ‘What can we do to make this piece live at its best?’” For everyone involved, the freedom of not having previous recordings or productions to refer to is exhilarating – and scary. “Actually that’s made me a bit nervy … that every person who comes to see this will never have heard it in this way,” says Lloyd-Roberts. “That gives us a different kind of responsibility and obviously we want this opera to be a huge success.” “I hope it’s a beautiful assault on our senses – and on our expectations,” Still says. Ticciati is confident the drama and power of the music will speak for itself. “I hope that it’s going to be tidal and it’s going to hit audiences in the face – whhhooomph!”  ​​The Wreckers is at Glyndebourne festival from 21 May to 24 June, and at the BBC Proms on 24 July.

5/20/2022,"Seth Meyers celebrated the defeat of Trump loyalist Madison Cawthorn in the North Carolina Republican primaries on Tuesday, which will end the 26-year-old freshman congressman’s scandal-ridden term in office. “Oh Madison, you may be gone but soon you’ll be forgotten,” the Late Night host said. “At least now he’ll have more time for his other jobs – starring as, I don’t know, the bad boy villain in a CW drama?” Cawthorn, once seen as a rising star within the party, faced an aggressive opposition campaign waged by fellow Republicans disgruntled with his antics – calling the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a “thug”, for example, as well as accusations of insider trading. “I will say, it’s a rare treat to watch Republicans tear each other apart, because when Republicans decide to knife each other, they hold nothing back,” Meyers said. “Democrats just snipe at each other on cable news about who’s responsible for their poll numbers.” “They’re like the Wasp-y Connecticut family that just passive aggressively bickers at the dinner table and then goes to bed full of quiet resentment,” he continued. “Going from that to Republican infighting is like when you date someone whose family is Italian and you go over to their house for dinner and they’re just chucking plates of spaghetti across the room.” The last straw for many in the GOP was when, in a podcast interview in March, Cawthorn claimed to have been invited to cocaine-fueled sex parties by fellow Republicans. “Normally I would’ve dismissed that all as ridiculous, except the GOP freaked out,” said Meyers. Nevertheless, Cawthorn still received support from Donald Trump, who posted “let’s give Madison a second chance” on Truth Social before the primary. “‘Let’s give Madison a second chance’ sounds like something you’d hear at a sorority after a pledge barfs all over the rug,” Meyers joked. “Cawthorn’s loss proves that the GOP establishment, if it wanted to, could easily ostracize its most toxic members,” Meyers concluded. “It just chooses not to. It has actively chosen to collude with Trump and his ilk, no matter how dangerous they are to democracy, because they think that’s the path to power.” And on the Late Show, Stephen Colbert recapped the results of Tuesday’s primaries in several important states. “The results are in,” he said, “and America has upheld its proud tradition of not knowing who won,” at least in one of the most closely watched races, the GOP Senate primary in Pennsylvania. As of taping, the race was too close to call, with Mehmet Oz at 31.3% of the vote and Dave McCormick at 31.1%. “Wow, that’s a nail biter. That is stressful. And there is no better cure for stress than Dr Oz’s Raspberry Ketone & Green Coffee Bean Protein Pancake Mix,” Colbert joked, referencing the TV doctor’s long history of dubious pseudo-scientific claims. Pennsylvania law requires a recount when the margin is half a percentage point or less, “but one Dr Oz supporter sees a way around that”, Colbert noted. That would be Donald Trump, who posted on Wednesday: “Dr Oz should declare victory. It makes it much harder for them to cheat with the ballots that they ‘just happened to find’.” “Well, I will give him this: he is an authority on cheating. Just ask all of his wives,” Colbert quipped. The host also celebrated the loss of Madison Cawthorn, who ostracized himself from the GOP when he told a podcast that he was frustrated by cocaine use in Washington: “Some of the people that are leading on the movement to try and remove addiction in our country and then you watch them do a key bump of cocaine in front of you,” he said. “OK, that’s an obvious lie,” Colbert said. “If members of Congress were on cocaine, they would get a lot more done.”",Arts/Culture,Seth Meyers on Madison Cawthorn’s loss: ‘A rare treat to watch Republicans tear each other apart’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/may/19/seth-meyers-madison-cawthorn-dr-oz-republican-primaries
5/20/2022,"The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, shares her Netflix account with four other households, including her mother’s, she has told MPs, calling the streaming service an “incredibly generous system”. Dorries argued that the recent share price collapse at Netflix, which is now worth less than a third of its market value at the start of the year, was evidence only of its success. “I think that [for] people to even try and paint a picture that Netflix … is struggling is slightly over-egging the pudding. But they are going to have to revise their business model,” she told the Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee. “I’ve always thought it’s [an] incredibly generous system that it has, if you have an account, of allowing other people access. I mean, my mum has access to my account, my kids do. I have Netflix, but there are four other people who can use my Netflix account in different parts of the country.” Dorries was then apparently told by Sarah Healey, the department’s permanent secretary, that password sharing was not allowed on the service. Dorries said the broader collapse in tech stocks made the case for privatising Channel 4 stronger, not weaker. The broadcaster needed to accept the sale was inevitable and that the proposed alternatives were not acceptable. “It’s time to wake up and smell the coffee: Channel 4 is being sold, subject to a vote. I did spend my entire Easter recess reassuring myself that we are in a position where this will happen. And it is very much a case that it is being sold. “The arguments for not selling it – the reasons for not selling it – we have been through hoops discussing and analysing those reasons. But the fundamental points don’t change, the arguments don’t change: it is owned by the government, and any borrowings or investment stand against the government’s balance sheet.” She said the government would keep the public service remit for a privatised channel 4 for the next 10 years, but after that it was up to the channel’s new owners to decide what they wanted to do with it – which could include ditching the channel’s news coverage. “I’m not going to justify a news programme whose news anchor went out shouting obscenities about the Conservative party,” she said. “So, you know, they don’t do themselves any favours sometimes, the news programme.” Dorries also accused Channel 4 of hiring paid actors for a TV show, Tower Block of Commons, that she appeared in as a new MP. The show, in which Dorries was sent to live in South Acton estate in west London, sparked a minor scandal when the MP was revealed to have smuggled in a £50 note, which she claimed was intended to buy gifts for the children of her hosts. Now, she said, she believed the hosts were planted by the show’s producers. “I discovered later, they were actually actors,” she told MPs. “The parents of the boys in that programme actually came here to have lunch with me, and contacted me to tell me, actually, they were in acting school, and that they weren’t really living in a flat, and they weren’t real. And even, if you remember, there’s a pharmacist or somebody that I went to see who prepared food – she was also a paid actress as well.” Channel 4 did not reply to a request for comment.",News/Politics,Nadine Dorries admits sharing Netflix account with relatives,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/19/nadine-dorries-admits-sharing-netflix-account-with-relatives
5/20/2022,"Who doesn’t like a bath scrub? Dolphins definitely do: they are known for being clever, playful, tactile animals, and they like to rub against rough surfaces, nap in coral beds and soak on sponges like guests at an underwater spa. However, dolphins may be getting more from their bath scrubs than just relaxation and leisure. A study published today suggests that bottlenose dolphins may be self-medicating their skin ailments with the help of corals, adding to growing research on their previously unexplored medicinal properties. “It’s very intensive,” said Angela Ziltener, one of the study’s lead authors, of the behaviour of the dolphins with particular corals. “They don’t just go through [the coral] – they go up, they come back down again and they rub their belly, their ventral area and the back.” Dolphins have thick, smooth and resilient skin, but can be prone to skin conditions such as yeast and bacterial infections, scars or tattoo-like lesions caused by viral pox infections. These ailments seem to be exacerbated by global heating. Ziltener, a wildlife biologist at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, and her team have been surveying a community of 360 Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) in the northern Red Sea since 2009. They observed that the dolphins often queued up nose-to-tail to rub themselves against corals as soon as they woke up and right before they went to sleep, as if they were showering for the day. As well as a mechanical rub, the dolphins also caused the corals to release a polyp mucus. The team also noticed that the dolphins returned to the same coral species, and appeared to be meticulous in choosing which parts of their body to rub. They ran lab tests on 48 samples of corals, sponges and coral mucus “chosen” by the dolphins, including the gorgonian coral Rumphella aggregata, the leather coral Sarcophyton sp. and the sponge Ircinia sp. The results, published in the journal iScience, revealed at least 17 different bioactive metabolites with antibacterial, antioxidative and oestrogen-like hormonal properties, all of which could be useful in skin treatments. The compounds are not commonly used in antibiotics for humans or animals, but an expanding body of research shows that some corals and sponges have medicinal properties, including antimicrobial. “Such metabolites are helpful if you have an infection,” said Gertrud Morlock, an analytical chemist at Justus Liebig University Giessen in Germany, and a lead author of the study. “If the dolphins have a skin infection, these compounds could have something like a healing property. “If you think about it, they have no other options. If they have a problem with the skin, what can they do?” The authors note that further research is needed to show which coral’s medicinal properties the dolphins need to treat given ailments, and whether these properties have a measurable, positive impact on the cetaceans’ health. Learning more about the dolphin’s social network and demographic could help with this. Tracking individual dolphins that display the behaviour, and seeing if they have fewer skin diseases or decreased mortality compared with the rest of the group, would make this argument stronger, according to Sarah Powell, a former marine biologist who studies how dolphins transmit their skin diseases but was not involved in the study. Past research has shown that dolphins like to use coral sponges as foraging tools. “I do not find it to be such a reach that dolphins would utilise corals and other plants in their environment for other purposes,” said Powell. Stephanie Venn-Watson, a marine biologist who studies health and longevity in dolphins and was also not involved in the research, said: “Since dolphins are inherently playful and tactile animals who love to rub, it is difficult to be sure that the dolphins are using the corals for medicinal purposes.” A next step in proving the link would be to show that corals ignored by dolphins lack the same medicinal properties, she said. “This is a nice science-driven itch to be scratched.”",News/Environment,Pharmacy in the sea: Dolphins ‘use coral as medicine for skin ailments’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/19/pharmacy-in-the-sea-dolphins-use-coral-as-medicine-for-skin-ailments

The good news for FLE is that they will be mathematically safe if they beat Crystal Palace at Goodison Park on Thursday. The bad news is that, if they don’t, they will have to get something away to Arsenal on the final day to guarantee safety. “Away” is the operative word: Everton have taken only 10 points on the road all season.

5/20/2022,"Starbucks has fired over 20 union leaders around the US over the past several months as union organizing campaigns have spread across the country, the Guardian can reveal. The news comes as Starbucks workers have filed petitions for union elections at more than 250 stores, spanning 35 states in the US. Starbucks’ chief executive, Howard Schultz, has led a campaign against the union movement calling it “some outside force that’s going to dictate or disrupt who we are and what we do”. The US’s top labor regulator, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), has issued complaints against Starbucks over many of the firings, demanding reinstatement and backpay for seven fired workers in Memphis, Tennessee, three fired workers in Overland, Kansas, six fired workers in Buffalo, New York, and three fired workers in Arizona. These cases will go before an administrative law judge unless a settlement is reached before those hearings. The NLRB has accused Starbucks of more than 200 violations of federal labor laws over the course of union organizing campaigns since late 2021. NLRB regional offices have issued complaints in regards to 45 cases against Starbucks, according to the NLRB. Starbucks also incited more legal concerns over recently announcing the rollout of new benefits for all employees, but exempting workers at unionized stores. Workers at several Starbucks stores have held strikes in protest of the company’s behavior toward union organizing. Laila Dalton, a shift supervisor at Starbucks for about three years in Phoenix, Arizona, was fired the day before her store’s union election ballots were being sent out. Dalton said she started getting write-ups for minor infractions and was interrogated and intimidated by management shortly after her store went public with its intent to unionize. Dalton filed an unfair labor practice charge with the NLRB before her firing over harassment from management. “I filed a complaint, an unfair labor practice charge, and that’s when it kind of all started,” said Dalton. She was fired on 4 April and has since been included in the NLRB complaint calling for reinstatement for her and two co-workers. “It was the day before the ballots were sent out. It was in front of people I’ve never met before and it was an hour into Howard Schultz being in office and his town hall speech,” added Dalton. “I still can’t believe they fired me since I already had a complaint against them.” Union organizers at Starbucks have also been fired in Wisconsin, North Carolina, Louisiana and Rochester, New York. Ashlee Feldman, a shift supervisor at a Starbucks store in St Louis, Missouri, for three years, was fired a few days before her store’s union election ballots were to be mailed out. Feldman said she was fired after she closed the dining area of her Starbucks store to drive-thru only temporarily due to short staffing. “I believe I was fired for being a shift supervisor who was pro-union,” said Feldman. “I’ve been with Starbucks almost three years and have never had any issues.” She is in the process of filing an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board to get reinstated. “I’m shocked at this firing and all I can think about is my eight-year-old autistic son who needs therapy and care that costs money,” added Feldman. “These higher-ups don’t care about us. They aren’t in the stores busting ass like we are. They don’t connect with the customers like we do.” In regard to Feldman’s termination, a Starbucks spokesperson said: “A partner’s interest in a union does not exempt them from the standards we have always held. Any claims of anti-union activity are categorically false.” According to the National Labor Relations Board, as of 13 May, 69 Starbucks stores have voted to form unions, nine stores voted against, and six union elections are still pending an outcome, based on challenged ballots.",News/Business,Revealed: Starbucks fired over 20 US union leaders in recent months,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/19/starbucks-fired-over-20-us-union-leaders
5/20/2022,"A battle is shaping up between major retailers over whether the UK should introduce an online sales tax, with Sainsbury’s demanding it to help revive struggling high streets while M&S argues it would have the opposite effect. A day before the government’s three-month consultation on changes to business taxes closes, the finance director of Sainsbury’s reiterated calls for an increase in taxes on digital retailers to fund a reduction on the business rates levied on physical stores. However, the finance head of Marks & Spencer, said an online sales tax would “punish” retailers that had worked hard to shift into modern ways of selling and leave them with less cash to invest in their high street estate. Kevin O’Byrne, the chief financial officer at Sainsbury’s, which owns Argos and Habitat as well as its supermarkets, said: “High business rates on shops is destroying high streets up and down the country. We urgently need fundamental business rates reform. “We urge the government to introduce an online sales tax that funds a reduction in business rates for retailers of all sizes and levels the playing field between physical and online retailers.” O’Byrne’s position contrasts with that of his counterpart at M&S, Eoin Tonge, who said: “Far from levelling up, an online sales tax would lock us down. It would make it even harder for the retailers the consultation is purportedly trying to help to invest in the digital transformation required to survive and grow in the modern, digital era. “The solution we need is practical, pragmatic reform of business rates and better taxing of global players to ensure everyone pays their fair share.” In a letter to the chancellor, excerpts of which were published by the BBC, Tonge said that putting an additional tax on retail, which he said was “already overburdened”, would “simply mean retailers cut their cloth accordingly”. “This rationalisation will always start with the least profitable parts of a business – which, in the case of multi-channel retailers, will more often than not be high street stores,” the letter said. M&S appears to be an outlier among retailers on the subject. Two weeks ago a “retail jobs alliance” of heavyweights in the sector, including Sainsbury’s and rival supermarket chains Tesco, Co-op and Morrisons, jointly called for an overall cut in business rates for all premises and said they were “open to the possibility” this could be funded through an online sales tax. The new group – which also included Greggs, Waterstones, B&Q-owner Kingfisher, the union Usdaw and the industry bodies representing independent retailers and convenience stores – said an online tax would help “level the playing field” between internet retailers and bricks-and-mortar stores at a time when Covid-19 has further shifted shopping habits online.

5/20/2022,"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has paused a new government board’s work on disinformation and accepted the resignation of its leader, capping weeks of argument about free speech rights in the US and a frenzy of conspiracy theories. Former disinformation governance board director Nina Jankowicz told the Associated Press hours after resigning on Wednesday that a wave of attacks and violent threats she has fielded since the board’s launch will not stop her from speaking out about disinformation campaigns pulsing through the social media feeds of Americans. “We need to have a grownup conversation about how to deal with threats to our national security and that’s not what happened here,” Jankowicz said. “I’m not going to be silenced.” What remains to be seen is how the board’s disastrous rollout and ensuing criticism around it will damage ongoing US efforts to counter disinformation used as a weapon by Russia and other adversaries. The homeland security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, acknowledged the board’s controversy had become a distraction to the department’s other work, which includes safeguarding US elections, two officials familiar with his decision said. While the board has not formally been closed down, it will be reviewed by members of a DHS advisory council that is expected to make recommendations in 75 days. The Washington Post first reported the board’s pause. Federal and state agencies treat disinformation as a national security threat. In a statement announcing its launch, DHS said the new initiative would coordinate efforts around threats of Russian disinformation campaigns aimed at the US and false claims that encourage migrants to travel to the US-Mexico border. The new board was hampered from the start by questions about its purpose, funding and work that Mayorkas struggled to answer even as he appeared in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill earlier this month. Mayorkas made the decision to pause the board after the negative reaction and growing concerns that it was hindering DHS’s other work on disinformation, according to two department officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. “The board has been grossly and intentionally mischaracterized: it was never about censorship or policing speech in any manner,” the department said in a statement. “It was designed to ensure we fulfill our mission to protect the homeland, while protecting core constitutional rights.” The White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, noted the board had never met and neither the department nor Jankowicz had any power to censor or remove content labeled as disinformation. DHS officials had tried to quell concerns about how the board would affect issues of free speech and online privacy by describing it as an internal working group intended to study definitions of disinformation across the department. But opponents have attacked the board’s work and purpose. The top Republicans on the House intelligence and homeland security committees issued a joint statement on Wednesday calling the board “a political tool to be wielded by the party in control”. “This board was only successful in reinforcing that the Department of Homeland Security’s priorities are severely misplaced,” wrote Representatives Mike Turner of Ohio and John Katko of New York, who previously said DHS had not disclosed information to them about the program. Senator Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican, told Mayorkas the board was a “terrible idea” that “communicates to the world that we’re going to be spreading propaganda in our own country”. Twenty Republican attorneys general, led by Jason Miyares of Virginia, threatened Mayorkas with legal action over the board “unless you turn back now and disband this Orwellian Disinformation Governance Board immediately”, Miyares said in a statement. Reception online and across conservative television shows to the board was even worse. The phrase “Ministry of Truth” – a reference to George Orwell’s 1984 – trended on Twitter in discussions about the board. Conservative pundits and social media users pushed conspiracy theories and falsehoods around its purpose, with some falsely claiming the board was quickly developed by DHS in response to billionaire Elon Musk’s quest to buy Twitter. Others put out patently false claims that Jankowicz planned to edit the tweets of everyday Twitter users. “It’s been really mischaracterized from the beginning,” said Cindy Otis, a disinformation researcher and former CIA analyst. Experts on disinformation warned the controversy around the board could hurt existing efforts to identify and stop the spread of false narratives about elections and hot-button issues in American society. Russia has tried to influence the last two presidential elections by boosting false stories and using social media to inflame divisions in American society on issues like race and the coronavirus pandemic. It has continued to spread false and misleading narratives about its invasion of Ukraine. US intelligence officials have also accused China and Iran of peddling disinformation to Americans. DHS has several programs to counter disinformation, including the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s efforts to debunk claims of election fraud. But, Otis warned: “It would be really unfortunate if they just decided that disinformation is too publicly sensitive of an issue.” Jankowicz, too, became the center of sexist and antisemitic attacks, and even death threats online. Jankowicz said on Wednesday that she was reporting violent threats that came in daily through phone calls, emails or Twitter messages. “It was horrible. It was constant,” she said. “That’s obviously really scary and really unpleasant. I was trying to do important work to protect Americans from a real threat.”",News/US news,US homeland security pauses new disinformation board amid criticism,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/19/homeland-security-disinformation-board-nina-jankowicz-resigns
5/20/2022,"An umbrella created as part of a collaboration between Gucci and Adidas has met with a storm of criticism in China, where social media users have derided its inability to keep its owner dry. Chinese consumers are calling out the fact that the item, priced at 11,000 yuan (£1,311) and not yet available, does not perform the basic function a user might expect. Called a “sun umbrella” on Gucci’s website, the piece from the upcoming Adidas x Gucci collection comes with a warning that it is “not waterproof and is meant for sun protection or decorative use”. The accessory has been mocked on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, with the BBC reporting that one user called it “a very big but useless fashion statement”, while another wrote: “As long as I’m poor, they won’t be able to trick me into paying for this.” Twitter has seen its share of scorn too. “Imagine buying a $1,600 umbrella as a status symbol, discovering it doesn’t stop rain, then finding out it was never intended to work in the first place,” tweeted one user. In comments to Beijing magazine Caijing, Gucci said the item was “not recommended for use as an everyday umbrella” and it has “good collector’s value and is suitable for use as a daily accessory”. There clearly remains a market for an item that is less about practicality and more about making a fashion statement. On Gucci’s UK website, there is a waiting list for the umbrella, where it is priced at a slightly cheaper £870. Gucci continues to be a superstar of the high-end fashion industry. This week, the brand staged a fashion show in a 13th-century castle in Puglia, southern Italy, flying in editors and influencers from all over the world for an event designed to align the showcase of its collection with the lunar eclipse. Until recently, it has been a success in China, which is forecast to be the biggest market for luxury goods by 2025. Analysts Daxue Consulting judge Gucci to be the fourth most popular luxury brand in the country, after Chanel, Dior and Hermès. The Chinese market has been key to Gucci’s exponential growth since Alessandro Michele became the creative director in 2015. Lockdowns in China over the past few months, as part of the country’s stringent anti-Covid measures, have directly affected sales figures during the first quarter of 2022. In April, it revealed its sales had risen by 13% as opposed to the 19% predicted by analysts, and the share price of parent company Kering subsequently fell.",Lifestyle/Fashion,"Gucci £1,300 umbrella ridiculed in China for not being waterproof",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/19/gucci-adidas-umbrella-mocked-in-china-as-not-waterproof
