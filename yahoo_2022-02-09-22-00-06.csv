2/9/2022,"Elon Musk's SpaceX said it lost up to 40 of the 49 Starlink satellites that it launched Thursday. A geomagnetic storm Friday prevented the satellites from reaching their orbital position. The satellites will burn up in the Earth's atmosphere but won't produce orbital debris, SpaceX said. Elon Musk's SpaceX said it has lost up to 40 Starlink satellites that it launched into orbit last week because of a geomagnetic storm. The aerospace company sent 49 Starlink satellites into low Earth orbit on Thursday via a Falcon 9 rocket. Around 80% of those satellites were ""significantly impacted"" by a geomagnetic storm Friday, SpaceX announced in a statement Tuesday. Geomagnetic storms are triggered by disturbances between the Earth's magnetic field and charged particles from the sun, known as solar wind, according to the Space Weather Prediction Center. The speed and intensity of the storm caused the ""atmospheric drag"" to climb to levels 50% higher than previous launches, SpaceX said in the statement, making it harder for satellites to reach their orbital position. SpaceX said that Starlink tried to fly the satellites in ""safe-mode"" to reduce atmospheric drag but they still weren't able to reach their intended destination. Up to 40 of the satellites will reenter the Earth's atmosphere and burn up, with some already having done so, Musk's firm said. SpaceX said in the statement that the affected satellites won't collide with other satellites as they deorbit. There won't be any orbital debris, nor will any satellite parts hit Earth, SpaceX added. SpaceX has launched more than 2,000 Starlink satellites into orbit, out of which nearly 1,900 are functioning. Harvard astronomer Jonathan McDowell said in a Twitter post Tuesday that there had been a noticeable lack of updates on the most recent cluster of Starlink satellites before SpaceX eventually announced details of the problem. In response to a Twitter user who asked if there had been similar incidents in the past, McDowell said, ""Not that I can recall.""

2/9/2022,"Porn actor Stormy Daniels said she is “far more angrier” with her former lawyer Michael Avenatti than with ex-President Donald Trump, with whom she said she had an affair that she was paid to keep secret. Last week, Avenatti was found guilty of cheating Daniels out of nearly $300,000 that she’d been advanced to write a book about her alleged affair with Trump. Daniels tore into Avenatti in an interview Tuesday with NewsNation’s Dan Abrams, mocking her former lawyer with a reference to her relationship with Trump. “He doesn’t scare me. I’ve seen Donald Trump naked. Nothing Michael Avenatti can say will scare me,” Daniels cracked. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, said Avenatti ― who put her on the stand for several hours during his trial ― had personally betrayed her. “I only met Trump a handful of times, not even. I didn’t consider him to be a friend,” she said. “I didn’t have private conversations, I didn’t trust him, and he certainly didn’t steal from me.” “Michael Avenatti betrayed my trust in every way possible. He lied to my face. He lied about me,” she added. Watch the interview here: This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

2/9/2022,"MSNBC political analyst Neal Katyal, who served as acting solicitor general in the Obama White House, on Tuesday branded the Republican National Committee with a new nickname. Katyal, appearing on “The Last Word,” repurposed the acronym RNC to mean “Republican National Conspiracy” as he slammed GOPers seeking to whitewash, downplay and cover up the deadly U.S. Capitol riot. Katyal also mocked former President Donald Trump’s reported pattern of destroying documents, in violation of the Presidential Records Act. “I suppose Trump has had stressful work experiences,” Katyal told anchor Lawrence O’Donnell, likening Trump to a “toddler.” “It must have been frustrating for him to stroll into the White House at 3 p.m. on any given day and find somebody covered his desk with more of that paper with the strange squiggles on it,” he added. “But, you know, you can’t tear it up.” This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

2/9/2022,"An alleged shoplifter was caught on video making his way out of a New York City Trader’s Joe carrying a stack of stolen steaks that looked like it could feed a football team’s offensive line, according to a report. The New York Post obtained video of the alleged theft on Tuesday morning at the supermarket’s East 14th Street location. The paper said ""two helpless Trader Joe’s staffers had followed the man up an escalator leading to the store’s exit but only stopped him from taking a shopping basket outside—not the meat, the video shows."" The NYPD told Fox News that the incident is under investigation and there have been no arrests as of Wednesday morning. Police said they were called and responded to the store at 8:40 a.m. A worker there told the paper that they are discouraged from trying to stop shoplifters. ""It don’t bother me,"" the worker told the paper. ""I’ve been working here for two years, I see it happen every day. After a while, you just don’t care."" The video was similar to the one posted by actor Michael Rapaport last month that he said showed a shoplifter casually walking out of a New York City Rite Aid after filling up a few bags. ""This f–---g guy just filled his two bags up with everything in Rite Aid, right here on 80th [Street] and First Avenue, is walking down the street like s--t is Gucci. Looking me in my face like, ‘what’s good?' I was watching him the whole time,"" he added. GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trader Joe’s did not immediately respond to an after-hours email from Fox News.
