12/13/2021,"A third of UK small businesses are planning to make staff redundant over the next few months, rising to more than four in 10 in London, according to a new survey. In a clear sign of the financial stress felt by many owner-run businesses as they head into a potentially difficult new year period, many also said they would be forced to raise prices, with Britain’s supply chain meltdown being cited as the main reason – adding further to inflationary pressures.  The poll of 442 businesses found many were struggling with repaying the debts they racked up to get them through the pandemic as well as grappling with other challenges from supply chain disruption to shortages of key staff such as drivers and chefs, and high energy costs. A separate study by the accountants EY, which reveals a clear divide between the winners and losers in the pandemic, found that thousands of firms, mostly major corporate entities, paid down existing debt far faster than predicted in 2021. It said UK businesses would repay £1.6bn over 2021 after borrowing £35bn in 2020, an amount driven by firms that have fared well over the past 20 months. Recently introduced rules relating to the new Omicron variant, which have dealt a blow to many city centre outlets reliant on commuters and made life harder for hospitality businesses such as nightclubs, coupled with the end of the furlough scheme in September, could turn the screw further on many small firms. Accountancy firm Moore UK said its latest quarterly survey of owner-managed businesses found that 33% were planning to make redundancies over the next six months now that the safety net of furlough had been removed. Businesses in London were more likely than those in any other part of the UK to be planning redundancies, with 42% considering laying off staff. This is likely to reflect the effects of the pandemic on the finances of the hospitality sector – restaurants, pubs, hotels and so on – which makes up a significant part of the capital’s economy. Those UK small businesses planning to make redundancies were, on average, considering shedding 45% of their staff over the next six months. Maureen Penfold, the chair of Moore UK, said that while a wave of redundancies did not materialise when the furlough scheme ended, many businesses were now waiting to see whether layoffs became necessary over the coming months. “It’s surprising to see so many businesses are considering reducing staffing numbers so substantially. Policymakers should be careful not to assume that the economy is back in rude health – especially taking into account how the new restrictions just implemented may further impact businesses,” she added. They survey also shows that 49% of those questioned said they expected to have to increase the prices they charged over the next six months. The majority cited disruption to their supply chains as the main reason. “Price increases are the only response they have,” said Penfold. About 38% of businesses said increased staffing costs were the main contributor to them looking to increase prices. Some firms, including a number of restaurants and clubs, have said they are being forced to offer hefty sign-on bonuses of £1,000 or more to attract key staff as shortages intensify.",News/Business,"One in three UK small firms plan major staff cuts, survey reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/13/one-in-three-uk-small-firms-plan-major-staff-cuts-survey-reveals
12/13/2021,"The UK’s housing market is likely to return to more normal levels of activity in 2022 but will still be busy, with strong buyer demand carrying forward into next year and a rebound in the number of homeowners apparently getting ready to sell, according to Rightmove. The property website said that following a “frenzied” 18 months, the market was heading for a “less frenetic” period, with a more even balance between buyers and sellers as more homes are put up for sale and higher interest rates take some of the heat out of buyer demand.  It said one sign of a return to more traditional conditions was its finding that the market had experienced its usual “December dip”, with the average asking price of a home falling by 0.7% – or £2,234 – over the past month. However, this UK-wide figure disguises regional variations: in London and Scotland typical asking prices have fallen by more than that – by 1.6% and 3.5% respectively – but in other regions such as the East and West Midlands, they rose by up to 1.6% over the past month. Separately, UK Finance, the bank trade body, said a strong year for sales would make 2021 a record year for mortgage lending. It predicted that gross mortgage lending would peak this year at £316bn – up 31% on 2020 – then fall back to £281bn in 2022 before increasing to £313bn in 2023. However, it added that mortgage arrears were expected to be 26% higher in 2022 than this year, hitting 102,000, compared with an estimated 80,800 in 2021, while home repossessions were forecast to climb by 267% to reach 7,700 in 2022, compared with an estimated 2,100 this year. Its data follows a string of surveys that have depicted a property market that is continuing to defy many expert forecasts. Last week, the Halifax issued figures showing that average UK house prices rose by 3.4% in the three months to the end of November, the highest quarterly rate since late 2006. Rival lender Nationwide said prices continued to climb in November and were now 10% higher than a year earlier. Rightmove said it was predicting a “closer to normal” market during 2022, though that did not mean it believed the sector was heading for a dramatic slowdown: it has already predicted that house prices will rise by 5% next year on a national level. However, it believes that “some of the edge will be taken off sellers’ pricing power” by increasingly stretched buyer affordability and a better choice of properties for sale. The website, which claims to advertise 95% of all properties for sale, said requests from homeowners to estate agents to have their home valued were up 19% on this time a year ago. This suggested that “more people will be making a new year resolution to move”. It added that buyer demand and market momentum “remain strong going into 2022”, with November’s data showing buyer numbers up by 41% on 2019, and 3% up on 2020. Tim Bannister, Rightmove’s director of property data, said that an interest rate rise was likely next year, and that while a rate rise was often regarded as unhelpful to the market, “a slowing of the fast pace of sales, and associated pace of price rises, will help the return to more normality that will suit many movers”. The stamp duty holiday announced by the government in July 2020 has been credited with fuelling a boom in the property market and pushing up prices. Alongside the stamp duty holiday – which ended on 30 September in England and Northern Ireland – the market has also been boosted by a range of factors including government guarantees for mortgages and a pandemic-fuelled desire for a new lifestyle that has led many buyers to prioritise properties with bigger gardens and more room for working from home. Rightmove said the average asking price of a UK home was now £340,167 compared with £342,401 a month ago, with the annual rate of price growth unchanged at 6.3%.",News/Business,"UK housing market forecast for 2022?

12/13/2021,"This revival of John Kander and Fred Ebb’s 1966 musical might as well come with its own distinctive Kit Kat Club drumroll: one of the hottest – and more expensive – tickets of the year, its high concept staging extends across the venue, turning the foyers and the facade into the Weimar-era Berlin cabaret club in which its drama is set. There is also the drum-roll hype of Eddie Redmayne’s casting as the club’s impish Emcee. Appearing on a London stage for the first time in a decade, he has a long way to fall in a part whose songs, interspersed through the show, are central to its shifting tone, from the permissiveness and bonhomie of the late 1920s to the rise of the Third Reich.  But from the moment we are “Willkommened” by Redmayne, it is clear he is in control of his material and electric in his part. As the soiled soul of Berlin, Redmayne’s Emcee mirrors the movement from light to dark; he is a comically twisted Rumpelstiltskin at the start, uncoiling to a figure resembling a terrible evil fairy or angel of death by the end. There are several moments at which we catch our breath, one coming in “If You Could See Her” in which he pushes the comic absurdism of singing a soppy love song to a gorilla and then chills us with the last, antiSemitic line, spat out like snake venom rather than whispered like Joel Grey’s comic aside in the 1972 film. It does not matter that Redmayne’s voice is drowned out by the orchestra at times. He gives an immense, physicalised performance, both muscular and delicate, from his curled limbs to his tautly expressive fingertips. Rebecca Frecknall’s production on the whole lives up to its hype, magnetising us with flamboyant camp and then delivering menace that feels freshly charged. Jessie Buckley, as Sally Bowles, first emerges as a glassy-eyed, underage sex-bomb – an obscene Shirley Temple in a frou-frou dress. Buckley plays her as the opposite of Liza Minnelli’s fun-loving chanteuse. Here she is a plummy-voiced Sloane who is emphatically unsexy with an edge of severity. But she sings with astonishing command, and there is an especially breath-taking version of “Cabaret” which is full of zombie-like darkness that sucks all of Minnelli’s froth out of it. Omari Douglas brings a gentle sweetness to his part as the bisexual American novelist, Clifford Bradshaw, but seems hemmed in by the role, as muted as his beige suit, though there is one flaring moment of passion when he kisses another man. Together, they do not spark romantic chemistry as the central couple. Their scenes together feel static and are side-lined by the passion of the show’s older couple: the boarding house landlady, Fraulein Schneider (Liza Sadovy), and the Jewish grocer, Herr Schultz. They become this production’s heart, first surprised to have found love so late and then broken when Nazi fervour drives them apart. “What Would You Do?” sings the Fraulein, and we feel her caught between the immovable forces of fascism, survival, and love. Together, they are magnificently tender and tragic. Tom Scutt’s stage design is expressionistic and imaginative: a train journey is represented by a model train revolving around the outer part of the three-tiered, circular stage. “Tomorrow Belongs to Me” has miniature model men standing to attention on the revolve, replaced by real men in its reprise, which is infused with ominous, stomping movements and a martial drum beat, prefiguring the terror to come. The auditorium is re-arranged with tables and chairs which creates the intimacy of a cabaret club, accompanied by Isabella Byrd’s cleanly sensational spot-lighting. Some of the early scenes seem like discrete warm-up acts, filled with romp, burlesque and transgressive naughtiness. The minor characters are beautifully realised too: Cliff’s friend, Ernst (Stewart Clarke), never loses his affability even after he reveals himself a Nazi. The Kit Kat Club’s dancers are by turns vulgar, comical and sexy with a thrilling blend of genders, and the musical comedy tickles with cartoonish charm, especially as Fraulein Kost (Anna-Jane Casey) smuggles her night trade of sailors into the boarding house. “Two Ladies” looks like a hazy theatrical wet dream, staged amid an orgy of tangled bodies – one character masturbates to Mein Kampf and another makes luridly suggestive moves on a sink plunger. Occasionally, it verges on outre overload. In the far shorter and overly sinister second half, Julia Cheng’s sinewy and soaring choreography is key to the tip from hedonism to hate: high-kicks start to resemble goose-steps and street violence is conveyed in a dance of outstretched limbs and a jacket balled in the fists of the performers. Redmayne creeps around the fringes of the stage when he is not performing, watching scenes from afar. If this show is sold on his star turn, we get more than our money’s worth with his blinding performance – in this blinder of a show. Cabaret is at the Playhouse theatre, London, until 1 October 2022.",Arts/Stage,Cabaret review – Eddie Redmayne is electric in this blinder of a show,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/dec/13/cabaret-review-eddie-redmayne-playhouse-theatre
12/13/2021,"Like many modern idioms, the phenomenon of “being in the hot seat” carries a diverse, and not altogether pleasant, etymology. Modern usage of the phrase, though, holds a more benign meaning: to indicate that an individual or entity is the subject of intense scrutiny for poor performance. Or to provide a real-world example, the current position of Western Sydney’s Carl Robinson. The Wanderers coach and his players were booed by their own supporters following 2-0 defeat to Macarthur FC on Saturday, after Robinson was snookered by the rope-a-dope tactics of counterpart Ante Miličić that afforded the hosts two-thirds of the ball in anticipation that the opposition would be devoid of inspiration in the final third.  It came after a mid-week defeat to semi-professional and out-of-season NPL NSW side APIA Leichhardt that put the Wanderers out of the FFA Cup. Robinson, just days after declaring it a fixture “we’ve got to take seriously” and discounting “wholesale changes” sent out a lethargic, second-string side and was promptly made to pay for what was either a deliberate strategy of load management – ostensibly for the Macarthur game – or hubris. If there was any doubt beforehand, smoke is now billowing from beneath his perch in the dugout. “Supporters have got every right to be disappointed. I’m disappointed, the players are disappointed,” Robinson said after Saturday’s loss. “Don’t blame the players, if you want to blame anyone, blame me. I am thick-skinned enough to do that. I understand football is a results-driven business.” Given the apoplectic mood amongst the Wanderers faithful (#RobinsonOut got a good workout across social media over the past week), it was the right thing to say in that situation. Australian football is not an environment that readily welcomes toxic blame-shifting à la José Mourinho – generally, excuses are given in a more subtle manner. But even if it was, the Welshman simply lacks a legacy of success that would afford him licence to go full scorched earth. Given that no ALM coach has been given stronger backing or a wider remit to recruit, taking aim at his players would also have effectively replaced one rod in his back for another – if the players aren’t good enough then that’s on him as well. That Robinson found the right tone should not be surprising though, given one of the defining characteristics since his arrival in Parramatta has been his ability to find the right words – He had instilled hope the club would ascend to become the biggest club in the land and, when reality bit, shifted the conversation elsewhere or forwards. The problem in Sydney’s west, though, is that this ability to dazzle off the pitch is in stark contrast to a continued inability to get things right on it – or even hint at an overarching approach that could eventually deliver the club to the promised land. Fourteen months into the latest attempt to find success in the post-Tony Popovic era, the Wanderers lack a discernible identity in their play and continue to be placed behind the eight-ball when their opposition makes the decision to simply let them have the ball. To provide some contrast, it has taken just four games for Arthur Papas to instil a clear – albeit madcap – direction at the Newcastle Jets. Despite having what on paper is possibly the strongest team in ALM, the Wanderers have looked second best in every game this season and the officiating in their lone win was of sufficient quality to reportedly earn the vanquished Wellington Phoenix an apology from Football Australia. Given the institutional advantages the club holds, it should be an unacceptable predicament. Admittedly, being on the hot-seat early on in the season doesn’t have to spell disaster. Patrick Kisnorbo cut a strained figure early on in 2020-21 only for Melbourne City to promptly find their feet and run away with the league. And until the axe falls, there is always a chance for a turnaround – and this squad is talented enough to compete. But when ambitious ownership meets an uncertain direction, things can also move quickly, as Marco Kurz found out after 11 games at Melbourne Victory in 2019-20. The issue that then arises, as Victory found out, is what comes next.",Sport/Football,Second-best Wanderers under the microscope after slow start to ALM season | Joey Lynch,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/13/second-best-wanderers-under-the-microscope-after-slow-start-to-alm-season
12/13/2021,"Thousands of Queenslanders will be finally enjoying dinner in their own homes on Monday after spending months trapped across the border in New South Wales. The border between the two states reopened just after midnight Queensland time.  Queensland’s police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, estimated that approximately 50,000 vehicles would be crossing in the early hours of Monday morning, with long delays expected. All vehicles were required to present a border pass that was only made available to those travelling from hotspots one hour before the border opened, leaving many already anxious travellers more worried about getting home. But, according to some who crossed as soon as they could, the process was seamless. Charlie Love of Mackay was one of the lucky ones. He crossed at Ducat Street, Tweed Heads and was back in Queensland in 30 minutes from start to finish. “The border checkpoint was so smooth, with about 100 vehicles and flowed really well,” he said. “Getting the pass was a piece of cake and took about 10 minutes max.” He and his partner travelled through to Glamorgan Vale to catch up on sleep and to pick up the dog they had not seen for three months since they travelled into NSW for his work. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But Alison Turnbull, who was trying to get to the Gold Coast, had a different experience on the M1. She and her husband have been visiting her sick mother and are now trying to get back to their ill daughter. They were among those who packed up their caravan early and spent Sunday in a roadside rest area waiting. She said about 1,000 people were at the Chinderah service station, just south of the border, before midnight, trying to get their passes sorted out on various iPads and devices. “People were upset and frantic at midnight trying to sort out the new pass in the dark, most getting denied,” she said in an SMS. “I got my husband done, then mine was not correct. It could have been so simple if [done] two days before.” She said it took her almost an hour to get her pass and people were begging her to help them with theirs. “Two ladies in their 70s were crying,” she said. “The distraught look on people’s faces, especially the alone or elderly, was terrible.” When they got to the border, Turnbull said the police wanted to see printed passes and about 30 cars were pulled over. “Took me two hours to get to police border zone at 1am and two seconds to go through,” she said. Paris and Daniel Hokin and their two boys are moving to Queensland from Newcastle and have been living in a campervan for three weeks. They were surprised at how little traffic was on the road when they arrived at the border at 1.30am but were turned back because their Covid test results had not yet come back, 40 hours after they were tested in Grafton. They called NSW Health and were told there was “a massive backlog”. “I was banking on the traffic so we’d have a bit more time for our test result to come through,” Daniel Hokin said. “NSW Health knew that this was going to be a huge influx of tests when this border was going to open. Why wasn’t it more manned? Even at the Covid testing we went to at Grafton, it had two people and a girl who fainted and everything. It was crazy.” At Murwillumbah showground on Sunday afternoon, its caretaker, Greg Fallon, was preparing to farewell some of his guests who were planning to hit the road first thing. Since July when the border closed, he and the community have been supporting displaced Queenslanders financially, emotionally and with food and donations. Fallon said it had been “very, very hard” to see people so distressed but it had also been extremely uplifting to see the kindness displayed by others. “They’re semi-excited to be going across the border but there’s a lot of fear that it’s all going to change,” he said. “There’s a huge amount of distrust in the government and that’s creating its own frustrations. There’s a huge amount of misinformation that is coming from the government … We’ve had people here in tears. “They’re happy to be going home but they’re filled with trepidation about what’s going to happen and depending on who answers the hotline, they get a different story every time. “All you can really do is … well, they all need a hug and a pat on the shoulder and for us to say, ‘Well, we’ll get you through’, and that’s what we’ve done here. Tonight we’re putting on a party for all of those who are leaving to celebrate the fact they’re crossing the border.” With Christmas holidays approaching, opening the border signals good news for tourism and hospitality operators who have struggled. “We’re relieved and overjoyed,” said Bradley Nardi, general manager of the Tweed Tourism Company. “It’s a really important step in connecting this community. We need to get this border right so visitors have confidence and aren’t going to spend all day in a car.”",News/Australia news,Qld border reopening: thousands of stranded travellers make way to sunshine state ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/13/qld-border-reopening-thousands-of-stranded-travellers-make-way-to-sunshine-state
12/13/2021,"New Zealand health authorities are investigating claims that a man received up to 10 Covid-19 vaccination doses in one day on behalf of other people, in the latest effort by members of the public to skirt tough restrictions on the unvaccinated. The Ministry of Health said it was taking the matter seriously. “We are very concerned about this situation and are working with the appropriate agencies,” its Covid-19 vaccination and immunisation spokesperson, Astrid Koornneef, said.  Stuff reports the man is believed to have visited several immunisation centres and was paid to get the doses. In New Zealand vaccines can either be booked through a website, via a doctor, or people can turn up to walk-in centres. To be administered a vaccine, a person must provide the health care worker with their name, date of birth and physical address, but no further identification is required. “To assume another person’s identity and receive a medical treatment is dangerous. This puts at risk the person who receives a vaccination under an assumed identify and the person whose health record will show they have been vaccinated when they have not,” Koornneef said. “This could affect how their health is managed in the future.” The ministry urged anyone who has had more vaccine doses than recommended to seek clinical advice. Vaccinologist Helen Petousis-Harris, from the University of Auckland, said there was no specific data on using the vaccine in this way, but the man was not likely to come to serious harm. “We know that higher doses result in more general vaccine reactions, like fever and headaches and pains, so you might anticipate he would feel pretty grotty the next day.” This case was not an isolated one, Petousis-Harris said, adding that she had heard of others being paid to receive the vaccine on someone else’s behalf. People are not required to show photo identification when getting the vaccine, in order to make the process as accessible as possible, but that makes the system vulnerable to abuse by “a small minority of people,” she said. “I think it is a very selfish act on the behalf of the buyer, and exploiting, perhaps, somebody who needed to get some money and is willing to take those risks, which is not very community minded.” New Zealand is expected to hit its 90% double vaccinated goal for the eligible population – 12 years and older – before Christmas. But a small and vocal cohort of people are reluctant to be immunised. The country’s new traffic light system, announced by prime minister Jacinda Ardern in late November, ends lockdowns in favour of restrictions on the unvaccinated. The red, orange and green levels depend on vaccination rates and the level of strain on the health system, but even at red – the strictest level – businesses are fully open to the vaccinated, with some restrictions on gathering size. Last week, Newshub filmed a licensed doctor handing out medical certificates as vaccine exemption certificates at her clinic and telling her patients she was not vaccinated. Proper medical exemptions can only be granted through the Ministry of Health, and medical professionals are required to be immunised. The police have confirmed they are investigating the incident.",News/World news,New Zealand authorities investigate claims man received 10 Covid vaccinations in one day,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/13/new-zealand-authorities-investigate-claims-man-received-10-covid-vaccinations-in-one-day
