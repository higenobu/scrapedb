12/14/2021,"Investors this week are set to focus on the Federal Reserve's final monetary policy decision of 2021, which may include more signaling of a monetary policy adjustment amid elevated inflation and a strengthening economic backdrop.  Members of the Federal Open Market Committee are set to hold their two-day policy-setting meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, after which they will release their monetary policy statement and hold a press conference with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The December statement will also be accompanied by an updated Summary of Economic Projections — the first since September — outlining members' expectations for economic conditions and interest rates over the next few years. Many economists now expect that this month's meeting will serve as the platform for Fed officials to increase the rate of tapering of their asset-purchase program. For more than a year-and-a-half during the pandemic, the Fed bought Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) at a clip of $120 billion per month, with this program comprising a key tool in supporting the virus-stricken economy. Last month, the Fed began winding down this program, slowing its purchases by $15 billion per month in each of November and December as the economy showed signs that it could continue to recover from the pandemic without the added monetary policy support.  ""We expect the Fed to announce a doubling in the pace of tapering at the December FOMC meeting, bringing the monthly drawdown to $20 billion and $10 billion per month for Treasuries and MBS, respectively. This would conclude the tapering process in March and open up greater optionality for an earlier liftoff,"" wrote Deutsche Bank economists led by Matthew Luzzetti in a note late last week.  Heading into next week's meeting, Fed officials have already struck a more hawkish tone and suggested a near-term acceleration to tapering could be coming. Powell told Congress late last month that the central bank would discuss at the December meeting ""whether it would be appropriate to wrap up our purchases a few months early,"" given the backdrop of ""an economy that is very strong and inflationary pressures that are very high."" Other officials have echoed these sentiments. And in the weeks since Powell delivered those remarks, inflationary pressures have only come in hotter. The November Consumer Price Index showed a 6.8% year-over-year rise in consumer prices last month — the fastest since 1982. And other data have underscored the tightness of the present labor market, suggesting employers might need to further raise wages — and in doing so contribute further to inflationary pressures — in order to compete for talent. Weekly jobless claims came in at the lowest since 1969 last week, while job openings came in above 11 million in the U.S. for only the second time ever recorded in October.  ""Strong economic growth, labor market recovery and elevated inflation has clearly moved the Fed toward an accelerated focus on shifting policy and particularly in getting quantitative easing over with,"" Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income and head of the BlackRock Global Allocation Investment Team, wrote in an email Friday. ""That said, the Fed will also have to balance these factors alongside potential Omicron risks, its supply and demand influences, potentially moderately slowing demand for goods and services and the possibility of rising geopolitical risks."" Still, other pundits pointed out that the Fed will need to be cautious about not coming off so hawkish at their next meeting that it spooks the markets, which have already been on edge about risks around inflation.  ""The Fed wants to jawbone this inflation a little bit lower here over the coming months,"" Christopher Vecchio, DailyFX.com senior strategist, told Yahoo Finance Live on Thursday. ""They also are cognizant of the fact that raising interest rates will not unclog the ports, it will not lead to any fixed capital investment increase to fix the infrastructure problems, if you will, that have been creating these supply chain problems. And so this is a tight walk here."" ""They really have to be careful about potentially tipping markets over by appearing too hawkish at the onset,"" he added. ""So I do think we're going to see strong forecasts on inflation, strong forecasts for growth. But ultimately, by the end of 2022, particularly 2023, those forecasts for inflation should be getting closer to the trend."" One key piece of economic data out this week will be November retail sales, offering a look at the strength of the consumer in the midst of the holiday shopping season.  Consensus economists are expecting to see retail sales rise by 0.8% in November compared to October, according to Bloomberg data. This would slow compared to October's 1.7% monthly increase, but still represent a fourth straight monthly increase.  ""The gain should be supported by holiday sales with clothing showing the biggest sequential gain among major sectors,"" Bank of America economist Michelle Meyer estimated in a note on Friday. ""That said, we do think the risks are skewed to the downside given the sizable upside surprise in October's sales.""  The bigger-than-expected rise in retail sales in October stemmed from strength in a variety of categories. Non-store retailers, or e-commerce platforms, posted a 4% sales increase, while gasoline station sales and electronics and appliance stores saw sales grow 3.9% and 3.8%, respectively. Some economists suggested the monthly jump likely stemmed from consumers doing their holiday shopping earlier this year to try and get ahead of supply chain disruptions and shipping delays.  Other private data on consumption for November came in strong, further suggesting another solid monthly rise in retail sales. Adobe Analytics said in an update published Nov. 30 that consumers had already spent $109.8 billion online between Nov. 1 to Nov. 29, with this figure growing 11.9%, compared to last year.  Monday: No notable reports scheduled for release Tuesday: NFIB Small Business Optimism, November (98.4 expected, 98.2 in October); Producer Price Index (PPI), month-over-month, November (0.5% expected, 0.6% in October); PPI excluding food and energy, month-over-month, November (0.4% expected, 0.4% in October); PPI year-over-year, November (9.2% expected, 8.6% in October); PPI excluding food and energy, year-over-year, November (6.8% expected, 6.8% in October) Wednesday: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Dec. 10 (2.0% during prior week); Retail sales excluding autos and gas, month-over-month, November (0.8% expected, 1.4% in October); Import price index, month-over-month, November (0.8% expected, 1.2% in October); Business Inventories, October (1.0% expected, 0.7% in September); NAHB Housing Market Index, December (84 expected, 83 in November); FOMC Rate Decision Thursday: Initial jobless claims, week ended Dec. 11 (199,000 expected, 184,000 during prior week); Continuing claims, week ended Dec. 4 (1.992 million during prior week); Housing starts, month-over-month, November (3.3% expected, -0.7% in October); Building permits, month-over-month, November (0.4% expected, 4.2% in October); Philadelphia Fed Business Outlook Index, December (30.0 expected, 39.0 in November); Industrial Production, month-over-month, November (0.7% expected, 1.6% in October); Capacity Utilization, November (76.8% expected, 76.4% in October); Manufacturing Production, November (0.7% expected, 1.2% in October); Markit U.S. Manufacturing PMI, December preliminary (58.5 expected, 58.3 in November); Markit U.S. Composite PMI, December preliminary (57.2 in November); Markit U.S. Services PMI, December preliminary (58.0 in November); Kansas City Federal Reserve Manufacturing Activity, December (24 in November) Friday: No notable reports scheduled for release Monday: No notable reports scheduled for release Tuesday: No notable reports scheduled for release Wednesday: Lennar (LEN) after market close Thursday: Adobe (ADBE) before market open; FedEx (FDX), Rivian (RIVN) after market close Friday: Darden Restaurants (DRI) before market open — Emily McCormick is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

12/14/2021,"Heading into year’s end, the Street’s professional analysts are busy putting together their predictive models, working to give investors an idea just where the markets are heading. All in all, it would seem to be a positive picture; despite some recent volatility, the markets are still following the sustained upward trend they’ve been on since the spring of last year. Writing from Oppenheimer, chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus leads the bulls. He sees gains of 13% in store for the S&P 500 index, predicting it will reach 5,330 by the end of next year. Stoltzfus acknowledges the headwinds – especially inflation. At a 6.8% annualized rate last month, the inflation rate is at a 40-year high. Stoltzfus sees bottlenecks in both the supply chains and the labor markets as the chief drivers of the rising prices. On the other hand, Stoltzfus believes that the Federal Reserve’s likely shift in policy – from easy money to higher interest rates – will provide a lifting effect, so long as the Fed doesn’t administer too strong a dose of this medicine. He’s optimistic, thought, saying, “We do not expect the Fed to slam on the brakes to choke off liquidity but rather look for it to 'pump the brakes' as lightly as it can as it takes the mechanisms of emergency stimulus off gradually.” We’ll hear from the Fed later this week. In the meantime, let's check in with Stoltzfus’ colleagues among Oppenheimer’s stock analysts, who see two stocks poised to make gains next year, bringing investors the returns on the order of 90% or better. After running the two through TipRanks' database, we found out that the rest of the Street is also standing squarely in the bull camp. ESS Tech (GWH) The first stock we’ll look at is ESS Tech, an emerging firm in an emerging sector – long duration energy storage. That may sound like batteries, and it is, but with a twist. ESS does not use traditional chemical batteries, which are prone to short life cycles, charge reduction problems, overheating, and fire hazards, and contain corrosive chemicals. Rather, the company is focused on iron flow batteries, using electron transfer from electrolyte liquids to store and release energy. The batteries have between 6 and 12 hours storage capacity before recharging – a big step up from current large-scale battery technology. Use of long duration batteries offers the promise of a greener future. Iron flow batteries, which avoid the environmentally dangerous chemical compounds of traditional batteries, add cleaner tech to that. The system’s advantages include 20,000 charging cycles, over 20 years operating life, and the ability to both stabilize the existing electrical grid and accelerate the use of renewable power sources. ESS is the first US long duration energy storage firm to trade on the pubic markets. The company entered the public markets through a SPAC transaction with ACON S2 Acquisition Corporation, a move that closed in October. The deal brought ESS some $308 million new capital, and the GWH ticker started trading on October 11. This newly public stock caught the attention of Oppenheimer’s 5-star analyst Colin Rusch, who writes: “We view GWH as leveraging its proprietary iron flow battery technology platform into structural cost and performance advantages for stationary storage applications. We believe long-duration energy storage has a crucial role to play in enabling the migration of the global economy toward a zero-emissions future and see ESS's solutions as providing critical power solutions with advantaged economics…. [We] see base unit cost and comparatively low incremental capacity costs, in addition to a lack of capacity fade, as enabling scalable unit economics.” In line with these upbeat comments, Rusch initiated coverage of the stock with an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating, and his $28 price target suggests it has room for ~90% upside over the next 12 months. (To watch Rusch’s track record, click here) The bulls are clearly out in force for this one, as the Strong Buy consensus rating is unanimous, based on 4 recent positive stock reviews. Shares are selling for $14.69 and the $25.50 average price target indicates room for ~74% appreciation from that level over the coming year. (See GWH stock analysis on TipRanks) Pliant Therapeutics (PLRX) Now let’s move over to the biotech research field, where Pliant Therapeutics is working on new treatments for fibrotic diseases. These are a wide class of disease conditions, affecting numerous organs of the body and characterized by scarring. Pliant is working with drug candidates that offer promise of halting the scarring and the disease progression, and thus maintaining organ function in patients. The company’s lead drug candidate, PLN-74809, is currently undergoing two clinical trials, each at Phase 2, for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). These are chronic, progressive conditions of the lungs and liver, respectively, leading to eventual loss of organ function and death. PLN-74809 has received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for both indications. The clinical trial on the IPF track has recently shown positive interim data, with clinically significant effects across several doses, and ‘greater than 50% target engagement.’ Also on the IPF track, a Phase 2a trial is on track to release topline data by the middle of next year. Turning to the PSC track, another Phase 2a trial is currently enrolling, and is expected to be completed by the end of next year. The company also has two preclinical studies approaching the stage of Investigational New Drug submission. These two studies are looking at novel treatments in the fields of oncology and muscular dystrophy. The active pipeline here has caught the eye of Oppenheimer’s Jeff Jones, who notes: “We see PLRX as an attractive opportunity to buy into a productive discovery and development platform targeting the integrin class of receptors. With lead candidate PLN-74809 in Phase 2 trials for two significantly underserved indications (IPF and PSC) and a clinical stage collaboration with Novartis we see a validated platform with significant upcoming clinical catalysts in 2022."" Jones uses that outlook to back his Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating and $40 price target on PLRX. Shares could appreciate ~158%, should the analyst’s thesis play out in the coming months. (To watch Jones’ track record, click here.) Again, we’re looking at a stock with a unanimous Strong Buy consensus based on 4 recent reviews. Pliant’s stock is selling for $15.53 and it has a $40.75 average price target suggesting an upside of ~162% over the next 12 months.

12/14/2021,"The bond market was sending a message, and it wasn’t one most people, fixated on the inflation rate, expected to hear: that inflation was nothing to worry about. Of course, that contradicts what Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told Congress on Dec. 1, when he changed course and conceded that inflation, which has been running well above the Fed’s target, may not be a temporary phenomenon. The bond market’s reaction suggests that it’s no joke. “The bond market is starting to tell you that there is not this urgency to raise rates quite as much,” says Andrew Slimmon, senior portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Asset Management.",Business/Barrons.com•2 days ago,"If Inflation Isn’t a Threat, These Beaten-Up Stocks Might Be a Bargain",https://finance.yahoo.com/m/57899773-3d60-3aae-b90b-399deca1634b/if-inflation-isn%E2%80%99t-a-threat-.html
