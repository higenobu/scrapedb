1/27/2022,"The United States has donated more than 400m vaccine doses to 112 countries, marking a major milestone in the White House’s goal of donating 1.2bn vaccine doses under president Joe Biden’s direction.  In a press briefing on Wednesday, the White House Covid-19 response coordinator, Jeff Zients, said the donation is four times larger than that of any other country. Zients also revealed that the country hit another major milestone this week, with 70% of eligible seniors in the US having now received their booster shot. Half of all eligible adults in the country are now boosted. “This is significant progress, as the doctors and data have made crystal clear. Vaccinations and boosters provide the best protection,” Zients said. The daily averages of cases and hospital admissions have fallen over the past week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The current seven-day daily average of Covid-19 cases is approximately 692,400 cases per day, a 6% decrease from the previous week, while the seven-day average of hospital admissions is around 19,800 per day, an 8% decrease. However, the figure for seven-day average daily deaths is around 2,200 per day, an increase of 21%. “These data demonstrate that Covid-19 disease severity appears to be lower with the Omicron variant than with prior variants,” saidDr Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC. “Although it’s encouraging that Omicron appears to be causing less severe disease, it is important to remember that we are still facing a high overall burden of disease. “Milder does not mean mild,” the director added. “Now is the time to do what we know works: wear a mask, get vaccinated and get boosted.” Speaking at the press briefing, Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, said that scientists have been working on developing a “pan-coronavirus” vaccine, in order to induce “broad and durable protection against coronaviruses that are known, and some that are even at this point, unknown”. Nevertheless, those vaccines would take years to develop, he said. “I don’t want anyone to think that pan-coronavirus vaccines are literally around the corner in a month or two..” Zients also told reporters that approximately 85% of the Covid-19 antiviral pills that the US has purchased has been directly distributed to states. This has been done “the same way we distribute vaccines – for them to then put the pills in the most important places within their states, at local hospitals and health systems and other caregivers”, Zients said. The remaining 15% will be distributed directly to community health centers around the country, he added. Earlier this month, Biden announced that the US would purchase 20m of Pfizer’s Covid-19 antiviral pill Paxlovid, doubling its previous order of 10m. In data released by Pfizer last December, the pill was estimated to have reduced the risk of hospitalization or death due to Covid by 89% in high-risk adults.",News/World news,"US donated over 400m Covid-19 vaccine doses to 112 countries, says White House",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/us-covid-vaccine-donation-400-million-white-house
1/27/2022,"Though better known as the homeland of Hollywood, Los Angeles was built on oil. More than 5,200 oil and gas wells sprawl across the city, making it one of the largest urban oil fields in the country.  But on Wednesday, the Los Angeles City council voted unanimously to phase out drilling in the city, a move environmental justice advocates have been working toward for years. The city will now move forward with drafting an ordinance to ban new drilling and evaluate how to shutdown operating wells across the city. Officials will also initiate an analysis of the economic and job impacts and how to transition oil industry workers to clean energy jobs. In order to decommission existing oil operations, an amortization study must be also done on how oil companies can make back their investments if they haven’t already done so. “From Wilmington to the San Fernando Valley, gas, drilling and and oil wells have disproportionately effected the health of our working-class neighborhoods,” said council president Nury Martinez. “This is yet another example of how frontline communities disproportionately bear the impacts of pollution and climate change.” Calling the move one of the strongest policies in the entire nation, she said that “Los Angles is a city that constantly leads the way and today let it be a reminder that the city council prioritizes the health and well-being for every Angeleno”. Other members echoed her sentiments, voicing adamant support for the shift away from fossil fuels development. Many of them credited Stand LA, a coalition of environmental justice organizations founded in 2013, which has spent years organizing around the the issue and highlighting the devastating impact drilling has on residents. Nearly a third of Los Angeles oil and gas wells lie outside drill sites, scattered between homes, schools and parks, noted Vince Bertoni, director of planning for the city, citing data by the California geologic energy management division in a letter issued to the council last September. Thousands of residents live in close proximity to wells but the toxic effects are not evenly distributed, with less affluent Angelenos and people of color bearing the brunt of their environmental impact. A slew of studies have shown the toll drilling can have on public health, including higher rates of asthma and cardiovascular disease and increased risks of babies with low birth weights and other reproductive health issues. In a paper published last year, researchers from the University of Southern California (USC) noted that South LA residents – predominantly Black and Latino families – who live near active oil development have lower lung function. Deficient lung capacity “may contribute to environmental health disparities”, the researchers said, likening the health effects to daily exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke. Even the drill sites no longer in use pose a threat to health and the environment. According to an LA Times investigation published in 2020, abandoned wells in the city are still emitting toxic gases. “In this community-driven research, we found that living close to oil sites is associated with lower lung function,” said the researcher Jill Johnston, an assistant professor of preventive medicine at USC’s Keck School of Medicine in a statement, adding that “these impacts raise environmental justice concerns about the effects of urban oil drilling”. Oil industry officials cited the potential for negative economic impacts to the city in their criticism of the move, and the 8,300 jobs associated with extraction and development. “Shutting down domestic energy production not only puts Californians out of work and reduces taxes that pay for vital services, but it makes us more dependent on imported foreign oil from Saudi Arabia and Iraq that is tankered into LA’s crowded port,” Rock Zierman, CEO of California Independent Petroleum Association said, noting that California’s crude is more regulated than imports. He also questioned the city’s ability to legally move forward with the plan. “Taking someone’s property without compensation, particularly one which is duly permitted and highly regulated, is illegal and violates the US Constitution’s Fifth Amendment against illegal search and seizure,” he said. Kevin Slagle, a spokesman for the Western States Petroleum Association highlighted the economic impacts the decision will have on the city. “We very much understand the impacts [the ordinance] could have on Los Angeles County, its economy and the workers of our industry,” Slagle told the LA Daily News before the decision, adding that they have undertaken safety mitigation measures to limit public health impacts to the community. “A lot of our own workers and folks live, play and go to school in the same places,” Slagle said. “We certainly follow those studies. We do studies of our own on health impacts and we do our very best at all times to mitigate, understand and deal with any sort of health concerns that come out of our operations.” The Western States Petroleum Association could not be reached for additional comments after the vote, prior to publication. The city’s decision follows a separate motion from the Los Angeles county board of supervisors, which voted unanimously to phase out drilling in unincorporated areas last September on similar grounds. Supervisor Holly Mitchell, who penned two motions on the issue, said that of the tens of thousands of people living near drilling sites, close to 73% are people of color. The Inglewood oil field – a site that has on average produced up to 3.1bn barrels a year over the last decade – falls in Mitchell’s jurisdiction. “In addition to this equity issue, which should concern all of us, oil and gas drilling is contributing to the climate crisis, which we are collectively bearing witness to every single day,” Mitchell told the LA Times in September. The state of California is also moving forward with new rules requiring drilling to be set at least 3,200ft from “sensitive locations”, which include homes, schools, and hospitals. State officials are now undertaking a comprehensive economic analysis of the proposal. The plan, which was praised by environmental justice advocates, has been criticized because it enables existing wells to continue operating and only applies to new development. The California department of conservation geologic energy management division found roughly 30% of the state’s production occurs within the 3,200-foot threshold. Los Angeles is planning to go further. “It has been a long slog,” said councilmember Paul Koretz during the meeting, highlighting the ways in which drilling in his district has harmed residents. “This effort is over 100 years overdue – and it is about time.”",News/US news,Los Angeles city council votes to ban new urban oil and gas drilling in historic move,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/26/los-angeles-vote-phase-out-oil-and-gas-drilling
1/27/2022,"Good morning. Government senators join calls for a Covid royal commission, anxiety over a possible Russian military offensive in Ukraine heightens, and international students fear limbo after Western Australia’s snap border decision. Three Coalition senators have supported crossbench and opposition calls for a royal commission into Australia’s Covid pandemic response. Liberal Gerard Rennick, who has vowed to continue to withhold support for government legislation over the management of the pandemic, told Guardian Australia there “definitely needs to be a review into the way everything happened”, while National Matt Canavan said “all levels of government, not just the commonwealth” would need to submit evidence to any inquiry. A spokesperson for fellow National Sam McMahon has confirmed she also backed a royal commission. Labor’s Katy Gallagher added “there will have to be some assessment of all the decisions taken”, including accounting for $337bn in spending during the pandemic.  Nato allies are considering a US request for additional troops to be stationed throughout eastern Europe in response to Russia’s ongoing military buildup along Ukraine’s border. As many as 125,000 Russian soldiers have amassed over recent months, with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov warning of “retaliatory measures” if the “west continues its aggressive course”. Military analysts have ruled out the likelihood of a full scale military invasion and occupation based on current troop numbers and locations, but warn such a force could become available if Russia maintains the “current pace, in two to three weeks”. The US deputy secretary of state, Wendy Sherman, has warned Vladimir Putin could instigate military force before the middle of February. Thousands of international students have been caught in limbo and Western Australian universities claim they’ve “been thrown into chaos” by the decision to keep the state’s border closed due to the Omicron spread. The decision, announced last week by premier Mark McGowan, has left “hundreds” of international students caught in eastern states, with about 7,000, or 30% of the total cohort, still believed to be outside Australia. Many in the industry fear major job losses as a result, with the higher education sector already declining by 5% during 2020. A combination of global heating and plastic pollution could have a major impact on global fish stocks, new research from the University of Sydney suggests, posing significant concerns over animal numbers higher up the food chain.

A world-first shipment of liquid hydrogen was heralded by Scott Morrison as a harbinger of a great new Australian clean energy export industry. But environmental experts have questioned just how clean the brown-coal fuelled shipment really is, Graham Redfearn writes. As one analyst concludes: “If it’s more complex and more costly and more polluting than making hydrogen from renewables, why would you do it?” Inflation figures have the analysts spooked, and tipping interest rate rises just around the corner. But rather than buy into the hype, perhaps we should take the Reserve Bank of Australia at its word that a move isn’t imminent, Greg Jericho argues. “Underlying inflation – which the reserve bank is more concerned about when it comes to setting interest rates – at 2.6% was nicely within the RBA’s target band of 2%-3%.” Self-confessed “child of the internet” Angharad Yeo wants “nothing more than to zone out and look at my little pictures”.

1/27/2022,"A new raft of Conservative MPs are poised to send letters of no confidence in Boris Johnson when the long-awaited “partygate” report is published, as the prime minister was pressured by his supporters to oversee a complete clearout of No 10. The Guardian has learned that senior backbenchers are to move as a collective to force a no confidence vote in Johnson once senior civil servant Sue Gray releases her findings, which on Tuesday helped trigger a criminal inquiry.  Newly elected MPs wounded by the publicising of the so-called pork pie plot are understood to have remonstrated with more senior colleagues for leaving them exposed. But a consensus has now formed among more experienced MPs that Johnson should face a no confidence vote. “It’s the white, middle-aged backbencher he has to watch,” one MP said. “People who feel strongly about their morals and to whom this prime minister can’t offer anything personally.” Among those who are prepared to move against Johnson are more than two dozen former ministers – there are more than 70 in that category in total – according to the rebels’ latest calculations. There will be no group statement from the One Nation group of centrist Tories, which has more than 100 members. Instead, MPs said letters were more likely to come from smaller groups of like-minded MPs moving together. A consensus is also forming among Johnson’s allies that he cannot rely on the support of all his ministers, several of whom have expressed serious concerns to colleagues. While the prime minister’s supporters were bullish that the “window has passed” for his critics to make their move, several frontbenchers told the Guardian they were privately concerned about Scotland Yard launching its own investigation. One said: “Some of us are still waiting to make up our mind.” Another admitted: “If there’s any evidence of criminal wrongdoing by the prime minister, he can’t stay in post.” Gray’s report was said to be close to completion on Tuesday night, but there has been no official explanation for why it has not yet been sent to Johnson. A No 10 source denied Downing Street was pressuring Gray to publish a separate summary rather than the full findings. They said conversations were ongoing within the Cabinet Office over the Metropolitan police investigation and insisted there had not been an order made to delay the report’s publication. If Gray’s report is published on Thursday or Friday, Johnson is prepared to go to the Commons with it – despite the potential disruption of MPs’ plans in their constituencies. Behind the scenes, Johnson’s supporters are planning for how to avoid a no confidence vote once the report is released, or reduce the numbers who will vote against him if one is called. Ideas are being discussed to convince backbenchers that genuine changes will be made to key parts of the government machine, including a clearout of some No 10 political advisers. In a bid to restore discipline after a series of rebellions, the government whips office has also been tipped for an overhaul in the run up to the February recess. Chief whip Mark Spencer could be given a new job as an environment minister, with Chris Pincher – one of the main five MPs running a shadow whipping operation to save Johnson’s premiership – tipped as a potential replacement. Johnson’s allies hope the parliamentary recess beginning 10 February will act as a “firebreak” to calm colleagues down, with plans being drawn up for the prime minister to head away on trade trips to Australia and Japan. The shadow whipping operation is meeting up to three times a day – twice in-person and once virtually. It is organising in a nearly 100-strong WhatsApp “support group”. However there are fears some “spies” have infiltrated, and are briefing those who would back chancellor Rishi Sunak in a leadership contest. Senior members of the operation were said to have been told that two people who had submitted no confidence letters had withdrawn them. One minister said the message being given to colleagues was: “Unless you’re gonna kill the guy, back off – he’s going nowhere.” Keir Starmer used prime minister’s questions on Wednesday to press Johnson to resign if he misled parliament by insisting no Covid rules were broken. He said: “Frankly, the public have made up their minds. They know the prime minister is not fit for the job.” Johnson insisted he could not comment until Gray’s report was published, and was showered with helpful questions from Tory MPs about the vaccine rollout, jobs and Brexit. Afterwards, he spoke to more MPs one-to-one in his Commons office. One said they had requested a meeting with the prime minister in summer 2020, which was suddenly granted on Wednesday. However, a long-serving MP said they had been appalled by Johnson’s attitude in their face to face conversations which had enforced their position that the prime minister did not understand the seriousness of the situation. Mark Logan, elected as a Tory MP in 2019 for Bolton North East, told Sky News he had spoken to Johnson recently and made clear “there has to be a huge change” of heart by the prime minister as well as the “approach and the infrastructure around him”. Some Johnson critics have said there are circumstances where a no confidence vote would have to be paused in a volatile political environment. Representations would be made to Brady if tanks roll across the Ukrainian border that the vote of no confidence should be delayed for four weeks. “It’s not ideal timing for a leadership contest,” one of those who is considering putting a letter in admitted. Meanwhile, senior civil servants fear the blame will be pinned on them for the more than a dozen social gatherings reported to have taken place in No 10 and across Whitehall. Those civil servants who could be in the firing line include the cabinet secretary Simon Case, and the prime minister’s principal private secretary Martin Reynolds, who invited 100 Downing Street staff to a “bring your own booze” party in the first lockdown.",News/Politics,Tory MPs poised to send letters of no confidence in PM after ‘partygate’ report,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/26/tory-mps-poised-to-send-letters-of-no-confidence-in-pm-after-partygate-report
1/27/2022,"The emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani is expected to tell the US president, Joe Biden, that his country will provide some short-term emergency liquid gas to help replace any loss of supplies if Russia cuts off supplies to Germany. Qatar is looking to supply Europe through transferring excess supplies in storage in east Asia. It is also hoping to return to the European market on a bigger scale as its own production levels rise, but wants to see an end to an European Commission anti-trust investigation.  One source familiar with the talks said: “It looks as if they will have something to announce next week. There have been talks going on for a fortnight or more. It would be painful for Qatar but doable.” British sources, which are involved in separate talks with Qatar, believe Doha can help bail Europe out even though Germany, which is dependent on Russian natural gas, has no liquified gas import terminal. The bulk of Qatar’s gas is sold in Asian markets on long-term contracts, but sources said there was some flexibility, albeit nowhere not enough to replace a full Russian cut-off. The emir is due to meet Biden on Monday in Washington and the discussion will focus on how Qatar can help Europe from being plunged into darkness and cold if a conflict over Ukraine breaks out. Relations between the two countries are at an all-time high due to Qatar’s help with the US Afghan airlift, and a further promise of help from Doha on gas might tip the scales as Vladimir Putin decides if an invasion would be valuable. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has lavished praise on Qatar in recent months, and the only political tension has come over the pressure Qatar has put on the US to do more to release humanitarian funds to help Afghanistan famine. Qatar is the largest global supplier of liquefied natural gas (LNG) alongside Australia. Two-thirds of its sales in the Asian market are under long-term deals, sometimes 20 years. Australia, a close ally of the US, has already promised to help. Germany is dependent on Russian gas for its energy needs, drawing more than half of its gas imports from Russia against around 40% on average for the European Union, according to the EU’s statistics agency, Eurostat. Nikos Tsafos, energy specialist at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said Europe was due anyway to import record amounts of LNG in January, but the proportion being sent to Europe from Qatar remained at a floor of 1m tonnes a month. By contrast Asia is purchasing 5m tonnes from Qatar. In 2010 Qatar was broadly exporting equal amounts of gas to Europe and Asia. Some of this switch is down to Qatar’s hostility to a European Commission anti-trust investigation launched in 2018 looking at the way Qatar was selling long-term contracts into the European market. Qatar is looking for signs this investigation will wind down. Putin has always insisted that he will never use gas as a geopolitical weapon, and there is no guarantee Russia would try to plunge Germany into the dark if heavy western sanctions are imposed. A report from the Centre for American progress – a thinktank close to the Biden administration, warned this week: “In a fight over Ukraine, Russia would without a doubt be prepared to cut off gas supplies to Europe in winter. Furthermore, fighting in Ukraine could affect the flow of gas to Europe if pipelines are damaged or supplies are cut. Europe should therefore be taking immediate steps to prepare for a gas shortage this winter.” Germany receives its LNG via three terminals in Belgium, Holland or Poland. Another possible terminal is Rodvigo in Italy. Plans to build a German LNG terminal at Brunsbüttel have not yet borne fruit, despite pressure from the previous US administration. German energy executives remain optimistic that the close inter-dependence of Russia and Germany will prevent a breakdown in oil supplies, or a wider confrontation. Markus Krebber, chief executive of RWE, Germany’s largest electricity supplier, told the German press a full Russian blockade would leave Germany only able to cope for a very few weeks. If Putin did cut off supplies, it would be losing foreign exchange reserves, and spell the demise of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline since its defenders would no longer be able to argue that Russia had ring-fenced the project from geopolitical considerations. Krebber also advanced long-term plans to make German gas supplies more secure so “that gas suppliers have to secure their delivery obligations to a certain extent through long-term purchase contracts or storage”.",News/World news,Qatar in talks to supply gas to Europe if Russia cuts supplies,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/qatar-in-talks-to-supply-gas-to-europe-if-russia-cuts-supplies
1/27/2022,"The robot surgeon will see you now. For years, the world of medicine has been steadily advancing the art of robot-assisted procedures, enabling doctors to enhance their technique inside the operating theatre.  Now US researchers say a robot has successfully performed keyhole surgery on pigs all on its own – without the guiding hand of a human. Furthermore, they add, the robot surgeon produced “significantly better” results than humans. The breakthrough is another step towards the day when fully automated surgery can be performed on patients. The Smart Tissue Autonomous Robot (Star) carried out laparoscopic surgery to connect two ends of an intestine in four pigs. According to a paper published in Science Robotics, the robot excelled at the procedure, which requires a high level of precision and repetitive movements. Axel Krieger, of Johns Hopkins University, said it marked the first time a robot had performed laparoscopic surgery without human help. “Our findings show that we can automate one of the most intricate and delicate tasks in surgery: the reconnection of two ends of an intestine,” he said. “The Star performed the procedure in four animals and it produced significantly better results than humans performing the same procedure.” Connecting two ends of an intestine is a challenging procedure in gastrointestinal surgery, requiring a surgeon to apply stitches – or sutures – with high accuracy and consistency. Even a slight hand tremor or misplaced stitch can result in a leak that could result in a patient suffering fatal complications. Krieger, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Johns Hopkins, helped create the robot, a vision-guided system designed specifically to suture soft tissue. It improves a 2016 model that repaired a pig’s intestines, but required a large incision to access the intestine and more guidance from humans. Experts say new features allow for improved surgical precision, including specialised suturing tools and imaging systems that provide more accurate visualisations of the surgical field. It is hard for robots to perform soft-tissue surgery because of how unpredictable it can be, forcing them to be able to adapt quickly to handle unexpected obstacles. The paper set out a novel control system in the Star that can adjust the surgical plan in real time, just as a human surgeon would. “What makes the Star special is that it is the first robotic system to plan, adapt, and execute a surgical plan in soft tissue with minimal human intervention,” Krieger said. “Robotic anastomosis (surgically joining two structures) is one way to ensure that surgical tasks that require high precision and repeatability can be performed with more accuracy and precision in every patient independent of surgeon skill. We hypothesise that this will result in a democratised surgical approach to patient care with more predictable and consistent patient outcomes.”",News/Technology,Robot successfully performs keyhole surgery on pigs without human help,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/26/robot-successfully-performs-keyhole-surgery-on-pigs-without-human-help
1/27/2022,"Prince Andrew has denied that he was a co-conspirator of Jeffrey Epstein, his lawyers said in court papers filed Wednesday. The Duke of York also denies that Epstein “trafficked girls to him”, his legal team wrote. These statements were filed as part of Virginia Giuffre’s sexual abuse lawsuit against the Duke of York in Manhattan federal court. Giuffre has long alleged that Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell forced her into a sexual encounter with the senior British royal 20 years ago, when she was 17.  Andrew’s denials were part of his “answer and affirmative defenses” to Giuffre’s civil complaint against him. Andrew did say in this document that he met Epstein “in or around 1999”. “Prince Andrew hereby demands a trial by jury on all causes of action asserted in the complaint,” his lawyers also wrote. Epstein, a convicted sex offender, was apprehended in July 2019 for sex trafficking girls as young as 14. He killed himself about one month later in a Manhattan jail, while awaiting his sex-trafficking trial. Maxwell, daughter of the British press baron Robert Maxwell, was found guilty sex trafficking and related charges in December for luring girls as young as 14 into Epstein’s abusive orbit.

1/27/2022,"Vítor Pereira has attempted to placate Everton fans opposed to his appointment by giving an unusual public interview to defend his managerial record and claim “Pereira Out” graffiti on Goodison Park is evidence of passion rather than a personal attack. Everton’s latest managerial search strayed into farce on Wednesday when Pereira gave a lengthy interview to Sky Sports News while awaiting a decision from the club on his interview to succeed Rafael Benítez as manager. Within hours of it emerging on Tuesday that the Portuguese coach was Farhad Moshiri’s favoured candidate, graffiti was daubed on a wall at Goodison that read: “Pereira Out, Lampard In”. The former Chelsea and Derby manager Frank Lampard has also been interviewed for the vacancy.  Pereira had reached advanced negotiations with Moshiri, and Moshiri’s business associate Alisher Usmanov, with Everton’s majority shareholder again ignoring reservations among his board over his managerial choice. Whether Moshiri’s interest in the 53-year-old cools as a result of the negative reaction remains to be seen, but Pereira took the unorthodox step of publicly reacting to the criticism and selling his vision for Everton in the meantime. “This is the first time in my career that I see this kind of thing,” said the former Porto and Fenerbahce manager of the graffiti. “I never had in my career this kind of comment about me. My CV speaks for itself but I think this criticism is not to me, it’s the environment now because the club is not in a good position. “The supporters have passion and I think this passion is the power of the club. I remember when I watched Everton games a few years ago and sometimes the spirit of the supporters won the game. Passion in football can have a positive or a negative side. What a manager should do in this moment is bring again the positive passion from the supporters. I don’t think these are personal attacks.” Pereira insisted he had been approached by Everton after maintaining “a good relationship” with the chairman, Bill Kenwright, since first being interviewed for the job in 2013. He claimed to have had several interviews with Kenwright, Moshiri and others, and said: “They were enthusiastic about what I proposed to them. I felt in the meeting they were very positive. They have other candidates and this is the time for decisions. We wait for the decision.” Despite the negative reaction Pereira maintained he still wanted the job and could handle the pressure. “Yes of course [he wants the job] - I don’t have any doubt,” he said. “I did my work as a professional and now the decision is the club’s.” Everton fans staged another protest at the way the club is run under Moshiri outside Goodison on Wednesday. A sizeable crowd gathered at the ‘Dixie’ Dean statue and called for the billionaire to sack his board.

Pidcock, once seen as a candidate for leader by the left of the party, lost her seat in North West Durham at the 2019 election but was elected to the party’s national executive committee (NEC) in the following year.  Her resignation on Wednesday came after an attempt by the executive’s leftwing members to restore the whip to the former Labour leader. Despite having his party membership restored, Corbyn’s status as a Labour MP has been blocked by Starmer since 2020. That has continued amid a disagreement over a statement Corbyn made in the wake of a damaging equalities watchdog report on antisemitism in the Labour party during his tenure. NEC members do not have the decision-making power to restore the whip to Corbyn, but the motion was nevertheless defeated by Starmer’s allies on the executive by 23 votes to 14. Corbyn said he was “very disappointed” by the result. In a statement, Pidcock said the defection of the Conservative MP Christian Wakeford to Labour had “crystallised the unease” she had felt, saying that the “whooping by elected representatives of my own party, on that day, was so inappropriate and jarring for so many”. Pidcock, who is national secretary of the People’s Assembly, hit out at the current Labour leadership in her departing statement, saying it was “devoid of ideas, lacking vision … I can’t and won’t negotiate with these people any more.” She said the sum of their ideas was “just small tweaks to the status quo”. The departure of Pidcock from the NEC is likely to make little difference to Starmer’s control of the ruling body, which has authority on key issues such as party finances, election resources and candidate shortlists. Her likely replacement is the candidate who came next in the 2020 members’ ballot – Ann Henderson – who ran on the same leftwing slate as Pidcock and has previous experience on the committee.",News/Politics,Member of Labour’s ruling body resigns after failure to restore whip to Corbyn,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/26/laura-pidcock-resigns-labour-national-executive-committee-jeremy-corbyn
