3/25/2022,"What unites us in Europe? In the current crisis, when the world is changing from a rule-based to a power-based order, Europe is moving closer together and remembering its most important principle: rules and laws apply. This has been agreed in Porto and Helsinki, Bruges and Athens, Warsaw, Prague and Ljubljana. Football is a mosaic of social life. It contributes to negotiating and communicating values. Whether it finds acceptance and whether western society identifies with it depends on whether its competitions are fair and subject to good rules, ie whether many are allowed to participate with a chance of success. This works surprisingly well in the national teams, measured by the fact that the size of the countries is a decisive factor for them and no one in Europe wants to change anything about the sovereignty of their borders. There have been 10 different winners in 16 European Championship tournaments. The problem lies in club football. A lot of money flows into it, from which some leagues and teams profit disproportionately. This creates national monopolies and in the Champions League whole regions of Europe are left behind. It is now up to the competition authorities. “People go to football because they don’t know the result,” Sepp Herberger, the West Germany World Cup-winning coach of 1954, said. This is no longer true in Germany and the situation is similar in France. The two metropolises of Munich and Paris have developed into monopolies. Because Bayern are aiming for their 10th championship in a row, people in Germany are discussing play-offs. The title would then depend on a few games at the end of the season. This is how the Bundesliga is supposed to become exciting again. But play-offs cannot be the solution. They would only fight the symptoms, not the cause. Changing the mode does not replace the question: how do you organise competition so that football is fun and many are involved in it? The greatest density of competition is in the Premier League, where almost all clubs are in the hands of very rich owners. However, no attention has been paid to who is allowed to finance football as a national asset. Roman Abramovich has been hit with sanctions. And the debate on how to regulate who is allowed to invest under which conditions in the future is being conducted very intensively in England. In Europe, universal human rights must be fundamental in this question. International competition needs innovation, it needs to be reinvented regularly. The Champions League is attractive, the finals are watched by more than 100 million worldwide. But the winners of the past 11 years have come from three countries. In this century, no club from Scandinavia, the Balkans, east central Europe or eastern Europe has reached the semi-finals. The last one was Dynamo Kyiv in 1999. Does Europe’s football consist only of England, Spain, Germany, Italy and France? What about the other nations? Do they have to be happy to only play in the preliminary round? Benfica, for example, European Cup winners in 1961 and 1962, have a large stadium, many members and a rich tradition. The city exerts its charisma all the way to South America. Benfica are now in the quarter-finals, but because the Portuguese league is too small it is very difficult for the club to compete in the Champions League. The same can be said about Ajax.Prague, Warsaw, Budapest and Copenhagen are also only allowed to watch as soon as the decisive phase begins. Yet these great cities would be interesting for investors who could create the framework conditions for success. The record used to look different. The last 10 winners of the European Cup of Nations, as the Champions League was called before its introduction in 1992, came from eight countries, including Romania, Portugal, the Netherlands and Yugoslavia. This diversity has generated enthusiasm, made football socially relevant and the Champions League possible. Europe needs to find intelligent solutions at the negotiating table – to be cooperative, willing to compromise, and take different interests into account. This includes shaping a league that offers many a chance to succeed, sportingly and economically. It is not an easy task, but it is an interesting one. Uefa and all national associations have a responsibility here, including those who finance the sport. When, if not now, is the time for reform? The desire for change and the sense of solidarity are great at the moment. The experience with the planned Super League last year shows if the institutions do nothing, the matter could be taken out of their hands. But if a few top clubs then set the conditions, the most lucrative model of a European league will prevail, not the most culturally interesting. Europe has great appeal in the world because it adheres to its democratic order and stands for freedom and equality. This also applies to its sporting competitions, as long as they offer participation and equal opportunities. These are values that are constantly being rebalanced in an alliance of equal nations. The west is strengthening its cohesion in these days and weeks and football must make its contribution.",Sport/Sport,Football needs to unite and create a more level playing field in Europe | Philipp Lahm,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/25/football-needs-to-play-its-part-in-uniting-and-levelling-the-playing-field-in-europe
3/25/2022,"It’s the middle of the night and Murph has called her sister Jos for a chat. On her mind are the relative qualities of Julie Andrews and Emily Blunt, both cast as Mary Poppins 50 years apart. Where one brought purity, she argues, the other is complex. And that, in the dark, depressive early hours, seems quite wrong. This schism between the perfect and the damaged is at the heart of Uther Dean’s two-hander about sisterhood and suicide. Gripped by the doll’s house that sits at the front of Jenny Booth’s set, Murph and Jos have grown up with an impossible ideal. Neither can live up to the childhood image of perfection, just as neither can get the measure of how much injury and inspiration they inflict on each other. They sing pastiche show tunes (written by Dean and Oliver Devlin), but in the face of awkward reality, the Broadway romance fractures. Dean has the sensitivity not to depict mental illness in terms of cause and effect. The self-loathing that besets Murph and the dissatisfaction that haunts Jos are not qualities that can be explained away. Nor can the love-hate bond between them be seen as anything but complicated. It’s emotive, funny and distressing stuff, brilliantly handled by Icelandic director Kolbrún Björt Sigfúsdóttir in a studio production played with the precision of a classical composition. Eilidh Loan, author of the recent Moorcroft, proves herself as formidable an actor as she is a playwright, synchronising her performance as Murph to that of Anna Russell-Martin’s Jos with vigour and grace.

3/25/2022,"As one of his many criticisms of the BBC in recent years, Michael Grade called the broadcaster’s coverage of partygate “gleeful and disrespectful”, which must now seem ironic given the government’s own behaviour in appointing the Tory peer, without even a nod to the spirit of public sector appointment norms. It used to be the case that anyone harbouring ambitions for a top regulatory job, especially one in which they would be called upon to opine on impartiality, for example, should at the very least give the appearance that they were above the fray. But that’s not Lord Grade. The former chairman of the corporation may, as the government’s choice as chair of Ofcom, be called upon to judge the BBC’s journalism. But we already know how he feels about the BBC’s journalism. Just one more lapse, he wrote last year, just one, would “bring the house down”. We know how he feels about its principal source of income, the licence fee: at £159 a year, not only “regressive” but, in his view, “excessive”. We know what he thinks about how it pays staff and stars on receipt of that licence fee. “It may not be a lot of money to Gary Lineker or many of the BBC executives and commentators,” said the never conspicuously underpaid former head of ITV, Channel 4 and of the BBC itself, “but it’s a heck of a lot of money for the majority of people in this country.” No need to read tea leaves there then. Wonder what Grade thinks of the future of Channel 4? Why wonder? For he has also made it known that Channel 4 should be privatised and that internet platforms need to be held in check. What about YouTube? He once derided that as a “parasite”. You may agree, you may disagree. But it’s hard to make the case that he comes to any of this with clean hands. His trenchant views could not have been more visible if he had lit them up on ticker tape – essentially, big broadcasters and platforms are bad, free speech and Conservatives are good – and this has naturally endeared him, not just to his party’s backbenchers but of course to the two people now driving his appointment, Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, and Boris Johnson, guardians both of all that spiritually sustains us as a nation. Dorries is believed to have rejected the other Conservative peer who came close to getting the job – Stephen Gilbert – as being too much of a Cameroon. With Ed Vaizey also rejected for the job, despite years as a culture minister – a clear disqualification on the grounds of overqualification – the choice was never going to be anything other than political. It’s worth saying that Grade is a better appointment than the two men Johnson really wanted to appoint. Unlike Paul Dacre, former editor of the Daily Mail or Charles Moore, Johnson sage and former editor of the Telegraph, at least he knows a lot about broadcasting. But this is a bar set low for a job that, in a modern society still struggling with the benefits and disbenefits of technological change, matters to all of us. Grade may give the regulator a high public profile but is anyone truly convinced that a 79-year-old old-school broadcaster is the best person to wrestle with the pivotal challenge Ofcom faces: its new powers to regulate social media platforms, from Facebook to TikTok. It’s a matter of skill set, but also, again, of impartiality. Perhaps he will seek to flex his muscles with the technology companies; perhaps he should. But perhaps they will tie him up in lawsuits by juxtaposing any move against them with prior comments from him that betray that lack of impartiality; comments easily revealed by just a little light Googling. Two years after a genuine crossbench peer Lord Burns stepped down as chair of Ofcom, at least the mad, protracted recruitment process is over. The die seems cast. Once approved, Grade is expected to give up his seat on the Conservative benches in the House of Lords to sit as an independent crossbencher. But that will seem very much like closing the stable door after the horse has bolted. His views are known, his allegiances a matter of public record. Yet again a process that should uphold standards in public life debases them.

3/25/2022,"Famously no fan of punk – music he described as “against my religion” – bassist and founding member Steve Harris has always denied its influence on early Iron Maiden. But how else to account for this intriguing, compact curio on the B-side of Running Free, a perfect gene-splice between metal, Thin Lizzy and, well, punk? If calling Coming Home a ballad is pushing it a bit, it’s as close to a ballad as Maiden are likely to get, an indication that – had they wished – they could have aced AOR. A thoughtful reflection on touring and what you might call the philosophical pleasures of aviation, complete with stadium-sized chorus. The longest song in Maiden’s catalogue, a complex, 18-minute cinematic, episodic leviathan that tells the story of the British airship R-101’s final voyage. The work of the singer, Bruce Dickinson, who spent a month composing it on piano, it’s the sound of a band declining to rest on their considerable laurels and pushing into the unknown instead. 2021’s Senjutsu is a double album that’s best devoured in full – evidence that, nearly 50 years after they formed, Iron Maiden are in a remarkable creative purple patch – but if you had to pick one track, it might be the Harris-penned closer Hell on Earth: plaintive and explosive, with a killer vocal. “Let me tell you a story to chill the bones …” opens Dickinson in hammy style that has more to do with horror films than Dance of Death’s actual inspiration, Bergman’s The Seventh Seal. Dickinson performed Dance of Death live dressed as the Grim Reaper, summing the track up: it’s knowingly preposterous and genuinely gripping. The Somewhere in Time LP generated a degree of controversy among Iron Maiden diehards for its flagrant use of – gasp! – synthesisers, but the notion that this newfound interest might blunt their sound is demolished by the Adrian Smith-penned Sea of Madness: prima facie evidence that the album is under-rated. Harris summarised 2006’s acclaimed LP A Matter of Life and Death as “heavier than we’ve ever been”, which certainly fits The Longest Day. Among Maiden’s multitude of war epics, it might be the most brutal and horrifying – it certainly doesn’t sound like the work of multimillionaires in their 60s. The lyrics of the two-part saga of Charlotte the Harlot, a sort of metal equivalent of the Police’s Roxanne, haven’t aged terribly well – “All the men that are constantly drooling / It’s no life for you, stop all that screwing” – but the music on 22 Acacia Avenue is taut, dramatic and utterly thrilling. Founded on a warp-speed take on glam’s glitterbeat, Running Free is Maiden’s early, Paul Di’Anno-fronted years in miniature. It’s sharp, punchy and founded – despite the lyrical references to LA, which sound like the wishful work of someone who has never been further than Leytonstone. east London – in a desire for escape from grim urban reality. Most of 1988’s Seventh Son of a Seventh Son LP – a concept album – was suitably proggy, but The Evil That Men Do kicks against that particular trend. Relatively short and straightforwardly hard hitting, it sounds appealingly like the basic essence of Maiden in concentrated form. With due respect to the unfairly maligned Blaze Bayley, there was no mistaking the upswing when Dickinson returned after seven years to the vocalist’s role on Brave New World. You can hear it on Blood Brothers: the verses have a hint of folk about them, the chorus is pure emotive singalong, that seems to tangentially reference Dickinson’s return. Unfairly overshadowed by the historical epics on their previous LP, Powerslave, the closing track from Somewhere in Time is far better than its reputation suggests, with impeccably detailed lyrics: “He spread Hellenism far and wide … he paved the way for Christianity”. They have never played it live, which seems a shame. Iron Maiden’s years with Bayley as frontman are under-rated, but even their loudest critic should have a place in their heart for The Clansman – Harris-penned, Braveheart-inspired and Bayley’s finest moment. If you must have Dickinson, there’s a great 2020 live version. Dickinson is obviously Maiden’s greatest vocalist, but if you wanted to hear what Di’Anno brought to the band, then Wrathchild – the saga of a man searching for his absent father – would be perfect evidence. Fuelled by a rasping, believably street-tough grittiness, it deals in a noticeably different kind of rawness and power. The track that launched the Piece of Mind album, Flight of Icarus was a slightly abstruse choice of first single – it doesn’t have The Trooper’s grab-you-by-the-throat quality – but it’s fantastic. The Immigrant Song-like chug bears a soaring chorus, and the lyrics apparently view its doomed hero as a symbol of freedom and rebellion. Lyrically, a deeply odd, anomalous Maiden track, on which Smith seems to be questioning the point of being in the band. Conversely, he sets this burst of existential self-doubt to the kind of nailed-on chorus guaranteed to keep Maiden in business for the foreseeable future. It says something about the sheer quality of The Number of the Beast that a song as good as Children of the Damned feels like something of a deep cut. It leaps from acoustic ballad opening, to crunching Black Sabbath-ish riffing, to warp-speed drumming and guitar pyrotechnics. Still completely thrilling. On Powerslave’s lengthy, zero-fucks-given-for-the-dictates-of-fashion closer, Harris’s love of prog rock was finally given full episodic flower, complete with spoken-word interlude, sound effects and umpteen dynamic shifts through which the tension never lets up. A track that helped kickstart an entire progressive metal subgenre and briefly endeared Iron Maiden to a generation of O-level English teachers. A Top 10 hit and apparently at least partly inspired by Frank Sinatra’s My Way – it’s all in the ascending major 6th intervals, it seems. For a band debuting a new singer, Maiden sound completely imperious and swaggeringly powerful; people who know they’ve found the missing piece of the puzzle. The return of Dickinson and Smith to Maiden was announced in thunderous style, with one of the greatest album openers of the band’s career. A simple but ferociously hard-driving riff, with a chorus designed to be joyously bellowed along to en masse, it brought the overwhelming sense that the band were operating on full steam once more. Iron Maiden sounded worryingly listless in the early 90s. Exception that proves the rule: Fear of the Dark’s incredible title track. Listen to the bedlam its intro causes on 2002’s Live in Rio or 2005’s Death on the Road: the noise of the crowd is almost as exciting as the song itself. The greatest song to date of Maiden’s second Dickinson era features one of the band’s eternal themes – the futility of war – reanimated into eight minutes of detailed dynamic surges and horrifying lyrics: the protagonist ends up choking on his own blood. “A powerful and stirring body of music,” opined Dickinson, not unreasonably. Iron Maiden’s contribution to the satanic panic brought about by metal’s interest in the occult was inspired by a nightmare; the result of watching Damien: Omen II. Vincent Price declined to provide the opening narration and more fool him: The Number of the Beast is a tacky-but-terrifying Hammer horror film, perfectly wrought into song. A radio-friendly track that doesn’t sacrifice a scrap of Maiden’s power, 2 Minutes to Midnight is a no-punches-pulled protest song about war – riven with nuclear paranoia and replete with a reference to Belsen – that also features an air-punch-inducing chorus. And it is still grimly relevant: according to the Doomsday Clock referenced in the title, it’s now 100 seconds to midnight. Much of Maiden’s debut seemed to speak of the world from which they had sprung – a gritty take on hard rock born out of gigs in east London pubs – but Phantom of the Opera was something else: ambitious, lengthy and held together by a riff so undeniable it was, incredibly, used to flog Lucozade in the mid-80s. The sound of a band firing on all cylinders – Middle Eastern-inspired riffs, unexpectedly dreamy middle section, intricate soloing – but Powerslave’s force lies in Dickinson’s urgent performance. You can suggest a song about a dying Egyptian pharaoh realising that he’s mortal rather than a deity is faintly daft, but the dread in his voice makes it weirdly believable. Iron Maiden’s back catalogue is full of sudden changes, surges in power and accelerations in speed, but the most breathtaking of the lot might be the one at 7min 5sec in Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, when its ominous chug and synth-assisted atmospherics unexpectedly give way to a burst of all-out aggression. Powerslave – and umpteen gigs over the years – opens with arguably the most potent, aggressive, in-your-face Maiden song of the lot. Aces High charges along at Motörhead pace, simultaneously deft and heavy. Its authors probably wouldn’t thank you for saying it, but the chorus is the kind of soaring uplifting masterstroke that pop songwriters would kill for. The story of the Charge of the Light Brigade rendered into four minutes. The band’s trademark galloping rhythm has never sounded more appropriate and their harmonised guitar riffs have never found a more memorable expression than here. Less complex than some of Maiden’s historical epics, The Trooper’s currency is raw power. What puts The Number of the Beast’s closing track at the top of this list? It features possibly the greatest recorded example of Dave Murray and Adrian Smith’s dual guitars in action, a structure that, in its shifts in tempo and mood, reflects its condemned-man protagonist’s movement from confusion and “surmounting terror” to bold anger – vertical lift off is achieved at 4min 33sec – and a fantastic, edge-of-hysteria Dickinson vocal.

3/25/2022,"Leaked emails suggest that the Conservative peer Michelle Mone lobbied a health minister on behalf of a company seeking Covid contracts – five months after the point at which her lawyers said she had stopped doing anything for the firm. The documents add to questions surrounding Lady Mone’s account of her involvement in PPE Medpro, which was awarded government contracts worth more than £200m to supply personal protective equipment early in the pandemic. Several months later, according to the leaked emails, Mone was trying to help PPE Medpro secure a lucrative contract to supply the government with Covid-19 antigen tests. Mone has repeatedly sought to distance herself from PPE Medpro, whose business she first recommended to the government in early May 2020. When Mone’s referral of May 2020 became public, she said her involvement in the company went no further than a single recommendation to the then Cabinet Office minister Theodore Agnew. Her lawyer said: “Having taken the very simple, solitary and brief step of referring PPE Medpro as a potential supplier to the office of Lord Agnew, our client did not do anything further in respect of PPE Medpro.” However, emails seen by the Guardian from October 2020 suggest that Mone was by that point still promoting the company, which was selling Covid tests. Anthony Page, one of PPE Medpro’s directors, emailed the Tory peer James Bethell, then a minister at the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), on 6 October mentioning Mone’s involvement. “I write to you in my capacity as UK managing director of PPE Medpro,” Page said. “I understand that Baroness Mone has kindly made you aware of the company and our recently developed coronavirus antigen rapid test.” The email continued: “By way of introduction, PPE Medpro is a PPE and medical product supplier that, in recent months, has successfully completed orders of 235m units to DHSC.” In addition to his role as the sole public face of PPE Medpro, Page is a longtime senior employee in the Knox Group, the Isle of Man-based financial services firm run by Mone’s husband, Douglas Barrowman. Lawyers for Mone, who sold her stake in the Ultimo lingerie company before David Cameron made her a member of the House of Lords in 2015, have said she “was not connected to PPE Medpro in any capacity” and “has no involvement in the business”. Barrowman’s lawyers have similarly distanced him from the company, but they have not denied that he benefited financially from PPE Medpro’s business. Last month the Guardian revealed that leaked files appear to suggest that both Mone and Barrowman were secretly involved in PPE Medpro’s mask and surgical gowns business. The newly leaked emails between Bethell and Page suggest that Mone was subsequently also involved in supporting PPE Medpro’s attempt to secure a slice of the testing market. In his 6 October 2020 email, Page told the Tory minister that the “consortium behind PPE Medpro” had partnerships with two factories that could produce 1.9m Covid tests a day. “We are able to start production immediately following agreement of terms and on receipt of signed contract and PO [purchase order] from DHSC. I would welcome a dialogue with you and/or your team to get things moving.” According to a government source, Bethell then referred PPE Medpro to a specialist team of officials and consultants who gave him prompt, attentive service. PPE Medpro, the source added, was among a number of companies referred as potential Covid-testing suppliers that were given a similar priority service. The source, a government official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the process of prioritising well-connected firms offering coronavirus testing kits as akin to the government’s “VIP lane” for well-connected PPE firms. Despite the special attention, Page appears to have become impatient with his treatment by the department, complaining in an email to officials and copying in Bethell and Bethell’s private secretary. PPE Medpro ultimately failed in its testing bid. However, the government source believes officials gave PPE Medpro undue priority because of its political backing. “Given their lack of experience, PPE Medpro should have been turned down at the start for testing contracts, which were such a vital part of our response to the pandemic,” the official claimed. “But instead we tutored that company through the process because we knew that senior people were involved: we were very aware that Baroness Mone had held that initial discussion with Lord Bethell. “The concerns were already starting about the VIP lane that operated for PPE, yet here we were giving a special service to companies just because of their political connections.” Mone appears to have been still contacting officials on behalf of PPE Medpro four months after her contact with Bethell, and nine months after she first recommended the firm to Lord Agnew. Jacqui Rock, the chief commercial officer for NHS test and trace, told colleagues in February 2021 that Mone was “incandescent with rage” at the treatment of PPE Medpro over testing contracts, saying they had been “fobbed off”, and was planning to speak to Michael Gove and Matt Hancock about her concerns. Mone’s lawyer did not respond directly to questions from the Guardian about her referral of PPE Medpro to the government for Covid-19 tests, saying: “She has no involvement in the business.” Bethell did not respond to a request for comment. A DHSC spokesperson said there had been “a rigorous scientific validation process with officials to ensure no products were progressed that did not meet the required specification”. Page denied that the company was given preferential treatment because of Mone’s recommendation, saying that PPE Medpro had already been working with the DHSC, so already had the necessary contacts. He blamed the company’s failure to secure testing contracts on “adverse press” and “the process being frustrated by the various testing phases,” although he said they “passed at each phase”.",News/World news,"Tory peer lobbied for PPE firm months after lawyers said she had stopped, leaked emails suggest ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/25/tory-peer-lobbied-for-ppe-firm-months-after-lawyers-said-she-had-stopped-leaked-emails-suggest
3/25/2022,"Tommy “Shots” Gioeli was once a powerful and feared figure as he plotted hits as a reputed leader of the Colombo crime family. Now, at 69, Gioeli is imprisoned and sick, unsuccessfully pleading for mercy as two cancers attack his body. Like many other federal prisoners, Gioeli asked a judge to grant compassionate release, a term which effectively means early release from incarceration for factors such as illness or advanced age. The First Step Act of 2018 allows inmates to petition courts directly, and these requests have surged during the Covid-19 pandemic as many elderly, ill or otherwise at risk inmates have sought to avoid the virus which has spread through the US penal system. But unlike most other prisoners, Gioeli asked for compassionate release as a convicted mobster. Some attorneys believe that judges fail to see people who were involved with organized crime, or criminal enterprises, as anything but lifelong criminals, diminishing their prospects of obtaining compassionate release. They see men like Gioeli – and other aging mobsters and gangsters – as being unfairly discriminated against, even in the face of a global pandemic that puts their lives at risk or as they face debilitating or life-threatening diseases. In 2012, a Brooklyn federal court jury convicted Gioeli of racketeering murder conspiracy, for planning to kill mafiosi about 30 years ago. He was acquitted of substantive murder charges, including involvement in the 1997 slaying of a New York City police officer. Judge Brian Cogan sentenced Gioeli to 20 years in prison. Federal prisoners who demonstrate good behavior typically serve about 85% of their sentences; as Gioeli has been incarcerated since his 2008 arrest, that means he could be up for release in 2024. With the First Step Act, Gioeli was able to ask Cogan for compassionate release earlier and first did so in May 2020, citing Covid-19. Cogan denied his request. Cogan cited procedural and historical grounds. Of the latter, Cogan wrote that Gioeli “is an upper echelon mafia leader who has committed heinous misconduct.” “The danger posed by mob leaders, like defendant, is not that these leaders will personally engage in acts of violence, but that they ‘can command others to do so’,” Cogan said in his ruling. In late 2021, Gioeli again asked for compassionate release so that he can receive medical treatment, contending that healthcare provided by the US Bureau of Prisons (BOP) cannot meet his dire needs. Gioeli was diagnosed with bladder cancer in 2018, and didn’t receive adequate follow-up care for three years, his attorney, Jennifer Louis-Jeune, said. Doctors in July 2021 found that the bladder cancer had returned. In December, Gioeli was diagnosed with a recurrence of prostate cancer, according to court papers and proceedings. Louis-Jeune asked Cogan for compassionate release – or alternatively, release to home confinement – so that he could get better medical treatment for his cancers. During a hearing in January, Cogan recognized that Gioeli’s medical problems were the kind of “extraordinary and compelling conditions” that weigh towards compassionate release. Cogan indicated skepticism about whether Gioeli had actually changed, saying, “If he’s a changed person, why is there not any acknowledgment that ‘I’ve lived my life as a mafia soldier and that was bad, that was wrong’,” Cogan said later, pointing to years-old blog posts where Gioeli railed against prosecutors and jurists, including Cogan. In a subsequent court filing, Louis-Jeune addressed Cogan’s queries about repentance and blog posts in detail, providing the judge statements from Gioeli. “I acknowledge the crimes I was convicted of. If I am released I will not associate, discuss or communicate with anyone involved in any crime,” Gioeli said. Cogan was not swayed. He denied Gioeli’s request Wednesday. Giolei’s health concerns were grave, Cogan said, but “the unfortunate fact in this case is that defendant’s crimes were so heinous and the nature of his leadership role so dangerous that release would not be appropriate.” The Bureau of Prisons said that it could not discuss individual inmates’ situations because of privacy concerns, but stood by its healthcare, saying in a statement: “The BOP has an ample number of trained medical personnel who provide essential medical, dental, and mental health (psychiatric) services in a manner consistent with accepted community clinical guidelines for a correctional environment.” Defendants elsewhere in the country have seen judges question their rehabilitation and remorse over past ties to criminal groups, or because their crimes operated at a more complex level. “That stigma sticks to whoever it is that is trying to petition in this scenario for a compassionate release, no matter what the accusations are,” said defense attorney Gal Pissetzky, who represents Gustavo Colon, former leader of Chicago’s Latin Kings. Colon went to Illinois state prison in 1975 and served 25 years for a murder he committed as a teen. Right before Colon’s planned release, he was hit with federal narcotics charges for running a drug organization from prison. Colon was convicted and remains incarcerated. He is 66. “The feds basically put on him ‘he is the leader of the Latin Kings in Chicago, or was at the time of the offense’… instead of from the perspective of ‘this is a drug case, he is an older man who’s been locked up in prison, literally since he was a teenager,’” Pissetzky said. A judge denied Colon’s request for compassionate release in December 2020, citing in her decision “the severity of the conduct, the amount of the drugs distributed, Mr Colon’s unquestionable leadership role, and the aggravating fact that Mr Colon orchestrated this criminal conduct from state custody”. Kari Beeman has long been fighting for the compassionate release of her 81-year-old uncle, John Kime. While not affiliated with a crime family or gang, Kime was convicted in 1995 of being the ringleader of a “criminal enterprise” as well as drug and gun charges, and sentenced to 75 years. In April 2021, Iowa federal judge Rebecca Ebinger denied Kime’s pandemic and health-based request for compassionate release. “Kime remains a danger if released,” Ebinger wrote, saying that this outweighed his health and pandemic concerns. “A significant period of incarceration is necessary to reflect the seriousness of the offenses, to provide just punishment for the offenses, and to protect the public from further crimes committed by Kime.” “We still love him – no matter what, we love him,” Beeman said. “But we now can’t be a part of his life because they can do whatever they want.” The prosecutors in Gioeli, Colon and Kime’s cases have all opposed compassionate release. They did not provide additional comment. Before Cogan’s decision came down, Gioeli said he continues to hope for compassionate release. “The BOP has had multiple chances to give me adequate medical care and has failed brilliantly, so why should they be given another chance to screw up?” Gioeli told the Guardian in a statement provided through Louis-Jeune. “After all, I have two aggressive cancers. I am in the fight of my life, for my very life, and all I ask for is a chance.” Louis-Jeune said that she will appeal Cogan’s decision.",News/US news,Prisoners with links to organized crime are commonly denied compassionate release ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/25/prisoners-organized-crime-denied-compassionate-release
3/25/2022,"Retail sales in Great Britain fell unexpectedly in February as consumers switched spending to eating out more after the economy reopened, while storms also deterred people from hitting the shops. Official figures showed that sales fell by 0.3% last month after a 1.9% increase in January. Economists had forecast a 0.6% rise in February. The figures also suggested the rising cost of living was starting to be felt, with shoppers spending 0.7% more over the month but buying 0.3% fewer goods, as their money failed to go as far as in previous months. Online retail sales fell 4.8% in February after increases in January and December when Omicron fears prompted people to stay away from the shops. With people venturing out more, the proportion of online retail sales dropped to its lowest level since March 2020, at 22.7%, having peaked in February 2021 at 37.7%. “After a buoyant January, retail sales fell back a little last month. There was a notable decline for companies that predominantly trade online, following a strong performance over the festive and new year period,” said Heather Bovill, the deputy director for surveys and economic indicators at the Office for National Statistics. “Food sales dipped with significant falls for alcohol and tobacco stores as more consumers went out to pubs and restaurants. More socialising as well as many of us returning to the workplace meant a good month for clothing and department stores, with people looking to expand their wardrobes.” Petrol and diesel sales rose above pre-pandemic levels for the first time as the lifting of the government’s plan B restrictions to curb the spread of Omicron fuelled an increase in commuting for work and trips to out-of-town shopping centres. Clothing sales soared by 13%, while there was a 1.3% rise for department stores, as people updated their casual coronavirus wardrobes for work and wider socialising, pushing overall non-food store sales volumes up 0.6%. A return to spending in pubs and restaurants led to overall food sales dropping by 0.2%, with a 16% fall at alcohol and tobacco stores, with volumes falling below pre-pandemic levels. Sales at supermarkets, which have experienced booming food sales during the pandemic, rose by 0.3%. However, there was a 2% fall for specialist food stores, such as butchers and bakers. While clothing and department stores fared well, sales at other non-food stores fell by 7%, and sales at household goods stores dropped 2.5%. The ONS said feedback from retailers suggested that February’s stormy weather curbed shopping habits. Britain’s cost of living squeeze intensified last month, with inflation reaching a 30-year high of 6.2% in February, up from 5.5% in January, driven by the rising cost of petrol and diesel and a wide range of goods from food to toys and games. Emma-Lou Montgomery, an associate director at Fidelity International, said the latest retail sales figures showed “the collective consumer belt-tightening has started to pinch”. She added: “We face an increasingly tricky financial situation, with rising costs meaning it is going to have to be necessities over ‘nice to haves’ for months to come. And there is little end in sight. Concerns that inflation will go much higher than the initially predicted 8% are rife, further impacting people’s willingness and ability to spend on anything more than the bare essentials.”",News/Business,Retail sales fall in Great Britain as storms and cost of living crisis hit habits,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/25/retail-sales-fall-in-great-britain-as-storms-and-cost-of-living-crisis-hit-habits
3/25/2022,"Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese believe, variously, that Marvel movies are either “despicable” or “not cinema”. Coppola’s nephew Nicolas Cage this week revealed that his only problem with the Disney-owned superhero cinematic universe is that it didn’t come into play early enough to help him avoid making those execrable Ghost Rider flicks. “Yeah, why do they do that?” Cage asked GQ when reminded of Coppola and Scorsese’s excoriating 2019 attacks on the MCU, which drew huge criticism at the time from Marvel film-makers such as Taika Waititi and James Gunn. “I don’t understand the conflict. I don’t agree with them on that perception or opinion.” Added Cage: “Marvel has done a really excellent job of entertaining the whole family. They put a lot of thought into it. It’s definitely had a big progression from when I was doing the first two Ghost Rider movies. Kevin Feige, or whoever is behind that machine, has found a masterful way of weaving the stories together and interconnecting all the characters.” Cage continued: “What could be wrong with wholesome entertainment that is appealing to parents and children, and gives people something to look forward to? I don’t see what the issue is.” You can’t really blame Cage for getting passionately involved – the lifelong comic book fan is so invested in Marvel that his stage name was inspired by the superhero Luke Cage. The Oscar-winner’s real name is Nicolas Kim Coppola. For those who need a recap, Scorsese sparked the original anti-Marvel furore with comments made during his Bafta’s David Lean lecture in October 2019, where he described cinema as having become like “amusement parks” thanks to an over abundance of superhero movies. He then doubled down in an interview with Empire, stating: “The value of a film that’s like a theme park film, for example, the Marvel-type pictures, where the theatres become amusement parks, that’s a different experience. I was saying earlier, it’s not cinema, it’s something else.” Coppola then backed up his buddy with comments made to journalists in Lyon after his acceptance of the Prix Lumière for contribution to cinema. “When Martin Scorsese says that the Marvel pictures are not cinema, he’s right because we expect to learn something from cinema, we expect to gain something, some enlightenment, some knowledge, some inspiration,” he said. “I don’t know that anyone gets anything out of seeing the same movie over and over again. Martin was kind when he said it’s not cinema. He didn’t say it’s despicable, which I just say it is.” Cage hinted that Coppola and Scorsese may have taken aim at Marvel because big-budget superhero films take spots that might once have gone to mid-budget indie movies, such as the ones he continues to star in. “I think that the movies that I make, like Pig or Joe, are not in any kind of conflict with Marvel movies,” Cage said. “I don’t think the Marvel movie had anything to do with the end of the tweener. By tweener, I mean the $30m to $50m budget movie. I think movies are in good shape.” Cage did star in a decent comic book movie, of course: 2010’s controversial Kick-Ass, in which he channelled Adam West-era Batman as a vigilante known as Big Daddy. But his comments on Marvel, along with his passion for comics, suggest that he would be more than keen to return to the MCU. Ghost Rider appeared in the spin-off TV show Agents of SHIELD, played by Gabriel Luna rather than Cage, but with the multiverse in full swing there’s no reason Feige and his team couldn’t reach out and bring back the original “man on fire”. Perhaps, with his nephew on board, Coppola may even be persuaded to take a second look at these movies he has so comprehensively dismissed. Realistically though, there’s probably a greater chance of The Godfather part four going into production than the veteran film-maker ever changing his mind on this one.",Arts/Film,‘Why do they do that?’: Nicolas Cage isn’t down with the Coppola-Scorsese Marvel bashing,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/25/why-do-they-do-that-nicolas-cage-isnt-down-with-the-coppola-scorsese-marvel-bashing
