5/6/2022,"Our scruffy lawn is fizzing with sparrows. For weeks they’ve roamed the garden in gangs, dust-bathing in the raised beds, fossicking and bickering in the untidiest corners. They come to this well-stocked builders’ merchant for its grasses, leaves, moss and feathers – even shreds of twine pulled from the apple espalier ties – to construct and line their loosely woven nests. Over by the greenhouse, two females are engaged in a tug-of-war over a strand of dead grass. On the patio, a male cocks his head and gives me an appraising stare. House sparrows (unlike many garden bird species) share building duties between the sexes, and this particular male is a connoisseur of fresh grass. He keeps returning to the edge of the lawn to gather soft leaf blades in his bill. They droop down either side of his black bib, giving him the air of a portly gentleman sporting luxurious green whiskers. In the honeysuckle there’s a squabble of spuggies in a disorderly queue. The tangled climber is shedding its skin, moulting tan-grey fibres that the sparrows and starlings peel away in thin strips. One of the females flies over the fence trailing her ribbons of bark. I watch covetously as she disappears under next door’s eaves – one of their regular nest sites. Several years back, we put up two sparrow terraces – each a row of three nest boxes – hoping to lure a few pairs to our side of the fence. One mid-terrace housed a colony of tree bumblebees. Blue tits raised chicks in the same box the following year. But no sparrows came. This spring, the signs are more promising. A couple of weeks ago, a male began inspecting the left-hand box, wisps of dried grass in his beak. Dithering at the hole, he feinted entry once, twice. When he finally crossed the threshold then reappeared moments later, empty-billed, I rejoiced. Frenetic building work ensued and now his mate is filching feathers from the chicken run, braving the outraged squawks of Moss, Cumulus and Burnet – our Orpington bantams – as she lines her nest with their fluffy castoffs. One well-appointed end-terrace – sold.

5/6/2022,"Victoria’s opposition has called on the premier, Daniel Andrews, to reveal how many times he has fronted the state’s anti-corruption watchdog following revelations he has been interviewed in a second probe. Opposition leader Matthew Guy on Friday accused Andrews of evading questions of probity and integrity that were “central to his government”. The Australian on Friday reported that Andrews had been questioned by the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission (Ibac) in private hearings over any links he may have to a property developer currently under investigation. It followed a report in The Age last week that Andrews had also been grilled by Ibac as part of its investigation into alleged branch stacking in the Victorian Labor party, and the misuse of public funds. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Andrews. Speaking to reporters on Friday, Guy said: “Victorians have a right to know how many other times has the premier been interviewed by the corruption commissioner and over what topics.” “The premier just needs to be upfront and frank to Victorians. We’re owed that, we’re owed the truth.” Guy emphasised that Andrews was questioned by Ibac behind closed doors, “something others were not afforded.” The state’s Ibac act states that hearings are not open to the public unless the watchdog considers on “reasonable grounds” there are exceptional circumstances or it is in the public interest to do so. The Victorian opposition has promised to boost Ibac’s funding by $10m per year and give it broader powers for public hearings if it wins the November election in a bid to rebuild a “system of integrity and honesty in government”. It would also increase the Victorian Ombudsman’s funding by $2m per year. On Friday, a Victorian government spokesperson said it would not comment on an active Ibac investigation. Following the story in The Age last week, Andrews said it would be “grossly inappropriate” for him to discuss matters before Ibac until a final report was tabled. The Age’s story was based on the leak of a draft report of Operation Watts – a joint investigation by Ibac and the Victorian Ombudsman into branch stacking and the misuse of public funds. It was prompted by allegations that former minister Adem Somyurek enlisted the help of staff for branch-stacking work. Somyurek has admitted he engaged in branch stacking but argued the practice – which is not illegal but against party rules – was widespread. It involves paying for people’s party membership to boost factional influence and have power over the preselection of candidates.",News/Australia news,Opposition demands Daniel Andrews reveal how often he has fronted Ibac after fresh revelation,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/06/victorian-opposition-demands-daniel-andrews-reveal-how-often-he-has-fronted-ibac-after-fresh-revelation
5/6/2022,"Local Tory leaders have called on Boris Johnson to consider his position after losses to the Lib Dems and Labour in the local elections which several blamed on Partygate and the cost of living crisis. The Conservatives suffered a near wipeout to Labour in Cumberland, where there are three Tory MPs, as well as losing control of West Oxfordshire and Portsmouth, with the Liberal Democrats becoming the largest party. In London, the Tories were also expected to lose their flagship Wandsworth council to Labour, as well as Barnet, and possibly even Westminster. By 4am on Friday, with almost half of all seats in England declared, the Tories had lose about 66 seats – or one in six contested – suggesting about 250 lost overall. However, Labour failed to make large gains in the rest of the country outside London, losing Hull council to the Lib Dems and not making huge progress in terms of seats outside the capital. Its strongest shows were in Cumberland, where it won 28 seats compared with seven for the Tories, and it was also expected to take Southampton. But it was the Lib Dems, independents and Green party who had gained the most seats in the early hours of the morning, particularly in the south of England. The Conservatives did not do as badly as many election experts predicted, especially after setting expectations low, with a string of backbenchers hitting the airwaves to defend Johnson in the early hours of the morning. However, disappointed Tory council leaders said MPs should reflect on the losses and consider removing Johnson from office. John Mallinson, Conservative leader of Carlisle city council, told the BBC that he had “lost some very good colleagues” in the Cumberland local election, and had found it “difficult to drag the debate back to local issues” while campaigning because of Partygate and the cost of living crisis. He also criticised the “patronising” comments of George Eustice, the environment secretary, who had suggested people struggling to buy food should opt for value brands. He added: “I think it is not just Partygate, there is the integrity issue. Basically I just don’t feel people any longer have the confidence that the prime minister can be relied upon to tell the truth.” Asked if Conservative MPs should remove Johnson, he said: “That would be my preference, yes.” The leaders of Portsmouth and Worcester councils also expressed frustration. Simon Bosher, the most senior Tory in Portsmouth, which was expected to see Lib Dem gains, said the leadership in Westminster needed to “take a good, long hard look in the mirror” to find out why he had lost four seats. Asked if he meant the prime minister when he referred to those in power, Bosher added: “I think Boris does need to take a good, strong look in the mirror as well because I think he needs to look at those people that we have lost tonight … because those are people that are actually bearing the brunt on the doorstep of behaviour of what’s been going on in Westminster. “There is a degree of anger and a degree of frustration” at the situation in Westminster, he said. In Worcester, the Tory council leader, Mark Bayliss, left his count early, saying it was a bad night for his party and blamed Partygate for traditional Conservative voters staying home. The council went into no overall control, with the Tories losing a seat each to Labour, the Lib Dems and Greens. Despite limited gains by Labour, the party pointed to 10 Brexit-voting areas where Labour gained vote share: Carlisle, Copeland, Great Grimsby, Hartlepool, Leigh, Lincoln, Southport, Thurrock, West Bromwich West and Workington. In terms of overall vote share in England, the Tories were down 4%, Labour was down 1%, the Lib Dems up 2% and the Greens up 3% compared with the same seats when they were last up for election in 2018. Sky reported an analysis that the Tories were down 10% since the 2019 general election, with Labour showing a small lead. “These results are confirming that the Conservatives have suffered something of a rebuff from the electorate,” said John Curtice, a professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde. He told the BBC that the Conservatives were losing ground more in the south than the north, and that the party’s southern MPs would be worried, even though the national picture “may not look quite as bad for the Tories as expected”. However, he also highlighted that Labour did not appear so far to be benefiting as much as they might have expected, with Lib Dems, Greens and independents taking as many wards off the Tories in the south.
