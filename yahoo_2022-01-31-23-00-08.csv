1/31/2022,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese trading and pharmaceutical company Kowa Co Ltd said on Monday anti-parasite drug ivermectin showed an ""antiviral effect"" against Omicron and other variants of coronavirus in joint non-clinical research. The company did not provide further details. The firm has been working with Kitasato University, a medical university in Tokyo, on testing the drug which is used to treat parasites in animals and humans, as a potential treatment for COVID-19. Clinical trials are ongoing but promotion of the drug as a COVID-19 treatment has generated controversy. The drug is not approved for treatment of COVID-19 in Japan and the U.S. Federal Drug Administration, the World Health Organization and the EU drug regulator have warned against its use.

1/31/2022,"Doing taxes in the U.S. is notoriously complicated and costly. And it gets even worse when there are delays and backlogs, making it especially hard to reach the Internal Revenue Service for assistance. But to me this raises an important question: Why should taxpayers have to navigate the tedious, costly tax filing system at all? In 1985, President Ronald Reagan promised a “return-free” tax system in which half of all Americans would never fill out a tax return again. Under the framework, taxpayers with simple returns would automatically receive a refund or a letter detailing any tax owed. Taxpayers with more complicated returns would use the system in place today. In 2006, President Barack Obama’s chief economist, Austan Goolsbee, suggested a “simple return,” in which taxpayers would receive already completed tax forms for their review or correction. Goolsbee estimated his system would save taxpayers more than US$2 billion a year in tax preparation fees. Though never implemented, the two proposals illustrate what we all know: No one enjoys filling out tax forms. So why do we have to? As an expert on the U.S. tax system, I see America’s costly and time-consuming tax reporting system as a consequence of its relationship with the commercial tax preparation industry, which lobbies Congress to maintain the status quo. Return-free filing is not difficult. At least 30 countries permit return-free filing, including Denmark, Sweden, Spain and the United Kingdom. Furthermore, 95% of American taxpayers receive at least one of more than 30 types of information returns that let the government know their exact income. These information returns give the government everything it needs to fill out most taxpayers’ returns. The U.S. system is 10 times more expensive than tax systems in 36 other countries with robust economies. But those costs vanish in a return-free system, as would the 2.6 billion hours Americans spend on tax preparation each year. Maybe you’re wondering whether Congress is just behind the times, unaware that it can release us from tax preparation? Not true. About two decades ago, Congress directed the IRS to provide low-income taxpayers with free tax preparation. The agency responded in 2002 with “Free File,” a public-private partnership between the government and the tax-preparation industry. As part of the deal, the IRS agreed not to compete with the private sector in the free tax preparation market. In 2007, the House of Representatives rejected legislation to provide free government tax preparation for all taxpayers. And in 2019, Congress tried to legally bar the IRS from ever providing free online tax preparation services. Only a public outcry turned the tide. The public part of Free File consists of the IRS herding taxpayers to commercial tax -preparation websites. The private part consists of those commercial entities diverting taxpayers toward costly alternatives. According to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, which oversees IRS activities, private partners use computer code to hide the free websites and take unsuspecting taxpayers to paid sites. Should a taxpayer discover a free preparation alternative, the private preparers impose various restrictions such as income or the use of various forms as an excuse to kick taxpayers back to paid preparation. Consequently, of the more than 100 million taxpayers eligible for free help, 35% end up paying for tax preparation and 60% never even visit the free websites. Instead of 70% of Americans receiving free tax preparation, commercial companies whittled that percentage down to 3%. Perhaps you are guessing that there are valid policy justifications for avoiding government and empowering the private sector. Judge those arguments yourself. One argument from commercial tax preparers is that taxpayers will miss out on valuable tax savings if they rely on free government preparation. In fact, the government software would reflect the same laws used by the paid preparers with the same access to tax saving deductions or credits. Further, tax preparers like H&R Block promise to pay all taxes and interest resulting from a failed audit. As a result, these services have every incentive to take conservative, pro-government tax positions. A second argument is that government-prepared tax returns encourage tax evasion. In a no-return system, the government reveals its knowledge of the taxpayer’s income before the taxpayer files. Thus, the argument goes, the taxpayer knows if the government has missed something and has reason to let the mistake stand. But taxpayers already know what information forms the government has because they receive duplicates of those forms. The incentive to lie does not increase because the taxpayer avoids weeks of tax preparation. Finally, there is the anti-tax argument for onerous tax preparation: Keep tax preparation unpleasant to fuel anti-tax sentiment. In the past, Republicans argued against high taxes. But after decades of tax cuts, Americans are no longer swayed by that argument. Exasperating tax preparation, according to this argument, helps keep the anti-tax fever high. And that fuels public hate for government and the tax system. Unfortunately, the anti-tax contingent’s desire to force Americans to spend time and money on tax preparation dovetails with the tax preparation industry’s desire to collect billions of dollars in fees. Tax preparation companies lobby Congress to keep tax preparation costly and complicated. Indeed, Intuit, maker of TurboTax, the tax preparation software, has listed government tax preparation as a threat to its business model. One example is the earned income tax credit, a government program for low-income people. The credit is so complicated that 20% of the people who are eligible never file, thus missing out on thousands of dollars in savings. If the government prepared everyone’s tax returns, that 20% would receive government support. Nonetheless, Intuit has lobbied lawmakers to make the credit more complicated, thereby driving more taxpayers to paid preparation services. In other words, it seems the tax preparation industry has kept the system complicated because the potential cost to it in terms of lost revenue is vast. I believe only public outcry can change the system. This article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit news site dedicated to sharing ideas from academic experts.

1/31/2022,"A white man from DeLand, Florida has been released from the Volusia County Jail after being arrested on charges of physically and verbally assaulting two Black high school students and their friend. Accused of stalking the students for two miles, smashing their windows, and hurling racial slurs at the minors, he is out on a $40,000 bond. MSN reports Richard Burnham was charged with three counts of aggravated assault and one count of criminal mischief in an incident that authorities say began with Burnham harassing three students after spotting them pumping gas. The 58-year-old man approached the Volusia County gas station and started to bombard the 17- and 18-year-olds with racial epithets, which bumped the charges up to a hate crime. On a call to 911, one of the teens said, “He was just kind of saying something to us and my friend who was driving. It’s his car, he told him like get away from the car, back up.” Reports state that after tossing the N-word and some other racial slurs in their direction, he went into the attached convenience store of the Circle K on State Road 415 in Osteen, Florida, around 3 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 22. After returning from the store, the teenagers reported that the situation escalated. Burnham had retrieved a metal pipe from his Dodge Ram truck and rushed toward the vehicle. “Somebody hit our window with a pole, we don’t know what type,” the victim said to the 911 dispatcher. “We don’t know what type of weapon it is but it was heavy and it shattered our window.” “He hit us,” the caller continued. “[And] we kind of like pulled. We tried to like pull out of the way so he couldn’t hit us again and my friend got out of the car to, like, say what are you doing and he tried to come back and hit us, so we left because we were scared.” The three drove away from Burnham, hoping to distance themselves from the attacker. Still, he followed them for two miles with his truck and trailer that towed two four-wheelers, on S.R. 415 before retreating, a report from My News 13 says. Law enforcement that investigated the scene observed the window was shattered on the passenger side of the 2022 Toyota Camry and the vehicle’s panels had several dents. Deputies arrested Burnham on Wednesday, Jan. 26, on charges of criminal mischief causing damage of $1,000 or more and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon without intent to kill, counts that have been enhanced under Florida’s hate crime law, which reclassifies crimes motivated by prejudice based on race, color, or ethnicity. The Volusia County Sheriff’s Office said on Jan. 22, that the enhancement was made because the man committed “an unprovoked, racially prejudiced attack on a car occupied by three high school students at a gas station in the Osteen area.” However, Burnham disputes that. His very different story claims the three high schoolers assaulted him. He says he was acting in retaliation to the young people shooting at him with an airsoft gun and threatening to kill him. The officers also noted that, unlike the teens, the elder white man did not call 911 nor did his story line up like the teens’ recollection of the event. More discrepancies were identified by the police on the scene, including the fact that no firearms were found on the young people.

1/31/2022,"A stunning revelation discovered by a German team of investigative journalists has put the prime suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann in the very resort from which she disappeared. Convicted pedophile Christian Brueckner, who has emerged as the only suspect in the 15-year-old cold case, worked as a handy man at the Ocean Club in Praia da Luz in the spring of 2007, according to the German documentary New Leads in the Maddie Case which will air on Monday evening in Europe. A producer on the show confirmed to The Daily Beast that they have handed over reams of investigative material to to German and Portuguese investigators that show Brueckner “repeatedly carried out repair work” in the Algarve resort and was in town when the McCanns spent their holiday there. Police Find Child’s Toy Bucket in Secret Sealed Cellar Being Searched for Madeleine McCann McCann disappeared from a bedroom in the holiday rental apartment where she was sleeping with her twin siblings just shy of her 4th birthday while her parents dined at a nearby tapas bar with friends. The couples had taken turns checking on the children and the time frame between checks in which McCann disappeared was less than an hour, implying that whoever nabbed her was familiar with the property. McCann’s parents were initially suspected by Portuguese authorities, which many believe led to the real perpetrator’s escape. They were eventually cleared in the case and went on to successfully sue a police investigator who wrote a book claiming their involvement. A spokesperson for the documentary said they had carried out a reconstruction of the evening and Brueckner would have easily had time to snatch the child. The public prosecutor in Germany, where Brueckner is serving a jail sentence for raping a 72-year-old American woman at a resort in Portugal, was also interviewed. “We are grateful to the SAT.1 team for sharing certain findings with the public prosecutor's office,” he says in the documentary, according to a clip. “There are witnesses who might prefer to speak to the media than to us or the police. If this produces any ideas we will of course follow these up.” Investigators have homed in on Brueckner, 45, since evidence including a child’s toy bucket was found buried in his back yard in 2020. Police first identified him as a potential suspect in the case in 2017 when it emerged he was living in an R.V. when she disappeared and phone records tie him to the Praia da Luz area the night she was abducted. He maintains his innocence and continues to write to journalists—including the German documentary makers—who will share his letters on the program Monday. An excerpt from the program says one of the letters contains a bizarre rant about his innocence. “Where possible, only drive during the day so my battered ‘hippy bus’ didn’t attract attention, only driving on roads I needed to and, most importantly, never provoking the police,” he wrote, according to the excerpt. “So, that means not committing any crimes, certainly not abducting anyone. Having said that, this was just as absurd to me at the time as starting a nuclear war or slaughtering a chicken.” German and Portuguese police continue to investigate the case supported by the British government’s Operation Grange which has spent hundreds of thousands of pounds investigating the case, citing no “definitive evidence whether she is alive or dead.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

1/31/2022,"Trump praised South Dakota Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg at a rally Saturday. Ravnsborg killed Joe Boever, 55, with his car in 2020, sparking legal and political repercussions. Ravnsborg struck a plea deal and paid a $500 fine, but is facing impeachment in South Dakota. Former President Donald Trump praised South Dakota Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg during a rally on Saturday. ""Thank you for being here. Appreciate it,"" Trump said to Ravnsborg, who was part of the crowd at the Save America rally in Conroe, Texas. ""They like you in Texas."" Back in South Dakota, Ravnsborg is facing widespread criticism and his popularity is extremely low. On September 12, 2020, Ravnsborg struck and killed a 55-year-old man named Joe Boever with his car while driving through North Dakota. He pleaded no contest in a criminal trial as part of a plea deal that resulted in a $500 fine. The death also led to the first ever impeachment proceeding in South Dakota. Those proceedings were put on hold while Ravnsborg's criminal case was active, but resumed in mid-January. Ravnsborg told investigators with the North Dakota Bureau of Investigation that he thought Boever was a deer, and only discovered it was a human when he returned to the site of the collision the next day. Investigators found that explanation implausible, saying Boever's DNA was found on the car's windshield and that Boever's glasses were found inside Ravnsborg's car. ""His face was in your windshield, Jason. Think about that,"" a detective told him during a September 30 interrogation. Ravnsborg admitted that he was reading a news story about Hunter Biden while driving. He was initially charged with three second-class misdemeanors, but pleaded no contest and struck a plea deal in August 2021 which saw him pay $500 for two misdemeanor charges. The third was dropped. Ravnsborg has since settled a case for damages with Boever's widow. Despite the scandal, Ravnsborg is seeking reelection as attorney general in the 2022 Republican Party primary.
