3/30/2022,"It was an electrifying development that has given renewed hope to some Tory rebels hoping to oust the prime minister. After all the bluff and bluster from Boris Johnson, the Metropolitan police announcement of 20 fixed-penalty notices for people over Downing Street parties is concrete confirmation that the authorities believe the rules were broken during lockdown. Barely four months ago, the prime minister insisted this was not the case, telling MPs after details of one party were revealed by the Mirror: “What I can tell the right hon and learned gentleman is that all guidance was followed completely in No 10.” Since then, many more parties have come to light, and Johnson has been forced to apologise for them. Despite this, No 10 is clearly hoping to ride out the remainder of the scandal by refusing to accept that any wrongdoing took place. The Ukraine war, allowing the prime minister to play the role of statesman abroad, has given his premiership new momentum, which he and his aides are desperate to hang on to. Johnson’s operation is also hiding behind a veil of privacy by saying they will refuse to name the 20 people who are to receive penalties for partying on the Downing Street estate. However, Tory MPs opposed to Johnson’s leadership do not believe this position will hold, suggesting No 10 has learned nothing from previous sleaze scandals where denial, cover-up and stonewalling gave way to a late-stage U-turn. They think Johnson will have to come clean if senior figures in his government have been issued with penalties and take responsibility for creating the culture in which this was allowed to take place. Already on Tuesday, Downing Street was forced to say it would in fact reveal if Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, receives a fine. In addition, if Johnson himself is personally issued with a penalty in the coming days or weeks, No 10 has accepted that it will have to reveal this significant fact. If this critical moment comes to pass, there are still dozens of Tories who believe Johnson should take the honourable step of resigning. Even loyalists such as Robert Buckland, a former lord chancellor sacked by the prime minister last year, highlighted on Tuesday that the prime minister is not above the law. “I think any head of government who has been found to have infringed the law has got some explaining to do,” he said. Behind closed doors, there are many Tory MPs who still believe – perhaps through wishful thinking – that this will be a tipping point of his premiership, despite the global uncertainties over the Russian invasion. Moreover, when all the fixed-penalty notices have been issued and the Met investigation is over, Johnson will still have to get through the publication of Sue Gray’s full report, which will go into more detail about alleged wrongdoing at each of the various parties. Some Tory MPs have come back onboard with the government, such as Andrew Bridgen, who previously submitted a letter of no confidence but on Tuesday urged colleagues to “get behind” the prime minister. However, there are other signs that Johnson’s government remains weak and divided, with Partygate having seriously undermined his authority – perhaps permanently. The whips were unable to stop a revolt of Tory backbenchers over the release of intelligence advice about Evgeny Lebedev’s peerage, despite the government clearly arguing the release would be a breach of protocol. The combination of the lockdown parties and the Owen Paterson sleaze scandal has left the Conservative rank and file in parliament unable to trust their leadership to make the right judgments on the issue of standards. And on this occasion, they refused to vote to block the publication of the peerage advice. It is an ominous sign for Johnson if he can no longer command his party – with a majority of 80 – to troop through the voting lobbies for him. The rebels may well not get the requisite 54 letters required for a confidence vote, and even if they do, Johnson may win the subsequent vote on whether he should stay on, particularly as Rishi Sunak’s badly received spring statement last week leaves them short of a convincing successor. But the fact remains that trust in Johnson’s leadership remains low, even on his own side, and that leads to the conditions in which a prime minister loses control of his own party, finding it very difficult to govern.",News/Politics,Partygate may prove to be the scandal that won’t go away for Boris Johnson,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/29/partygate-no-10-boris-johnson-conservative-party
3/30/2022,"Pulitzer prizewinning Margo Jefferson, playwright Winsome Pinnock and acclaimed novelist Tsitsi Dangarembga are among this year’s recipients of the $165,000 (£120,000) Windham-Campbell prizes. The award, which is one of the world’s richest, is now in its 10th year. For the past decade it has celebrated eight writers each year for their achievements in fiction, non fiction, poetry and drama. The large grants given to winners are intended “to support their writing and allow them to focus on their work independent of financial concerns”. PEN Pinter prizewinning Dangarembga’s debut novel Nervous Conditions was the first book to be published in English by a black woman from Zimbabwe. In September 2020 the writer-cum-activist’s novel This Mournable Body was longlisted for the Booker prize in the same week she was arrested during peaceful anti-corruption protests in Harare – she remains on remand. When she found out that the judges – who remain anonymous throughout the process – had chosen her for the Windham-Campbell prize, Dangarembga admitted she had been waiting for this news all of her life, “not always believing but constantly hoping”. Tsitsi Dangarembga (Zimbabwe) – fiction  Siphiwe Gloria Ndlovu (Zimbabwe) – fiction  Margo Jefferson (United States) – nonfiction  Emmanuel Iduma (Nigeria) – nonfiction  Winsome Pinnock (United Kingdom) – drama  Sharon Bridgforth (United States) – drama  Wong May (Ireland/Singapore/China) – poetry  Zaffar Kunial (United Kingdom) – poetry She said: “I desperately needed this award, as a writer working on the African continent. Few countries support creativity or the arts in a meaningful manner. Zimbabwe is amongst those that do so least.” “Now I will at last be able to slow down and breathe and contemplate my universe, allowing me do the work I want to do in the way I want to do it,” she added. “So basically the award is life giving.” Jefferson agreed that it feels “blissful” to have been chosen by the prize. The former New York Times staff writer has published two books so far, a 2006 biography of Michael Jackson and a 2015 memoir, Negroland, with a second memoir due out next month. Her books skilfully explore how we understand gender, race and mental illness, with Negroland called “captivating” by Guardian reviewer Colin Grant. “‘I’m in the Gobi Desert’ – that’s what friends and I say when we’re struggling through a piece of writing,” Jefferson said. “It’s how Edith Wharton described being in the middle of a novel.” The Windham-Campbell prize helps writers to get through such “deserts”, she explained, because it “honours the work you’ve done”, but also supports “the work you plan and hope to do. Maybe your plan is clear. Maybe you’re still in a dream space with half-formed thoughts and images. The prize says: trust your life as a writer.” British writer Pinnock, the first black woman to have a play staged at the National Theatre, wins her prize for an outstanding contribution to global theatre. The prize has described her plays, which include Leave Taking and Rockets and Blue Lights, as being “committed to taking formal risks and to asking difficult questions about the role of art in shaping cultures and institutions”. Like Dangarembga, Pinnock expressed excitement for the “freedom” that the prize money will afford her, allowing her to “experiment” and “work on projects in a non-pressured way”. Joining Pinnock on the list of winners is fellow playwright Sharon Bridgforth, who describes her work, a kind of blend of poetry and drama, as “performance literature”. The eight-strong lineup is completed by Zimbabwean novelist Siphiwe Gloria Ndlovu, Nigerian writer and photographer Emmanuel Iduma and poets Wong May and Zaffar Kunial. Michael Kelleher, director of the Windham-Campbell prizes, said he was proud to mark the 10th anniversary of the award with what he thinks is “the most exciting list of recipients yet”. He added: “Led by a trailblazing group of global women’s voices, these writers’ ambitious, skilful and moving work bridges the distance between the history of nations and a deeply personal sense of self.” The writer Donald Windham and his partner, the actor Sandy M Campbell, came up with the idea for an award that would highlight literary achievement and financially support writers to focus on their work. When Campbell died unexpectedly in 1988, his estate was left to Windham, under the agreement that the money would be combined with Windham’s to set up the prizes. Yale took on the administration after Windham’s death in 2010, and the first winners of the prizes were announced in 2013. Previous recipients include Yiyun Li, Tessa Hadley and Edmund de Waal.",Arts/Books,Zimbabwean novelist Tsitsi Dangarembga among this year’s Windham-Campbell prize winners,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/29/zimbabwean-novelist-tsitsi-dangarembga-among-this-years-windham-campbell-prize-winners-margo-jefferson-winsome-pinnock
3/30/2022,"In photographs released from the Russia-Ukraine talks in Istanbul on Tuesday, one face stood out, smiling as the negotiations got under way. Sanctioned billionaire Roman Abramovich is not officially part of the Russian delegation, but has apparently played a major role behind the scenes, jetting between Moscow, Kyiv and Istanbul since Russia invaded Ukraine. Further questions about what role Abramovich was playing, and why, were raised on Monday, when the Wall Street Journal and investigative outlet Bellingcat claimed Abramovich and a Ukrainian MP were among three people to fall ill with symptoms consistent with chemical poisoning, during a round of negotiations in Kyiv in early March. A source confirmed to the Guardian that Abramovich had fallen ill after the meeting, and had lost his sight for several hours. He soon recovered and was able to take part in later rounds of negotiations. News of the alleged poisoning has been met with widespread scepticism. In a rare case of Washington and Moscow agreeing on something during the past month, both capitals have given signals they do not believe the poisoning story. “The intelligence highly suggests this was environmental,” a US official told Reuters on Monday, adding: “Eg, not poisoning.” On Tuesday, Dmitry Peskov, Russian president Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson, added his own denial: “This is part of the information panic, part of the information sabotage, information war. These reports are not true … it is necessary to strongly filter the flow of information.” A spokesperson for the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, meanwhile, cautioned “only to follow official information”. Christo Grozev, of Bellingcat, said he stood by the claims. “We don’t know who did it but something did happen,” he said. Grozev has a record of uncovering poisoning attempts, including identifying the Russian hit squad that allegedly poisoned Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny in 2020. He said he would soon be able to release more information about the current incident. “We are trying to find a balance between protecting privacy and security concerns of the individuals and informing the public correctly,” Grozev said. Aside from the poisoning claims, the emergence of the publicity-shy oligarch at the heart of peace negotiations has also surprised many. In recent years, Abramovich has positioned himself as someone who has retired from the hard edge of business life and has no political ambitions. He has been known for funding cultural causes and generally living the high life. Although he can sometimes be spotted in Moscow art galleries, theatres or restaurants, the former Chelsea football club owner loathes publicity, and gives no interviews. Information about Abramovich’s wealth and lifestyle have instead tended to come from court cases, notably an epic 2012 battle in the London courts with his former benefactor Boris Berezovsky, who claimed Abramovich had swindled him out of several billion dollars by forcing him to sell his stake in oil company Sibneft at a reduced price. The judge found in Abramovich’s favour. More recently, Abramovich brought a libel case in London against journalist Catherine Belton, after contesting several claims in Belton’s book Putin’s People, including that he bought Chelsea at Putin’s request. Abramovich settled with Belton after her publisher agreed the book would acknowledge this was not a statement of fact. In that court case, his lawyers claimed “Abramovich is someone who is distant from Putin”, something which has been thrown into question by his sudden appearance as an envoy. A source in the Ukrainian delegation told news outlet Ukrayinska Pravda that Abramovich had positioned himself as a neutral intermediary, and his main role was “to pass on our position to their boss in human language”. Alexander Rodnyansky, an economic adviser to Zelenskiy, told the Guardian that Abramovich had been brought in as an intermediary by his father, a Ukrainian film producer who knows the billionaire well. In Kyiv, Abramovich is seen as, at the very least, a serious interlocutor who has Putin’s ear. Russia’s official negotiating team is mostly made up of second-tier officials not seen as influential, so Putin may have selected Abramovich as a more serious interlocutor to send to the Ukrainians. “Putin is looking for back channels. He doesn’t believe in anything that’s open. Everything should be a little bit conspiratorial,” said veteran Russian journalist Yevgenia Albats. A source in Moscow said Abramovich had been granted two personal meetings with Zelenskiy in Kyiv over the past month, claims which have not been confirmed by the Ukrainian side. After the visit during which Abramovich fell ill, he returned again for another trip to the Ukrainian capital, said the source. Zelenskiy, in his interview with Russian journalists over the weekend, said Abramovich was one of a number of Russian oligarchs who had contacted him offering to invest in the Ukrainian economy. “We got signals from him and from several other businessmen saying ‘let us help somehow, let us try to do something,’” said Zelenskiy. He also said Abramovich had been involved in unsuccessful discussions to organise humanitarian corridors. However, he did not mention Abramovich’s visits to Kyiv, or his own purported meetings with the oligarch. Albats said offers from Abramovich and other Russian businessmen to help Ukraine could come from horror at the war, but also self-interest and a desire to avoid crippling western sanctions. “It’s the way people are trying to save their villas, yachts and also to be on the right side of the struggle. Some of them at least are horrified. I know some who just couldn’t believe what happened,” said Albats. “Then there are some who are just concerned they’re unable to pay their cleaning ladies.” Many are sceptical about Abramovich’s reincarnation as peacemaker. “How could they have forgotten who this is? He is one of the biggest sponsors of Putin’s regime,” said Maria Pevchikh, a close associate of jailed opposition leader Navalny and the head of investigations for his Anti-Corruption Foundation. Pevchikh said she did not buy the idea that Abramovich could be an independent actor in the talks. “I’m 100% sure that this was coordinated with the Kremlin entirely. When you’ve been Putin’s puppet for 22 years you don’t suddenly go rogue,” she said.",News/World news,Why is Abramovich playing peacemaker in Russia-Ukraine crisis?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/29/why-is-abramovich-playing-peacemaker-in-russia-ukraine-crisis
3/30/2022,"Women in England will only be able to access abortion tablets online illegally because ministers are ending the “pills by post” trial, MPs have been warned before a crucial Commons vote on the scheme. Medical groups, pro-choice campaigners and women’s organisations say the government’s decision to end the two-year experiment will lead to those seeking to end a termination breaking the law and risking criminal charges. The Department of Health and Social Care sparked an outcry last month when it announced that it was extending the trial until the end of August but then scrapping it. The policy was brought in as a temporary measure when Covid-19 hit in spring 2020. It is being axed even though more than 150,000 women have used it since then, it has proved popular with women and has been hailed as “the single biggest positive revolution in abortion rights in the UK since the 1967 Abortion Act”. Under it, women no longer have to visit a hospital or clinic to take the first of two pills used to induce an abortion within the first 10 weeks of pregnancy. Instead, they are sent both tablets to take at home. Wales has made the service permanent and Scotland looks likely do the same. However, in a briefing to MPs, an alliance of medical and women’s groups as well as abortion providers warned that “banning telemedicine would force vulnerable women who cannot access in-clinic care back to unregulated online options, risking criminalisation”. The number of women who resorted to buying pills online fell by 88% when the trial began. MPs will help to decide the future of the scheme when they vote Wednesday on an amendment to the Health and Social Care Bill recently passed by the House of Lords. It seeks to overturn the ending of “pills by post” in September and make the scheme permanent. Pro-choice campaigners’ hopes of overturning the government’s policy have been boosted by MPs being given a free vote, in line with parliamentary tradition on abortion, which is seen as a matter of conscience. “Telemedicine for early medical abortion has been a success story of the pandemic, and the removal of this service would be an infringement on women’s rights to access the healthcare they deserve”, said Dr Edward Morris, the president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. “With the UK government due to publish the Women’s health strategy shortly, it would be completely inconsistent for them to choose to stop listening to women’s views on this vital area of their healthcare.” Some Tory MPs are backing the move to make “pills by post” permanent. They include former ministers Caroline Nokes, Sir Peter Bottomley and Crispin Blunt. Scraping the scheme is “a grave misjudgement” that is inconsistent with the government’s commitment to gender equality, they say. Louise Cudden, the UK advocacy and public affairs adviser at MSI Reproductive Choices, a global charity that provided 60,000 abortions in England last year, said: “From the World Health Organization, to the US Food and Drug Administration, to the government in Wales, there is a consensus that abortion pills can be safely taken at home. However, in England that choice is denied.” Campaigners fear that vulnerable women, including those experiencing domestic abuse or who have a controlling partner, will be denied the chance to have a termination unless ministers do a U-turn. “Before the pandemic we spoke every day to women who faced insurmountable barriers to accessing our help in a clinic, and we were powerless to help them,” said Clare Murphy, the chief executive of BPAS, another abortion provider. “We have shown we can help these women, and it would be an absolute travesty if that service was withdrawn and women forced again to turn to organisations like Women on Web to meet their reproductive healthcare needs”.",News/World news,MPs vote on whether to end abortion ‘pills by post’ in England,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/29/mps-vote-on-whether-to-end-abortion-pills-by-post-in-england
3/30/2022,"Christian Eriksen scored a brilliant goal as he made a triumphant return to the Parken Stadium where he almost died of a cardiac arrest last June, netting Denmark’s third in a 3-0 friendly win over Serbia on Tuesday. Eriksen, who scored with his first touch after coming on as a substitute in the 2-4 friendly defeat against the Netherlands in Amsterdam on Saturday, was guaranteed a warm welcome at the stadium that fell into shocked silence when he collapsed in the Euro 2020 group game against Finland. Joakim Maehle gave the Danes the lead with a thumping deflected drive in the 15th minute and Jesper Lindstrøm added a second eight minutes after the break as the home side enjoyed the better chances. Captaining the team, Eriksen gave the vocal Danish crowd what they wanted in the 57th minute, cutting on to his right foot and firing in a fizzing drive at the opposite end of the pitch to where he collapsed. Still building his fitness after restarting his club career at Brentford in February, Eriksen had his name chanted by the crowd as he was replaced in the 80th minute with Kasper Schmeichel kissing him on the head as he handed over the captain’s armband.

3/30/2022,"A Ukrainian soldier who told an officer on a Russian warship to “go fuck yourself” at the start of the invasion has been released as part of a prisoner exchange, and awarded a medal for his services, the Ukrainian ministry of defence said on Tuesday. Roman Hrybov, a Ukrainian border guard, was serving on Snake Island – a rocky outcrop south of the port of Odesa – when it came under Russian air and sea bombardment on the first day of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. When the detachment was asked to lay down their weapons, Hrybov responded by radio with a defiant: “Russian warship, go fuck yourself.” Initial reports said 13 border guards on the island had died after refusing to surrender, with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine saying each guard would be posthumously awarded the title Hero of Ukraine. But, just days later Ukraine’s state border guard said that the soldiers were still alive and had been taken captive by Russia. Adding to the confusion, Ukraine’s parliament later said that 19 servicemen (not 13 as initially reported) had been released as part of the first major prisoner swap with Russia. On Sunday, Zekenskiy said in an interview with Russian journalists that “some of the soldiers died, some were taken prisoner”. “All those who were taken prisoner were exchanged. Russia came up with this proposal. We exchanged them without hesitation … Those who died, they are heroes,” Zelenskiy said. #Ukraine Roman Hrybov, the Ukrainian soldier, who said the now-famous ""Russian warship, go fuck yourself"" phrase when asked to surrender, returned home.

The phrase became a rallying cry for Ukraine’s defenders and was commemorated in a postage stamp by the Ukrainian postal service. The use of the phrase by Ukrainian society has been lauded as one of the examples of how the country sought to undermine the legitimacy of Russia’s invasion through non-military means.

3/30/2022,"Police in Canada have laid a new charge against a “devil priest” hiding in France amid allegations he sexually abused multiple Inuit children. The case against Johannes Rivoire, who victims say has evaded justice for decades, received renewed focus this week when Canada’s Inuit leader requested the pope personally intervene during a visit to the Vatican by a delegation of Indigenous groups. Meeting privately with Pope Francis on Monday, Natan Obed, head of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, asked that Rivoire return to Canada to “stand trial for the harms he has done”. Obed called on the pope to use his “influence with the relevant authorities” to have Rivoire extradited, or for the priest to be tried in France. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said a Canada-wide arrest warrant was issued last month for Rivoire, 93, who currently lives in Lyon, France. Rivoire, a priest with the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, worked in several Arctic communities in the 1960s and 70s before returning to France in 1993. Inuk elder Peter Irniq told APTN News last year that his friend Marius Tungilik was one of the Rivoire’s victims. Tungilik died by suicide in 2012 at age 55. His friends say he was broken by the abuse he suffered at the hands of Rivoire. “[Marius] drank and drank and drank. He was very much haunted by this devil priest,” said Irniq. There are believed to be at least five other victims. Police laid three charges against Rivoire in 1998, but he was already in France. The charges were eventually stayed after Canadian authorities felt France’s policy of not extraditing citizens would limit their ability to bring to court. The new charge dates back to allegations occurring between 1974 and 1979. There is a publication ban on the identity of the complainant. Oblates of Mary Immaculate in Canada have called on Rivoire to turn himself over to authorities and the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops has said “the church should not stand in their way but assist those who have been victims to seek justice and healing”.",News/World news,Canada police renew effort to arrest ‘devil priest’ for alleged abuse of Inuit children,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/29/canada-police-johannes-rivoire-arrest-warrant-alleged-abuse
3/30/2022,"Sarina Wiegman has acknowledged that England’s captain, Steph Houghton, is in a race to be fit for the European Championship finals this summer. “It’s going to be very tight,” the England manager said as she named a 24-strong squad for the World Cup qualifiers against North Macedonia in Skopje and Northern Ireland in Belfast next month. “She’s had a tremendous CV with us so I hope she’ll make it but first of all she needs to start training again.” After captaining England to the semi-finals of their past three major tournaments, Houghton is desperate to be involved in the July showpiece on home soil but the central defender has barely played for Manchester City this season and underwent achilles surgery last month. Although she turns 34 next month and, because of injuries, has not played under Wiegman, Houghton remains sufficiently important to the Lionesses for Wiegman to give her until the last minute to prove her fitness. “We can give her a little more time because of the history she has with this group, over the years,” Wiegman said. “She’s been out for a long time but she came back in January and played well before then having to step out again. Her competitive instinct is really high and she’s doing everything she can to try and make the Euros, so we’ll see. She has a clear plan and we’re in contact all the time.” Wiegman said the squad for the forthcoming World Cup qualifiers was “close” to the group she hopes will contest the Euros but indicated there could be a place for the Manchester winger Chloe Kelly should she prove her fitness after major knee surgery. “The door is not closed to any other player but if anyone else comes in now it probably means we made the wrong decisions earlier,” Wiegman joked before explaining she was keeping a “close eye” on Kelly. “She’s had a pretty tough injury, an ACL. Hopefully, she will play again very soon – that’s what we expect. We know how good she was before she got injured but it will probably take a little time for her to get back to the level she’s capable of.” Goalkeepers Mary Earps (Manchester United), Hannah Hampton (Aston Villa), Ellie Roebuck (Manchester City).

3/30/2022,"Facing economic headwinds that will wreck millions of household budgets in the months ahead, the country’s poorest families are acutely vulnerable and exposed. Speaking to the House of Commons Treasury committee on Monday, the chair of the Office for Budget Responsibility confirmed that welfare benefits will lag significantly behind inflation for the next 18 months. The Resolution Foundation thinktank estimates that the cost-of-living squeeze will force 1.3 million people into absolute poverty next year, including 500,000 children. The incomes of the poorest quarter of households – the vast majority without savings to fall back on – are set to plummet by 6% in real terms. Providing next to nothing by way of direct support and mitigation, Rishi Sunak’s spring statement left these families to fend for themselves. To link benefits to the rising cost of living was just not “doable”, Mr Sunak told the Treasury committee. That is a political choice that, as a new study from the Centre for Social Justice makes distressingly clear, will exact a high toll in human misery; if the state refuses to provide an adequate safety net, predators will move into a world where desperate people resort to increasingly desperate measures. According to the CSJ report, Swimming With Sharks, over a million people in England are in debt to illegal and unregulated money lenders – 700,000 more than the last official estimate in 2010. Scammers, false “friends” who turn acquaintances into revenue streams and small-time mafiosi on housing estates have come into their own amid the economic fallout of austerity and the pandemic. The vast majority of loan shark victims have an income below £20,000, already owe money to legal creditors and are on benefits. Many use food banks, while almost half told interviewers that everyday costs – and in particular utility bills – drove borrowers to accept crippling and arbitrary terms, trapping them in a vicious cycle of never-ending debt. In harrowing case studies, the CSJ records grotesque physical and psychological abuse of those unable to meet repayments stretching indefinitely into the future. One young mother, harassed and badgered even while in hospital, was intimidated into paying back £1,000 for a £60 loan to buy a pram. More than one in 10 loan shark victims were found to have contemplated taking their own life at some point. Amid steepling food and fuel prices, and government inaction, this cohort of the panicked poor will exponentially expand as a perfect economic storm breaks. In the medium term, better solutions must be found to allow affordable access to credit for households at risk of going under financially. Expanding the scope, powers and profile of non-profit credit unions, as the CSJ report suggests, must become a policy priority. Greater resources for the government-funded Illegal Money Lending Team, which investigates and prosecutes illegal lenders, are also needed. But in the short term, there is a stark ethical imperative to boost the incomes of the least well-off now. This newspaper does not often agree with Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the founder of the CSJ. But he is right to say that, without urgent action, the scourge of loan sharks will become a shaming “sub-crisis”, as living standards drop faster than at any time since the 1950s. It is Mr Sunak’s responsibility to prevent this happening. The chancellor must be held morally accountable if he does not do so.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Sunak and the poor: an abdication of responsibility | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/29/the-guardian-view-on-sunak-and-the-poor-an-abdication-of-responsibility
3/30/2022,"More than two years after China imposed the world’s first Covid-19 lockdown, in response to the virus’s emergence in Wuhan, tens of millions are stuck at home once more. With cases at their highest since early 2020, the leadership is wedded to its zero-Covid strategy. For much of the pandemic, it allowed most people to live without restrictions within the country’s borders, and it certainly saved countless lives. Officially, mainland China’s death toll has remained under 5,000, despite a population of more than 1.3 billion; the UK, with 67 million inhabitants, has seen 165,000 deaths. But vaccines have offered an alternative, the transmissibility of Omicron makes it less feasible in the long term, and the economic and human costs are becoming less tolerable. Officials are now struggling to straddle two diverging goals: to control infections while shoring up the economy – one new study suggests lockdowns are costing at least $46bn a month. A “dynamic zero-Covid” approach of targeted restrictions, mass testing and isolation seeks to allow the swift relaxation of controls and minimisation of disruption and economic shock. Its biggest test to date may have arrived. Early on Monday, Shanghai – the country’s financial centre and home to 25 million residents – began a two-stage lockdown. The half of the city east of the Huangpu river is under tight restrictions until Friday, with mass testing (8 million in one day reportedly) and isolation of those found to be positive; it is then due to reopen while the other half closes. The leap in cases should be put into context. Earlier this year, China was reporting fewer than 100 cases a day; the 5,000-plus recorded on Monday are still a long way short of the 42,000 reported in the US that day. But Hong Kong, which earlier this month had the worst death rate in the world – recording more deaths per day than it had in the whole of the pandemic until then – has shown how quickly an outbreak can escalate. On the mainland, vaccination rates among older people are better, but the over-80s in particular are poorly protected. Reliance on a less effective homemade vaccine has come at a cost (intriguingly, there are reports that Shanghai is now supporting the import of Pfizer vaccines, though the decision will be Beijing’s). China may also be a victim of its own disease-control success, with people simply assuming they won’t encounter Covid. Though experts are clearly keen to edge away from zero-Covid, Beijing is unlikely to abandon the strategy before the year’s end (let alone admit to doing so). One reason is scientific: by then, China hopes to have more effective domestically produced vaccines. But the primary factor is political: this autumn will see the Communist party’s national congress, where it is assumed that Xi Jinping will break precedent by claiming a third five-year term as general secretary of the party. Social stability is paramount until then. So the country is likely to creep towards living with the virus long after others have cast off all restrictions. If that reflects an excess of caution, it also speaks to recklessness elsewhere. Living with Covid is not the same thing as pretending it does not exist. A calibration of measures makes more sense than an all-or-nothing approach. Free testing, decent sick pay, ongoing investment in prevalence studies, masking in spaces such as public transport, and improved ventilation would all help to keep rates down and protect the vulnerable. Britain, which has also seen infections surge in the last month, should take heed.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on China’s pandemic: the price of zero-Covid | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/29/the-guardian-view-on-chinas-pandemic-the-price-of-zero-covid
3/30/2022,"Mark Hartigan had his bonus for 2021, members of LV= may feel, when he got to keep his job as chief executive despite overseeing the shambles of the failed £530m sale of the mutual insurer to US private equity firm Bain Capital. That misadventure, remember, ended last December in humiliating fashion: the board, despite throwing the kitchen sink at its proposal, couldn’t get enough members to vote for it. A rapid clear-out of directors followed, with chairman Alan Cook heading for the exit, but Hartigan somehow escaped the cull. Now he’s popped up with a £515,000 bonus for his efforts in 2021. The award wasn’t a maximum jackpot (he slipped up on employee engagement, for example) but two-thirds ain’t bad after a year like the one LV+ had. Yes, as the remuneration report makes clear, the organisation hit its trading targets in areas such as capital generation and volume of new business, but the critical number was surely the £33m that was blown on the fruitless “strategic review” that backed the Bain sale. Members have got precisely nothing for their outlay on consultants and advisers. Instead, under Hartigan, LV= has moved full circle. The business was supposedly strong after selling its general insurance operations, meaning car and home policies, to Allianz for £1.1bn. Then, after the strategic review, the conclusion was that “business as usual does not work” and surrender to Bain was the best bet. Now, with a straight face after a year spent promoting demutualisation, Hartigan says LV= looks forward to being part of “a vibrant mutual sector”. A humbler chief executive would have let the dust settle and accepted that this was not a year to take a bonus. A wiser board of newcomers would have given him no choice. Round numbers in share prices shouldn’t matter, but let’s hear it anyway for AstraZeneca as the pharmaceuticals company on Tuesday closed above £100 for the first time. The FTSE 100 index’s second-largest company (a whisker behind Shell) has given its owners a rewarding ride since it was demerged as the unloved offspring of ICI (remember them?) in 1993. The share price at separation for the original Zeneca was 626p, so the capital appreciation over 29 years is 16 times – call it a doubling in value every seven-and-a-bit years. Very slick, but it also understates matters. Include the reinvestment of dividends and the pace was faster in reality. The merger with Swedish group Astra happened in 1999 at a share price of £29.46 but the more memorable figure is £55 in 2014. That was the level of the takeover offer from US group Pfizer. An AstraZeneca board, led then and now by chief executive Pascal Soriot and chairman Leif Johansson, mounted a high-risk defence that was long on hope for recent and yet-to-be-launched oncology treatments. Life might have worked out differently if Pfizer had bumped its bid by a couple of quid, but shareholders stayed loyal and Soriot has delivered on his revenue promises: $45bn by 2023 is virtually nailed-on to arrive a year early. As an example of the investment virtue of backing long-term winners, AstraZeneca is hard to beat. Johansson retires next year; there’s a nice gig for someone. Cue, too, a warning that “the impact of a prolonged or escalated conflict on SSE’s businesses is difficult to predict”. Fair point. High and volatile electricity prices also bring stiffer credit and collateral terms and, while SSE reckons it has been well served by its “breadth of businesses across the energy value chain”, clearly nothing is guaranteed. One can say this, though: the idea that SSE should do the splits and separate its renewables assets from its fuddy-duddy networks business looks even more of a non-starter. Activist investor Elliott Advisors pushed the argument last year and thankfully got nowhere. The case for SSE remaining as a single entity is stronger than ever: balance in earnings is plainly an advantage in the energy game these days.",News/Business,"LV=’s on board with £515,000 bonus for boss despite shambles of failed sale",https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/mar/29/lv-on-board-with-515000-bonus-for-boss-despite-shambles-of-failed-sale
3/30/2022,"The sight of Prince Andrew (one title he still has left) escorting his mum, the Queen, to her seat in Westminster Abbey this morning at the memorial service for the Duke of Edinburgh was enough to send social media watchers into conniptions. Goodness, he was actually grasping her elbow to steady her! And taking his seat next to his younger brother, Prince Edward, admittedly distanced from Charles and William by the breadth of an aisle. What was he doing there? Why was he invited? How dare he show his face, just a few weeks after paying millions of his mother’s money to Virginia Giuffre to settle the looming legal action in New York. Isn’t he a pariah, despite denying any culpability in the case? How could it be allowed? Had he no shame? (The answer is probably not, though you can’t deny that a degree of courage was needed to attend, knowing the world’s media would be watching.) Perhaps his mother gave him courage. Or perhaps it was insouciance. The answer is that his appearance at the service to honour his ancient father, who died last April a few weeks short of his 100th birthday, was inevitable. Black sheep though he is (is ram the better word?) he’s part of the family. His presence does not exonerate him, nor is it likely to be a sign of incipient recovery. His public life, like his string of titles, is behind him and will not be coming back. The Queen who finally, unsentimentally, stripped him of those titles last month knows that. In any event, the frosty looks on the faces of Charles and William – who are the real powerbrokers now – make clear that Andrew is out in the cold. If there’s one thing the royals value above loyalty, it’s survival – the tsar discovered that a hundred years ago when George V denied him and his family asylum after the Russian revolution. The rest of the family know that Andrew drags the whole show down. There is no public future for him, but he can hardly be denied attendance at what, despite all the pomp and circumstance of the Abbey service, was a personal and family occasion. After all, Andrew did attend his father’s funeral at Windsor 11 months ago when all the rest of the family were only too well aware of the quagmire he had got himself into. Expect his next public appearance, probably, to be at his mother’s funeral, whenever that finally comes to pass. Possibly of more concern to the royals will have been Prince Harry’s nonappearance. He stayed in California, perhaps still smarting that he does not qualify in this country for special police protection himself – one of the downsides of being an unroyal royal. He could have been at the abbey today to commemorate his grandfather, who had walked with him at his mother’s funeral, but he decided not to be. Such things will have been noticed at the palace.

3/30/2022,"A senior UN official has said they have seen videos purporting to show the abuse of prisoners of war on both sides in Ukraine, as Russia raised the mistreatment of its soldiers at the first day of the latest peace talks. Matilda Bogner, head of the UN’s human rights office in Ukraine, said a number of videos of the abuse of Russian and Ukrainian prisoners were being examined, adding that “on the face of it, it does raise serious concerns”. “It is important that these types of videos and that any ill treatment that may happen is stopped immediately,” she said, following the broadcast of footage that appeared to show Ukrainian soldiers shooting three captive Russians in their legs. In the grainy footage, which is being investigated by Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s government in Kyiv, three prisoners are seen being brought in from a car. A man with a blue armband then approaches them and says: “Hi” before shooting each of them in the leg. The Ukrainian government has said it is taking the footage “very seriously” although there is no independent evidence of its veracity yet. Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Zelenskiy, said: “if this turns out to be real, this is absolutely unacceptable behaviour”. One of the biggest promoters of the video was Maria Dubovikova, a political commentator at the Russian International Affairs Council. The BBC reported that the footage of Ukrainian soldiers being shot took place in a dairy plant in Malaya Rohan’, to the south-east of Kharkiv, which had been recently been re-taken by Ukrainian troops from Russian forces. Analysis of the weather conditions and troop movements further suggested that the video could have been shot in the early hours of Saturday 26 March. The Tass news agency reported that the Russian negotiators in Istanbul, where peace talks resumed on Tuesday after a two-week break, raised the issue of the abuse of prisoners of war. Russia also announced that it would “drastically reduce” military combat operations around the capital Kyiv, and the northern city of Chernihiv to “boost mutual trust” in peace talks.",News/World news,UN official concerned over videos showing apparent abuse of PoWs in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/29/un-official-concerned-over-videos-showing-apparent-abuse-of-pows-in-ukraine
