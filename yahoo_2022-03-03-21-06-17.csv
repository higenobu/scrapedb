3/3/2022,"There are plenty of fundamentally sound, low cost stocks out there for retail investors to consider. The key to success is to find stocks that are at or near the bottom of their cycle. Equity investment advisors will always tell you that ‘timing the market’ is impossible, and they’re right – but timing is still important for success. Investors need to buy into low prices, and to do that, they need to know when prices are low. This doesn’t necessarily mean low in absolute dollar terms, but low relative to a stock’s recent past performance. In recognizing that lower price range, investors can turn to Wall Street’s pros for help. The analysts have been busy lately, picking out stocks that are in their lower price range, and are flirting with the bottom. We’ve used the TipRanks database to look up three such stocks, Strong Buys with strong upside potential for the next few months – and each one is trading at or near its one-year low. Let’s take a closer look. Oportun Financial Corporation (OPRT) We’ll start in the financial services sector. Oportun is a digital banking platform that uses AI to back up inclusive, affordable financial services for more than 1.5 million members. The company’s customers can access savings, banking, investing services, including short-term loans and credit. The company offers alternatives to high-risk credit services such as payday and auto-title loans; Oportun’s customers can access personal loans between $300 and $10,000 with repayment terms between 1 and 4 years, and can apply for credit cards with limits between $300 and $1,000. Oportun has been in business since 2009, and in that time provided over $12 billion in affordable credit. Personal banking and credit services targeted at the lower end of the consumer financial market has become big business, and a look at Oportun’s recent performance bears this out. The company reported $194 million in quarterly revenue for 4Q21, and the quarter’s aggregate loan originations rose 93% to $865 million. For the full year 2021, these numbers reached $627 million and $2.3 billion – both company records. The company reported adjusted earnings of 82 cents per share, up 36% year-over-year, and well above the 72-cent forecast. Nevertheless, Oportun’s share price has fallen by 46% from the peak it reached in November of last year. This doesn't mean that the stock is unsound. 5-star analyst David Scharf, of JMP, takes an upbeat view of Oportun, writing: “Exiting 2021, we believe that Oportun represents one of the best positioned and most compelling growth stories in our Consumer Finance coverage... Our sense is that the company’s significant geographic, product, and channel expansion over the course of the past two years has been lost amid the broader investor focus on the pandemic and the related credit normalization that is underway. Yet OPRT’s management has been quietly and steadily building a diverse and comprehensive subprime platform…” Backing his optimistic view of the company, Scharf assigns the shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, and his $26 price target implies a robust upside of ~72% for the coming year. (To watch Scharf’s track record, click here) Overall, all 4 of the recent analyst reviews on OPRT are positive, making a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating, and the $26.25 average price target indicates potential for ~74% upside from the trading price of $15.11. (See OPRT stock forecast on TipRanks) Altra Industrial Motion (AIMC) We may live under the digital economy, and the financial and cyberspace sectors may drive much of what happens around us, but the physical world makes demands that cannot be avoided – and that is where Altra Industrial Motion comes in. This company manufactures motion control and power transmission products, for a wide range of sectors: cranes and hoists, the oil and gas industry, robotics and factory automation, precision motors, and medical and surgical tools. Altra produces a full range of equipment to control speed, torque, positioning, and braking, at every scale imaginable. The company operates in 17 countries and has over 48 production facilities. In its most recent quarter, 4Q21, Altra reported $469.8 million at the top line, flat sequentially but up a modest 3.7% year-over-year. While sales were slightly up, EPS was down. The reported non-GAAP earnings, at 67 cents per share, were down almost 12% y/y. On a positive note, the company also reported a record backlog, indicating high potential for future business, and guided toward full-year 2022 revenue in the range of $2.025 billion to $2.065 billion – which would translate to a 7.6% y/y gain at the midpoint. In a couple of recent organizational moves, Altra has taken action to emphasize its strengths and shed some weaknesses. The company entered an agreement to sell its JVS (Jacobs Vehicle Systems) business to Cummins for $325 million. This sale price was 40% higher than JVS’ share of the 2021 revenues. And, in January, Altra completed its acquisition, for an undisclosed sum, of Nook Industries, a leader in engineered linear motion. Nook showed approximately $42 million in revenue last year. Altra shares have been falling steadily for the past 12 months; the stock is down 32% in that period. However, Oppenheimer's 5-star analyst Bryan Blair points out the stock’s potential for a rebound, saying: “We believe valuation now excessively discounts Altra's business quality (including the fourth-highest EBITDA margins across IMFC coverage), the favorable positioning of its overall portfolio (with underappreciated exposure to factory automation, material handling/e-commerce, infrastructure, and medical technologies), and the through-the-cycle earnings power of combined PTT/A&S operations (supporting normalized FCF generation solidly >$250M). We view the stock's eye-catching valuation discount (notably >10 points on P/E) as disconnected from fundamentals, highlighting AIMC as a compelling value play."" To this end, Blair gives AIMC an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, along with a $67 price target that suggests an upside of 63% over the next 12 months. (To watch Blair’s track record, click here) While only three analysts have weighed in on Altra, their unanimous agreement gives the stock its Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $41.23 and have an average target of $65, for ~58% upside potential in the next 12 months. (See AIMC stock forecast on TipRanks) Axalta Coating Systems (AXTA) We’ll wrap up with another industrial stock, this one in something of a ‘leisure/luxury’ niche. Axalta, headquartered in Philadelphia, has produced and marketed a wide range of color and coating solutions for industrial and consumer use for the past 150 years. The company is particularly noted as provider of automotive coatings – paint jobs – but its full product line includes liquid and powder coatings for vehicles in the commercial, industrial, and agricultural sectors as well. In the past year, Axalta has seen revenues rise while earnings came under pressure. The company’s top line hit $1.14 billion in 4Q21, up 6% year-over-year and the best result in two years. For 2021 as a whole, revenues were reported at $4.42 billion, an 18% gain over the ‘COVID year’ of 2020, and indicative of a solid recovery. At the same time that revenue numbers are up, earnings have been slipping in recent quarters. Q4’s 30-cent adjusted EPS was down by almost half from the 58-sent EPS reported in the year-ago quarter. As a result, Axalta’s shares are down 20% so far this year. All may not be gloom for this industrial paint company, however, as BMO analyst John McNulty writes: “Conservative expectations/estimates, pricing accelerating while raw materials level, and continued strength in its end-markets, have AXTA poised to deliver in the near term. With a thin valuation, this execution should yield solid upside in the stock and help AXTA to 'break out' of the perpetual upper $20s/low $30s range it has held for the last five years. The risk/reward remains one of the most compelling in the sector…” Unsurprisingly, McNulty rates AXTA an Outperform (i.e. Buy), and his $40 price target shows the stock’s potential for ~53% upside in the months ahead. (To watch McNulty’s track record, click here) Axalta is a high-profile company, and has picked up 9 analyst reviews in recent weeks. These break down to 7 Buys and 2 Holds, for a Strong Buy analyst consensus. AXTA shares are selling for $26.13 and have an average price target of $35.56, giving the stock ~36% upside potential.

3/3/2022,"The economic problem list for Russian President Vladimir Putin is piling up, says big name investor Ed Hyman. Evercore ISI's closely followed chairman revealed seven key issues now facing Putin's economy in a new note Tuesday afternoon: ""The Ruble has plunged."" ""The plunge in the ruble could push inflation to over 20%+"" ""The stock market has plunged."" ""The policy rate is up to 20%."" ""Unprecedented economic sanctions are being applied."" ""Foreign companies are shutting down their Russian operations ""Russia is being cut off from the rest of the world."" To be sure, it's getting ugly for Russia in light of its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Well-known Western multinationals such as Mastercard, Visa, HP and BlackRock have sought to distance themselves from doing business in Russia. Yahoo Finance has an exhaustive list of companies pulling away from Russia. The maneuvers come as the West blocked ""selected"" Russian banks from the SWIFT payment system. The decision essentially denies Russia access to financial markets globally and opens its economy up to a potentially severe decline. The economic situation in Russia has turned so rapidly that JPMorgan strategists tell Yahoo Finance the country is ""uninvestable."" Global asset markets continue to reflect the yawning uncertainty around how the invasion will end and the long-term economic fallout. The S&P 500 tumbled 1.55% to 4,306.26 at the close Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 1.76% to 33,292.95. The Nasdaq Composite also dropped 1.59% to 13,532.46. Losses also hit the 10-year U.S. Treasury index slid to 1.7%. Meanwhile, Brent crude oil prices traded above $100 a barrel. ""I think given what is going on in Russia and Ukraine, especially with the weaponization of money that the Western world has decided to at least initially combat that with I think that has led to a flight into safe-havens inclusive of Treasuries. I think a lot of that buying is because of the uncertainty with regard to Russia,"" explained Charles Schwab chief investment strategist Liz Ann Sonders on Yahoo Finance Live. One winner this week has been bitcoin, suddenly viewed as a safe haven, reports Yahoo Finance's crypto reporter David Hollerith. Bitcoin prices traded up 7% Tuesday afternoon to about $44,000.

3/3/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could devastate global grain markets so deeply that it’s likely to be the biggest supply shock in living memory. Most Read from Bloomberg Russia’s Rating Cut to Junk; Talks on Tap: Ukraine Update China Holds Talks With Ukraine, Further Edging Away From Russia Resignation Sets In as Russians Face Their New Economic Reality Russian Oligarchs’ Yachts Head for Maldives as Sanctions Levied Billionaire Roman Abramovich Says He’s Selling Chelsea Football Club That’s according to Scott Irwin, an agricultural economist at the University of Illinois. Tens of millions of acres of grain production are at stake, he said Wednesday on Twitter. “I am convinced it is going to be the biggest supply shock to global grain markets in my lifetime,” Irwin said. The world “desperately” needs farmers to plant more acres in 2022, he said, but “basically nothing can be done in the short-run except to run up the price of grain high enough to ration demand.” Ukraine and Russia together account for more than a quarter of the global trade in wheat, as well as a fifth of corn sales. Prices for those staple crops are soaring on concerns over supply disruptions at a time when global food prices had already reached record highs. Even before Russia’s war with Ukraine, food inflation was already plaguing global consumers. Extreme weather has made it harder to grow crops, while a shortage of workers and higher shipping costs snarled supply chains. The world’s grain inventories are also very tight, so any prolonged disruptions to supplies from Russia or Ukraine has the potential to dislocate markets for years to come.

3/3/2022,"Pretty much everything in life costs money, including financial services. One mutual fund firm - Vanguard, already famous for its relatively low fees - is changing its expense ratios with the aim of returning a total of $1 billion in fees to its customers by 2025. This could impact you if you use Vanguard products or plan to in the future, so read on to get a fuller picture of the changes Vanguard is making - and if it could lead to more money in your account. For help with minimizing fees or any other personal finance issues, consider finding a professional to work with using SmartAsset's free financial advisor matching service. What Action Is Vanguard Taking? Vanguard announced that it was changing the expense ratio on 18 funds. The total deductions range from 1 basis point to 6 basis points. Some funds did see an increase in expense ratio, ranging from 1 basis point to 50 basis points. A basis point is equal to one one-hundredth of one percent, so a one basis point reduction is equal to a fee reduction of 0.01%. While that may seem like small potatoes, when you're talking about huge funds, the savings adds up. According to Vanguard's press release announcing this change, these changes will result in $34.2 million for investors. The fund seeing the biggest cuts are the Vanguard International High Dividend Yield ETF and the Vanguard International High Dividend Yield Index Admiral Shares, both of which are going down by six basis points. The fund seeing the biggest increase is the Vanguard Alternative Strategies Fund, an increase of 50 basis points. No other fund's expense ratio is increasing by more than a single basis point. Alternative strategies tend to be more complicated and require more work from fund managers, resulting in generally higher expense ratios. Why Is Vanguard Making These Changes? Vanguard, founded by Jack Bogle, is firm that essentially created index investing - creating funds that track stock indexes like the S&P 500 rather than employing a fund manager to make stock picks. Eliminating the need for stock picking allowed Vanguard to set expense ratios very low from the start, and it became synonymous with low-cost, index-focused investing. While other firms have since added index funds and worked to lower costs, Vanguard is sort of like the ""OG"" of low-cost investing. In 2019, Vanguard announced it was looking to take even more steps to lower the cost and eliminate the entry barrier to the world of investing, planning to cut fees by a total of $1 billion by 2025. As of February 2022, the firm has cut fees by a total of around $450 million, meaning the plan is to eliminate a further $650 million by 2025. Why Expense Ratios Matter Investing isn't easy, and there are a lot of details that some investors don't have the time to deal with. One thing that some novice investors don't account for is the expense ratio their mutual fund investments carry. There are plenty of stories of investors putting money into a fund and being shocked when a decent chunk of their earnings and investment are swallowed up by fees. If you're investing through a financial advisor or a 401(k) especially, there could be several layers of fees that pile up, leaving many investors wondering if it is even worth it to be in the investing games. Lower fees such as the ones Vanguard is offering could, in theory, encourage more novice and lower-net-worth investors to become involved in the market, meaning more people can benefit from economic growth rather than just rich people. The Bottom Line Vanguard is continuing its mission to cut $1 billion in expense ratio fees by 2025, cutting expense ratios on 18 funds and saving investors more than $32 million. The total saved by fee cuts since 2019 was around $450 million as of February 2022, with a further $650 million to come.

3/3/2022,"Which stocks are either a fan favorite or a must-avoid? Penny stocks. These tickers going for less than $5 apiece are particularly divisive on Wall Street, with those in favor as well as the naysayers laying out strong arguments. These names are too appealing for the risk-tolerant investor to ignore. Given the low prices, you get more for your money. On top of this, even minor share price appreciation can translate to massive percentage gains, and thus, major returns for investors. However, there is a but here. The critics point out that there could be a reason for the bargain price tag, whether it be poor fundamentals or overpowering headwinds. Based on the above, weeding out the long-term underperformers from the penny stocks going for gold can pose a significant challenge. In this case, the activity of legendary stock pickers can provide some inspiration. Enter billionaire Steven Cohen. The legendary stock picker, who began his investing career at Gruntal & Co. where he managed proprietary capital for 14 years, founded S.A.C Capital Advisors in 1992. In 2014, his investment operations were converted to Point72 Asset Management, a 1,500-plus person registered investment advising firm. Throughout his career, Cohen has consistently delivered huge returns to clients, giving the Point72 Chairman, CEO and President guru-like status on the Street. Turning to Cohen for inspiration, we took a closer look at two penny stocks Cohen’s Point72 made moves on recently. Using TipRanks’ database to find out what the analyst community has to say, we learned that each ticker boasts a “Strong Buy” consensus rating from the analyst community and massive upside potential. X4 Pharmaceuticals (XFOR) We’ll start with late-stage biopharma company X4. This firm is working on new orally dosed medications for a variety of rare diseases, mainly primary immunodeficiency conditions. The company is targeting the CRCX4 pathway in its research, as this is an important chemokine pathway, a class of molecular interactions that can stimulate cell migrations – especially of the white blood cells so important to immune function. This is an important distinction for the company’s primary drug candidate, mavorixafor, which offers potential, through its mode of action, to become a broad-based treatment for primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs). The drug is currently undergoing several clinical trials, including a Phase 3 trial in the treatment of WHIM syndrome (warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis). There are currently no approved or effective treatments for WHIM. In its earlier clinical trials, X4 has shown that mavorixafor demonstrated clinically significant effect in treatment, as well as a tolerable safety profile. The Phase 3 trial completed enrollment of 31 adult and pediatric patients this past October – the trial was originally designed to 18 patients, so the over-enrollment offers a chance for additional data – and top line data is expected in 4Q22. Mavorixafor is also undergoing two Phase 1 trials, in the treatment of chronic neutropenia and in the treatment of Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (WM). The Phase 1 trial on WM has 16 patients enrolled in a dose escalation study, with data expected later this year. Cohen is among those that have high hopes for this healthcare name. Pulling the trigger on X4 for the first time, Point72 purchased more than 1.6 million shares in Q4. The value of the firm’s new holding comes in at over $2.4 million. In coverage for Roth Capital, analyst Zegbeh Jallah points out the high potential of mavorixafor, and writes: “There remains a large unmet need for convenient, chronically dosed therapies, and Mavorixafor could be the holy-grail, being a safe, effective, and convenient option, which physicians are likely to prescribe, decreasing treatment burden and improving patients' quality-of-life. Moreover, a significant advantage of Mavorixafor is that it specifically targets CXCR4, a master regulator of the immune system, thus addressing the root cause of many diseases including WHIM, Waldenstrom, SCN and other PIDs, by increasing white blood cell counts across the board…” ""Overall,"" the analyst added, ""We see a place for Mavorixafor, and ongoing precommercial efforts, which include patient identification, patient diagnostics, U.S. payer research and the intent to hire a CCO in 2022, has us optimistic about its commercial outlook... Mavorixafor seems very appealing from a payer and physician perspective, and approval in WHIM as the initial indication could significantly de-risk its approval in other indications."" To this end, Jallah rates XFOR a Buy, based on his opinion of the lead candidates broad-based potential, and sets a price target of $28, suggesting an enormous upside of 1,766% from current levels. (To watch Jallah’s track record, click here) Overall, 4 Buys and no Holds or Sells have been assigned in the last three months. Therefore, the analyst consensus is a Strong Buy. The shares are priced at just $1.50 each, but the average price target of $17.25 implies a 1,050% upside in the next 12 months. (See X4 stock forecast on TipRanks) Harpoon Therapeutics (HARP) The second stock we’ll look at is another biopharma company, Harpoon Therapeutics. Harpoon is focused on clinical stage immunotherapies, developing T cell based medications for use in the treatment of various cancers. The company has a proprietary development platform, called Tri-specific T cell Activating Construct (TriTAC), with which it is creating an active pipeline featuring five drug candidates and three early discovery tracks. The company’s four leading drug candidates are at the Phase 1 clinical trial stage, where they are being investigated as treatments for small cell lung cancer, multiple myeloma, ovarian cancer, and prostate cancer. These are serious cancers, with relatively few effective treatments, and large potential patient bases. In a clinical program update released last month, Harpoon noted that the leading candidate, HPN328, is continuing in the dose escalation portion of the trial. The company aims to have an RP2D determination – that is, an appropriate dose for the expansion stage of the trial – by the end of this year. HPN328 is a potential treatment for small cell lung cancer. The next trial, of HPN217 for the dangerous hematological cancer multiple myeloma, is also nearing completion of the dose escalation stage. Harpoon is working on selecting the RP2D, and aims to initial the dose expansion cohort of the trial during 1H22. Finally, HPN536 and HPN424, which are under investigation as treatments for ovarian cancer and prostate cancer respectively, are both undergoing dose escalation studies with completion expected by the end of 2022. Harpoon has another drug candidate, HPN601, a possible treatment for GI cancers, which is ready to enter the clinical pipeline. The Investigational New Drug (IND) application is expected to be completed for submission by year’s end. With such an active pipeline, it’s no wonder that Harpoon attracted an investor of Steve Cohen’s caliber. Cohen’s Point72 put $2.66 million into the company, to buy up 650,000 shares in Q4. Cohen isn’t the only one bullish here. Truist analyst Asthika Goonewardene gives HARP a Buy rating, with a $16 price target that suggests room for 290% growth in the coming 12 months. (To watch Goonewardene’s track record, click here) Backing this stance, Goonewardene sees HPN328 as the key, and writes: “After seeing the first look at HPN328 in December, where it achieved 1 confirmed PR (in a SCLC patient dose-increased from 1215µg to 3600µg), and 3 more pts with 21%-38% tumor reduction, we are more positive on the asset, especially given no Gr3+ CRS was reported... Updates from Amgen's R&D day [also] bode well for Harpoon's HPN328, in our view. This gives us hope that HPN328 can also show deep responses and clinically meaningful durability in late-line small cell lung cancer (SCLC) - a brutal disease with typically poor outcomes."" ""During our catch up... management stated that they will 'no doubt' have additional data this year (targeting a presentation at a medical meeting rather than their planned R&D day), although they were not sure if it would be a 1H or 2H release,"" the analyst added. Overall, Harpoon gets a Strong Buy from the consensus of Wall Street’s analysts, and it’s unanimous, based on 4 positive reviews. The stock is priced at $4.10, with an average target, $27.33, that implies a one-year upside potential of ~575%.

3/3/2022,"Every investor wants to cut through the noise, and clear away the static of the market signals, but there are thousands of companies trading on the markets, and they put out all sorts of signs regarding their health, viability, and potential for success. Top investors will learn how to cut through that confusion to find that stock that are flashing the right signs – and show the highest potential for gains going forward. A clear signal is needed, and one of the clearest is the pattern of insider buying. Insiders – the corporate officers, board members, and others ‘in the know’ – don’t just manage the companies, they know the details. Legally, they are not supposed to trade that knowledge, or to blatantly trade on it, and disclosure rules by government regulators help to keep the insiders honest. Their honest stock transactions, however, can be highly informative. These are the people with the deepest knowledge of particular stocks. So, when they buy or sell, especially in bulk, take note. With the TipRanks Insiders’ Hot Stocks tool, retail investors can get a look at what these company bigwigs are doing in the market. The tools' filters let you sort insider trades through a variety of strategies, to find the rights ones to follow. We’ve gotten the process started, using the tool to find two stocks with Strong Buy rating from the analyst community, plenty of upside potential, and recent strong insider buys. Let's take a closer look. KKR & Co. (KKR) We’ll start with KKR, a financial services company in the global investment sector. KKR offers asset management services to a worldwide clientele, and currently has over $73 billion put into 110 revenue-generating company investments in its portfolio, and over $470 million in assets under management. In 2021, assets under management rose an impressive 87% from 2020. KKR’s portfolio has been successful at generating returns for the company and its shareholders. Total revenues in 2020 came in at $4.43 billion; in 2021, that sum jumped to $16.24 billion, increasing by nearly a factor of 4. Fourth quarter revenues alone reached approximately $4 billion. Some $2 billion of that was fee-related income, which rose 54% year-over-year. In all, it was a record year for the company. The company also saw solid distributable earnings for the quarter, at $1.4 billion. This is the metric that feeds the dividend, and is watched closely by investors. While the dividend of 14.5 cents per common share yields only 0.9%, it is reliable, and KKR has been growing it steadily over the past three years. Insider sentiment on KKR is positive, pushed that way by two recent ‘informative buys’ from Board member Matt Cohler. Cohler was appointed to the company Board in January of this year, and in the last week of February he purchased two tranches of stock in the company, one of 8,305 shares and another of 8,683 shares. Cohler spent a combined total of $999,296 on the buys. While KKR shares are down in recent months, JMP analyst Devin Ryan sees this as an advantage, writing: “We believe the sell-off creates an attractive longer-term buying opportunity, particularly given the strength of the underlying business trends (nearly every relevant metric across the company is at a record). The firm will be in the market fundraising for 30+ strategies in 2022, which we estimate could drive ~$70-$80B of inflows (following $121B of capital raised in 2021), while QTD realizations already stand at $700M+, a level we view quite positively given we’re only about five weeks into the quarter. Bottom line, we believe that KKR continues to execute at a high level and that momentum remains quite elevated heading into 2022.” In line with these bullish comments, Ryan rates KKR an Outperform (i.e. Buy), with a $92 price target that suggests an upside of 53% this year.

The shares are priced at $57.75 and have an average target of $87.44, for ~45% one-year upside. (See KKR stock forecast on TipRanks) Doma Holdings (DOMA) The second company we’ll look at, Doma, brings AI and machine learning tech to the real estate business. The company uses its tech solutions to streamline the closing mechanisms of real estate sales, bringing the ‘1890s process and 1990s technology’ up to date. Doma makes closing efficient and affordable, and reduces the processing time for title and escrow completions from days to minutes. This unique real estate tech firm went public on Wall Street last summer, completing a SPAC merger with Capital Investment Corporation V on July 28. The DOMA ticker debuted on the market on July 29, and the company was able to realize $350 million in new capital from the business combination. The shares are down 67% since the SPAC, a drop that includes a 29% loss recorded after the 4Q21 earnings release. That release showed the company’s third straight EPS loss as a public entity, and was said to have spooked investors. For the full year 2021, the EPS loss came to 64 cents, deeper than the 56-cent loss reported in 2020. Doma expects to achieve profitability in 2023. Despite this somewhat gloomy picture of the stock, at least one insider was willing to put some serious coin on Doma. In an informative buy, Board member Mark Ein paid $799,128 to pick up over 332,000 shares. This stock has its fans among the analysts as well. JMP analyst Matthew Carletti rates DOMA an Outperform (i.e. Buy), along with a $10 price target. Investors stand to pocket ~288% gain should the analyst's thesis play out. (To watch Carletti’s track record, click here) Backing his stance, Carletti writes: ""With the significant pullback in both the share price of DOMA as well as Insur/PropTech peers, we think it is also now constructive to look at the valuation of shares of DOMA in relation to the incumbent title insurer universe, from which we believe DOMA will take significant market share in coming years."" “Despite macro headwinds in the marketplace as volumes for both refinance transactions, and to a lesser extent purchase transactions, have slowed, Doma’s open order volume growth – a leading indicator for revenue – increased 21% yr/yr (+41% in 3Q, +36% in 2Q, and +24% in 1Q), illustrating to us that Doma’s faster, better, cheaper value proposition continues to resonate in the market place and should allow the company to continue to gain market share, even in a contracting macro environment,” the analyst added. In general, the rest of the Street has an optimistic view of DOMA. The stock’s Strong Buy status comes from the 3 Buys and 1 Hold issued over the previous three months. Shares in DOMA are selling for $2.58 each, and the average target of $7.50 indicates a possible upside of ~191% from that level.
