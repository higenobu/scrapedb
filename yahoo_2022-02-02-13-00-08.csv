2/2/2022,"Whoopi Goldberg has been suspended from “The View” for two weeks after facing wide criticism for her remarks that the Holocaust was “not about race.” Goldberg’s suspension was announced in a statement released by ABC News public relations on Tuesday night.

The entire ABC News organization stands in solidarity with our Jewish colleagues, friends, family and communities.” pic.twitter.com/UlX5jT8lOg — ABC News PR (@ABCNewsPR) February 2, 2022 Goldberg’s comments on “The View” reached the highest level of decision makers at Disney, Variety can confirm. According to sources, Peter Rice, the chairman of Disney General Entertainment Content, was consulted on the public fallout for Goldberg. Goldberg’s remarks emerged during a conversation on Monday’s broadcast of “The View,” in which the co-hosts discussed a Tennessee school board’s ban of “Maus,” a nonfiction graphic novel about cartoonist Art Spiegelman’s father’s experience surviving the Holocaust. “Let’s be truthful about it because [the] Holocaust isn’t about race,” Goldberg said on Monday’s episode. “It’s not about race. It’s about man’s inhumanity to man.” The remarks drew immediate, sweeping criticism from Jewish organizations, including the Anti-Defamation League and the U.S. Holocaust Museum. Whoopi Goldberg is apologizing for comments she made claiming that the Holocaust wasn't about race on Monday's episode of ""The View."" Her comments came from the show's ""Hot Topics"" segment, where the paneldiscussed the banning of the graphic novel ""Mauz."" At one point during the discussion, Goldberg stated, ""Let’s be truthful about it, because the Holocaust isn’t about race. No. It’s not about race."" Goldberg now says that she ""misspoke"" and that the Holocaust is ""indeed about race."" “The Holocaust was about the Nazi’s systemic annihilation of the Jewish people — who they deemed to be an inferior race,” wrote Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League. “They dehumanized them and used their racist propaganda to justify slaughtering 6 million Jews. Holocaust distortion is dangerous.” Later Monday, Goldberg apologized for her remarks on social media. She then offered an on-air apology on Tuesday’s episode of “The View.” Greenblatt also appeared as a guest on the broadcast. “So yesterday on our show, I misspoke,” Goldberg said at the top of the show. “I said that the Holocaust wasn’t about race and it was instead about man’s inhumanity to man. But it is indeed about race, because Hitler and the Nazis considered the Jews to be an inferior race. Now, words matter and mine are no exception. I regret my comments as I said and I stand corrected. I also stand with the Jewish people, as they know, and as you all know because I’ve always done that.” Best of Variety What's Coming to Disney Plus in February 2022 Everything Coming to Netflix in February 2022 2022 Oscars Predictions: The Collective - Where Does the Race Stand After a Super Tuesday of Guild Nominations?

2/2/2022,"In a new propaganda video, North Korea appeared to address rumors of ailing health that have dogged dictator Kim Jong Un. The video said Kim, who has at times vanished from public view and lost a significant amount of weight, was “completely withered away,” according to independent news and analysis website North Korea News. The TV special included footage of Kim “struggling to walk down a set of stairs,” and reporter Colin Zwirko shared a clip showing the dictator with a noticeable limp: Both NK News and Voice of America noted that the documentary did not admit to any health problems but said his issues were due to how hard he was working. Kim has sporadically faced rumors of ill health since he took power in 2012, and has at various points also walked with a limp. The new film was released amid escalating tensions in the region after North Korea conducted a series of provocative missile launches, including a launch on Sunday believed to have been the pariah nation’s most powerful missile tested in five years.

2/2/2022,"MILLTOWN – The borough's popular Groundhog Day festivities were canceled this year following the death of the latest local celebrity, who for the last several years has been given the task of predicting whether there will be an early spring or six more weeks of winter. ""We Wranglers are sad to report that Milltown Mel recently crossed over the rainbow bridge. Considering the average lifespan of a Groundhog is about three years, that is not such a shock, but Mel left us at a tough time of year, when most of his fellow groundhogs are hibernating ... so no babies will be available to replace him until this Spring. We tried everywhere to get a stand-in, but to no avail,"" according to a post on Milltown Mel's Facebook page. The post goes on to say, ""the county is not currently renting out the big Showmobile stage due to the pandemic, so we would have had that issue as well. We will work hard on getting us a new weather prognosticator for next year, till then please check out what all of Mel's cousins have to say on Feb 2nd."" An enthusiastic crowd traditionally gathers each year early on Feb. 2 outside the Joyce Kilmer American Legion Post 25 to help the Wranglers rouse Mel from his sleep to hear his much-anticipated prediction. Tradition has it if Mel doesn't see his shadow, early spring is sure to come. The tradition was started by former residents Jerry and Kathy Guthlein, who are the former owners of Bronson and Guthlein Funeral Home. In a 2015 interview with MyCentralJersey.com, Jerry Guthlein said the couple are fans of the movie “Groundhog Day,” the movie in which actor Bill Murray’s character keeps experiencing the same events, and after visiting Punxsutawney Phil they were hooked. Groundhog Day was originally held on the grounds of the funeral home but was later relocated to accommodate the crowd. The current owner of the funeral home, John McNamara, along with the Wranglers, have been carrying on the tradition. Last year, Milltown Mel spent Groundhog Day in quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He did take a quick peek outside and predicted an early spring.

2/2/2022,"Weather experts are urging people to stay home if possible starting Wednesday night as a winter storm is forecast to dump up to 1.25 inches of rain on Monroe County, followed by up to 2 inches of sleet and up to 8 inches of snow. “It’s going to be a very impactful storm,” said Sam Lashley, warning coordination meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Indianapolis. More: Why the coming snow and ice could be challenging for road crews -- and how to prepare The NWS expects rain to switch to freezing rain and sleet sometime Wednesday afternoon to evening. For much of Wednesday night through Thursday, Monroe County will see a mix of freezing rain, sleet and snow. Lashley told The Herald-Times parts of the county could see sleet accumulations of up to 2 inches, which is rare. He urged people to avoid travel starting Wednesday evening. “It’s going to be a mess through the end of the day Thursday,” he said. “Staying at home is the best course of action.” Precipitation will switch to snow Thursday morning and will be heavy at times, along with strong wind and gusts of up to 30 mph, Lashley said. He projected snowfall of 6-8 inches, with the larger accumulation expected for northern parts of the county. Temperatures are expected to drop into the single digits Friday night into Saturday. Lashley said the low temperatures will quickly harden the snow, which, accompanied by the earlier freezing rain and sleet, will make shoveling difficult. “It’s not going to be an easy system to deal with,” he said.

2/2/2022,"You know how opponents of public health, and also, apparently, of good sense and long lives, always pretend that it’s just mandates they oppose, rather than lifesaving COVID-19 vaccines themselves? Then how is it that Missouri Republicans have blocked the state Senate confirmation of our new state health director? He’s out because, though he does not even support mandates, he does want folks to protect themselves against the pandemic. Donald Kauerauf, the former Illinois public health official who’s been our acting health director since September, won’t be confirmed now. As The Star’s news story put it, he’s lost his job “over the perception that he was pressing too hard for vaccination.” Can’t have that. Parson could and should resubmit his nomination next week, but isn’t doing that. Because he won’t stand up against the misinformation that’s killing Missourians, that’s why. Instead, he buckled to a couple of extremists egged on by the 100 or so chowder heads who showed up waving signs this week. “PARSONS HAS GONE COMMIE,” one of them said, while another compared public health measures to slavery. Kauerauf was also thought to be suspect, no joke, because he worked for many years in Illinois, a blue state. His priorities were improving Missouri’s dismal health outcomes and access to primary care. This display of cowardice from Republicans including the governor will delay those goals. And what public health official who believes in public health would even want the job now? Parson’s tweeted Monday defense of his nominee was almost as goofy as the criticism: He lauded Kauerauf as someone with “a disciplined moral compass that is guided by our Missouri principles: Christian values, family values, and love for this nation.” Which is all fine, but beside the point. And aren’t Jewish and Muslim and other values, religious and secular, “Missouri principles,” too? Think you just named a state religion, Governor, and James Madison would like a word. Far-right state Sen. Mike Moon, who is running for Congress, has been Kauerauf’s chief critic, objecting with particular heat to the acting director’s comment that he’d like to see all Missourians vaccinated. Moon also said that Kauerauf, who self-identifies as pro-life, isn’t pro-life enough. But putting a distinguished public servant out on the street for trying to save lives is? After Kauerauf’s immediate resignation, Parson put out a statement lamenting “that we now have to disrupt state operations and the leadership at an entire department because the Missouri Senate chose to indulge a few men’s egos. The events that have transpired over the past few days surrounding Don’s Senate confirmation hearing are nothing short of disgraceful, unquestionably wrong, and an embarrassment to this state and the people we serve.” Absolutely true, Governor. Which is why you should have stood up to these lies about COVID a couple of years ago. Instead, you indulged them, and this is the result.",Politics/Kansas City Star,Parson eaten by his pet monster: Missouri health director out for being pro-vaccine,https://news.yahoo.com/parson-eaten-pet-monster-missouri-234742524.html
2/2/2022,"APPLETON - A chaotic scene erupted in a packed courtroom late Tuesday afternoon after a teenager was sentenced to 40 years in prison for a shooting last year at the Fox River Mall that left one person dead and another wounded. After Outagamie County Judge Mark McGinnis announced 18-year-old Dezman Ellis' sentence, multiple people in the gallery began to yell and physically confront each other, leading police to escort many of them out of the courtroom. Several police vehicles with flashing lights remained outside the courthouse after the hearing concluded. Ellis was charged in connection with a shooting that happened about 3:30 p.m. Jan. 31, 2021 — a year ago Monday — near the food court inside the Fox River Mall and led to the death of Jovanni Frausto, a 19-year-old from Neenah. In November, Ellis pleaded no contest to two charges related to the incident: second-degree intentional homicide and first-degree recklessly endangering safety. Ellis had faced a more serious homicide charge, but prosecutors agreed to amend it before he entered his plea. After a hearing that lasted for about four hours, McGinnis sentenced Ellis to a total of 40 years of initial confinement, followed by 25 years of extended supervision. ""There is no doubt in my mind that the community at large needs to be protected from you,"" McGinnis said. RELATED: Dezman Ellis, 18, convicted of homicide charge for deadly shooting at Fox River Mall RELATED: Fox River Mall shooting suspect held on $1.5 million cash bond after emotional plea from victim’s mother in court Ellis stood in front of the courtroom before he was sentenced and, speaking quickly, apologized for his actions. ""I made a mistake that I regret,"" he said. ""I'm going to regret it for the rest of my life."" Ellis, who has already spent about a year in jail, said he hoped Frausto's family might someday be able to forgive him. ""I messed up,"" he said. ""I wish I could take it all back."" Earlier in the afternoon, many of Frausto's relatives gave statements in court, including his mother, Tanya Lopez, who carried with her a framed photo of her and her children, which she showed to McGinnis. ""This hurts me to my core,"" said Lopez, describing how the loss of her son has affected her life. ""I literally feel heartache every day."" The bystander wounded in the shooting also spoke in court, describing the challenges he has faced since the incident, including difficulty trusting people and trouble sleeping at night. ""Every little sound I hear, I jump now,"" he said. Outagamie County District Attorney Melinda Tempelis stressed how the incident affected the entire community as she gave her sentencing recommendation. ""The impact to the community was huge,"" said Tempelis, describing the crowds of people who fled the mall, unsure what was happening, and others forced to hide for hours as police responded to the incident. Ellis' defense attorney, Scott Ceman, said Ellis didn't go to the mall with a plan to hurt anyone, but was instead worried about his own safety when he opened fire. Frausto made several threats toward Ellis in the months before the incident that made Ellis fearful for his own life, Ceman said. Still, Ellis accepts responsibility for what happened, Ceman said. ""He understands what he has done wrong,"" he said. When shots rang out inside the mall that afternoon, crowds of people fled the building or found places to hide as police swarmed the area. Ellis and Frausto were both at the mall in separate groups of friends, but began to ""exchange words,"" apparently about a girl in Ellis' group who used to talk to Frausto, according to a criminal complaint. Ellis told Frausto, ""I will shoot this place up, I will kill you,"" then displayed a gun before opening fire at Frausto before he fled the mall, the complaint says. The bystander wounded by one of Ellis' shots told police he had been talking to a friend when he heard a voice say ""drop the gun."" He then heard a shot and felt something hit him in the hip, the complaint says. Police found two spent shell casings at the scene, the complaint says. An autopsy later determined Frausto died as a result of two gunshot wounds. Contact Chris Mueller at 920-996-7267 or cmueller@gannett.com. Follow him on Twitter at @AtChrisMueller.
