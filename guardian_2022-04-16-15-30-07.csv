4/16/2022,"Ministers will face a fierce battle in parliament over plans to force some asylum seekers to be relocated to Rwanda, a Labour peer and former child refugee has vowed. Alf Dubs, who was brought to Britain from Czechoslovakia on one of the Kindertransport trains in 1939, told the Guardian that the government was trying to “ride roughshod” over international agreements designed to help those seeking sanctuary. After the announcement that many of those who arrived in the UK on small boats from across the Channel would be removed and settled in Rwanda, Dubs said peers would fight against the “awful, shocking decision” when legislation was introduced. “I think it’s a way of getting rid of people the government doesn’t want, dumping them in a distant African country, and they’ll have no chance of getting out of there again,” he said. “I think it’s a breach of the 1951 Geneva conventions on refugees. You can’t just shunt them around like unwanted people.” While Conservative MPs have largely welcomed the policy as a way to try to avoid desperate migrants being exploited by people-trafficking gangs and curtail the record high numbers of crossings, Dubs said there would probably be legal challenges and fierce resistance from fellow peers. He pointed to an amendment to the nationality and borders bill, passed in the House of Lords earlier this month, which said the government could proceed with any offshoring only with the express permission of both chambers in parliament. The amendment is likely to be scrapped when the bill returns to the Commons next week. Asked if the resettlement scheme was ever likely to get off the ground, given the threat of judicial reviews and other court action, Dubs said: “I think it’s unlikely. As soon as they try and remove one person, I’m sure there’ll be a legal challenge, and I’m not sure the government will win it.” Despite the home secretary Priti Patel’s reported boast to Tory MPs that she would stand up to “lefty lawyers”, Dubs said the government appeared “quite happy to ride roughshod” over the UK’s commitments under the Geneva conventions. He continued: “If [Patel] says she’ll get rid of the lefty lawyers’ claims, well, I think she may have another thing coming. My understanding is that they’re going to have real difficulties in getting this through anyway.” Dubs said the legislation needed to put the deal with Rwanda on legal footing would lead to “a battle in parliament”, particularly in the House of Lords. Referring to the process by which the Commons and Lords keep disagreeing and sending bills between them, Dubs added: “No doubt, the government will make us sit and then just ping-pong it through until they think they can wear us down. But I think there will be quite a battle about this.” The bishop of Durham, Paul Butler, who sits in the House of Lords, also vowed to fight the move. “The whole idea of declaring asylum seekers’ claims as inadmissible is wrong,” he told the Guardian. “Where asylum seekers arrive from or how, is irrelevant in international law. It is also wrong to apparently punish those seeking asylum. It is the traffickers who need to be targeted and brought to justice for their terrible crimes.” Butler called on the UK not to “offload our international responsibility on to another nation” – warning this would “effectively be conducting state-sponsored trafficking ourselves if we forcibly remove people from our shores to a nation these asylum seekers do not know and have no wish to go to for consideration as asylum seekers”. Butler agreed with Dubs the project would be “extremely costly” and said the money would be better spent on improving the way asylum seekers’ claims were processed in Britain, and providing further safe and legal routes alongside those that existed for Afghans, Ukrainians and British Nationals Overseas in Hong Kong. The Home Office has said the £120m partnership with Rwanda was necessary because existing approaches had failed and that there was no single solution to tackling migrant crossings in the Channel. It has praised Rwanda’s “strong experience in supporting and integrating refugees” and said the country was “internationally recognised for its safety, strong governance, low corruption, gender equality and as one of the fastest growing economies across Africa”.",News/UK news,"Peers will fight UK government’s ‘awful’ Rwanda plans, says Lord Dubs",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/16/peers-will-fight-uk-governments-awful-rwanda-plans-says-lord-dubs
4/16/2022,"The head of Australia’s peak medical body will meet with the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, to urge him to reconsider his “small target” strategy on health. Dr Omar Khorshid will warn that substantial funding is urgently needed to address the crisis in the country’s hospitals. The message from the Australian Medical Association president comes after Albanese called him on Thursday morning in response to the association criticising Labor’s $135m urgent care clinic policy, announced this week, as “incoherent”. Albanese was in the marginal seat of Hunter on Thursday, announcing that one of the 50 clinics would be built in Cessnock to take pressure off the local hospital’s emergency department. Khorshid told Guardian Australia he expected to meet with Albanese and the party’s shadow health minister, Mark Butler, in the coming days about the party’s health platform. He said the association had not been so far consulted on any of Labor’s proposed health policies. He said while the urgent care clinics might be popular with the public, they would not make any difference to the pressure on emergency departments. He added that he would be encouraging Labor to be more “courageous” on the issue of health. In the lead-up to the election, both major parties have told the association they will not commit to the 5% boost to public hospital funding being demanded by states as they deal with a “logjam” of patients – leading to ambulance ramping, and patients unable to be admitted for treatment. This 5% funding boost, which would lift the commonwealth’s share of public hospital funding to 50%, would cost about $5bn a year. “50-50 hospital funding has not been accepted by either party as part of their platforms, and we’ve pushed it hard with both and we’ve had ‘noes’ from both so far,” Khorshid told Guardian Australia. “We’re not giving up just yet – which is why we’re doing all this work, because we think it’s a no-brainer, basically. And the states agree with us, so we’ll keep pushing … But at this stage, we’re not expecting it to be part of either party’s announcements.” Khorshid added that Labor had still not told the AMA what the party would be doing. “But I’m pretty sure it won’t include 50-50, unless we are amazingly successful in the next few days,” he said. “Neither party is interested.” Khorshid said he would be asking Albanese – who has been pursuing a small target strategy, eschewing the multibillion policies Labor took to the last election – to “stand for health”. “We have not seen their vision for healthcare; we have seen a few small, piecemeal announcements,” he said. “We’re hoping that that will be a broad vision tackling the real problems, rather than a clinic here, a small thing there: marginal, seat-focused campaigns which might win elections, but won’t fix the health system. “If [Albanese] can actually show that he stands for health, rather than spin and manipulating numbers and all this other stuff that the pollies normally do, [he needs to) actually stand up and say, ‘We will pay for it and we will find a way to pay for it.’” Khorshid said that without the urgent injection of federal funds, which the AMA has said should be directed to increasing state hospital capacity, the crisis gripping Australia’s hospitals will worsen. He warned this would be exacerbated by a surge in unmet demand for surgery which had been postponed as a result of the pandemic, as well as an ageing demographic. “We’ll see a situation where you basically can’t access low-urgency elective surgery in public hospitals. You’ll just have to go private if you want a cataract or a hip replacement,” Khorshid said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “With ED performance, you’ll see people unnecessarily dying in the back of ambulances or in ED waiting rooms – which we’re already seeing right now. We are going to see that more and more. “I think it actually won’t be allowed to deteriorate much more than it is at the moment because it’ll just be untenable. How can you justify watching people die in emergency departments when you could do something about it? It’s at your fingers, the solution. “I think it’ll just get so bad that eventually the crisis will create a response. But let’s get in there now, because we’ve got plenty of indicators and almost no disagreement.” The call comes as ambulance ramping becomes an increasing problem for state governments, with the new South Australian Labor premier, Peter Malinauskas, winning the recent election largely on his commitment to fix the ramping crisis in the state. The Queensland government has also called for the federal government to commit to the 50-50 funding pledge. It is also under pressure about the growing issue of hospital ramping, with reports this week of 000 calls going unanswered.

4/16/2022,"Homebuyers and those looking to remortgage were this week being urged to act fast if they want to lock in a competitive home loan deal. Many banks and building societies have been pulling their mortgage deals or repricing them upwards, often at very short notice, as they grapple with rising interest rates and inflation, and the wider economic volatility. Many economists reckon the news this week that inflation has hit 7% puts more pressure on the Bank of England to hike interest rates rapidly. But at the same time, some odd things going on with fixed-rate mortgage pricing suggest some lenders think a sharp economic slowdown may be coming down the tracks that means the Bank would need to stop putting interest rates up or even cut them in the future. That could leave some people on the hunt for a fixed-rate mortgage facing a dilemma: do you sign up for a longer-term fix – five or even 10 years – on the basis that this will protect you from the economic “storms” for longer, or do you go for a shorter-term deal – two years, say – so you are free to hop on to another loan if rates drop in maybe two years? Ultimately it will be down to individual circumstances and things such as how tight your finances are. What’s not in doubt is that many mortgage deals are getting pricier, and lenders are also starting to tighten their affordability tests because of the cost of living crisis, which may mean some borrowers can’t borrow as much as they would like – so that’s two reasons why it’s a good idea to act speedily if you can. Financial data provider Moneyfacts this week said the average two-year fixed-rate mortgage on sale in April was priced at 2.86% – up from 2.65% in March, and the highest figure since 2015. Meanwhile, the average five-year fix rose from 2.88% to 3.01%. Eleanor Williams at Moneyfacts says: “Those hoping to secure a new mortgage may wish to act sooner rather than later.” Lloyds Bank this week launched ads to promote its new 10-year fixed rate aimed at those looking for long-term security. The headline rate is 2.23%, which was table-topping, but the maximum loan-to-value (LTV) for that rate is 60%, which will rule out many people. Those looking to borrow, say, 90% of the property’s value will pay quite a bit more. For example, Virgin Money has a 10-year fix at 3.99%. In terms of two-year fixes, rates start at 1.75% (Hanley Economic building society) to 1.79% (Cumberland building society). These were two of the best rates available on Thursday. Not only are the rates on offer increasing, but the best deals are becoming harder for borrowers to grab as they don’t hang around for long, says Williams. This month, the average “shelf life” of new mortgages fell to just 21 days. Chris Sykes at the mortgage broker Private Finance says the cost of short-term borrowing and long-term borrowing has converged, with only 0.15% separating the best two-year fixed rate from the best 10-year fixed rate earlier this week. “We are seeing an increasing number of clients opt for longer fixed terms of five years and up,” he adds. Sykes says there has been a fundamental shift in the interest rate environment, from one where it made sense to take the shortest-term mortgage possible as it was highly likely a cheaper rate would be available when you came to remortgage, to one where rates are rising and it’s possible the Bank of England base rate could catch up with the best available rates today in a year or two. Samantha Bickford, a mortgage specialist at Clarity Wealth Management, says that “another interest rate rise, and soon, is inevitable … For those due to remortgage soon, don’t delay”. She says her advice would be to secure a longer-term fixed rate now, while you can, “to ride out the mortgage market storm that is brewing”. Amanda Aumonier at online mortgage broker Trussle says many lenders are clearly betting on an economic downturn impacting the property market. However, she adds that borrowers should be aware that “we will likely see rates increase further before any potential decrease”.",Lifestyle/Money,Looking for a mortgage?

4/16/2022,"In the sharp and smart new Channel 4 comedy-drama Chivalry, written by Steve Coogan and Sarah Solemani, the acclaimed feminist director Bobby (Solemani), who has to work with Cameron, a classic chauvinist studio boss (Coogan, in a classic Coogan role), explains why her progress in the film industry has been so slow compared with her contemporaries: “I’ve been hacking through this jungle that the most average man can stroll into,” she says with feeling. “Steve came up with that line, actually,” Solemani, 39, tells me over a breakfast of brisket and scrambled eggs in a deli around the corner from her home in Los Angeles. I’d assumed she’d written it, because she herself has been hacking through the jungle of British TV and film for two decades, to the point where she considered writing her memoir just to title it “Nearly”. “Because it was always TV commissioners telling me, ‘Right, this is so nearly what we want, but … ’” she says. Over the years, she has been pitched by magazines and the TV industry as “the new Lena Dunham”, “the new Amy Schumer”, “the new [insert any big-name female comedian]”, only to then be told by British TV bosses that she was nearly what they wanted, but not quite. Not that she was unsuccessful: she starred in sitcoms including Him & Her with Russell Tovey (2010-13), Bad Education with Jack Whitehall (2012–14) and The Wrong Mans with James Corden (2013–14); she had a flashy film role as Bridget’s best friend in Bridget Jones’s Baby (2016), and she adapted Jo Bloom’s novel Ridley Road, about British fascism in the 1960s, which was screened on BBC One last autumn. But around and in between these gigs, there was, she says, “a lot” of rejection. “A toxic culture still exists in the industry; one in which the artistic potential of half the human race is constantly undermined,” she wrote in the Guardian in 2017 in the wake of #MeToo. Once, she and the writer and actor Olivia Poulet (The Thick of It) wrote a script, but a TV commissioner told them: “I know I asked for something a bit female, but this seems a bit too female.” “I’ve got that note somewhere,” Solemani says in the tone of one who has kept all of her receipts. I say that it’s interesting that all of the sitcoms she starred in were created by men. Her eyes widen, and she makes an emphatic “believe me, I noticed” nod. Solemani grew up in London and moved to Los Angeles six years ago. She has a nice mix of British candour and Californian earnest optimism that slips occasionally into light LA woo-woo-ness (we take a brief detour into the importance of “celebrating oneself, like, ‘I did a good show’, ‘I did a good bedtime with the kids …’”). She is a longtime campaigner for the decriminalisation of sex work, and in 2016, when she turned up for the premiere of Bridget Jones’s Baby, she carried a placard demanding creches on film sets. Coogan is no slouch when it comes to campaigning either, having taken on the British tabloids in the phone-hacking scandal. But his reputation as what people used to call a roué precedes him on both sides of the Atlantic, and he was once cited by Courtney Love, of all people, “one of my life’s great shames”, along with crack cocaine. In Chivalry, he and Solemani have the same enjoyable odd-couple dynamic as Coogan’s collaborations with Rob Brydon on The Trip. That Coogan wrote that particular line about how much harder it is for women in the entertainment business suggests Chivalry was as successful behind the scenes as it is on screen at “engaging in a dialectic”, as Solemani puts it. “Now in the culture, people don’t talk to each other. We announce our standpoint, we shout at opposing views and we affirm each other’s politics. We don’t have the kind of gritty debate that makes you question your viewpoint, and that’s what Steve and I both wanted in the show,” she says. Solemani spent years getting rejected, whereas Coogan, she says, “has been famous and rich for most of his adult life – he even had a statue in Norfolk”. Did working so closely with her make him question some of his experiences? “I think that’s for him to say,” she says carefully. “But that journey is definitely in the show.” Chivalry opens with Bobby reluctantly taking over a film project after the previous director – a sexist of the old school – dies, and she tries to remake it as a little more female-friendly. The show has been described as a #MeToo satire, but that’s a description that makes Solemani wince. Because it doesn’t explain what the show is satirising? “Yes, exactly,” she says. “And that was one of our challenges. We were constantly walking this tightrope between wanting to give something to everyone in the audience – from the most woke feminist to some old dinosaur – but without minimising what the movement was, which was a declaration of systemic abuse of women.” Far be it from me to punch up a comedy writer’s words, but this description does not make Chivalry sound like a barrel of laughs. In fact, it is very funny, and more nuanced than I was expecting. The show satirises the extremes on both sides, from Cameron describing his twentysomething assistant as “the love of his life” but admitting he doesn’t know her birthday, to the actor who gets intense counselling from the set’s intimacy supervisor (Aisling Bea) to cope with a sex scene, while the initially supportive Bobby rolls her eyes impatiently. Eventually, she pushes the intimacy supervisor aside so she can just finish the damn scene. “Don’t feel like you’ve betrayed the movement,” Cameron says consolingly, much to Bobby’s irritation. What makes this scene even more interesting is that Solemani has written in the past that she felt deeply exploited when acting in sex scenes. Chivalry shows the occasional tension between not treating actors like pieces of meat, but also needing them to do their job. “There’s a lot of hypocrisy running through the show, and we wanted the characters to navigate that,” Solemani says. The show is far more nuanced than most discussions of #MeToo, let alone most sitcoms that look at battles between the sexes. Coogan and Solemani have been engaging in a dialectic about the #MeToo movement since 2019, when they were on the set of the Michael Winterbottom film Greed, in which Coogan plays a Philip Green-like tyrant and Solemani plays one of his minions. Coogan was aware of her feminism and so, she says, “he would totally wind me up” about the #MeToo movement. In what way? She hesitates to answer, cautious again. Would he say, “So am I still allowed to say this? Or do this?” “Yeah, yeah, all of that,” she says. Was Solemani the only one on set willing to spar with Coogan, given that he was the star of the film and the power dynamics that comes with? She pauses and then answers carefully: “I think on every set there’s a hierarchy, and maybe people who have been number one on a call sheet for a lot of their lives, maybe they forget that hierarchy exists. But he’s actually very good with actors, so it wasn’t like no one could talk to him. So no, I wouldn’t say I had bravery to stand up to him that no one else did,” she says. I ask how they made the move from debating #MeToo over lunch to thinking, “Hey, this could be a really funny sitcom!” “Well, it was just this huge cultural shift, and the intensity of that needed comedy. We came from different perspectives, and a lot of our dialogue was like: ‘It’s gone too far, it’s not organised.’ ‘But a movement never is strategised. It’s going to be messy. That’s what a movement is, and it’s necessary.’ And from that dialectic, we both knew we needed to laugh about it, and off we went,” she says. Solemani has been writing about sexism in the entertainment business for a long time, and has been experiencing it for even longer. When she was 19, she went to a fiftysomething director’s house for what she thought was a work dinner. He asked how she felt about on-screen nudity, and then suggested she strip for him to prove it. She lied and said she had her period. She didn’t get the job. “It was a decade before I realised what an abuse of power this had been, and how I’d normalised it,” she later wrote. After graduating from Cambridge, where she was “the one woman” in the Footlights, she struggled to get a job, whereas the boys she knew – including Simon Bird and Joe Thomas of The Inbetweeners – seemed to soar off effortlessly. She ended up getting a job in a call centre. But since #MeToo, she says, things have changed. “It’s night and day, it really is. I was in a writers’ room and a studio representative came in to explain that if you invite a colleague to lunch, or even dinner, that is a working engagement, nothing more. And I thought, ‘Finally, that behaviour is over.’ I was crying! Some people feel policed, but for women, it feels safe. Plus, there is a greater curiosity [from TV commissioners] about the female experience. Before I used to think, ‘I don’t want to frighten them off with female stuff’, but now I have more shows in my head than I can write.” Solemani’s life looks pretty great now, a far cry from call centres and creepy directors. In 2016, she was hired to write for the HBO show Barry, and so she and her family moved to California. With that credit under her belt, her agent sold several of her old scripts, which had previously been rejected or stuck in development, including Ridley Road. She is visibly bubbling with excitement about all the projects she currently has on the go, none of which she can talk about yet, but one will be a feature film, which she will direct. With the proceeds from her newly sold, once-rejected scripts, she bought a house in one of the prettiest neighbourhoods in LA, around the corner from where we are meeting. Her husband, who works in sustainable investment, and young daughter and son are waiting for her, eager for their Saturday morning trip to the beach. “So I don’t want to spend too much of this interview complaining, because I’m now making everything,” she says with a delighted laugh. I ask if things changed for her because she moved to the US where more projects get made, and she says no, it’s because the times have moved on. Things, she says, have really, really changed. But does she think she could have made a show about a feminist director and the #MeToo movement if Coogan hadn’t been her co-writer? “Oh God, Hadley,” she says, momentarily taken aback by the question. But she quickly finds her footing again. “No, I don’t think I could have because what I wanted was the dialectic … ” Solemani is the older daughter of a father who was raised Orthodox Jewish and a mother who was raised Christian but became an atheist. “I think because they’d grown up with these quite oppressive family structures, they were like this island of resistance together. I remember a really embarrassing time we were on a train in Paris and a guard told them they had to move because a school trip needed their seats, and they staged a protest: ‘No, we will stay! We refuse!’ And all these French people were telling them to move. They really prided themselves on these small acts of resistance.” Her parents instilled a steel rod of self-belief in her. When she was working at the call centre and told her father she was considering giving up on her dreams of writing, he told her: “You mustn’t, because you have talent.” The last thing her mother said to her before she died was: “I don’t know what you’re going to do, but it’s going to be incredible.” Solemani went to one of the top grammar schools in the country, and that also helped to build her ambitions, although she has recently been wondering whether that was a short-term help but long-term hindrance. “The school’s attitude was: ‘You can do anything!’ But that can also sound like: ‘You’d better do something!’ It’s a fine line, and as I’ve got older I’ve wondered whether what serves you to achieving A* GCSEs might not work when you later have to learn how to establish boundaries and decide how much of yourself you’re willing to give,” she says. Her mother was diagnosed with cancer when was 42. Solemani was 12 and her sister was eight. She died four years later. “She was such a brilliant mother, too. So I missed out on that, and I also missed out on having a mother to blame.” The week after her mother died, she was accepted into the National Youth Theatre. Soon, she was playing Elaine in a West End production of The Graduate. “It was such a dark time and my dad was in such agony. I wanted to move into the light, and this was the light,” she says. How does she think that awareness of death from such a young age affected her in the long term? “It’s a big question, and I’m reflecting on it a lot now. I think that’s a classic thing of experiencing mortality. Life is now, it will end. What are you going to do with your time?” Despite her father rejecting his Orthodox upbringing, Solemani says she always “felt Jewish”, even though her family in Israel don’t regard her as such. (Traditionally, Judaism is passed down through the mother.) One of the nice things about moving to the US, she says, is “patrilineal Judaism is recognised. I’m just as Jewish as Barack Obama is black.” Solemani’s husband is Jewish, and the two of them spent four years studying Hebrew, reaffirming their identity. I ask how much that played a part in her writing of Ridley Road. “Loads. I couldn’t have written that show had I not done that intense learning about my faith and had the dual perspective of being an inside outsider, coming from a family that didn’t grow up with Jewish culture,” she says. Like Chivalry, Ridley Road set a fictional story within real social shifts. In it, Vivien (Agnes O’Casey) moves to London’s East End in the early 60s and, with the encouragement of her uncle Soly (Eddie Marsan), she starts a relationship with the (nonfictional) neo-Nazi leader Colin Jordan (Rory Kinnear), in order to spy on him. The reviews were largely positive, but there was some criticism, saying the depictions of British fascism were overblown. “The response to that show really woke me up to antisemitism in Britain, because people would say, ‘It really wasn’t that bad back then.’ Well, it was bad for the Jews who saw Nazis walking in front of their homes. One review which really upset me said Eddie Marsan ‘shouts’ a particular speech. He didn’t shout, he whispered. But there’s something about the Jewish testimony of pain that makes some people assume it’s exaggerated, or they’re being lectured. It was very revealing,” she says. The more I talk to Solemani, the more I can’t figure something out. She’s so smart, so aware of the rights and wrongs of the world. And sure, things are great now, but why did she keep slugging it out in the entertainment business, dealing with prejudiced rejections and lecherous older men for two decades before things finally went her way? Why not just quit and focus on activism? She laughs and says she knows what I mean but she just really, really likes writing. I ask her how she finds living in California. “It’s good, but there have been times when it’s like, ‘Oh my God,’” she says. “During Covid, the schools were closed for a year, and then it was peak Trump incompetence. Then there was this weird plague of mosquitoes and everyone was like, ‘This hasn’t happened for a hundred years.’ Then the fires came and you couldn’t breathe outside, but you also couldn’t meet anyone inside. Then the house started shaking: there was an earthquake. Then I really was like, ‘Why am I here?’” she says, still sounding a little shaky at the memory. She turns around and looks out the window of the diner at the sunny day. The sky is clear blue and the palm trees are barely rustling in the warm breeze. “But, you know, every place has its challenges, and this one really is a place of extremes. And now,” she says with the smile of one who has come through the fire of the pre-#MeToo entertainment world and the fires of southern California, “things are good”.

4/16/2022,"Two days before the Russian invasion, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk received a call from the British ambassador to Ukraine, with a simple message: get out of Kyiv immediately. The call, as Vereshchuk recalled it, was one of a number of warnings made to senior government figures, amid western expectations that the Russian army would swiftly win control of Kyiv and seek to install its own puppet government. “The Americans and British were warning that there’s a kill list, and that the main target is the president and his family, and then members of the government,” said Vereshchuk. “We were told, ‘They will be looking for you, they’ll hunt you down and they will kill you.’ And I said ‘What, they’re going to kill a deputy prime minister on live television? OK, no problem, so we’ll stay here and let the whole world see it,’” she said. The decision to remain in Kyiv began with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. On the second day of the war, he told European leaders on a conference call: “This might be the last time you see me alive,” adding that he had information he was on a Russian hitlist. He also reportedly rejected an offer of evacuation from Kyiv made by the US president, Joe Biden, saying he “needed ammunition, not a ride”. In the first weeks of the war, Russian state media promoted a number of conspiracy theories about Zelenskiy’s location: that the videos showing him in Kyiv were fake and that in fact the Ukrainian leader had fled immediately after the invasion. However, these claims have become more forlorn as evidence mounted he had remained in the capital, and his regular, snappy video addresses have become a huge source of inspiration for many Ukrainians. Vereshchuk said Zelenskiy’s decision to stay behind was one of the first signs that Ukraine was not minded to surrender to the supposed inevitability of Vladimir Putin’s capture of Ukraine, and helped lay the groundwork for the spirited response that led Russia to abandon its push to Kyiv, at least for now. “The Kremlin really hoped that we would be disoriented and would run away … But it was one of the first steps which helped control the situation. Can you imagine that people found out that the president and his team, and the government, had run away? Of course, it would have demoralised everyone,” Vereshchuk said. For other Ukrainian officials in occupied areas, the question of whether to follow Zelenskiy’s lead was a difficult one. Many local mayors and other officials remained in place, sometimes with deadly consequences, while others decided to flee. In a few cases, mayors have expressed willingness to work with the Russians, and may face treason charges if Ukraine regains control over their towns. In the town of Motyzhyn, the mayor, Olha Sukhenko, decided to stary. Together with her husband and son, she was detained by Russian soldiers on 23 March. They were later shot and buried in shallow graves, according to Ukrainian officials. In many occupied towns, there were reports of Russian soldiers going door-to-door looking for those with Ukrainian government links. Ihor Kostovarov, the head of the villages of Staryi and Novyi Bykiv east of Kyiv, said that around the same time Sukhenko was kidnapped, he decided to leave his own village. “We got information from our security services that the Russians were sending in FSB squads to find and execute local officials. I was here for the first three weeks, but after this information, I left,” he said. Kostovarov said many villagers were furious at his decision to leave, making it hard to return to the village after its liberation. Many local officials in other places who made the decision to leave have also come in for criticism. In the Sumy region, which borders Russia and was partially occupied by its troops at the beginning of the war, the governor, Dmytro Zhyvytskyy, claimed that whether or not mayors stayed in place had an effect on the defence of the cities. “Krasnopillia fell because the mayor fled, and Trostianets fell because the mayor fled. There was nobody left to organise the defence,” he claimed, referring to two towns the Russians occupied for a month. Yuriy Bova, the mayor of Trostianets, said he had no choice but to leave the town, saying there were no Ukrainian army units there to defend it, given he had only a few rifles at his disposal to use against the column of Russian tanks that moved on the town on the first day of the invasion. “If I had stayed then most likely I would not be alive and sitting before you today,” said Bova. “Instead, we took the decision to become partisans.” Bova and a group of confidants moved to villages outside the town, he said, and coordinated with residents who had remained and sent coordinates of Russian military positions by telephone. Zhyvytskyy, the regional governor, remained unconvinced, and said he had major questions about Bova’s decision. “You go to Trostianets and everyone you see has aged 15 years in two weeks, and this guy is running around the place looking fresh-faced,” he said. In Melitopol, one of a string of cities in Ukraine’s south occupied by Russian troops without major battles in the first part of the invasion, the mayor, Ivan Fedorov, remained in place but refused to cooperate with the Russian military. Eventually he was marched out of his temporary office with a bag on his head, held for six days and questioned by Russian security services, before being released as part of a prisoner exchange. “If we had left the city immediately, we would have given a gift to the Russians, they would say, ‘Your authorities have run away, we are the new authorities,’” he said. Now, he said, nobody could be in any doubt that Russian rule was only implemented by force. He added, however, that he had some sympathy for those who had made different decisions. “During occupation the main thing is to preserve life, and the people most in danger are the heads of the city. If the city is occupied, what should the mayor do, what should the team do? There was no single algorithm. Nobody gave us any orders. Everyone acted as they felt right,” he said.",News/World news,Stay or go?

4/16/2022,"Bizarre that we just let Simon Cowell, like, do that. We just let him “be Simon Cowell”. There was that decade-long moment that I don’t think we talk about enough where he was the only person seemingly allowed on TV, first the villainous high king of The X Factor, then doing the exact same thing with the American version, then he launched Britain’s Got Talent, then whatever happened to his face happened to his face. We’ve had a fallow few years of Cowell – The X Factor: Celebrity! Imagine thinking that would work! – but the DNA is ever-present and unbreakable: the jeans, the pointy shoes, the Beano haircut, the long-sleeved tee with the arms pulled short, the unblinking dread in his eyes, leaning forward over the desk before saying: “Look, OK? Sure.” My prediction is that we are at the midway point of Cowell. He will be the Bruce Forsyth of being gratuitously mean to average singers from the home counties. We’ll be watching him do it as the Earth is engulfed by the sun. Look, OK? Sure: it’s a new series of Britain’s Got Talent (Saturday, 8pm, ITV), the 15th, and you know exactly what to expect by now. Amanda Holden is there, so dads can go: “What is she talented for again?” while deliriously fancying her. David Walliams will say something saucy and catty that will start an on-air fight, but then become tremendously emotional when a children’s choir sings with perfect pitch. Alesha Dixon is there as the voice of the youth despite being 43 years old, but she’s also intensely likable about it. And then Simon Cowell, the tight-faced vampire king whose ire only softens for dancing dogs. Lurking by a curtain, Ant and Dec pal around in that award-winningly delightful way of theirs. It’s all just nice, isn’t it? Normally, I am fairly critical of nice, but something about Britain’s Got Talent gets to me: here are all these people, with their strange variety acts that they have absolutely nowhere to perform because nobody goes to piers or has loose change for street performers any more, earnestly doing that thing they do. Here’s a gymnast who can tie themselves up like a pretzel. A dog with a great personality runs through cones. Someone too nervous to ever be charismatic on stage absolutely smashes a West End standard. A dance troupe do something bombastic to the kind of remixes you only hear in gyms. Friends who met in the NHS sing a cappella! Five ex-army lads break into operatic song! Alesha Dixon’s standing facing the crowd now, look, swelling them up into a roar. David Walliams is shouting “Come on!” as someone really hits a note. Is Amanda Holden crying a single tear? Well, no, obviously, but she’s at least pretending to. And there Simon Cowell is, on the tips of his Cuban heels, breaking into a slow, astonished clap. The beating mantra that runs through Britain’s Got Talent is: can you believe this? That unglamorous people are capable of doing something amazing? What happens next doesn’t matter: the audition hour-longs are the classic mix of “footage of people queueing”, “a crowd becomes astonished”, “Simon Cowell saying: ‘Well we weren’t expecting that!’”, “Nobody thinks this old man’s ventriloquist act is going to be any good but I guess it’s OK”, “David Walliams feigns fear at a performer swallowing fire or balancing on something precarious”, “a group of children celebrate the honk of a golden buzzer as if Santa himself came down from heaven to award them all a billion pounds”. The live shows are too much of that manufactured ITV pageantry (do I really need to watch Ant and Dec remind us, once again, not to vote until lines open?) but it doesn’t matter because by then you are gripped – no TV channel in this country knows better the dark alchemy it takes to make you fully committed to a reality series by the end of the opening episode – and you’re sending the most expensive text message of your life to ensure those two dancing lads who met driving ambulances make it to the grand final. Pomp, ceremony, the constant threat that they will have to perform all this for the Queen: it doesn’t matter that you forget the name of the winner literally as their championship tickertape falls around them. If Simon Cowell still wants to do this then fine, fine, I still want to watch it.",Arts/Television & radio,Britain’s Got Talent: will Simon Cowell ever stop? Not until the sun engulfs the earth,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/16/britains-got-talent-will-simon-cowell-ever-stop-not-until-the-sun-engulfs-the-earth
4/16/2022,"It’s been a chaotic few days for Elon Musk. After announcing he had quietly become Twitter’s largest shareholder, this week Musk launched a hostile takeover bid, offering to buy the social network for $43bn. Twitter’s board responded on Friday by announcing it would implement a plan that could stall or prevent Musk’s attempt. But experts say the next developments are difficult to predict, said Alma Angotti, an SEC compliance expert at Guidehouse Consulting in Washington. Among many possible paths forward, Musk could retract the offer, dump his existing stock in Twitter, or continue with his quest to take over the company. “Before they go through a lot of time, trouble, and expenses to respond to Musk, Twitter is likely trying to decide how serious he is,” she said. “If they simply say no to his offer, what is he going to do?” So what next? Here are some of the biggest remaining questions about Musk’s surprise acquisition attempt. On 4 April, Musk revealed in a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) he had bought up almost $3bn in Twitter shares, making him the platform’s largest shareholder with at 9.2% stake. (Shortly after, Vanguard group surpassed him, now owning 10.3% of the company.) Musk then offered to purchase Twitter outright at a price of $54.20 a share – 38% higher than Twitter’s 1 April close, the last trading day before his stake in the company was made public – stating this was his “final offer”. While Twitter seems poised to reject the deal, Musk could still buy up additional shares of the company on the open market, or win over shareholder support in the case of a vote. Jack Dorsey, Twitter founder and former CEO, noted in a tweet on Friday that such surprise purchases have always been a risk for the company. “As a public company, Twitter has always been ‘for sale’,” he said. “That’s the real issue.” To prevent such a buyout, Twitter has implemented a relatively rare method called a “poison pill” plan. In this limited-duration shareholder rights arrangement, existing shareholders can buy stocks at a substantial discount in order to dilute the holdings of new investors and protect its ownership. Under the “poison pill” plan, Musk would have to spend an increasing amount of money to maintain a majority stake in the company. In theory, the hostile investor’s cash would eventually run out, but this may be more complicated in practice when contending with the richest man in the world. Musk is worth around $260bn. Twitter’s “poison pill” plan will only go into effect if Musk (or any other would-be purchaser) acquires more than 15% stake in the company. Because that burden is so high, such plans have been triggered only a handful of times in history, said Alon Kapen, a corporate lawyer with expertise in SEC compliance. “No rational buyer would knowingly exceed that threshold,” he said. But Musk already has indicated he may be willing to exceed that threshold, denying Twitter’s offer for an executive a seat on its board of directors - which came with the condition his ownership stake of Twitter would remain below 14.9%. Musk is known for his wacky antics, irreverent public statements, and unexpected business decisions - so you would be forgiven for questioning whether his threats to purchase Twitter are legitimate. It would not be the first time Musk has been caught bluffing. He famously tweeted in 2018 he would take Tesla private and declared he had secured the funding to do so, which the SEC disputes. That move cost him $20m in a settlement with the SEC, which made him promise to screen tweets regarding Tesla in advance (a measure he has been accused of violating multiple times since then). In the 2018 incident, Musk priced Tesla shares at $420 a share – a joking reference to marijuana. His offer to purchase Twitter this week was priced at a similarly cheeky $54.20 a share. Such offers lead many to wonder whether this is all a joke to Musk, said Karen Kornbluh, a senior fellow and tech policy expert at the German Marshall Fund – or if it is strategic. “He has this huge platform, and he maintains it by doing unexpected and crazy-seeming things,” she said. “Often he seems to benefit from the chaos.” Musk also has a storied personal history with Twitter: he faced a defamation lawsuit after using the platform to baselessly call a diver, who rescued a team of young soccer players stuck in a flooded cave in Thailand, a “pedo guy”. The SEC investigated him for his 2018 tweets regarding taking Tesla private and is again investigating him on recent allegations of insider trading related to his tweets. While these experiences appear to have sparked a personal vendetta against Twitter, Musk’s issues are not necessarily universal. “Superficially he seems to argue everyone should be able to say what they want on Twitter, which is an attractive argument to some,” Kornbluh said. “But this is a special case – it’s about following SEC regulations, not free speech.” Civil rights experts have sounded the alarm over a Musk-controlled, “free speech”-focused Twitter. A self-proclaimed “free speech absolutist”, the billionaire has called for a rollback of the platform’s content moderation policies and practices, a prospect that the nonprofit group Muslim Advocates called “extra troubling”. “Online hate speech is a serious threat to the nation’s marginalized communities and frequently translates into offline attacks,” said Sumayyah Waheed, senior policy counsel at Muslim Advocates. In terms of Twitter’s structure, Musk has been clear he would take Twitter private, but tweeted that he “will endeavor to keep as many shareholders in privatized Twitter as allowed by law”. More broadly, some civil rights advocates say the Musk episode shows how tech companies, and those who control them, have far too much power over millions of users. “Users of social-media platforms shouldn’t have to be subject to the whims of bombastic billionaires who are detached from reality and lack any true commitment to free expression, racial justice and democracy,” said Jessica J González, the co-chief executive of the non-profit social justice organization Free Press. Musk’s attempts to buy Twitter come as he is already under the microscope over dealings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In February, Musk accused the SEC of harassing him and his company with “endless” investigations in retaliation for his vocal opinions of regulators. “The SEC seems to be targeting Mr Musk and Tesla for unrelenting investigation largely because Mr Musk remains an outspoken critic of the government,” Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Musk wrote in a letter last month. Angotti said Musk’s Twitter hijinks could cause him additional SEC headaches. He failed to disclose his stake in Twitter in the required timeframe, meaning he is almost sure to face a fine. Furthermore, the SEC will probably investigate whether he indeed had the funds to outright purchase Twitter when he offered to do so this week. “There is going to be a lot of dissection of what he said when and whether he meant it,” she said.",News/Technology,The chaotic week Musk tried to buy Twitter – and the questions that lie ahead  ,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/15/chaotic-week-musk-buy-twitter-questions-ahead
