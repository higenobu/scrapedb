4/27/2022,"Lloyds Banking Group has raised concerns over the “uncertain” outlook for the UK economy amid soaring inflation, warning that the cost of living crisis could result in higher defaults on its loans. It came as the bank reported a 14% drop in first quarter pre-tax profit to £1.6bn from £1.9bn a year earlier, although that was better than the £1.4bn that analysts had expected. The dip was the result of a £177m charge meant to protect the bank from potential defaults linked to the inflation squeezing UK household finances, which hit 7% last month and is making it harder for borrowers to keep up with payments. It marks a reversal from 2021, when Lloyds released £360m of the cash originally put aside for defaults linked to the Covid crisis, thanks to government support programmes that made it less likely that customers would fall behind on their debts. Lloyds, the country’s largest mortgage lender and considered a bellwether for the UK economy, said that while it did not have direct exposure to Russia, the war in Ukraine was affecting customers through higher energy and commodity prices, as well as supply chain disruption. Its chief executive, Charlie Nunn, said the bank was reaching out to customers who may be struggling as a result of the cost of living crisis. “Whilst we are seeing continued recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, the outlook for the UK economy remains uncertain, particularly with regards to the persistency and impact of higher inflation,” he said. “We are proactively contacting customers where we feel they may need assistance and will continue to help with financial health checks and other means of support. We encourage customers, where affected, to get advice early and talk to us,” Nunn added. The lender said it would continue to monitor for any further risks that could emerge from the war in Ukraine. “Investigations so far have not revealed any significant risks, although the group remains vigilant.”",News/Business,Lloyds warns of higher loan defaults amid cost of living crisis ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/27/lloyds-warns-loan-defaults-cost-living-crisis-uk-economy-uncertain
4/27/2022,"Queensland is prepared to step in and take the NRL grand final from traditional hosts, Sydney, amid uncertainty over future hosting rights, while one of the sport’s icons has suggested the Melbourne Cricket Ground should also be considered. Annastacia Palaszczuk’s government on Wednesday would not be drawn on reports it had made a bid to steal the grand final away from Sydney but said it was “happy to talk to the NRL about any proposal”. “Queensland is a global hub for major events,” a spokesperson for the sport minister said. “We’re in regular contact with the NRL to secure more football content for Queensland.” In 2018 the New South Wales government secured hosting rights for Accor stadium in Homebush until 2042, in a long-term deal with the NRL that was dependent on major redevelopment works being undertaken at the old Olympic Stadium. At the time, then NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian said there was a real possibility Sydney could lose the grand final to Brisbane had her government not committed to upgrading its stadiums. But in 2020, the state government’s backflip on its promise to convert the ground into a more football-friendly rectangular stadium had reportedly left the deal dead in the water, and opened up the possibility of the game being taken elsewhere. A report in the Sydney Morning Herald on Wednesday claimed 12 months of negotiations between the NSW government and the NRL over the terms of the original deal were coming to a head. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, who will reportedly meet with Australian Rugby League Commission chair, Peter V’landys, later this week, said the “NRL grand final will be played in Sydney”. “No one wants the grand final in Queensland, including Peter [V’landys],” Perrottet said. “As Peter knows all too well, we have invested record amounts in stadiums and sporting infrastructure. “He also knows that having the grand final in Queensland is a bad outcome for the NRL, for every club and most importantly the fans. So he’s not taking it anywhere.” For its part, the NRL, which has been contacted for comment, has every reason to try to stimulate some healthy competition between potential venues. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The potential for a bidding war could even see other states enter the fray. Wally Lewis, a former Queensland player, said he would back any bid from his home state but added that Victoria could not be discounted either. “Certainly everybody north of the border here thinks it’s an outstanding idea,” Lewis told Channel Nine’s Today program. “I really do believe it’s going to be judged by the finances available and if I’m saying the NRL is chasing the biggest bidder, then it could possibly go to Victoria,” he said. “The MCG hosts 100,000 fans, it’s going to be very difficult to knock them back. “If you’ve got a national rugby league competition, it is extremely important for the NRL to share it around the country. “Sure, you’re going to play the majority of grand finals in NSW, the home of it, but it is extremely important to play the games here at Suncorp Stadium, and also Melbourne.” Sydney, the game’s heartland where the majority of NRL clubs are based, had hosted every grand final since 1908 before Brisbane had its moment in the spotlight last year, when the game was shifted to Suncorp Stadium due to the Covid-19 lockdown in NSW. Queensland’s capital also hosted the one-off Super League grand final in 1997, but otherwise Sydney has managed to maintain a tight hold on the game for over a century.",Sport/Sport,NSW premier dismisses Queensland’s bid for NRL grand final,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/27/nsw-premier-dismisses-queenslands-bid-for-nrl-grand-final
4/27/2022,"Investors have wiped $126bn (£100bn) off Tesla’s value amid concern that Elon Musk may have to sell shares in the electric carmaker to fund his personal contribution to his $44bn acquisition of Twitter. Tesla stock has been targeted despite the company not being involved in the bid but Musk, its chief executive and largest shareholder, is part-funding the Twitter deal with $21bn of his own equity and a further $12.5bn loan secured against his Tesla stake. The 12.2% drop in Tesla’s shares on Tuesday equated to a $21bn drop in the value of his Tesla stake, equal to the cash stake he committed to the Twitter deal. Dan Ives, an analyst at the financial firm Wedbush Securities, said worries about upcoming stock sales by Musk and the possibility he is becoming distracted by the Twitter venture are weighing on the electric carmaker’s shares. “This [is] causing a bear festival on the name,” he said. Ed Moya, an analyst at the online trading platform Oanda, said: “If Tesla’s share price continues to remain in freefall that will jeopardise his financing.” The share fall also took place against a backdrop of difficult trading for tech stocks. The Nasdaq closed at its lowest level since December 2020 on Tuesday, as investors worried about slowing global growth and more aggressive rate increases from the US Federal Reserve. Twitter’s shares also slid on Tuesday, falling 3.9% to close at $49.68, even though Musk agreed to buy it on Monday for $54.20 a share in cash. The widening spread reflects investor concern that the precipitous decline in Tesla’s shares, from which Musk derives the majority of his $239bn fortune, could lead the world’s richest person to have second thoughts about the Twitter deal. As part of the Tesla deal, Musk also took out a $12.5bn margin loan tied to his Tesla stock. He had already borrowed against about half of his Tesla shares. The University of Maryland professor David Kirsch, whose research focuses on innovation and entrepreneurship, said investors started to worry about a “cascade of margin calls” on Musk’s loans.",News/Technology,Concern over Elon Musk’s Twitter takeover wipes $126bn off Tesla value,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/27/concern-over-elon-musk-twitter-takeover-wipes-126bn-off-tesla-value
4/27/2022,"Sarah Palin announced her candidacy for Alaska’s only congressional seat this month, entering a race with dozens of candidates. She certainly brings name recognition to the contest – but another contender may have her beat in that department. His name is Santa Claus. He lives, of course, in North Pole – a town of about 2,000 in Alaska. He has a big white beard and a kindly manner, and Santa Claus is indeed his legal name, though, as a Bernie Sanders supporter, he does not exploit elf labor. He won a city council seat in 2015, to the delight of observers around the world. Now he’s ready to take his political career to the next stage. He’s running to complete the term of the long-serving Republican congressman Don Young, who died last month at age 88. A special primary will be held on 11 June. As for Claus’s politics: he’s been called “a bastion of blue on a city council as red as Rudolph’s nose”. He says voters who look at Sanders’ policy platform can get a pretty good idea of his own, including support for Medicare for All, racial justice, corporate accountability, and free and fair elections. That includes ranked-choice voting, which will feature in the second round of the coming election. “That’s what’s given me the opportunity here,” he said. Ranked-choice voting “gives people with name recognition such as yours truly, and even Sarah, for that matter, a slight advantage”. But Claus hasn’t always had that name. “Seventy-four years ago, I didn’t pop out with a beard,” he says. In fact, Claus changed his name from Tom O’Connor in 2005. He was living in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, at the time, and pondering what he should do with his life, as Julia O’Malley wrote in a 2015 Guardian profile. He had previously worked in law enforcement, where he’d witnessed kids falling “through the cracks” of the foster care system, and he wanted to do what he could to help them, he told the Anchorage Daily News in 2020. He’d already grown the beard, and as he prayed for guidance, someone in a car nearby shouted, “Santa, I love you!” “That’s about as fast an answer to your prayer as I’d probably ever get,” Claus tells the Guardian. “So next day, I called up the county clerk to change my name legally.” It caused a few headaches, including some brief suspicion at airport security, where he got “the once-over”. “Somebody about a month later sent out an email, I guess, letting people know, yeah, there’s this guy Santa who’s gonna be flying around. Not necessarily in my sleigh, but using regular transportation.” Despite his name, greeting children at Christmastime isn’t his thing. “I’m not really interested in that,” he says. “There are plenty of my beloved helpers throughout the world who sort of stand in for me with their in-person visits.” Instead, he says, “I tend to interact more with adults with respect to legislation.” To that end, shortly after changing his name, he embarked on a tour of every state, meeting with governors, their staffers and legislators to advocate for child welfare, as he told the Daily News. It was on this tour that he met his future rival for the congressional seat – and despite the political gulf between them, she made a good impression. “Sarah Palin was one of the governors I visited,” he says. “We met very briefly, but she had set up a meeting with six of her different department heads, which was quite unusual for a governor to do. So I was appreciative,” he says, saying Palin was “very nice, very helpful to me”. As for their disagreements, Claus, who has not declared a party affiliation, is diplomatic. “Now that she’s been endorsed by Trump,” he says, chuckling, “let me put it this way: being a Bernie supporter, we have disparate views on a variety of subjects.” He continues: “I don’t plan to get pushed around by her or by Trump. So it may have some interesting moments during the race,” for which he says he is not soliciting or accepting donations. “As a candidate, as a legislator, I tend to look for common ground. There are people I disagree with and people who disagree with me. But there’s always common ground and one’s willing to make the effort to find it and then legislate for greater good.” The congressional election will determine who completes Don Young’s term, ending in January. If Santa Claus wins, he doesn’t plan to run for re-election. “I think there should be people a decade two or three younger than I am stepping up and doing their best to help their communities and their states. For some positive change, I’d like to do my little part. “Plus I think it’d be kind of fun. Alaska is known for kind of having characters up here. I would certainly be well within that tradition.”",News/US news,Sarah Palin faces formidable opponent in Congress run: Santa Claus,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/27/sarah-palin-faces-formidable-opponent-in-congress-run-santa-claus
4/27/2022,"Somalis call the dangerous journey towards Europe “going on tahriib” a word mostly associated with illegal activities such as trafficking or smuggling. Those who attempt it travel by road through Ethiopia, Sudan and Libya, then by boat across the Mediterranean to Europe – if they’re lucky enough to make it that far. Their families often pay thousands of pounds to unscrupulous smugglers, who may break their initial promises, upping the prices or abandoning victims too early. Yet people still try. And increasingly, climate change is one of the reasons. Sitting under 40C sun in south-west Somalia, Abdirahman Nur Hassan, a local elder and member of the town of Dollow’s drought committee, told me illegal journeys to Europe used to be rare in this region, and were related to youth unemployment, “but now it is becoming common”. Drought is destroying people’s livelihoods and causing them to look for other options, he said. “If this drought continues, things will get worse, the remaining animals will die, and the majority of people living in this area will end up displaced.” The situation in Somalia is catastrophic. Six million people are experiencing crisis levels of food insecurity following three failed rainy seasons, and 81,000 are believed to be in famine. The United Nations has warned that hundreds of thousands of children could die if adequate assistance fails to materialise. 1.4 million children are expected to face acute malnutrition this year. According to the Norwegian Refugee Council, 745,000 people have been displaced by the latest drought, the majority of them since January. Accurate figures on deaths are hard to gather, given that the Islamic militant group al-Shabaab controls large swaths of territory, making it dangerous for government officials or aid agencies to enter them. The climate crisis has played a significant role, making droughts more intense and rain less predictable. The Earth’s temperature has already risen by 1.1C, and Somalia – listed as one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to climate change – is a place where you can see the immediate impacts. In 2011, a famine there killed 250,000 people. Droughts are recurring, meaning victims don’t have a chance to recover in time to face the next one. By the end of this century, the temperature across Somalia is expected to rise by 3C. The climate crisis is largely the result of western emissions, but that has rarely resulted in increased help for developing countries grappling with its effects. The UK has a population just over four times the size of Somalia’s, but produced 520 times its emissions in 2018 – the last year that World Bank figures are available – down from 933 times Somalia’s emissions in 2006. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an average of more than 20 million people a year have been displaced by extreme weather events since 2008. Most stay within their own countries, and in Somalia I’ve seen them: tens of thousands of people in a makeshift camp, with no toilets, no water, children crying from hunger, now fearful of the rain, which will turn the area into an open sewer that spreads disease. Speaking to me on the phone this week, Dr Sukri Hussein Abdi, who works in a Somali stabilisation ward for malnourished children, where they have treated more than 400 children over the past few months, said the effects of the drought are “indescribable”. “People are dying from starvation, we need humanitarian assistance, food, shelter, water to help these people, to save lives, especially.” Last year, the UK cut its foreign aid budget by billions of pounds. In Somalia, a humanitarian response plan put together by the UN has been drastically underfunded. But allowing migration can be a more efficient form of foreign aid. Allowing people in developing countries to more easily travel by safe and legal routes to richer countries gives them a stable place to go, and means they can also get a job and send money back home. In 2020, the World Bank said Somalia received more than $1.7bn in remittances, equating to nearly 25% of its GDP. In a shop in Dollow, I met businessman Abdiweli Dirie Osman. Every five days he collects up to $300 from Somalis who have made it abroad, and uses it to buy bags of rice, sorghum, cooking oil and other essentials, which he distributes to families in need. “The diaspora collect what they can,” he said. This kind of charity is being repeated across the country. Osman’s sister has been in Germany for the past 10 years. “Every family has someone [in Europe],” he said. “Life is very difficult here, there are the cycles of drought. They want a change from the standard of living.” Osman had no idea how many people from this region have left for Europe. “They’ve been going for so long, it’s impossible to count them. It happens all the time,” he said. During the drought, he too hears that the numbers are increasing. When I asked him if he knew about the dangers involved, he laughed. “People are good at taking risks. That is the route. We’re hoping one day that there will be safer routes they can take. It helps society; in times of drought they can help the society.” With every degree that the temperature across Earth rises, experts say, roughly one billion people will either be displaced or forced to live in insufferable heat. We urgently need to ask how to improve the situation, for both those who leave and those who stay.

4/27/2022,"“Bayern Munich have just won their 10th successive Bundesliga,” writes Maggie Phillips. “Is this a European or even a world record?” Bayern’s 3-1 win over Borussia Dortmund on Saturday sealed their 10th consecutive German title. It was the first time that a team in one of Europe’s big leagues has won 10 in a row – the closest before that was Juventus, who won nine on the bounce before walking into Antonio Conte last season. We think the world record belongs to Talea FC of the Oceanic island Vanuatu, who won the Port Vila Premier League for 15 consecutive seasons from 1994 to 2008-09. Amicale FC rose to the not inconsiderable challenge and won the title in each of the next six seasons, though Tafea FC eventually clambered back atop their perch in 2018-19. The European record is shared by Skonto FC of Latvia and Lincoln Red Imps of Gibraltar. Both won 14 titles in a row, Skonto FC between 1991 and 2004 and Lincoln Red Imps from 2003 to 2016. What happened next? Skonto’s coach Aleksandrs Starkovs, who was in charge for the last 12 of those 14 titles, left for Spartak Moscow and took Skonto’s aura with him. FK Ventspils won the league in each of the next three seasons, and though Skonto were champions again in 2010, the club went bankrupt and was dissolved in 2016. Lincoln Red Imps, meanwhile, finished a point behind Europa FC in a relentless 2016-17 title race. They dropped only nine points all season, and scored 100 goals in 27 games, but it wasn’t enough. They’ve won the title in four of the five subsequent seasons, though. Al-Faysali (Jordan, 1959-66, 1970-74*), Rosenborg (Norway, 1992-2004) and Bate Borisov (Belarus, 2006-18) all won 13 in a row, and the nouveau riche Bulgarian side Ludogorets have just claimed their 11th on the spin. You can see the rest of the list at RSSSF. Since you asked, the record for consecutive titles in England is a modest three. Huddersfield Town (1923-26) were the first to achieve that feat, followed by Arsenal (1932-35), Liverpool (1981-84) and Manchester United (1998-2001 and 2006-09). * There was no competition from 1967-69, presumably because of the impact of the Six-Day War. Bec just asked what happens if 2 different players score a hat-trick in a match, who gets the ball?And has it ever happened? One for @TheKnowledge_GU I think 🤔🧐 This has happened multiple times, too often to cite every instance here, but the question about the match ball is interesting. The consensus among our readership is that it is traditionally given to either the first person to score three goals or the one whose hat-trick made everyone feel the warmest and fuzziest. In reality, there are usually enough balls to go round. “There is a recent example of this from everyone’s favourite club, PSG,” writes Daniel Herlihy. “A few weeks ago they beat Clermont Foot 6-1, with Kylian Mbappé and Neymar splitting the goals. Shortly after full-time, PSG posted a video on their social media accounts of both players coming down the tunnel with a match ball in their hands.” Le ballon, le ballon 😏⚽️@KMbappe x @neymarjr 💫#CF63PSG pic.twitter.com/PG5ukPr6xx “In 1983-84, Southampton beat Coventry 8-2 at the Dell, with hat-tricks from Steve Moran and Danny Wallace,” writes Chris Fowler. “I’m not certain who got the match ball. It may have been Wallace, as it was, I think, his first hat-trick, while Moran already had at least one.” That is indeed what happened, though only after a polite dressing-room intervention. “There have been two Football League matches where not only two but three different players have scored hat-tricks,” adds Mike Price. “In March 1962, Wrexham beat Hartlepool United 10-1 in the old Fourth Division. Future Newcastle star Wyn Davies, Ron Barnes and Roy Ambler each scored three. In November 1987, in the old Division Two, Manchester City beat Huddersfield Town by the same score. Tony Adcock, Paul Stewart and David White were the treble scorers.” There’s a good yarn here about what happened to the match ball(s) in the Manchester City game. From Maine Road in the 1980s to Deepdale in the 1990s. “I was there when this happened in Division Three in 1995-96,” says Michael France. “Preston beat Mansfield 6-0 with hat-tricks from Andy Saville and Steve Wilkinson (recently signed from Mansfield). Wilkinson claims he received the actual match ball because he scored his hat-trick first and the chairman found a second one for Saville. This article from the Lancashire Evening Post has more details.” There are some interesting stories of players on both sides scoring a hat-trick. “In September 1982, Reading lost 7-5 at Doncaster Rovers,” writes Jon Keen. “Reading striker Kerry Dixon got four, but Ian Snodin – who scored just three goals for Doncaster – kept the match ball. Whether it was the home team’s choice who got it, or whether it was because Snodin got his hat-trick first, isn’t recorded. But the sense of injustice remains with me the best part of 40 years later.” “Have two teams in the top flight ever played the first of their home and away matches against each other as late as May? Villa and Burnley are yet to play each other in the Premier League this season and are scheduled to play on 7 May and 19 May,” notes David Tanner. We feared this question would go unanswered, so hats off to Martin Jackson, Aaron Grierson and Steve Williams for remembering an unusual fixture pile-up 34 years ago. “In 1988, Luton v Nottingham Forest was played on Friday 13 May and Forest v Luton was played on Sunday 15 May,” writes Martin. “Both matches ended 1-1. The FA Cup final (Wimbledon 1-0 Liverpool) was played on the Saturday.” Steve points out that all the other teams in the division had finished their league campaign before the first meeting between Luton and Forest. Look at this peculiar league table. That’s because, unlike Villa v Burnley this season, both fixtures were rearranged. The match at the City Ground, originally scheduled for 28 November, was postponed because of fog. The return game at Kenilworth Road, which should have been played on 23 April, was put back because Luton were playing Arsenal in a classic Littlewoods Cup final the following day. Luton also reached the Full Members’ Cup final and the FA Cup semi-final, so they had to cram their last seven league games into a 16-day period. In fact, they were one game away from being an answer to last week’s lead question. “Has a goalkeeper ever been sent off during a penalty shootout?” wondered Olumide Hassan in 2007. Hats off to Tommy Tucker, who discovered that Botswana goalkeeper and captain Modiri Marumo was sent off during a Castle Cup shootout against Malawi in May 2003. Having been booked for time-wasting before Malawi scored their third spot-kick, Marumo “reacted to a pat on the shoulder from opposite number Philip Nyasulu by punching him in the face and got a red card”. Malawi went on to win 4-1 and reach the semi-finals. “I overreacted in an exchange of words between myself and my counterpart,” admitted Marumo. It’s also happened since our original story, too. @TheKnowledge_GU who first used the phrase “business end of the season”? And how can we undo that phrase and consign it to Room 101? “In the Chelsea v Arsenal game last week, there was mention of Arsenal fielding the most English players in their XI since 2001. That made me wonder: when was the last time a top-flight match started with 22 English players on the field?” asks Lino Di Lorenzo. After a manager is sacked, clubs usually have compassionate words in their statements. However, are there examples of much more acid statements when things went wrong between both parties? “Newcastle obtained 44 Premier League points in 2017-18, 45, 44 and 45 again last season. So far in 2021-22 they have 43 points from 34 games, but as three of their last four games are against teams in the top four, they could yet end up with 44 or 45 points. Has a club ever shown greater consistency?” asks Steve Gillard. How 'bout this for @TheKnowledge_GU feature?For those of you who don't know Zvonarek signed for Bayern Munich last summer, but was kept at Slaven on loan for the remainder of this season.

4/27/2022,"A Western Australian coroner has criticised police offices for their “woefully inadequate” monitoring of an Aboriginal woman’s breathing after she was pinned to the ground and lost consciousness before being allowed to sit up. Cherdeena Wynne, a 26-year-old Noongar Yamatji woman, died in hospital five days after she was pinned in a prone position by police officers, one of whom had his knee on her shoulder blades and leg across her upper back for almost two minutes. Her father died in custody 20 years before – also at the age of 26. The coroner ruled her death accidental, finding she experienced a cardiac arrest which was contributed to by methylamphetamine intoxication, her physical exertions before her apprehension and her restraint in a prone position. Wynne was restrained by police on 4 April 2019 after she had fled from an ambulance in severe mental distress and had been walking on Albany Highway, a busy arterial road in Perth, in peak-hour traffic, allegedly trying to walk in front of cars. She was led off the road by police and placed into a prone position, lying on her stomach with her hands behind her back, on a grassy verge beside the highway. At an inquest into her death, three police officers involved in the restraint said that they placed her in that position because she was resisting and they were worried she would run back onto the highway. One officer, First Class Const Shaun O’Callaghan, placed one of his legs across Wynne’s hamstrings. Another, Sgt Jace Williams, put a leg over her upper back and kept it there while Wynne was placed in handcuffs. A cannula Wynne had removed from her hand after fleeing the ambulance – and which police thought was a syringe – was thrown clear. The coroner investigating her death, Philip Urquhart, did not make any findings of fault or blame against individual police officers. He said while the decision to handcuff Wynne in the prone position could be justified at the “very upper threshold of what I regard to be a reasonable response”, the time taken by police to remove their weight and sit her up was not justified. In his 100-page findings, released on Wednesday, Urquhart said it was “unnecessary and not appropriate for Officer Williams to continue to restrain Ms Wynne with his leg across her upper back after the cannula was removed from her hand”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Urquhart agreed to a request by Wynne’s family to release CCTV footage of her restraint – which shows Williams kept his leg on her back for almost a minute after she was handcuffed and the cannula was removed. That process, of handcuffing and removing the cannula, took 45 seconds. The footage shows she was held in a prone position for one minute and 50 seconds. “It is impossible to say whether the unjustified delay of about one minute to lift Ms Wynne from the prone position contributed to her cardiac arrest,” Urquhart said. “That is because it cannot be established, with any degree of certainty, precisely when she stopped breathing.” He said the monitoring of Wynne’s breathing while she was in the prone position “was not only woefully inadequate but I am satisfied there was no monitoring during this critical period that was effective in ensuring Ms Wynne had no breathing difficulties”. He dismissed suggestions by police that Wynne was trying to resist apprehension as inconsistent with the CCTV footage. “Any movement that Ms Wynne may have achieved before she became unconscious was most likely due to her inability to breathe, rather than an attempt to resist or escape,” the coroner said.

He said that the inconsistency between the statements given by police, which suggested Wynne was sat up as soon as the cannula was removed, and the delay as shown on CCTV, was “very troubling”. Police said they did not notice Wynne had stopped breathing until they sat her up and noticed she had lost consciousness and her eyes had gone glassy. Paramedics, who were nearby to return Wynne to the ambulance, noted she had no pulse and performed CPR for 12 to 14 minutes to return a pulse before taking her to Royal Perth hospital. She died, without regaining consciousness, on 9 April 2019. An autopsy listed her cause of death as hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and bronchopneumonia in a woman with methylamphetamine effect and exertion with restraint. The pathologists told the inquest it was “very difficult to definitively either include or exclude positional asphyxia as having played a role in the death” because there were other factors, notably methylamphetamine use and significant physical exertion, which also contributed. “When multiple factors have contributed to a death, it is essentially not possible to tease out the exact contribution of each of those factors, other than to say that they have all contributed,” the pathology report concluded. Urquhart said it was “distinctly possible” that positional asphyxia was a contributing factor in her death. His formal finding was death by accident. He said if there had been proper monitoring of Wynne’s breathing “then her cardiac arrest may well have been detected earlier”. But he said it was not open to him to find that would have made a material difference in the outcome. The coroner recommended WA police training on the use of the prone position as a form of restraint should reinforce the need for officers to effectively monitor breathing.
