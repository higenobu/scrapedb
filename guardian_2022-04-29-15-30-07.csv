4/29/2022,"If it hadn’t been for “the slap heard round the world”, this award season would be remembered as the year of the late night band leader. First, The Tonight Show’s Questlove took the best documentary Oscar for his directorial debut, Summer of Soul. A week later The Late Show’s Jon Batiste cleaned up at the Grammys – winning, among others, album of the year for his fifth studio record, We Are. Where’s the love for The Late Late Show’s bandleader, Reggie Watts? “I mean, I haven’t produced anything,” he jokes, “so it’s not all that shocking.” For the past decade the bandleader role has been critical to late-night talkshows, a place where they can project inclusiveness without having to scrap the white, middle-aged male host – “three of them are different versions of the name Jimmy”, Watts rightly notes. But even so, it was a bold move for CBS to pair host James Corden with Watts – the 50-year-old Stuttgart-born, Montana-raised air force brat with the leonine mane. A man who unironically refers to himself as a sonic “disinformationist”, surprising his audiences with sound. Where the other two prominent late-night music makers are at least firmly mainstream – Batiste, a 35-year-old crossover R&B crooner; and Questlove, the hyper-scholarly, 51-year-old drummer for the esteemed rap band the Roots – Watts is out there, man. He’s part synth lord, part improv comic – all performance art. Among other things, he builds tunes on the fly with a synthesizer, a loop pedal, a reverb pedal and prolific beatboxing skills. Non sequiturs and funny accents are go-to building blocks, bemusement the prevailing reaction. Throughout, Watts remains fiercely committed and deadpan in his performances. He’s adorably sui generis – a beautiful weirdo. Like something out of a novel by Alice Walker – who, incidentally, is Watts’s second cousin (although they’ve never met). For decades the late-night bandleader was the ultimate facilitator, the shadow host who helped break up the uncomfortable silences between show segments. Jazz trumpeter Doc Severinsen was the workman NBC Orchestra headliner who gamely played along with Johnny Carson. Paul Shaffer, a most wry and colorful keyboardist, was even more in on David Letterman’s jokes. Jazz guitarist Kevin Eubanks was Jay Leno’s perennial laugh track. And despite their profligate talents and vital responsibilities, none of those legendary bandleaders came close to anything approaching the heft of their hosts because, well, that was the deal. They could either string together gigs in pursuit of a wider fame and fortune, with full understanding that it may never come. Or they could swallow their pride and cover pop hits and TV theme songs in exchange for regular hours, absurdly large pay and swathes of free time to pursue other interests. But besides Max Weinberg, who kept time for Bruce Springsteen’s E Street Band when he wasn’t trafficking in offbeat jokes with Conan O’Brien, bandleaders didn’t really have their breaks and play in and out of them, too. The critical triumphs of Questlove and Batiste would appear to mark a new frontier for late-night band leaders. “When you get two men of color who are really talented and work hard, eventually the industry is like, yes, let’s just give them the award. Because it’s like we need that kind of representation. The work is really great. This is a no-brainer.” But Watts says it’s a shame they had to jump through so many hoops to get there. “The industry is a little bit predictable in many ways,” he says. “If someone like [Questlove or Batiste] has a great idea, there’s a higher likelihood they’ll be recognized. It’s completely not to disrespect their stuff at all, but there’s a lot of gatekeeping. A lot of incredible stuff that is just as good as those things probably exists but they just are not in the mix.” Surely, no one who had been following Watts when he was gigging around Seattle in the late 90s with his prog-rock band, Maktub, or conducting synth pop humor experiments on improv comedy stages would have prefigured him as a spiritual successor to Shaffer, Letterman’s funky longtime sidekick. Watts seemed to be having too much fun making College Humor sketches like the 2007 viral hit What About Blowjobs?, harmonizing about phonics on the PBS Kids program The Electric Company and touring with O’Brien when the on-again off-again Leno successor was barred from appearing on TV in 2010. Just before touring with O’Brien, in 2009, Watts became a regular on a popular improv podcast Comedy Bang! Bang!. When the show was spun into a scripted TV series about a subversive late-night talkshow in 2012, Watts was cast as the one-man bandleader and sidekick to creator-host Scott Aukerman. In addition to providing his usual brand of top-of-the-dome musical accompaniment, Watts jammed with guests and enlivened the show’s delightfully oddball sketches. Really, the TV series was a deconstruction of late-night’s tired formula. Still, Watts never thought it would actually lead to a straight job. (“I was just kinda going along with whatever they had,” he says.) But in 2015, Watts departed for The Late Late Show, ceding his satirical bandleader role to GOAT parodist “Weird Al” Yankovic. Now in his seventh year at The Late Late Show, Watts hasn’t compromised his fringe comedy sensibilities to keep his job at CBS. He still plays with guests, body-swaps with Corden and elevates off-kilter bits. But his lasting impression has been on the show’s band. It not only features an eclectic mix of performers (bassist Hagar Ben Ari, drummer Guillermo E Brown), they’re also masterful improvisers like Watts. “I didn’t want the band and myself as bandleader to just follow in the footsteps of all the other bands – people wearing suits, having a horn section, accompanying the solo artist,” he says. “I wanted it to be a rock band and, not an anti-late night band, but more of a Muppet kind of band.” Watts didn’t want to work hard, either. So he created a band that can make music in the moment. “The band shows up, plays seven seconds or maybe even less than that on some of the bumps to commercial break, and the stuff we do is all improvised,” he says. More than obviating the need for time-consuming rehearsals, the improv format has allowed the band to author a library of 4,000 songs and profit from performing them. “We get equal publishing. It just makes everything super easy and non-competitive.” If anything has changed about Watt’s bandleader act, it’s that he has more latitude to get serious. Corden – who has announced plans to leave The Late Late Show next year – regularly makes space for Watts to lob a question or two at a guest, which helps get them off overselling whatever TV show or movie they’re there to promote. (“We’ve heard that a million times,” he says.) After the murder of George Floyd, Watts and Corden didn’t hesitate to ditch the jokes altogether for bracingly honest conversation, with Watts breaking down while recalling the discrimination he faced growing up in the midwest. “Entertainment shows are great,” he says. “Part of their function is to keep people in a groovier mood and kinda lighten their day. But what is as important is being able to have sincere moments and hear from guests, their perspectives on certain issues. “And not in a way that’s evangelical or classic that’s like, Here’s a star talking about a children’s hospital they support or whatever. I’m talking about just regular, sincere things that [viewers] might not hear about otherwise. Small things that link us all together as human beings. I like to think there’s a coming of an age of sincerity. That’s what I crave. I love when our show has those moments.” You’d think that a daily spot on network television would have provided Watts his pick of opportunities to more meaningful connection through humor. But besides a one-off hire DJing the 2021 Emmys, major studio execs still aren’t sure quite what to make of Watts – who struggles to even get his comedy specials produced. “I had a really cool idea and backing from Bad Robot [JJ Abrams’s production company],” he says. “They were going to meetings with me. We went to everybody and nobody was biting. A lot of projects I do that are me-centric, none of them have been made except for three comedy specials.” That’s not to say Watts is waiting for a handout. He’s made plenty of work on his own. Brasilia, Watts’s short film about a made-up city of the future that sends up a wooden, 70s-era, Arnold Schwarznegger travelogue that’s almost too good to be true – is an absurdly trippy treat. “I think sometimes my ideas are a little bit too … I dunno what it is about it,” says Watts, of his lacking connection with Hollywood C-suiters. “Maybe it’s the Gen X in me. Maybe because I like to remain grounded to the underground and counterculture as much as I can. Having not a lot of success in that way maybe keeps me grounded and closer to that zone, which is very important to my identity. Who knows. Maybe at some point someone’ll be like, ‘OK, let’s give this guy a shot.’”",Arts/Stage,‘The industry is predictable – there’s a lot of gatekeeping’: Reggie Watts is the last weirdo left on TV,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/28/reggie-watts-the-late-late-show-tv
4/29/2022,"TV, USA, 2022 – out 6 May Remember Mike Myers?! The Canadian comedian cemented his place in the collective consciousness with Wayne’s World and reached peak megastar status with the Austin Powers movies. But a light that burns twice as bright burns for half as long, as ol’ mate Eldon Tyrell famously said – thus Myers slipped out of the spotlight. Re-emerging in a very different ecosystem, where box office clout doesn’t necessarily matter, Netflix has commissioned Myers to create, write and star in a spin-off to a movie nobody has talked about a long time: 1993’s So I Married an Axe Murderer. In his six-part series Myers plays not one but eight characters including a far-right radio host, a journalist and a former Russian oligarch. The narrative involves a secret society that controls world events, which sounds very 90s – evoking an era when conspiracy theories still felt like kooky, harmless fun. Film, Australia, 2018 – out 15 May Australian auteur Jennifer Kent’s second feature, after her breathtakingly brilliant The Babadook, follows an Irish convict (Aisling Franciosi) who pursues vengeance against the men who killed her husband and baby circa Tasmania 1825. The beautiful, rugged landscape, shot with painterly flair by Radek Ladczuk, is presented in a boxed-in aspect ratio, which has a psychologically condensing effect, reducing the ability to find solace in the natural world. The violence is so shocking it can barely be spoken let alone written about, though there’s no doubting Kent’s vision, audacity and ability to make piercingly polemic feminist statements. Her next feature film will be the true crime lesbian period piece Alice + Freda Forever. TV, USA, 2022 – out 13 May The 2011 film adaptation of Michael Connelly’s novel The Lincoln Lawyer arrived early in that tectonic plate-shifting period of human history known as the McConaissance. The hunky Matthew McConaughey played an attorney whose office is on wheels, working mostly from the back of a Lincoln Town Car. Mexican actor Manuel Garcia-Rulfo – taking on the role in Netflix’s new series – has big shoes to fill. This take on the character was helmed by hotshot creator David E Kelley, whose recent shows include Nine Perfect Strangers and Big Little Lies. Honourable mentions: The Takedown (film, 6 May), Along for the Ride (film, 6 May), Love Death + Robots: volume 3 (TV, 20 May), Sea of Love (film, 23), Stranger Things: season 4, part 1 (TV, 27 May) Film, 2017, USA – out 20 May A movie about a man walking around with a bedsheet over his head sounds like a dumb joke or a gimmicky student film. And yet writer/director David Lowery’s supernatural drama is an amazing ghost movie; one of the all-time greatest, in fact, full of cosmic energy and a mind-bending outlook. Said apparition (Casey Affleck) returns to the house where he and his partner (Rooney Mara) used to live and observes the space, and the world around him, slowly change while he remains a powerless onlooker, adrift from the space/time continuum. The film barely leaves the one location but shoots to the outer realms of existence and consciousness, tossing around big and even contradictory ideas – about fate and predetermination, for instance, and the universe being a mess of chaos and randomness. Expressing any of these thought bubbles coherently is impressive; pulling it off in the context of a movie about a dude wearing a bedsheet is kind of incredible. Film, Italy, 1960 – out 3 May Following five brothers and their no-nonsense matriarch, Luchino Visconti’s film is long, shaggy and uneven, but manages a rare and near-paradoxical combination – of neo-realism and melodrama. It begins in the key of the former, following the family adapting to life in Milan after relocating from a rural community, and inches towards, then finally explodes with, the latter – tangly romantic plotlines leading to explosively emotional outcomes. Honourable mentions: Zero Dark Thirty (film, 3 May), The Cult of the Family (TV, 4 May), Pet Sematary (film, 7 May), Angelyne (TV, 20 May), Leviathan (film, 14 May), From (TV, 27 May). TV, Australia, 2022 – out 21 May A great Australian horror movie, starring two power-seeking pollies? Or a great Australian comedy, full of cringe-inducing spectacle? Or maybe: another reality TV series, with less attractive people than usual, and one epic round of voting/elimination towards the end? Whatever your thoughts on the federal election, it is unquestionably a huge event on TV and streaming: not as significant as the return of Mike Myers, sure, but a big deal nonetheless. The cast includes everybody’s favourite psephologist – Antony Green. TV, Australia, 2020 – out 9 May If you missed this excellent series from 2020, about four strangers detained in, or working for, an Australian immigration detention centre, it’s returning to iview. Co-created by Tony Ayres, Elise McCredie and Cate Blanchett – who also appears in a small supporting role – the series draws tension and intrigue from a cleverly chopped up, nonlinear narrative that eventually comes together to form a full vivid picture. Production values are impressive across the board, from Bonnie Elliott’s rough-hewn cinematography to Mark Atkin and Martin Connor’s intriguing use of parallel editing. Honourable mentions: Days Like These with Diesel (TV, 4 May), Gruen Nation (TV, 11 May), Black Mirror, season 4 (TV, 13 May), Dirk Gently’s Holistic Detective Agency (TV, 26 April). TV, Italy, 2022 – out 11 May Maybe you care, maybe you don’t care; maybe you like the songs, maybe you can only watch with earplugs in. Either way, you know what Eurovision is about: eclectic musical acts from around the world belting out tunes of varying quality – from those suggesting divine inspiration to others that make listeners say “there is no god”. Love it or hate it, Eurovision has stuck like glitter glue to the zeitgeist since launching in the 1950s. Film, USA, 2006 – out 18 May Created using a process called rotoscoping, which transforms live action into animation, Richard Linklater turned Philip K Dick’s classic dystopian novel into a beautifully odd looking film, with a whacked-out aesthetic befitting its drugged-up characters. Keanu Reeves plays an undercover cop trying to track down the supply chain for a popular and hugely addictive narcotic known as Substance D. To “pose” as a user he must become an addict, which sends him down a dangerous path – towards personal oblivion and a ripsnorting final twist that reveals the true purpose and source of the drug. Linklater returned to the rotoscoping technique recently in the excellent Apollo 10 ½. Honourable mentions: Cobra (TV, 4 May), The Bambers: Murder at the Farm (TV, 10 May), Dark City (film, 11 May), Inside Llewyn Davis (film, 11 May), Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (film, 12 May), Holding (TV, 12 May), The Truth About The Wanninkhof Case (TV, 19 May), Missing Angel (TV, 26 May). TV, USA, 2022 – out 20 May What do you do when your neighbour correctly suspects you’re hiding something in your shed – and that certain something is your portal to a distant deserted planet? Sissy Spacek & JK Simmons confront this entirely relatable, everyday conundrum in a new series that looks, from the trailer, like an elongated, slightly sweetened episode of The Twilight Zone. Playing a married couple, the pair hold hands, exchange sweet nothings, and leave this stinkin’ planet to visit a far prettier one. Film, various years – out 11 May The latest James Bond outing – last year’s No Time to Die – is one of those franchise exercises determined to evoke “grand finale” vibes despite the fact we all know the narrative will soon be rebooted for more milking of the cash cow. Prime Video will upload the entire collection on 11 May. Honourable mentions: The Godfather trilogy (film, 1 May), The Hobbit trilogy (film, 1 May), Sully (film, 4 May), The Wilds, season 2 (TV, 6 May), Conversations with Friends (TV, 16 May). TV, USA, 2022 – out 16 May Audrey Niffenegger’s novel is great; the mawkishly sentimental 2009 movie starring Eric Bana and Rachel McAdams is awful. Therefore the bar set for HBO’s new six-episode adaptation is both very high and, in terms of screen adaptations, very low. Written by veteran Steven Moffat – best-known as head writer and executive producer of Dr Who – the role of Clare Abshire, who has to put up with a partner with an uncontrollable tendency to spontaneously melt away then reappear in another timeline, will be played by Downton Abbey and Game of Thrones’ Rose Leslie, and the titular time traveler by Theo James. Film, USA, 2021 – out 3 May Sion Sono’s dystopian sci-fi movie is far from the greatest Nicolas Cage movie: in fact – as someone who has seen, written about and ranked every single one of them – I can tell you that it is precisely the 74th best. But this ballsy midnight movie about a criminal (Cage) with bombs attached to each of his testicles, on a mission to find a governor’s missing daughter, does have Nicolas Cage in it, which alone makes it worth watching. Cage is currently experiencing one of several career comebacks, and is currently in cinemas going full meta in the enjoyable action-comedy The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent. Honourable mentions: The Suicide Squad (film, 3 May), The Staircase (TV, 5 May), Halloween Kills (film, 12 May), Elysium (film, 13 May), Gravity (film, 28 May). TV, USA, 2022 – out 27 May“Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi, you’re our only hope!” Those famous words were first spoken a lllooonnggggg time ago, in, yes, a galaxy far far away – originating in George Lucas’s brilliantly innovative first Star Wars movie. There have been so many Star Wars productions since that it’s easy to forget the pioneering spirit of the originals, though it would be unreasonable to expect the latest of countless sequels and spin-offs to rekindle that spirit. Ten years ago, the release of an Obi-Wan Kenobi series – with Ewan McGregor returning to a character he played in the (*shudder*) Lucas-directed prequel movies – would have been huge news; now it feels like just another suck on the teat. But hey: I’ll be watching. Film, USA, 1991 – out 18 May Oliver Stone’s very long but engrossing classic arrived at a time when the director was making powerful political statements and Kevin Costner was a huge box office drawcard. The assassination of JFK (and later Lee Harvey Oswald) remains, of course, one of the greatest magnets for American conspiracies, dramatised in Stone’s film with cloak and dagger lines such as (this one’s spoken by Donald Sutherland) “you’re closer than you think.” Famous scenes include Kevin Costner’s “magic bullet” courtroom monologue. Honourable mentions: Sneakerella (film, 13 May), The Revenant (film, 13 May), The Valet (film 20 May), Pistol (TV, 31 May). TV, USA/Japan, 2022 – out 24 May Veteran director Michael Mann (whose best work includes Collateral, Heat, and The Insider) has slowed down in recent times, with seven years transpiring between his last production (Chris Hemsworth thriller Blackhat) and Tokyo Vice, a TV series he executive produced and directed the first episode of. Ansel Elgort plays an American journalist who relocates to Tokyo and takes on a dangerous beat, investigating the yakuza. Expect neon lights, loud music and an operative tone. Honourable mentions: Star Trek Beyond (film, 2 May), Star Trek: Strange New Worlds (TV, 6 May), A Life Too Short (film, 10 May), Finding Yingying (film, 10 May), Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber (TV, 12 May).",Arts/Television & radio,"Eurovision, Mike Myers, and every James Bond movie: what’s new to streaming in Australia this May",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/29/eurovision-mike-myers-and-every-james-bond-movie-whats-new-to-streaming-in-australia-this-may
4/29/2022,"Over the years we’ve been together, my wife and I have become increasingly “visible” as lesbians. There’s the somewhat obvious fact that we’re a couple, which automatically makes us more identifiably gay than we were when we were single. But there’s also been the evolution of our haircuts from straight-passing, to short and choppy, our recent adoption of a cat (it’s a thing, look it up), and the fact that sizeable proportions of our wardrobes consist of dungarees and blazers. Moulding to stereotypes isn’t, of course, the pinnacle of “lesbian visibility”. But I do think that, having grown up believing that “looking gay” was an insult, the fact that both of us now generally view that description as a compliment demonstrates some degree of self-acceptance. And acceptance – whether it be of yourself or of others – is surely what Lesbian Visibility Week (which we’re currently in, by the way) is all about. Lesbian Visibility Day, or week, as it’s now become, has been around since 2008, the entirety of my life as an out lesbian. I’ve always viewed it as a positive thing: an opportunity to be proud of who we are and how far we’ve come, and to keep fighting to be seen equally. But this time around I’ve found it trickier to stomach. I hadn’t even realised it was this week, until I was informed via an email from Stonewall. And the next email in my inbox was from the British Transport Police, asking me to digitally sign the statement I provided after my wife and I were victims of a homophobic hate crime on a recent train journey. The incident took place a few weeks ago. Men on the train were hurling abuse at us, and I didn’t feel as if there was much I could do about it. Rather than turning around and shouting back, I instead avoided eye contact and stayed silent, knowing that we were outnumbered and unable to defend ourselves if they decided to physically attack us. When things escalated and they started throwing things at us, I went and told on them to the train manager like a pathetic schoolchild, rather than standing up for myself as I felt I should have been able to as a fully grown adult. And I can’t help thinking that even if CCTV can identify the men who did this to us, there will probably be other incidents like this in my life, and I will probably feel just as helpless. It’s still undeniable that being visibly a lesbian can put me in danger. And at the moment I feel more scared than in the mood for celebrating. As much as I don’t want to let those men and people like them “win”, I probably will think twice before I get another train home late at night, or before I next hold my wife’s hand in public. While you may be able to switch on the telly and see two men dancing together in the Strictly final, or drag queens advertising us everything from broadband to quarter pounders, it’s still not safe to be visibly gay. LGBT+ hate crimes are on the rise in this country while homophobic laws have been introduced in others, and increasing criticism of gender non-conformity has made anyone who doesn’t quite fit in with traditional gender norms a potential target. This kind of fear is not exclusive to gay women, it’s important to add. Being a woman alone is enough to attract abuse, as is being Black, or trans, or anything else that might make someone appear visibly “different”. I’m usually all for being “visible”. I love the fact that queer teenagers in the UK now have grown up with a whole host of out-and-proud role models on their TV screens and social media feeds – perhaps in their parents’ friendship groups, too. I love the camaraderie of a room full of proud dykes and bi women about to go out clubbing together, where a friend can yell, “Five minutes until we need to leave: start lacing your Doc Martens” and we can all laugh at ourselves. And I loved getting married – married in a church, even – surrounded by friends and family last year. But it frustrates me how those us in these marginalised groups are constantly having to think about how to stay safe in our day-to-day lives, just in case someone is waiting to harass us for simply being ourselves. Soon, hopefully, I’ll be pulling on my Doc Martens and joining those who have enough energy to fight back against all of this, and against all the other terrible things going on in the world right now. But forgive me if this Lesbian Visibility Week I’m too scared and tired to be much of an activist. Just let me get home safely to my cat.

4/29/2022,"The irony of visiting a 17th-century plague chapel in the midst of a 21st-century pandemic wasn’t lost on me when I donned my mask, sanitised my hands and stepped into the cool of a tiny church. It was built in 1628 so the afflicted could come and pray separately from the villagers of Saint-Haon-Le-Châtel, but if it served the same purpose for Covid-suffering villagers now, it was a relief to find it empty. The same went for this area of the Auvergne: Le Roannais was peaceful and empty of tourists. And, as this summer will be the first foreign holiday for many after two years of limitations, it is the perfect place to get away from it all, especially of the lingering threat of Covid make crowds unpalatable. The Auvergne is one of the most sparsely populated areas in Europe, and Le Roannais is a tapestry of gold and green vineyards and villages between the cities of Roanne and Vichy. I knew that Auvergne was a land of volcanoes, dramatic regional parks and very few people, but in 16 years of writing about France, this slice of gentle rolling countryside and high wooded hills almost in the centre of France was a complete revelation. After we’d settled into our Airbnb near the town of Renaison – a house belonging to probably the most welcoming and generous family I have ever met in France – we ventured out to the local reservoir to see its biggest claim to fame: the tallest tree in France. “How do they know it’s the tallest?” quizzed the kids. “No idea,” we admitted, as we wandered along the sun-dappled path under lofty Douglas firs to the famed arbre, a towering 66 metres tall. It was planted as recently as 1892,when the Chartrain dam had been built to create the reservoir. Sure, it wasn’t a 700-year-old, 100-metre California redwood, but to have gained an average of 27cm a year wasn’t bad going; perhaps it just quietly flourished in these heavenly surroundings. After scrambling down the bank to gaze up its trunk, we walked on to cross the top of the dam as martins swirled overhead and the reservoir reflected the surrounding forest like a mirror. A giant tree may win the record-breaker title, but it was the area’s medieval villages that won the beauty contest, with their crooked timber-framed houses, abundant flowers, and churches boasting the colourful tiled roofs you also see in Burgundy. We fell for Le Crozet and Ambierle, as well as Saint-Haon-Le-Châtel, where we strolled the narrow streets, the buildings’ amber hue glowing warm in the late-afternoon sun. We stood out by the ramparts looking across the undulating landscape, stretching towards Burgundy’s Morvan national park, and I felt baffled as to why nobody comes here. Though the beauty of the villages and the landscape had been a surprise, I’d had an inkling we would eat and drink well. France’s gastronomic capital is Lyon to the east, and the Auvergne’s main town, Roanne, is home to the Troisgros culinary dynasty: the family run a three-Michelin star restaurant and two more casual restaurants. They support dozens of local suppliers, including Renaison’s Domaine Sérol vineyard – one of many vineyards in La Côte Roannaise– now run by the eighth generation of the Sérol family. The region’s gamay grapes create easy-drinking wines similar to those from the Beaujolais. We toured the Sérols’ estate, which is high on the hill above Renaison, then lowered our masks to sip their light reds and rosés before snapping up bottles for about €8 a pop. We stocked up for alfresco dinners at Les Halles de Renaison, a tiny but excellent food market with everything from a technicolour array of fruit and veg to succulent meat. For fromages, we picked from Mons Cheesemongers, which has a global reputation and its own outlets in London. Our mouths watered at the stall of chocolatier François Pralus, a local whose boulanger father invented the decadent praluline, a buttery brioche copiously studded with the area’s signature pink-sugar-coated pralines. The much-awarded Père Pralus thought his son would ruin them when he became a chocolatier – but he proved him wrong. He now has shops all over France and his Barre Infernale in various flavours is the most delicious confection I’ve ever tasted. The hills that look over Le Roannais – Les Monts de la Madeleine – were perfect for walking off the calories. On the hottest day, we walked in the shade of oak and beech trees into the Gorges du Désert, following a waterfall that usually gushes with water but was just a trickle in the summer heat. We emerged from the trees on the peak to take in fabulous views as far as the Alps (on a clear day), then descended into the village of Saint-Alban-les-Eaux, famous for its mineral water. Another day, we ventured further into the Livradois-Forez regional park, to walk through purple heather and past donkeys in paddocks. The viewpoint promised sight of Mont Blanc on the horizon, and though it was lost in the haze, the panorama was still breathtaking. While Le Roannais has been tamed by its vineyards and farms, the Livradois-Forez regional park is an altogether wilder prospect, its dense pine forests dotted with meadows and moors and tiny hamlets. Its largest town, Thiers, has a population of just 11,000, halved since the early 20th century, but it is the knife-making capital of France. En route, I stopped for lunch to tuck into a delicacy closely linked to the trade: the cabbage sausage of Arconsat. At the cosy Auberge de Montoncel, Jean-Louis Garret – Grand Master of the Brotherhood of the Cabbage Sausage – explained how, in the 19th century, half the town’s working population peddled knives door-to-door. One of these hawkers made it as far as Greece, took a fancy to the local lamb-and-cabbage sausage and brought the idea back to make his own. In mid-November, the cabbage sausage festival attracts a whopping 1,700 people. Jean-Louis serves it with a sauce made from the park’s signature cheese, fourme d’ambert. It’s rich and filling, with the cabbage inside lending it some bite – ideal sustenance for both the knife-makers and the itinerant sellers of Thiers. In the early 20th century, there were 18 knife workshops in the Vallée des Rouets, their grinding stones powered by watermills over the Durolle River. To give themselves the best control over the fast-spinning stone wheels, the émouleurs – the men shaping rough-hewn pieces of metal into blades – lay on their fronts in rows. In winter their dogs would sit on their legs for warmth. From this position, they could shaped a blade a minute. Though mechanisation led to the end of this technique, Thiers still has a thriving knife trade, as well as a small museum and studios where visitors can watch today’s designers at work. The town was buzzing with more people than I’d seen in a week, milling around the town’s dozen or so shops and buying pocket knives, chefs’ knives, hunting knives, razors and stylish cutlery. After a look in the most renowned shop, Coutellerie Chambriard, where the fourth generation of the family now advise customers on which knife exactly fits their requirements, I wandered through the narrow medieval streets under towering the crisscrossed timber facades. The end of the main street looks out across the valley towards the Chaîne des Puys, the row of extinct volcanoes for which the Auvergne is most famous. Down below, the Vallée des Usines was once a thriving hub of industry, but now the knife factories sit empty, and ripe for development. The most famous, the Creux de l’Enfer (“hell hole”) has already been transformed into a contemporary arts centre. If knife factories are lacking in glamour, I found the opposite in Vichy, an hour away. Famed for its mineral water springs, the city had its heyday during the reign of Napoleon III. Its myriad architectural styles somehow combine to create a work of beauty – from the art nouveau frontage of the former casino, to the extraordinary dome and tower of the art deco church. When I arrived, there were just a few people sitting in the shade of the ornate covered walkways that run between the spa, opera house and former casino. But I couldn’t help wondering if, even in non-Covid times, its four-year stint as the seat of Marshal Pétain’s collaborationist government during the second world war did for its reputation. My guide Alla shakes her head vigorously at the suggestion: “We have 2,000 years of history here. Why would four years ruin that?” She’s right. Vichy offers pure delight with every turn: as she led me to the riverfront, through parks overlooked by elaborate villas and into the spa to test out the fivemineral springs, I was entranced. Even the pavements are inlaid with a mosaic pattern of the city’s signature red, white and blue. But the opera house is the pièce de resistance – with its gold and ivory decor, exquisite ornate ceiling and cupola roof in the adjoining salon. With fewer visitor numbers, we relished the peace and hoped – in an entirely selfish way – that next time we come to Vichy, and indeed Le Roannais, we might just have it all to ourselves again.

4/29/2022,"In a windowless conference room in Canary Wharf, dozens of mining executives, bankers and government officials are being promised unique insights into how to profit from “the deep-sea gold rush”. The hoped-for gold rush lies thousands of miles away on the bed of the Pacific Ocean, where trillions of potato-sized nodules of rare earth elements vital to power the next generation of electric cars have been discovered 4,000m below the surface. Mining companies are hoping that global rules to allow industrial scale deep-sea mining to collect the haul could be set in place as early as July 2023. However, environmental campaigners warned that mining for the metals would be “dangerous”, “reckless” and cause “irreversible harm” to little-known ecosystems. One estimate suggests that 90% of the deep-sea species that researchers encounter are new to science. Louisa Casson, a Greenpeace campaigner, criticised the industry for running the conference and banks for considering investing in the “dangerous and unnecessary” projects to “make a quick profit”. “This destructive new industry wants to rip up an ecosystem we are only just starting to understand,” she said. “[They are] aiming to make a quick profit while our oceans and the billions of people relying on them bear the costs.” The nodules in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone between Hawaii and Mexico were first discovered by the crew of HMS Challenger in 1875, but only recent developments in underwater robotics has made large-scale mining of the metals possible. The UN-affiliated organisation that oversees the controversial new industry has granted licenses for companies to explore the area, but full-scale mining has yet to start. That could soon change, however, as the tiny Pacific island nation of Nauru has triggered a “two-year rule”, giving the International Seabed Authority (ISA) two years to implement regulations governing the industry. That set a deadline for a roadmap to be adopted by 9 July 2023. “Deep-sea gold rush is a gamechanger,” read adverts for the Deep Sea Mining Summit 2022 at the Hilton London hotel in the capital’s Canary Wharf district, for which delegates paid £1,195 for the two-day event this week. “After years of negotiations and false starts, deep-sea mining is close to a breakthrough. “As we move into an era of mining the deep-ocean floor, the world’s most remote environment, mining companies are working on overcoming the perceived challenges and developing island nations are watching with interest. As the demand for base metals and minerals surges ever beyond what our land is able to provide, new technological and technical developments are helping to drive forward this new industry.” Daniel Wilde, economic adviser on oceans for the Commonwealth Secretariat, which represents Nauru and many of the other small island states keen to start seabed mining, told the conference that he expected the ISA to agree a payment regime that would hand mining companies a post-tax profit of 17.5%. However, he warned the audience that “the two-year deadline does seem quite tight, [and] if it’s not agreed there are questions about what happens next”. Ebbe Hartz, a geologist at Aker BP, a Norwegian oil exploration company part-owned by BP, said mining for seabed metals could eventually overtake drilling for oil. “But the problem is going to be finding [the metals], and we don’t have a lot of data.” Hartz said machine-learning data collection would be key to the success of seabed mining, and would ensure “we don’t need to make all the errors we made with hydrocarbons”. Eleanor Martin, a partner at law firm Norton Rose Fulbright who advises banks on financing offshore projects, said global banks were “very eager” to invest in deep-sea mining projects as they project the cost of lithium and cobalt needed for electric car batteries will continue to spiral upwards. “To build the number of [electric] cars we will need, we will need much more of these metals.” “Banks are sitting on pots of green money,” she said in reference to money designated for projects aimed at tackling the climate crisis. “But they need to know that mining projects are green and sustainable.” Katherine Reece Thomas, an associate law professor and director of public international law at City, University of London, warned the industry that it needed to do more to win over public opinion before planning to start mining the oceans. “There is an impossible conflict between those who say we can’t possibly do this, to others who say we need to take this stuff in order to tackle climate change on earth,” she said. Jessica Battle, who runs the WWF’s No Deep Seabed Mining campaign, said: “Deep-seabed mining is highly risky and will cause irreversible harm to the ocean, to its life and its ability to help mitigate climate change. Investing in such a highly unsustainable industry at a time when we need to reduce our footprint on the natural world is irresponsible. “Any short-term incentives offered are far outweighed by the long-term benefits of a healthy ocean and so WWF and others are calling for a global moratorium on deep seabed mining. Alternative solutions already exist – innovation, recycling and repair can satisfy industries’ need for raw materials without opening the seafloor to mining.” Casson, from Greenpeace, said: “There is absolutely no need to mine the deep oceans and cause further harm to our planet. We’ve been pleased to see the biggest players in the electric car and technology sectors, including Microsoft, Google, Volvo, BMW and Samsung, all call out the greenwash of the deep-sea mining companies and commit not to use deep-sea mined minerals in their products. “This nascent industry should stop before it even begins. We need to transition towards a more circular economy, in which we waste less and reuse more, instead of trying to destroy one of our planet’s last great wildernesses at the bottom of our oceans in the name of profit.”",News/Business,‘Deep-sea gold rush’ for rare metals could cause irreversible harm,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/29/deep-sea-gold-rush-rare-metals-environmental-harm
4/29/2022,"Thanks to the two-pronged assault on conventional reality perpetrated by Donald Trump and Covid-19, we’re in a golden era for conspiracy theorists. Ripe for parody, then. But is Mike Myers – who has been noticeably absent from our screens the last decade – the man with the takedown? The premise of this six-episode run is simple (or is that just what they want us to think?) as the titular secret society – which has been controlling world events since 1347 – faces exposure thanks to a Canadian journalist. As is often the case with Myers, the performances (he plays eight characters) outstrip the material but it’s not without its moments, with help from Jennifer Saunders and Lydia West cameos.Netflix, from Tuesday 3 May This complex Israeli thriller returns, and after the chaos at the end of season one it really had no choice. Following the botched attack on the Iranian reactor, Mossad presents sleeper agent Tamar (Niv Sultan) with a fait accompli: if she and Milad (Shervin Alenabi) want to be extracted from Tehran, she’ll have to help rescue the captured Israeli pilot. “This is one of the most important operations in Israel’s history,” she’s told. Can she really trust her handlers? Tehran’s secret is its ability to cross the narrative streams; between the demands of global realpolitik and the individuals adrift in its currents.Apple TV+, from Wednesday 4 May The platform’s first Nigerian original drama is a gripping and slightly melodramatic affair following best friends Sarah and Kemi (Ini Dima-Okojie and Nancy Isime) as Sarah’s wedding day takes a turn for the unexpected. Partly due to family pressure, Sarah is preparing to marry Kola – despite his private propensity for physical and emotional abuse. However, events soon push the two women towards the Thelma & Louise option. It’s a pacy tale of family, friendship and trust, with Lagos a vivid and intensely lively backdrop to the action.Netflix, from Tuesday 3 May Lavishly adapted from the webtoon Annarasumanara, this Korean coming-of-age drama explores a common paradox: many people spend their youth longing to grow up, and their adult years wishing they were young again. There’s a strong element of magic realism in the style and premise – Yoon Ah-yi (Choi Sung-eun) is a lonely teenage girl; bullied, unhappy and dreaming of escape. In an abandoned amusement park, she finds the mysterious Lee Eul (Ji Chang-wook), a magician who dispenses pithy wisdom and consolation in equal measure.Netflix, from Wednesday 4 May As we meet Shiv Sheridan (Roisin Gallagher), she’s gazing longingly at a man – more accurately, a man’s breakfast pint – at Dublin airport. She’s been sober for five months and 17 days but it isn’t easy. Back in Ireland for her grandmother’s wake, she also wants to try to rebuild bridges with her resentful family. But how much of the past can she leave behind? Melancholy and darkly funny by turns, The Dry is from the team behind Normal People. It shares a perceptive eye for emotional nuance – in this case, Shiv’s relationship with the rituals of drinking.BritBox, from Thursday 5 May If you’ve ever wondered about the origin of the phrase “Stockholm syndrome”, this drama will explain everything. Telling the story of the infamous but charismatic Swedish gangster Clark Olofsson, one of Clark’s central events is the Norrmalmstorg robbery of 1973, which resulted in an apparent bond forming between the criminals and their hostages. But it soon becomes clear that there’s a lot more to Olofsson than this; his picaresque story of drugs, sex, crime, childhood trauma and glorious 70s fashionwear is brought to life with rakish glee by Bill Skarsgård.Netflix, from Thursday 5 May A welcome third series for this comedy showcase, which gives exposure to standups just below Live at the Apollo status and also offers a chance to see more established names in a small-ish room. Previous runs have seen sets from the likes of Nish Kumar, Desiree Burch, Catherine Bohart and Sindhu Vee, so there’s a fair chance at least a few big names will emerge.

4/29/2022,"Scores of severely ill Covid-19 sufferers survived because they were given the NHS’s highest form of intensive care in which an artificial lung breathes for them, a study has found. Patients in the UK who underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were more likely to survive than those who did not have the treatment, according to the research. People whose breathing capacity had collapsed were more likely to stay alive if they had ECMO rather than only a spell on a mechanical ventilator. That is the key finding of an analysis of 1,363 people treated for severe Covid using a ventilator in the UK in between March 2020 and February 2021. They included 243 who were taken by ambulance to either Guy’s and St Thomas’ or the Royal Brompton and Harefield hospital trust in London to try to save their lives using ECMO. The other 1,120 were known as what doctors called “perceived futility” cases – those it was deemed inappropriate to put on ECMO because they were considered too old and sick to survive Covid, and ECMO was thought unlikely to change their outcome. Doctors also had to consider who would benefit most from the limited availability of artificial life support, which is costly and labour-intensive, at the two specialist centres. The 243 were matched by computer analysis for their similarity of personal profile and symptoms with 206 of the 1,120 patients who did not receive ECMO to compare their outcomes. The study, which has been published in the journal Intensive Care Medicine, found that 44% of the non-ECMO group died, while mortality was much lower among those who had the treatment at 26%. During ECMO, blood is taken out of the unconscious patient’s body, put into an oxygenator, has oxygen and carbon dioxide added and is then reinserted into the patient. The hope is that the extra oxygen will improve patients breathing enough to help them pull through. “ECMO had a substantial effect at saving lives in the UK. Lives were saved due to the significant effort on the part of NHS staff to ramp up ECMO provision to provide service for as many [patients] as possible,” said Dr Luigi Camporota, a consultant in intensive care medicine at Guy’s and St Thomas’ who was one of the co-authors. “Our findings suggest that ECMO delivery at specialist SRF [severe respiratory failure] centres confers significant survival benefit, compared to matched patients who received conventional therapy in referring centres,” he said. NHS bosses believe ECMO saved several hundred lives during the pandemic. Prof Stephen Powis, NHS England’s national medical director, said: “This study is a testament to the incredible hard work of NHS staff over the last two years who have treated more than 700,000 Covid-19 patients in hospital including on ECMO machines, which have helped save hundreds of lives.” The survival from Covid thanks to ECMO seen in the study is higher than in other studies of its use conducted in other countries. However, the results are not directly comparable because of differences between them such as in the selection criteria for deciding which patients received ECMO and whether people were treated in a general hospital or specialist centre, such as the two hospital trusts in the capital. In this study, 22.9% of the ECMO and 52.9% of the non-ECMO patients died during the first wave of Covid. Mortality rose in both during the second wave, which occurred during winter 2020-21, to 26.1% and 62.4% respectively.",News/Society,External blood oxygenation saved hundreds of Covid-19 sufferers – study,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/29/external-blood-oxygenation-saved-hundreds-of-covid-19-sufferers-study
4/29/2022,"Good morning. I’m Nimo Omer, the assistant editor of First Edition, and I’ll be with you every Friday. It’s been a pretty grim week for women. Most visibly, in politics a national newspaper published a story comparing one of the country’s leading female politicians to Sharon Stone’s character in Basic Instinct. News broke a few days later that an MP is being investigated after allegations he was watching porn in the Commons chamber. 56 other MPs are under investigation for sexual misconduct. But it isn’t only about the most powerful women in the country. This week the Guardian and BBC published allegations from seven women against former BBC DJ Tim Westwood. He has strenuously denied wrongdoing. All of the women are Black, and some felt that racism would lead people to minimise, dismiss or ignore their claims. So why is it so difficult for these women to be heard? I spoke to the Guardian’s community affairs correspondent, Aamna Mohdin, who worked on the Westwood story, to find out. Before that, a bit of housekeeping. It’s a bank holiday on Monday, so there won’t be a newsletter – but take a look lower down for our cultural picks to entertain you this long weekend – and Archie will be back with you on Tuesday. Now, the headlines. 1. Ukraine | Last night, Russia attacked Kyiv with two cruise missiles. Ukrainian rescue officials have said the explosions have injured at least ten people and partially destroyed a 25 storey residential building. Click here for all the latest from Ukraine. 2. Ukraine | In one of the largest deployments since the cold war, the UK is set to send 8,000 troops to eastern Europe to combat Russian aggression. The news came as Joe Biden asked Congress for a massive new $33bn US aid package for the country. 3. Race | A non-verbal black 17-year-old was taken to an immigration centre despite never having left the UK. The teenager was incorrectly recorded as Nigerian and recorded as facing “imminent” removal from the UK before he was found. 4. Politics | A female MP accused a Labour frontbencher of telling her she would succeed because men wanted to sleep with her. The news came as Boris Johnson faced pressure to act over claims a Tory MP watched pornography in parliament. 5. Brexit | British seaports are considering legal action against the government to recover the costs of unused border control posts after confirmation post-Brexit import checks will be delayed for a fourth time. For a better sense of how the intersections of race and gender affect Black women who make complaints of sexual misconduct, I spoke to Dr Ava Kanyeredzi, a senior lecturer in forensic, clinical and community psychology at the University of East London. “Black women’s victimisation is never quite believed as valid, because Black women are experiencing racism, colourism – there’s a lot of forms of abuse and violence that Black women manage in their everyday experiences,” she says. She argues that this gets reproduced in the institutions and services that are meant to help them. Here are some of the key barriers: Lack of trust Before we even get to the problems Black women face in the criminal justice system, we have to start with the big picture: their lack of faith in public institutions in the first place. “There are huge levels of distrust,” Aamna tells me. “They see the violence and trauma that the institutions that are meant to protect them cause in their communities. So the idea that they would go to the police is just laughable to a lot of people.” The police isn’t the only route for women who make complaints of abuse: they might turn to charities, social services, or the NHS. But a lot of the time, these services fail to understand the nuances of Black women’s experiences. “We’ve got a government that doesn’t believe in culturally sensitive services any more,” Aamna says. To some on the right, that’s a punchline. In practice, what it means is finding better ways to help women whose first language isn’t English, or who have precarious legal status, or who have different ideas of what a “normal” family looks like. The Black women Dr Kanyeredzi spoke to for her research “felt betrayed by social work professionals,” she said. “These services become places that do not recognise their victimisation. So why would they seek support from a service that they believe is unsafe and doesn’t represent their interests?” This lack of trust extends to the media too. When Aamna was reporting her story on Tim Westwood, she had many extended conversations with the women making these allegations. It was a slow, challenging process – and before her sources would open up to her and her colleague Alexandra Topping, they had to earn their trust. Generational injustice If the police and the social services often fail the Black women they are meant to help, they are hardly acting in a vacuum, Dr Kanyeredzi says. Generations of bigotry mean that they are less likely to be recognised as possible victims of sexual violence and abuse. “Broadly speaking, there are ‘ideal’ typical victims of sexual violence,” she said. “And the ideal typical victims of sexual violence aren’t Black women.” This can, and has, manifested in the “adultification” of Black girls, Aamna says: “Black girls particularly just get seen as adults from a really young age.” This phenomenon was exemplified recently in a school in Hackney, where a 15-year-old Black girl was strip searched by police, while she was on her period, because her teachers thought they smelt cannabis. Access to services and justice All of this makes it difficult for Black women to access the relevant services that should protect and help them. But even when Black women do approach these services, it doesn’t always turn out well. According to data from Refuge, a domestic violence charity, between March 2020 and June 2021, Black women were 14% less likely to be referred to them for support by police than their white counterparts. This is despite the fact that, in that period, Black women were 3% more likely to report abuse. An investigation by National World also revealed that 37 police forces were more likely to bring charges for rape, sexual assault and domestic abuse cases when the person was white. The wider context There are other reasons Black women may be reluctant to share their experience. “Not only did they think that the institutions would not believe them, they also said that they thought it would backfire quite negatively on them,” Aamna said. They may face sexism within their own communities, too, she added. Convictions for sexual assaults, rapes, and other forms of sexual violence are extremely low generally – according to the charity Rape Crisis only one in 100 rapes reported to police result in a charge. If things are already so bad overall, where does that leave Black women? Football | Eintracht Frankfurt beat West Ham 2-1 last night. “We didn’t show enough quality. Sometimes the opposition make it hard for you,” said West Ham manager David Moyes. Cricket | Ben Stokes said that it was “a real privilege” to captain England after he was appointed to the job on Thursday. Stokes said that his predecessor Joe Root would be a “key ally” in the team. Football | Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp said he is “delighted, humbled, blessed, privileged and excited” to sign a two-year contract extension with the club. Under Klopp, the team are in the running for an unprecedented quadruple this season. What do we really know about ourselves?

4/29/2022,"The number of people not mowing their lawns is increasing after a successful campaign to keep gardens wild, a leading nature charity says. Gardeners are this year being urged once again by Plantlife to keep their lawnmower in the shed during No Mow May, in order to let wild plants thrive and provide nectar for insects. Thousands of people take part in Plantlife’s annual Every Flower Counts citizen science survey, the largest ever study of garden lawns in the UK. The charity says the results show a “radical shift in attitudes towards lawn management is under way”. It says 78.8% of 2,157 EFC participants last year did not mow for a month before taking part in the survey, an increase from 33.6% in 2019. People who chose not to mow were rewarded with rare plants. More than 250 wild plant species were recorded by gardeners last year, including wild strawberry, wild garlic and very rare plants including adder’s-tongue fern, meadow saxifrage, snakeshead fritillary and eyebright. Many orchids were also seen, including the declining ​man orchid, green-winged orchid, southern and northern marsh orchid and bee orchid. Ian Dunn, head of Plantlife, said: “These results demonstrate that our call to No Mow May has set seed and laid down deep roots. The results underline how embracing a little more wildness in our gardens can be a boon for plants, butterflies and bees. We are excited by the unfolding dawn of a new British lawn.” Plants considered weeds should be welcomed in lawns in summer, the charity added, especially those such as dandelions, which provide important nectar for pollinators. Despite being outnumbered by daisies 85 to one on a typical 2021 lawn, they produced 9% of its pollen and 37% of its nectar sugar. Plantlife said just eight dandelion flowers may produce enough nectar sugar to meet an adult bumblebee’s baseline energy needs. One 100 sq metre area of unmowed lawn, according to their plant study, would produce enough pollen to stock up six mining bee brood cells and enough nectar sugar to meet the needs of six bumblebees a day. After May, people with gardens and lawns are asked to mow less throughout the summer and preferably leave at least part of their garden untouched. Oli Wilson, a modeller at the National Plant Monitoring Scheme, said: “May is a crucial month for flowering plants that need to get a firm foothold but we are not advocating never mowing after May. Plantlife guidance across the year recommends a layered approach to the garden cut, where shorter grass is complemented by areas of longer grass. This two-tone approach boosts floral diversity and nectar and pollen production through the year.”",News/Environment,Mow problem: gardeners encouraged not to cut lawns in May,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/29/no-mow-may-gardeners-not-to-cut-lawns-wild-plants-insects
