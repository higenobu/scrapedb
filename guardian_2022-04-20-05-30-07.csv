4/20/2022,"Tampa Bay have brushed off a recent story that Tom Brady had been planning to move to the Miami Dolphins before he came out of a brief retirement to rejoin the Buccaneers this off-season. Stories in recent weeks claimed a plan had been in place for Brady to join the Dolphins as an executive before coming out of retirement to replace Tua Tagovailoa as the team’s starting quarterback. The Dolphins also allegedly intended to appoint former New Orleans head coach Sean Payton to run the team. A pre-determined decision to appoint Payton would have contravened the NFL’s Rooney Rule, which requires teams to interview a minority candidate for major coaching vacancies. The NFL is currently being sued by a number of Black head coaches who say teams gave sham interviews to minority candidates with no intention of appointing them. On Tuesday, Tampa Bay general manager Jason Licht said he had not discussed the story with Brady. “No, we haven’t had those discussions,” said Licht. “The only discussions I’ve had, we’ve had with Tom has been, he came back and we’re excited about this year and we’re excited to get going.” Licht added that the stories had not disturbed the Bucs’ preparations with Brady, head coach Todd Bowles and offensive coordinator Byron Leftwich for the new season, when they are expected to be contenders to reach the Super Bowl from a weak NFC. “I make of it … chatter, just like you said. We’re focused on putting our team together here with the draft and we’re all excited, we’re all in lock-step here - Tom, Todd, myself, Byron – the entire coaching staff – on this season,” said Licht. There had been speculation that Brady decided to come out of retirement after head coach Bruce Arians, with whom he is said to have clashed, stepped down for a role in the Buccaneers front office. “The philosophy hasn’t changed,” Licht said. “It’s just been meeting more with Todd more now as the head coach – more one-on-one and in some group settings too. Bruce has still been involved. He’s still been in our meetings. I meet with Bruce periodically and he’s gonna be involved here as we put the final touches on our draft too. Our philosophy hasn’t changed. We still wanna bring in really good players.”",Sport/Sport,Buccaneers dismiss ‘chatter’ over Tom Brady’s alleged Dolphins scheme,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/19/tampa-bay-tom-brady-miami-dolphins-plan-nfl

4/20/2022,"Keir Starmer called the prime minister “a man without shame” during furious exchanges in parliament as MPs prepared to vote on whether Boris Johnson should be investigated for lying about the Partygate scandal. Addressing MPs for the first time since receiving a fixed-penalty notice for attending a party thrown for his birthday in June 2020, Boris Johnson spoke of his humility but said it had not occurred to him that the gathering was a breach of Covid rules. In a fierce response, the Labour leader accused the prime minister of dishonesty and said he did not “respect the sacrifice of the British public”. The senior Tory MP Mark Harper became the latest backbencher to call for Johnson to go, after hearing his apology, saying: “I no longer think he is worthy of the great office that he holds.” MPs will vote on Thursday on a Labour motion that would trigger an investigation by the House of Commons privileges committee into whether Johnson misled parliament over a string of lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street. Starmer urged Conservative MPs to seize the opportunity to get rid of Johnson and “bring decency, honesty and integrity back into our politics”. In his statement to parliament, Johnson said he had broken the rules unwittingly. “It did not occur to me then or subsequently that a gathering in the cabinet room, just before a vital meeting on Covid strategy, could amount to a breach of the rules. That was my mistake and I apologise for it unreservedly,” he said. Johnson added that the “hurt and anger” prompted by the row had given him “an even greater sense of obligation to deliver on the priorities of the British people, and to respond in the best traditions of our country to Putin’s barbaric onslaught on Ukraine”. He said that he had been discussing the Ukraine conflict on Tuesday on a call with fellow world leaders, including presidents Biden and Macron. But Starmer called the apology “mealy mouthed,” and accused Johnson of being “dishonest”. When asked by the Speaker to withdraw that as unparliamentary language, Starmer said: “The prime minister knows what he is.” Harper also rejected Johnson’s apology, saying: “I regret to say that we have a PM who broke the laws that he told the country to follow, hasn’t been straight about it, and is now going to ask the decent men and women on these benches to defend what I think is indefensible.” Harper subsequently tweeted that he had already sent a letter of no confidence in Johnson to the chair of the 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady. However, other Tory MPs who have private reservations about Johnson said neither the apology nor move for a vote on an investigation by the privileges committee had shifted their view. They remain in a “holding pattern”, waiting to see if any further fines are issued and hopeful the facts will come out in Sue Gray’s long-awaited report. One Tory backbencher said they were considering voting for the privileges committee investigation but that it would probably be treated as a confidence vote, meaning they would lose the whip and probably their seat at the next election for doing so. Starmer cited the story of John Robinson, who wrote to the Guardian last week to say he could not hold the hand of his wife as she died, or hold a proper funeral for her, adding of Johnson: “Anger doesn’t even touch the sides of how I feel about this pathetic excuse for a man.” Starmer told a subdued House of Commons: “if the prime minister had any respect for John and the millions like him who sacrificed everything to follow the rules he’d resign. But he won’t. Because he doesn’t respect John. He doesn’t respect the sacrifice of the British public. He is a man without shame.” Labour sources said Starmer had returned from an Easter break with his family freshly enraged about the prime minister’s attempts to wriggle out of Partygate. Johnson will be on a trade visit to India when Thursday’s vote is held, as he seeks to demonstrate to colleagues that he is getting on with the job of running the country. In a signal that the Conservatives will whip their MPs firmly against the motion, the Cabinet Office minister Jacob Rees-Mogg cast doubt on the privilege committee’s suitability to investigate Johnson’s conduct. He said it was a “distinguished body of the House of Commons but it’s chaired by a Labour party politician”, and added: “I’d bear that in mind.” The committee is always chaired by an opposition politician. According to the ministerial code, ministers who “knowingly mislead parliament” are expected to offer their resignation. The prime minister reassured MPs in December that “all guidance was followed” in Downing Street during the pandemic – a statement apparently contradicted by the Metropolitan police’s decision to impose a fixed-penalty notice. Johnson has since argued that he did not knowingly mislead MPs because he had not believed rules were broken. Asked by the Tory MP Peter Bone: “Did you deliberately mislead the house at the dispatch box”, Johnson replied “No”. Another senior backbencher, Steve Baker, who has repeatedly criticised government Covid policy, suggested Johnson should be forgiven, stressing the need for “justice, and mercy, and humility” – though he asked Johnson for reassurance something similar could not happen again. The prime minister and senior government officials could face further sanctions in the coming weeks as the Met continues its investigation into lockdown gatherings. Once the Met has completed its work, the government has committed to publish the full report by Gray, a senior civil servant. One Conservative MP, Julian Lewis, urged Johnson to “authorise” Gray to publish it immediately and “put an end to this matter so that we do not get diverted away, as we are being, from such crucial questions as supplying armaments to Ukrainian democrats”. The prime minister said it was important for the Met to finish its work first.",News/Politics,Starmer calls Johnson ‘a man without shame’ as PM gives Partygate apology,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/19/starmer-johnson-man-without-shame-pm-partygate-apology
4/20/2022,"Boris Johnson should “pay close attention” to basic rules of cybersecurity, a former national security adviser has said, after it emerged that the United Arab Emirates was accused of hacking into a mobile phone at Downing Street. Peter Ricketts, who held the post between 2010 and 2012, said the cyber-attack demonstrated that “commercially made” Pegasus software from NSO Group allowed a “wide range of actors” to engage in sophisticated espionage. Anybody with access to secret information needed to be aware of the fast-changing risk, the peer added, including the prime minister, who was forced to change his mobile number last year after it emerged it had been available online. “It’s vital that anyone with access to sensitive material up to and including the PM have to pay close attention to the basic rules of cybersecurity, including their phone numbers,” Ricketts said. Johnson was forced to suddenly change his mobile phone last spring after it emerged that his number had been available online for 15 years. It was published on a thinktank press release from 2006 and never deleted. Pegasus is sophisticated software, made by the Israeli company NSO Group, that can covertly take control of a person’s mobile phone, take and copy data from it and even turn it into a remote listening device without their permission. But for it to be effective, it needs to be given a phone number to target. NSO Group said the allegations were “wrong and misleading” and the company denied involvement. “For technological, contractual and legal reasons, the described allegations are impossible and have no relation to NSO’s products,” the company said. There was no comment from the UAE. On Monday, Citizen Lab, a group of technology researchers based at Toronto University, said they had uncovered evidence of “multiple suspected instances of Pegasus spyware infections” within official UK networks including Downing Street and the Foreign Office. Using digital forensic techniques developed over several years, the researchers said they concluded the attack on Downing Street was “associated with a Pegasus operator we link to the UAE”, and took place on 7 July 2020. There is no firm evidence as to why the UAE may have wanted to target Downing Street on that date. However, a day earlier the British government announced a range of economic sanctions targeting 20 Saudi nationals accused of being involved in the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, plus individuals from Russia, Myanmar and North Korea. Neighbouring UAE is a close ally of Saudi Arabia. The UAE ambassador to London, Mansoor Abulhoul, denied reports that the UAE may have used spyware to hack into either Downing Street or the Foreign Office. He said: “These reports are totally baseless and we reject them. The UK is one of the UAE’s closest and dearest allies and we would never do such a thing to them.” He added he was shocked that the allegations had even been made, pointing to the recent enhancement of relations between the two countries, including a growing economic partnership. The denial is a reflection of the importance that the UAE attaches to the relationship, and the potential damage the espionage allegation could cause if it were given credence. One Citizen Lab researcher told the New Yorker, which first reported on the story, that it believed some data may have been stolen from Downing Street by the hackers. But the research group said it could not identify whether Johnson’s own phone or that of any other named official was targeted. The Foreign Office declined to discuss the story, saying: “We do not routinely comment on security matters.” But Citizen Lab said that it had alerted the UK, and officials from the National Cyber Security Centre are understood to have tested several phones but were unable to locate which one was compromised. Pegasus is sold to governments for counter-terror or national security purposes, but there have been repeated accusations that it has been used to spy on opposition politicians, human rights defenders and journalists by at least 10 countries, including the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Three civil society activists in Britain are in the process of bringing a civil claim against NSO Group, the UAE and Saudi Arabia, after an investigation by the Guardian and others that showed more than 400 phone numbers had been selected for potential targeting. Last year the high court and the court of appeal also ruled that “servants or agents” of sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the vice-president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, had engaged in “the surveillance of the six phones” in Britain – including of his former sixth wife, Princess Haya, with whom he was embroiled in a bitter divorce case, and her lawyer Fiona Shackleton. After the episode was discovered, in August 2020, NSO Group is understood to have rewritten its software to prevent Pegasus from being allowed to target UK numbers.",News/Politics,"Boris Johnson must pay attention to basic cybersecurity rules, says security adviser",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/19/boris-johnson-must-pay-attention-to-basic-cybersecurity-rules-says-security-adviser
4/20/2022,"The England captain Courtney Lawes is set to see a specialist to determine whether he will play again this season after sustaining a “nasty” hand injury, Northampton’s director of rugby, Chris Boyd, has revealed. Lawes sustained a compound dislocation of his left thumb in the European Challenge Cup quarter‑final defeat by Gloucester last Saturday and was replaced after just 15 minutes. Boyd did not put any sort of time-frame on the 33-year-old’s recovery, stating only that he will definitely not be in contention for the Premiership match against Bath on Saturday. His short-term absence is a blow for Northampton, who are chasing a top-four spot and a prolonged spell on the sidelines could hinder their push for the playoffs. England’s three-Test tour of Australia this summer is also coming into view and Eddie Jones, the head coach, will be desperate to have Lawes fit and firing, given he has captained the national side five times this term in Owen Farrell’s absence. When asked if Lawes would be back before the end of the season, Boyd said: “The hand specialist will come back and say X, Y or Z and whatever he says will happen. I’m not sure whether a scan will determine that but he certainly needs specialist consultation to see what the best course of action is going forward. “It [the injury] was quite nasty. The bone actually came out, but it either popped back in or it was put back in and it has been irrigated and sewn back up again. He has still got some medical decisions to be made around the skeletal function of the thumb and the muscle and ligament situation. “Until we get a clear medical view, all I can say is he won’t play on Saturday. He came into training today. He was disappointed. He didn’t want to look at it because he knew it was going to be a bit challenging. He’s as good as can be.” Lawes has already had an interrupted season, having missed the first two games of England’s disappointing Six Nations campaign because of a problem with his vestibular system, symptoms of which included headaches and “head‑rush”, which kept him out of action for six weeks. He returned to captain England in the narrow win against Wales, however, and counting in his favour Jones at the time referred to Lawes as someone who “tends to play pretty well fresh on to the paddock”.",Sport/Sport,Courtney Lawes could miss rest of the season with ‘nasty’ hand injury,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/19/courtney-lawes-hand-injury-northampton-rugby-union
