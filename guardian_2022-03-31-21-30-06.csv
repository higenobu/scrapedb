3/31/2022,"Penguin Classics is collaborating with Marvel to publish special editions of Black Panther, Captain America and The Amazing Spider-Man, marking the first time comics have been published by the imprint associated with classic works of literature. The series, called the Penguin Classics Marvel Collection, presents the original stories and seminal tales of key Marvel characters. According to the publishers, it “serves as a testament to Marvel’s transformative impact on graphic fiction and icons and stories across popular culture”. Each title will be published in black spine paperback as well as a collectable hardcover edition with gold foil stamping, gold edges and endpapers featuring artwork from the comics. They also include a foreword by a contemporary young adult author as well as a detailed scholarly introduction. The Amazing Spider-Man includes a foreword by Jason Reynolds, the New York Times bestselling author of books including Miles Morales: Spider-Man, Look Both Ways and Stamped: Racism, Antiracism and You. Reynolds was the US’s national ambassador for young people’s literature in 2020-21. Black Panther includes a foreword by Nnedi Okorafor, the multiple award-winning author of Who Fears Death and the Binti novella trilogy. She has written Black Panther and Wakanda Forever for Marvel Comics. And Captain America includes a foreword by Gene Luen Yang, a former national ambassador for young people’s literature and the author of Shang-Chi for Marvel Comics and the graphic novel American Born Chinese. Ben Saunders, the series editor and author of the scholarly introductions for Captain America and The Amazing Spider-Man, said: “The comics produced at Marvel in the 1960s can be compared to the most enduring popular music of that same tumultuous decade. Working at tremendous speed in what was widely regarded as a low-status commercial medium, the creators at Marvel initiated and participated in an aesthetic revolution.” According to Saunders, a professor of English at the University of Oregon, where he founded the world’s first undergraduate minor in comic studies, the comics have influenced writers and artists across all forms of media, “from contemporary novelists to hip-hop musicians to Hollywood film-makers. It is not hyperbole but simply a fact: these classic Marvel comics are foundational documents of our culture”. Jessica Harrison, the editorial director of Penguin Classics, said: “Penguin Classics are the books that have shaped our culture and changed how we see the world and ourselves. Whether via the medium of poetry, prose, drama or now comics, they speak as powerfully to readers around the globe today as they did in their own time and place. “For many decades, Marvel’s comics have enthralled audiences with a whole world of storytelling, visual artistry, ideas and social commentary. This is why readers return year after year to the stories of Spider-Man, Black Panther and Captain America – characters now as deeply engrained in our culture as the folk heroes of older literary traditions. We are thrilled to present Marvel’s classics as Penguin Classics, and to place the iconic work of Stan Lee, Steve Ditko, Jack Kirby and many other historic Marvel creators on shelves alongside the world’s greatest literature.” The first three books in the series, Black Panther, Captain America, and The Amazing Spider-Man will be published on 14 June.",Arts/Books,Marvel joins the literary canon in special edition by Penguin Classics,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/31/marvel-joins-the-literary-canon-in-special-edition-by-penguin-classics
3/31/2022,"EU leaders are being urged to tell China it will face sanctions if it offers military aid to Russia for the war in Ukraine, amid concern about a deepening authoritarian alliance that threatens the rules-based international order. Senior EU and Chinese leaders are expected to hold discussions at a video summit on Friday that is likely to be dominated by the war. EU diplomats said the the bloc’s representatives needed to pass on a message that Beijing would pay a price for any intervention in support of Russia’s war. “Our expectation is that the summit is not business as usual,” one senior EU diplomat said. “The message should be clear. Any military or financial support of China to Russia, also to circumvent sanctions, will have serious consequences for EU-China relations.” A second diplomat said the summit would be a defining moment that would shape the relationship between Brussels and Beijing for years to come. “It’s pretty clear that if they help Russia in the way that they provide weapons, or help circumvent sanctions, this will open up all kinds of possibilities, not least in a very firm transatlantic alliance,” the source said. “The EU won’t take it lightly if China openly takes sides with Russia,” they said, adding that there was a “big convergence” on the issue among the EU’s 27 member states. China has denied reports that it was prepared to provide Russia with weapons. Zhang Pei, a researcher at China Institute of International Studies, which is under China’s foreign ministry, said Beijing was alarmed in recent weeks by Europe “copying the US rulebook by claiming that China is considering providing military assistance to Russia”. China has accused the US of spreading misinformation. Beijing has abstained on UN security council resolutions condemning the war. It has also echoed, and amplified, Kremlin talking points in official media outlets, blaming Nato for the conflict and recycling conspiracy theories that the US and Ukraine had been pursuing a biological weapons programme together. China’s foreign ministry has insisted on what some western analysts see as “pro-Russia neutrality” approach. Three weeks before Russia launched its war on Ukraine, Vladimir Putin met his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, at the Winter Olympics in Beijing. They released a statement on 4 February that pledged a “no limits” partnership and declared there were “no ‘forbidden’ areas of cooperation”. EU diplomats are not convinced Xi was informed of Putin’s intention to wage a full-scale war on Ukraine and believe Beijing is worried about its Covid-hit economy, but they nevertheless see a new authoritarian axis emerging. At the Munich Security Conference last month, the EU’s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, described the China-Russia pact as an “act of defiance” and a “revisionist manifesto” against the rules-based international order and universal rights. Reinhard Bütikofer, the head of the European parliament’s China delegation, told reporters that EU-China relations were “more difficult and conflictual” than they had been in a long time. Beijing has imposed sanctions on Bütikofer and accused him of “pushing an anti-China agenda”. The 4 February statement was “clearly directed towards creating a new world order in which authoritarian great-power politics would dominate over the international rule of law”, he said, adding that “China has given political support to the Russian aggression against Ukraine”. “China abstained in two votes in the UN security council and the UN general assembly, but these abstentions can hardly shroud China’s abstention in ambiguity,” he said. “The veil is threadbare and it fools no one.” Bütikofer, a veteran German Green MEP, declined to be drawn on the details of possible sanctions against Beijing, but said “proof that China supports Russian military efforts in Ukraine … would have to trigger action by the European Union to punish China for that”. EU-China relations have been on a downward slide since 2020, when - pushed by the former German chancellor Angela Merkel - the bloc signed an investment deal with Beijing. The Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) quickly stalled in the European parliament, however, over concern about reports of human rights abuses against the Uyghurs and other mostly Muslim minorities in Xinjiang. European experts say that as long as MEPs such as Bütikofer remain on Chinese sanctions list, the CAI will not be revived. The Covid-19 pandemic has also accelerated European efforts to reduce its dependence on Chinese goods and supply chains. Casting a further chill is a diplomatic dispute between Lithuania and China, after the Baltic nation announced it was establishing mutual diplomatic posts with Taiwan. Outwardly at least China’s expectations of the summit are rather more positive. . The country’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, said on Wednesday that Beijing hoped it could “promote the sustained and sound development of China-EU relations and inject stability and positive energy into the complex and turbulent international situation”. Chinese state media have consistently blamed the US and Nato for pushing Moscow into starting the war in Ukraine, but Michael Reiterer, a former veteran EU diplomat and currently distinguished professor at Brussels School of Governance, said it was Putin who brought Nato back to life. “Macron had declared it brain dead, and Trump despised it,” he said.",News/World news,EU leaders urged to be tough on China if it supports Russia’s war in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/31/eu-leaders-urged-to-be-tough-on-china-if-it-supports-russia-war-in-ukraine
3/31/2022,"Spain’s conservative People’s party (PP) will gather in Seville on Friday and Saturday to install a new leader and attempt a “reboot” after almost four years of infighting, strategic errors and ideological flip-flopping that have left it in danger of being eclipsed by its rivals in the far-right Vox party. Pablo Casado, who has led Spain’s biggest rightwing party since July 2018, has been forced to stand down amid terminal discontent at the highest levels of the PP. That dissatisfaction came to a head in mid-February when Casado publicly announced that the party was investigating Isabel Díaz Ayuso, the PP president of the Madrid region – an outspoken politician often touted as his rival – for alleged corruption. The confrontation, which followed a disappointing result for the party in February’s regional election in Castilla y León, proved a miscalculation too far for Casado. This weekend, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, who won four consecutive terms as president of the north-western Spanish region of Galicia, will be voted in as Casado’s successor. The party hopes that Feijóo, who is habitually described as a moderate, will steer the PP back to the political centre-ground while still winning back the voters who have deserted the party in favour of Vox. The far-right party, which was founded nine years ago by former PP members, is now the third biggest grouping in parliament and is nipping at its parent party’s heels in the polls. “The party has been through a very difficult time and we’re going into the conference not to re-establish the party but to start over again,” said a PP source. “This conference is about switching off and resetting just as you would when your computer stops working.” They said the time had come “to heal wounds, end rifts and to come together for a greater aim, which is to give Spain a good government”. To do so, the party will set about highlighting its “centrist, reformist” history. “A big party has to try to pick up votes to its right and to its left; to be a catch-all party,” the source added. “We need to have a plurality of voices within the PP and we need those voices to talk to each other. The key – and this is what makes us a centrist party – is dialogue.” Casado, who pledged to “win back the hearts of all Spaniards” when he was elected, has had a complicated relationship with Vox. The outgoing leader dragged the PP further to the right to stop voters defecting to Vox, enlisted its support to prop up three PP-led regional administrations and recently gave the go-ahead for a PP-Vox coalition to govern Castilla y León. But he has also occasionally rounded on his sometime allies. In October 2020, he accused Vox of practising a politics based on “fear, anger, resentment and revenge” and of peddling a “demagoguery that offers easy – and usually fake – solutions to complex problems”. Such ideological lane-changing confused both PP voters and many within the party – as did the failed showdown with Ayuso. The PP’s internal squabbling has left the party unable to capitalise on discontent with Spain’s Socialist-led coalition government as the country suffers the highest rate of inflation since 1985, soaring energy prices and protests by farmers and hauliers. The aim now is to jettison the mistakes of the Casado era and start again in Seville. Although the PP source pointed out that parties across the European right were struggling to deal with the threat of a resurgent far right – “with varying degrees of success” – they said their own party needed to sound less like Vox and more like itself. The PP is keen to stress Feijóo’s track record as an experienced statesman who represents “the Spain of the constitution of 1978”, which enabled the country to transition to democracy after General Franco’s death. The same has not always been true of his predecessor. Despite a farewell speech to congress that lauded “national unity” and the importance of “respecting one’s adversaries”, Casado has previously stood in the chamber and described the Socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, as a “traitor, squatter, villain, catastrophe, hostage and compulsive liar’. His commitment to national unity has also been called into question by the time he inadvertently attended a mass at which prayers were said for Franco’s soul on the 46th anniversary of the dictator’s death, and by his contention that the Spanish civil war “a confrontation between those who wanted a democracy without law and those who wanted law without democracy”. Pablo Simón, a political scientist at Madrid’s Carlos III University, said he expected the PP’s change of leadership would be rewarded with “a mini-honeymoon” in the polls as the party prepares for this year’s key regional election in Andalucía, adding: “If the PP does well, that will give Feijóo a boost and help them with the Vox situation.” Simón said one of Feijóo’s biggest challenges would be balancing internal party pressures with the threat posed by its far-right rivals. “Feijóo’s obviously a liberal conservative who will talk about all the usual things – lowering taxes, moderation etc,” he said. “But for me the important thing will be which route he takes. Is he going to go: ‘Look, I’m going to do what the PP has always done and I’m going to start off by basing my agenda on economic issues’? Or is he going to get into the whole cultural war thing with Vox? I think the first option is more likely than the second.”",News/World news,Spain’s conservative People’s party to ‘reboot’ with new leader,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/31/spains-conservative-peoples-party-to-reboot-with-new-leader-alberto-nunez-feijoo
3/31/2022,"It was the slap that was heard around the internet – Will Smith’s outraged stage invasion at the Oscars had been seen more than 80m times online within three days. For professional comedians, however, it was the moment afterwards that struck home – Chris Rock in charge of an awards ceremony that has just gone so far south he can barely see it and it’s his job to get it back on track. And get a laugh. We asked four comics about the fears of the clown. Awards shows are never the most fun event on a comic’s calendar. The order of gigs you want to play go: one where all the people are there to see you; then all the people are there to see comedy; and then a long way down the list come industry awards such as the Oscars, where people are there for a reason that has nothing to do with you, they all know one another and wish you’d hurry up. You have to know what the audience will take, especially if you’re roasting the crowd. That’s quite an American tradition. We take the piss, but the roast means saying whatever you want to prick pomposity. It’s why Ricky Gervais does stuff at the Golden Globes he wouldn’t do at the Baftas. Rock did at least know the room. But if an awards gig goes wrong, it really goes wrong – although being hit on stage is very rare. I’ve only known two comedians get hit: one was a student gig with Brendon Burns. After the show, a girl went up and slapped him in the face. And Jim Jefferies has been punched twice – he nearly got knocked out at Jongleurs and was hit on stage once at the Manchester Comedy Store. That helped his career immensely – it was videoed and went viral. The worst moment for Rock would have been the five minutes afterwards when you think: “Well, I better try to get a laugh then.” I did a financial service awards, I was dying on my hole and I said: “Look, I’m just going to go because either I’m a terrible comedian or you’re a terrible audience. I’ve been a comedian for 20 years, how long have you been an audience?” And I walked off. Then the organiser goes: ‘Well, now you have to do the charity auction …’” Ed Byrne is now on tour with If I’m Honest I’ve hosted a lot of awards and you do sometimes have people get up on stage, blind drunk, and you know in your heart that they are about to do something that will probably lose them their job. It’s pretty much always taking the mic to make a speech, but there is no way that is going to end well for them. As I suspect Will Smith is discovering. Simply showing up to host an awards makes a comedian’s toes curl. Your instinct is to gently take the piss, but awards audiences are there because they take themselves very seriously just for that night. Even if it’s for the road lighting industry – surely there’s only one award? But you can’t say that. My worst was a pensions awards – 36 awards to get through. By the end of it, most of us were actually drawing our pensions. You have to detach emotionally. Keep smiling. But I’ve never actually seen a comic get slapped on stage in my career. Twenty years ago audiences were more volatile than today, and I saw a guy square up to a compere once, but it was bull elephant charging and he sat back down. The thing is you don’t know the backstory to offence. I have alopecia. Watching that joke, I can’t help but think that the slap wasn’t about the alopecia. I don’t have enough information on the ins and outs of their marital status but the alopecia element – well, it didn’t enrage me as an alopecia sufferer, but it did produce, ironically, one of the most hair-raising moments of television I’ve seen this year. Zoe Lyons hosts Lightning on BBC Two Awards shows are not a comedy audience, and the Oscars is probably the least comedic place. They do not put on those dresses and suits to have a laugh. Comedy and the Oscars are always in conflict – which is probably why comedy films never win Oscars. I thought Chris Rock did the best he could under very difficult circumstances. Most comedians have had enough experience to know when things have been pushed too far. You are always aware of the climate of the room 30 seconds into the gig. Rock was bringing a strong energy, campaigning for a response the crowd was very reluctant to give. It’s hard enough to deliver the perfect joke with the perfect timing – with situations like that, it’s very hard to plan for things going that badly wrong until they happen. You have two choices: respond in kind; or with an element of self-deprecation. If you want an evening like that to survive, you have to make the joke on you. Rock’s kneejerk response could have been to deal with Will Smith the way he would a heckler, because he has played hostile rooms, far more hostile rooms, during his career. But he took the self-effacing response to toxic masculinity, and it was the brave thing, the smart thing and the toughest thing to take the position of fool. If you remove the subtext or catalyst and make that moment about the simplest thing it was – a man taking offence at a joke, so he violently attacks the comedian – then it’s unforgivable. If we have an environment that allows you to assault a comedian making a joke that upsets you – if the repercussions of offence are violence – then free speech comes with a stipulation. Who decides what that stipulation is? Dane Baptiste hosts the podcast Dane Baptiste Questions Everything When you come at a comic, you come at a professional who has been booed off and slapped off and dealt with worse than you. Before I did standup, I was in the audience when someone threw a pint at Dave Fulton’s head. It smashed behind him and he just said: “If I’d known I was going to the zoo I’d have bought my bananas.” I thought: “If I can have this career, I would die happy.” I’ve been a fan of Will Smith for years but I felt so proud of Chris Rock. When it goes wrong, we still have a job to do. Sometimes, it’s telling jokes, sometimes it’s fighting fire. Rock showed his mettle as a standup. He stayed on stage, the camera closed up on his face and he was thinking: “Fix this, deal with everything later. Everyone in the room is expecting me to make everything OK again.” It was not about him, not about the fact that he’d been assaulted, it was about the crowd. I have had a heckler come on stage when I was very new, and she hissed in my face: “I pay your wages.” The promoter offered to take me out the back door, but I held my head up and walked past her at the bar. When the rug’s pulled from under our feet, a seasoned standup is still a gladiator. This won’t have been the first time Rock and Will Smith have met. Rock was the zebra in Madagascar and Jada was the hippo. There must have been wrap parties. There’s some beef there. Smith, he was so upset, as if he’d gone to the ceremony with a heap of other stuff. So I’m 100% a comic. Chris Rock was my hero. Will Smith … what’s going on, love?

3/31/2022,"As a kid, bored out of my mind on the long train journey from Edinburgh to London, I used to be totally baffled by all the adults just looking out of the window, barely moving for hours. What are they doing? What are they thinking about? How are they not bored? Now that I am older and my head is busier, I get it. When you’re travelling – on a long drive, waiting at an airport, staring out of the window of a train – thoughts tend to arrive in your head that you may otherwise never have time to consider. Given the opportunity, I reckon I could now spend most of a long-haul flight just having thoughts. Glitchhikers: The Spaces Between plays with this idea, putting you in transitional spaces – a highway, an airport, a train, a park – and giving you nothing much to do. It prompts your thoughts with its strange characters, who sit there calmly until you start up a conversation. They talk about stories and death, post-colonial ideas, the power of the collective, self-determination, our place in the universe and other subjects you might expect to come up in the kitchen at a fresher’s week party. I don’t say this unkindly; these are important ideas, but ones that many people will have turned over in their heads a lot before coming to this game and its in-between places. The nature of Glitchhikers and the brevity of its journeys means that there’s not much opportunity to go very deeply into any of these ideas. They’re conversation starters, really, and you’re supposed to have the conversation with yourself as much as with any of Glitchhikers’ surreal characters. One of them, for instance, is a dragon whose civilisation went under because all the dragons wanted to hoard wealth, and when there were no trinkets left to accumulate they started inventing new ones with computers, eventually destroying their planet. The allegory here is so paper thin that you could blow it away, but hey, when was the last time you played a game that encouraged its players to Google basic Marxism or think about the morality of cryptocurrency? Glitchhikers comes across as very thoroughly therapised at times. At one point the cyborg clerk at a roadside gas station wanted to check in with me and my feelings, and suggested I drink a glass of water and have a snack before we examined whether my environment or the people in it were making me feel unsafe. I did not personally encounter any themes, thoughts or conversations in my time with the game that made me feel anywhere near uncomfortable or sad enough to need this little self-care moment, but I’m nonetheless glad that it’s there, along with the links to vetted mental-health resources. Introspection can be hard, sometimes, especially if you’re not used to it. I’m glad this game exists, but I wish there were more to it. There wasn’t enough variety in the virtual landscapes or in the characters’ conversations to make the long night drives or train journeys appealing beyond the second or third go-around. It is a game that wants us to think about the contradictions and complexities of being alive on this Earth, but also, it doesn’t seem to come from a place of great life experience. I would be fascinated to see what these developers would make in another 20 (or 50) years.

3/31/2022,"Over the past four years, the number of counterfeit pills containing fentanyl that have been seized by US law enforcement jumped by 4,850%, according to a new study, underscoring how an alarming surge in the deadly drug is putting people at increasing risk for accidental overdose. The study by a consortium of academic researchers, led by New York University, was released on Thursday. Using a first-of-its-kind, real time analysis of federal data, it found that more than 2m fake pills were seized by officials in the last quarter of 2021 alone – up from 42,000 in the first quarter of 2018. Researchers also found that the number of individual seizures involving fentanyl pills increased by 834%. The authors say this reflects the huge supply of these pills, which criminal drug networks manufacture to look like legitimate pharmaceutical tablets such as Percocet, Xanax, and Adderall, being imported into the US and sold on the streets. “These look just like prescription pills – that’s the scary part,” said the study’s lead author Joseph Palamar, professor of population health at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. He said he worries about people who dabble in recreational drugs getting hit with deadly doses of fentanyl-tainted drugs. “One pill that contains fentanyl literally can kill you.” The study comes at a time when the number of overdose deaths in the US has exploded to over 100,000 per year due to the huge amounts of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids saturating the nation’s drug supply. Fentanyl is as much as 100 times more potent than morphine and, as Palamar notes, one small baggie of the stuff can contain enough of the drug to kill hundreds of people. In a two-month period in 2021, the US Drug Enforcement Agency announced it had arrested 810 drug traffickers across the United States and seized enough fentanyl-filled pills to kill more than 700,000 Americans. Researchers said the number of drug seizures is a reflection of the huge amount of fentanyl on the streets and warned of the dangers it can pose to unknowing members of the public, particularly young people who may be unwittingly buying fentanyl-tainted pills online or from friends. “Pills can disguise the risk,” said study coauthor Dr Daniel Ciccarone, a professor specializing in addiction medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. “A pill can be taken by a college student who is trying to stay up all night to study for an exam and doesn’t know whether his buddy is selling him real adderall or fake adderall. A pill can be taken by a kid who goes to a club and thinks he’ll have more fun if he takes the party drug MDMA – and instead he gets fentanyl.” Ciccarone and Palamar said people should avoid any pill that isn’t prescribed by their own doctor – including medicines given to them by friends or purchased over social media or on the street. At the very least, users of illicit drugs should consider testing them with fentanyl detection strips, available through many health departments and needle exchange groups, they said. “The street pill is now much more dangerous than it was for earlier generations,” said Cicarrone. “That is the problem.” The study’s innovative methodology analysed real time federal data on the drugs being seized by law enforcement on streets and at border crossings around the nation, in what researchers hope can become an early warning system for spotting new drug dangers on the market and even, heading off overdose deaths. “An increase in illicit pills containing fentanyl points to a new and increasingly dangerous period in the United States,” said Dr Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which funded the study. “Pills are often taken or snorted by people who are more naive to drug use, and who have lower tolerances. When a pill is contaminated with fentanyl, as is now often the case, poisoning can easily occur.” Young people have been particularly hard hit by recent drug overdose deaths. An earlier Guardian analysis showed youth under 24 have seen the fastest rise in drug deaths with 7,337 youth dying in 2020 alone. In California, where fentanyl deaths were rare just five years ago, a young person under 24 is now dying every 12 hours, according to a Guardian analysis of state data through June 2021 – a 1,000% increase over 2018. Some of the most tragic cases involve teenagers experimenting with pills obtained from social media or friends, which they think are pharmaceutical-grade painkillers or anti-anxiety medications, but which turn out to be deadly doses of fentanyl. “These kids are being deceived to death,” said Jaime Puerta, who organized the nonprofit Victims of Illicit Drugs to combat fentanyl deaths, after losing his own 16-year-old son to a counterfeit fentanyl pill. Puerta found his son Daniel Puerta-Johnson unconscious in his bedroom in 2020, after the teenager took what he thought was an Oxcontin pill that he bought over social media. The pill turned out to be fentanyl and left him brain dead, forcing the family to make the heartbreaking decision to remove him from life support. “Not enough is being done about it,” said Puerta, who has since talked to hundreds of other parents who lost young people to similar drug deaths. “I wish people would see it as what it is. It’s a national security crisis.” “People think this can’t happen to them, because they don’t have drug addicts in their families,” said Puerta, who wants to see more high school programs educating teenagers on the dangers. “But this is on the doorstep of every family.”",News/Society,"Number of fentanyl-filled pills seized by US law enforcement up 4,850%",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/31/fentanyl-overdose-us-law-enforcement
3/31/2022,"Pedro Almodóvar, whose film Parallel Mothers was nominated for two Oscars, has offered his verdict on this year’s ceremony. In a lengthy awards-week diary for IndieWire, Almodóvar gave an insider’s glimpse at proceedings from his seat in the stalls. Here, “very close to the protagonists” when Will Smith slapped Chris Rock for making a joke about his wife’s alopecia, “what I saw and heard,” wrote Almodóvar, “produced a feeling of absolute rejection in me.” This feeling lingered after the episode, he writes, particularly during Smith’s subsequent acceptance speech for best actor – “a speech that seemed more like that of a cult leader. You don’t defend or protect the family with your fists, and no, the devil doesn’t take advantage of key moments to do his work.” Almodóvar then took issue with Smith’s declaration that Denzel Washington had cautioned him in the aftermath of the slap, saying: “‘At your highest moment, be careful. That’s when the devil comes for you.’” “The devil, in fact, doesn’t exist,” wrote Almodóvar. “This was a fundamentalist speech that we should neither hear nor see. Some claim that it was the only real moment in the ceremony, but they are talking about the faceless monster that is the social media. For them, avid for carrion, it undoubtedly was the great event of the night.” The director was present in the Dolby theatre for almost five hours as he also attended the pre-telecast ceremony for eight craft categories, which he said was down to network ABC needing to “satisfy their spectators, who get bored to death when they don’t see a famous face (if possible on the verge of a nervous breakdown) and instead see unknown, emotional people who at that moment of their wins remember all their relatives with a drama as if they’ve been victims of a tsunami.” He took time out to try and cure his “tremendous headache” and to attempt to warm up, as “it is freezing cold in the stalls”. Both Nicole Kidman and Penélope Cruz were wrapped in their husbands’ jackets, lest they be “cryogenized”. However, he appears to enjoy himself more when speaking to Kenneth Branagh, who seems to apply to be cast in Almodóvar’s upcoming English-language debut, and Francis Ford Coppola, who “has slimmed down considerably”. He also joined a group including Javier Bardem and Al Pacino. “It’s a mass of talent. Javier doesn’t stop hugging him and Pacino smiles, delighted. I say: ‘You, Al Pacino. Me, Al Modóvar.’ Javier roars with laughter.

3/31/2022,"Hundreds of thousands of people with type 1 diabetes in England are to be offered a hi-tech skin sensor to monitor their blood sugar levels in seconds. The device, the size of a £2 coin, sits on a patient’s arm and constantly checks their glucose levels. It comes with an app that tells them whethertheir blood sugar levels are at an appropriate level. The technology also means patients can monitor their glucose levels over time so they can easily spot any worrying trends. The monitors are to be rolled out to all patients with type 1 diabetes in England when previously only three in five were eligible. Type 1 diabetes is an auto-immune condition that cannot be prevented and accounts for about 8% of all diabetes cases. Flash monitoring helps to improve blood glucose levels in patients, and also has a positive effect on their quality of life, according to research presented at the Diabetes UK Professional Conference 2022 this week. The rollout from the NHS in England follows approval from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), which said the wearable tech reduces the need for finger-prick testing by up to 50%. Some 250,000 people will benefit after Nice recommended the use of real-time continuous glucose monitoring for all adults and children with type 1. “These landmark guidelines promise to be transformational for people living with diabetes,” said Chris Askew, the chief executive at Diabetes UK. “What we are seeing today is a key shift in thinking – a move to recognising that technology is an integral part of diabetes management, not simply an added luxury.” Dr Paul Chrisp, the director of the centre for guidelines at Nice, said: “Many people find finger-prick testing to be painful and time-consuming and the introduction of technology for all people living with type 1 diabetes will reduce this considerably. “This group of people also live with the constant worry of suffering from an attack brought on by dangerously low blood sugar while they sleep. Having an alarm, which will alert them if this happens, will give them the peace of mind knowing they will wake up in the morning.” Prof Partha Kar, national NHS specialty adviser for diabetes for the health service in England, described the development as “the biggest step forward for type 1 diabetes care in years”.",News/Society,People with type 1 diabetes in England to be given skin sensor to monitor blood sugar,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/31/people-with-type-1-diabetes-in-england-to-be-given-skin-sensor-to-monitor-blood-sugar
3/31/2022,"Iseem to have spent most of 2022 ragging on all the terrible true-crime shows that have suddenly flooded streaming services, so it is only right that I should use this space to point out ones that are actually good. So allow me to present Netflix’s Trust No One: The Hunt for the Crypto King. Trust No One tells the story of QuadrigaCX, a cryptocurrency exchange that collapsed spectacularly without warning. Quadriga’s founder – an amiable goofball named Gerald Cotten – died without warning in India, and his death blocked people from accessing their money, which totalled hundreds of millions of dollars. Investors were angry, lives were ruined and so much was left unclear that a wealth of wayward theories about Cotten erupted. Was he murdered? Did he steal the money and fake his own death? Is he out there now, surgically altered and living on a private island? This makes great television. Once Trust No One hits its stride, it becomes a web of intrigue. It’s about cryptocurrency, a subject that is still cloudy enough to baffle most people. It’s about clearheaded investigation; the diligent checking of accounts to slowly piece together a complicated mystery. And it’s about the dangers of internet conspiracy, as evidenced by one of the talking heads: a man wearing a geometric fox mask to conceal his identity. Trust No One gets a lot of things right. The first is in picking its subject. Cotten died at the end of 2018, and this is a story so truly extraordinary that it has already caused something of a feeding frenzy. There have been countless news reports and magazine profiles on the subject. Last year, it was turned into the documentary Dead Man’s Switch: A Crypto Mystery, which aired on CBC in Canada and Discovery+ in the US, while Cotten’s death was also mined for the six-part podcast series A Death in Cryptoland. Yet everything still seems exciting and fresh. This could be because plenty of strands are still left dangling at the end. The worst true-crime documentaries (which is to say 75% of all true-crime documentaries) fail to set out their stall in any meaningful way. All the information they contain already exists elsewhere, which means they can be completely undone by 15 seconds of vigorous Googling. But, although the Quadriga case has reached some form of resolution, those who lost their money are still ruined, and many won’t be happy until Cotten’s grave is exhumed. One of the smartest decisions made by the producers is in showing you how easy it is to fall into this sort of magical thinking. In the moments it shows bitcoin going nuts for the first time, taking a few speculative investors and transforming them into overnight millionaires, the thrill is vicarious. When it temporarily crashes shortly afterwards, not only can you feel what a teetering house of cards the whole system is, but you can understand the desperate dives into rabbit holes that went on in a doomed attempt to recover what was theirs. The show is best summed up by one investor whose life savings were wiped out by Quadriga. Sitting in a room much smaller than the one he assumed he would have by now, he sighs: “Nobody has the patience to get rich.” The second big thing that Trust No One gets right is its length. Although producers must have thought about following prevailing trends and bulking Cotten’s story out into a formless multipart series, they kept the whole thing to a tight 90 minutes. The story is told at such a brisk pace that you can’t help but be swept up in it. It is a model of economy in a genre prone to excess.

3/31/2022,"The shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, has said refugees in Ukraine are facing “Kafkaesque” bureaucracy as they try to navigate Home Office visa requirements. Cooper had tabled an urgent question over the government’s two visa schemes, with MPs from both sides of the house rounding on the government. The shadow home secretary cited cases including those of a woman who had travelled “extensively” to fulfil the requirements, including to Warsaw to give biometric data; and a mother and son who had been granted a visa but then had it revoked. “This is Kafkaesque: what on earth is going on? Why is the home secretary so totally incapable of getting a grip on this?” Cooper asked. “Why on earth is it taking so long? Why are they still demanding reams of bureaucracy, reams of information? Tens of thousands of people are still stuck in the system. Families are desperate. People across the country have said they want to help, and yet the Home Office is letting them down.” The Home office minister Kevin Foster, answering MPs’ questions, said that “the trajectory of visas being granted every day is increasing”. He said there had been 23,500 visas granted to Ukrainians with family connections in the UK; and 3,705 under the Homes for Ukraine scheme – but said it was “too early to say” how many of those had actually arrived in the UK. In response to MPs’ questions, Foster conceded that the application forms were not available in Ukrainian. He said translating them would take “a reasonably significant amount of technical work”, and suggested it would then be difficult to find enough Ukrainian speakers to process them. A string of Conservative MPs, including the former ministers Stephen Hammond and Robert Jenrick, expressed concern at the slow pace of visa processing for the Homes for Ukraine scheme. Jenrick, the former housing secretary, said: “The vast majority of sponsors tomorrow will have waited two weeks and won’t have heard anything at all. We are testing the patience of people in this country who have put themselves forward as sponsors, and much more importantly, we’re letting down those vulnerable individuals and families in Ukraine.” MPs raised the cases of families waiting many days to see their applications processed; and of parents unable to travel because they did not have birth certificates or biometric data for babies and young children. The Scottish National party MP Stuart C McDonald called the bureaucratic hurdles faced by applicants on the ground in Ukraine, “clunky, bureaucratic and frankly traumatising”.",News/World news,"Ukraine refugees trying to get UK visas facing ‘Kafkaesque’ system, MPs told",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/31/ukraine-refugees-trying-to-get-uk-visas-facing-kafkasque-system-mps-told

It was very civil. Bhupendra We had an amiable conversation, agreeing on some issues, disagreeing on others. Joanne We talked about Priti Patel, because she is from the same background as he is. We have no love for her – it baffles me how she can be so right wing, given her background. Bhupendra I am a Ugandan Asian – we were thrown out by Idi Amin 50 years ago. Priti is unfortunately ruining our good name. Bhupendra In the past, when humans got injured or ill, they developed the ability to heal themselves with plants. Through trial and error, they said: this plant is good for headaches, or whatever. That’s how it evolved: traditional Chinese medicine, Ayurvedic medicine in India, and later, in the west, homeopathy. It is fine, up to a point, if you want to do it, but there is no evidence for it. Joanne Samuel Hahnemann invented homeopathy in Germany in the 1800s. The basic idea is like treating like; what makes you bad can make you better. Bhupendra What’s happened in the last few hundred years is the evolution of what we call the scientific method, which has delivered products and benefits for humanity that are obvious. It relies on robust evidence, placebo-controlled trials, etc. That is my personal training, having spent a lifetime in pharmaceuticals. Joanne The dilution process happens because the water has memory – that’s what we work with. And the body just needs a trigger: things that will create an immune response. Bhupendra I wasn’t surprised when she said there was no funding to do research to advance homeopathy. No one is going to do that unless you provide your funders with clear evidence of benefits. You can’t do that with homeopathy. Joanne I am not an anti-vaxxer – I am pro-choice. But I have never gone for vaccines. I believe my own immune system will deal with an infection. I’ve just done a test after finally getting Covid in November, and I have really strong antibodies. I was poorly for six days, but the cough went away with homeopathy. The backache was the worst, but rhus tox [a homeopathic remedy derived from poison ivy] sorted that out. My son had to be vaccinated for his job, and my husband because he travels. It’s up to them.Bhupendra This is a pandemic, and we live in a society, so all of us have a responsibility to protect ourselves and everyone else. Bhupendra We agreed on Brexit, immigration and the royal family. Why are we hanging on to an institution that doesn’t have any meaning – privilege on the basis of genetics. We are an advanced, technological, rich country. Why are we stuck to such a medieval approach? Joanne Neither of us is a fan of the royal family, but I think we disagreed on what would be the alternative. I wouldn’t want Boris Johnson or Tony Blair or any of them as head of state – that would be frightening. So I just think, reduce the royal family, have the head of state and a wife or husband, and leave it at that. All the hangers-on? No, I don’t think so. Bhupendra I enjoyed the conversation. You learn about people, perspectives and points of view. That’s not to say I changed my mind. Joanne I was brought up to debate.

3/31/2022,"The master tactician Ben Affleck had it right. “Act as if,” his stockbroker character tells a room full of callow recruits in the 2000 film Boiler Room. “Act as if you are the fucking president of this firm.” Gregg Berhalter’s blossoming young squad are now entering their Affleck phase after a fitful but successful Concacaf qualifying campaign that ended with Wednesday’s 2-0 loss away to Costa Rica. With the core task accomplished, it’s time for a mentality shift. It’s not just getting your foot in the door, it’s acting as if you belong inside, and proving it. Looking the part, and playing it. That will be the challenge for the US in Qatar against more experienced opponents, and there are hints that Berhalter’s men are evolving assertively in that direction, even as they squeezed through with a draw, a win and a loss over the past week. Triumph in defeat was a suitably dissonant note to conclude this qualifying campaign. The deepest and most gifted generation of US men’s players ever assembled finished third in the standings, only avoiding a playoff by virtue of goal difference. The US ended below Canada, an outcome that would have seemed preposterous before the Octagonal stage began last September. They also finished beneath Mexico despite a merited superior recent head-to-head record. In this qualifying cycle, humility and insecurity were byproducts of the shocking failure to make the 2018 tournament after seven successive appearances. No longer could Wednesday night’s headline news – the US are going to a World Cup – read like a statement of the obvious, a routine matter. Qualification has at times been couched not as the pursuit of a positive achievement but as an exercise in disaster prevention. Even as US Soccer adopted the slogan “Only Forward”, the caution and concern were palpable. Take February’s deep-freeze diffidence, when the US decided that they were so in need of a little extra home advantage against Honduras, the Octagonal’s worst and only winless team, that they scheduled what proved to be a farcical fixture in frost-bitten Minnesota. That’s not acting as if you’re the 13th best team in the world hosting the 78th, per Fifa’s latest ranking. Last September, when the US were 1-0 down to Honduras at half time (ultimately winning 4-1), having opened their campaign with draws against El Salvador and Canada, it was even tempting to wonder whether Berhalter might meet the same fate as Jurgen Klinsmann: ousted early in a stuttering qualifying campaign. Despite the blemishes of defeat away to Panama and Canada, and the usual loss in Costa Rica, the performances against Mexico have been the most instructive guide to this team’s potential: energetic, ambitious and undaunted. The 2-0 win in Cincinnati last November, their third victory over El Tri in 2021, secured with late goals from Christian Pulisic and Weston McKennie, was vibrant. The goalless draw in Mexico City last week was, finishing aside, a more impressive display than the 5-1 victory over Panama in Orlando last Sunday. That point also provided what proved a vital cushion for the game in Costa Rica: it meant the US could afford to lose, even by five goals, and still avoid a playoff against New Zealand in Qatar. Though two second-half goals settled Wednesday’s match, with set-piece defending and goalkeeper Zack Steffen at fault, it was overall a bright display from an American side who must have been exhausted but were patently disappointed to lose. Canada, the group winners, have played with greater purpose and joy in comparison. A less intricate tactical approach based on rapid counter-attacks is surely a factor. So too is less pressure – after all, Canada’s only other World Cup appearance came in 1986 and they did not even reach the final qualifying round in the previous cycle. Also relevant is that the US under Berhalter have been a perpetual work in progress – a “process”, as he likes to say. In 50 games in charge the head coach has used 88 different players. Of those, 21 have made only one appearance. There’s no lack of choice, no shortage of footballers at high-level clubs. Julian Green, who scored the US’s most recent World Cup goal in the second-round loss to Belgium in 2014, has played 17 times in the Bundesliga this season and is still only 26 years old, yet has not featured under Berhalter. No wonder it’s been hard to ascertain much of an identity beyond “young and promising” – the team has been a constant construction site. In Pulisic, Sergino Dest, McKennie, Tyler Adams, Gio Reyna, Yunus Musah, Brenden Aaronson and Tim Weah, the head coach has players who look capable of excelling on the biggest stage (if healthy). There are question marks at goalkeeper and centre forward, and the centre backs must prove they can handle the step up from regional to global standard. Pre-tournament friendlies against high-level opponents, if they can be arranged, should be clarifying in that respect. But the US squad for the 2014 World Cup had an average age of 27.3 years. The oldest of the eight listed above, Pulisic and McKennie, will be 24 when Qatar kicks off. Berhalter’s top talents are yet to peak. The stand-out from that big win over Panama in Florida, which all but sealed qualification, was a hyper-caffeinated Pulisic, who claimed his first senior international hat-trick. It wasn’t only the goals, though. It was the attitude of a player embracing the responsibility of the captain’s armband, willing to shoulder the heft of the occasion and lead by example. It was, as Affleck’s character might have said, presidential stuff. Now let’s see how far and fast this group can go.",Sport/Football,The USMNT are back at the World Cup.
