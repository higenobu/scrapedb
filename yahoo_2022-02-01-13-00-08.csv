2/1/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The threat to the West from the Chinese government is “more brazen” and damaging than ever before, FBI Director Christopher Wray said Monday night in accusing Beijing of stealing American ideas and innovation and launching massive hacking operations. The speech at the Reagan Presidential Library amounted to a stinging rebuke of the Chinese government just days before Beijing is set to occupy the global stage by hosting the Winter Olympics. It made clear that even as American foreign policy remains consumed by Russia-Ukraine tensions, the U.S. continues to regard China as its biggest threat to long-term economic security. “When we tally up what we see in our investigations, over 2,000 of which are focused on the Chinese government trying to steal our information or technology, there’s just no country that presents a broader threat to our ideas, innovation, and economic security than China,” Wray said, according to a copy of the speech provided by the FBI. The bureau is opening new cases to counter Chinese intelligence operations every 12 hours or so, Wray said, with Chinese government hackers pilfering more personal and corporate data than all other countries combined “The harm from the Chinese government’s economic espionage isn’t just that its companies pull ahead based on illegally gotten technology. While they pull ahead, they push our companies and workers behind,” Wray said. “That harm — company failures, job losses — has been building for a decade to the crush we feel today. It’s harm felt across the country, by workers in a whole range of industries.” Chinese government officials have repeatedly rejected accusations from the U.S. government, with the spokesman for the embassy in Washington saying last July that Americans have “made groundless attacks"" and malicious smears about Chinese cyberattacks. The statement described China as a “staunch defender of cybersecurity.” The threat from China is hardly new, but it has also not abated over the last decade. “I’ve spoken a lot about this threat since I became director"" in 2017, Wray said. ""But I want to focus on it here tonight because it’s reached a new level — more brazen, more damaging, than ever before, and it’s vital — vital — that all of us focus on that threat together. The Justice Department in 2014 indicted five Chinese military officers on charges of hacking into major American corporations. One year later, the U.S. and China announced a deal at the White House to not steal each other's intellectual property or trade secrets for commercial gain. In the years since, though, the U.S. has continued to level accusations against China related to hacking and espionage. It's charged Chinese hackers with targeting firms developing vaccines for the coronavirus and with launching  a massive digital attack of Microsoft Exchange email server software, and also blacklisted a broad array of Chinese companies. In his speech, Wray recounted the case of a Chinese intelligence officer who was convicted of economic espionage for targeting an advanced engine by GE that China was working to copy. But there have also been some setbacks. Though the FBI director mentioned Monday night that the bureau was working to protect academic research and innovation at American colleges and universities, he did not discuss the much-criticized China Initiative. That Justice Department effort was created in 2018 to counter economic espionage and to protect against research theft, but critics have accused investigators of scrutinizing researchers and professors on the basis of ethnicity and of chilling academic collaboration. Earlier this month, prosecutors dropped a fraud case against a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor, saying they could no longer meet their burden of proof. The department is in the process of reviewing the fate of the China Initiative, and expects to announce the results soon. ___ Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP",World/Associated Press,FBI chief: Threat from China 'more brazen' than ever before,https://news.yahoo.com/fbi-chief-threat-china-more-025956448.html
2/1/2022,"If Donald Trump is right that former Vice President Mike Pence could have single-handedly tossed out the results of the 2020 presidential election, that means current Vice President Kamala Harris gets to choose the next president, quipped Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.). Pence did not — nor will Harris — have the right to unilaterally pick a president regardless of voters’ choice. But Lofgren was mocking Trump’s claim. If it were up to a vice president — and not the nation’s voters — to choose the next president, a political party would never quit the Oval Office. “I guess the former president is saying that the vice president gets to choose the next president,” Lofgren said Sunday on CNN. (Check out the video above at 1:40.) “In which case, Kamala Harris will be presiding at the [next] counting of the [electoral] votes. I guess he’s saying she gets to chose who the next president is.” Lofgren, a member of the House select committee investigating the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, added, smiling: “That’s clearly not what the Constitution provides for. He must be kidding.” He didn’t sound like he was kidding. Pence “did have the right to change the outcome” of the presidential election, Trump said in a statement Sunday. “Unfortunately, he didn’t exercise that power, he could have overturned the Election!” MSNBC’s Ari Melber early last month challenged Trump’s former trade adviser Peter Navarro, who also boldly discussed plans to overthrow the presidential election. Melber accused Navarro of maneuvering to leverage the remaining “incumbent losing party`s power” to “reverse” Trump’s defeat. “Do you realize you`re describing a coup?” Melber asked. “If the incumbent administration, through the president or the vice president, could just cancel the election outcome ... then a lot of people would try to stay in power,” Melber added. “We have an entire system designed to thwart” that idea. Trump’s critics on Twitter — tongues firmly in cheek — loved the idea of Harris picking the next president, just the way the former president thinks it ought to be.

2/1/2022,"In January 1989, two US Navy F-14s clashed with Libyan MiG-23s over the Mediterranean Sea. The F-14s downed both MiGs in what was one of several clashes between US and Libyan forces in the 1980s. The air-to-air victory became a headache for the Pentagon, which had to defend the decision to fire on the Libyans. On January 4, 1989, the US Navy aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy was sailing through the Mediterranean Sea with multiple aircraft from its air wing aloft for training exercises and patrol missions — a common practice while carriers are at sea. At 11:55 a.m., one of those planes, an E-2C Hawkeye airborne early warning and control aircraft, detected two Libyan Air Force MiG-23s taking off from an airbase in northeast Libya and heading toward the carrier. Two nearby F-14 Tomcats were ordered to intercept the MiGs. The air battle that followed was a victory for the Tomcats, but it soon became a headache for the Pentagon. By the late 1980s, US-Libya relations had deteriorated, driven in part by territorial disputes in the Mediterranean. In 1973, Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi claimed almost all of the Gulf of Sidra as territorial waters and declared that any crossing of his ""Line of Death"" would receive a military response. The US categorically rejected the declaration and conducted freedom-of-navigation exercises with warships and aircraft in defiance of Gaddafi's claim. Consequently, there were a number of intercepts and standoffs in the airspace and waters around Libya, some of which turned violent. In 1981, US Navy carrier aircraft shot down two Libyan Su-22 fighter-bombers in the Gulf of Sidra. In March 1986, a clash with the US Navy left dozens of Libyan troops dead and multiple Libyan ships sunk or damaged. That April, the US bombed dozens of Libyan targets, including Gaddafi's residence, in retaliation for a Libyan-sponsored terrorist attack in Berlin. All the while, Gaddafi continued supporting terrorist groups with training, equipment, and financing. In 1988, the situation became even more tense when the US accused Libya of attempting to build a chemical-weapons plant. USS John F. Kennedy was sailing to Haifa for a scheduled port visit amid those tensions, but the carrier was not in the Gulf of Sidra. It was actually some 120 miles north, closer to Crete. Regardless, two Libyan MiG-23s from Al Bumbah airfield near Tobruk were dispatched and flying toward its general location. The two Navy F-14s tasked with intercepting them, call signs Gypsy 207 and Gypsy 202, arrived in radar tracking range within minutes. Soon the four aircraft were approaching each other some 70 miles from Tobruk. Flying at high speeds, the F-14s conducted a series of turns and lowered their altitude. The Libyans matched these turns and even accelerated to ensure they were approaching the Tomcats head on. As the MiGs closed in, the Americans worried they might be carrying Soviet-made AA-7 Apex missiles, which have a 12-mile range. Kennedy's air-warfare commander warned the pilots that the MiGs could be preparing to attack and gave them permission to fire if they felt the aircraft were hostile. The Tomcats had taken position underneath the MiGs, which allowed them to use ocean clutter to confuse their radar — a tactic learned by training against secretly acquired MiG-23s back in the US — and made five more turns that were matched by their Libyan opponents. Now less than 20 miles from the Libyan jets, the Americans armed their weapons. At 13 miles, the radar intercept officer aboard Gypsy 207, Cmdr. Leo Enwright, fired an AIM-7 Sparrow at one of the MiGs — without telling the pilot, Cmdr. Joseph Connelly, beforehand — but the missile failed to track. Enwright fired a second missile at 10 miles, which also failed. The two F-14s then conducted a defensive split — Gypsy 207 turned left and Gypsy 202 turned right. The MiGs turned and headed straight for Gypsy 202, whose radar intercept officer, Lt. Cmdr. Steven Collins, fired an AIM-7 that hit one of the MiGs at a range of roughly 5 miles. Observing the kill, Connelly radioed ""good hit, good hit on one!"" Gypsy 207 then took position behind the other MiG and, after some difficulty acquiring a lock and some colorful language, fired an AIM-9 Sidewinder that brought down the Libyan fighter. ""Good kill! Good kill!"" Connelly transmitted. Gypsy 202's pilot, Lt. Herman Cook III, responded: ""OK, good kill."" Before returning to the carrier, the F-14s both reported seeing the Libyan pilots eject and deploy parachutes. Though a victory, the shoot-downs became a bit of a headache for the Pentagon and the Reagan administration. After the incident, Libya claimed the Americans had shot down two unarmed reconnaissance planes. Gaddafi claimed it was ''official US terrorism"" and called for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to condemn the US's actions. Other Arab officials, including Yasir Arafat, said the incident would negatively affect Arab-American relations and set back the Middle East peace process. The Pentagon repeatedly defended the actions of the F-14 crews, saying that the MiGs displayed ""clear hostile intent"" and that the US jets were justified in firing. ""If anything, they fired too late,"" Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci said. The US Navy also released footage from one of the F-14s showing that at least one of the MiGs was armed with two AA-7 Apex missiles and two AA-8 Aphid missiles. A Pentagon spokesman said the video proved that Libya's claims about the US shooting down reconnaissance aircraft were lies, though media reports at the time noted that the video was blurry. The Pentagon did admit that the MiGs never turned on their on-board radars needed to guide their Apex missiles toward the US jets. Rep. Les Aspin, chairman of the US House Armed Services Committee, later said that according to secret Pentagon briefings and discussions with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and other government officials, the MiGs' turns were too slight to be considered hostile. Aspin and Navy aviators interviewed at the time also raised doubts about the Pentagon's characterization of the F-14's actions as ""avoidance"" maneuvers. The pilots said they appeared to be standard intercept maneuvers. However, Aspin did say that the F-14s' actions were justified given the speed at which the MiGs were approaching and the Libyans' record of shooting first in previous engagements. The Libyan pilots' mission remained unclear after incident and was not likely to ever be known, Aspin said in March 1989, and while the Libyan pilots were seen ejecting and parachuting into the sea, it's not known if they were ever recovered.

2/1/2022,"ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — The former suburban Minneapolis police officer who said she confused her handgun for her Taser when she killed Daunte Wright should face a sentence above the state’s guidelines because she abused her authority as a police officer and endangered others when she fired her weapon, prosecutors said in a court filing Monday. But defense attorneys for Kim Potter say she should get a lower sentence — or even probation — because she has had an exemplary career, has led a crime-free life and has has been contrite. “She expressed remorse and apologized to Mr. Wright’s family from the stand, and will again at sentencing,"" her attorneys wrote. Potter, who is white, was convicted in December of first-degree and second-degree manslaughter for fatally shooting the 20-year-old Wright during an April 11 traffic stop in Brooklyn Center as she and other officers were trying to arrest him on an outstanding warrant for a weapons possession charge. Video of the shooting from police body cameras and dashcams showed that Wright, who was Black, pulled away while another officer attempted to handcuff him. Potter repeatedly said she would tase him, but instead shot him once in his chest with her gun, which was in her hand. Potter is scheduled to be sentenced Feb. 18. Under Minnesota statutes, she will be sentenced only on the most serious charge of first-degree manslaughter, which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years. But state sentencing guidelines call for much less. For someone with no criminal history, like Potter, the guidelines range from just more than six years to about 8 1/2 years, with the presumptive sentence being slightly over seven years. In order for Judge Regina Chu to issue a sentence that’s outside the guideline range, she would first have to find either mitigating or aggravating factors. Prosecutors say aggravating factors justify a sentence above the guidelines. Among them, they say, Potter caused a greater-than-normal danger to others. After Wright was shot, his car traveled forward and struck another vehicle. Wright's passenger suffered a broken jaw, concussion and other injuries, and the passenger of other car was also hurt and has been in declining health since the crash, requiring hospice care, prosecutors said. Prosecutors said those injuries were “directly attributed to Defendant's reckless conduct.” They added that Potter also created a danger to her fellow officers when she fired while they were nearby. Prosecutors also say Potter abused her authority as an officer, writing: “Rather than using only reasonable force, Defendant blindly drew her duty handgun and fired a bullet through Mr. Wright’s heart, killing him. As a result, Defendant abused the faith, trust, and authority that had been placed in her by virtue of her special position as a police officer.” The defense disagreed, saying Wright chose to flee, which caused the crash, and Potter can’t be held responsible for his decision. They said she did not abuse her authority, “She had no intent to harm. She did not know she had a gun in her hand. Nor did she foresee the unfolding tragedy.” Defense attorneys are asking for a sentence that's either below the guideline range, or probation, saying she that as a former officer she would be “a walking target” in prison. They also said her risk of committing the same crime again is low because she is no longer a police officer. Her attorneys also wrote that imposing a prison sentence “sends the message that if an officer makes a mistake, the Attorney General will be quick to charge… and that officer will be immediately ruined by the publicity alone.” ___ Find the AP’s full coverage of the Daunte Wright case: https://apnews.com/hub/death-of-daunte-wright",U.S./Associated Press,State seeks long sentence for cop convicted in Wright death,https://news.yahoo.com/state-seeks-long-sentence-cop-014018059.html
