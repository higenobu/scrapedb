3/16/2022,"There was absolutely no chance that the first of the Czech Philharmonic orchestra’s two concerts in London this week would be anything other than a special occasion, for musical and non-musical reasons alike. And so it proved. As the first international orchestra to play in the Barbican Hall since the start of the pandemic, the Czechs would have drawn full houses anyway, especially in programmes featuring three of their greatest native composers. But the invasion of Ukraine supercharged the opening evening even more. Czechs know better than anyone what a Russian invasion is like. The orchestra rose to the occasion with its trademark warm intensity of tone, but also with flashes of a rare fire. Before the interval, Yuja Wang gave a terrific account of Rachmaninov’s first piano concerto, combining the necessary weight of tone in the opening movement with the fleetest of fleet fingerwork in the finale. Semyon Bychkov was a responsive accompanist, drawing lovely string sound from the orchestra. It was a fine, high quality international concert performance, but of a recognisable and familiar kind. The music-making in the second half felt altogether more momentous, electrifying in a larger way. From the podium, to huge applause, Russian-born Bychkov made a short speech dedicating the performance of this orchestra’s signature work, Smetana’s Má Vlast, “to the people of Ukraine”, before conducting the Ukrainian national anthem with the entire audience on their feet. After that buildup, the performance itself might just have been an anticlimax. No such danger. The Czechs have Smetana’s six movement evocation of their homeland in their bones, and they delivered it with real feeling. The expertly scored romantic early movements, with their harps and woodwind solos evoking the Bohemian landscape, flowed expressively. But the more muscular two closing sections, in which Smetana builds the music around a steadfast and patriotic Hussite hymn of defiance, had an unmissable wider message for Europe today.",Arts/Music,Czech Phil/Bychkov/Wang review – an electrifying evening of unity and defiance,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/16/czech-phil-bychkov-yuja-wang-barbican-review-an-electrifying-evening-of-unity-and-defiance
3/16/2022,"The Russian television producer who staged an extraordinary anti-war protest live on national television has said in her first interview since that she is extremely concerned about her safety but stands by her actions. “I believe in what I did, but I now understand the scale of the problems that I’ll have to deal with and, of course, I’m extremely concerned for my safety,” Marina Ovsyannikova told Reuters in a televised interview. Ovsyannikova, who was a senior producer at Channel One, staged her protest on air on Monday night when she waved sign reading: “Don’t believe the propaganda. They’re lying to you here.” She also released a pre-recorded video in which she expressed her “shame” at working for Channel One and spreading “Kremlin propaganda”. A Russian court fined Ovsyannikova 30,000 roubles (£215) on Tuesday for her recorded video in which she violated protest laws. The decision was met with relief by friends and supporters who feared the authorities were preparing serious criminal charges after she disappeared into police custody for nearly 24 hours after her arrest. She has not yet been prosecuted for her live protest on Channel One. Ovsyannikova told Reuters she “did not feel like a hero,” and that she hoped her “sacrifice was not in vain and that people will open their eyes”. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy and western leaders have joined Russians opposed to the war in applauding her protest. She also told Reuters her actions were intended to send a direct message to the Russian public: “Don’t be such zombies, don’t listen to this propaganda. Learn how to analyse information, learn how to find other sources of information, not just Russian state television.” The Guardian earlier learned that Ovsyannikova had outlined her protest plan to a friend the day before, having become increasingly angry about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. She also told her friend she was fully aware of the consequences her actions would have on her and her family.",News/World news,Russian TV producer ‘extremely concerned’ for safety after protest live on air,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/16/russian-tv-producer-marina-ovsyannikova-extremely-concerned-for-safety-after-protest-live-on-air
3/16/2022,"The ascent of so-called “elevated horror”, a nonsense term vaguely referring to a loose collection of films that smack of the highbrow in a way that your average down-and-dirty murder-fest does not, has yielded a handful of strong entries. But the flip side of that blood-flecked coin has been an increased privileging of subtext over text, as the most dreary of the bunch get bogged down in their smarty-pants metaphors at the cost of the genre’s more immediate pleasures. Too many perfectly good premises have been squandered, so busy pondering the lingering effects of trauma that they forget to scare the bejesus out of their viewers. With its unabashed focus on bodies, luring us in with their nudity before hacking them into tiny pieces, the back-to-basics slasher X arrives as a bold rebuke to all things staid and dignified. When a film-maker opens their movie with a van’s worth of fresh-faced 70s porn stars stopping for an ominous gas-up at a petrol station en route to a secluded house in the woods, a promise is made. There will be skin, and then we’ll get to watch as it’s lacerated. West delivers on that unspoken compact and then some, generally with a winning spirit of invention and inspiration calibrated for maximum audience response. If there’s a deeper meaning at play in this face-off between the merry band of degenerates and the fundamentalist oldsters picking them off, it concerns the freedom to indulge in all things prurient and lurid without shame, a god-given right exercised in gleeful fashion here. Art, trash, prestige – these are all just words, and they’re holding us back. As stated by RJ (Owen Campbell), the director and camera operator on film-within-the-film The Farmer’s Daughters, sex and violence don’t cancel out merit. He explains that creative editing strategies and cinematography can class up even the lowest-rent subject matter, an overbearing bit of reflexive commentary typical of the script’s tendency to veer from clever to self-satisfied. (If you have already name-checked Psycho, nicking its car-in-the-swamp shot is just double dipping.) But the point stands, proven by the accomplished sleaze of this period homage. A star-spangled title card announces that it’s 1979, and the decade’s horror classics fill West’s formal playbook. In its woozily-composed wide shots and stutters of cross-cutting that form a messy suture between scenes, his technique makes for a far savvier Texas Chainsaw Massacre than last month’s reboot on Netflix. There’s a perverse, playful quality to the finest set pieces, as in the aerial shot watching with indifference while an alligator stalks an oblivious Maxine (Mia Goth). The up-and-coming actor has her sights set on a life of fame and fortune, egged on by her boyfriend Wayne (Martin Henderson), who also happens to be the producer of their shoestring operation. His studly leading man is Jackson Hole (Scott Mescudi, rocking little more than a magnificent Afro and his taut buttocks), coming soon to a social media feed near you for his out-of-nowhere acoustic guitar cover of Fleetwood Mac’s Landslide. Also in tow is his lover and scene partner Bobby-Lynne (Brittany Snow), and the crew’s black sheep Lorraine (Jenna Ortega). RJ’s girlfriend and boom operator, she’s got a few reservations about being party to smut-peddling, a friction that the writing never quite figures out how to use. All the furtive rutting rouses the suspicions of the fossils renting out the cabin on their farm, whose pious repression drives them to kill, as if illustrating what happens without a healthy diet of sin. As villains, they are not all that chilling unto themselves; the climax’s suggestion that the ultimate vision of horror is naked old people is neither new nor persuasive. Even so, they’ve got the moves, guided by the confident hand of West’s direction. He flashes the proficiency in blocking for suspense that has been in short supply since 2009’s The House of the Devil, another effort to evoke the golden age of gutbucket horror. In both cases, he comes up short only in texture. The original Texas Chainsaw Massacre still feels like a relic from a lost civilization, and the winky final lines of X reach for that same air of discovering something we were never meant to see. The look is just a touch too polished for that, however, far removed from the high-contrast coarseness of your given grind-house programming. Though the qualifications are piling up like so many corpses, they don’t really get in the way of the good time West has prioritized. He vocally sets his goal as a meat-and-potatoes slice-and-dice, and even offers a solid defense of that as a legitimate aspiration. This isn’t a reinvention of the wheel, but a reminder of why the wheel became the industry standard in the first place. And in this instance, that wheel is being used to crush a human skull until it explodes like a rotten honeydew.

3/16/2022,"Russia faced a crucial bond payment on Wednesday that could lead to the sanctions-racked country defaulting for the first time since 1998, and its first major international debt default since the Bolshevik revolution a century ago. Moscow was due to make $117m (£89.4m) interest payments, or coupons, to investors holding $2-denominated bonds. But with much of its foreign exchange reserves frozen by international sanctions, it may be unable to pay. That could pave the way to a historic default, after a 30-day grace period, that would add to the intense pressure on the Russian economy. “The onset of war, western sanctions, the exodus of international conglomerates and freefalling investor confidence have led to Russia’s downfall with its currency, financial system, and the wider economy in a state of ruin,” said Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor. “Although Russia technically has a 30-day grace period before an official default, a full-blown collapse is almost inevitable.” The Russian finance minister, Anton Siluanov, has accused the west of trying to engineer an “artificial default” by freezing access to the Bank of Russia’s foreign exchange reserves held by other major central banks. Moscow has said it could pay international bondholders in roubles, if it were unable to service its debts in the currencies they were issued in. It argued that this would mean it was meeting the payment. “Is that a default? From Russia’s point of view, we are fulfilling our obligations,” Siluanov said on state TV on Monday. Russia’s finance ministry announced earlier this week it had sent a payment order of $117.2m, but that western sanctions could be a complication, in which case it would pay in roubles. The rating agency Fitch said on Tuesday that Russia would be in default if it did not meet Wednesday’s interest payments in dollars, once the 30-day grace period had expired. “The payment in local currency of Russia’s US dollar eurobond coupons due on 16 March would, if it were to occur, constitute a sovereign default on expiry of the 30-day grace period,” Fitch said. Moscow last defaulted during the financial crisis of 1998, when it could not meet its domestic rouble debts and Soviet-era debts. However, it continued to make payments on international bonds issued after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Until now, its only comprehensive default on foreign debt was after the 1917 revolution, when the new Soviet government repudiated the debts of the Tsarist regime. Russia currently owes about $40bn in euro- and dollar-denominated sovereign debt, with $20bn held abroad. Foreign banks have about $120bn in exposure to Russia, mainly in Europe, according to data from the Bank of International Settlements. Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the IMF, has said a Russian default would not trigger a global financial crisis, as the total exposure of banks to Russia was “definitely not systemically relevant”. City experts agree the potential hit to global financial markets could be limited. “While a default would be symbolic, it seems unlikely that it will have significant ramifications, both in Russia and elsewhere,” said William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics. The value of Russia government bonds has plunged to distressed levels since the invasion of Ukraine, as investors have anticipated a default. Russian sovereign debt sold since the 2014 annexation of Crimea contains a provision for alternative currency payments if Moscow is unable to use foreign currency for “reasons beyond its control”. Those issued since 2018 included clauses allowing for rouble payments. However, the bonds in question on Wednesday are not thought to include such small print. A default could trigger Russian debt default insurance policies known as credit default swaps (CDS), taken out as protection against such an eventuality. Wednesday’s coupons are the first of several interest payment hurdles facing Russia, with another $615m due later in March.",News/World news,Russian default looms as deadline for dollar bond payments arrives,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/16/russian-default-looms-as-deadline-for-dollar-bond-payments-arrives
3/16/2022,"Australian director Jennifer Peedom had a huge hit with her 2017 documentary Mountain, descanting on the majesty of mountains. I found myself carried along by its admittedly gushy mix of great cinematography, swirling orchestral score, sonorous voiceover from Willem Dafoe and prose-poetic script by Robert Macfarlane. Peedom has now done it again, this time on the subject of rivers with the usual montage of powerful images. Visually rich though it still is, I have to admit to being a bit restless with this kind of globalist Imax-style docu-fantasia – a hangover, maybe, from the success of Terrence Malick’s The Tree of Life. The droning observations can be platitudinous and verging on insufferable. “The world’s great cities all have a river at their heart!” intones Dafoe. (Suck it up, Brussels and Milan!) This film has a story, of sorts, to tell: once we let rivers alone, worshipped them, and allowed their course to determine where human settlements appeared. Now we dam and re-route them and use them to generate clean energy, though at the cost of damaging the flood plain. As the river reaches the ocean, Dafoe wonderingly observes: “Its spirit is now lost for ever … but its death in the ocean is only the beginning of its reincarnation.” This kind of religiose incantation becomes wearing after a while, and it is exasperating when the film does not specify which rivers, in which countries, we are looking at. This becomes a particular problem when we see examples of derelict dams being dynamited, the water rushing forth and the river reborn. Which rivers are these? What specific environmental problems was the dam causing, and when did the politicians decide the energy gain wasn’t worth it? We don’t discover. But it’s still an impressive visual event for the big screen.  River is released on 18 March in cinemas.",Arts/Film,River review – spectacular montage-doc goes to work on gushing waters,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/16/river-review-jennifer-peedom-willem-dafoe
3/16/2022,"Apple’s latest tablet is an iPad Air upgraded with the M1 chip from the newest Macs and iPad Pro – turning it into a compact powerhouse that’s just as happy manipulating images in Photoshop as it is binge-watching the latest series of Star Trek: Picard. This new fifth-generation model is £10 cheaper than the outgoing model, costing £569 ($599/A$929). While certainly premium-priced, it undercuts Apple’s other M1-equipped 11in tablet, the iPad Pro, by £180. The design of the new tablet is identical to the 2020 iPad Air, which still looks top-class in 2022. It generally feels solid and well-made, though a device this thin will need to be treated with care and kept in a case for transport. Oddly two small spots next to the Apple logo on the aluminium back creaked slightly when pressed with a finger. The power button doubles as a Touch ID fingerprint scanner, which works well but isn’t quite as effortless to use as Face ID on the iPhone or iPad Pro. The iPad Air has a great 10.9in screen. It is crisp, clear and bright, but lacks the firm’s ProMotion 120Hz technology, which makes it less smooth and leaves it suffering from a bit of so-called “jelly scroll” when scrolling in landscape, similar to the iPad mini. The M1 chip and 8GB of RAM give the small tablet desktop computer-level processing power. It’ll fly through all the usual tablet tasks such as browsing, email, updating your Premier League team or watching TV. But, as with the latest iPad Pro, it also has unrivalled performance to handle complex image manipulation in Affinity Photo, the drawing and rendering of 3D worlds in SketchUp, or the creation of a cinematic masterpiece in LumaFusion. Outside of gaming, most will not need that much power on a regular basis, but having a more powerful chip hasn’t hurt battery life. The iPad Air still gets a reliable 10 hours of browsing, light app use or offline video. The iPad ships with Apple’s latest iPadOS 15.4, which introduces a major new feature called Universal Control that allows you to use a Mac’s keyboard and mouse to control the iPad or visa versa, including dragging and dropping files between the two. The long-awaited feature is quite something, extending the usefulness of the tablet as a second screen or input device, but only if you also have a modern Mac computer running macOS Monterey. The webcam has been upgraded over its predecessor with Apple’s game-changing 12-megapixel automatic panning and zooming video call camera that was introduced first to the iPad Pro, but is now available on all current iPads. Screen: 10.9in 2360x1640 Liquid Retina display (264ppi) Processor: Apple M1 RAM: 8GB Storage: 64 or 256GB Operating system: iPadOS 15.4 Camera: 12MP rear, 12MP selfie Connectivity: Wifi 6 (5G optional), Bluetooth 5, USB-C, Touch ID, Smart Connecter Dimensions: 247.6 x 178.5 x 6.1mm Weight: 461g (5G version: 462g) Apple does not provide an estimated lifespan for the iPad Air’s battery, but it can be replaced for £99. Batteries in similar devices maintain at least 80% of their original capacity for at least 500 full charge cycles. The tablet is generally repairable, with the out-of-warranty service cost being £396.44, which includes the screen. The tablet has a 100% recycled aluminium body, 100% recycled tin in the solder of its main board, 96% recycled rare earth elements, and at least 35% recycled plastic used in multiple components. Apple breaks down the tablet’s environmental impact in its report and offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. The fifth-generation Apple iPad Air costs from £569 ($599/A$929) with 64GB of storage, or £719 ($749/A$1,159) with 5G, and ships on 18 March. For comparison, the 10.2in iPad costs £319, the iPad mini costs £479 and the iPad Pro costs from £749, Amazon’s Fire HD 8 costs £90, the Fire HD 10 costs £150, and the Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 costs £649. The 2022 iPad Air is one of the best premium tablets you can buy, now with enough power to be as good at content creation as general-purpose browsing and TV-watching. The slim design and 10.9in screen strike an excellent balance between usability and portability, slotting nicely in between the small iPad mini and giant 12.9in iPad Pro. With the right accessories it can be a laptop replacement, too, or the new Universal Control feature helps it be a seamless second screen for a Mac. Centre Stage is brilliant for video calls, Touch ID works great, the speakers are really good, and you’ll get 10 hours of useful battery life out of it. You can expect at least seven years of software updates from release, meaning you can keep using it for longer than any Android competitor. Then there’s the unrivalled library of apps from desktop-class software to almost every media consumption service. As brilliant as the iPad Air is, its biggest problem is being undercut to the tune of £250 by Apple’s basic 10.2in iPad, which offers many of these benefits without as much raw performance and in a much older design. If all you want to do is watch TV on it, the basic model is the better buy. Pros: modern design, unrivalled M1 performance, good battery life, great screen, USB-C, iPadOS with long software support life, huge range of apps, great speakers, great mics, best-in-class Centre Stage video-call camera, recycled aluminium. Cons: expensive, no multi-user support, relatively small storage on the starting model with no way to add more, no Face ID, slight “jelly scroll” effect, must be treated with more care than cheaper rivals.

3/16/2022,"The four grand slam tournaments will no longer feature extended final sets in any of their competitions after it was announced on Wednesday that the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon and US Open will all enforce a 10-point tie-break once the score reaches 6-6 in the final set of any match. The new scoring rules will begin at the French Open in May having first been introduced as a trial this year. Tennis has increasingly scrutinised the length of matches in recent years, particularly after some excessively long men’s fifth sets involving big servers such as John Isner. “Further to extensive consultation with the WTA, ATP, ITF and tennis officiating community, the Grand Slam Board’s decision is based on a strong desire to create greater consistency in the rules of the game at the Grand Slams, and thus enhance the experience for the players and fans alike,” read a joint statement. In recent years, the four majors have each enforced different rules in the final set of singles matches. Since the pandemic began, however, the governing bodies have worked more closely together on certain issues, allowing them to convene and produce more consistent decisions. The decision will not be universally popular. Many classic matches have occurred over extended final sets and this ruling means that they have essentially been eradicated from the top level of the sport following changes to the Davis Cup and Billie Jean King Cup formats. Likewise, while events in the men’s tournaments have driven these changes, it is unclear what benefits this new format brings to the already shorter best-of-three sets matches that women’s players are required to compete in. Meanwhile, Novak Djokovic will be able to defend his title at Roland Garros as things stand, according to the tournament director Amelie Mauresmo. Djokovic was denied the right to enter Australia for the year’s first grand slam due to his unvaccinated status and was also ruled out of a tournament in Indian Wells for the same reason. However, France largely lifted coronavirus restrictions this week, with the exception of certain areas such as hospitals and nursing homes. Mauresmo told a press conference on Wednesday: “As things stand, nothing stands in the way of Djokovic taking part in the French Open.”",Sport/Sport,Final sets in all four grand slams to be decided by 10-point tie-break,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/16/final-sets-in-all-four-grand-slams-to-be-decided-by-10-point-tie-break-tennis
3/16/2022,"Robert Page has insisted Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey will be “fighting fit” for Wales’s World Cup play-off semi-final against Austria and is not concerned they could be undercooked, despite the pair struggling for game time at their clubs. Bale has played 77 minutes for Real Madrid since Wales’s rout of Belarus in November and Ramsey, who joined Rangers on loan from Juventus in January, has made only two starts since that international camp. Page said he was confident Bale and Ramsey would be in “peak condition” for next Thursday’s match at a sold-out Cardiff City Stadium and suggested playing for Wales helped the key duo to excel. The manager conceded their fitness could have been a problem had they been facing a possible play-off final the following Tuesday. The final will take place in June after Scotland v Ukraine was postponed.

They just keep going. “I don’t think we’ve ever had a camp where we’ve had all our players playing the weekend before. But big players turn up for big games and they’ve proven that over time.

3/16/2022,"Hundreds of seafarers on more than 100 foreign-flagged cargo vessels are stranded in Ukrainian waters in the Black Sea and Sea of Azov “in the middle of the line of fire”. The International Chamber of Shipping and unions are calling for the immediate creation of safe “blue corridors” to enable the ships and their crews to leave without risk of missile or mine strikes. The UN’s International Maritime Organization, which held an emergency meeting last week to address the situation, estimates that up to 2,000 men could be affected, although some may have been repatriated, it said. Russian’s military took control of the crucial waterway when it invaded Ukraine on 24 February. One man, Hadisur Rahman, 27, was killed at the port of Olvia, near Mykolaiv on the Dnipro-Bug estuary, earlier this month after a missile struck his Bangladesh-flagged cargo ship. The same night, six crew had to be rescued from the icy waters after an Estonian cargo vessel, the Helt, sank after an explosion near Odesa. A further three vessels have been hit by projectiles since the invasion began. Rahman, a “very promising” officer who was the sole breadwinner for his family, died on the bridge of the Banglar Samriddhi when the missile struck on 2 March. Anam Chowdhury, president of the Bangladesh Merchant Mariners Officers’ Association, said: “It has taken the whole country by shock. We have never had a situation like this. Hadisur was a dynamic engineer.” He added that the third engineer’s funeral was held on Wednesday in his village of Hasnabad Betagi in Bangladesh. “Thousands of people attended his funeral,” said Chowdhury. “He was very promising; he would have gone on to be a chief engineer. He was the eldest son in the family; he was going to get married and build a house for his parents.” After the missile strike, Ukraine accused the Russian military of targeting the port, while Russia’s embassy in Dhaka said the circumstances of the incident were “being established”, Reuters reported. Russia denies targeting civilians. Natalie Shaw, of the International Chamber of Shipping, said between 90 and 140 ships were stranded in the Black Sea region, typically with a crew of 16 to 24. “We’re told the Russians have said they will fire on any vessels that move in the area,” said Shaw. “We are worried as things intensify.” Shaw said countries including Bangladesh, the Philippines and India were asking for their seafarers to be repatriated. “The problem is, it may not be safe to get them off the vessels into other countries. People are being attacked in humanitarian corridors. It could be taking them out of the frying pan into the fire. “It may not be intentional to hit the ships,” she added, “but unfortunately, they are sitting in the middle of the line of fire and they are collateral damage.” Nataliya Yefrimenko, an inspector at the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF), said the initial hits happened to ships at anchorage. “For the ships, it is safer to be in port than at anchorage. Now, we have no ships at anchorage. The safety of the crew is the shipowners’ responsibility, whether it is safer to stay or to go. So far, it is unsafe for ships to leave, unless there is a safe corridor.” Last week, the IMO’s secretary general, Kitack Lim, indicated “his commitment to take immediate action” towards establishing a safe maritime corridor with “the cooperation and collaboration of the relevant parties, including littoral states”. This would allow the “evacuation of seafarers and ships” from the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to a safer place. Capt Kuba Szymanski, secretary general of InterManager, which represents the managers of about 5,000 ships and 250,000 seafarers, said they had evacuated four ships in Black Sea ports and were providing funds for the families of Ukrainian seafarers to help get them into safe countries, including Romania, Poland and Moldova. “The ships are locked in those ports because the waters around there are mined. It’s not safe to give orders to move away. When we think that the safety of the crew cannot be assured, we are evacuating crew but as far as I’m concerned that was only required in four cases. “Last week, IMO agreed, we will be seeking blue corridors. Now we need to see how we can walk this talk, and allow ships to sail away.” Rostyslav Inzhestoikov, the assistant chaplain in Odesa of Stella Maris, a charity for seafarers, said: “Some of the crews have been evacuated, some remain onboard, continuing to maintain the ship. “Can you imagine, they are blocked in a country where there is war, outside the UN, close to bombing. If they read the news, they know one ship has sunk and a Bangladeshi has been killed. It is normal to be afraid. It is high stress for everyone in Ukraine.”",News/Environment,Calls for ‘blue corridor’ to let stranded seafarers leave Ukraine war zone ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/16/ukraine-russia-war-black-sea-azov-blue-corridor-stranded-seafarers
3/16/2022,"The revelation that a black schoolgirl was strip-searched by police at school in Hackney, east London, after teachers claimed that they smelt marijuana on her, is shocking. But the details of the search, the indignities inflicted on a 15-year-old girl, are truly distasteful. She was made to strip naked, to spread her legs, to use her hands to spread her buttock cheeks and then to cough. She was menstruating. According to family members, the police insisted that she take off the bloody pad and would not let her go to the toilet to clean up. Then they made her reuse the same pad. No drugs were found, yet the rumour spread around the school that this perfectly innocent girl was a drug dealer. Her mother told the local child safeguarding review that the experience had left her daughter traumatised. Her aunt added: “I see the change from a happy-go-lucky girl to a timid recluse that hardly speaks to me.” She said the girl was now in therapy and that she self-harms. It would be easy to dismiss the 2020 incident as an aberration, to believe that the police officers involved were the proverbial “bad apples”. After the damning review, the Met has voiced public contrition, calling the strip search “truly regrettable” and apologising “to the child concerned, her family and the wider community.” But there is a deeper truth here: although senior Metropolitan police officers are better media trained than ever, the racism and misogyny that has always characterised and blighted the force is still very much present. Recent incidents make that clear. Start with the Independent Office for Police Conduct report on behaviour at Charing Cross police station that found a culture of toxic masculinity. Think then of the Met, again in Hackney, having to apologise and pay compensation to a completely innocent woman, Dr Konstancja Duff, for the use of “sexist, derogatory and unacceptable language” when she was arrested and strip-searched in 2013. She was only trying to help a 15-year-old black boy who the police were stopping and searching by giving him a know-your-rights card. Duff described what happened next: “I was pinned to the floor of a cell by three female officers. I had my hands cuffed behind my back and my legs tied together while they cut off my clothes with scissors. They ripped out my earrings, grabbed my breasts roughly while turning me over, and even touched me between my legs, apparently looking for genital piercings.” It took Duff nine years to get an apology arising from the encounter. How many other women, black and white, are abused in this way and give up before getting justice? People are all too aware of the tragedy of Sarah Everard, the young woman kidnapped on a London street, and raped and murdered by a serving police officer. Then there is the case of Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman, two young black sisters from north London who went missing in June 2020. Their bodies were eventually found by family members in a nearby park after police seemed to show little interest in investigating. After the murders and a trial, two police officers were subsequently jailed for photographing the women’s bodies at the murder scene and sharing the photos on WhatsApp, including one group of 41 police officers. A recent interview with Hampshire deputy chief constable, Maggie Blyth, who is now the national lead for violence against women and girls for the National Police Chiefs’ Council, is revealing in this context. She said the concept of a “few bad apples” is wrong and that policing, like other jobs with access to power, could attract people who wanted to “use their power in a corrupt and criminal way.” She added: “There will be some attracted into working in policing because of the powers that it offers them, the powers to exert and coerce other people, particularly vulnerable individuals. I think we shouldn’t be naive to that.” Obviously, not every police officer abuses their power, but too many do. And racial discrimination in the way the police exercise their power has been a statistically verifiable fact for far too long. The use of stop and search continues to increase: by some estimates, black people are nine times more likely to be victims. How many of those are children? Look to Hackney again. According to the child safeguarding review, in 2020/21 in the central east basic command unit of the Met (which covers Hackney), 25 children under the age of 18 were strip-searched (or “further searched”) to use Met police terminology). Most of the searches (88%) were negative. And only two of the children searched were white. The Hackney schoolgirl was failed in so many ways. The police abused her and no teacher thought to contact her parents, to ask the girl afterwards how she was: certainly they don’t seem to have grasped the gravity of this awful situation. That’s dispiriting in itself, but the most dispiriting thing about all of this is that, after decades of marching, demonstrating, campaigning, police practice is as bad as ever – and now the government is changing the law to make it even harder to march and campaign, to highlight these injustices. The conclusion to be drawn is stark: black schoolgirls are not safe from police abuse, even at school, supposedly a place of safety. What kind of society tolerates this?
