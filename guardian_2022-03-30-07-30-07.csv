3/30/2022,"Whether lighting is a deterrent to burglars or simply helps them see what they are doing has been a matter of hot debate. Now research suggests that when it comes to reducing theft from cars, it might be best to leave criminals in the dark. Researchers found the level of night-time thefts from cars almost halved when street lighting was turned off between midnight and 5am, compared with staying on all night. The authors suggest possible reasons for the results include that it is harder for offenders to see valuables inside a car without lighting, or assess a vehicle’s security, while it is also more difficult to remove items such as hub caps without adequate light. “It is to do with opportunist theft,” said Dr Phil Edwards of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who led the project. “Without lighting it’s harder to see the laptop left overnight by accident on the passenger seat, for example.” The study, which is published in the Journal of Quantitative Criminology, reveals how the team looked at data for various forms of crime, including violence, burglary and theft from vehicles, as changes were made to street lighting between April 2004 and September 2013 in Oxfordshire, Reading, West Berkshire and, until July 2013, in Wokingham. Three types of changes to street lighting, from it being on all night, were examined: illumination being switched off between about midnight and about 5am, using white all-night illumination, and the dimming of lighting in the small hours. The team found all forms of crime analysed were more common at night than during the day, but all declined over the years studied. Perhaps counterintuitively, the study found that switching off the lights could bring benefits. When street lighting was turned off between about midnight and about 5am, the rate of total night-time crime fell by around a quarter, while thefts from vehicles fell by 44% – once changes in daytime levels of crimes, which gives a sense of crime fluctuations due to factors other than lighting changes, were taken into account. However the team found this change in lighting was linked to a similar sized rise in theft from vehicles in adjacent streets, which were lit throughout the night, suggesting the change may simply have displaced the problem to neighbouring roads. Despite that, the team suggest that switching the lights off in the small hours might bring overall benefits, noting that when crimes committed at any time of the day were included, the move “was associated with a reduction in overall crime, burglary, and violence on both the focal streets and those adjacent”. Edwards said the new work shows the complexities of decisions around whether and how to light the streets. “It is clear from other studies that people like street lighting, it makes them feel safer,” he said. “But studies like ours are showing that actually the effects of street lighting aren’t that clear.”",News/Society,"Street lighting increases theft from cars, rather than deterring opportunists",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/29/street-lighting-increases-theft-from-cars-rather-than-deterring-thieves
3/30/2022,"This was a useful England friendly. Depleted by mid-season twangs, degraded by a frustrating red card for Serge Aurier – who’s still got it – and limited as a contest by the poverty of this Ivory Coast team; but there was good stuff here too, and a sense of two vital cogs in the Southgate universe clunking into place. One thing does seem certain after another controlled Wembley win. This is how it’s going to go down. The shape, the pegs, the architecture of this team is set. We’re going to play this out to the end. It was a good game for Jude Bellingham, who was imperiously good at times, and might just have a chance of opening up that central midfield. And beyond that for two of the comfy chairs, the inherited mahogany sideboards, the tried and trusted internal fittings of this England team. Harry Maguire was booed by England’s fans at the start. But he was steady, unobtrusive and very much the England version of himself. Raheem Sterling got the same treatment, more viciously, in the pre-Southgate years. Here he produced an eye-catching performance, restating, in timely fashion, his own credentials as the most decisive English attacking midfielder since, well, who? David Beckham? Gazza? David Platt? Beckham ended up with 42 assists for England, which is spectacular. But tot up the stats and Sterling has pretty much everyone else covered. He showed us why here. Half an hour into a fun, skittish, open game England’s No 7 took the ball on the left inside the Ivory Coast penalty area. Faced by two crouched and coiled defenders, Sterling produced a lovely little miniature. It will be one of the ticks, the asterisks, the bold-underlines Gareth Southgate takes from this March double header. Here was a very basic reminder of the way England have won in the age of Gareth. Sterling used to take a lot of criticism. It is more nuanced now: his numbers are too good, his longevity unignorable. Instead the reservations are more to do with points of style, levels, ultimacy. Those who wish to criticise focus on the times when his basic technique can’t keep pace with genuinely A-list movement and a fine nose for space. This is how Sterling plays. Here is a footballer who never stops, who keeps on coming, who gets knocked down, but always gets up again. And for England Sterling is a lock. The last six years have brought a gushing tap of attacking talent, a series of crowd favourites and coming men. But here was evidence, like it or not, that Kane-Sterling, Sterling-Kane, is up there with England’s greatest ever attacking partnerships. And they’re not done yet. Southgate had picked a light, jazzy, pop-up team, set up in a 4-3-3. They probed in a meandering kind of way for the opening half hour. There were shrill cries every time Jack Grealish got the ball. It felt a little vague, fun, lightweight. And then Sterling did that brilliant thing. The move was started by Maguire, who stepped out of defence smoothly and funnelled the ball to the left, where it ended up at Sterling’s feet. The Ivory Coast defence looked set, too close for a cross. Sterling had come to a halt. At which point he did something very difficult, beating Aurier (yes, OK) from a standing start, with a jink and a shift of feet and a lucky break of the ball, dribbling skills applied exactly where they can make a difference. Sterling had made space for a cross now, but that also had to beat a man, a nutmeg assist in the tightest of spaces that found Ollie Watkins in the right spot to score. It was a wonderful assist, a genuine piece of goal-making drawing on the full palette of skills: the jink, the pass, the picture of those around him. And yes, it was against Ivory Coast, but it keeps on being against someone, every time. When Sterling scored England’s second just before half time, prodding the ball home after Grealish had found him with a nice pass, it was his 17th goal to go with 13 assists in his last 29 England games. This is how teams win games. If these March dates have done anything it is to confirm this is still how Southgate will set up his tournament team eight months from now: solidity; more solidity; Kane, Sterling. The idea is still out there that some more compelling version is hiding behind the relentless consistency of the best England team in a couple of generations. The cries of frustration will still be heard, based in the notion that were England to play to their attacking strengths instead of trying to control the game, to smear their face with woad, batter their chest and say, behold the attacking power of this fully operational England, then the world would be brought to heel. This is, of course, misjudged, based in vaguely grasped sporting exceptionalism, the idea that once the English unleash their inner Albion none can resist. France don’t play like that, and their attacking players are better. Balance is everything. Qatar is already flickering on the desert horizon. For better or worse, this thing, this England iteration, is going to play right out to the end.",Sport/Football,Raheem Sterling shows his value to Southgate’s tried and trusted England | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/29/raheem-sterling-shows-his-value-to-southgates-tried-and-trusted-england

Sumptuous passing range. 7 Jude Bellingham Staked a serious claim with vision and penetration on the ball, along with clever pressing off it. Hit post after slick move. Player of the match. 8 Raheem Sterling Trickery and tenacity laid goal on plate for Watkins; scored himself in aftermath of his own excellent run and shot. Fine display. 8 Ollie Watkins Willing and inventive runner up front who showed predatory instincts to open the scoring from Sterling’s centre. 7 Jack Grealish At the heart of some intricate, purposeful England moves. Teed up Bellingham chance and smart first-time assist for Sterling. 7 Substitutes Kyle Walker-Peters (for White, 45) Lost his man when Deli missed Ivory Coast’s only chance. 5 Luke Shaw (for Mitchell, 62) Tidy enough but cheap free-kick could have cost goal. 6 Emile Smith Rowe (for Grealish, 62) Missed late chance in rare moment of excitement after break. 6 Harry Kane (for Watkins, 62) Tiniest late glimpse of a 50th goal eluded him. 6 Phil Foden (for Sterling, 62) A couple of delightful touches and a searching corner for Mings goal. 7 Conor Gallagher (for Ward-Prowse, 80) Glimmers of energy but little time to make impact. 6",Sport/Football,England 3-0 Ivory Coast: player ratings from Wembley friendly,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/29/england-ivory-coast-player-ratings-wembley-friendly
