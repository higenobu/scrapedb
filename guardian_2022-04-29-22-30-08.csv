4/29/2022,"Jürgen Klopp believes he has only started creating a legacy at Liverpool and his new contract offers certainty to any player considering their future at “the perfect place”. The Liverpool manager extended his Anfield career until 2026 on Thursday and has urged his quadruple-chasing team to “squeeze everything out of the season” with five matches remaining in the Premier League title race, an FA Cup final and a possible third Champions League final appearance in five campaigns to come. Irrespective of how the season ends, however, Klopp insists the next four years can yield even greater rewards for Liverpool than he has accomplished thus far. “I really think it’s a good place to be or a good place to join, if not the perfect place,” he said of his decision to extend. “The world is in a difficult situation; it’s not only coronavirus, it’s Ukraine, it’s so many things, and then on a less important level big clubs have problems here and there with money and these kind of things. “We want to offer emotion, we want to deliver excitement, we want to be together with our people, we want to really be connected and we want to be special as well as a club. We sit here now and in 20 years’ time we will look back and for all of us it’s about creating stories which we will remember easily and think: ‘Wow, that was good.’ “But we have to do that now – we cannot wait 10 years. I’ve already been here for a while, and this isn’t a contract where you have a look and go: ‘This is really nice, let’s stay here for ever because the people like us.’ Internally with the coaching staff, it’s really like this [that we have to achieve now]. It’s no threat. This is only the start. That’s the plan, that we really, really go for it. There are no guarantees in our sport, and that’s why we have to enjoy the journey.” Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mané and Roberto Firmino are out of contract in 2023 and, despite protracted negotiations, Liverpool have been unable to agree an extension with the Egypt international. With his side preparing to visit Newcastle on Saturday lunchtime, Klopp was asked whether his new contract would persuade others to follow suit, and replied: “That is more a question for the boys, but my relationship with them is great … I think everything is clear in this moment. If that is a positive sign for the boys, great, but I don’t think this will be the one decisive thing for whatever decision they want to make. It is their own life but we just wanted to guarantee that everyone who wants to be here knows what he can expect.”",Sport/Football,Jürgen Klopp declares Liverpool ‘perfect place’ for players to play,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/29/jurgen-klopp-declares-liverpool-perfect-place-players
4/29/2022,"My partner and I recently became first-time parents. We are lucky to have both sets of grandparents to give hands-on support. This was particularly great when our baby was very young and everything felt like one big blur. However, we’ve begun to find my mother’s presence increasingly taxing – yet feel guilty as we are also grateful for the support. Every time she is around she undermines our parenting by questioning or commenting on the way we do things. She does it in a playful manner which makes it difficult to object to, but she has also become anxious about the baby’s safety, often catastrophising. We initially ignored it, then tried to justify what we do with research. This became tiring, so we now just roll our eyes. By the time she has left, we feel worn down – as if parenting a baby wasn’t hard enough! I have tried raising this with her, and she was apologetic but then instantly commented on the baby’s bedtime routine. I’ve planned to have another conversation with her but I worry about hurting her feelings. Still, it’s got to the point that having her around is more emotionally taxing than helpful. The baby is the main focus of her life as she doesn’t have many other hobbies/interests/social engagements – and we don’t want to deny her time with her grandchild. But sometimes I want to tell her to leave us alone! Any advice on how to approach this with my mother? Gratitude and guilt can tether us to some unhealthy behaviours. That said, I also feel for your mum in this: it sounds like she was really useful at the beginning but is now more of an irritation. That may be confusing for her.When a baby is born, especially if it’s the first in the family, everything shifts – and not just for the new parents. People’s status changes from parent to grandparent can stir up a lot of buried emotions; often this has very little to do with the actual baby. What sort of mother was your mother? Does she see this as her chance to do things differently? Does she see her value in what she can do for people, and being needed? Perversely, it may feel to her that you no longer need her now that you are a parent yourself. What’s your dad’s perspective? Everyone offers advice with a new baby – and it can be maddening – but it’s their way of being involved. I found the best thing to do is be curious, then ignore what’s not needed. Avoid getting into quoting research: it can sound like you’re saying they did it wrong. Family psychotherapist Nicola McCarry wondered if “taking care of your mum’s feelings” has been a pattern growing up, and maybe this is why you’re thinking so much about them. She also pointed out that as you’ve already tried to raise this with your mum, you may need to set some boundaries. You need to decide where to draw the line. Try to work out exactly why you find this situation is so upsetting, and what emotions it’s bringing up. When you’re ready to talk, McCarry recommends “preparing yourself so your tone is how you’d like it to be – maybe even put together a script so your thoughts are ordered and organised. And remember that when we get anxious, we [tend to] fight, flight, appease, so it’s not the best time to have a conversation.” She suggested also asking your mum: “I’ve noticed you feel anxious, how are you coping, what’s going on?” New babies mean new bonds are formed but it can also be a time of old hurts coming up. But also remember that things change quickly at this stage of new parenthood. So how it is now is not how it will be in a year, or even a few months.

4/29/2022,"With prices soaring across the board, last month’s news that Tesco has launched a range of wines at under £5 might seem welcome – but how good a wine can you really get for that kind of money? The answer, I found, is not that great. After all, once you’ve factored in duty, tax, bottling, packaging and all other costs, there’s only about 20p of wine in a bottle costing less than £4, say. While none of them was actively undrinkable, there wasn’t much wine character in the two Casa Maña wines I tried (a red tempranillo and a rosé), made, incidentally, by Felix Solis, the outfit that produces Tesco’s own-label alcohol-free wines. Several of the wines were bought in bulk, which from an environmental point of view is no bad thing, but rarely indicates high quality. The Lateral Cabernet Sauvignon 2021 (£3.89, 12.5%) from Chile was at least pleasantly blackcurranty, if untypically light for Chile; and if you’re a malbec fan, you might find the Firemark Malbec 2021 (£4.49, 13%) OK. (It does seem strange, though, that the back label recommends that it’s “great with juicy steaks and firepit-style BBQs” – if you could afford either of those, I’d have thought you could probably run to a better bottle of wine.) Oddly, it was the pinot grigio from Caparelli (see today’s pick) that turned out to be the best of the bunch: it’s an easygoing wine to swig with a selection of antipasti or a carbonara. It’s also curious to see Tesco pushing wine at such prices just as the so-called discounters such as Aldi and Lidl are going upmarket – Aldi, for example, now has a Chinese cabernet sauvignon and a Greek pinot noir for £14.99, and a chateauneuf-du-pape and an amarone for £19.99. People apparently trust the store to deliver on these more expensive bottles, but if you’re spending that much, why not support an indie instead? Asda also has some good deals. At £7, its Marques del Norte vintage cava (see today’s picks) is astonishingly good value, even if the term vintage is a touch misleading. It’s only from 2020, but that gives it an attractive freshness that would work well with any seafood. For the same price, you can get Bruce Jack’s ballsy pinotage malbec, which is a much better buy than the Tesco’s Firemark. Finally, and slightly more expensive but really good value for an interesting wine, try the new Alicante Bouschet from Marks & Spencer’s excellent “Found” range. True, it’s twice the price of the Lateral cabernet, but it’s easily three times as good. Caparelli Pinot Grigio delle Venezie 2021 £4.50 Tesco, 12%. Fresh, clean and citrussy. Better than a lot of cheap pinot grigio out there, and perfectly decent. Marques del Norte Cava Brut 2020 £7 Asda, 11.5%. Pleasantly light and creamy. Perfect for fish and chips or a selection of tapas. Bruce Jack Pinotage Malbec 2020 £7 Asda, Sainsbury’s, 14.5%. A hearty South African red – ideal for a barbecue. M&S Found Alicante Bouschet 2021 £8 Marks & Spencer, 14%. Vivid, fruity red that tastes of dark cherries. Would be great with duck.

4/29/2022,"Marilyn Monroe once said clothes should be tight enough to show you are a woman but loose enough to show you are a lady. I know this sounds borderline problematic in 2022 but I don’t have time get into that here – and anyway, please don’t even think about trying to cancel Marilyn, kiddos, because for those of us who remember the 20th century, that is a red line. The point is, she was right – at least when it comes to jeans. Just because it is time to leave the spray-on skinnies behind (and it is), you don’t have to embrace exaggerated wide-legged denim. Do you want to look like Justin Bieber? I didn’t think so. You want to look like Marilyn in The Misfits. (Google it and you’ll see what I mean.)Jeans are the most useful item in a British summer. It is lovely to imagine a summer wardrobe of gauzy shirts and sundresses the size of hankies, but it’s also pointless. That wardrobe isn’t for summer; it’s for one or two brief spells of heatwave bliss. Your actual summer wardrobe – the clothes you will be mostly wearing between May and when Strictly starts – is a different kettle of fish. There are winter clothes, and summer clothes, and then there are jeans. One of their superpowers – as well as never really looking dirty and having plenty of pockets – is that they work for almost any temperature – if they are the right jeans. This is most important now for two reasons: if you wear jeans with a plain white T-shirt, the denim has more heavy lifting to do, style-wise, than with a statement knit and big coat; and skinny jeans will make you sticky and uncomfortable on warm days, while a looser pair would be much cooler. In both senses. Jeans used to be all about how they made your bum look. But to get jeans right now you need to focus on how they look at the waist and leg. The top button should sit on your natural waist and fasten snugly, so you can tuck (or French tuck) a top into the front of the waistband and have a defined silhouette without wearing a belt. But the jeans should “release from the thigh and knee”, which is fashion speak for being a bit loose almost all the way down. The ankle can taper for a more feminine silhouette – a balloon shape – or be straight-legged, which looks more menswear-ish. It’s really not that complicated.Specialist jeans boutiques make it feel complicated. Jeans are folded into rectangles on shelves, which looks neat and minimalist but makes it impossible to see, without messing up the display and antagonising the staff, what shape they are or whether they might vaguely fit. There are grandiose explanations about selvedge and heritage. (Guys, you sell trousers. You’re not the British Museum.) Vintage is a brilliant way to shop for jeans. If you spy a rail of old Levi’s in a thrift store (Beyond Retro is a treasure trove), look for the blue-sky washes of 1980s and 1990s denim, the sweet spot between flares and skinnies. There are also great brands on the high street now. Good American is becoming many women’s favourite brand – its Classic Jeans are £150 at John Lewis, in sizes 2-24. To go a tiny bit Bieber in a wearable wide-legged jean, Nobody’s Child’s High-Waisted Wide-Leg are £55 at Marks & Spencer.

4/29/2022,"Moths have declined faster in British woods over the last half-century than on farmland or in cities, despite woodlands having increased and moths being shielded from chemical and light pollution by the trees. Forest populations of moths halved between 1968 and 2016 compared with average national losses of a third, according to a study. Moths are a well-studied indicator of wider insect declines that recent research has often linked to pesticide use by industrial farming, habitat loss and urban light pollution – none of which directly affect woodlands. Species experiencing particularly drastic declines include the brindled beauty (-78%), the canary-shouldered thorn (-68%) and the scalloped oak (-69%). The loss of moths from woodland could be partly because of climate change or less woodland management such as coppicing, leading to more shading or increased deer density causing more intensive grazing. However, the team of scientists found moths whose caterpillars fed on shade-intolerant plants or shrubs and woodland flowers grazed by deer did not decline any more than species relying on unaffected grasses, trees and lichens. Dr Dan Blumgart, from Rothamsted Research and lead author of the study in Insect Conservation and Diversity, said: “Climate change is known to have contributed to the national decline in moths and it is likely that this has driven at least part of the decline observed in woodlands. “But this can’t explain why the declines have been worse in broadleaf woodland compared to other habitats. We might expect the shade provided by woodlands to help buffer against the effects of climate change but that is clearly not the case.” Based on data from the Rothamsted Insect Survey, which has counted more than 8 million individual moths from more than 400 larger species since 1968, the researchers examined four indicators of moth population health in woodland and six other habitats over the period 1968-2016. Broadleaf woodland was the only habitat in which all four measures declined severely with abundance down 51%, biomass down 52%, species richness down 14% and species diversity down 15%, compared with smaller nationwide declines in abundance (34%) and biomass (39%) with richness unchanged and diversity increasing by 10%. The woodland declines are particularly striking because they are so recent with further analysis revealing that the abundance in broadleaf woodland was stable up to the late-1980s, after which it plummeted. There were greater losses from woodlands in the south of Britain than the north which matches the general pattern of moth decline. A similar decline in woodland moths has been observed in Germany but not in a Hungarian study. According to Blumgart, other possible causes of woodland moth decline could include the spread of invasive shrubs such as rhododendron or laurel and habitat fragmentation, with woodland moths still affected by agricultural intensification beyond the woods. He said: “Although the amount of woodland in the UK hasn’t declined since the 1960s there might be more fragmentation due to the loss of hedgerows and trees outside woodlands so that could be something for future studies to look at.”",News/Environment,Moths declining faster in British woods than farmland or cities,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/29/moths-declining-faster-in-british-woods-than-farmland-or-cities
4/29/2022,"Layers of yellowed varnish have been painstakingly removed from a John Constable painting of Waterloo Bridge to reveal new detail of the early 19th-century Thames skyline and a bright blue sky. The painting – the largest created by Constable – had been dramatically transformed by the conservation treatment, said Sarah Maisey, a senior remedial conservator for paintings at the National Trust, which undertook the work. Experts spent more than 270 hours removing several layers of badly yellowed varnish that had obscured and dulled the detail of The Embarkation of George IV from Whitehall: The Opening of Waterloo Bridge, 1817. “There had been some earlier tests which showed that this painting would respond really well to varnish removal, but it has been a particular delight to see the quality of the improvement,” said Maisey. “There were challenges. It had been painted and varnished at different stages, so care had to be taken to ensure that the solvents being used to thin and remove the varnish layers didn’t also affect the paint layer. We are delighted with the final result.” Constable, who mostly painted pastoral scenes, is believed to have been influenced by Canaletto’s depictions of water pageants in Venice. The painting shows the royal barge and other vessels on the Thames about to set off for the opening of Waterloo Bridge, which is in the background. Constable is thought to have been present when the bridge was opened by the prince regent, later King George IV, on 18 June 1817. In 1942, it was replaced by a modern concrete structure. During the Victorian era, the view that Constable painted was transformed, but St Paul’s Cathedral – seen in the distance behind the bridge – has remained visible for the past two centuries. John Chu, a senior curator of paintings and sculpture at the National Trust, said: “Constable’s painting of Waterloo Bridge, full of the pageantry and colour of urban life, is a significant contrast to the quiet country scenes he is more famous for, such as The Hay Wain. “This large-scale depiction of modern events and the London metropolis was a big departure at this point in his career.” The painting was never exhibited in Constable’s lifetime, remaining in the artist’s studio until his death in 1837. It passed through several hands before reaching its current home, Anglesey Abbey in Cambridgeshire. After the conservation work, the painting has been returned to hang in the abbey’s library, where the panels and shelves are made from timber salvaged from the piles of the first bridge when it was dismantled in 1936.",Arts/Art and design,Constable painting of Waterloo Bridge ‘transformed’ by conservation work,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/29/john-constable-painting-waterloo-bridge-conservation-national-trust
4/29/2022,"German authorities have raided Deutsche Bank’s headquarters in Frankfurt over suspected money laundering at the country’s largest lender. Officers from the financial regulator BaFin, the federal police, and the Frankfurt public prosecutor’s office launched a raid on the bank’s glass-panelled offices – known locally as the “twin towers” – on Friday morning after securing a search warrant from the local court. Deutsche Bank said the issue had been self-reported and it was “fully cooperating” with police and prosecutors who launched the raid on its offices at 10am. “This is an investigative measure by the Frankfurt public prosecutor’s office in connection with suspicious activity reports [SARs] filed by the bank,” the lender said in a statement. “Deutsche Bank is fully cooperating with the authorities.” Banks and other financial institutions file SARs with law enforcement bodies when they suspect a client may be using their services for potential criminal activity. However, SARs do not mean a client is guilty of wrongdoing or require a bank to cease doing business with the client. A spokesperson for Frankfurt’s public prosector said they could not provide any further information while the investigation was ongoing. Deutsche Bank shares fell nearly 2.6% following the news. Deustche Bank is Germany’s largest lender and employs nearly 3,000 staff at its headquarters in Frankfurt. The Deutsche Bank offices were also subject to a two-day raid by 170 police in 2018, with staff later accused of helping wealthy clients evade tax. Prosecutors later dropped its investigation into two employees but fined the lender over shortfalls in its compliance procedures. Deutsche Bank has struggled to repair its reputation after a number of scandals and affiliations with controversial clients including the former US president Donald Trump. The lender was fined $630m (£501m) in 2017 after US and UK authorities accused the bank of failing to spot fraudulent trades worth up to $10bn that allowed money to be laundered out of Russia. Two years earlier, it was fined $2.5bn by the same authorities for its role in rigging the Libor interest rate between 2003 and 2007. It was also fined €13.5m (£11.3m) by Frankfurt prosecutors in 2020 for failing to submit a suspicious report over transactions processed on behalf of Danske Bank’s Estonian branch in a timely manner.",News/Business,Deutsche Bank HQ in Frankfurt raided over suspected money laundering,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/29/deutsche-bank-hq-frankfurt-raided-suspected-money-laundering

And what might we learn?Director Oscar Toeman keeps the tone so light in the opening scenes that, much like the boys and their schoolmaster, you won’t realise this is a tragedy until much too late. Dressed in uniforms as crisp as their accents, three of the youngest students talk eagerly about representing their school and country. Lyons is excited about cake. Eaton is excited about everything. And Harrison has a fact, a motto and song for just about every scenario. Played respectively by Matthew Tennyson, Vinnie Heaven and Hubert Burton, they pull on our sympathies without ever tipping over into sentimentality. The students are brave but vulnerable, likable but not always nice. With chests puffed out, they talk about breathing in great gulps of “foreign air” with a mixture of arrogance and naivety that makes us wincingly love the boys they are, but fear for the men they might become. When the three talk about their elders, particularly their schoolmaster, their faces glow with admiration. Perhaps even love. They talk with relish about the Great War yet all but ignore the war that lies ahead, despite the swastikas that line the streets. They long to be taken by the hand – to be led rather than lead – no matter where those steps might take them. There’s a lot bubbling away here and sometimes it’s hard to make out the wood from the trees. The snippets of tourist information about the Black Forest, complete with a metaphorically inclined tour guide who pops up near the end, don’t quite fit and the frequent leaps in time and perspective sometimes feel a bit tricksy.

4/29/2022,"Rebekah Vardy has suggested her agent may have leaked stories about Coleen Rooney to the Sun, in a last-minute change of approach on the eve of the looming “Wagatha Christie” libel trial. The two women are locked in an expensive and increasingly messy libel battle over accusations Vardy passed information from Rooney’s private Instagram account to the tabloid. Until now Vardy has said she was not responsible for leaking the material and did not know who did. With a week to go until the trial she says she has realised Caroline Watt, her agent and close friend, may in fact have handed over information on Rooney to Sun journalists. In an updated witness statement Vardy said: “I have to accept that it is possible that she [the agent] may have had some form of involvement that I don’t know about. I still find it hard to believe, given all her denials and her support to me during the case, but I can’t understand why the journalists would indicate otherwise.” Vardy said: “I find it very hard to accept that Caroline would deceive me in this way. I do not know what to think … I am devastated by all this. Not only have I been libelled by Coleen but I have had to face allegations that my close friend has been involved with this, and she is in such a fragile state that I can’t even address it with her properly.” Vardy has told the high court she “did not authorise or condone” her agent to leak the stories, essentially shifting the blame on to her business partner and close friend. The court previously heard how the pair discussed accessing Rooney’s Instagram account and talked about selling different stories on the Chelsea footballer Danny Drinkwater to journalists at the Sun. Rooney’s legal team have struggled to obtain some potentially crucial messages from Vardy and Watt, after a series of accidents that have affected the duo’s electronic devices, the court has been told. Watt accidentally dropped her mobile phone in the North Sea shortly after Rooney’s lawyers requested to search it for messages, the court has heard. Vardy employed an IT expert to back up her WhatsApp messages but the expert lost the password, and a laptop used by Vardy during the period in question has stopped working. Rooney’s lawyers also say electronic records suggest there was manual deletion of some WhatsApp messages sent between Vardy and Watt. Vardy’s lawyers told the court she had “not destroyed or deliberately lost any documents relevant to this litigation”, which would be a potentially serious legal issue. In a last-ditch attempt for information, Rooney’s lawyers are trying to obtain copies of any conversations that may have taken place between the two women and the Sun journalist Andy Halls. They want the court to require the reporter to hand over his WhatsApp in order to avoid a “seriously unfair trial which is contrary to the interests of justice”, arguing that Halls may have the only existing proof that Vardy or Watt leaked stories to him. In response, the Sun’s lawyers are refusing to disclose information on the basis their journalists will not betray their sources. Rooney’s team are trying to convince a high court judge that gossip stories about Wayne Rooney’s basement flooding are not worthy of the same journalistic protections afforded to more serious investigations. The case is scheduled to go to trial at the high court on 9 May. Rooney, the wife of Derby County manager Wayne, ran an elaborate sting operation that led her to claim, in late 2019, that Vardy, the wife of Leicester City’s Jamie, was the person leaking stories to the Sun. Vardy says this is a lie and has sued Rooney for libel. An early ruling in a pre-trial hearing means that Rooney is required to prove that it was Vardy who personally leaked fake stories from a private Instagram to the journalists at the Sun, rather than simply someone with access to Vardy’s Instagram account. Despite the legal process lasting almost three years, Vardy told the court that she has only just realised that her agent could have been leaking stories. Watt was due to give evidence at the trial but now says she is too ill to do so. Rooney’s lawyers reject this account of the events. They told the court Vardy had been “complicit in the sharing of private information with Ms Watt; complicit in it being passed on to the Sun and the press; and complicit in covering up her and Ms Watt’s involvement”.",News/UK news,Rebekah Vardy suggests her agent leaked Coleen Rooney stories to Sun,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/29/rebekah-vardy-coleen-rooney-sun-stories-instagram
4/29/2022,"Across much of the world people are taking international holidays, returning to the office, and going to festivals and political rallies. Faced with the seemingly unstoppable Omicron variant, they’ve decided to live as close to normality as they can in the presence of Covid-19, limiting its impact. But in Covid-zero China it’s a vastly different story. An estimated 340 million people in at least 46 cities are under some form of lockdown or restrictions in China, as cases appear in multiple provinces – often in so far tiny quantities. On Thursday Guangzhou authorities grounded hundreds of flights after the detection of a suspected case. In Hangzhou all residents have been told to test every 48 hours if they want to travel around the city. In Shanghai some residents are hanging out their windows banging pots and pans in nightly protest at a weeks-long lockdown beset by food shortages. A loudspeaker driven through the streets tells them their protest has been “incited by foreign forces”, while flying drones urge they “control your soul’s desire for freedom”. In the capital, Beijingers are stocking up on food in case of a Shanghai-style lockdown as dozens of new cases are recorded each day, prompting lockdowns of residential buildings, the closure of schools and suspension of weddings, funerals and banquets. On the official evening news broadcast, little of this makes the cut. Instead the story is of successes in the battle to regain zero-Covid. More than two years into the pandemic, China is the last major government still committed to the policy, determined that even the uber-transmissable Omicron variant will be controlled through mass testing, travel curbs and lockdowns. China’s officials maintain their approach is the best for both lives and the economy, and they have no choice but to hold firm on their approach. China’s booster and vaccination rates, especially among the elderly, are not high enough and its medical system not sufficiently resourced or geographically equitable to avoid catastrophic illness and death. “We try to run faster than the virus,” Li Bin, deputy director of the China’s National Health Commission, said on Friday. “No matter how the virus evolves we always put people and their lives first.” Foreign analysts and health experts agree China can’t open up yet. They also point to questions over the efficacy of its domestic vaccines, and the refusal of the government to approve foreign-made vaccines. Even if it did, a year of propaganda criticising them has likely ensured few people will be keen. But the analysts also fear China won’t join the world in living with Covid even when conditions are better. They say zero-Covid is so deeply tied to the political legitimacy of the Chinese Communist party and its leader, Xi Jinping, that there is no off ramp. As the impact of zero-Covid chafes the people’s will and the economy’s health, and a growing outbreak in the capital, that legitimacy may be under threat. “The CCP’s political legitimacy of power lies in its ability to provide livelihood, safety and health. They have to show their competency,” said Prof Chi Chunhuei, the director of Oregon State University’s centre for global health. “But local leaders also face a dilemma because they’re also tasked with improving or increasing China’s economic growth.” Zero Covid has undoubtedly saved lives, but other consequences of keeping the policy are biting. Economic analysts are forecasting continuing slowdowns in growth, and investors pulled a record $17.5bn in stocks and bonds out of China’s market in March. Cargo ships and trucks have been backed up at ports and roads, factories stalled and warehouses at capacity. Foreign firms have pulled out of the Shanghai, or reported major problems in attracting and retaining talent. Finance workers and international teachers are reportedly packing up and leaving. Online and in Shanghai, there is a significant and public amount of domestic frustration which police and censors are struggling to keep up with. In apparent acknowledgement of the toll the pandemic was taking, last month Xi ordered officials to succeed with zero Covid but “at the least cost and [to] minimise the impact of the epidemic on economic and social development”. This month Xi called for all-out efforts to spur infrastructure spending, pushing public development in a bid to drive the economy forward. There is very little space for officials to question Xi’s Covid goals, saysProf Carl Minzner, China scholar and professor of law at Fordham Law School, but resistance is there. “There are people in bureaucracy who realise the real cost this is imposing on citizens,” says Minzner. “But when politics is in command there isn’t this space for anything to rise up as reasoned discourse.” Dissenting opinions among the political and medical elite are occasionally going public but are quickly scrubbed from the internet, and years of Xi’s anti-graft purges have removed or silenced many political opponents. Later this year the CCP will hold its twice-a-decade congress, at which Xi is expected to seek an unprecedented third term as leader. In recent years it’s been spoken of as largely inevitable, but the timing and impact of China’s worst outbreak, as well as the Ukraine war, has upset the stability he likely hoped would see him confidently through. “There is some potential that a failure of zero-Covid, now he’s taken such clear responsibility for it, is a challenge to Xi,” says Prof Mary Gallagher, a political scientist and China expert with the university of Michigan. “We’re in uncharted waters in how these transitions work. With constitutional amendments [introduced in 2018 to remove term limits] Xi is expected to get his third term but it’s very unclear to see how it would actually happen.” Gallagher says the political elite is the most divided she’s seen it since 1989, over not just Covid, but also the economy and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “We know there is debate among the elites. Unfortunately it’s hitting up against a time period for Xi Jinping which makes it very dangerous to open up.” Shanghai’s attempts to avoid the lockdown were potentially overconfidence, says Gallagher, or an example of dissent among leaders who wanted to go a different way, says Chi. “Shanghai is the largest city with the richest health and medical care resources,” Chi says, arguing the reason officials initially resisted a lockdown was because it would send a ripple effect throughout the nation: “If the best resourced city has to lockdown [to contain an outbreak] then what happens to other cities?” But it backfired as cases overwhelmed the city, forcing 25 million people into lockdown anyway. After five weeks, Shanghai officials announced on Friday that more than 12 million people in districts now deemed low risk were able to leave their homes, but residents say there are still issues. Wang Yi-chun, a 27-year-old Shanghai resident who did not want to use her real name, says she’s been allowed to leave her apartment, but rules change quickly and without notice, and she wishes she’d left the city when she had the chance. “Before the lockdown in Shanghai, I never imagined that things would go to this level,” Wang says. “I thought they’d have some process that prepared them to face situations like this. But they didn’t have any.No solution has been developed during all this time. I don’t understand what they are doing right now.” Beijing is now reporting dozens of cases a day, but as of Friday was only locking down individual residences and venues. Aside from panic buying things seem calm as residents in affected districts report for testing. There is faith in Beijing’s authorities doing a better job than Shanghai’s, but still with the usual arsenal of measures. “Xi Jinping declared victory over the virus in 2020, and [pandemic] success has become emblematic of his own personal political success, ” says Minzner. “Unless Xi himself decides to back down politically, I find it difficult to imagine how China retreats from a zero-Covid policy.” Additional reporting by Xiaoqian Zhu and Chi Hui Lin",News/World news,"As China looks on at a world opening up, can Xi Jinping survive zero-Covid?",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/29/china-xi-jinping-zero-covid-lockdown-vaccination
4/29/2022,"“I’m going to become the Joker” is some of the internet’s most poignant shorthand. Referencing Todd Phillips’ dark 2019 film about the origins of the Batman villain, the phrase describes becoming so thoroughly disillusioned that one loses faith in everything. Data about mental health suggests that even the most preternaturally chipper among us have tasted the Joker pill during the pandemic. But what if that Jokerfication is not fleeting? And what if it’s happening at a cultural, societal and institutional level? This is the epochal question – because both parties’ leaders have accepted Jokerfication as the new permanent normal, and the Biden White House is actively convincing a generation to believe nothing will fundamentally change. President Joe Biden started out in a much different direction. Right after being sworn in, he signed an American Rescue Plan that rightly provided direct economic aid to millions of non-rich people. As poverty subsequently dropped, Biden’s poll numbers temporarily rose, seemingly halting the ascent of Republicans’ authoritarian mob. But now things have stalled, and Biden seems intent on accelerating – rather than combating – a rising tide of disillusionment. Tossing the Republican party a lifeline, he has reverted to his familiar formula:he promises big changes that could help the working class – and then prevents those changes from happening. He speechifies about the need to address crises he then makes worse. He blames Congress for gridlock but will not pressure lawmakers or use his executive authority to do things. He promises policy reforms that his own agencies decline to implement. The public seems to sense the gaslighting: Biden’s approval ratings are plummeting and anti-government sentiment has spiked as his strategy Joker-pills the country. As his poll numbers crater, Biden appears to be offering no course correction, and he still hasn’t signed a stack of executive orders on matters ranging from debt cancellation to drug pricing. Caught between the electorate and Democrats’ campaign sponsors, he appears to have decided that he cannot – or does not want to – stop the spread of the Joker pill. So he is now just mainlining its active ingredients into America’s veins with bold promises and even bolder betrayals. Consider a brief list: Biden promised a $15 minimum wage, and then he and his party promptly abandoned that initiative. Biden pledged to halt drilling on federal land and spent the first year of his presidency promising climate action – all while he outpaces Donald Trump’s drill-baby-drill initiatives and deploys his spokespeople to brag about flooding the world with fossil fuels amid the ecological emergency. He has also been using his executive authority to ramp up methane-emitting natural gas exports. Biden promised an “immediate cancellation of a minimum of $10,000 of federal student loan debt” – which he has the executive authority to do at any moment. But he’s been refusing to do it and has been trying to overturn bankruptcy court victories for the most beleaguered debtors. Biden pledged to protect traditional Medicare and “give Americans a new choice, a public health insurance option”. Then he never again mentioned the public option when he became president. Instead, he is helping his healthcare industry donors further privatize Medicare and reap even more subsidies as insurers reduce coverage, rake in record profits and jack up premiums. Biden continues to insist he wants to lower the predatory cost of medicine and distribute vaccine recipes to halt the global spread of Covid. At the same time, he has refused to invoke his executive authority to reduce the price of medicines that were developed with public funding – he has effectively abandoned his Covid vaccine pledge, and he’s intervening in a primary to endorse a Democratic lawmaker who gutted his own drug pricing bill. Biden portrays himself as a union supporter and promised to “ensure federal contracts only go to employers who sign neutrality agreements committing not to run anti-union campaigns”. Yet he abandoned his campaign pledge to rein in union-busting federal contractors, he has not implemented his own labor taskforce’s weak recommendations, and his administration gave Amazon a $10bn contract while the company fought labor organizers. If this pile of Joker pills wasn’t poisonous enough, down-ballot Democrats have mimicked the behavior. For example, Democratic senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema have been on a tour defending billionaires, fossil fuel companies and pharmaceutical conglomerates. Over in the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi made a media spectacle out of defending legislators profiting off well-timed stock trades as they receive inside information from their government jobs. Meanwhile, the Congressional Progressive Caucus leadership has spent its time demoralizing the progressive base, betraying promises to hold the line on important policy priorities. In the face of all this, Democrats’ campaign apparatus has gotten downright desperate. It is now airing ads boasting about a “historic middle-class tax cut”, a tax credit that has already expired, and an insulin price cap that hasn’t actually been passed into law – as if no one will be infuriated by those realities, even though data suggests many voters already are. Amid an explosion of child poverty following the end of the expanded child tax credit, the Washington commentariat wonders why so many polls show an electorate enraged at Democrats — and it’s certainly true that right-wing media has successfully duped a chunk of voters into not believing some basic economic realities. But the real story here is more than the Fox News effect. It’s full-scale Jokerfication. Americans’ lived experiences with the climate crisis and with increasing costs for healthcare, housing, energy, higher education, and retirement have made two things clear: 1) The economy has been so rigged by tax loopholes, trade deals, deregulation, and corporate subsidies that even with good macro data, many Americans are getting pulverized. Indeed, inflation-adjusted wages are declining, most people are still getting crushed by the costs of basic necessities, and the threat of climate ecocide is growing. 2) Politicians may say encouraging things on television and Twitter feeds, but they are not doing what’s necessary to permanently improve things for anyone other than corporate and billionaire donors – whose profits and net worths are booming. You can see how these realizations are Joker-pilling the country by looking at three emblematic data points. There is the poll showing Democrats losing their edge among voters who were cut off from the child tax credit. There are surveys showing Biden’s plummeting numbers among core Democratic constituencies that feel betrayed by his policies and actions. And now there are polls showing his numbers have so disintegrated among younger voters that he is below where even Trump was among that age group, which has seen a rise in deaths of despair as they face “almost no chance of being able to afford a house”, can’t afford the cost of having children, are being hammered by college debt and confront a climate apocalypse. This generation may not be Arthur Fleck dancing down stairways, but the Gotham City vibe of desperation is real. Heading into the midterms, both corporate media and the Republican party see their self-interest in helping Democrats completely Jokerfy the entire country into believing absolutely nothing can be done – other than burn everything to the ground. The former is lately focused on flogging the idea that inflation isn’t about what it’s actually about: corporations using monopoly power to jack up prices, lobbyist-written trade policies that off-shored supply chains, pandemic-related production shortages, and huge pay increases for the yacht set. Instead, media millionaires paid by billionaires are promoting all nihilism all the time, asking viewers to believe inflation is mostly the result of the government trying to temporarily help poor people survive Covid. Republican leaders, meanwhile, are promising nothing but the business end of a legislative flamethrower. House Republicans are proposing budget cuts that would incinerate Medicare and Medicaid. Senator Rick Scott is proposing to scorch the poor with tax increases. And Senator Mitt Romney suggested that America should consider torching workers’ retirement benefits. And so here we are, arriving at Jokerfied America – a conflagration that Franklin Roosevelt feared, where more and more people don’t believe in democratic government at all. If this inferno feels familiar, that’s because it is. It was not long ago that Obama’s Wall Street fealty and Hillary Clinton’s “it will never, ever happen” campaign so disenchanted voters that the country elected a Joker to the presidency. The 2020 election was a reprieve, but that is now starting to look like merely a momentary rest stop on a nihilistic road trip hurtling toward 2022 and beyond. That journey doesn’t mean nothing good is happening. In fact, the accelerated disillusionment with politicians and electoralism may end up prompting a different, more direct kind of constructive politics. For example, it is no coincidence that as young people and workers lose faith in the political system, America has experienced an upsurge of labor organizing campaigns, and the population’s approval of unions has hit record highs. The same trend may happen with the climate movement and ballot activism for economic causes that actually help workers. But those positive developments will compete with the noxious effects of the Joker pill – bigotry, xenophobia, self-centric greed, misinformation, right-wing vigilantism, and incitements to violence. With Trump as its clown face, the Maga movement is channeling mass disaffection into ever-more-malicious culture wars that demonize minorities, the LGBTQ community, socialists, unionists, academics, protesters, and anyone else who can be other-ized and scapegoated. Those rightwing tactics are so cynical they almost seem like a gag. But as Joker reminds us, there is no punchline. In a country where “I don’t believe in anything” is fast becoming the zeitgeist, the scheme is likely to work – unless those in power start delivering for the working class.

4/29/2022,"Ralf Rangnick believes Manchester United’s recruitment policy should target “future top players” such as Erling Haaland, though he called for realism given competition from Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester City. Erik ten Hag will take over as the manager in the close season, when Rangnick’s role is to change from being the interim manager to a consultant who will help identify transfer targets. “My opinion is the club should try to find future top players and try to develop them,” he said. “Haaland is 21; this is one of those players. He has developed into one of the most expensive strikers in the world. He would be one of those examples I think the emphasis should be on: that we should try and convince players who should be Manchester United players for the next years.” United’s 1-1 draw with Chelsea on Thursday leaves them sixth, five behind fourth-placed Arsenal, who have two games in hand. This means Champions League qualification is remote and with United also having failed to challenge for the title for nine years, Rangnick was asked whether emerging high-class footballers would wish to join. He said: “As a club with these supporters, the stadium, quality of training ground, I would say yes, but as soon as other clubs like Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City are involved you need some good reasons. Someone needs to explain to the players and that is why it is important what Erik thinks. “I know from Jürgen [Klopp, Liverpool’s manager] and Thomas [Tuchel, Chelsea’s manager] that if they want players they talk to them and the same is probably true of Pep [Guardiola at City]: he speaks to them and find out about their mentality and character and if they are the right fit.” Rangnick offered clarification of his consultancy position. “For me the most important bit is recruitment, that we bring in the best possible players,” ,” he said. “It is not only identifying but meeting them, convincing them to join the club even though we will not play in Champions League. In regards to top players from the academy: identify them.” Jadon Sancho may be ruled out for the last three games because of tonsillitis, Rangnick added.",Sport/Football,Rangnick calls on Manchester United to recruit ‘future top players’ like Haaland,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/29/ralf-rangnick-calls-on-manchester-united-recruit-future-top-players-like-erling-haaland
4/29/2022,"The head of the EU border agency Frontex has filed his resignation following excoriating criticism of its human rights record and an anti-fraud investigation. Fabrice Leggeri, who was censured by the European parliament last year, announced his resignation in a letter to the agency’s management board. “I give my mandate back to the management board as it seems that the Frontex mandate on which I have been elected and renewed in June 2019 has silently but effectively been changed,” Leggeri wrote in a letter seen by the Guardian. According to the letter, his resignation is yet to be accepted by the Frontex board, which was holding an emergency meeting to discuss his position on Friday. The letter was dated the same day as an international consortium of journalists, including the Guardian, revealed that Frontex’s database showed it was involved in illegal pushbacks, forcing asylum seekers trying to enter Greece back to Turkey. The resignation also follows a separate investigation by the EU’s anti-fraud agency, Olaf. A spokesperson for Olaf confirmed an investigation into Frontex was closed on 15 February, but declined to make any further comment, citing confidentiality rules to protect the people involved and “possible follow-up in administrative and judicial proceedings”. It remains unclear whether the criticism from rights groups or the Olaf investigation played any role in his decision to quit. Leggeri, a French national who held senior posts in his country’s interior and defence ministries, has led Frontex since 2015, a period when it was transformed from an obscure EU agency into a central plank of the EU border control policy. After the 2015 migration crisis, EU leaders agreed to give the Warsaw-based agency more powers, staff and money. By 2027, Frontex is due to have 10,000 border and coast guards and its budget has already increased more than 19-fold since its creation in 2006. As Frontex’s executive director, Leggeri has faced heavy criticism, including from a special committee at the European parliament that last year accused the agency of failing to protect the human rights of asylum seekers. The cross-party committee said Frontex had carried out only a superficial investigation into alleged illegal pushbacks at the EU’s borders. Leggeri was personally criticised for his failure to appoint 40 human rights monitors as required under EU law, while lavishly staffing his own private office. MEPs found he had appointed 63 people to his private office, more than twice the number of people working in the cabinet of president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. Neither Leggeri nor Frontex have so far commented publicly on his position. A spokesperson for the European Commission said the Frontex board would “communicate on its conclusions” after Friday’s extraordinary meeting. Frontex has a “critically important task, which is to help member states to protect the common EU external borders and to uphold at the same time the fundamental rights in doing so”, the commission spokesperson added. “And to achieve this, Frontex must have in place a stable and well functioning agency.” The German MEP Birgit Sippel, who speaks for the Socialist group on home affairs, said Leggeri’s resignation was long overdue. She said: “For years, Leggeri has mismanaged the EU’s border and coastguard agency, significantly harming its reputation and misleading the parliament along the way. The evidence of the need for fresh leadership has mounted since then, and we will scrutinise the succession closely.”",News/World news,Head of EU border agency Frontex resigns amid criticisms,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/29/head-of-eu-border-agency-frontex-resigns-amid-criticisms-fabrice-leggeri
4/29/2022,"Environmental campaigners are threatening the water services regulation authority in England and Wales with legal action over its failure to take action to prevent untreated sewage discharges into rivers by water companies. Lawyers for Wild Justice believe Ofwat has a duty under law to ensure sewage treatment plants avoid releasing polluting discharge into watercourses. Leigh Day, acting for the group, argues correspondence with the regulator shows that the authority is failing to take the necessary monitoring and enforcement action against water companies. They say the failure to act creates a threat to wildlife from the excessive nutrient levels in rivers and other water bodies caused by the pollution. While the Environment Agency issues permits to water companies to deal with sewage, Ofwat also has powers to ensure sewage plants are designed and operated correctly, lawyers argue, under the Urban Waste Water Treatment (England and Wales) Regulations 1994 and section 94 of the Water Industry Act 1991. Carol Day, a solicitor from Leigh Day, said: “While the public are rightly frustrated with the Environment Agency for an apparent reluctance to prosecute water companies for breaches of permits, there’s an underlying question as to whether our Victorian sewage treatments plants are still fit for purpose. “The responsibility for ascertaining the position on that – and for requiring action where they are not – lies with Ofwat but it appears to be doing nothing to solve that underlying problem. Our clients hope that highlighting Ofwat’s duties in this regard will ensure the necessary steps are taken to upgrade our outdated sewage plants.” Environment Agency data shows water companies in England discharged raw sewage into rivers and seas for more than 2.7m hours in 2021, in 372,533 incidents. A public outcry at the scale of raw sewage discharges, which are supposed to take place only after exceptional rainfall, has forced the government to act, saying the level of releases are totally unacceptable. It is consulting on a plan to reduce discharges , promising that by 2040, 40% will have been eliminated. But campaigners say this the plan lacks urgency. Wild Justice, founded by Dr Mark Avery, Chris Packham and Dr Ruth Tingay, wants to see Ofwat doing more to tackle the problem. “It’s not so much Ofwat as Ofwhere? They are missing in action. Our rivers and their wildlife need Ofwat to get active,” the organisation said. It argues that the urban waste water treatment regulations require Ofwat to collect data about the design and operation of sewage plants. But the regulator has said in correspondence it relies entirely on data gathered for that purpose by the Environment Agency. Wild Justice says the agency has told them it has no direct function in monitoring or enforcing the obligations, which is a matter for Ofwat. Wild Justice alleges Ofwat is entirely passive in relation to enforcement and has taken no steps to obtain information relating to compliance by water companies in relation to their sewage treatment plants. Lawyers make the allegations in a pre-action protocol letter, the initial step before a threatened judicial review of Ofwat’s actions. An Ofwat spokesperson said: “We have recently received a letter from Leigh Day on behalf of Wild Justice and we intend to respond to it fully in due course. We have not yet had an opportunity to do so and it would not be appropriate to comment further at this point.”",News/Environment,Ofwat could face legal action over sewage discharges in rivers,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/29/ofwat-could-face-legal-action-over-sewage-discharges-in-rivers
