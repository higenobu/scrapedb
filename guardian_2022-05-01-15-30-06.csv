5/1/2022,"Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, is unlikely to have given up his ambitions to seize Kyiv after losing the battle for the city this spring, Britain’s ambassador to Ukraine warned as she returned to work in the wartime capital. Melinda Simmons, who has moved back to Kyiv despite Russian threats against diplomats based there, said it was “overwhelming” to be back in a city that she once feared she might not see again. “I wasn’t sure I’d make it back to Kyiv, so coming back is an extraordinary thing,” she said in her first interview from the capital since evacuating the embassy in February. “It absolutely feels like the right place to be.” Simmons drove into the city from western Ukraine late on Friday, a journey along a highway battered by some of the most brutal Russian assaults. The charred remnants of destroyed buildings that line miles of highway are testament to the intensity of the fighting. “It’s helpful to drive because you get a real sense of what was going on … and it’s truly shocking. But what is equally extraordinary is to see how Ukraine kept Russia out of Kyiv. Every way in which Ukraine has been able to do that is a thing to to celebrate and to treasure.” Moscow has shifted its focus to a new offensive in the east and south after retreating from Kyiv, at least for now. “I think Putin would certainly want to give it another try if he thought he was making progress,” Simmons said. But even in the east, after concentrating their forces for a new offensive, Russian’s military has struggled. It is appearing to repeat some of the tactical mistakes it made around the capital and is bearing heavy losses on the frontline. Around the city of Kharkiv, Ukrainian forces made some gains against Russia, despite heavy shelling that killed one and injured five. The Pentagon spokesperson, John Kirby, on Friday briefly choked with emotion as he described the destruction in Ukraine and denounced Putin’s “depravity”. Ukrainian prosecutors say they have pinpointed more than 8,000 war crimes by Russian troops and are investigating 10 Russian soldiers for suspected atrocities in Bucha near Kyiv. It has been a month since the Ukrainian army pushed Russia out of the Kyiv region, yet police and volunteers are still finding new graves. The gradual return of many western ambassadors to Kyiv has served as a show of confidence and solidarity for the government of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who on Friday welcomed Simmons back by name in his video address to the nation. Perhaps for that reason, Russia has threatened to target foreign diplomats in the capital, which it hit with missile strikes that killed a journalist during a visit by the UN secretary general António Guterreslast week. “I’m not minimising it. I’m not discounting it. You have to take it into account, but I’m still here,” Simmons said, pointing out that she was not a lone potential target. “[There are 27 ambassadors here] so that’s quite a lot of diplomats to target,” she said. “I am here with a heightened level of security protection and bearing in mind that potential risk, but for now I feel comfortable working under those circumstances.” She said that despite strong Ukrainian resistance, and Russia’s failings, the war is not likely to end soon. “You are looking at quite a long game … certainly through this year and probably through next year”, and effectively warned that Kyiv will not be safe until Russia has been defeated. “Politically, I don’t doubt that Putin’s objectives for Ukraine have not changed, even though their tanks had to withdraw back to the north from Kyiv,” she said. “I can also see that the Kyiv city administration and the Ukraine armed forces are not taking that gain for granted at all. And they’re right.” Asked whether the UK thought Ukraine should try to push the struggling Russian military out of the country altogether, and reclaim Crimea, she said the first military focus should be reclaiming territory seized since the invasion began. “The most important thing right now is to push Russia back to where they were before February … because that’s where the existential threat lies. Let’s get to that stage. And then let’s see,” she said. But she added that the UK “has never recognised the illegal annexation of Crimea”, or the separatist claims on the Donbas region, and that those land grabs now have “an awful lot more profile than they did before the invasion. It’s focused an awful lot more people’s attention on it. So let’s see how that translates itself.” The British government is in touch with families of two aid workers who have been detained by Russian forces, but continues to advise citizens not to travel to Ukraine for any reason, she said. A British citizen was killed fighting for Ukraine last week. “That has to be (an individual) choice, but our advice is really clear. That nobody should be doing this because it’s not safe,” she said, adding that despite her return, the embassy has not reopened in Kyiv and they are not running a consular service.",News/World news,"Kyiv is ‘the right place to be’, says UK ambassador after returning to city",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/01/kyiv-is-the-right-place-to-be-says-uk-ambassador-after-returning-to-city
5/1/2022,"Company directors fear the cost of living crisis and tumbling consumer confidence will cause greater harm than previously estimated, increasing the risk of an economic downturn this year, according to a major new study. The Institute of Directors (IoD) said in a survey last month that a lack of confidence in the economic outlook was “the number one issue” facing British businesses as inflationary pressures combined with the uncertainty caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine to heighten the risk of a recession. A measure of business-leader optimism in the economy, the directors’ economic confidence index fell to -36 in April from -4 in February. City analysts and economists have become increasingly concerned that the UK’s rebound from the pandemic is quickly running out of steam following steep rises in the price of gas, electricity, petrol and food. Shortages of staff across industries such as IT, manufacturing, construction and hospitality are also forcing employers to pay signing-on fees, bonuses and higher wages to secure employees with the necessary skills. The Bank of England is expected to increase interest rates this week in response to a jump in inflation to 7% in March, adding further pressure on indebted businesses and households that rely on credit to make ends meet. Officials at the central bank will publish their latest forecasts for the economy, which are likely to show it contracting in the second quarter in response to a decline in household spending power. A separate study by the consultants EY-Parthenon revealed the number of profit warnings issued by UK-listed companies soared by 44% year on year in the first quarter of 2022, with a record number of firms citing rising costs for the weaker performance. The report found that UK-listed companies issued 72 warnings in the first three months of 2022 – the highest quarterly figure since the start of the pandemic. A record-breaking 43% of warnings was due to rising costs, up from 27% in Q4 2021 and well above the 2011-21 average of 10%. Alan Hudson, a partner at the firm, said: “Inflationary pressures, which had been building throughout 2021, were already putting pressure on company margins and consumers’ real incomes. “The war in Ukraine has contributed to greater supply-side pressures and raised questions about confidence and demand in 2022. We are now looking at a year with ongoing Covid-19 disruption alongside higher inflation, greater uncertainty and faster monetary tightening than we expected just a few months ago.” Kitty Ussher, chief economist at the IoD, said the invasion of Ukraine had “sent shock waves around British boardrooms”. She said some businesses were beginning to plan and consider new investments, but “optimism in the UK economy itself remains very low and is now the number one issue seen as having a negative impact on businesses, even above the other very real pressures of high energy costs, difficulties in the labour market and problems with international supply chains”.",News/Business,"Economic downturn likely, the Institute of Directors warns",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/01/economic-downturn-likely-the-institute-of-directors-warns
5/1/2022,"At a “slave auction” at the Oxford Union in 1987 – an “opportunity to buy your favourite union person for the evening” – there was, according to the university newspaper, frenzied bidding for the services of the kilt-wearing 19-year-old Michael Gove. He went for £35. Gove was known at the time as one of the three pre-eminent orators in the small world of the university debating chamber – the others were Nick Robinson, future BBC political editor, and Simon Stevens, until recently chief executive of NHS England. The previous year’s union president, Boris Johnson, failed to show up for the slave auction and was sold in absentia. Johnson’s own rhetorical style differed from the self-conscious rigour of his peers. He had learned, Simon Kuper writes, in debates at Eton, “to defeat opponents whose arguments were better simply by ignoring their arguments”. He offered instead “carefully timed jokes, calculated lowerings of the voice, and ad hominem jibes”. In this manner, he had won the election to union presidency with the help of various self-described “votaries in the Boris cult”, including Gove and future Covid sceptic Toby Young. The Johnson style was – Kuper notes in this short, sharp and often disturbing examination of how our current politics was first played out at Oxford half a lifetime ago – something new. For maybe 30 years at Oxford, Tories had been in defensive retreat. The manner of Johnson’s immediate Conservative predecessors at the union, Theresa Brasier, her husband-to-be Philip May and her best friend (and future deputy prime minister) Damian Green, was notably halting and circumspect. But by 1984, emboldened by the twin forces of Falklands-era Thatcherism and Brideshead Revisited on the telly, archaic Tory voices – carefully laced with ironies by Johnson – were raucous again. (David Cameron, two years below Johnson at school and Oxford, was a different kind of throwback – rich enough and connected enough to feel himself above the “hackery” of student politics.) It helped this new breed, Kuper argues, that at the union, they were often joking among themselves. The Oxford University Labour Club, high on Billy Bragg and miners’ solidarity marches, boycotted the debating chamber (one result, Kuper suggests, was that they “never learned to speak”). The political big beasts on the left in the second half of the 80s, in university terms, were the Miliband brothers, Dave and Ted, and Eddie Balls and Yvette Cooper, organising rent protests at their respective colleges. The young Keir Starmer, who did his undergraduate degree at Leeds, arrived in 1985 and made a stand about supporting the print workers at Wapping. Johnson could raise predictable guffaws in union debates when characterising socialist students as “retreating into their miserable dungareed caucuses”. All of which is to say: if you thought you knew the extent of the stubbornly incestuous Oxford networks that currently sit at the top of our politics, this book will still surprise you. Financial Times columnist Kuper himself arrived at Oxford in 1988, just after Gove and Johnson had left. Kuper, from a north London comprehensive school, mostly inhabited a different social world to the subjects of his book but, like them, he acknowledges, he was trained by his Oxford humanities degree primarily “to write and speak for a living without much knowledge”. He is scathing of those habits of tutorial teaching at the university, which too frequently rewarded bluffing and charm over industry and doubt. Still, this is not, he insists, “a personal revenge on Oxford”. It’s rather “an attempt to write a group portrait of a set of Tory Brexiteers… who took an ancient route through Oxford to power”. As Johnson himself remarked, if you wanted to know how influential the Oxford Union was in British politics, you had only to look at all the photographs of past presidents (and future prime ministers) on its walls. There was, however, one distinct difference between those characters and their 1980s pretenders. As Kuper observes, the politicians of Anthony Eden and Harold Macmillan’s vintage had been shaped not only by Eton and Oxford but also by war. By 2007, Rory Stewart – who had gone from Eton and Oxford to Iraq and Afghanistan – was observing that in the upper echelons of the Tory party: “Churchill had been replaced by Bertie Wooster.” Kuper argues that though the clique around Johnson believed they were born to power, unlike the swashbucklers of empire they admired, they lacked a cause to fight for. His book details how that “cause” was eventually drummed up by three other near contemporaries at Oxford, all of whom fell under the sway of Norman Stone, the polymathic history professor, alcoholic and sometime adviser to Margaret Thatcher. The first of those was a young Scot, Patrick Robertson, introduced to Stone by Gove at a Burns Night dinner, the second was Dan, now Lord, Hannan, and the third was the most intense of undergraduates, Dominic Cummings. It was Stone who personally nurtured Cummings’s public schoolboy anarchy and who persuaded him to head to Russia after his degree to get a feel for the post-cold war world. Robertson, meanwhile, partly inspired by the historian’s abhorrence of the EU, left Oxford after his second year to devote himself to the Bruges Group of Eurosceptics that he set up while at the university. (Robertson, Kuper points out, now lives in St Moritz, where he runs the public relations firm WorldPR, responsible for the post-Brexit “global Britain” campaign. He is also Kazakhstan’s honorary consul to the Bahamas.) Hannan, among Kuper’s key witnesses here, had grown up in Peru, where his family had a poultry farm. After the collapse of communism, he sniffed – along with Stone – a new “enemy of liberty” in European bureaucracy and found an early acolyte in his absurd Oxford contemporary Jacob Rees-Mogg. On graduating, Hannan persuaded some marginal rightwing MPs to pay him a salary as sole employee of the European Research Group; two decades later he was persuading Johnson to head the leave campaign. And so, as Kuper writes, once again “the timeless paradise of Oxford inspired its inhabitants to produce timeless fantasies like Alice in Wonderland, The Hobbit, Narnia, and, incubating from the late 1980s, Brexit”. It goes without saying, reading this history, that the overwhelming influence of a single kind of graduate from a single university (and often a single school, Eton) at the top of British public life has been profoundly damaging. Kuper offers some solutions – making Oxford exclusively a graduate research institute is one – but also hopes that the pandemic and all that has followed from it might finally mark an end to the British weakness for “the amateur ruler, lightly seasoned by Oxford tutorials”. If so, a suitable epitaph might come from Rees-Mogg, who when challenged in October 2021 as to why Tory MPs were not wearing face masks in parliament, answered: “We on this side know each other.” As if that were all that ever counted.

5/1/2022,"Menopause campaigners have warned of a further surge in demand for already stretched hormone replacement therapy (HRT) supplies ahead of a documentary on the issue by Davina McCall, which will be broadcast on Monday. They accused the government, which last week announced a new HRT tsar amid widespread shortages of the drug, of “paying lip service” to women and women’s health. One pharmaceutical company reported a 30% rise in demand for HRT products the month after McCall, now 54, made her first documentary on the subject in 2021 – and huge numbers of women are expected to seek HRT from GPs for the first time after watching the new Channel 4 show. The makers of Davina McCall: Sex, Mind and the Menopause said they expect the programme to inspire “another wave of women to go to their GPs” to ask for HRT. They also expect a surge in demand for testosterone, whose potential benefits are also highlighted in the programme. The documentary comes after a week in which shortages of certain HRT products have led to reports of some women feeling suicidal, and of being forced to ration or trade the drugs in carparks and seek solutions abroad. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “The health secretary has been clear he will leave no stone unturned to ensure women can get the HRT they need. “This week we took decisive action to boost supply and make sure women can access HRT. We have appointed Madelaine McTernan as head of the HRT taskforce to address supply issues in the short and long term, and have issued serious shortage protocols on three HRT products to limit dispensing to three months’ supply and even out distribution of in-demand products.” But Carolyn Harris, the Labour MP for Swansea East, chair of the menopause all-party parliamentary group and co-chair of the menopause taskforce, said even more women would rush to acquire HRT this week. “Things are going to come up in that documentary that people are not going to believe. And we’ll have more and more women rushing to their doctor to get on HRT,” she told the Observer. “The more we find out about what happens to your body when you lose the hormones, the more we recognise that menopause does a huge amount of damage to a woman. But it’s very repairable damage.” She accused the government of failing to say how it would get the drug into pharmacies. “There’s a shortage of HRT, and the government are paying lip service by coming forwards with a tsar … when in reality we know what the problem is and what they need to do about it.” Harris, who is a member of the campaign group Menopause Mandate along with McCall and fellow broadcasters Mariella Frostrup and Penny Lancaster, called for a national formulary to increase availability. She said she was inundated with “caseloads” of women whose GPs had declined to give them HRT, saying they didn’t need it or were not menopausal. The issue particularly affects women on low incomes who can’t go private, she said. McCall’s first menopause documentary, Sex, Myths and the Menopause, in which the presenter talked about her own experiences, was watched by more than 2 million people and resulted in 22,000 GPs and nurses volunteering to complete a six-hour menopause course. Kate Muir, who produced both films and is the author of Everything You Need to Know About the Menopause (but were too afraid to ask), said she believes the new documentary will encourage menopausal women to seek testosterone from their doctors too. McCall is part of a wider menopause movement that is challenging the notion of “keep calm and carry on and shut up”. She added. “Women themselves until recently somehow felt they didn’t deserve this [HRT] and they felt ashamed of it and ashamed to ask for it. They felt it was a sign of weakness. And now it’s a sign of strength.” The number of HRT prescriptions in England has doubled in the past five years to more than 500,000 a month. In previous years, shortages were blamed on manufacturing and supply chain problems, but the industry has put recent problems down to more women seeking the products. Professor Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said there had been an “exponential rise in demand” for transdermal oestrogen products in recent years, but the rise in women being prescribed HRT was “testament to GPs wanting to do their best for their patients”. He said GPs were “highly trained to have open and sensitive conversations about all aspects of women’s health, including menopause”. Paula Briggs, chair of the British Menopause Society, has warned of “evangelistic” misinformation shared on social media based on “a selective interpretation of clinical research papers”, which has included recommending higher doses of HRT or saying it’s safe for women with a history of breast cancer in their family. “Unless you’ve done medical training and you understand, it’s easy to take a superficial approach,” she said, adding that some women felt pressured to take HRT when it might be better to try lifestyle changes first. Katie Taylor, founder of the Latte Lounge, an online platform about midlife and the menopause, said demand had increased rapidly over the past six years. For many women, the McCall documentary could be “their first lightbulb moment”, she said. Women are “very stressed, very anxious and a lot of them are desperate so they’re using half the amount [of HRT]”. Some women were driving to numerous pharmacies trying to get equivalent products, seeking private solutions, and others are even trying to get it over the counter in Spain, she said.",News/Society,HRT demand expected to surge after new Davina McCall film on menopause,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/01/hrt-demand-expected-to-surge-after-new-davina-mccall-film-on-menopause
5/1/2022,"The market town of Tiverton, which became prosperous in the 16th and 17th centuries thanks to its thriving wool trade, is usually a tranquil kind of place. But it was an uncomfortable spot to be on Saturday as townsfolk digested the news that their MP, Neil Parish, was under investigation for allegedly watching pornography in the House of Commons. “It’s a disgrace,” said Peter Moore, 74, a retired engineer who has lived in Devon all his life (“apart from six years serving in the county regiment”). “Of course he should resign. People used to fall on their swords but they don’t now. He should resign – and Boris Johnson should resign. It’s Trumpism, people don’t care now. There used to be honour, there’s no honour now, apart from honour among thieves.” Paul Graham, 54, a former mayor of Tiverton, heard Moore talking and couldn’t resist stopping and leaping in, with a different take. “In this country, we’re innocent until proven guilty,” he said. Graham, who works in manufacturing, warmed to his theme. “It’s upsetting for the town but we don’t want a byelection. I’ve voted for Neil three times and I’ll vote for him next time if I get the chance.” He won’t. By the afternoon, Parish had resigned. “The situation was that – funnily enough it was tractors I was looking at” he told the BBC. “I did get into another website that had a very similar name and I watched it for a bit which I shouldn’t have done. But my crime – biggest crime – is that on another occasion I went in a second time.” This weekend, the story about Parish watching porn in the Commons is the latest “off grid” disaster to hit Boris Johnson and the Tories, with just four days to go until crucial local elections. If the Conservatives do badly on Thursday many of Parish’s former colleagues could be tempted to submit letters of no confidence to Sir Graham Brady calling on Johnson to go, triggering what could be the beginning of the end for the prime minister. The West Country was already looking difficult enough for Johnson as Partygate, the cost of living crisis, and other Tory sleaze scandals made his campaign claims to be just “getting on with the job” and “delivering for the British people” ring rather hollow. On Friday on the rural north-eastern fringes Taunton in Somerset, where desperately needed new housing is spreading around meadows, cricket fields and old cider orchards, there was little enthusiasm for the Tory offer. Kim Linden, 57, a hairdresser, said she would be switching to the Lib Dems in Thursday’s local elections. “[The Tories] don’t tell the truth. [Boris Johnson] said ‘No we didn’t have parties’ but they did have parties,” she says, while being canvassed by the Lib Dems, on one of the sprawling, new-build estates. “And it’s not just that: everything is rising. Bills. Gas. Electric. Fuel. And they are not helping us. They are not putting anything in place for the future.” Other long-term Conservative voters on the private development were having doubts too. Their concerns are bad news for Johnson because the Lib Dems are eyeing a big comeback across large parts of the south-west and Tory-run Somerset county council is a key target. Dave Cardy, 52, a former police officer who now delivers prescriptions, said he had had enough of Johnson. “I thought he would become a sensible prime minister. But he has just carried on bumbling his way through life. Really, we need a grown-up in charge – Boris’s time is done,” he said. Look north, and similar views were being expressed on Friday behind the “red wall” that Johnson and his party breached with devastating effect at the 2019 general election. Results in councils such as Kirklees, which takes in Huddersfied and Wakefield, will be scrutinised as Labour seeks to win back control. Across the council area views are still mixed on the Labour leader Keir Starmer’s appeal and it is by no means all going his way. But there are some signs that opinion is slowly shifting in Labour’s direction. A hairdresser in Birstall, who asked not to be named, said she doesn’t see a way back for Johnson, because he was “completely guilty and knew what he was doing”. She added: “If you’ve lied about something then there’s always going to be mistrust.” Georgina Marshall, who switched from Labour to the Conservatives at the last general election was dismayed by Johnson for very personal reasons. “He carries on and carries on. I had a Christmas where I couldn’t see my mum; I didn’t see my 90-year-old grandma for two years. Meanwhile he’s partying with all his friends.” Labour could retake Kirklees council by gaining just three of the 23 seats up for election, after it slipped into no overall control following three defections in 2020. But failure to do so will be seen as evidence that the red wall will be stubbornly difficult to reconquer. Millions of voters will go to the polls across the UK on Thursday, with 6,800 seats being contested, including all council seats in Scotland and Wales. In Northern Ireland the first elections to the assembly will be held since the UK’s withdrawal from the EU. In England elections will take place in all London boroughs, 33 of 36 metropolitan boroughs, 60 out of 181 district councils, and 21 of 58 unitary authorities. Inevitably Labour, which did well when most of these seats were last contested in 2018, is downplaying its chances both regionally and nationally. Labour activists are pouring cold water on the idea of their party conquering the Tory strongholds of both Wandsworth and Westminster in London, while the Tories are saying Starmer’s party should make huge gains at this point in the electoral cycle. Back in Tiverton, there was dismay that the quiet had been disturbed for all the wrong reasons – and a weary sense that under Johnson and his team it would never end. Katy Oakley, 40, an ecologist, was walking through the town with her four-year-old daughter, Olive. “This sums up what everybody thinks about the government, another shocking incident in a long line. “I think it shows just how out of touch members of the elite are with normal society. They think they can get away with things that ordinary people couldn’t. “This isn’t brilliant publicity for our town – it puts Tiverton in a bad light. It’s not good for the country’s image abroad. And it’s not good for society.” Though he lives on his farm across the border in Somerset, Parish is a well-known figure in Tiverton. He was first elected 12 years ago and since then has doubled his majority. The North Devon Tory MP, Selaine Saxby, said Parish had always been a loyal and supportive colleague. But she expressed shock: “Nobody wants to think of their MP sat on the green benches watching videos full stop, certainly not this kind of video.” Happily for the Tories on Mid Devon district council, which is based in Tiverton, councillors are not up for election this spring. “I guess that’s a good thing,” said Ray Radford, a senior Conservative currently serving as the chairman of the council. At the indoor market, Jane Hall, 56, summed up much of the anger. “When people are scrimping and scraping, he’s sat there apparently watching porn. He should be sacked but he’s got Boris as his role model. He was having a party when people were dying.”",News/Politics,Porn shame adds to Tory woes in south-west as party fears poll blow,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/01/porn-shame-adds-to-tory-woes-in-south-west-as-party-fears-poll-blow
5/1/2022,"The Green the Church movement seeks “to expand the role of churches as centres for environmental resilience”. Its charismatic leader, Dr Ambrose Carroll, argues that communion with the natural world is fundamental to the past and future of his congregation: “We’re ex-slaves,” he says, “migrant farmers, people who spent eons with our hands in the ground. Even though we don’t speak the language of environmentalism, it’s very close to who we are.” Carroll’s ministry is one focus of photographer Lucas Foglia’s project about prayer in nature. Foglia’s own mission is clear, he says: “In a divided time in the United States, I want to point to a common ground. The people I photographed from every major religion share the belief that wild places are both a refuge and our responsibility.” This picture of a child, Omari, being lifted into magnolia blossom, on show later this month at a photography fair in New York, was taken at the annual open-water baptism ceremony that takes place in Atlanta, Georgia, each year. The prayer project is an evolution of Foglia’s continuing quest for contemporary Edens. He grew up on a family farm on Long Island. His parents were part of the back-to-the-land movement where food was grown for barter. Since 2006, he has travelled the country, often photographing off-grid communities, hippies and hunter-gatherers and religious sects, as well as the toxic effects of our industrialised exploitation of the natural world. This latest series is an attempt to locate some fundamental and shared sense of wonder in engagement with the environment. An advocate of wild spaces within cities, Foglia suggests that some of the urban places that still have the least plant life are urban school playgrounds. “It does always feel important to have [children] touch nature,” he says, “because it is through direct contact that we create empathy.”  Lucas Foglia’s work will be at The Photography Show presented by Aipad, Michael Hoppen gallery booth, Center415, New York, 20-22 May",Arts/Art and design,The big picture: a baptism among the magnolia blossoms in Atlanta,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/01/the-big-picture-a-baptism-among-the-magnolia-blossoms-in-atlanta
5/1/2022,"Not since his horror on hearing that lockdown-breaking parties had happened in his own home have we heard the prime minister so appalled by the behaviour of colleagues. Discovering, last week, that one of them had spoken repellently about Angela Rayner, he tweeted: “I deplore the misogyny directed at her anonymously today.” Because if you’re going to be misogynistic about female politicians, isn’t it always better to put your name to it, like, say, Boris Johnson when he analysed female contributions to a Labour conference? “Time and again the ‘Tottymeter’ has gone off as a young woman delegate mounts the rostrum.” Anonymous remarks – well, certainly ones in which perfectly standard Conservative objectifying have caused civilian offence – are a different matter. It was, Johnson said, “intolerable”. “I have to say I thought it was the most appalling load of sexist, misogynist tripe.” And believing as ever that an unrelated shred of cultural capital adds class to his gibberish, Johnson likened himself to another deluded leader who lost all authority. Paraphrasing King Lear: “If we ever find who is responsible for it, I don’t know what we will do, but they will be the terrors of the earth.” Perhaps we can help? Not that it narrows it down much, but could the choice of Basic Instinct, so foundational for Johnson’s more furtive cohort, perhaps point to another 50ish man, raised before Conservatives could enjoy, as they do now, uninhibited workplace access to porn? As for retribution, it is all too clear how Johnson’s party normally deals with a Conservative MP whose misogyny or sexual attitudes make him unfit for public office. It does sod all. Given the party’s recovery, unabashed, from the sort of #MeToo allegations that forced lasting reform in many other institutions, any terrors would be wildly inconsistent. Even with three cabinet ministers reportedly among the more than 50 MPs under investigation for sexual misconduct, there is little sign of the party’s accepting – like, however reluctantly, the Metropolitan police – that the risks of sheltering misogynists, predators and creeps may finally outweigh their traditionally respected role in its workforce. Just last month, Crispin Blunt MP, well known for his interest in legalising prostitution, declared the conviction of fellow Tory MP Imran Ahmad Khan for the sexual assault of a boy a “miscarriage of justice”. He remains at work. So do Conservative colleagues Stephen Crabb, whose sexually explicit texts to a 19-year-old interviewee merely “fell short” of party standards; Damian Green, demoted after sexual harassment and pornography allegations; and Rob Roberts, readmitted – the whip only suspended – after sexually harassing a junior member of staff. David Warburton, reportedly accused by three women of sexual harassment, is similarly suspended, pending investigation. Since elaborating on his personal struggles, Jamie Wallis, Westminster’s first trans MP, appears to have been exonerated for his earlier association with a sugar daddy website (“Are you a student, a single parent or just short of money?”). Johnson’s long history of workplace affairs with younger staff, right up to the one with a twentysomething favourite from party communications, we know about. Matt Hancock’s excuse for pandemic priapism: “I fell deeply in love.” It looked for a while as if porn enthusiast Neil Parish would loyally take a lead from his leader’s approach to party investigation and wait for an inquiry – this one to tell him if he liked perving at work. That was until he yesterday confessed to his “moment of madness”. That leaves the Basic Instinct briefer who could reasonably expect colleagues to offer at least as much support as was extended to Charlie Elphicke, the convicted sex offender whose wife, Natalie, inherited his constituents. The Conservatives’ signature line in defending the indefensible originates, in fact, well before #partygate, when the whips rescinded Elphicke’s suspension (for being under investigation for sexual assault), so he could vote. The Sunday Times reported on the Elphicke cover-up that five senior Conservative MPs – Mrs Elphicke, Roger Gale, Theresa Villiers, Adam Holloway and Bob Stewart – were subsequently forced to apologise or be suspended from the Commons “for improperly trying to influence a judge” on his behalf, an act “corrosive to the rule of law”. So while not, as far as we know, rivalling Charing Cross police station for professional depravity, the ruling party demonstrates scarcely more interest in respecting either women or normal workplace boundaries. The existence of the latest porn connoisseur was exposed when female Conservative MPs complained to their chief whip about intolerable sexism and harassment, presumably over and above the eminent cases of which he will be aware. Is the Conservative party especially attractive to sexual miscreants or does it take formerly respectful men and make them that way? Whatever the process, it accords with Johnson’s great man theory of history that leadership by a devotee of covert asymmetrical relationships, someone with a documented view of individual women as assemblages of sexual characteristics, would only exacerbate its institutionally sexist culture. If Westminster harassment is now as pervasive as even Nadine Dorries can remember, it is hard to see this being corrected while Johnson, with as little moral authority on this subject as on any other, remains in office. Under him, his party would seem an outlier on extreme misogyny and sexual harassment if it weren’t so redolent of standards recently prevailing in the Metropolitan police. It will be in his nature, as with #partygate, to blame underlings, to attempt piety, to aim his mini-terrors of the earth at men who think identically about younger female colleagues. Women should demand, instead, the kind of cultural transformation now being proposed by Sir Stephen House, Cressida Dick’s acting successor at the Metropolitan police. “There is a significant campaign within the organisation to deal with this completely unacceptable behaviour, to root it out and to exit those people who are exhibiting that behaviour from the organisation as fast as possible and in the right way.” But Dick, who’d never even called women “totty”, had to exit first.

5/1/2022,"Mark Kermode (film critic) and Simon Mayo (audio host) appear simultaneously on video link in appropriately themed rooms. Mayo’s is his spare bedroom, which boasts some excellent wallpaper featuring graphic versions of 7in singles. “Every single record label and band and identifying mark has been removed,” he notes. “But if you’re a veteran like I am, you can spot a Fontana single or a CPS or Epic…” Kermode is in a teeny room in a house he moved into only yesterday. Unsurprisingly, his is not a fabulous backdrop (unpacked boxes and what looks like a bunk bed) but somehow, he’s managed to make his computer camera reveal him in moody black and white. “Oh God, how did I do that? I can’t switch it off now,” he says. “Very Bait,” comments Mayo, dryly. Teasing and bickering with a film (and, often, music) theme is what Kermode and Mayo do, and have done since the 1990s, when Kermode first appeared in a film review slot on Mayo’s Radio 1 morning show. When Mayo decamped, first to 5 Live and then to Radio 2, their on-air relationship continued as Kermode and Mayo’s Film Review, a two-hour 5 Live Friday afternoon radio show and podcast. Even after Mayo’s rather tetchy 2018 departure from Radio 2 (he was put into a difficult co-hosting position with Jo Whiley; he left after six months), Kermode and Mayo’s Film Review remained exactly where it was, providing informed, jolly, “what to go and see this weekend” entertainment. Or “wittertainment”, as the show’s fans have it. And there are many, many fans. (We received hundreds of questions for this feature.) One of the BBC’s first ever podcasts, Kermode and Mayo… has long been one of its most popular. It won Listeners’ Choice at the British podcast awards in 2017 and 2018, and has avid, communicative listeners as well as an impressive interviewee list of high-profile directors and actors, many of whom have returned to the show several times. All respond to the wit, honesty and knowledge of the hosts. Mayo does the celebrity interviews (excellent: light but informed); Kermode provides the critical opinions (likewise, but more passionate: they occasionally turn into rants). No prying into famous people’s personal lives: the chat is entirely work-based, though this often morphs into running jokes, about cinema etiquette, or Jason Isaacs, or anything else film-esque they alight on for a time. The key to the show is: both men love film and they get on with each other. Kermode and Mayo’s Film Review seemed utterly embedded, part of the BBC’s fixtures and fittings, until March this year, when the pair announced their departure. Perhaps it was always coming, given the way that Mayo had been treated. “We both had a very nice email from the director general, thanking us for our service, and how much he’d enjoyed the programme, and I’m in the process of working out what to say in reply, which is basically, ‘Thanks very much,’” Mayo says, diplomatically. So they’ve left, and have taken a few weeks off, and when they return, on Friday, it will be in podcast form, as Kermode & Mayo’s Take. This will come out twice a week, and there’ll also be a spin-off show, Take 2, for paying subscribers (which sounds like more of the same, but with no celebs and more listener contributions). So what can we expect from these new podcasts? “Well, you catch us in the interregnum between the BBC and the glorious new future,” says Mayo, “and we haven’t actually done anything yet. It’s hard to say too much, other than, essentially, although there will be exciting differences, it’s Mark and me talking about films, and talking to actors and directors, and reading emails. We only have one way of operating.” The big difference appears to be that they will be reviewing TV shows as well as films, but, insists Kermode, this isn’t a major new feature. “To be clear, I’m a film critic who’ll happen to be watching some television,” he says. “Neither of us are pretending to step on the very great shoes of the people who review TV professionally.” The Sex and the City 2 rant goes viral “You’re not going to get a rant about this,” said Kermode, plunging into a 10-minute tirade against the “ghastly and putrid and vomit-inducing” sequel. After banging his fist on the table and singing the Internationale, he declared the film “consumerist pornography – an orgy of dripping wealth that made me sick”. Mark wakes someone from a coma In 2010, another Kermode rant, about Ron Howard’s adaptation of Angels & Demons – “stupid in ways you could not possibly imagine” – had an unexpected consequence. An email from a listener revealed that her friend Andrew, in a coma following a cardiac arrest, was brought back to consciousness after listening to Kermode’s exasperated review. The Wittertainment code of conduct In response to reports of cinema audiences behaving badly, a set of etiquette rules was drawn up for listeners to abide by. No talking. No slurping. No hobbies (including knitting, drug dealing and model aeroplane assembly). And, memorably: “No eating of anything harder than a soft roll with no filling”. Tom Hanks shares his wisdom A regular and reassuring presence on the show, whether discussing Toy Story 4 or his love for Aston Villa, Hanks provided some much-needed solace in early 2020 by sharing his favourite phrase: “This, too, shall pass. You having a rotten day? You having a great day? This, too, shall pass. It evens out.” Naomi Watts storms off During a 2013 interview about the Diana biopic she was starring in, Watts took exception to something Mayo said and brought the conversation to an untimely end. “I think we’re getting the wind-up, sorry,” she said, ending the call. Listening back to it, Simon was “a little bit baffled as to why she was so uncomfortable”. Kathryn Bromwich “Ten years ago,” says Mayo, “there was cinema and there was television. And now, there’s so much cross-fertilisation that the TV shows will be obvious, I think. The ones that our audience would hope that we will tackle. Not, say, a new EastEnders story.” If they’d been on recently, they would have discussed The Thief, His Wife and the Canoe, or Ron Howard’s documentary about Paradise in California. They’ll definitely be all over Danny Boyle’s Sex Pistols series: “Clearly he’s a fascinating guest and the Sex Pistols are a fascinating subject,” says Mayo. “And it means I can sing Danny Boyle to the tune of Danny Boy,” says Kermode. It does seem that, despite the podcasts being a new venture, much will stay the same. Kermode, naturally more passionate, will still be effusing and dismissing; Mayo, more acerbic, but also more reasonable, will continue to present more mainstream opinion. Plus they’re bringing their 5 Live production team with them, and they’ll record together, in the same room, which they much prefer to Zooming, as they did during lockdown. “It lasted for about a year,” says Kermode. “And the minute we got back in the studio together, it was so much easier. The way you talk to each other is completely different. So much of the communication is to do with me looking at him and him not looking at me…” Of course, they have other jobs: Mayo’s radio hosting sees him on air six days a week, for Scala and Greatest Hits Radio; Kermode writes reviews for this paper and talks film for various outlets. But you get the sense that being together, discussing movies every week, is an anchor for them. Or maybe a seesaw – a toy that doesn’t work without the other being there. “It’s true,” says Kermode. “Wherever we are, whatever we’re doing, we’ll be two old blokes in a room talking, with some films in between.” Who are your favourite three female directors, each? Mark Kermode: Current female directors? Carol Morley, because her films are brilliantly adventurous. I’ve had so much pleasure watching her films, and marvelling at all the many things that are going on. I’ve watched Out of Blue three times back to back, and every time I watched it I saw new things in it. My favourite female director currently working is Céline Sciamma. Girlhood was so brilliant, and not only did she have those great performances and that great milieu that you believed in, but the film landed at exactly the right moment when everyone was going: “Oh, wow, it’s raising all these issues.” And I love Petite Maman, my favourite film of last year, just perfect. Then Julia Ducournau, because I thought Raw, followed by Titane was… Simon Mayo: She has sex with a car, Mark. Come on… MK: When I saw Raw, I remember finishing my review saying: “The world is her oyster, watch her swallow it whole.” And then Titane came along, and it was like, boom. That rush of excitement and energy, you can feel her getting her fingernails dirty. I’d also add Joanna Hogg. I love her films. SM: She didn’t have sex in a car, she had sex with a car… I would add Kathryn Bigelow. What Mark says, plus Kathryn Bigelow. How did you meet and what were your first impressions of each other?Hazel, Dublin SM: I had just moved off breakfast to do mornings on Radio 1. And Matthew Bannister had taken over as controller, and I remember saying to him: “I think film reviews would be a good part of the show.” He said: “Well, Mark’s doing this for Mark and Lard. Why don’t you try him out?” So we had a rehearsal and it all went splendidly. When it comes to first impressions, I just thought it was a very good five minutes of radio. MK: I remember going: “That’s Simon Mayo off Top of the Pops!” Your show is an island of joy in increasingly dark times. I know that both of you are avid consumers of news and politics, so how do you manage to find ways to project optimism? SM: I’ve never heard us described as an island of joy before! Speaking for myself, I’d say there’s an element of performance in most radio. And it is a pretty dark time, but you don’t want an entertainment show to make you feel even worse. Which is not to say that we don’t deal with some very serious topics, either ones that come out of the movies’ subject material, or the stuff people write to us about, which is births, marriages, deaths, the final words that their father said to them before he died. But I think we have an obligation to give people an entertaining couple of hours. MK: The genius thing about the show is, I talk to Simon, and Simon talks to the audience. The joy and the optimism, that all comes from Simon. I don’t really understand how it works. I just say the first thing that comes into my head. A lot of the time they have to birdsong it. Are you continuing the birdsong in the new show?SM: I think the editorial line will stay the same as it has always been. Cursing will get birdsong. The political bias from the Trot over the way, that will get birdsong. It is, and it will always be, a programme that you can listen to with your kids and with your grandpa. What is your respective home-viewing setup?Ephraim Muller, via Twitter MK: I’ve got a fairly big flat television with a soundbar with a subwoofer. SM: More or less the same, but I haven’t got a soundbar or a subwoofer. What about your sofas? Because that’s important. MK: I sit on an armchair, because there is an armchair, and I don’t know how this happened, but it became Dad’s armchair. Even if I’m in on my own, and there is a lovely sofa that I could enjoy, I’m in the armchair. The dog’s allowed on the sofa, but I’m not. SM: I’m in the armchair, but mine is a chair without arms. It has a supportive cushion. Which are the films on which you have passionately disagreed? MK: I can answer this. When I left Radio 1, at my leaving do, I did a screening of Dougal and the Blue Cat, one of my favourite films of all time. Mayo came along, and you have never seen somebody hate a film so much. We’ve also disagreed about two films that he has never seen, and that he will never see, which is The Exorcist, which Simon won’t see because it’s my favourite film of all time, and he thinks it gets funnier every year that he won’t see it. And Jeremy, the film that I first fell in love with, because he once heard the theme tune and thought it was terrible, and therefore on principle won’t watch it. SM: I’m very happy to see The Exorcist, but it seems to be more useful as a running joke… The film that absolutely fell right into this is the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie, which I enjoyed and Mark hated. And for about a year, it was a running joke that we’d ask every guest: “Did you like Pirates of the Caribbean?” Most people liked it. MK: I’d like to point out, the people who thought they liked it, didn’t like it. They just thought they liked it until I explained to them why they didn’t. And therein is the role of a critic. SM: No, that’s the role of a Marxist. MK: I’m not a Marxist. I’m a bleeding heart, middle-class liberal. What would be your Mastermind specialist subjects if you couldn’t choose film or music?Mike Searle, Surrey MK: I want to say absolutely solidly, that I would never do Mastermind. Stuart Maconie did Mastermind, and he was brilliant. Not just amazing general knowledge, but amazing general knowledge available to him in the moment. If I said: “OK, my specialist subject will be Elvis, or The Exorcist,” and they asked me who wrote The Exorcist, or what was Elvis’s middle name, I’d blank. I would be unable to remember my own name. SM: I have refused to be on Mastermind for the same reasons. But in the spirit of the question, I would choose either Edmund Burke’s Theory of Revolution, which is what I did at university, or the War of 1812, which I studied a lot when I wrote a book a couple of years ago. What is the formula for a great movie? MK: So I would say, as a critic – and bear in mind critics do not know how to make films, they only know how to watch them – the only thing that works is the thing that I didn’t see coming. I go to screenings on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday every week, and it’s like, 10 o’clock, one o’clock, three o’clock starts. I don’t know anything about the films I’m seeing, because I tend not to read stuff in advance. Sometimes I don’t even know the name of the film. I turn up, and I have no idea what it is, then it turns out to be film of the week. Because it surprises you. SM: My honest starting point is, there is no formula. Obviously, it helps if there’s a great script, and your actors can act. But that’s sometimes not enough. So I don’t know what the answer is, and I suspect that a lot of directors might say the same. MK: Can I add one thing to this, which is: I would always rather watch a film aim high and fail on its own terms, than succeed in some botched way. Maybe, if there is a formula, it’s that. It’s why films like Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, which crashed and burned when it opened, is now considered to be Lynch’s best work, because it is what it is. Which actor do you think has produced the greatest quality of work across their career?Ben Hoeksma, Windsor MK: Kate Dickie. She is the most consistently brilliant actor I can think of. I’ve seen her in every manner of film, and I have never, ever seen her give less than 100%. When you look at her filmography, it’s astonishing. I think Kate Dickie’s screen career is the thing that you could hold up in front of movie actors and go: “That is doing the job properly.” And yet you can watch three Kate Dickie films in succession on the same day and not realise you’re watching the same person. She is the very definition of the thing that in America they call “character actors”. And here we call “actors”. SM: I remember interviewing Pete Postlethwaite a few years ago, and looking at his filmography, which was just astonishing. He was in everything, he was in almost every film that came out in one particular year. And two people who have appeared on the show a lot: Eddie Marsan, first. If Eddie is in it, whether the film is great or not, he is going to be great. And Toby Jones. In terms of a body of work, both of those you would go, extraordinary. MK: Eddie Marsan told me that the day after he finished Happy-Go-Lucky he went to America to do Hancock. Literally one minute he was going “Enraha!” in the street with Mike Leigh [from a much-quoted scene of Marsan playing an angry driving instructor], the next day he was trying to kill Will Smith with a rocket launcher. I am passionate to the point of being evangelical about the benefits of seeing films on the big screen. How do you feel about the big-screen experience today? And what’s your best experience of seeing a film with an audience? MK: I feel very positive about the big-screen experience. Even if something is available for somebody to watch on their television, a good number of people will still go and watch it in a cinema. Look at the number of people that went to see that Russell Crowe-in-a-truck film, because, “Hey, cinemas are open and Russell Crowe’s in a truck!” As for the best experience of seeing things with an audience, when we saw Gaspar Noé’s Irréversible at the Edinburgh film festival, the guy in front of me fainted and I had to carry him out of the auditorium. I was so thrilled! And somebody fainted when one of the Chapman brothers and I did a screening of Possession, the Andrzej Żuławski film. And then, of course, a very good friend of mine fainted when I saw The Exorcist at the Barnet Odeon in the 80s. You just want to be in some darkened room with people passing out.MK: With people being so overwhelmed by the film, that they literally leave their body. SM: I have no desire to see those films. But I entirely agree about the big-screen experience. There are some movies that you just have to see in the cinema, like a new James Bond. The answer to the second part is seeing One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest at Warwick University film society, in a science lecture theatre. Like being in a Methodist chapel: hard surfaces, no confectionery, no alcohol consumed. But at the end of the movie, not only did it get applause from everybody, some people stood up and applauded. Can Mark tell his Harvey Keitel story?Luke, Stockport MK: OK, so the Harvey Keitel story doesn’t exist. It was just nothing that became something through repetition. I said at one point: “Oh, it’s so libellous that you couldn’t possibly repeat it, but if you stop me in the street, I’ll tell it to you.” And then people did stop me in the street. And then I said: “OK, there isn’t a story. But if somebody asks you, tell them ‘I couldn’t possibly repeat it.’” It does cut to something at the heart of the show, which is, we always struggle to remember where the running jokes came from. Which film would world leaders most benefit from seeing and learning the messages from?Leigh, China MK: Mary Poppins, because it’s a good film about goodness. SM: Well, if Putin is in the audience, The Great Dictator would be a good place to start, and then we could all turn around and look at him and go: “That’s you.” SM: And then when he was emotionally vulnerable, play A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, which is about goodness and cardigans. Rather than being topless on a horse. If you were a biscuit, what sort would you be and why?Lady_Geoffery, Bristol SM: I would like to think that I’m a chocolate digestive, but I suspect I’m just a digestive. Sort of reassuringly wholesome. MK: I’m a ginger snap. Because they’re familiar, but they break in an unpleasant way. It’s not possible you’ve collaborated this long and never had a dream about each other. So what’s the best dream you’ve had about the other? SM: I don’t think I’ve had one. MK: I don’t think I’ve ever had a dream about you, and now I’m actually feeling guilty about that. But if Carol wants to make a film about the dreams we have about each other, I’d happily watch it. I read Simon’s book Knife Edge, and I thought it would make a good movie. Who would Simon cast in the lead role of Famie Madden? Who would Mark have direct it?Jonny Cole, New Forest SM: It was just a person who I was imagining when I wrote it, but the answer is Gemma Arterton. Although Famie is slightly older than Gemma. I would definitely cast her. MK: For director, I’d say somebody like Aneil Karia, because I remember when The Long Goodbye came out and Simon said: “You have to see this thing, it’s just amazing.” And then they just won an Oscar, which got lost in all the nonsense. SM: Actually, Aneil was slated to direct Mad Blood Stirring [another Mayo book], and then he wrote to me explaining why he couldn’t do it… If it ends up anywhere, it will be television, the rights have been bought. Which film changed your life? MK: Krakatoa, East of Java. It was the film that I remember seeing first in the cinema. My mother took me. And though I remember very little about it other than a massive volcano, and a song-and-dance number on a boat, honestly, that was the thing that made me think I want to spend the rest of my life in the cinema. I was absolutely overwhelmed. I only ever saw it once. I’d like to put Clio in my list of my favourite female film-makers too, incidentally. SM: In terms of that rocket fuel moment Mark is talking about... seeing Mary Poppins, the first movie I saw in a cinema when I was, like, six. We got the timings wrong, so I saw the second half first, and then we stayed, because it was on a continuous loop, so I saw the first half after that, out of sync. In terms of change: movies don’t change your life. MK: They do. SM: They don’t. MK: They do. Mark, do you think that in your relative old age, you’re becoming slightly softer and more forgiving of bad films? Or do you feel there’s always a chance of another Entourage rant around the corner?Graham Hollingsworth, London MK: Nobody ever believes this, but I never, ever plan to rant about anything. Quite often, afterwards, I feel a bit… ugh, you know? I think I’ve become more open-minded about what a film is trying to do, and more admiring of somebody trying to do something interesting. And less tolerant of films that aren’t even trying. A rant can always come. SM: And the films that you’re talking about are always films that aren’t bad, they are offensive. The last time I interviewed Daniel Craig, the first thing he said was: “That Entourage review went well, then?” It was already like two years old or something. He said he was on a set and everyone gathered around and watched it, because it was a great piece of performance. In fact, Mark’s performance in the review of Entourage… MK: …was better than any of the performances in the film, boom tish. Who are your top five people that you’ve interviewed on your 5 Live show? MK: Simon does the interviews, so shoot. SM: Asif is always a fantastic guest, by the way. He manages to engage you. If you’re not interested in football, you’ll still watch his Maradona doc... Off the top of my head, Tom Hanks. There is nobody who can sell a movie like Tom Hanks. Nobody. There should be a documentary made and shown to lesser actors. “This is how you do promotion. Make the person you’re talking to feel as though they’re the only person that you’re going to talk to, and give a little bit more than they’re expecting.” One time I was interviewing him, and I said to him: “What are you working on next?” And he said: “Well, it’s funny, the other day I was on the phone to Clint Eastwood…” and then he did a Clint Eastwood impression to round off the interview. So I would put Tom Hanks at one, two and three. Then the previously mentioned Sir Kenneth Branagh has to be in there, because he came in, live on the show… MK: And chuckled. SM: Which is where Chuckles comes from, a nickname that he only has when he’s on our show. He has the Hanksian gift. Whatever the merits of what he’s talking about, you just feel genial towards him. So I’m going to go Tom Hanks one, two and three, Ken Branagh four, and Chadwick Boseman at number five. The last time we spoke to him was for 21 Bridges. And he gave an astonishing answer to a question about Martin Scorsese, who was perceived as being slightly rude about Marvel films. It was like a soliloquy, an extraordinary speech about believing in what he did, and believing in the uniqueness of Marvel and Black Panther specifically. It was so wonderful that when he died, we played that answer again as a tribute. I’m aware there are no women in that answer. MK: Amma Asante would be in that list. I hadn’t met Amma when you interviewed her for Belle, and I sat there thinking: “This is the smartest film-maker I’ve ever heard.” Answers that were thought out and engaged, in beautifully formed whole sentences, with that incredible, almost broadcaster voice that she has. SM: So let’s kick out one of the Hanks. MK: And then at number five, Charlie Kaufman. …is our next questioner, weirdly, and she asks: Which film character would each of you say most typifies the other? SM: I’d cast him in the Nick Lowe story in the title role. MK: Well, you’d be A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, wouldn’t you? You’d be Hanks doing Mr Rogers. You’d be him. You’d be the guy who’d go: “Hello, everybody.” SM: I’ve got a cardigan, look. But Simon has an anger underneath there… MK: Well, there’s an absolutely great scene in that film, in which Mr Rogers is angry about something, something has got under his skin, and you just see him take a moment. A tiny little gesture that speaks volumes. And the character was a brilliant broadcaster and Simon is a brilliant broadcaster. What’s the closest you’ve come to a proper falling out?Gerald Browne, Wetherby MK: The worst that’s ever happened would be that you’ll say: “I need to do this on Wednesday.” I go: “OK, that’s going to be very complicated. Can we not do it on Tuesday?” Then some very polite text messages about which day it would be better to record a show on. When we go into that polite mode, that’s as bad as it gets. SM: I think it comes down to having very clearly defined roles on the programme. So in matters of films, I defer to Mark, because he’s the critic. I’m the host, so I can give you a proper answer about who’s been a good guest to interview on the show. There’s no jostling for the limelight. You have been very professional and diplomatic in what you have not said about the BBC, but from your lengthy experience working for the corporation, what one change would you make to sustain it for the future?Nick Taylor, Culcheth, Warrington SM: [Sighs, looks at the ceiling] We’re just presenters, I don’t know. The BBC gets enough advice. MK: I’m still at the BBC, I’m still doing Screenshot on Radio 4 and I’m still doing the News Channel film review, and there’s an outside possibility that there’ll be another Secrets of Cinema. The only thing that I would say is, trust programme-makers a little bit more. In my experience, people who make programmes actually tend to know what they’re doing, and why they’re doing it. And they thrive with as little interference from on high as possible. SM: I would say probably the BBC has to do less, and to do the things that it does, better. Staff programmes properly. Don’t make them scrimp and save and get them to work all the hours God sends just because the budget has been cut again. And that will mean there’ll be some areas that the BBC has to decide not to do. If I was still on 5 Live, and the director general had come on, I always had this question in mind: “How many orchestras does the BBC need?” What’s the worst truly bad film that you love? And what’s the best truly great film you hate? MK: Oh, wow. There are loads of bad films that I love. I would say probably the worst, truly bad in every version I’ve seen, is Caligula. Because I still have it in my head that somewhere in the ether, there is a version of Caligula that makes sense, and isn’t just an absolute car crash. I love Malcolm McDowell in that film, his portrayal of Caligula is brilliant. The scenes with him and Helen Mirren are just… So, Caligula. SM: The bad movie I really like is Patch Adams. And the entire reason for that is it’s the only time I got to interview Robin Williams. And the apparently great film I don’t like is definitely The Piano, which everyone tells me is sensational and is just rain in New Zealand. MK: I’d say the film I hate that other people love is Lars von Trier’s The Idiots. I got thrown out of the screening at Cannes for heckling it. I shouted: “Il est merde! Il est le plus merde dans le monde entier,” which is apparently not grammatically correct. I’ve actually loved other Von Trier stuff, Antichrist, and Melancholia. And I’ve interviewed him, and I said: “I have to tell you, I hated Breaking the Waves, and I hated The Idiots.” And he said: “OK, but did you really hate them?” And I said: “Yes, I really hated them. And he said: “But did you really hate them?” I said: “Yes, I really hated them.” And he said: “Good. Then we can get on.” Simon – favourite ever Spurs player? Mark – favourite bass player?Chris Moody, via Twitter SM: Osvaldo Ardiles. Going back to a time when footballers from abroad were very exciting, when Ricardo Villa and Osvaldo Ardiles from Argentina came to Spurs, it was front page of the Daily Mirror and their headline was Spurs Coup the World. It’s the kind of thing you remember. He was this wizard, brilliant genius in the midfield. MK: My favourite bassist is Jim Lea from Slade, because he was the first time I was aware of hearing the bass carrying the tune. He is an incredibly melodic bass player. One of my favourite rock films is Slade in Flame, which has got How Does It Feel as the theme tune. And the bass line just breaks my heart every time I hear it. SM: If I’m allowed a vote, I’d like to chip in with Jean-Jacques Burnel from the Stranglers. MK: Well then, I’m going to do my favourite Spurs player, which was Pat Jennings. SM: Good call. Biggest hands in football. Please explain the “With, And, But” game. Will it now be consigned to history? SM: OK, well, the “With, And, But” game is Mark Strong’s idea. So that’s rich coming from him. It was [actor]Tom Wilkinson who explained that you get your agent to ask for the “and” at the end of a list of actors in a film, so that it’s “Big Star, Big Star, and Respected Star”. But it was Mark Strong’s belief that sometimes these actors should have a “but” before their name. MK: It’s amazing how well it works. And, of course, now there are different “ands”: “with the special appearance of”, “including the involvement of”… SM: To be honest, we haven’t done it for ages. But like all of these things, it will come around again, particularly as Mark thought of it, and we love Mark Strong. Do you ever fear that thinking so deeply about films actually detracts from the basic emotional experience of watching them?Jazmin Saville, London MK: No. The idea that if you unpack something… there’s a lovely quote from Billy Bragg, out of Must I Paint You a Picture? I’m slightly misquoting it. “The temptation/ To take the precious things we have apart/ To see how they work/ Must be resisted for they never fit together again.” It’s a lovely idea that if you take something apart you can’t put it back together again, but I’ve actually never found that with a film. SM: Overanalysing people or a relationship, that can be done, but a physical thing like a book or a film… MK: Everyone knows how much I obsess about The Exorcist. I spent decades taking that film apart to see how it works. I know how every single shot of that film was created. I can tell you the day on which every single shot was created. I can tell you who was in the room when it was created. And then you play it, and it just works. It doesn’t make any difference. Will everything be all right in the end?Hannah Young, London MK: Yes. SM: OK, so this is from the line: “Will everything be all right in the end?” followed by “Yes, if it’s not all right, it’s not the end.” That line turned up again recently, in The Split. We established on the show, after exhaustive research, it comes from Best Marigold, doesn’t it, Mark? MK: It has many sources, but what we turned out to be quoting was Best Marigold, yes. SM: This taps right back into Jason Isaac’s question about being an island of positivity. Because there is no doubt that when Mark said that line in the show for the first time, it really, really struck a chord with a lot of people. And when we mentioned it to Tom Hanks, Tom Hanks absolutely loved it… Of course, when you take it out and analyse it as a statement, it doesn’t really hold any water. MK: But as a mission statement, it’s a good one. SM: I’ll go along with it as a mission statement.

5/1/2022,"An overwhelming majority of people in the UK hold the “woke” belief that it is important to be alive to issues of race and social justice, according to a new analysis of public attitudes. Four in five Britons believe in being attentive to those issues – the definition of “woke” used by the Merriam-Webster dictionary – leading researchers to claim the country is not as divided by culture wars as is often assumed. An overwhelming majority of Conservative voters and those who backed Brexit also said it was important to be attentive to the issues. The report by the Global Future thinktank, using polling by YouGov, states that it is one of several areas in which there is more agreement in the UK than polarisation. It points to strong support for taking in more Ukrainian refugees (43%), including among Tory voters (30%), as well as support for wider restrictions on immigration. Only a tiny proportion of Remainers said they want totally open borders. When asked directly whether they thought they were “woke”, with no definition given, 16% said they were, 41% said they were not and 31% said they did not know what the term meant. Asked about their views on British history, 77% of people believe Britain has been a force for good in the world but that this does not equate to denying issues about the past. Some 67% also accept that Britain has done damage. A majority believe this across age, gender and region. While 74% of Conservatives acknowledge that damage has been done in Britain’s past, 65% of Labour voters accept that Britain has also had a positive impact in the world. The findings have been supported by political figures attempting to stop political polarisation. “This research reveals the decent, tolerant and ethical centre ground of the British people,” said Jon Cruddas, the Labour MP. “We’re proud of our history and we care deeply about racial and social injustice. Despite talk of polarisation, we still share a meaningful sense of the common good.” Jesse Norman, the Tory MP and former Treasury minister, said: “What this research highlights is that, as a whole, people across the UK are both capable and comfortable in talking about complex questions of race and identity, and that they still hold firm to a centre ground of tolerance, decency and mutual respect.” The research was based on a YouGov poll conducted on 6-7 April. It polled 2,244 people online.",News/Society,Four in five people in the UK believe in being ‘woke’ to race and social justice,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/01/four-in-five-people-in-the-uk-believe-in-being-woke-to-race-and-social-justice
5/1/2022,"Reflecting on the depressing economic prospects facing this country and many parts of the world, I am reminded of a line in PG Wodehouse’s Much Obliged, Jeeves. The narrator – that Boris Johnson-like figure Bertie Wooster – sinks back in his chair, face buried in hands. “It is always my policy to look on the bright side,” he says, “but in order to do this you have to have a bright side to look on …” Well, in my view, the result of last weekend’s French presidential election offers a peep of a bright side. The concerns about the rise of the extreme right have been well aired, and there has been plenty of commentary about the fractured nature of the French polity and the mountain of problems confronting a re-elected Emmanuel Macron, who, it is to be hoped, has learned the lessons of his past mistakes. But to read a lot of the commentary, a visitor from outer space could be forgiven for concluding that Macron had actually lost the election, instead of winning by a greater margin than had been predicted. As Francisco, one of the sentinels, says in the opening scene of Hamlet: “For this relief much thanks.” Although Madame Le Pen had softened her anti-European stance for electoral reasons, there was much at stake. After Brexit, there had been a great deal of speculation about Frexit. And although the idea of France, a founding and pivotal member, leaving the EU had been formally dropped, it was obvious that Le Pen’s programme would have come pretty close to leaving the EU in all but name. As more and more citizens of this country are realising, leaving the EU is not such a great idea. In common with other economies, this country is experiencing the inevitable and damaging losses to national – and therefore individual – income from a sharp deterioration in what economists call the terms of trade. This is the ratio of export to import prices, which is reflecting the sharp increase in the cost of imported energy, grain and other essentials as a result of the invasion of Ukraine. On top of this we have Brexit; the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe calculates that the trade barriers we have imposed upon ourselves through the folly of leaving the EU have directly raised food prices in this country by 6%. Meanwhile, thanks to the arduous task of coping with all the red tape resulting from Brexit, the London School of Economics’ Centre for Economic Performance finds that trading relationships between UK and EU companies have declined by a third since the introduction of the EU-UK trade deal in January 2021. This largely reflects the blows to small- and medium-sized firms, which are supposed to be the lifeblood of the entrepreneurial economy to which this benighted government is supposed to aspire. Moreover, having seen the difference between the promise and reality of Brexit, the public seems to be having a serious rethink. The campaign group European Movement UK has recently conducted a poll which suggests, in the words of its chair, Lord Adonis, that 98% “do not want to leave the EU in its entirety”. The phrase “in its entirety” obviously leaves all sorts of scope for argument. There has been much discussion among those who were Remainers about what sort of relationship can be developed with our former partners. But do we really have to go back to the 1950s, when alternative relationships were experimented with as substitutes until it became obvious that the only sensible thing was to apply to join properly? I was surprised to find my colleague, the estimable Rafael Behr, dismissing those who wish to rejoin the EU as “only a fanatical minority”. I can tell him that in my experience there is a growing number of these “fanatics” around, and they hardly constitute a minority. And I was especially struck by the remark of the novelist Julian Barnes, when in a recent interview he described himself firmly as a “Rejoiner”, not a Remainer. Back to President Macron. He thinks Brexit is crazy and would surely be in favour of acknowledging the UK’s historic mistake and inviting us back. The Ukraine crisis assuredly underlines the importance of his vision of a stronger and more united Europe. It would help if the Tory party came to its senses, ejected Johnson and did not replace him with another Brexiter – or at least chose a former Brexiter who had seen the error of his or her ways. In Guys and Dolls, the ensemble sings: “But the passengers they knew right from wrong/For the people all said” – to Nicely-Nicely Johnson – “Sit down, sit down, you’re rocking the boat.” In the case of the Johnson we have suffered for far too long, it is surely time to throw him overboard.",News/Business,France turned its back on the far right.

5/1/2022,"For generations, any talk of “the change”, as it was euphemistically dubbed, was strictly taboo. Millions of women suffering brain fog, sleeplessness and mood swings were forced to soldier on in the face of unsympathetic bosses and partners – while cast as the butt of demeaning jokes. Worse, this state of affairs was compounded by medical sexism. Lack of training for doctors typically meant women presenting with menopausal symptoms were given short shrift or misdiagnosed. All this came at a huge cost to women’s physical and mental health. Thankfully, in recent years there has been a cultural shift. Women talk openly about the menopause – TV programmes, books, online forums and podcasts have busted the taboo – and campaign groups and politicians push hard for much-needed changes. A Channel 4 documentary presented by Davina McCall last year aimed to break down the stigma associated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which replaces the oestrogen lost by the body during the perimenopause and menopause, and dispel myths about its safety. It led to a sharp rise in the number of people requesting HRT to relieve many of the worst symptoms. In the past five years, demand for HRT has doubled. There were 238,000 prescriptions issued in England in January 2017, compared with almost 538,000 in December 2021. Around one million women in Britain take HRT, administered via gels, patches or pills. Now those women face a new challenge. Supply has not kept up with demand. There are shortages of several of the 70 HRT products available in the UK, exacerbated by global supply chain problems. One brand, Oestrogel, is nearly impossible to get. Tens of thousands of women are affected. Women reportedly meet in car parks to buy or share medicines and travel hundreds of miles on pharmacy crawls. Others ration their doses, resort to the private sector and procure supplies from abroad. Many are experiencing the return of debilitating symptoms, including night sweats, heart palpitations, hot flushes, anxiety attacks, low mood, joint pains, loss of libido and even suicidal thoughts. Every woman’s experience of menopause is different and symptoms can vary at different times. While some manage without medication, others find symptoms wreck their lives. Studies report 14m working days a year are lost to the UK economy as a result of menopause, with one woman in four having considered leaving her job. On Friday, the government said it had appointed Madelaine McTernan to lead an HRT taskforce to identify the cause of the shortages. While we welcome the move and hope this will solve long-term supply issues, action should have been taken much sooner. Shortages are not new or unexpected. Demand has been steadily increasing for some time, while shortfalls of products have been a problem for years. Many women need their HRT now, not in two or three months’ time. An alternative is available but most women can’t get hold of it thanks to a postcode lottery. Bijuve, made by Theramex, is in ample supply, but only women in Somerset and Norfolk can access it due to delays in signing off new medicines at local NHS level. Campaigners are calling for a national formulary – or list – of approved HRT treatments, available in warehouses, to ensure women everywhere have equal access. A simple change to the law on prescribing could also ease the crisis. Pharmacists must currently dispense the exact product and amount of medication on the prescription. Those in England are urging the health secretary, Sajid Javid, to let them make minor changes to a prescription without consulting the GP who wrote it so that they give a suitable alternative when something is out of stock. The “Davina effect” is expected to strike again after her follow-up documentary tomorrow. The government must be prepared.",Opinion/Opinion,The Observer view on how to solve the postcode lottery of HRT drugs | Observer editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/01/the-observer-view-on-how-to-solve-the-postcode-lottery-of-hrt-drugs
5/1/2022,"The actor Olivia Wilde was discussing a forthcoming film on stage this week when she received a mysterious envelope, passed across the stage by someone in the front row. The contents, according to various reports, were custody papers from her ex-fiance, Jason Sudeikis, with whom she has two kids. Wilde reportedly didn’t bat an eye after opening the papers, marked “personal and confidential”, but the incident sparked questions. How did the person who served the papers get into the event at CinemaCon, a star-studded film industry gathering in Las Vegas? And why did the person choose such a public moment to hand the documents to Wilde? Sudeikis, star of Apple TV+’s hit show Ted Lasso, did not know the papers would be served in such a way, a representative told Deadline. “Mr Sudeikis had no prior knowledge of the time or place that the envelope would have been delivered as this would solely be up to the process service company involved and he would never condone her being served in such an inappropriate manner,” the spokesperson said. But “this isn’t the first time that anything like this has happened”, says Ken Hastings, president of Hastings Legal Services in Temecula, California. Indeed, there is precedent for such public incidents, gleefully tracked by the celebrity gossip outlet TMZ. In 2013, for instance, an audience member apparently served legal papers to the musician Ciara while she was performing. A few years later, Tyga was hosting a sneaker release party when someone approached him to have him sign a few boxes – then handed him some papers and posed for a picture. Britney Spears was given documents while leaving a medical facility, according to video on the site. And last year, Dr Dre was apparently served divorce papers immediately after attending his grandmother’s funeral. David Glass, another California attorney, told People about serving the baseball player Steve Garvey a few decades back. “He was hiding, he was always staying inside. And we found out that he was going to be speaking at this seminar. And so my boss at the time had our process server buy a ticket, went into the event and basically the same thing that they did here, walked up on stage and gave it to them. I wouldn’t have approved it, but that’s what my boss did.” Whether what happened to Wilde was appropriate would depend, in Hastings’ opinion, on whether serving the papers onstage was a last resort – for example, if the person appeared to be “evading service”. Speaking to NPR, a Las Vegas-area process server took a similar view. “I have never come across a client or been involved in a serve where this would be the first thing we do,” Bill Falkner said. It was the most public incident he was aware of, he said. Service of process is the formal name for the procedure in which a recipient is given papers to launch the legal process. In celebrity-rich states including California and New York, the rules are fairly broad. Most adults can deliver the papers, as long as they’re not parties to the case – so, in theory, you could have your best friend do it. In California, papers can be served “​​at the party’s home, work, or anywhere on the street”. Is the recipient refusing to take the documents? Never fear: “They can be left on the ground in front of him or her. If he or she takes the papers and tears them up or throws them away, service is still considered to be valid,” according to the state’s judicial branch. But you might prefer to hire a professional, known as a process server. For one thing, it removes some of the legal headaches involved, says Hastings. A friend has to prove to a court that they have served the papers, whereas if a process server does the job, it’s up to the recipient to prove they weren’t served, he says, though the rules governing the whole process vary by state. What’s more, process servers have expertise in tracking people down. “We do skip traces. We do stakeouts. We do many things that private investigators do,” Hastings says. So is it like in the movies, where people use all kinds of schemes to chase people? “The movies get it wrong where, you know, we dress up in different uniforms to try to do things,” Hastings says. But going to great lengths isn’t unusual – for instance, early in his career, Hastings used a parking garage to “surveil a condo in downtown LA, to make sure that the subject we were looking for was in the condo. So we got eye level with that unit,” and then had to find a way into the building, he says. Once you reach the target, “you have to identify the person, the general nature of the documents, and have proximity to that person”, Hastings says. That means that – at least in California, home of Hollywood – you might not hear the familiar refrain from the movies: “You’ve been served.”",Arts/Film,Olivia Wilde was served papers onstage.
