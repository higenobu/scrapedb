12/12/2021,"Jazz of the past filtered through 21st-century ears: that’s the nearest I can get to explaining what makes Kansas Smitty’s music unique. The band, under its American leader Giacomo Smith, has always managed to bring it off with that mixture of seriousness and levity that goes down well with British audiences. Now, apart from the bass player and Smith himself, it’s a new band and a new set of ears, attuned to hip-hop. For them Smith has devised a set of pieces based on samples taken from works by Jelly Roll Morton, Bix Beiderbecke and others – including Maurice Ravel! With some, such as opening track High Society, the samples are so obscure that there’s no apparent connection with the original, which seems rather pointless. Others, for instance Morton’s New Orleans Bump, work beautifully. This has a real character of its own, more subdued and mysterious than the original. I’d say the balance between these two extremes is about 50/50. I hope the band aren’t turning all arty on us. But Water Dance (from Ravel’s Jeux d’Eau) makes a great job of the tricklings and splashings.

12/12/2021,"As I write, Tesla, the manufacturer of electric vehicles (EVs), has a market capitalisation of $1.051tn, which makes it the world’s sixth most valuable company by market cap. Tesla shares are trading at $1,047, which is 64% higher than at this time last year. Elon Musk, the founder and CEO of the company, currently has a net worth estimated at $300bn, which makes him the richest person in the world. Enormous wealth, like power, acts as an aphrodisiac that warps people’s perceptions of those who possess it: it’s as if they’re surrounded by a reality distortion field. Similar force fields have enveloped Bill Gates and Steve Jobs in their time and now it’s Musk’s turn. Because he’s uncommonly voluble on social media, especially on Twitter, where he has 65.7 million followers, his every utterance is assiduously parsed by besotted fans (all of whom call him “Elon”, as if he were a buddy of theirs). This gives him an influence way beyond that of any other corporate executive, influence that, on some occasions, even affects global financial markets through what the normally sober Financial Times calls the “Tesla-financial complex”. A closer examination of his Twitter feed, though, yields an impression of a really complex individual: a baffling combination of formidable intelligence and ungovernability – part visionary, part genius, part fruitcake and part exploiter of tax loopholes and public subsidies. And it raises the question: what (or where) is the real Elon Musk?  The answer, I suspect, lies in his mastery of the business of manufacturing complex products. One sees it, for example, in the way SpaceX, the aerospace company he set up to reduce the colossal costs of space travel, has become the first non-state organisation to: successfully launch, orbit and recover a spacecraft; send a spacecraft to the International Space Station; manage the first vertical takeoff and vertical landing for an orbital rocket; and send astronauts to the International Space Station. Anyone who thinks this stuff is easy has never done it. Compared to SpaceX, you’d have thought that the business of manufacturing electric cars would be child’s play, especially since, compared to vehicles powered by internal combustion engines, they’re considerably simpler. (Basically, an EV is like a massive skateboard where the huge battery is the board.) Even so, when Tesla started making them in 2008, the world (not to mention Ford, General Motors, BMW, Mercedes, VW and Toyota) sniggered, which, oddly enough, reminded this columnist of the way Nokia and Motorola sniggered in 2007 at the idea of Apple making a mobile phone. The story is the same in the case of the car. Tesla did eventually figure out how to make them – making bodyshells out of aluminium and then kitting them out with all the stuff that goes into a vehicle using a combination of robots and humans – and now its Model 3 is emerging as the bestselling new car in a number of markets. But it turns out that, just as with Apple and the smartphone, mastering the art of conventional manufacturing was just the beginning. Some time ago, Musk seemed to have had an epiphany, perhaps triggered by a conversation with a grizzled veteran of car manufacturing named Sandy Munro, who allegedly likened the rear end of a Tesla shell during manufacture to a patchwork quilt. Why, Musk mused, couldn’t the entire bodyshell be die-cast in one piece from molten aluminium, just as reproduction toy cars are? You can guess where this is heading. Tesla bought a number of colossal press-casting machines – inevitably christened “Giga Presses” – from Idra, the Italian company that makes them. And they are now deployed in some Tesla factories turning out the rear half of Model Y bodyshells as single pressure-moulded pieces. Suddenly, a task that required 70 different parts to be assembled by 300 robots is being done by a single giant machine. The obvious next step is to use the same process to make the complete bodyshell in one fell swoop. This step – and the huge investment needed to implement it – suggests a new way of thinking about Musk: as the spiritual heir of Henry Ford. Since the early days of the car, there have only been three major paradigm shifts in the manufacturing process. The first was Ford’s introduction of a moving production line, memorably satirised in Charlie Chaplin’s Modern Times, which could turn out a completed Model T in 90 minutes. The second paradigm shift came from Toyota in the postwar years – the famous “lean” production method that involved minimising inventories and arranging supply chains for just-in-time delivery of components that arrived just before they were needed at the relevant stage in the manufacturing process. Although invented in Japan, and initially ignored by the US car industry, in the end every car has been made the Toyota way. Lastly, the arrival of the Giga Press and the thinking behind it is what suggests that, in the end, Musk might be remembered not so much as the oddball who dreamed of colonising Mars (or possibly expired thereon), but as the guy who found a new way of making terrestrial vehicles. He will doubtless be frustrated by this thought, but – hey! – that’s a price the rest of us might be prepared to bear.

12/12/2021,"Anya Chalotra is watching me. I have half-threatened to order a Venezuelan sandwich from the chalkboard at the London café we’re in – we are talking just after lunch – but I don’t trust myself to maintain a serious line of questioning and not get guacamole down my front while doing it. “Are you sure? I don’t mind,” she says. No it’s fine, Anya, please. Later, the café owner tours the tables to tell us they are closing in 20 minutes. “And what about your sandwich?” Anya points to me. Honestly, please, I had a flapjack, it was hearty. And after the interview: “Do you want to stay and have your sandwich now?” I mean I would, but they are closed, so it’s too late now, isn’t it? Lunch aside, the point is that Anya Chalotra is a gifted and enthusiastic people-watcher. She confesses to this up front: “I’m obsessed with people,” she says, not not sounding like a serial killer, “and I’m obsessed with analysing people.” But it bulges out of every anecdote she gives, too. On being recognised in public: “Oh, I’m always stuffing my face. They always come up to me when I’m stuffing my face. Because I don’t mind going to the pub on my own, or eating on my own – I just sit in the corner and watch people – but they always get me stuffing my face.” On pandemic activities: “I was just staring into space, mainly.” On filming in multiple difficult climates as her character in Netflix series The Witcher traversed magically across continents: “The whole crew was in the sea, jeans rolled up, or wearing trunks. And I don’t know how I wasn’t cracking up, looking at all these people in their jazzy little trunks. It was quite a serious moment.” On east London parks, an objective ranking thereof: “Victoria Park. Always. The dog-watching there is hilarious. I just find their mothers’ meetings, in the park, hysterical.”  Watching, watching, watching. Which is what 76 million people did when the first series of The Witcher dropped in December 2019. This is partly because The Witcher was so much better than it had any business being: classically, television based on video game source material (it is, before anyone starts, also a book) has been hard to get right. But also, while other fantasy shows have tried to establish layer upon layer of lore they hope Redditors will squabble over forever, The Witcher pivoted, telling an overarching story of Henry Cavill’s Geralt of Rivia meeting his epic love-match in Chalotra’s Yennefer of Vengerberg, but set against a backdrop of an X Files-style monster-of-the-week format. Essentially, despite having magic and witches and m’lords, it was fun, erring towards the pesky mischief of old folklore rather than the trudging macguffinery of modern fantasy. Chalotra’s Yennefer became crucial to the show’s success because, over the course of the timeline-bending first season, it was her character who appeared in so many iterations. When we first meet her, she has a curved spine (Chalotra wore a prosthetic hump for weeks on end: “We burned it,” she says, in actually quite a scary way) and a misaligned jaw, and is sold to a witch for half the price of a pig. But from there she grows into power, is unleashed as a dark adviser to various kings and is soon strutting around the continent, double-crossing lords, feuding, having sex so effectively the tower she’s in explodes, and the whole thing ends in a battle that gets “quite spicy” and ends up with most of the world in front of her being on fire. We see her grown up, youthful, nervous and powerful, which is a lot of parts to play for an actor relatively fresh out of drama school. Chalotra did her foundation course at Lamda and a subsequent three-year degree at Guildhall, but she cut her teeth “performing for attention” by being born as the middle child in a family of three to a traditional-ish family in Lower Penn, Staffordshire. She performed in that classic childhood way all kids do: rouge on the cheeks, wearing adults’ shoes. “Oh God, my brother. I found a clip the other day where I’d dressed him up as Gareth Gates, because I was obsessed with him from Pop Idol. And another one – he was Peter Pan, my cousin was Wendy, and I have no idea who I was, but I was in a costume and I was bossing them about.” She was smart-but-not-in-that-super-academic-way at school. “I was annoying, more than anything. I remember, like, having to sit on my own… quite a bit.” But it was only when she was accepted by Lamda after an audition at 18 that she started thinking of herself as someone who could do acting as a career. “I had to get into a drama school,” she says, “because in my family – I’m very heavily influenced by my Indian culture – my dad typically wanted me to be a doctor or a dentist or a pharmacist or a journalist or… Anything that was more academic than, you know, prancing about in costume for a living. So that was what I focused on throughout that whole process: treating it like exams.” The initial foundation course at Lamda was a full-throttle year of shows, rehearsals, pretending to be a tree – classic drama school fare – before she was catapulted up towards Guildhall. “That’s why I think it’s more interesting to take people who are a little bit older into drama school,” she explains, “because they’ve had that experience of university and they’ve lived and they’ve gotten some work on their own terms for a while, before they enter a world which, I wouldn’t say you have to ‘know yourself’, but it would be nice to know what I liked and disliked a little bit more before I went. I hadn’t properly developed my opinion on things and it’s probably only in lockdown that I really feel like I’ve grown in that way. I really feel like through lockdown I just developed a taste for things because I’ve had time. I never had time to watch the amount that I do now.” It’s interesting to think of someone going through the dual whirlwinds of back-to-back drama schools and then being cast in one of the most-watched TV shows the world’s biggest streamer ever made sitting down and actually becoming a person, but that’s what Chalotra, now 26, spent the last year doing, thanks mostly to pandemic lockdowns stopping all known whirlwinds in their tracks. “What do I like now? Hmm. Well it’s a really obvious answer [this is not an obvious answer, by the way], Danish film. Thomas Vinterberg. That’s what I’m really into, right now. I like the writing, I like the space, I like the colour grade.” A lockdown interest for photography was going well until The Canal Incident. “My recent camera… well, I kicked it in a canal, basically.” Why? “A bike bell dinged. I’d been crouched down taking some pictures of flies on the surface of the water – beautiful – and I thought I’d put it in my bag. But then I kicked it and it just… dropped.” It’s a harrowing story, actually, to hear Chalotra tell it. “It was like slow motion. I could hear the soundtrack in my head and then the music stopped. I called my brother – he has the same camera – and was like, ‘You’ll never guess what happened: the camera, the grand camera, has just gone in the bloody canal’. I didn’t go in there because… I just saw it sink to the bottom. There were bubbles. So now I’m just on my iPhone and a disposable, until I can earn myself a new one.” I’m intrigued about how someone who so fanatically watches dogs, flies, trunk-wearers and sandwich avoiders deals with suddenly being the one who is watched. Obviously, actors are used to being perceived – before The Witcher, Chalotra appeared in another Netflix show, Wanderlust, and in the John Malkovitch-as-Poirot series, The ABC Murders (there was a very modern non-kerfuffle, about her character singing Somewhere Over the Rainbow – a song released in 1939 – in a series set in 1933), as well as receiving critical praise for her turn as Jyoti in the Theatre Royal Stratford East’s production of The Village. But there’s a difference between being described as “compelling” in a four-star Guardian review and going from 400 to 914,000 Instagram followers almost overnight. Was that weird? “Oh, I never wanted a blue tick in my life,” she says, airily, and it’s one of the first times I’ve ever heard someone say that where I’ve actually believed them. “I was on, like, MSN and Facebook so late. Like, so late. And I think it’s because I have such a huge family – I have about 35 first cousins – so I come from a big family, and I’ve always been quite content with that world.” Did she have to archive any embarrassing old selfies when the dumptruck of fame rolled around? “Never a selfie taker. Was never a selfie taker. But what I had to hide was, well, family photos. They don’t need to be part of that at the moment.” She’s still fairly offline – “I choose to go on when I have a nice collection of photos to post” – so busies herself away from the hum of social media with photography, cooking (“I cook so much. I love cooking my meals – it’s a great joy”), sitting in the corners of pubs darkly watching people go about their lives and kicking expensive electronics into bodies of water. After Chalotra’s photoshoot, as I got in everyone’s way and annoyed the photographers who were just trying to pack up and leave, I asked them what they thought of Chalotra while we waited for her to emerge from the dressing room in civilian clothes (in a very timely four or five minutes – there is no “this actress was really late” gossip to be had here, sorry). ‘Very hard-working,” they said, and humoured me with, “a perfectionist. And loves her clothes.” Do you love your clothes, I ask her? A moment of pondering. “I do. I love love love fashion. But I’m very specific. In terms of buying, I like charity shops and secondhand designer pieces – I’m into that. Because then you get the quality without such a huge investment.” She starts talking with the frantic excitement I recognise from a fellow eBay-head, and I ask her the best thing she’s ever got from the auction site, which is apparently the most serious and difficult question I’ve asked all afternoon. “Oh God that’s hard,” she says. “Probably a chair? A lovely chair. That’s my best eBay get. Ooh, but I can tell you my dad’s: a 99p printer. My dad went to collect it and said, ‘Keep the change.’ ” Another actual question spurred by a photographer trying to get me out of the way of some cables: is she a perfectionist? Is she a better actress in this series than she was in the last one as a result? Chalotra rues, a little, going into The Witcher with only a couple of smaller experiences of working on screen, but recognises her performance came off as green to pretty much none of the 76m viewers apart from her. “I don’t want to undermine other people’s enjoyment of it, but when I watched season one I was cringing at most parts,” she says, “but it doesn’t mean I wasn’t so proud of the work that I’d done. I criticised every part of it and felt that I didn’t believe enough about my work, but I put so much work into it, so I can really appreciate when I watched it, like, the emotional attachments in each scene and what I had to go through to deliver that.” After a leave-it-all-on-the-floor approach to last season – there was screaming, destruction, rebirth, nudity – season two’s Yennefer is a more stable, fully formed character, and gives Chalotra a chance to build on the good work of two years ago without exactly returning to the well of it. “I suppose because I exposed so much of myself in season one – it was actually fulfilling, because it just means I have done everything now – I really have shown so much of myself to the world, and being a perfectionist I’m like: well, I’ve done that bit now. I’ve done the ‘learning in public’. Am I better now? I dunno.

12/12/2021,"The speed at which scientists worked to develop the first Covid jabs was unprecedented. Just nine months after the UK went into lockdown, 90-year-old Margaret Keenan officially became the first person in the world outside a trial to receive the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. But the virus is mutating, and the emergence of the Omicron variant last month is already focusing attention on the next generation of jabs. So what do we know about the new Covid-19 vaccines? One change is with delivery mechanisms, such as San Francisco firm Vaxart’s vaccine-in-a-pill, and Scancell’s spring-powered injectors that pierce the skin without a needle. But the biggest development is in T-cell technology. Produced by the bone marrow, T-cells are white blood cells that form a key part of the immune system. While current vaccines mainly generate antibodies that stick to the virus and stop it infecting the body, the new vaccines prime T-cells to find and destroy infected cells, thus preventing viral replication and disease. (The current vaccines also produce a T-cell response, but to a lesser extent.)  After a recent study published in Nature, scientists said vaccines targeting a T-cell response could produce much longer-lasting immunity, and be better at fighting virus mutations. “The first-generation Covid-19 vaccines were a rapid and massive victory – far greater than we dared predict,” said Danny Altmann, a professor of immunology at Imperial College London. “But they’re only the first generation of quick wins, which is how they should be regarded. Moving forward there are challenges to consider.” Here are some of the companies on the cutting edge of development: Last week, Canada’s Medicago and UK-based GlaxoSmithKline announced “positive efficacy and safety results” from a global trial for what they say is the world’s first plant-based vaccine. It is based on a relative of the tobacco plant, used to produce a particle that mimics the virus, and is combined with an adjuvant made by GSK, which boosts general immune response. The late-stage trial, which involved 24,000 adults across six countries, showed the jab had an overall efficacy rate of 71%, rising to 75% against the Delta variant. The study did not include the new Omicron variant. Medicago, majority-owned by Japan’s Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings since 2013 while Philip Morris International holds a one-third stake, is filing for regulatory approval in Canada and is also in talks with US and UK regulators. The World Health Organization has described plant-derived vaccines as “a new and exciting possibility”, cheap to produce and easy to store. The Nasdaq-listed biotech firm has developed what it says is the world’s first oral Covid vaccine, which elicits a T-cell response and generates some antibodies in the nose. The firm dosed its first patients in a mid-stage clinical trial in October. It is also testing if the tablet works against Omicron. A larger international trial with 800 participants will follow next year. Full data from the US trial is expected by March. The tablets can be stored without refrigeration, which makes them easier to use around the world and overcomes the problem of needle phobia. “If you give a pill and a glass of water, you can go a lot faster,” says Dr Sean Tucker, who founded Vaxart 17 years ago. “The mucosa is where the virus invades, and if we stop it there, we keep people healthier and fight off this virus and its variants.” The spinout from the University of Nottingham, now based in Oxford, is testing two vaccine candidates that induce antibody and T-cell responses against the original and variant Sars-CoV-2 viruses in 40 healthy volunteers in South Africa. The first patient was dosed in October and Scancell will conduct a further trial in the UK, with the first data from the early-stage clinical trials expected by June. The vaccines have been developed with Nottingham’s two universities, with £2m of funding from Innovate UK, and are based on a modification of Scancell’s DNA vaccine technology. They are given via needle-free, spring-powered injectors that use a narrow stream of fluid to penetrate the skin. Founded in 1997 by Lindy Durrant, professor of cancer immunotherapy at Nottingham University and the firm’s chief executive, Scancell specialises in developing cancer vaccines. It listed in London in 2008. Its two main shareholders are the US health investor Redmile and the Singapore Vulpes Life Science Fund, while Durrant and other management together own 1.8% of the company. The Oxfordshire company has developed a T-cell vaccine that will eventually take the form of an easy-to-administer skin patch. It has recruited 26 people for its first human trial in January. The product can last for up to three months at room temperature. Emergex, founded in 2016 by Thomas Rademacher, emeritus professor of molecular medicine at University College London to develop T-cell vaccines is owned by Singaporean venture capital firm Vickers Venture Partners, its management and high-net worth individuals and family offices. The University of Plymouth spinout, which is part-owned by intellectual property specialist Frontier IP, has developed a herpes-virus-based vaccine that has been shown in animal studies to work against both Covid and Sars. It stimulates a strong T-cell response, would be effective against other variants and could boost other vaccines, says Jeremy Salt, the chief executive, a trained vet who has worked for Pfizer in vaccine development. The group is looking for a commercial partner that can produce the vaccine at scale for human trials next year. It will be given as an injection or as a nasal spray.",News/Business,"As Covid mutates, the vaccine makers are adapting too",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/11/as-covid-mutates-the-vaccine-makers-are-adapting-too

12/12/2021,"The agate type will show that Magnus Carlsen retained the world championship he’s held for eight years by defeating Russia’s Ian Nepomniachtchi for a fourth time in six games on Friday, closing out their best-of-14 encounter by a score of 7½-3½ and bolstering his claim as the greatest player of this or any other era. But the Norwegian’s fifth world title match victory – one short of the suddenly imperilled all-time record of six – was freighted with additional meaning by striking a decisive win for a sport that has been dogged by existential questions over its own relevance in an age of supercomputers said to have made the world’s best players too good to fail.  The familiar hand-wringing was impossible to ignore in the early stages of the €2m showdown between Carlsen and Nepomniachtchi that unfolded over the past two weeks in Dubai. Not only did they play to five straight bloodless results to open the proceedings – extending a record streak of 19 draws in classical world championship games extending back to Carlsen’s final two with Sergey Karjakin in 2016 and all 12 against Fabiano Caruana in 2018 – but engines evaluating the moves indicated it was to that point the most accurate title match in the event’s 135-year history. For years observers have bemoaned the recession of humanity of a sport that has increasingly – and never more than in the generation since Deep Blue v Kasparov, 1997 – become informed by the machinelike objectivity of the supercomputer. Once again a parade of draws borne from near-perfect chess was threatening to overshadow the sport’s biggest spectacle, prompting renewed calls to revamp the format, including shorter time controls that might induce the world’s best players into the types of mistakes that make decisive results possible. All of that went silent with game six, a heart-pounding psychodrama worthy of the sprawling canvas only the classical format can provide: two world-class players going toe to toe over eight gruelling hours within the lonely confines of a sound-proof glass box. Nepomniachtchi went from having Carlsen on the ropes under clock pressure at the first time control, to coming within five seconds of losing on time himself, to finding himself squeezed toward submission in a positional endgame by a relentless foe operating with engine-like precision as Friday turned to Saturday until finally giving in with an inaccuracy on the 130th move. When the Russian resigned after midnight and the curtain dropped on the longest game ever played in a world title match, the playing hall erupted in applause. It was a contest of extreme cognitive, emotional and physical intensity – and Carlsen admitted that dragging his opponent into deep waters, making it a test of endurance and stamina as much as skill, was in his plan. “Part of it was by design at some point,” he said. “I thought I should make the game as long as possible so that we would both be as tired as possible when the critical moment came. That turned out to be a good strategy.” For Carlsen, who turned 31 last week and is regarded as no worse than the third best player in history with Kasparov and Fischer, it was a legacy-defining affair: perhaps the one game from thousands that will be invoked when his career is finished as emblematic of what made him different. Carlsen’s preternatural ability to spot harmony where others see chaos, to build pressure over time, to hold nerve and never give, to take every infinitesimal advantage given and grind out wins from seemingly dull positions that appear bound for draws – to squeeze blood from a stone – has been the Norwegian’s calling card from when he first came to prominence in the early aughts as a fresh-faced, precocious teenager breathlessly touted as the “Mozart of chess”. To accomplish it in his competitive prime on the biggest stage of all, in one of the rare moments every few years when this cloistered sport asks the public to lean forward and pay attention, elevated it from simply a memorable game to one of the greatest ever played. “There’s only one player in the world against whom Ian would have lost this game today,” said Viswanathan Anand, the former champion turned commentator who ceded his title to Carlsen in 2013. “Unfortunately for him, that player was sitting opposite. Because as late as move one hundred and something, Ian still had the draw. But this guy just wouldn’t stop and that’s the reason he won.” Further, game six embodied a triumph for a classical format dismissed as hidebound and obsolete by laying bare a human frailty that no amount of backroom technological advances can fully subsume. Grandmasters, like prizefighters, are avatars for wills. And the weeklong unravelling that ensued once Nepomniachtchi’s was shattered, while frankly difficult to watch, offered heightened gladiatorial drama no less panoramic and compelling than a five-set war of attrition at Wimbledon or the rare championship boxing match that ennobles both men while taking something out of one he may never get back. The careless blunder that cost him in the eighth game was unbecoming of a player ranked in the world’s top five, which he is. The even more elementary gaffe that donated Carlsen the ninth, extinguishing his already threadbare comeback hopes, was among the most egregious in the annals of world championship matchplay. As Carlsen had said only days before: “Pressure gets to everybody.” The flailing challenger, bruised by self-doubt and unable to even pinpoint how exactly it had gone wrong, punctuated his self-destruction with yet another extraordinary pawn blunder in Friday’s 11th game, gifting Carlsen the match. The margin of four wins and no defeats is the most lopsided result in a world championship since Capablanca’s triumph over Lasker exactly 100 years ago. Carlsen will now keep the title for another year and a half before he is required to defend it in early 2023. The eight-man candidates tournament to determine his next challenger happens next summer. Nepomniachtchi will be there, though many believe Carlsen’s stiffest test could come from Alireza Firouzja, the teenage prodigy ranked second who punched his ticket after winning last month’s Grand Swiss in Riga. For today, though, the winner is chess itself, which endures into tomorrow as it has for centuries, arresting imaginations across all cultures with the unceasing promise of infinite potential: all of it within those 64 tiny squares that contain more possible games than atoms in the observable universe. If there’s anything the past fortnight has shown – from the dizzying heights of Carlsen’s epochal game six win to the unpleasant denouement of his foil that followed – it’s that maybe there’s something still intrinsically human in this after all.",Sport/Sport,Carlsen’s epochal world title triumph proves an antidote to perfection | Bryan Armen Graham,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/dec/11/magnus-carlsen-epochal-chess-world-title-triumph-proves-an-antidote-to-perfection
