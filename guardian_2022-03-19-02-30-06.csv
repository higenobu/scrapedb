3/19/2022,"In 1977 Liz (Elizabeth) Shore, who has died aged 94, became deputy chief medical officer (DCMO). She held this post, one of the highest positions in medicine, for eight years. In 1984, Shore would have been appointed to the top job – chief medical officer – as she was the strongest candidate, but the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, vetoed the appointment, suspicious of Shore’s Labour connections. (Her husband, Peter, was in the shadow cabinet.) In the 1970s the medical career structure was pyramid-shaped, with junior doctors working more than 70 hours a week and competing for a tiny number of consultant posts. This career path in particular did not suit women with children, who were leaving in droves; one study found that 40% of female medical graduates were leaving the profession. Shore herself had struggled to find suitable work as a GP while bringing up her four children and knew only too well how opportunities could be few and far between. So she seized her chance as DCMO to make the medical career structure more female-friendly. To practise as a doctor there are costs such as insurance and journal subscriptions. Shore persuaded regional health authorities that if a doctor worked just one session a week (half a day), the authority should pick up the bill for these costs. This made it much more worthwhile for women to stay working part-time. Shore was also part of discussions between the then Department of Health and Social Security and various doctors’ committees that resulted in a white paper recommending changing the ratio of senior to junior doctors and creating 100 additional consultant posts over two years. This, and other changes to doctors’ grades and working hours, was the start of a sea change making the career structure more flexible, with increased opportunities to become a consultant. The role of the chief medical officers is to advise health ministers and they are a crucial source of continuity, particularly when there is a fast ministerial turnover. Shore started as a DCMO at a particularly difficult time, in the aftermath of the Labour health minister Barbara Castle’s attempt to end private beds in NHS hospitals, the British Medical Association having retaliated with industrial action. Shore was adept at negotiation and bringing people together. She had a funny, self-deprecating manner that was disarming but she was also pragmatic and could be forceful if required. In her Who’s Who entry, she listed her hobby as “swimming in rough seas”, which those who knew her thought might have referred as much to Whitehall as to the Cornish Atlantic. As DCMO, Shore’s portfolio included health inequalities. In 1978 she led the UK delegation at the World Health Organization conference in Alma-Ata, USSR (now Almaty, Kazakhstan). One of the milestones in 20th-century public health, this conference got 134 countries to agree to key principles and commit to funding and strengthening primary healthcare. Shore served on the inquiry, chaired by Douglas Black, into health inequality in the UK, which recommended measures such as improving housing and increasing child benefit. She urged the slow-moving committee to produce an interim report and key findings in time for the May 1979 election, and was disappointed when the incoming Conservative health minister Patrick Jenkin decided to bury the report by publishing it on the August bank holiday and rejected its findings. By 1985 Shore was disenchanted with serving successive Conservative ministers. (If Thatcher visited the department’s offices, Shore was known to hide in the ladies’ lavatory.) She left the civil service, becoming dean of postgraduate medicine at the North West Thames Regional Health Authority. There and as president of the Medical Women’s Federation in 1990-92 she continued to champion women’s progression in medicine. In 1980 she was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath for services to medicine. Liz was born in Oxford, the youngest of seven children. Her Canadian father, Edward Wrong, was a history don and vice-principal of Magdalen College, Oxford, and her mother, Rosalind (nee Smith), was also a historian. Six months after Liz was born, Edward died and Rosalind had to make drastic changes. The youngest three children were shipped off to stay with their grandfather in Toronto, whose household Elizabeth found austere and cheerless. When Liz was 10, her mother was back on her feet and managed to get the children home to live with her in Oxford. Liz attended Oxford high school and Cheltenham ladies’ college before winning a scholarship to read natural sciences at Newnham College, Cambridge. There she met Peter Shore, a fellow student, at a May Day party and they married in 1948. Liz trained in medicine at St Bartholomew’s hospital in London, one of only five women in a class of 60. She spent her 20s and 30s bringing up her children and working as a GP in and around London and in Harlow, Essex. She said she had no idea that the civil service employed doctors, but, restless with her role in family planning and community health, aged 35 she answered an advertisement to join the Ministry of Health and never looked back. Peter became MP for Stepney in east London in 1964. He was part of the Labour leader Harold Wilson’s “kitchen cabinet” of close friends and colleagues, and later became a peer as Lord Shore of Stepney. Liz supported him throughout his career but, at the same time, as a high-ranking civil servant, tried to be discreet about her political views. Their home in Putney, west London, was a busy hub, with both political colleagues and extended family often coming over for dinner, and Liz liked to switch off from work and immerse herself in domesticity, baking cakes and hosting dinner parties. After Peter’s death in 2001, Liz, who by now was retired, decided to decamp to St Ives in Cornwall, where for many years they had surfed and enjoyed holidays. She took an Open University degree and, well into her 80s, swam in the sea every day and joined the coastguard watch. She had spent the past couple of years in a care home. Her son Piers died in 1977. She is survived by her daughters, Thomasina and Tacy, and son Crispin, nine grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.  Liz (Elizabeth) Catherine Shore, doctor and civil servant, born 19 August 1927; died 20 February 2022",News/Society,Dr Liz Shore obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/18/dr-liz-shore-obituary
3/19/2022,"There are some British films which are basically the convenience-store sandwich of big-screen entertainment. Cinema’s equivalent of the 24-hour-garage tuna mayo pitta bread. And that, sadly, is the case with The Nan Movie, a truly horrendous and depressing film about Catherine Tate’s sweary old-lady character from her sketch show, in a storyline stretched out to a brutal hour and a half. It arrives in UK cinemas with no fanfare and an uneasy lack of clarity about who the director is supposed to be. Some official listings give it as former Donmar Warehouse artistic director Josie Rourke and some say Tate herself, but there’s nothing on the closing credits, other than to say that both are producers. Was this how British audiences felt when they stumbled out of the cinema having watched Holiday on the Buses in 1973, or Keith Lemon: The Film in 2012? Did they also suspect that their profound depression and self-reproach were secretly shared by the film-makers themselves? The idea is that Nan (actual first name: Joanie) is still living in her London flat getting visits from her devoted grandson Jamie (Mathew Horne), a well-meaning liberal who drives a charity minibus for people suffering with anxiety and helps them do therapeutic craft activities. Or, as it says on the bus: Crafts Undo Negative Thinking, which is one of the funnier bits. Nan receives a letter from her long-estranged sister Nell (Katherine Parkinson), from the cottage where she lives on an “island off of Ireland”, who wants to see her because she is dying. Jamie offers to drive Nan there in his minibus, and their wacky road-movie adventures are interspersed with flashbacks to the war, when Joanie and Nell were two London-Irish sisters during the blitz who fell out because they both fell in love with the same man: a handsome African American GI played by Parker Sawyers (whose most prominent role before this was playing Barack Obama in a film about his first date with Michelle). Perhaps this film could have worked if it just told the 1940 part of the story – there are flashes of good material here and there. Tate is a black-belt comic and even this film can’t utterly efface that fact. But the modern-day sections with Nan accidentally going clubbing are very close to late-period Carry On, and sadder than anything by Ingmar Bergman. It really is a terrible film – emerging just as Catherine Tate is unveiling another multi-persona TV show, Hard Cell, about all the people in a women’s prison. Tate fans are hoping and expecting the best for that. But a 2027 film movie about a breakout character from Hard Cell probably won’t be a good idea.  The Nan Movie is released on 18 March in UK cinemas.",Arts/Film,The Nan Movie review – brutally unfunny outing for Catherine Tate’s sweary old lady,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/18/the-nan-movie-review-catherine-tate-as-funny-as-late-period-carry-on
3/19/2022,"To the layperson, the unceremonious sacking of 800 P&O Ferries workers may look like a consequence of Britain leaving the EU, with any legal action by the trade unions turning into the first big test of workers’ rights post-Brexit. Despite Boris Johnson’s assurances that Britain’s departure from the EU would be better for UK workers, there have been fears it would be seen by the government as an opportunity to erode workers’ rights in a bid to increase competitiveness. However, the reality is that, so far at least, there has been no derogation from EU employment rights and the scope for any backsliding is limited. Contained within the trade and cooperation agreement with the EU, there is a non-regression clause, under which Britain agreed not to reduce employment rights below the standards existing on 31 December 2020 in a manner that would affect trade or investment. The EU could take retaliatory measures such as tariffs if trade or investment were affected and could also legally challenge the regression before a panel of experts. John Bowers QC, a leading employment barrister and principal of Brasenose college, Oxford, said: “Although the government’s huffed and puffed about changing the law, so far they haven’t. The straightforward statutory redundancy law is purely UK, it’s the redundancy consultation [law] that is EU-related and we haven’t changed that. Andrea London, a partner in law firm Winckworth Sherwood’s employment team, said Brexit was a “red herring”. She said the EU Collective Redundancies Directive was implemented in the UK by a primary act of parliament which “gold-plated” (went beyond) the EU legislation, adding: “Given its longevity and trade union backing, it is firmly entrenched in the UK employment law environment, and there inevitably would be considerable opposition to any repeal or paring back of the protections in this act due to leaving the EU.” When there were reports – denied by the government – that proposals were being considered to lower employment rights, those plans did not mention redundancy rights but rather an end to the 48-hour maximum working week, changes to rules about breaks at work, and removing overtime pay when calculating certain holiday pay entitlements. Where Brexit has had an impact is in the courts, although its effect will be limited. When the UK was a member of the EU, the country’s highest appeal court could ask the European court of justice (ECJ) for an opinion on how to interpret EU law but post-Brexit it will no longer be able to do this for employment cases nor most others. However, most people bringing employment tribunals will probably be oblivious to the changes, and given that the P&O Ferries case involves rights conferred directly by UK laws it is a moot point and will not have any impact on legal action brought by trade unions against the ferry operator. Regardless, the chances of the case going to the supreme court seem remote at this stage if it is a straightforward matter legally of the company not having consulted with workers prior to the redundancies, unless there is a dispute over the jurisdiction of the employment contracts. Bowers said what had happened was not a result of Brexit but of insufficient legal protection. “The only remedy is a monetary one,” he said. “What there really should be is an injunction to stop people dismissing without consultation.”",News/Business,Are the P&O Ferries mass sackings a result of Brexit?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/18/po-ferries-sackings-brexit-uk-eu-employment-law
3/19/2022,"On Thursday afternoon the remaining staff of RT’s British operation – including the former Scottish first minister, Alec Salmond – headed to the 16th floor of Westminster’s Millbank Tower and cleared their desks for the final time. After almost a decade on air the British arm of the outlet was in the process of closing down its operations, ahead of the expected loss of its broadcasting licence. If you’ve heard about Ofcom’s decision to permanently ban the Kremlin-backed television channel RT from UK airwaves, then it’s probably because you have read coverage of the decision rather than because you were a viewer. RT’s most recent audience figures showed it was a statistical afterthought, reaching just 79,000 viewers a day – with most watching for around a minute as they flicked through channels. Yet the fate of this channel parroting the Kremlin’s line on world affairs – describing the invasion of Ukraine as a “special military operation” – has become a symbolic focus of British political debate about Russian media influence in Britain. RT’s loss of a broadcasting licence now poses two big questions: will the lack of a television channel make much difference to the Kremlin’s ability to push its message to British audiences? And will Moscow use the decision as justification to further restrict the BBC’s activities in Russia? Ofcom’s decision to rapidly revoke RT’s licence was highly unusual, with similar decisions usually taking years of legal wrangling rather than three weeks of correspondence. Even as Russian tanks rolled over the border into Ukraine, Ofcom emphasised that it was perfectly possible for a television station to present a skewed viewpoint, so long as other views were represented. Although RT had received a substantial fine for rule breaches following the 2018 Salisbury novichok poisoning, it has since had a clean record. Yet, amid intense political pressure and similar EU-wide bans, events moved fast. As early as 8 March, Ofcom informed RT that the channel’s bosses were no longer considered “fit and proper” to hold a licence. After years of being content that the station’s editorial line was not directly controlled by the Kremlin, within days Ofcom had concluded that the “exceptional” circumstances of the war in Ukraine – and the introduction of a law in Russia criminalising certain coverage of the invasion – made it impossible for RT to meet the required standards to hold a British broadcasting licence. “No other Ofcom broadcast licensee is financially dependent on a state whose head of state, President Putin, has been personally sanctioned by the UK for launching a war of aggression against a neighbouring state,” said Ofcom. Yet the decision only affects RT’s regulated television broadcasts in the UK, which were less popular than the broadcaster’s booming unregulated online output. Instead, in the long run the more important restriction on Russia’s propaganda machine may be the decision of major US tech platforms such as Facebook and YouTube to ban access to RT’s content in Britain. The real significance of Ofcom’s ruling may be in publicly delegitimising RT and associated Russian media outlets in the minds of the British public. The BBC is also waiting to see whether it will face further pushback as a result of Ofcom’s decision. It has already stopped producing its Russian-language content in Russia, although its English-language correspondents have resumed broadcasting. Although the Kremlin has spent more than a decade investing in western media outlets, its top-down approach to broadcasting has been outflanked in the current conflict by canny Ukrainian use of social media aimed at English-speaking audiences. While President Putin appears at giant television-friendly rallies, his rival, President Zelenskiy, is more adept at producing short, emotional clips that go viral on Twitter.",News/Media,Will Ofcom’s decision to ban RT stop Kremlin message reaching UK audiences?,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/18/will-ofcoms-decision-to-ban-rt-stop-kremlin-message-reaching-uk-audiences
3/19/2022,"A 223-foot (68-metre) luxury yacht owned by a former KGB agent and longtime acquaintance of Vladimir Putin is currently stranded at a Norwegian port after locals’ persistent refusal to sell it fuel. The vessel, called Ragnar, an old norse word meaning “warrior”, is owned by Vladimir Strzhalkovsky, and its crew has been told by Norwegian fuel suppliers in the northern port of Narvik to “row home” or “raise the sails”. They say they will not refuel it because of the owner’s links to the Russian president. Its captain Rob Lankester, who says he is a British former Royal Marine, has accused Norwegian authorities of discrimination, saying the yacht’s owner is not on the sanctions list and that neither he, nor his 15-man crew, is Russian. Neither he says, is the yacht Russian, as it is registered in Malta, sailing under the Maltese flag. “But no one will listen to us,” he said. Lankester added that he and his crew “just want to go home”. He has accused Norway of operating double standards as Russian fishing boats, which he said account for 20% of the economy in northern Norway, are “able to buy fuel and operate unhindered in Norwegian ports and waters”. Russia landed $150m in fish in Norway in 2021 according to publication Intrafish. Lankester told the Norwegian broadcaster NRK, which was allowed on to the yacht: “We are a western crew of 16 people on board. We have nothing to do with the owner of the boat.” In a written complaint addressed to authorities on 15 March, and seen by the Guardian, he wrote: “As a western crew we are disappointed in the double standards that certain factors of Norway have inflicted on the yacht and crew. This yacht and its ultimate beneficial owner are on no European or UK sanction list so we find the discrimination towards us extremely unjust.” Strzhalkovsky made his fortune in nickel mining as CEO of Norilsk Nickel, reportedly receiving a golden payout of $100m when he stepped down after four years a decade ago. He has served a spell as Russia’s deputy economics minister, and is currently on the board of Dynamo Moscow football club. He is not on the European Union’s list of oligarchs sanctioned as a consequence of Russia’s war on Ukraine. Norway, which is not a member of the EU, but is closely associated with it and its legal framework through its membership of the European Economic Area, is supportive of the sanctions already imposed. A Norwegian government official told the country’s media that the vessel could only be confiscated if the action was supported by an EU directive. However, locals have said the superyacht is not welcome and have taken matters into their own hands. Local leaders and members of Narvik’s business economy have urged the Norwegian authorities to seize the boat. Sven Holmlund, general manager of Holmlund oil supplies in Narvik, told NRK: “Russians’ conduct in Ukraine leaves me speechless. Why should we help them? They can row home, or raise their sails.” Halbakk Bunkers, which supplies fuel along the entire Norwegian coast and specialises in fuelling foreign ore ships which frequent the port of Narvik, has also turned down offers to help. “We are fully aware of what is happening in Ukraine,” its general manager Gunnar Grann told NRK. “Therefore we have chosen to say no to all Russian boats, including trawlers. We don’t want to get into a situation where we in any way are contributing to the Russian economy.” NRK described a tour around the luxury yacht which it said “oozes luxury and exclusive craftsmanship”. It has ice-breaking capabilities and is equipped for polar exploration. It boasts its own gym, spa, pool, helicopter pad and several sundecks as well as a garage with snowmobiles, jet skis, skiing equipment and snowboards. It was recently put up for sale for €69m and is available for rent for €40,000 a week. Lankester said it had sailed to Narvik for its guests to “engage in winter tourism”, but that a group of guests due to arrive on 13 March had “failed to turn up”.",News/World news,Russian oligarch’s yacht stuck in Norway as suppliers refuse to refuel,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/18/russian-oligarchs-yacht-stuck-in-norway-as-suppliers-refuse-to-refuel

The investigation comes after Tui was informed this week that Mordashova controls Ondero Ltd, which bought stakes in Mordashov’s Unifirm Ltd, Tui’s top shareholder, from two of his subsidiaries on 28 February. Mordashov was among Russian businessmen sanctioned by the EU that day. He has also been sanctioned by the UK. Mordashova has been named in media reports as Mordashov’s wife. According to Refinitiv data, the 34% stake in Tui owned by the Mordashov family is worth about €1.5bn (£1.3bn). Germany’s economy ministry has “initiated an investigation procedure under the foreign trade and payments act against Ondero Ltd regarding the effectiveness of the notified transaction”, Tui said on Friday. The ministry confirmed the investigation was under way, but declined further comment. A spokesperson for Russian steelmaker Severstal, in which Mordashov is the controlling shareholder, declined to comment on the matter. Tui also said it had been informed that until the conclusion of the investigation, the transaction was “pendingly invalid” and Unifirm Ltd’s voting rights could not be exercised. The travel company said earlier this month that Mordashov had informed it about changes in the ownership structure of Unifirm Ltd, under which it transferred 4.1% of its 34% Tui stake to Russia’s Severgroup, also controlled by Mordashov. At the time it was also disclosed that Mordashov’s subsidiaries KN-Holding LLC and Rayglow Ltd sold their shares held in Unifirm Ltd to Ondero Ltd on 28 February, giving Ondero a 29.9% indirect stake in Tui.

3/19/2022,"The sports bra, once a neglected piece of gym kit, has officially become a wardrobe staple for women as comfortable bras chip away at the hegemony of the underwire in the working-from-home era. In the past 12 months, the number of sports bras sold in Britain has jumped by a third to 7.1m as women swap underwired-cup oppression for stretchy elastic heaven. In sales terms, spending on sports bras jumped by a quarter to £72.3m to account for nearly 10% of total bra sales, according to retail analysts Kantar. This bra revolution has not gone unnoticed. This week statisticians revealed that sports and crop top-style bras had been added to the list of 700 products used to calculate the inflation rate. In its annual shake-up, the Office for National Statistics also revealed men were being freed of their shackles as the traditional suit – present in the basket since its inception in 1947 – was axed. The pandemic had helped to increase Britons’ awareness of fitness, with many people working out at home during lockdown periods, the ONS said. “With this has come a rise in expenditure on sports clothing,” it said. But analysts suggest women are buying sports bras with Netflix rather than Joe Wicks’ workouts in mind, as the lifestyle changes triggered by pandemic lockdowns turbocharged the catwalk-led “athleisure” trend for sportswear as fashion. “We are seeing a massive increase in demand for anything athleisure-related,” said Rebecca Watterson, a consumer insight director in Kantar’s fashion team. “So even though the [bra] market declined during the pandemic and is now flat, people are buying into sports bras.” “We saw a big uptick in people doing sport during lockdown, but the reason we are being given for buying sports bras is general daywear – so it’s more comfort-led.” Soozie Jenkinson, the head of lingerie design at Marks & Spencer, said the long-term shift away from formal to casual dressing was having an impact on the styles of underwear its customers bought even before the pandemic, as athleisure became mainstream. “When Covid-19 hit, and we were all thrown into different ways of working, it accelerated that trend and women’s approach to clothing as well as bras changed,” she said. Comfort became the “number one factor” and there was a big shift towards selling non-wired bras, crop tops and bralettes. While some women opted to buy more comfortable bras to wear at home, others wore their old ones or ditched them altogether – leading to reports of the great lingerie liberation of lockdown. In the year to 9 February 2020, women had bought 75.7m bras, spending nearly £780m, but in the first year of the pandemic stores sold 13.1m fewer bras, with nearly £140m wiped off sales, according to Kantar, which said bra sales had now almost recovered to pre-pandemic levels. The athleisure trend means that the categories of bra are “more blurred than they ever have been before” Jenkinson said, adding that the “sporty look” is holding sway even in everyday bras. “The sports bra has become quite a generic term because of the way that the fashion trends have been going over the last few years.” New hi-tech fabrics, such as M&S’s Flexifit with its promise of “4-way stretch technology”, were also altering the market as retailers were able to design more invisible and seam-free garments, she said. This new aesthetic has been given by pneumatic lift by Kim KardashianWest’s shapewear company Skims, which has struck gold with products such as the £32 “fits everybody” bralette made out of the “softest, stretchiest butter fabric”. Its sales are going gangbusters and a recent fundraising saw it valued at more than £2bn by investors. Within the lingerie market, there is an ongoing shift towards buying more comfortable non-wired bras, including crop tops and bralettes, according to market researcher Mintel, and high street retailers are keen for a piece of the action. John Lewis is selling one of its £18 seam-free Anya bras every 25 minutes, while Uniqlo’s £20 wireless bras with moulded stretchy cups are also converting underwire wearers. Tamara Sender, a senior fashion analyst at Mintel, said the popularity of sports bras was part of an evolving sports fashion trend as women wore sporty clothing styles in their everyday life as well as for exercising. The growing focus on health and wellbeing may continue to fuel demand for sports bras, according to Sender, who also detects winds of change. “We are seeing young women, who tend to be driven to buy new items as a result of fashion trends, showing a penchant for sexier styles of lingerie such as bodies and bodysuits as pent-up demand for going out and getting dressed up once again is released.” The bra is dead, long live the bra.",News/Business,How the sports bra undercut the underwire,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/18/how-the-sports-bra-under-cut-the-underwire
3/19/2022,"Andy McCluskey remembers vividly the first time he came up close and personal with a Maurice Wade painting. The Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark co-founder was at a gallery in Hale, Cheshire, enquiring about a different artwork altogether when it stopped him in his tracks. “I walked in and there it was, BOOM!” he says. “His paintings have a resonance for me on so many levels: the stark sense of black and white, the industrial landscapes, the melancholy … I just went, ‘Woooah.’” And then? “And then I got a bit carried away.” In the decade since that first encounter, McCluskey has snapped up 21 works by the little-known British painter. They currently cover pretty much all the wall space in his house (“I have no need for wallpaper”), although they’re about to leave home to appear in a new exhibition, Silent Landscapes: The Andy McCluskey Collection. It’s only the second exhibition of Wade’s work in the past 30 years and one that McCluskey hopes will bring the late oil painter some much deserved attention. “It’s difficult to find out much about him,” says McCluskey. “Nobody can even find a photograph of him. He’s quite mysterious.” What he does know is that Wade was born in 1917 in Newcastle-under-Lyme. After serving in the second world war, he returned to the Potteries to teach art before becoming a full-time painter, exhibiting at the Royal Academy and the Paris Salon. Yet, save for a handful of commissions, his 320-odd paintings were all produced within five miles of his home in Longport. And what paintings they are: towering kilns and chimneys, rows of old houses, crystal-clear reflections in the canal water, meticulously studied paint trowelled on thickly with a palette knife. “The stillness in his canals,” marvels McCluskey. “They really are the absolute pinnacle.” In a sense these paintings work as historical records of a bygone Britain – the houses on 1961’s Hot Lane, for instance, are no longer there. But McCluskey is keen to point out that Wade is not a “northern artist” in the tradition of LS Lowry: “The way he painted was, frankly, just less sentimental.” He’s hoping the noise around this exhibition may help to reveal where more of Wade’s paintings are hiding. “I am hoping people will read this article and go, ‘I think my nan’s got one like that over her mantelpiece,’” he grins, before telling a story about a framer at a gallery who thought he might have framed a couple of Wades for another Stoke native, Robbie Williams. McCluskey shares an agent with Williams so got in touch to ask. “Straight back I get an email from him going, ‘All right mate! I don’t actually own anything by Maurice Wade but why don’t I? I need to get one of these yesterday! Where can I get one?’ We’ve told him if any more come in he can have first dibs.” McCluskey grew up with painting. He describes Liverpool’s Walker Art Gallery as his “home from home” and as a teenager he would finger-paint his own swirling, psychedelic oil paintings in homage to JMW Turner (you can see a couple of these in the exhibition catalogue). “My son asked why all my paintings were done in 1974 and 1975,” he says. “That’s because on 24 June 1975, on my 16th birthday, I took all my money and bought a bass guitar: end of painting!” But McCluskey did complete his A-level art in which he got an E after writing an essay declaring all wall-hung art to be dead. (Another essay on Dada, which was written in a dadaist style, also failed to impress the teachers.) He toyed with the idea of studying fine art at Leeds, and recently realised that if he had done he would have been there at the same time as Scritti Politti’s Green Gartside, and Dave Ball and Marc Almond of Soft Cell – who knows what band may have emerged? Instead he formed OMD with his friend Paul Humphreys: McCluskey on a cheap left-handed bass played upside down, Humphreys making weird noises from machines built out of his auntie’s dismantled radios. “Everyone said it was future pop, but the only synth we had was from my mother’s catalogue,” says McCluskey. “Still, one of the things I loved about Brian Eno is that he said, ‘If you’ve only got a load of cheap junk, the chances are you’re the only people with that particular collection of cheap junk ... that’s your sound, so celebrate it.’ And so that’s what we did.” They were only ever going to play one gig (“that’s why we had such a stupid name”). And in a way they should never have been pop stars – compared to the cool customers on the Liverpool scene that formed around Eric’s club (Echo and the Bunnymen, Dead or Alive, Teardrop Explodes), McCluskey stood out with his huge afro and baggy clothes. But their music – romantic melodies aligned with icy, robotic backdrops – caught the attention of Factory records. McCluskey laughs recalling how the label’s famous designer Peter Saville took him to one side and said: “Your music sounds like the future but you look terrible ... cut your hair!” Yet this was actually the start of a great working relationship between the two men, with McCluskey describing him as the “artistic big brother I never had”. In fact, he thinks his love of Wade’s paintings might be connected to the black, thermographic design Saville produced for their debut single, Electricity, which shared not just a starkness but also a three-dimensional quality thanks to the way Wade applied his paint. Saville’s artistic influence over OMD is a great story in itself. McCluskey recalls him being so inspired by Edward Wadsworth’s 1919 vorticist painting Dazzle-ships in Drydock at Liverpool that he asked them if they could write a song and album of the same name to match his sleeve idea. “I just said, yeah,” admits McCluskey. “It was definitely the tail wagging the dog.” That album, Dazzle Ships, stands out now as OMD’s most bold and bizarre, one in which they moved away from their synth-pop roots to a more avant-garde approach that incorporated musique concrète and bursts of shortwave radio. But at the time the reception was muted. “It was almost career-ending,” says McCluskey. “Virgin Records joked at the time that it was their only record that shipped gold and returned platinum.” Nowadays it’s regarded by many fans as their masterpiece, with some comparing it to Kid A in the way it attempted to dismantle pop and rebuild it as something altogether new. The live shows around the album were just as artfully ambitious. “It was like a Russian constructivist ballet set, with bits that moved and the drums six foot in the air,” says McCluskey. “For a couple of songs the stage set played the songs. It was a complete bloody pain in the arse to be honest – but it did mess with people’s heads.” Two years ago, OMD were preparing to go on a 40th anniversary tour in the US but the pandemic put a halt on things; instead they will be fulfilling those commitments next month. Looking back on four decades of the group, does McCluskey consider them pioneers? “We do get called that and I am certainly not going to say, ‘No, we weren’t’. Nobody works in a vacuum, of course. But in the days before the internet, when it was just the press, we knew nothing of the Human League and Cabaret Voltaire. And our little hobby turned out to be on the rise and crest of a wave.” OMD’s best known song, of course, is a sprightly pop number about the atomic bomb dropping on Hiroshima. When McCluskey wrote Enola Gay, the cold war was still to thaw. “People of my generation were entirely sure that at some point someone would press the red button and we’d all go to hell,” he says. “It was just a matter of time.” How does he view the current re-emergence of a global nuclear threat? “I thought I’d never see warfare in Europe in my lifetime,” he says. “So, sadly, my fascination with warfare is still relevant. I wish it wasn’t.” It’s perhaps not too much of a stretch to wonder if the frantic pace of the modern world, with its 24/7 information overload of scandals and division, may make it a ripe time for people to fall in love with Maurice Wade. His unpeopled paintings possess a calm quite at odds with the chaotic Britain of today. “I completely agree,” says McCluskey. “If you stand in front of one of those paintings you can immerse yourself in this hushed tranquillity. In these hectic times, that’s not a bad kind of escape.” Silent Landscapes: The Andy McCluskey Collection is at Trent Art, Newcastle from 25 March until 29 April.",Arts/Culture,‘Nobody can even find a photograph of him.
