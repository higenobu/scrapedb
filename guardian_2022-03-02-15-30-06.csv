3/2/2022,"A police officer charged with the murder of an Aboriginal man has been called to give evidence in his own trial. Constable Zachary Rolfe has begun giving evidence about the events leading up to the attempted arrest of Kumanjayi Walker. He was called as the first defence witness in the Northern Territory supreme court on Wednesday after the prosecution finished its case. The court previously heard that Rolfe shot Walker three times while trying to arrest him on 9 November 2019 in the remote community of Yuendumu, about 300km from Alice Springs. Walker, a 19-year-old Warlpiri man, had stabbed Rolfe with a pair of scissors shortly before the first shot was fired. Rolfe is not charged in relation to this shot. He is charged in relation to the second and third shots fired at Walker but has pleaded not guilty, and his lawyers have argued his actions on the day were justified in light of the risk that Walker posed to him and a colleague, the then-constable Adam Eberl. Rolfe, 30, told the court that on the day of the shooting, when he was travelling from Alice Springs to Yuendumu, he recalled one comment he made in the car to a colleague from the Immediate Response Team (IRT) about the “mission”. The IRT was a semi-tactical unit staffed by general duties officers who had received additional training and was often used to contain high-risk incidents or arrest high-risk offenders, Rolfe said. Rolfe said he told constable first class James Kirstenfeldt that he believed the IRT should have “been sent out earlier”, and clarified that he meant days earlier, because of the threat posed by Walker. Rolfe had earlier told the court that he had watched body-worn camera footage on 7 November 2019 of an incident involving Walker that had occurred the previous day. During that incident, Walker used an axe to threaten two Yuendumu police officers who had been attempting to arrest him. Rolfe told the court he formed the opinion from watching the video that Walker was “extremely violent” and had the potential to use “lethal weapons” against police. He said he also felt the Yuendumu officers involved displayed “a perfect example of a human fear-based reaction” when Walker threatened them with an axe. Rolfe said he then spoke to Sgt Evan Kelly, who was his manager on the shift, about the axe incident, as he was concerned it was “being swept under the rug”. He clarified that what he meant by this was that it was the type of incident all officers in Alice Springs should be alerted to, as travel between Yuendumu and Alice Springs was common, and Walker therefore posed a threat to local police. Rolfe said Kelly agreed with this assessment. Rolfe said he also spoke with Sgt Lee Bauwens, the officer in charge of the IRT, that day. He said he informed Bauwens about the incident, and told him “I was of the mind that it was the sort of job” the IRT should be called to. He said Bauwens agreed. Rolfe said that later that day he attended a house in an area of Alice Springs known as the Warlpiri camp, looking for Walker. Rolfe said he had found information on Walker’s police file linking him to the house in Warlpiri camp, but there was no indication when police attended that anyone was inside. Rolfe said that on the day of the shooting he received a phone call about half an hour before his shift was going to start from acting Sgt Shane McCormack informing him that he was being deployed with the IRT to Yuendumu. He said he asked McCormack twice what the mission in Yuendumu was, and was told on both occasions that it was to arrest Walker. He said McCormack told him there was no intelligence about the location of Walker since the axe incident, but that it was hoped Yuendumu sergeant Julie Frost would provide them with intelligence once they arrived. Rolfe told the court he met with the other three IRT officers who were being deployed to Yuendumu at Alice Springs police station and told them about this mission, Walker’s criminal history, and that nurses in the remote community had been evacuated earlier that day because of a spate of break-ins at their sleeping quarters. He said two of the officers did not know about the axe incident, so he played them footage of that before the team all left the station about 3.30pm. Rolfe’s evidence finished on Wednesday before he was asked about the shooting. His evidence will continue on Thursday. Earlier on Wednesday, David Edwardson QC, for Rolfe, continued his cross-examination of Det Sr Sgt Andrew Barram. Edwardson asked Barram, an experienced officer who has held senior positions in NT police training and professional standards departments and wrote four reports on the shooting for the prosecution, about evidence he had given on Tuesday. Barram had said that Rolfe could have used “empty hand” techniques to restrain Walker rather than shooting him a second and third time, as Walker was under the control of Eberl at the time. The court has previously heard that the second and third shots were fired while Eberl attempted to restrain Walker on a mattress after he stabbed Rolfe. Edwardson asked Walker about a police training manual that has been extensively referenced during the trial. In a section about officers being confronted with an edged weapon, under the headline Points That May Save Your Life, it stated “do not use empty hand techniques unless it is not possible to use a firearm”. Edwardson asked Barram whether Rolfe had therefore acted consistently with his training when firing the second and third shots. Barram disagreed, saying Rolfe could have disengaged rather than shot Walker. “He could have, and if he disengaged, Constable Eberl could be dead,” Edwardson said. “No he couldn’t, no,” Barram responded. Edwardson asked what would have happened if Walker had stabbed Eberl in the carotid artery. “How was that going to happen in that position?” Barram said. Edwardson responded, in reference to previous evidence Barram had given about not being able to see the arm holding the scissors in body-worn camera footage of the incident, “oh, senior sergeant, we’ve been through that before, nothing further your honour”.

3/2/2022,"Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, has managed to do what Joe Biden could not: bridge the partisan divide and bring, however fleetingly, the US Congress together. Many Democrats and Republicans who attended the US president’s first State of the Union address, on Tuesday night, wore yellow and blue in solidarity with Ukraine, with some holding miniature Ukrainian flags. And when Biden discussed the world-shaking events of the past week – this will inevitably be remembered as his Ukraine speech, irrespective of inflation and other domestic concerns – the chamber rose as one to applaud time and again. Putin “thought he could divide us at home in this chamber and this nation”, said Biden, wearing a dark suit, white shirt and blue tie. “He thought he could divide us in Europe as well. But Putin was wrong. We are ready, we are united and that’s what we did: we stayed united.” It was not a subject that Biden expected or wanted to be talking about even a few weeks ago. The man who gives a portrait of President Franklin D Roosevelt pride of place in the Oval Office now finds himself pivoting from New Deal FDR to wartime FDR, from sweeping economic reforms to facing down an unhinged European despot. Russia’s unprovoked attack on Ukraine meant that Biden’s 62-minute speech was addressing not only the chamber on Capitol Hill and the nation but the world, even as bombs fell on Ukrainian cities. Some in Europe remain frustrated that the US has not done more to cow Putin. The president found himself cast in the role of what some still quaintly call “leader of the free world”. “We are inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine,” Biden said of withering sanctions. “Putin is now isolated from the world more than ever.” He promised to defend “every inch” of Nato territory. But Biden being Biden, infamous for his gaffes, all did not go smoothly. In a slip of the tongue, he said Putin would never gain the hearts and souls of the “Iranian” people when he meant Ukrainian. Curiously and ominously, the 79-year-old deviated from his prepared remarks to ad lib: “He has no idea what’s coming,” and finished the speech with a clenched fist and: “Go get him!” With Russia’s nuclear deterrent forces on high alert, this was no time for a repeat of President Ronald Reagan’s “We begin bombing in five minutes” quip. But Uncle Joe is stronger when it comes to bedside manner. There was a grace note of reassurance for Americans who have genuinely been discussing the possibility of a third world war. “I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming to all Americans,” he said. “But I want you to know, we’re going to be OK, we’re going to be OK. When the history of this era is written, Putin’s war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger,” said Biden to a standing ovation. Democrats and Republicans united in approval of Biden’s plan to close American airspace to all Russian flights and build a dedicated taskforce to go after the crimes of oligarchs. “We are joining with our European allies to find and seize your yachts, your luxury apartments, your private jets. We are coming for your ill-begotten gains.” They united again in a tide of emotion as Oksana Markarova, the Ukrainan ambassador to the US, stood in the public gallery, whispering “thank you” with tears in her eyes, right hand on heart, left hand clutching a mini flag. Markarova was a guest of the first lady, Jill Biden, and travelled in the presidential motorcade from the White House to Capitol Hill. For a moment it was the 20th century again, when partisan differences seemed small compared to the external, existential threat of the Soviet Union. There is nothing so unifying as a common foe. Then came a jarring gear shift. When Biden moved to the domestic area, and took a swipe at the Donald Trump administration’s tax cuts for the rich, Republicans erupted in booing. For a moment, it was almost a surprise, but then not really: the bloodsport of daily politics had resumed. So it was that later, when Biden talked about security at the US-Mexico border, two far-right Republican House members, Lauren Boebert and Marjorie Taylor Greene, shouted “Build the wall!” as if trying to conjure Trump’s ghost from the depths. A Democrat snapped: “Sit down.” And when Biden made reference to flag-draped coffins returning from Afghanistan, Boebert heckled: “You put them in, 13 of them!” – a reference to the 13 US personnel who died during the evacuation. Democrats booed loudly in response. But when Biden spoke of crime and declared: “The answer is not to defund the police,” both sides united in cheering again while Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez laughed rather than clapped and her fellow progressive Ilhan Omar sat stony-faced. The president’s Build Back Better agenda has stalled but he pushed some of its components. Likewise he warned that voting rights were “under assault”. His nemesis on both counts, the Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, sat between the Republicans Mitt Romney and Roger Wicker in an extravagant gesture of bipartisanship unlikely to charm liberals. It was another sign that the more things change, the more they stay the same in the theatre of the State of the Union. For the first time in its history, two women – Vice-President Kamala Harris and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi – sat behind the president. As members of Congress from each side cheered or jeered each punchline, five supreme court justices and military men worked hard to remain still and expressionless. Senators and representatives were physically distanced on the floor and in the public gallery but face masks were gone – a hopeful sign of time healing all. “Let’s use this moment to reset,” Biden pleaded. “Let’s stop looking at Covid-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: a God-awful disease. Let’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: fellow Americans.” Putin, not Biden, might achieve that end. The president’s approval rating is dismal and there is no guarantee this primetime address will do anything to arrest the decline. Was it a speech for the ages, with a ringing phrase that will define this moment of global peril? Perhaps not. But it will have made millions of people in America and around the world grateful that the man at the podium was not Donald Trump.",News/US news,State of the Union: a moment of unity dissolves into partisan feuding,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/01/state-of-the-union-ukraine-biden-agenda
3/2/2022,"The New South Wales division of the Liberal party is lurching towards federal intervention and a legal quagmire, just weeks before the federal election campaign. Another peace deal failed to win the 90% support required to pass state executive during a fax ballot held on Wednesday. But the proposal to parachute candidates into the remaining federal seats is said to have support from the factional leaders and will be put to the federal party on Friday as a basis for a limited intervention in the troubled NSW branch. The ballot proposed endorsing former young Liberal president, Alex Dore, as the Hughes candidate despite grassroots fury at the prospect of a candidate from outside the seat being imposed. In Dobell, cardiologist Michael Feneley would be endorsed. Conservative defence analyst Lincoln Parker has been ditched in Warringah, with factional powerbrokers opting for disability campaigner David Brady, despite the fact he had not nominated. Until recently he was a candidate for the Senate. The Liberals have little hope of winning the seat back from independent Zali Steggall but are hoping with a more moderate candidate they can claw back some of her 7.2% margin. In Parramatta, local businesswoman Maria Kovacic was chosen over Charles Camenzuli, who ran in 2019 and Hornsby councillor Felicity Findlay. Senior Liberals acknowledge that winning the seat will now be an uphill battle despite the retirement of Labor’s Julia Owens, due to the short campaigning period. Candidates have also been chosen for Greenway and Eden-Monaro.

The federal executive has the power to impose a solution to the epic stoush over NSW preselections, which has paralysed the NSW party. It also has the power to take over the NSW division by appointing an administrator. But if it does intervene, there is almost certain to be legal action from members of the state executive unhappy with the intervention and from candidates who were not given the opportunity to contest seats. That could see the party embroiled in more controversy in the leadup to the federal election that must be held by May.

Polina, primary school pupil One of the first civilian victims named in the conflict was Polina, who was in her final year of primary school in Kyiv. A photo shows her smiling, her hair highlighted with pink streaks. Kyiv’s deputy mayor, Volodymyr Bondarenko, said in a Facebook post that her family car was shot at by “Russian saboteurs” in the city. Her brother was taken for treatment at Okhmatdyt children’s hospital and her sister was last known to be in intensive care at another hospital. Unnamed six-year-old girl On 27 February a six-year-old girl was caught in shelling in the port city of Mariupol. In scenes captured by an Associated Press journalist, the girl’s wounded father, his head bloodied and bandaged, could be seen lifting his child, wearing pyjamas decorated with cartoon unicorns, into the back of an ambulance. As a medical team fought to save her, her mother wept outside. “Show this to Putin,” a medic said angrily into the journalist’s camera. “The eyes of this child, and crying doctors.” Unnamed six-year-old boy A boy was killed when a five-storey apartment building was shelled in Chuhuiv, a city outside Kharkiv. His 13-year-old brother is being treated at a children’s hospital in Kyiv, Pravda News and the BBC reported. The head of the Cherkasy regional state administration, Oleksandr Skichko, wrote about the blast on the morning of 24 February, saying on Facebook: “A shell hit the central part of the city. One civilian dead, five more in hospital.” Yelena Ivanova and Yelena Kudrin, secondary school teachers At the Kalininsky district cemetery, mourners were pictured grieving at the funeral of two teachers killed in a shelling attack on Gorlovka, in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, on 25 February.

3/2/2022,"England’s Environment Agency has downgraded 93% of prosecutions for serious pollution over four years, despite recommendations from frontline staff for the perpetrators to face the highest sanction, a leaked report seen by the Guardian reveals. Between April 2016 and December 2020, investigators within the agency gathered evidence and prepared case files on 495 serious incidents, involving the worst type of pollution of rivers and coastal waters as well as serious waste crimes, according to the internal document. They recommended that the agency prosecute in all the cases. But the document shows that after intervention by managers just 35 cases were taken forward to prosecution, the rest being dealt with via a lower sanction such as a warning letter, or dropped all together and marked for no further action. Officers investigating the highest categories of waste pollution, including those perpetrated by individuals involved in serious organised crime, recommended prosecution in 386 cases. But only 4% of cases were pursued, while the rest were downgraded to a caution, enforcement notice or warning letter, or marked for no further action. The scale of dropped prosecutions was revealed as the government claimed it was engaged in a crackdown on waste criminals. When it came to investigation of serious pollution incidents in rivers and coastal waters, investigating officers said 109 cases should be prosecuted. These are likely to have involved breaches of permits by water companies leading to illegal discharges of raw sewage, as well as other serious water pollution. Only 21 cases, however, were pursued to a prosecution; just 19%. The information supports claims from within the EA that it has been cut back to such an extent investigating pollution incidents has been deprioritised and the regulator was no longer a deterrent to polluters. The report suggests that EA officials will be ignoring serious waste crime involving organised crime group. Recent instructions to staff, according to a previous Guardian report, are to ignore pollution incidents that are considered lower level; so-called category 3 and 4 incidents. But the internal report reveals that most waste offences are listed under current guidance category 3 and 4, and therefore, under the new guidance would no longer investigated, “even those that are part of major or serious operations dealing with organised crime”. The leaked document says the agency “cannot underestimate the significance of large proportions of cat 3” for waste and water quality pollution incidents. “These include chronic cat 3 impacts associated with priority offenders and long running high risk waste sites that can be deliberate and committed by offenders with enforcement history,” states the document. “In many instances these are more appropriate for an upper tier [stronger enforcement] response than some cat 1 or 3, depending on circumstance,” it said. The report suggests that one reason for the wholesale downgrading could be that the agency’s “resources and our ability to evidence offences and pursue cases to prosecution has reduced over recent years”. Miscategorisation of pollution incidents or permit breaches as low impact when their consequences were actually high impact, is something that concerns the angling community. Campaign group Fish Legal has details of a pollution incident in which building rubble was dumped into a tributary of the River Tamar. It was initially deemed to be category 2 and was later downgraded to category 3 without any inspection or sampling. The perpetrator was sent a warning letter. A spokesperson for the Environment Agency said the regulator does not comment on leaked documents. However, they said it does “consider, record and prioritise all incidents – with all breaches and offences reported to us undergoing a robust initial assessment”. They added: “We have a wide range of enforcement options, including civil sanctions, enforcement undertakings, and in some circumstances, advice and guidance. Where prosecution is appropriate, we pursue robustly and in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors, which sets out that the evidence must provide a realistic prospect of securing a conviction and that a prosecution is in the public interest.” The spokesperson added: “Over 90% of our prosecutions are successful, and recent outcomes such as the £90m fine of Southern Water Services show a clear and welcome trend towards much bigger fines against offenders in appropriate cases.”",News/Environment,Environment Agency downgrading 93% of prosecutions for serious pollution,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/02/environment-agency-england-downgrading-prosecutions-serious-pollution-leaked-report
3/2/2022,"In recent weeks, Shamla Laxman, 54, has been rising at dawn or staying out late at night. She is on the prowl for an item that has become rarer than gold dust in Sri Lanka’s commercial capital of Colombo in recent weeks: sachets of milk powder. “These days it’s become impossible to find, and when you do find it in a shop, the prices are so expensive, double or triple what it was before, that I can’t afford it for my family,” said Laxman, who feeds a family of seven in her small house. Chicken, which used to be a staple, is now a luxury item after it more than doubled in price. “All our basic items have become almost unaffordable now,” said Laxman. “Every day I am fearful of not being able to feed my family tomorrow.” Sri Lanka, an island off the southern tip of India, is in the midst of one of the worst financial crises to hit the country since it became independent in 1948. In recent month, food prices have skyrocketed, there has been a continued dearth of essential goods, fruit and vegetables, and long queues have formed outside petrol stations due to a shortage of fuel. This week, daily power cuts of over five hours began to be imposed across the island and warnings were issued that water supplies might also soon be disrupted. Last week two ships carrying diesel and a tanker of fuel oil sat in the port but their essential cargo could not be brought in as the government didn’t have the dollars to pay for it. Over the weekend, Gemunu Wijeratne, President of the Lanka Private Bus Owners’ Association, warned that buses were not being given enough petrol to continue functioning and that journeys were already being shortened. “If this continues, public transport will collapse and the economy will come to a standstill,” said Wijeratne. It is a crisis many say has been over a decade in the making but was exacerbated by the pandemic and economic policies of the current government, led by president Gotabaya Rajapaksa who came to power in late 2019. Consecutive governments have borrowed high-interest sovereign bonds, which coupled with billions in loans from countries including China and Japan have left Sri Lanka with cripplingly high foreign debt repayments. It has been operating with a $6bn trade deficit, importing far more than it exports, and invested billions in expensive, large-scale infrastructure projects. “We have been spending beyond our means for years,” said Ahilan Kadirgamar, a sociology professor at the university of Jaffna. As the pandemic hit, Sri Lanka lost crucial foreign income from tourism, and tax cuts by the Rajapaksa government meant that the flow of federal income was severely reduced. Over the past two years, inflation has surged, foreign reserves fell by 70% and an ill-advised outright ban on fertilisers crippled the farming industry, leading to an ongoing shortage of fruit and vegetables. Sri Lanka now owes $15bn in foreign bond repayments, with $7bn owed this year and a $1bn repayment required as soon as June, all to be paid in dollars. But with Sri Lanka’s foreign reserves at their lowest levels in years, and the country’s economic rating in the gutter, there are barely any dollars left and many fear the country is headed for a default. “The situation here is very bleak,” said Kadirgamar. The impact on the daily lives of people, from lowest income up to the country’s wealthiest, is palpable. Nishan Shanaka 40, is a civil engineer in Colombo but he now drives an auto-rickshaw in the evenings and on the weekends because his salary won’t cover the cost of food and his children’s education. He described his family’s struggle to afford flour and bread and said they now existed on cheap vegetables. “The cost of everything is far too high now, even if I go to buy a toffee it’s unaffordable,” said Shanaka. “The high fuel prices are impacting everything, my daughters can’t even get the school bus because they can’t afford to run them any more.” Thangarasa Vathani, 48, owner of a fabric and tailoring shop, said she had already had to close one of her tailoring factories, and let go several members of her staff. The few left now worked from her home, but she was concerned she wouldn’t be able to keep them on for much longer. “People here are so disturbed, we don’t know what will happen tomorrow. Those who can afford it are sending their children abroad but not all of us have the money to do that,” said Vathani. The crisis is already affecting industry. Lawrence Wilson runs a lucrative noodle-making factory but has had to cut back production to alternative weeks because the necessary supplies have stopped coming in. “The situation here is dire and it’s only getting worse,” said Wilson, who said he spent his nights trying to find petrol for the car. “Groceries that used to cost 2000 Sri Lankan rupees are now costing 5,000 rupees. I don’t know how people on lower incomes are surviving.” There are many signs that the economic crisis is turning Rajapaksa’s core voting base, the Buddhist Singhalese majority, against him. An editorial in the daily newspaper Daily Mirror last week ran with the headline “Empty treasury, power cuts, fuel shortages and nonsense”. His government’s failure to restructure their foreign loans and refusal to turn to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for an emergency loan as Sri Lanka has done in the past – likely over fears they would impose stringent cost-cutting conditions which would be politically unpopular – has angered many, who now see it as too late. The government is still placing its hopes on the return of foreign tourism and a rise in exports, but experts say it’s unlikely to solve the crisis. “I blame this government,” said Shanaka, who voted for Rajapaksa. “I work hard at a garment factory supplying foreign brands like Nike and Victoria’s Secret and Lulu Lemon. We bring good foreign income into Sri Lanka, but the government has wasted it all away with bad policies. It is a terrible time for this country.”",News/World news,"Milk sachets, chicken, fuel: basics slip out of reach for Sri Lankans as economic crisis bites ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/milk-sachets-chicken-fuel-basics-slip-out-of-reach-for-sri-lankans-as-economic-crisis-bites
3/2/2022,"He is the Russian oligarch who stepped in to keep travel firm Tui afloat, pumping in cash as international tourism came to a standstill during the pandemic. However, Alexei Mordashov – who owns a third of Europe’s biggest tour operator and is its largest single shareholder – may be becoming something of a liability for Tui, whose shares are listed in London, after the EU added him to its sanctions list on Monday night. While Mordashov has not been sanctioned in the UK, his business interests in the region will now be severely curtailed. The EU has outlined various concerns about Mordashov: it claims that Rossiya Bank, in which he has a financial interest, is the “personal bank” of senior Russian officials who have benefited from the annexation of Crimea. The bloc also said it believes media businesses he is invested in had helped destabilise Ukraine through pro-Russian television stations. Russia’s richest man, 56-year-old Mordashov rose from humble origins as the son of mill workers in the city of Cherepovets, 300 miles north of Moscow, to become the chief executive of Russia’s largest steel and mining company, Severstal. He just missed out on a place in the top 50 richest people in the world in 2021, according to Forbes magazine’s list of billionaires, with a ranking of 51. At the time his personal net worth was estimated at an eye-watering $29.1bn, and Mordashov remains the majority shareholder of Severstal, Russia’s largest steel company. Severstal has previously released bulletins detailing how some of its high-strength products are used in the manufacture of Russian defence equipment, including armoured vehicles. Mordashov chairs its parent company, Severgroup, a private investment company, and has interests ranging from telecoms to gold mining, media and engineering. Alongside his wide-ranging business interests, Mordashov owns the kind of accessories no self-respecting billionaire would be without, including a private jet and at least one yacht. Perhaps fittingly for a travel firm shareholder, he is currently reportedly enjoying a holiday far from conflict or the European winter. The billionaire’s Bombardier Global 6000 private jet was last week tracked by plane watchers as having travelled from Seychelles to Moscow, although it did not include data about who was on board. Last Thursday, President Vladimir Putin invited some of Russia’s most prominent business people to a meeting at the Kremlin. Mordashov’s jet – which boasts a large cabin, able to carry 14 passengers, and has a range allowing it to travel from London to Beijing non-stop – did not spend long in Russia before flying back to Seychelles. Meanwhile, one of the billionaire’s yachts, the 142-metre Nord, which shares its name with Mordashov’s gold-mining company, is overwintering in the Indian Ocean. Built by German shipyard Lürssen and delivered in 2021, the vessel cost an estimated $500m and boasts Italian interior design, as well as a helicopter landing pad. The shipbuilder’s breathless description on its website explains how the vessel was “designed with one idea in mind: she must cause strong emotions in every observer, not only through her sheer size, but with the design itself”. At a time of strong emotions, the boss of Tui, Fritz Joussen, made a bid to reassure the travel firm’s staff, insisting that Mordashov’s involvement did not pose a problem. “Mr Mordashov has been a Tui shareholder for around 15 years and has held about a third of our company since he propped it up during the corona crisis,” Joussen wrote in a staff memo. “Our company is run by the executive board, like any German public limited company, and not by the shareholders or the supervisory board. We therefore assume that any restrictions or sanctions against Mr Mordashov will not have any lasting negative consequences for us as a company.” Mordashov first began to invest in Tui in 2007, and has been a member of the company’s supervisory board since 2016. He repeatedly bought shares during 2021, regularly spending millions, and taking his family’s current holding to 34%. In a statement, Mordashov said he did not understand how his inclusion on the EU sanctions list would help resolve the conflict in Ukraine, stating: “I have absolutely nothing to do with the emergence of the current geopolitical tension.” Describing himself as being removed from politics, he called for an end to Russia’s war in Ukraine which he called a “tragedy of two fraternal peoples”. “It is terrible that Ukrainians and Russians are dying, people are suffering hardships, the economy is collapsing. We must do everything necessary so that a way out of this conflict is found in the very near future and the bloodshed stops,” he said.",News/News,Alexei Mordashov: Russia’s richest man is now an EU sanctions target,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/mar/02/alexei-mordashov-russias-richest-man-is-now-an-eu-sanctions-target
3/2/2022,"Hugh Bonneville was as surprised as anyone this week to learn of the extent of the talents of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. “Until today,” he tweeted, “I had no idea who provided the voice of Paddington Bear in Ukraine.” But there is plenty about Zelenskiy’s showbiz career that has been underestimated. When Zelenskiy was elected in April 2019, at the age of 41, the Russian commentator Sergey Parkhomenko said: “He is weak, he does not have a religion, he does not have a nationality.” It was meant as a criticism, even though all these reasons were precisely why people had voted for Zelenskiy. He is not intimidating. He does not come from a political background. He is a Russian speaker from the centre of the country. But, most of all, to Ukrainians, he was recognisable and he was funny. That nice guy off that TV show Servant of the People. You know, the one where the geeky history teacher becomes the president overnight. The Paddington voice guy. Outside the Russian-speaking world, you wouldn’t have known any of this. You probably wouldn’t even have heard of the TV show, even though it was eventually snapped up by Netflix. (It is now available on YouTube with English subtitles.) Beyond Ukraine, until last week, he was simply referred to as “a comedian who became president”. Initial coverage of his landslide victory – in which he won 73.2% of the vote – was derisory. What were the Ukrainians thinking? Who is this guy anyway? He is hardly Ronald Reagan. What a joke. But the word “comedian” is misleading. It suggests someone who is a) not serious and b) a solo performer. Zelenskiy is neither of these things. He has never been a standup. The tradition of “monologue comedy” is fairly new in post-Soviet countries. (Perhaps the only post-Soviet standup known outside Russia or Ukraine is St Petersburg-based Igor Meerson, who performs in Russian and English and has supported Eddie Izzard on tour.) Also, as is now obvious from the viral videos of Zelenskiy’s pre-presidential life, his career may have been in entertainment, but he took it extremely seriously. He is a workaholic, he has always meant business and he is a team player. These are the qualities – forged in the sequined furnace of post-Soviet showbiz life – that give him the edge. It is the “team player” aspect that is really interesting – and perhaps difficult to grasp immediately from a western perspective. If you think about the US or European model of showbiz success – and especially in comedy – performers often start in collectives (Saturday Night Live, Armando Iannucci’s The Day Today lineup), but they rarely stay together. Instead, they usually use the collective as a springboard for a career as a solo performer. Zelenskiy, however, has always been part of something bigger than himself. He started out in 1995, as a teenager, as an improviser in KVN competitions in his area. KVN (Klub Vesyolykh i Nakhodchivykh, or Club of the Funny and Inventive) is a beloved institution known throughout the former Soviet Union, which went on to become one of the longest-running shows on Russian television. (Its social media feeds have been inactive since 27 February.) It grew out of the 60s TV show Vecher Vesleykh Voprosov (An Evening of Funny Questions), in which performers would compete to come up with the funniest answers, in the style of Whose Line Is It Anyway?. Taken off air in the early 70s after it fell foul of the censors, it was revived in 1986 during the era of glasnost and perestroika. Zelenskiy was a keen competitive improviser and became part of Ukraine’s Kvartal 95 team of about 10 players, touring the then recently dissolved USSR, winning KVN competitions and honing their Russian-language sketches. It was only much later that they started to do more sketches in Ukrainian: Zelenskiy’s story represents the fluidity and divides between Russian and Ukrainian cultural audiences. He is and isn’t “one of ours”. In 2003, Kvartal 95 was established as an independent production company, making TV shows and films for Ukrainian and Russian-speaking audiences. The project got a boost when Zelenskiy won Ukraine’s Dancing With the Stars in 2006, performing with his professional partner, Alena Shoptenko. She is still one of the 196 people he follows on Instagram. (He has 13.4 million followers.) Highlights included a jive to Blue Suede Shoes, with Zelenskiy giving it the full pink-satin-jumpsuited Elvis, a pencil moustache for a tango to Big Spender, a blindfolded rumba to Sting’s The Shape of My Heart and a quirky American smooth dressed as Charlie Chaplin. His performances were energetic and all-in – and he was super-fit. This was – and is – clearly important to him: until he became president, he would regularly post videos on social media from the gym, or swimming, or jogging in New York. His screen work grew. In 2008, he played Igor, a Russian dentist living in New York, in Love in the Big City. Igor is one of three friends suddenly struck impotent, who must then find the path to true love in order to regain their virility. (It is easy to react disparagingly to this, but the film made $9m at the box office and it is fair to say that Steve Carell’s The 40-Year-Old Virgin is not too dissimilar in tone.) Two sequels followed. In Office Romance: Our Time (2011), he played Anatoly, a financial analyst with a difficult boss. In trying to get promoted, he ends up falling in love with her, after many shenanigans involving a cable car, a motorbike and other, er, vehicles for physical comedy. Rzhevsky Versus Napoleon (2012), a sort of Carry On Napoleon starring Jean-Claude Van Damme (he waived his fee) and Ksenia Sobchak (the daughter of the former St Petersburg mayor Anatoly Sobchak and rumoured to be Putin’s goddaughter), was one of Zelenskiy’s least successful box office outings and is positively bizarre to revisit now. Zelenskiy plays a triumphant Napoleon at the moment he has captured Moscow and is marching on St Petersburg. (Putin is not known as a big cinema fan, but you have to wonder whether he has seen this film.) His comedy style is in the realm of Steve Martin or, yes, Steve Carell: over-the-top characters, heavy on punchlines and word play, but always on the right side of charming. The films themselves are classic post-Soviet comedy; they would probably read as naive, old-fashioned or at least a bit politically incorrect to western audiences. His sketches with Kvartal 95 are similar to Saturday Night Live: hit-and-miss skits depicting remakes of Shakespeare scenes, mocking influencers or dressing men up as babushki (old women). Some of their best stuff is visual. The Beyoncé-style video that has been shared widely this week is a great example. Four men cavort in leather crop tops and leggings, attempting sexy acrobatic moves as they sing the praises of Ukrainian delicacies: “Borsch! Salo [pig fat]!” Zelenskiy licks his lips as he gazes into the camera: “Tzybulya [onion]!” There are penis jokes galore (think Benny Hill rather than Monty Python, although the latter has been quoted as an inspiration for Zelenskiy) and a common feature of the future president’s characters is an inconvenient erection. Maybe “inconvenient” is the wrong word if you have seen the sketch where he plays Hava Nagila hands-free, trousers around his ankles, playing the piano. But the journey from lewd comedy to president would not have happened without one telly success: Servant of the People. The Kvartal 95 team owns this show, which ran for three seasons between 2015 and 2019, with Zelenskiy as creator, producer and star. The last of the 51 episodes aired on 28 March 2019; Zelenskiy won the election on 21 April 2019. A year earlier, Kvartal 95 had registered Servant of the People as the name of a new political party. In the series, Zelenskiy plays Vasyl Petrovych Holoborodko, a hapless history teacher who is accidentally propelled to the presidency when a video of him berating the government goes viral. The rant that propelled Holoborodko to victory has become a set piece of Russian-language comedy, rather like Ricky Gervais’ robot dance in The Office, but peppered with bleeps (every other word is a swear word). The language content of Servant of the People is interesting. It is in Russian and Holoborodko is a Russian-speaking Ukrainian. But some characters speak Ukrainian. The famous rant, though, is in Russian – and it is a masterclass in how swearing is its own language (a belief strongly held by Russian speakers). Beneath the bleeps, you can make out “okhuyenniye” and “pokhuy” (“fucking”) “suka” (literally “bitch”, usually used as “for fuck’s sake”), “pederasty” (literally “pederasts”, meaning “bastards”) and “pizdets” (cunt). The rant ends: “I wish every teacher lived like the president. And the president – that cunt – lived like a teacher. I’m telling you that as the teacher of history that I am. Even though you don’t give a fuck. Pederasty!” Millions have seen this clip since 2015 and associate Zelenskiy with it – in a good way. There is an ironic parallel with the real-life viral videos coming out of Ukraine at the moment, which are peppered with the exact same words. As Ido Vock wrote in the New Statesman, a Russian friend said to him this week: “Why are we fighting people who swear like us?” Zelenskiy and Holoborodko represent an ordinary bloke who is at the end of his tether and can really, properly swear. The trump card evident now, though, is Zelenskiy’s status as a team player. In his speech to the Russian people last week, he asked them to question official propaganda. Why would he support a war that targets cities he knows and loves? “To shoot who? To bomb what? … Lugansk? The home of my best friend’s mother? The place where his father is buried?” The best friend he is talking about is Yevgeni Koshevoy, known as “Lysy” (Baldy – you can see him dancing in the Beyoncé video), whose family are indeed from Lugansk. The pair have worked together for 18 years and shared the stage in the spring of 2014 when the Kvartal 95 troupe performed to soldiers on the frontline when the war began in Donbas. Koshevoy once said of this time: “People told us they were smiling at our jokes – smiling for the first time in weeks – that night.” He has also testified to Zelenskiy’s work ethic: “Once he got terribly sick with salmonella from a bad egg, but still came out on stage to perform a concert – we carried him to the stage.” David Baddiel tweeted this week: “One thing about Voldymyr – I don’t think he’s going to be looking back on his time (which I hope continues for many years yet) and thinking he didn’t drink fully from the cup of life.” The show must go on.",News/World news,A rehearsal for war: Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s path from comic to symbol of courage,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/a-rehearsal-for-war-volodymyr-zelenskiys-path-from-comic-to-symbol-of-courage
3/2/2022,"A Colombian conservationist who saved a rare species of parrot from extinction, a young feminist activist in Afghanistan, and two poets in Myanmar who used words to protest against the military coup were among 358 human rights defenders murdered in 35 countries last year, analysis has found. The environmentalist Gonzalo Cardona Molina, 55; Frozan Safi, a 29-year-old Afghan economics lecturer; and K Za Win and Khet Thi, two of several poets to be killed, were among those targeted because of their “peaceful and powerful” work, according to a global analysis of threats and attacks faced by human rights activists compiled by Front Line Defenders (FLD). Many of the killings could have been prevented, as they were preceded by threats and calls for protection, according to FLD, which tries to protect activists at risk. As in previous years, most killings took place in the Americas and in the Asia-Pacific region. Colombia, where activists are routinely targeted by armed groups despite the 2016 peace accord, remained the most dangerous country to be a human rights defender, with 138 deaths recorded. The second deadliest country was Mexico, with 42 deaths, followed by Brazil, India, the Philippines and Afghanistan, where the Taliban takeover in August accelerated the country’s human rights crisis. The majority of those killed, 59%, worked on land, environmental and indigenous rights, where their activities disrupted the economic interests of corporations and individuals in mining, logging and other extractive industries. Hundreds more human rights defenders were beaten, detained and charged, FLD said, particularly in the Middle East. Crises in Myanmar, Nicaragua and Afghanistan have forced defenders to go into hiding or flee. Andrew Anderson, director of FLD, said: “In most cases, human rights defenders are threatened. If there was a response when threats are reported and protection measures taken, then surely some of these killings could be prevented. “A lot of the killings in Colombia and Mexico are entirely preventable,” hesaid. “They are planned assassinations of people who the perpetrators want to get rid of. They do it with impunity. “In Colombia, there is a national protection mechanism where the state provides bodyguards and armoured cars to human rights defenders. But that is mainly in the cities. The presence of the Colombian state is limited in rural areas.” In 2020, 331 defenders were killed, across 25 countries. Anderson said: “We are extremely concerned about the number of killings. We have seen an increase in the number of countries. “The big difference this year is the numbers in Mexico and India. In Mexico there is increasing violence in the context of the cartels, and in India, there is a crackdown on civil society more broadly by the Modi government.” A larger proportion of murdered defenders were women and transgender women, 18% of the total killed compared with 13% in 2020. “We’ve seen the horrific killing of women human rights defenders in Afghanistan, including Frozan Safi, who was brave enough to protest in the streets and was lured with the promise of evacuation,” said Anderson. Safi received a telephone call from an anonymous person who claimed they could safely evacuate her from the country. Two weeks later, her body was discovered with the bodies of three other woman. All had been active in demonstrations after the Taliban takeover. The names of the 358 defenders killed last year have been documented and verified by the Human Rights Defenders Memorial, a global initiative of national and international human rights groups. Despite widespread impunity for such killings, 2021 brought a rare moment of accountability. Berta Cáceres, an indigenous environmentalist from Honduras, was murdered on 2 March 2016 after years of threats linked to her opposition of the 22-megawatt Agua Zarca dam. Five years later, Roberto David Castillo, a former president of the internationally financed hydroelectric company, Desa, was found guilty of collaborating in her murder. Indigenous peoples comprise only about 6% of the global population yet made up almost a third of all human rights defenders killed. A separate report by FLD highlighted tactics, including surveillance and the use of anti-terrorism charges by governments to criminalise the activities of human rights defenders. It revealed an “ecosystem of counter-terror laws, special investigative units, militarised battalions and court systems” employed against defenders. “The fabrication of evidence and accusing human rights defenders of terrorism is becoming more brazen and overt,” said Anderson. “They think they can slap on these charges and it will make less scrutiny more likely.” A leak of phone data in July last year suggests human rights lawyers, activists and dissidents were under threat from spyware developed by an Israeli company, NSO Group. An investigation in October by FLD uncovered the presence of NSO Pegasus spyware on phones belonging to six Palestinian human rights defenders. The spyware has since been found on phones of defenders in Bahrain, Jordan and El Salvador, FLD said. NSO have said use of the spyware is only meant for serious criminals and terrorists.

3/2/2022,"There are fears the entire collection at the Lismore Regional Gallery may have been lost during the catastrophic floods in northern New South Wales. The gallery director, Ashleigh Ralph, said that while no one had been able to get access to the building to confirm the situation, flood waters had risen 2.5 metres higher than expected, which meant the top floor of the gallery had been inundated. “The collection we stored up there, it’s got all our major exhibitions on the second floor in case of flooding. Most of them would have been flooded,” Ralph said. “That includes hundreds and hundreds of works from the collection.” The gallery houses several collections from local artists and the Afghan war rugs collection being toured by the Australian National University Drill Hall Gallery. Ralph said all her staff were “safe and accounted for” but she was bracing herself for the collection to be lost along with the building. “It’s a huge blow to the community,” Ralph said. “There’s so much history in our collection. Historical works, from artists in the region, that tell our story. And also the gallery is a place where everyone comes together and shares cultural experiences.” Ralph said she was grateful for offers from people willing to help with the recovery and said the gallery would organise a response in the coming days when the situation could be properly assessed. “It will be our job after this to help share stories and recover and be that place where everyone comes together,” she said. The Afghan war rugs are a collection of textiles produced by weavers that began with the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1979 where they were originally produced as souvenirs. They often include images of maps, tanks, guns, helicopters and messages in broken English and Cyrillic. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Conditions imposed under the gallery’s insurance contract meant they could not be removed from the building. The gallery also houses the Hannah Cabinet, a stunningly intricate cabinet built by master craftsman Geoff Hannah over six years. It is the product of 5,000 hours of work, contains 34 types of timber and veneers, 17 types of stone, four species of shell and 23-carat gold leaf. Hannah, whose home, workshop and woodworking machines were flooded, said he was braced to learn the fate of the cabinet.

It would be just a bloody dreadful loss at the moment, but then, all the rest of the people in Lismore have got loss too.” His family had been caught off guard with the water rising at a rate of two metres an hour, and flood waters sweeping a timber shed from an adjoining property onto his. They managed to escape on a boat before Hannah’s son and grandson set about rescuing 25 other people “until we ran out of fuel”. “No one’s ever witnessed anything like it here,” Hannah said. “Not in our lifetime. Not in our lifetime.”",News/Australia news,Fears Lismore art gallery’s entire collection lost in NSW floods,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/02/fears-lismore-art-gallerys-entire-collection-lost-in-nsw-floods
3/2/2022," It must be high tide at Tynemouth, 19 miles away, where the Tyne flows into the North Sea. Here, the river has responded by rising to its full height. Grey seals, born on the Farnes, sometimes swim upriver into these brackish waters, and in late summer, beyond the bend in the river at Newburn, the muddy banks are enlivened with blue and yellow sea asters. The Tidestone, a mile downstream, marks the 1783 boundary of tidal ebb and flow, but since then, dredging has pushed its limit further upstream, to the weir at Wylam. In six hours, the river will be fast and shallow again, rippling between gravelly spits, but now it’s deep, wide and sluggish. Opposing forces of a rising spring tide and floodwater rushing down from the Pennines have almost fought each other to a standstill: the water is still rising but the current is barely flowing. After days of heavy rain, the river is the colour of brown Windsor soup, loaded with suspended sediment, topsoil eroded from agricultural land upstream. The footpath along the edge of the precipitous riverbank is slithery with mud, and I’m so preoccupied with staying upright that I don’t notice a cormorant, sitting on a tree stump, until I’m just a few yards away. At first it doesn’t fly, but looks at me with eyes as blue as sapphires, then back towards the turbid, silt-laden water. Underwater visibility must be reduced to inches, making feeding nigh impossible for a diving bird that pursues fish. It seems to have been perched here for a while; wet cormorant plumage is black but this bird’s feathers are preened, dry and immaculate, revealing their true colours, indigo and bronze. When I edge closer for a photograph it takes flight, away downstream, perhaps to try its luck at the coast. Last week I watched goosanders catching fish here, but they’ve gone elsewhere. A morose heron remains, close to the edge of the muddy water, folded wings wrapped around its body like a tailcoat, head drawn down into its shoulders. Then it too takes flight and lands in a waterlogged field, a fisherman reduced to eating worms until the tide turns.
