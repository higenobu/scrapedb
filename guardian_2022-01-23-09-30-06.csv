1/23/2022,"In early December 2021, Palestinians and Arabs representing a diversity of creative, activist and academic practice approached the board of Sydney festival after it was revealed the board had accepted $20,000 funding from the Israeli embassy for the presentation of Sydney Dance Company’s realisation of Decadance, a work created by Israeli choreographer Ohad Naharin of the Batsheva Dance Company of Tel Aviv. The amount gave the embassy “star partnership” status with Sydney Festival. We made three requests: divest from the star partnership, end all relations with the State of Israel, and remove any Israeli government emblem from Sydney festival’s promotional material.  In arguing our case for divestment, we said Arab and Palestinian communities would not participate in a festival that does business with a state that stands credibly accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity, according to crimes defined in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. In 2021, Human Rights Watch found Israel is committing “crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution”. We made it clear artists and arts organisations – fundamental partners in any arts festival – felt betrayed by Sydney festival. Finally, we pointed out this partnership denied artists an environment of cultural safety, leaving artists, creatives and companies with no choice but to withdraw. Our arguments were rejected by the board on the grounds Sydney festival is a “non-political organisation”. In response, Palestinians and a cross-section of artists, arts organisations and communities publicly called for a boycott of the Sydney festival, inspired and guided by the global Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, founded and led by Palestinian civil society. The effusive response to the boycott call has been unprecedented, in fact historic. It is being cited as the most effective, creative and impactful campaign targeting complicit Israeli sponsorship of an international arts event in Australia, and indeed one of the most successful in the world. The backlash to this artist-led cultural boycott has been predictable, indeed recycling arguments used in the 1980s against the boycott of apartheid South Africa. One criticism in particular exposes how liberalism’s conceits of “free speech”, “marketplace of ideas”, “open debate” and “dialogue” is weaponised against Palestinians to shut down their right to resist and to deny them “permission to narrate” as renowned Palestinian-American professor Edward Said famously argued in 1984. According to New South Wales arts minister Ben Franklin, it is the boycott – not the actions of Sydney festival – which “shut down specific creative voices simply on account of their nationality”, acting as a “kind of censorship”. In an opinion piece published in the Australian, federal arts minister Paul Fletcher described those involved in the boycott as Stalinist censors and Hamas’ “useful idiots”. Such contrived hysteria over the boycott “stultif[ying] and suppress[ing] artistic and creative excellence”, and laughable comparisons with “Stalinist Russia’”, are amusingly desperate claims and demonstrate just how rattled Israel’s defenders are in the face of incontrovertible daily evidence of that state’s brutality. The arguments are embarrassing and spurious. Organisers have repeatedly stated the cultural boycott aims at institutions not individuals, targeting complicity, not identity. There was never any attempt to shut down the actual production of Decadance. The target of the boycott call was Sydney festival as a cultural institution for its refusal to divest from its sponsorship and therefore its complicity with the State of Israel. That Palestinians and their supporters are being forced to explain and restate the basis and terms of the boycott call, only to be ignored and misrepresented is a form of censorship itself. Whose voices are privileged: those who defend oppression or those resisting it? Those arguing against the boycott claim boycotts “burn” rather than “build” bridges. At the first meeting with the board, artists made the crucial point bridges must be built on ethical and just foundations. A star partnership with the State of Israeli is one way to destroy these foundations and for this reason artists cannot, in good conscience, cross that bridge. The board’s refusal to listen to artists is a form of silencing. The weaponising of “censorship” against the boycott is hollow because the ministers conveniently ignore questions of power and privilege. The power dynamics between artists and the board of Sydney festival, between marginalised communities and the monocultural establishment, between individuals and institutions are key critical points of reflection here. What makes these censorship allegations even more disingenuous is the fact that in the same breath as Palestinians and their allies are accused of being censorious, opposition arts spokesperson, Labor’s Walt Secord called for legislation to cut off funding to arts organisations that participate in a boycott of Israel. Freedom of expression it seems is only afforded to those in power and with power. Those who attack cultural boycotts in the name of “free speech” are invariably missing in action when Palestinians are routinely censored, bullied and “cancelled” for daring to speak their truth. Certainly they remain silent and indifferent to the violent suppression of Palestinian arts and culture, on the raids, lawfare and intimidation of Palestinian artists and artistic and cultural institutions. This is precisely why the boycott of Sydney festival has been called and indeed, why it has been so impactful and effective.

1/23/2022,"Tech stocks have been nursing a new year hangover, pushing the Nasdaq into correction territory. Momentum is building against companies with exciting promises to reshape the world, as investors turn to “value” alternatives such as oil and banking. The tech sector now faces a crunch fortnight as its biggest names report results, including Microsoft on Tuesday, Tesla on Wednesday and Apple on Thursday. They must prove they can thrive in a post-lockdown world where the cost-of-living squeeze is leaving people with less money for tech products and services.  “The outlook for the Nasdaq 100 will be much clearer in two weeks,” says Matt Weller, global head of research at Forex.com and City Index. Soft earnings reports or weak guidance could see the index make one of its worst starts in over a decade. Although a hesitant return to normal life has now been jolted by Omicron, smaller growth stocks such as the pandemic winners Peloton and Zoom have been under pressure for months. A near-record number of tech stocks have recently plunged at least 50% from their all-time highs. The technology giants’ shares have had an incredible run, helping the S&P 500’s IT index to deliver blockbuster returns of 33% in 2021. But the sector lost about 10% in January. Anxiety over US interest rate rises hurts the unprofitable tech firms promising big earnings in the future. The Federal Reserve, which meets this week, is likely to raise rates several times this year to tame US inflation, now at its highest since 1982. The year 1982 was also when Time magazine presciently chose the personal computer as its person (or machine) of the year. Then, the notion of a company being worth 3 trillion dollars would have been staggering. Apple soared to the $3tn mark in early January (but has fallen 7% since) and must overcome the problems in global supply chains to continue justifying such a hefty valuation. Analysts predict Apple’s revenue rose 6% year-on-year in the last quarter, beating last year’s record earnings of $111.4bn. Profits could be up 13%. But it still faces a risk of a marked slowdown in momentum, warn Russ Mould and Danni Hewson of AJ Bell – “due to the tough base for comparison caused by huge spike in demand for iPhones, iPads and iMacs in 2020-21 as people worked from home, sought to stay in touch with people they could not meet or fought boredom by looking for things to do and watch online”. After smashing production targets in the last quarter, Tesla could have more to say about the future, with investors and customers keen to hear when long-awaited models such as the Cybertruck pickup and Roadster sports model will hit the road. Interest in both is high, but Tesla’s shares dropped this month after references to the Cybertruck entering production this year vanished from its website. And even if the tech giants hit their numbers, they still face scrutiny. Meta, owner of Facebook, which reports on 2 February, is being targeted by regulators who want to break it up, and the chair of the Federal Trade Commission, Lina Khan, is vowing not to back down. Khan is a competition law expert who published a seminal paper, “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox”, while still a student. It argued the traditional competition-law framework wasn’t fit to assess the digital giants, so a more expansive one was needed. Amazon and Facebook claim Khan should be removed from antitrust probes because she’s not impartial. But her expertise could be just what’s required to keep Big Tech in check.",News/Business,Nasdaq braces for nervy fortnight as investors fall out of love with tech,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/23/nasdaq-braces-for-nervy-fortnight-as-investors-fall-out-of-love-with-tech

1/23/2022,"Omicron has breached New Zealand’s borders and started spreading, Jacinda Ardern has said, meaning the entire country will be placed on the highest level of restrictions. The prime minister on Sunday said the country would try to slow the spread of Omicron but it was expected New Zealand would reach 1,000 cases a day in the coming weeks and thousands a day after that. New Zealand has not previously reported that level of infection.  “I know hearing these sorts of case numbers will sound deeply concerning for people to hear,” Ardern said. “We’ll do everything that we can to slow the spread and reduce the number of cases we experience as a nation.” The prime minister said nine cases of Omicron had been detected among a family who traveled to Auckland for a wedding and other events. Officials had not yet been able to connect the outbreak to an “index case” at the border. “That means Omicron is now circulating in Auckland and possibly the Nelson Marlborough region, if not elsewhere,” Ardern said. Initial estimates suggest over 100 people were at events attended by the family. A flight attendant on their flight has also tested positive and flown on several flights since. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The country would move to a “red” alert level at midnight on Sunday, the prime minister said. Under red restrictions, businesses and schools remain open and domestic travel can continue, but there are mandates for mask wearing, restrictions on gathering size, and vaccine passes are required for entry to most non-essential businesses. Ardern also urged New Zealanders to get their booster shots. “Omicron is now in more than 80 countries around the world – by delaying its arrival here, we’ve had the time to kick off boosters, vaccinations for children and [to] prepare,” she said. The country has high levels of vaccination among adults: according to the Ministry of Health, 95% of those aged 12 and over have had at least one dose of the vaccine, and 93% have had both. Ardern asked that residents be kind as New Zealand experienced the unprecedented spread of Covid.

Please be kind. I know not everyone sees this pandemic in the same way. But for the most part we are motivated by the same thing, and it’s looking out for each other,” she said. New Zealand had been bracing for Omicron infections to rise as it became clear that the highly infectious variant was likely to find cracks in the country’s strict border measures. There had been several cases of Omicron among workers at the border and in managed isolation and quarantine over the past week. Sunday’s announcement suggests those border-linked cases have crossed over to the wider community. On Thursday, Ardern told New Zealanders that the variant’s wider emergence was only a matter of time. “We will experience in New Zealand cases at a level that we haven’t experienced before. We won’t stop Omicron, but we can try and slow it down,” she said.",News/World news,Red alert: New Zealand prepares for thousands of Omicron cases a day with community spread,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/23/red-alert-new-zealand-prepares-for-thousands-of-omicron-cases-a-day-with-community-spread
