4/21/2022,"Why this, and why now? These are questions that viewers of the new Showtime series The Man Who Fell to Earth may find themselves asking in the expansive existential sense, wondering what combination of choices have taken them down the path that leads to the zillionth and perhaps most inessential entry in the recent streaming-motivated miniseries boom. But this is also worth asking in literal terms: even in our current showbiz paradigm of ravenous, unchecked IP-gobbling, what could’ve compelled TV executives to license a semi-obscure 70s sci-fi gem with dense philosophical underpinnings, and renovate it so thoroughly that it might as well be its own thing? Does Nicolas Roeg’s 1976 film have such a strong cultural market share that the brand recognition of its title can’t be passed up? And more to the point, why take one of the greatest movies ever made and elongate it to ten hours, trade its borderline experimental cinematography for blandly functional digital shooting, and force a perfectly serviceable star like Chiwetel Ejiofor to stand comparison with the inspired inscrutability of David Bowie playing the alien he’d always been? The show gives us the real answer to all this quickly enough, introducing Faraday (Ejiofor) midway through one of the buzz-generating product launches that give today’s CEOs a platform for Steve Jobs cosplay. In his hand, he holds a small box containing something that he announces will change the world, though he’s got more to back up his claim than most self-fashioned gadget gurus of Silicon Valley. Like Bowie’s Thomas Newton before him, Faraday hails from the planet Althea (an Avatar-type land rendered in budget CGI), and he also brought the key to quantum fusion with him when he fled the drought killing his people on a mission for life-sustaining water. Alex Kurtzman and Jenny Lumet’s miniseries positions itself as a sequel to Roeg’s film, alluding to the memory of Bowie and checking back in with aged, recast versions of the extant characters. But they’ve still recycled the original premise, with the most topical aspect now moved to the fore. This extraterrestrial’s relevance is renewed by turning him into a start-up douche, his dreamy parable of corrupted purity converted into a more earthbound address of big tech. Writing partners Kurtzman and Lumet specialize in draining the nuance from beloved genre properties, whether that’s their blockbuster-fied take on The Mummy from the Dark Universe that died in development utero, or their Hannibal Lecter streamer Clarice canceled after one season. They’ve nonetheless failed upward into the intellectual heavyweight class, Roeg’s techniques as well as Walter Tevis’ source novel both too heady for their digestion. The miniseries opts instead to shift its commentaries into a comfortable middlebrow register, spending much of the first four episodes supplied to critics on entry-level spaceman thought exercises. Following the Ted Talk-ish opening, the timeline flashes back to Faraday’s crash-landing as a tabula rasa, albeit with a frustrating lack of consistency to what he does and does not comprehend. He talks like someone doing a bad impression of mental disability whenever he’s not talking like an automaton (one gets the sense a thespian of Ejiofor’s caliber wasn’t taking notes from journeymen TV directors); his acumen in STEM fields seems limitless, yet he’s flummoxed by X-rays and doesn’t know not to deep throat a garden hose. While this defamiliarized perspective allows the homo sapiens that cross his path to see our emotional human peculiarities in a sober light, Faraday’s accumulated allies – bereaved physicist Justin (Naomie Harris), alcoholic capital investor Hatch (Rob Delaney) – more often distract from the point. The miniseries form’s reliance on time-filling subplots leaves this band’s urgent quest particularly unfocused, squabbles between siblings over decades-old patent disputes being small potatoes next to the heat-death of the universe. Those are the stakes, Faraday having arrived just in time to salvage our home from climate crisis along with his own, and the writing feints at an interesting direction only when it extrapolates the global implications of its premise. Hatch rattles off the calamities that would be set in motion by Faraday’s infinite-energy doohickey, and concludes that our environment’s last hope for survival could very well kill us by toppling capitalism. There’s your TV show. At least in the first half, there’s little interest in following through on this thrilling hypothetical, the ‘disruption’ taking place of a more conventional sort. As much as Kurtzman and Lumet want us to see the business side of science as evil, with its underhanded dealings and freebasing of cocaine, there’s an apparent belief in the game-changer innovation they’re selling. What Faraday’s framing as the next big genius fails to account for is that these cults of personality are hollow, built around nimrod weirdoes like Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk predominantly skilled at selling the myth of their own brilliance. Putting Faraday in line with that credulously accepted image sullies Bowie’s interpretation of the character as a fallen angel in existential decline, his inventions more symbol than commodity. This misbegotten addendum loses the big picture for focus on the details of commerce; it’s a crass perversion of something beautiful, not a tragedy about one.

4/21/2022,"There is a moment in the revelatory new PBS Frontline docuseries, The Power of Big Oil, about the industry’s long campaign to stall action on the climate crisis in which the former Republican senator Chuck Hagel reflects on his part in killing US ratification of the Kyoto climate treaty. In 1997, Hagel joined with the Democratic senator Robert Byrd to promote a resolution opposing the international agreement to limit greenhouse gases on the grounds that it was unfair to Americans. The measure passed the US senate without a single dissenting vote after a vigorous campaign by big oil to mischaracterize the Kyoto protocol as a threat to jobs and the economy while falsely claiming that China and India could go on polluting to their heart’s content. The resolution effectively put a block on US ratification of any climate treaty ever since. A quarter of a century later, Hagel acknowledges that the vote was wrong and blames the oil industry for malignly claiming the science of climate change was not proven when companies such as Exxon and Shell already knew otherwise from their own research. “What we now know about some of these large oil companies’ positions, they lied. And yes, I was misled. Others were misled when they had evidence in their own institutions that countered what they were saying publicly. I mean they lied,” he told the documentary makers. Asked if the planet would be better placed to confront the climate crisis if the oil industry had been honest about the damage fossil fuels were causing, Hagel did not flinch. “Oh, absolutely. It would have created a whole different climate, a whole different political environment. I think it would have changed everything,” he said. But Hagel apparently has not asked why he was so willing to be swayed by big oil when there was no shortage of scientists, including prominent Nasa researchers, telling him and other political leaders the truth. The Power of Big Oil has the answer. The documentary’s makers have dug out a parade of former oil company scientists, lobbyists and public relations strategists who lay bare how the US’s biggest petroleum firm, Exxon, and then the broader petroleum industry, moved from attempting to understand the causes of a global heating to a concerted campaign to hide the making of an environmental catastrophe. Over three episodes – called Denial, Doubt, Delay – the series charts corporate manipulation of science, public opinion and politicians that mirrors actions by other industries from big tobacco to pharmaceutical companies responsible for America’s opioid epidemic. Some of those interviewed shamefacedly admit their part in the decades long campaign to hide the evidence of climate change, discredit scientists and delay action that threatened big oil’s profits. Others almost boast about how easy it was to dupe the American public and politicians with consequences not just for the US but every country on the planet. What emerges is a picture of a political system so compromised by corporate money that even when it finally appears that truth will win out, reality is swiftly smothered. Former Senator Timothy Wirth tells the documentary makers how in 1988 he organized historic hearings at which a distinguished Nasa scientist, James Hansen, testified that greenhouse gases were changing the climate. “That was a kind of a magic sentence,” Wirth said. “This was not environmental groups. This was not some green cabal. This was probably the lead climate scientist in the federal government making this statement.” The New York Times reported the testimony on its front page. It seemed a turning point to Wirth and Hansen. Now the country would have to face reality. Instead the hearing served as a warning to the oil industry to intensify its campaign of denialism. “There have been quite a few moments where it has felt to people interested in climate change that it’s all about to change,” said Dan Edge, the The Power of Big Oil series producer, to the Guardian. “There’s a moment in episode one where Senator Wirth laughs and says ‘I really felt we were getting somewhere. It was so exciting.’ That was 30 years ago. Then you hear some of the Obama speeches and the genuine hope that something might be done about climate change in 2009. It was palpable and it was destroyed so quickly.” As the documentary makers trace the evolution of the fossil fuel industry’s success at staving off climate legislation, it becomes clear that the oil firms were swift to adapt their strategies to changing circumstances. Jane McMullen, director of the first episode in the series, said that the research revealed how as it became harder to deny the overwhelming evidence of global heating, the industry shifted gears. “They realized that they were losing the science arguments, especially after the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report came out in ’95 that said there is a discernible human influence. So they turned to economics,” she said. Frontline shows that key to that shift was a little known company in the 1990s, Koch Industries, which specialized in refining and distributing some of the heaviest and dirtiest oil. The firm was run by brothers Charles and David Koch. Charles also founded a libertarian thinktank, the Cato Institute in Washington DC. The Kochs saw a threat to their business from the Clinton administration’s plan for a carbon tax. They mobilized Cato and a Koch-funded front group masquerading as a grass roots organization, Citizens for a Sound Economy, to oppose it. The Kochs drew in lobby organizations, such as the American Petroleum Institute and the Global Climate Coalition, a group of businesses that opposed climate science. “We would be meeting in various locales in Washington with over 100 people in the room. It was a real war room situation,” Jerry Taylor, director of Natural Resources Studies at the Cato Institute, told the program. Jeff Nesbit, communications director for Citizens for a Sound Economy, told the documentary makers that the decision was made to target a Senator from Oklahoma, David Boren, who chaired the committee handling Clinton’s budget and therefore the carbon tax. “They basically said if we can get David Boren to flip, we win. So, they said, we’re gonna do whatever it takes,” he said. The industry ran adverts claiming that the tax would cost the average Oklahoma household $500 a year, and mobilized supporters to call Boren to complain that people would effectively be paying a carbon tax every time they took a shower or drove their car. Years later Nesbit admitted that the supposed public backlash was an illusion manufactured by the Koch brothers. “Maybe there were a handful of folks who thought, oh gosh, I should call my senator and register my complaint. But they had no such grassroots army. It was funded and fueled by the corporate interests,” he said. Still, it worked. Boren caved and killed the carbon tax. The oil industry took note.“He folded right away,” Nesbit told the program. “It’s like wow, this can really work. We can pick our targets strategically and win, even when we’re not in political power.” McMullen said research for the documentary showed that strategy playing out repeatedly over the following years. “It’s become almost accepted fact that tackling climate change will cost the economy whereas look at the cost of damages were faced with today,” she said. The result, she said, is that one administration after another from Clinton onwards found reasons to delay action because they did not want to face accusations of making Americans poorer. “That’s been a problem all the way through this 40 year history. There’s this very strong impetus for politicians to say, we’ll just wait, we don’t need to do it now. But obviously there isn’t time. And the longer you put it off, the steeper the hill that you have to climb to deal with it,” she said.

4/21/2022,"Those Hollywood fellows Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney are never far from social media virality. Last week they were at it again. For reasons that remain unclear, the pair of them have bought Wrexham AFC, in the fifth tier of English football, and pumped some money into the place. Now Reynolds has made McElhenney a birthday present of a urinal at the club’s stadium, placing a commemorative plaque next to it. This put me in mind of a friend of mine, the late and much-missed Jon Brookes, drummer with the Charlatans. When West Brom demolished their home fans’ end of the stadium, he nicked some bricks from it for an extension that his brother, another West Brom fan, was getting built. It was only on the way home with the bricks, in his brother’s Capri, that they realised the bricks were from the toilet block. The stench was awful. But, like the true fans they were, they used them anyway and after a few months the smell abated. I was also reminded of the urinal I have in my flat, sitting below a stained glass window, featuring West Brom’s crest. I’m very proud of it – the urinal more than the crest. I’m a great enthusiast for urinals in the home. This is an enthusiasm shared by very few people, especially women, who have been known to retch at the very sight of it. This baffles me. Many a chap has been chastised about his incompetent use of conventional toilets – poor aim, not putting the seat down, and so on. Well, here’s the answer: a receptacle at the correct height for ease of use, which is neat, tidy, clean and flushable. It changed my life. Gentlemen – or anyone with a penis – trust me: it is wonderful to have a toilet of one’s own.

4/21/2022,"Posts casting doubt on evidence of alleged war crimes in Bucha have been shared hundreds of thousands of times on Facebook, analysis by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue has found. Researchers analysed the 10 most shared posts on Facebook mentioning Bucha – a suburb of Kyiv formerly occupied by Russian forces – in 20 countries and found 55 posts disputing evidence of violence against civilians. These posts were shared 208,000 times in the week to 6 April, compared with 172,000 shares that did not question the veracity of images emerging from the town. Among the most popular posts mentioning Bucha, the average number of shares was three times higher for posts casting doubt on alleged war crimes compared with those which did not. The mayor of Bucha told Reuters that 400 dead bodies had been uncovered since the Russians withdrew from the town, though this figure has yet to be independently verified. Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilians and claimed photographs of corpses were staged. However, satellite images published by the New York Times contradict Moscow’s claim that Ukrainian forces placed dead bodies in the street as a “staged provocation” after Russian soldiers had already withdrawn. The images, taken in mid-March, show corpses on the streets in the days before the Russian retreat and their positions match those seen in other smartphone photos. A report by Human Rights Watch has documented cases of apparent execution of civilians in Bucha, while the Guardian has also reported witness accounts of widespread violence. Posts questioning evidence of Russian violence against civilians were present in Italy, Austria and the Czech Republic, among other EU countries. The most shared post about Bucha in Austria – also the third most shared post in Germany – contained text copied from a pro-Russian German language outlet called Anti-Spiegel. Echoing a Russian interpretation of the events, the post suggested that the victims were in reality killed by the Ukrainian army as a punishment for their support of the Russian army. Francesca Visser, an analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, said: “The findings show us that the challenges in confronting pro-Kremlin narratives and disinformation emanate from a wider set of actors than just Russian state media. “Despite the efforts of independent factcheckers and journalists on the ground who debunked many of the false narratives spread by sources tied to the Russian state, these narratives managed to gain traction among a wide audience. “It’s concerning that in the aftermath of the massacre, the most shared posts on Facebook are those casting doubt on the veracity of the images. It’s also concerning that posts coming from platforms and bloggers known for spreading false and misleading narratives are outperforming verified information.” A spokesperson for Facebook said: “This report relies on a small sample size and misrepresents the scale and scope of our effort to combat misinformation related to the war in Ukraine. “We have the most robust system for factchecking false claims of any platform and our factchecking partners have debunked multiple claims about the atrocities in Bucha in several languages including Ukrainian, Russian, and English.”",News/World news,"Facebook posts disputing Bucha atrocities shared 208,000 times in a week",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/21/facebook-posts-disputing-bucha-atrocities-shared-208000-times-in-a-week
4/21/2022,"On 6 January 2021, Jerry Braun hailed an Uber in Washington DC and got in the car, nursing a bleeding eye wound. The Uber driver noticed and asked, “So, has it been violent all day?” “Well it started around, right when I got there. I tore down the barricades,” Braun bragged. The conversation, captured on video by the driver’s recording device installed on the dashboard, triggered a 15-month long investigation by the FBI. Earlier this month, on 12 April, Braun was finally arrested by federal authorities and charged with violent entry or disorderly conduct, obstruction during civil disorder, and entering and remaining on restricted grounds, according to an affidavit by Lucas Bauers, FBI special agent. Braun boasted openly to the Uber driver about his involvement in the deadly riots, which resulted in the deaths of five people. When he explained he’d torn down the barricades, the driver asked, “You did? Why?” “Well, because, so we could get to the Capitol,” Braun replied. The driver asked, “Well, how’d that work out for ya?” “Well, it looks like, uh, Biden’s gonna be our president,” said Braun. The Uber driver’s tip to the authorities identified Braun as “Jerry Last Name Unknown”, according to court documents. The car dropped him off at a Holiday Inn in Arlington, Virginia; authorities searched the booking records to discover that Braun had checked in as “JD Braun” on 5 January and checked out two days later. He had listed his phone number and an address in South El Monte, California. Authorities then compared the Uber image of Braun with a California Department of Motor Vehicles photo of him. With a positive match, they began to pore over images and video footage taken on the day of the riot, searching for Braun. “Agents reviewed several images on the webpage, including one of the digital images that depicts an individual with a white beard, wearing a black face mask covering his nose and chin, black sunglasses, a black beanie hat, black gloves, and a dark colored jacket with a hood,” said the affidavit. “The individual’s white beard is coming out from underneath the black mask, and a backpack shoulder strap is seen over the individual’s left shoulder,” it added. Authorities also noticed a pocket holding a pen and paper with graphics “near the individual’s left shoulder”. Upon enlarging the image, they found the following text: “23-359-4”, “Ask For JD”, and a website, shotgunshock.com – the website of a South El Monte-based store that sells motorcycle air-suspension systems. Officials accessed the Google cached version of the site and found an email address, shotgunshock@yahoo.com – which turned out to be the same address associated with Braun’s Uber account – and a phone number that was registered with the AT&T Corporation under “Jerry Braun”, according to court documents. The affidavit included screenshots of video footage that showed Braun “physically struggling with law-enforcement officers using a barricade”. At one point, Braun is also seen with a wooden plank in his hands. “The officer body camera videos show Braun in possession of the wood plank, controlling the wood plank and maneuvering the wood plank towards law enforcement officers in an aggressive manner,” the affidavit said. “In one instance … Braun extends the wood plank and physically strikes an individual who is wearing a helmet with the text ‘PRESS’ displayed across the front (the photographer) and appears to be taking photographs with a camera,” it added. “Braun and the photographer appear to exchange words. Braun then strikes the photographer with his left hand, and subsequently strikes the photographer once more with the wood plank.” On 8 November, authorities executed a search warrant in Braun’s California residence and found clothing he appeared to wear at the riot. They also seized Braun’s cellphone, which included a selfie of his eye wound as well as text message exchanges in which Braun wrote, “Occupied the capitol”, and “Hand to hand combat”, in reference to videos he took at the riot. When authorities asked Braun if he had anything to say during the search, Braun replied, “Guilty.” Authorities then asked him what he was guilty of, to which he said, “Everything.” More than 800 people have been charged for their involvement in the riot, of which more than 250 have so far pled guilty.",News/US news,Capitol rioter caught after FBI finds recording of him boasting to Uber driver,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/20/capitol-rioter-caught-fbi-recording-uber
4/21/2022,"Laura Wandel’s debut feature was Belgium’s official submission for the Oscars: a kid’s-eye-view nightmare of playground bullying impossible to watch without a sick, jittery feeling of rage and dread. The original French title is “Un Monde” – “A World” – and the playground is a universe of fear which we all edit out of our adult memories. A rather amazing seven-year-old newcomer called Maya Vanderbeque stars as Nora, seen mostly in extreme, searching closeup. Just the opening shot of her crying face supplies pretty much enough emotional charge to power the whole film. Nora is just starting school, and her sobbing mini-drama-queen distress at the school gates discomforts her dad (Karim Leklou) and especially her older brother Abel (Günter Duret), a wannabe tough guy who doesn’t want his clingy kid sister embarrassing him in the playground. When she witnesses him being bullied by the other boys – with whom Abel had hoped to bully someone else – she tells the teachers and her dad, thus humiliating him and breaking a whole unwritten statute book about not snitching. At first, Nora artlessly tries informing on the bullies to her own teacher, Mme Agnès (Laura Verlinden) whose ineffective attempts at rebuking the boys appears to irritate their teacher, whose prerogative this actually is, and who perhaps sees Mme Agnès’s intervention as an implied criticism of her professionalism. And so at the crucial moment she has neither the time nor the inclination to back her up: a fatal concession. And when Nora’s dad clumsily tries yelling at the bullies, it naturally makes things far worse, a mishandled situation which metastasises horribly. A world of adult indifference is revealed: those supposed authority figures are way out of the frame, as remote as the uniformed prison guards patrolling the exercise yard. As with Yasmin Reza’s stage-play Carnage, filmed by Roman Polanski in 2011, or perhaps the enigmatic schoolgates scene that closes Michael Haneke’s 2005 film Hidden, the power politics of kids has implications for the adults. The playground’s hidden theatre of violence echoes in the headteacher’s office and in the kitchens at home, among the grownups whose own childhoods involved dutifully learning the lesson that violence is unacceptable – but who find that anger is still a natural instinct when it comes to protecting and being seen to protect. As for Nora herself, the film shows us that she is not exactly a moral agent: she fiercely objects to bullying, but also unhelpfully denounces Abel’s failure to stand up for himself and objects to anyone’s failure to take her feelings into account. It is her tactless courage and willingness to intervene that is finally to make a difference – but she is also a bit of an egotist. There is a telling scene in which she hugs her beloved Mme Agnès with that same theatrically possessive desperation she showed in the opening shot, which makes the teacher just the tiniest bit impatient with her. At just 72 minutes, this is a brief, intense feature: it’s possible that Wandel envisaged it as even shorter than it actually is, and perhaps its narrative tendons slacken a little after the initial spasm of horror. But what an incredible performance from Vanderbeque: an intuition of fear and pain and moral outrage that goes beyond acting.

4/21/2022,"In a move designed to help counter overtourism, accommodation provider Sawday’s has announced that it will cap the number of places to stay it represents in some of the worst-affected areas. The B Corp-certified company, which includes the brands Sawday’s, Canopy & Stars and Paws & Stay, has identified 13 destinations in the UK and Europe experiencing overtourism. The initiative will effectively limit the company’s own capacity for growth in these at-risk areas, which include the Isle of Skye, Snowdonia, St Ives and the Lake District in the UK, and European hotspots such as Venice and Barcelona. The pioneering policy is intended to help tackle problems that blight tourism honeypots, including strains on infrastructure and services, second-home ownership and unaffordable housing, overcrowding, and damage to ecosystems. It means that in some areas it will need to stop representing one place to stay before it can add a new one. And while Sawday’s recognises that the impact of this policy may be small, it hopes to inspire other travel companies. “The constant desire for insatiable growth by some holiday operators, accommodation platforms and large cottage companies is unsustainable. Communities need viable visitor numbers in areas affected by overtourism,” said Sawday’s managing director Mike Bevens. Travel booking website Skyscanner has launched an electric and hybrid car hire search filter this month, making it easier for travellers to book greener transport. With more transparency on cost comparisons for electric car hire, coupled with a rapidly expanding network of electric charging points across Europe and the US, Skyscanner expects demand for greener car hire to grow. There are now more than 374,000 public chargers across Europe. Skyscanner research has highlighted Portugal as one of the most affordable destinations to rent an electric car this summer. The new tool builds on the website’s Greener Choices flight filter, which launched in 2019 and helps travellers find flights that emit less CO2. This July, Ireland-based high-altitude trekking company Earth’s Edge will run the first all-female expedition to Kilimanjaro. The trip will employ 80 local women in Tanzania to work as guides, cooks and porters. It’s part of the B Corp-certified tour operator’s drive to increase the number of women it works with in countries including Peru, Kenya and India. After gaining experience as porters, it is hoped that more Tanzanian women can progress to becoming Kilimanjaro guides – one of the most lucrative jobs in the region – in a male-dominated industry. In the run-up to the summer expedition, Earth’s Edge has partnered with the Kilimanjaro Porters Assistance Project, a non-profit group working for the ethical treatment of porters, to recruit, train and encourage more local women into the field. Earlier this month, adventure travel specialist Explore unveiled one of the most comprehensive carbon measurement projects in the travel industry. For all of its 515 trips, the company has audited transport, accommodation, food, activities and operational business emissions and now lists the overall carbon footprint calculation for each tripall trips. The data gives consumers greater transparency about the environmental impact of their travel. Explore already offsets all of its trips with ClimateCare and works withclear carbon calculations are in place, it intends to use the data to reduce emissions across the business by 50% by 2030. The UK’s Pura Aventura and Wilderness Group have also introduced carbon labelling; Pura Aventura goes one step further by factoring in international flights. Hotelplan UK, a launch partner of the Glasgow Declaration on Climate Action in Tourism at Cop26 and umbrella company for Inghams, Esprit Ski and Santa Lapland, appointed its first group head of sustainability during the pandemic, spurring a raft of green policies. This March it partnered with ClimateCare to support Gold Standard carbon-offsetting projects, but in 2023 it has committed to auditing the footprint of all its holidays so that the process of reducing emissions can begin in earnest. It’s also now working with charity Protect Our Winters UK and has teamed up with Eco Ski, a skiwear business launched in 2020 to encourage winter holidaymakers to repair, rent or buy pre-owned gear; Hotelplan customers get 15% off rentals. Tapping into the rise of event-based tourism, slow travel tour specialist Byway is launching a flight-free travel planning service for international events. Its launch partner is Run for Love, a six-day charity race taking place in Croatia this May that raises funds to support victims of trafficking. Through the Byway partnership, contestants will be given the option to travel to the start point entirely by train. Founder Cat Jones, who launched Byway in 2020, sees the move as an expansion into providing A to B flight-free travel anywhere in Europe, for both leisure and business travel. “Our mission is to make slow travel mainstream,” says Jones. “We’ve built this pretty sophisticated tech that allows us to construct [flight-free] routes. It’s about regaining that sense of travel and discovery, rather than powering through from A to B.” Last October, adventure tour company Exodus set a goal to become nature net positive by 2024, building on its plan to halve carbon emissions by 2030 and offer flight-free options for a number of tours. The aim of the Nature First initiative is to not only reduce its impact on natural ecosystems, but to outweigh the impacts by proactively supporting regeneration. It works Rewilding Europe to rewild a minimum 100sq m of land for every person who books a trip. One of its biggest projects is in the Apennines, where Exodus has funded the rewilding of 400 hectares over the past year, with the potential to remove about 1,500 tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere every year. A new walking trip for 2022, Rewilding in the Italian Apennines, will allow customers to experience the project first-hand. Founded in 2018, Lovat has become the UK’s first B Corp holiday park group, with nine bases in regions including Cornwall, Suffolk and Norfolk. Projects range from beach toy libraries to food composting bins, and free water refill stations to local sourcing for its cafes. Lovat also supports food banks close to its holiday parks and this year has launched an ambitious plan to reduce landfill waste by 90% by 2025, with a 25% target for this year. As part of this pledge it will remove all single-use plastic bottles from sale in on-site shops and cafes, which could stop more than 1,700 bottles going to landfill from its Cornish parks alone. This January when Intrepid recertified its B Corp status, it improved its score by nearly 10%. It’s in the process of reviewing its top 50 trips to remove internal flights under 90 minutes as part of plans to decarbonise the business. Intrepid says it has always put local communities at the heart of tours and in-country operations, and this is reflected in the 22 new tour experiences it has added for 2022. Called “impact initiatives”, the experiences will directly benefit local people, aid nature and wildlife conservation or preserve indigenous culture. They include e-rickshaw rides in Jaipur with women from low-income households, a chance to meet Vietnamese craftspeople making art from rubbish collected in Hạ Long Bay, and dining at a First Nations restaurant in British Columbia. In response to a growing number of inquiries, Italian villa firm Tuscany Now & More has launched a portfolio of sustainable villas, from contemporary solar-powered pads to heritage farmhouses restored using sustainable materials.

4/21/2022,"Democracy watchdogs and civil society activists in Serbia have warned that the country is sliding towards autocracy under President Aleksandar Vučić, who was elected for a second term this month with a large majority. After a campaign marred by reports of widespread bribery, intimidation and gerrymandering, Vučić won 60% of the presidential vote. The outcome of the parliamentary and Belgrade city elections, however, is still unclear. The opposition is waiting for courts to decide whether balloting will be repeated in areas where they have raised complaints of severe irregularities. As a result, a new government will not be formed for several months. “The most likely situation is that Vučić will drag this process out and it will be chaos, and he always uses chaos to his advantage,” said Bojan Elek, deputy director at the Belgrade Centre for Security Policy. “He is such a great calculator and strategist he is able to turn any situation to his favour.” However, the war in Ukraine presents the president with a significant challenge, as Serbia is seemingly poised between its application to be a member of the EU and an instinctive alliance with Russia. The two countries have close historic, religious and cultural ties and Moscow has provided crucial support to Belgrade at the UN security council, blocking Kosovo’s independence. Moreover, Serbia is totally dependent on Russian oil and gas. This week, Vučić accused Ukraine and an unnamed EU country of orchestrating a series of bomb hoax threats against Air Serbia planes. He did not provide evidence for the claim, which Ukraine called “baseless”. But after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the signals coming from European capitals to Belgrade make it clear that Vučić’s balancing act is no longer viable. “They are asking for more harsh condemnation – this could be an easy win – and definitely to join some sort of sanctions,” said Elek. “He will try to play it a little longer like this, but I think if he finally has to make a decision, the only rational choice would be to pick the pro-European side. They might decide to join packages of sanctions that would not hurt Serbia too much.” The president was slow to condemn the Russian aggression, which was initially reported in pro-government tabloids as a Ukrainian invasion of Russia. Nor has Serbia adopted any of the EU’s sanctions against Russia since the 2014 annexation of Crimea. But Serbian analysts believe the president is likely to join direct sanctions on Moscow if the war is still going on when his new government is finally formed. Despite a clear awareness of Vučić’s autocratic tendencies, Angela Merkel and Ursula von der Leyen both made visits to Belgrade within a month of each other last year. “I don’t think it’s helpful but I can understand. The issue is that the EU doesn’t see in the opposition a credible, strong enough partner,” said Biljana Đorđević, an opposition MP with the newly formed green-left coalition Moramo (we must), which won 13 seats. She described a culture of endemic abuse of parliament by the ruling party, using as an example the 2018 budget, which was passed without debate after its MPs used hundreds of amendments to filibuster and block any questions from the opposition. “Unfortunately they [European leaders] chose stability over democracy, which is really bad. It has also undermined the EU here in Serbia. People have become Eurosceptics, which is understandable.” Stability in the Balkans is critically important to the EU, and in Vučić Brussels appears to have found a politician who can offer that. At the last election in 2020, Vučić secured 188 seats in the 250-seat parliament. This result was, however, largely because of a boycott by opposition politicians who were protesting against verbal abuse and sabotaging of parliamentary processes by ruling party MPs. “The situation in parliament was really bad. People from the ruling party were very verbally aggressive, it’s insane the things they say about you,” said Đorđević. Vukosava Crnjanski, the director of democracy watchdog CRTA, explained that in the absence of an opposition in parliament for the past two years, civil society figures were unwillingly thrust into the role. “We were constantly under attack,” Crnjanski said, describing smear campaigns against CRTA and her personally in parliament and pro-government media. “What we are seeing is a serious backsliding of democracy in Serbia, especially in the functioning of institutions, including parliament. In 2016, [the ruling party] started silencing every free voice in Serbia.” Sofija Todorović, a programme director at the Youth Initiative for Human Rights in Belgrade, said that far-right and nationalist groups are intimidating civil rights bodies with impunity. Todorović was attacked by nationalist football supporters at the Mirëdita, dobar dan festival in 2017, an annual event promoting cultural ties between Kosovo and Serbia that she helps to organise. After the assault, she was fined more than £350 for protesting during a speech made by convicted war criminal Veselin Sljivancanin at an event organised by the president’s party. Serbia is one of four Balkan countries negotiating access to the EU. A 2021 report by the European Commission on its progress in areas of necessary reform noted an alarming lack of media freedom, assaults on opposition and civil society activists, corruption, organised crime and state control of police and judiciary. “Inflammatory language against political opponents and representatives of other institutions expressing diverging political views was still used during parliamentary debates,” the report warned. “The nature of autocracy is that you can’t go back, it’s very difficult to ‘de-autocratise’ a leader, unless there is some huge external shock, which may have happened with the war in Ukraine,” said Elek. “In order to stay on his path towards autocracy, Vučić needs the support of the west. Our fear is if he decides to turn his back on Russia, this will allow him to continue.”",News/Global development,Serbia ‘sliding towards autocracy’ as president secures second term,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/21/serbia-sliding-towards-autocracy-as-president-secures-second-term
