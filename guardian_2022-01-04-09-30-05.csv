1/4/2022,"Elizabeth Holmes, founder of Theranos, has been found guilty on four of 11 charges of fraud after a jury delivered a partial verdict following a dramatic day in which jurors said they remained deadlocked on three counts. Jurors announced the decision following a high-profile, 15-week trial that chronicled the missteps of the now-defunct blood testing startup.  On Monday, the seventh day of deliberations, the jury said in a note to the judge that it was unable to reach to reach a unanimous verdict on three of the 11 criminal counts that Holmes faced. In response, the US district judge Edward Davila encouraged them to deliberate further, but jurors later returned and said they were unable to proceed, before rendering their final decision. Holmes, 37, was charged on 11 counts of defrauding investors and patients and faces 20 years in prison. She pleaded not guilty. The verdict seals Holmes extraordinary rise and fall and could have wide-ranging consequences for Silicon Valley. Over the course of nearly four months, federal prosecutors called 29 witnesses, outlining missteps and alleged fraud Holmes committed during her 15-year reign as CEO. Holmes founded the company after dropping out of Stanford at 19 years old, promising a revolutionary technology that could run hundreds of health tests on just a drop of blood. But the company ultimately fell short of its ambitious pledge. A charismatic character known for her blonde hair, uniform of black turtlenecks, and low voice, Holmes quickly rose to fame in and outside the tech world, gracing the covers of major magazines, headlining conferences, and drawing comparisons to Apple’s Steve Jobs. As Theranos grew, the company attracted big-name investors including the former secretary of states George Schultz and Henry Kissinger. At its height, Theranos was valued at more than $9bn. But cracks in the glossy surface began to show in 2015 when Wall Street Journal reporting revealed that its in-house tests had massive inaccuracies, and that the company was performing other tests using traditional blood drawing methodology and outside labs. The fall of Theranos has been followed with perhaps even more fervor than its spectacular rise, inspiring multiple documentaries, a feature film, and an upcoming television show. Starting in late August, throngs of reporters have lined up in the early morning hours for a seat inside the federal court house in San Jose, California. During the trial, prosecutors painted a picture of Holmes as a strict, power-hungry leader willing to go to any lengths to save her company’s image, repressing internal and external dissent and manipulating the press. “She chose fraud over business failure,” prosecutor Jeff Schenk said in his closing arguments. “She choose to be dishonest with investors and patients. That choice was not only callous, it was criminal.” As witnesses, the prosecution called forward Theranos lab directors who testified that their concerns over the technology’s shortcomings were largely ignored. Meanwhile, investors such as the former US secretary of defense James Mattis said he and others were discouraged from scrutinizing the company for fear of missing out on opportunities. The defense team for Holmes sought to counter that image by portraying Holmes as an ambitious entrepreneur who did not knowingly commit fraud, but rather did not understand the shortcomings of Theranos’ complex technology. Those arguments came to a head when Holmes made the stunning decision to take the stand in her own defense, arguing she made decisions in good faith and did not knowingly commit fraud. Prosecutors repeatedly pointed to documents that Holmes admitted to doctoring before sharing with potential partners, adding the logos of pharmaceutical firms and falsely implying they had endorsed the methodology. “I wish I hadn’t done that,” she told the jury on the stand. Her defense team stated in closing arguments that the logo evidence was “a distraction” and that Holmes was in talks with those companies at the time. Her attorneys also put forward a line of defense that Holmes was abused by her former romantic and business partner Sunny Balwani, who served for ten years as co-president of the company. “There was another side of Holmes’s relationship with Balwani that the public never saw,” said defense attorney Lance Wade said in opening arguments, adding that “trusting [Balwani] as her primary adviser was one of her mistakes”. Some of the most powerful moments in the trial came when Holmes testified directly about Balwani’s alleged abuse, growing emotional as the prosecution called on her to read their romantic texts. She claimed he controlled what she did, who she spent time with, and even what she ate in an effort to turn her into a successful CEO. Balwani has strongly denied claims of mistreating Holmes. He faces his own trial in 2022 for fraud.",News/Technology,Elizabeth Holmes trial: jury finds Theranos founder guilty on four fraud counts,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/03/elizabeth-holmes-trial-jury-finds-theranos-founder-guilty-on-four-counts
1/4/2022,"The number of UK first-time homebuyers has hit its highest level since 2002, according to a new estimate. Despite the uncertainty generated by the pandemic and strong house price growth, the number of first-time buyer transactions in 2021 is estimated to be 408,300, according to Yorkshire Building Society.  That would be a 35% increase on the 303,000 transactions in 2020, and more than double the levels in the years following the global financial crisis of 2007-08. The previous first-time buyer peak was in 2002, when 531,800 households took their first step on to the housing ladder, and one would need to go back 15 years to see numbers similar to those being predicted for 2021, said the Yorkshire. In 2006, the number of first-time buyers was 400,900. “Clearly, new buyers have not been deterred by the price of a typical first-time buyer home, which has increased by 9% to £222,997 in the year to October,” the building society said. Average house prices have surged to record highs over the past year, presenting an obstacle to many trying to buy their first home. Meanwhile, the continuing pandemic – including a third national lockdown running from January until March last year – is likely to have caused some to put their home-buying plans on hold. However, a range of factors including low borrowing costs and government guarantees for mortgages arguably helped others to take their first step on to the property ladder. The stamp duty holiday – which ended on 30 September 2021 in England and Northern Ireland – has been credited with fuelling a boom in the market. First-time buyers already benefited from stamp duty relief on the first £300,000 of the purchase price, but the additional relief on the value between £300,000 and £500,000 will have led to savings – and reduced borrowing – in many cases, particularly benefiting new buyers in pricier areas such as London and the south-east, said the society. Meanwhile, many people’s spending plummeted during the lockdowns, which meant some would-be first-time buyers were able to save up a larger sum for a deposit more quickly than perhaps they had anticipated. The new figures are for first-time buyers purchasing with a mortgage. However, Yorkshire said it was unlikely that first-time buyer numbers would continue at this level during 2022 and beyond. First-time buyers accounted for half of house purchases with a mortgage in 2021, which is the same proportion as last year, though in the years between 2006 and 2011 the figure was below 40%. The analysis was based on lending figures up to October 2021 from the banking body UK Finance, with Yorkshire Building Society making estimates for November and December last year.",Lifestyle/Money,UK house sales to first-time buyers reach highest for 19 years,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/04/uk-house-sales-first-time-buyers-highest-nearly-20-years
1/4/2022,"Adele and Ed Sheeran may have topped the UK sales charts in 2021, but it was decades-old songs by “heritage acts” such as Queen and Fleetwood Mac that helped millions of Britons through the pandemic, music industry figures suggest. British artists accounted for eight of the top 10 albums listened to in the UK last year, and many will not be surprised to learn that the No 1 and No 2 spots were taken by Adele and Ed Sheeran respectively with their blockbuster releases 30 and =. Both achieved more than 500m streams in 2021 in the UK alone, plus billions more globally, according to data released by the record labels’ association the BPI on Tuesday.  Adele’s album, her fourth, was released in November, and notched up first-week chart sales of 262,000. Sheeran also had the bestselling single of 2021 with Bad Habits. However, the list revealed that during troubled times many people reach for the familiarity and comfort provided by classic acts, many of which are being discovered by new generations of music fans thanks to streaming. At No 5 in the table of 2021’s bestselling and most streamed albums was a record originally released 40 years ago: Greatest Hits by Queen, featuring tracks including Bohemian Rhapsody and We Will Rock You. No 8 was Diamonds, a greatest hits album from Elton John. Originally issued in 2017 , it feature classic songs from 1970 to 2016. No 9 was 50 Years – Don’t Stop, a career-spanning collection from Fleetwood Mac that was released in 2018. In third place was another heritage act, albeit one releasing an album of new music. Abba staged pop’s biggest comeback with their new collection Voyage, which will be accompanied by a “digital avatar” concert residency in a London arena from May. Newcomers did manage a look-in, though, with the US singer Olivia Rodrigo and the UK rapper Dave featuring in the albums top 10. The BPI said streaming in particular was enabling a vast array of new British artists, from guitar bands such as the Lathums to soul singers including Joy Crookes, to break through. One-hundred and eighty artists achieved more than 100m streams in the UK over the past 12 months, while more than 1,900 acts had their songs streamed at least 10m times in Britain. While streaming continues to dominate the way we listen to music, the vinyl renaissance continued apace in 2021, with sales at their highest level in three decades. Another blast from the past – audio cassettes – enjoyed a resurgence, sales increased by a fifth to hit an 18-year high, providing fresh evidence of the collectible appeal of recorded music on physical formats. Overall, recorded music consumption in the UK rose by 2.5% in 2021, with 159m albums or their equivalent either streamed or bought across all formats. Streaming accounted for 83% of overall music consumption in the UK last year, when people listened to more than 147bn audio streams, up 5.7% on the 139bn in 2020, according to the BPI. However, the appetite among some music fans for vinyl shows no sign of waning. The format defied supply chain and production challenges in 2021 to rack up a total of 5.3m copies sold. That is 11% up on the previous and amounts to a fourteenth year of consecutive growth. One of the biggest hits was Abba’s Voyage, which was described as the “fastest-selling vinyl of the century”. Compact discs have been in decline since 2004, though in 2021 the rate of decrease slowed to 11%, said the BPI. Geoff Taylor, the BPI’s chief executive, said: “As our lives continue to be disrupted, the past 12 months have reminded us again of the important role that recorded music plays in our lives. At the same time, the rise of streaming has empowered more artists than ever – from all backgrounds and eras – to build new fanbases around the world and to forge successful careers in music.”",News/Business,Adele and Sheeran top sales charts but UK is buoyed in 2021 by Abba and Queen,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/04/adele-sheeran-abba-queen-2021-sales-streaming-top-10-albums
1/4/2022,"Refugee charities are urging the government to open safe routes or risk a new wave of fatalities in the Channel after the number of people who travelled to the UK by small boats trebled last year. Data released on Tuesday shows that more than 28,300 people crossed the Channel in 2021, three times the number for 2020. The record number came despite tens of millions of pounds being spent by the home secretary, Priti Patel, on new measures to discourage the journeys.  Organisations that help new arrivals said the figures showed that the government’s strategy risked more deaths at sea. In one incident in November, 27 people including a seven-year-old boy and a pregnant woman drowned in the worst tragedy of its kind. Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said he could envisage more deaths without a rethink. “This government must change its approach and instead of seeking to punish or push away people seeking safety because of the type of journey they have made to the UK, they must create and commit to safe routes,” he said. Clare Moseley, the founder of Care4Calais, which supports refugees living in northern France, said: “The government tells us that people should travel by legal means but if this were truly possible, why would so many be risking their lives in flimsy boats?” Minnie Rahman, the interim head of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said the government’s closure of safe routes had encouraged more dangerous journeys. “What’s changed is that safe routes to get here – like family reunion routes and the Syrian resettlement scheme – have completely shut down, forcing more people into the hands of people traffickers to get here,” she said. At least 28,395 people reached the UK on small boats in 2021, according to analysis by the Press Association. The number of arrivals peaked in November when at least 6,869 people reached the UK. Between 10 and 16 November more than 3,100 made the perilous crossing, the most in any seven-day stretch in the current crisis. The same month also saw a new record for a single day in the crisis, with 1,185 people reaching British shores onboard 33 boats on 11 November. Despite international efforts to crack down on people smugglers, organised criminal gangs charge thousands of pounds for a berth in flimsy inflatable boats. Dinghies seen leaving French shores and being towed into Dover have increased in size over the past year, with some carrying as many as 50 people. The data shows an average of about 28 people on each small boat that arrived in the UK in 2021, up from just over 13 in 2020. Analysis by Ferrari news agency said last week that 28,381 people had travelled by small boat in 2021. The Home Office collects its own small boat data but refuses to release annual figures, which instead are compiled daily by journalists. The Home Office minister Tom Pursglove said the government was reforming its approach to asylum through its new plan for immigration. “Seeking asylum for protection should not involve people asylum shopping country to country, or risking their lives by lining the pockets of criminal gangs to cross the Channel,” he said. “The nationality and borders bill will make it a criminal offence to knowingly arrive in the UK illegally and introduce life sentences for those who facilitate illegal entry into the country. It will also strengthen the powers of Border Force to stop and redirect vessels, while introducing new powers to remove asylum seekers to have their claims processed outside the UK.”",News/UK news,Calls for safe routes to UK as arrivals by small boat treble in a year,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/04/calls-for-safe-routes-to-uk-as-arrivals-by-small-boat-treble-in-a-year
1/4/2022,"Ministers have greater powers to block foreign takeovers of British firms after new rules came into effect on Tuesday giving them more scope to unpick deals that have the potential to harm national security. The National Security and Investment Act, which enhances existing powers, is described by the government as the “biggest shake-up of the UK’s national security regime for 20 years”.  Ministers have already been able to intervene in deals where a foreign-led takeover could affect economic stability, media plurality, the UK’s pandemic response, or national security. However, the act builds on the government’s ability to deploy the national security rationale for “calling in” a takeover. It identifies 17 areas of the economy that warrant greater scrutiny when overseas investors seek to make an acquisition. In addition to defence and military technology, ministers will be able to examine deals in a wide range of sectors such as advanced robotics, artificial intelligence, the civil nuclear sector, transport and quantum technology. Officials will be notified that a deal is worthy of examination when a buyer takes its stake above three trigger points: 25%, 50% and 75%. The government can block these transactions and even unwind them restrospectively if they were completed on or after 12 November 2020, the day the bill was introduced to parliament. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, said: “The UK is world-renowned as an attractive place to invest but we have always been clear that we will not hesitate to step in where necessary to protect our national security. “The new investment screening process in place from today is simple and quick, giving investors and firms the certainty they need to do business, and giving everyone in the UK the peace of mind that their security remains our number one priority.” The act is viewed by some as a response to concern about Chinese takeovers of strategically important technology businesses, with some of the deals already being pored over by officials under existing rules. They include relatively small deals, such as the sale of the semiconductor manufacturer Newport Wafer Fab to a Dutch company owned by China’s Wingtech, which is partially backed by the state. Newport Wafer Fab has multiple contracts with the UK government, including defence-related projects. The government funding body UK Research and Innovation has suspended grants to the company, while a consortium of British investors is reportedly ready to submit a £300m bid if the deal is blocked. Much larger foreign buyouts by US companies also came under the microscope in 2021, owing to concerns about national security or intellectual property. Takeovers of the defence suppliers Ultra Electronics and Meggitt attracted government scrutiny, as did the $75bn (£56bn) takeover of the world-leading chipmaker Arm by its rival Nvidia – a deal that is the subject of competition investigations in the UK, US and Europe. Plans to expand the government’s remit to examine such deals have divided opinion. It will apply regardless of the size of a company by revenue, or where the prospective acquirer is based, even if it is in the UK. Business groups have warned that the breadth of criteria could result in unnecessary meddling in a large volume of deals, deterring investment in the UK and bogging down officials in needless paperwork. The government has said that while up to 1,800 deals a year would be notifiable under the new powers, fewer than 100 would be called in for a full review. Reviews are intended to last a maximum of 30 days, faster than is typical at the moment, thanks to a new investment screening unit. Kwarteng has also faced criticism, including from the Henry Jackson Society thinktank, for reducing the equity threshold at which deals can be examined from 25% to 15%. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has insisted that the act will not lead to ministers “arbitrarily” intervening in takeovers. “The vast majority of acquisitions will require no intervention and will be able to proceed quickly and with certainty in the knowledge that the government will not revisit a transaction once cleared unless false or misleading information was provided,” the department said on Tuesday.",News/Business,UK government extends powers to intervene in foreign takeovers,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/04/uk-government-extends-powers-to-intervene-in-foreign-takeovers
1/4/2022,"Eyes moist, red mohican sparkling in the lights, scalp painting glistening with sweat, Peter Wright won his second PDC world championship in one of its tensest and most absorbing finals. He did so not by outscoring Michael Smith but by outlasting him, not by blowing him off the board but simply by resisting, holding his nerve and holding his throw against one of the heaviest and most relentless treble-hitters in the sport. As an exhausted Wright celebrated a 7-5 victory, Smith stood at the back of the stage: distraught, disconsolate, destroyed. He looked up at the lights, down at his feet, off to the side. He buried his face in his shirt. He turned and stared at the blue sponsor’s backdrop. Anything to avoid glancing at the Sid Waddell Trophy that was being placed on a plinth in front of him, the trophy that has now twice eluded him at the final hurdle.  He believed it was his time. We all felt it, too. He had beaten the defending champion Gerwyn Price, the dangerous James Wade, the breakthrough star of the year in Jonny Clayton. When he is on song and in rhythm, when the 180s flow from his fingers like piano music, there is barely a player on the planet who can live with him. And perhaps, ultimately, only a player like Wright could have thwarted him. Late in the game Smith was 5-4 up with a break of throw, an advantage that felt decisive. Instead Wright endured, much as he has been enduring his whole career. Darts never came easy to him. Life never came easy to him. Even in his moment of triumph, the boos from an uncharitable Alexandra Palace crowd continued to sting his ears. But here he was, the last man standing and now legitimately one of the greats of the sport. Long before a dart had been thrown in this final, Alexandra Palace was already a heaving hive of fervour and festivity, as grown men bellowed their viral load across the Palm Court arena and the old songs were revived with relish. You were reminded again just what a befuddling challenge it must be to throw pinpoint darts in this environment, amid the pounding music and the hollering of the referee and the ambient smell of lager and takeaway. Many wither on the big stage. For those who succeed, it must be akin to performing open heart surgery on a nightclub dancefloor. But both men had been here before. Wright had broken his duck by winning the title two years earlier, and at 51 years of age was somewhere near the peak of his powers. An introvert dressed as an extrovert, Wright is a creature of paradoxes and contradictions: the showman with a chronic shyness, the court jester who throws with a sniper’s precision, the relentlessly consistent scorer who changes his darts between tournaments, between matches, sometimes even – as here – in the fifth set of a world championship final. Three years earlier, Smith had been demolished on this stage by Michael van Gerwen, breaking a hand midway through after punching a door in frustration. And for a while it felt like the experience might be a terminal one. His scoring had always been peerless. But in times of stress the arm would tense and the doubles would drift. As if he couldn’t quite take the final step. As if he was finally being forced to contemplate what it meant to win. Such was the fate that befell him here. He has now reached seven major televised finals, and lost the lot. The action was as loose and easy as ever, but the body language looked a little strained, the gaze a little pained. The canny Wright was taking his time between visits, forcing Smith to think as much as possible. The contrast between them was stark. Smith flings his darts as if they’re laughing emojis: one, two, three, who cares? Wright, by contrast, throws them as if he’s trying to construct the three parts of a perfect sentence. The first two sets were scrappy, and Wright won them both. But as Smith settled, his sheer weight of scoring began to impose itself. He swung himself back into the match with a sumptuous 167 checkout. Two-all became 3-3 became 4-4 became 5-5. One hour became two. Even the crowd seemed to tighten a little, as if aware that the time for frivolity had passed. On the stage, both players were betraying barely a flicker of tension or nerves, even as they knew – as we all did – that they were fooling absolutely nobody. And finally it was Smith who cracked, missing a crucial bullseye to hold throw in the 12th set. Wright checked out 81 for a 12-dart finish, and before long the last rites were being administered. Smith had recorded a higher average (99 to 98). He had hit 24 180s to Wright’s 17. But as the old truism goes, darts is not simply a game of scoring but of timing. And as Smith blinked into the Palace lights, pyrotechnics lighting his face, he could be forgiven for wondering when his time might come again.",Sport/Sport,Peter Wright edges out Smith to win second PDC world championship,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/03/peter-wright-edges-out-michael-smith-to-secure-second-world-darts-title
