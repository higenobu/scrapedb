2/10/2022,"Anti-Jewish hate incidents have hit a record high in the UK, with reports of antisemitism in person and online rising above the previous 2019 peak after conflict erupted between Israel and Palestinians last May. The Community Security Trust (CST), a charity that monitors antisemitism, recorded 2,255 incidents last year including a surge in people shouting abuse from passing cars as well as 173 violent assaults. It is the highest annual tally of antisemitic hatred CST has ever recorded and is a 34% increase from the 1,684 incidents recorded in 2020.  The biggest surge coincided with the bloody conflict in the Middle East in May. Incidents involving schools, pupils and teachers hit a new high, more than tripling the number in 2020. There was a similar rise in incidents among students and academics, with the highest volume of university-related hate ever recorded – and half of it happening in May 2021. Jewish people in Manchester and London endured 155 antisemitic incidents involving people shouting abuse from passing vehicles, more than half of which happened in May and June. Hundreds of Palestinians and 13 people in Israel were killed as Israel carried out airstrikes in Gaza and Hamas fired rockets into Israel. More than a third of all the UK incidents involved language, imagery or behaviour that referenced the conflict in the Middle East or demonstrated anti-Zionist motivation alongside antisemitism. The home secretary, Priti Patel, described the figures as “shocking”, while the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said the new record was “truly appalling”. The government’s independent adviser on antisemitism, the peer John Mann, said it was time to “reconsider our efforts to tackle antisemitism”. “These record levels of anti-Jewish racism, reported by our Jewish community to CST and police, show how difficult last year was for Jews across Britain,” said Mark Gardner, the chief executive of CST, which also provides security for Jewish people and properties. “These hatreds boil away, taking any excuse to publicly burst out against Jews. This is exactly what happened during and after the Israel-Gaza war of May 2021, from schools and universities, through to the carloads of people who repeatedly drove to Jewish areas and yelled vile abuse at anyone who looked Jewish.” The report provides images of antisemitic graffiti in Tower Hamlets about “Zionist military police” and “mind control”, a candelabra to celebrate the festival of Hanukah smashed to the ground in Camden and graffiti on a pavement in Gateshead that read “Fuck Jews”. There was a decrease in online hate overall, possibly because of a fall in the number of incidents related to the Labour party. CST said it previously recorded surges in online antisemitic vitriol from people who felt allegations of antisemitism in the party were manufactured by the wider Jewish community to smear the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. There was also evidence of Covid-related antisemitism with leaflets distributed to homes in South Yorkshire saying “Don’t trust the Jew jab” and other similar slurs. A total of 78 incidents were related to the pandemic – from conspiracy theories about Jewish involvement in creating and spreading Covid-19 or the “myth” of Covid-19, to wishing that Jewish people caught the virus and died from it. Some reports related to the misappropriation of Holocaust imagery such as the yellow Star of David as part of anti-lockdown or anti-vaccine campaigns. Racists also found a new way to spread their hate. There were 16 reports of “Zoombombings” – video conferencing events being hijacked with antisemitic material during 2021. The conflict in the Middle East coincided with the easing of Covid-19 restrictions in the UK, which CST said may have fuelled the spike in hate incidents. In May businesses were allowed to reopen, most legal controls on outdoor socialising were lifted and two households were able to meet indoors. “It is possible that the relaxing of regulations, coinciding with a trigger event as emotive as renewed war between Israel and Hamas, provided the opportunity and impetus for a mass release of lockdown-induced frustrations,” the report said. “These factors may have played a part in the extent of the rise in antisemitic incident reports during and in the aftermath of this period.” Patel said: “Our Jewish community has been subject to appalling hatred … In addition to supporting the work of CST, I continue to support the police to ensure they have the resources to tackle these despicable incidents so that perpetrators can then be punished with the full force of the law.” Cooper said the increasing number of incidents “shows just how far we have to go to remove the stain of antisemitism from our society”. “We need urgent action to tackle these vile incidents wherever they arise, be it in schools, on our streets or online,” she said. “Hatred is unacceptable in all its forms, and it is our responsibility to stamp it out once and for all.”",News/News,Anti-Jewish hate incidents hit record high in UK,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/10/anti-jewish-hate-incidents-hit-record-high-in-uk
2/10/2022,"Having devoted his life to the conundrums of the cosmos, Prof Stephen Hawking has left behind a mystery of his own amid the eclectic contents of his former office. The Cambridge cosmologist, who died in 2018 at the age of 76, treasured a blackboard that became smothered with cartoons, doodles and equations at a conference he arranged in 1980. But what all the graffiti and in-jokes mean is taking some time to unravel.  The blackboard – as much a perplexing work of art as a memento from the history of physics – goes on display for the first time on Thursday as part of a collection of office items acquired by the Science Museum in London. The hope for Juan-Andres Leon, the curator of Stephen Hawking’s office, is that surviving attenders of the conference on superspace and supergravity held in Cambridge more than 40 years ago swing by and explain what some of the sketches and comments mean. “We’ll certainly try and extract their interpretations,” Leon said. Joining the blackboard in a temporary display called Stephen Hawking at Work is a rare copy of the physicist’s 1966 PhD thesis, his wheelchair, a formal bet that information swallowed by a black hole is lost for ever, and a host of celebrity memorabilia, including a personalised jacket given to him by the creators of the Simpsons for his many appearances on the show. “People don’t have much of a glimpse into what everyday life was like for Stephen Hawking, and because he was a theoretical physicist, it’s hard to convey what he might do on a random Monday,” said Leon. “The office provides a lot of material and I think people knew that this was more than the collection of its parts, that it really reflects what made Stephen Hawking unique,” he added. The display contains only a fraction of the 700-plus items that staff at the Science Museum have sorted through since they arrived last summer. In time, all will be photographed and described online for all to see. Hawking’s academic work is portrayed through a handful of key works all written before his ascent to stardom in 1988. For his PhD thesis, Hawking took the process that forms a black hole – the cataclysmic collapse of a star – and ran it backwards, showing that the universe must explode into being from a single point in space and time. “Hawking used black holes as instruments, using them to understand even bigger things,” said Leon. In further work, Hawking showed that black holes are not so black after all, shedding radiation into space until they evaporate into nothing. Among the more unusual objects is a small glass apple – a gift from researchers at Intel and a nod to Hawking’s position as Lucasian professor, a post formerly held by Sir Isaac Newton. The ornament has been painted to evoke the cosmic microwave background, the afterglow of the big bang. Hawking described the tiny fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background – irregularities in the early universe that later formed the stars and galaxies – as the “fingerprints of creation”. His gift for a grand metaphor delighted publishers and led more than a few readers to see proof of divine intervention. The display does not attempt to exaggerate Hawking’s standing – according to Leon, most physicists would say he was “very good”, a “contender for a Nobel prize”, but not “the most revolutionary genius since Einstein”. What it does attempt to do is portray a sense of Hawking as a physicist, a wit and a celebrity. “We didn’t want the display to be solemn, all heavy with trombones and swirling galaxies and things like that. We wanted it to be playful,” said Leon. “He didn’t take things too seriously and I don’t think he’d have been such a celebrity if he didn’t have that spark of fun about him.” The Stephen Hawking at Work display is free and will run until 12 June at the Science Museum in London before moving to the Science and Industry Museum in Manchester, with further stops at the National Science and Media Museum in Bradford, the National Railway Museum in York and Locomotion in Shildon, County Durham.",News/Science,Stephen Hawking exhibition hopes to unravel the mysteries of his blackboard,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/10/stephen-hawking-exhibition-hopes-to-unravel-the-mysteries-of-his-blackboard
2/10/2022,"Students in England are being hit by stealth cuts and tax rises by a government which is using high inflation to “quietly tighten the financial screws”, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). The IFS paper highlights a series of ways in which inflation is eroding the value of student loans and tuition fees, enabling the government to claw back money from students and universities to the tune of £2.3bn.  The report, published on Thursday, comes at a time of concern about the impact of the cost of living crisis on already hard-up students and uncertainty about the future of higher education funding. According to the IFS thinktank, students will see substantial real-terms cuts to the value of maintenance loans, with the parental earnings threshold frozen at £25,000 when it should have risen to £34,000, meaning many students are not receiving full maintenance loans. In addition, the IFS says the rate at which the level of maintenance loans will be increased – at 2.3% – falls short of both the current level of inflation and predicted levels for the year ahead. “This means that many students will see their maintenance loans cut in real terms, even though the real value of their parents’ incomes will also have fallen,” the report said. The IFS also highlighted the recent government decision to freeze the student loan repayment threshold at £27,295 rather than applying the current rate of inflation, so that a graduate earning £30,000 will need to pay £113 more towards their student loan in the next tax year than originally agreed. Tuition fees meanwhile remain frozen for the fifth year at £9,250 which amounts to a 15% real-terms cut in the level of tuition fees over the past decade, the IFS said, hitting university income hard. “On the whole, as our updated student finance calculator shows, the government is saving £2.3bn on student loans under the cover of high inflation,” the IFS paper concluded. Matt Western, Labour’s universities minister, said: “The Conservative party’s cost of living crisis is hitting people’s pockets, yet the government’s response is to raise taxes on working people, introduce a buy now pay later energy scheme, and use a smokescreen to hammer students and graduates.” Ben Waltmann, senior research economist at the IFS, said: “The government seems determined to use high inflation as a cover for reducing the taxpayer cost of student loans. Large real-terms cuts in maintenance loans could cause genuine hardship for students on tight budgets. A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Our student finance system was designed to ensure those from the poorest families get the most support whilst they study. Those students currently have access to the largest ever amounts of living costs support in cash terms and we have increased maximum loans for living costs over the last two years. “The student loan system needs to be fairer for both students and the taxpayer. With graduate salaries rising it is only fair to ask borrowers who are benefiting financially from their higher education make a reasonable contribution towards its costs.” Another education report meanwhile, also published on Thursday, has confirmed that the gap between poorer pupils’ GCSE grades and those of their wealthier peers has failed to improve over the last 10 years. The Education and Policy Institute found however that fears that the switch to teacher assessed grades for GCSEs in 2020 would penalise disadvantaged students were unfounded, though the grade gap widened in 2020 for students in college and sixth form as A-level students gaining a grade more from teacher assessments than those who studied BTecs which more disadvantaged students take.",News/Education,Ministers ‘quietly tighten financial screws’ on students in England – IFS,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/10/ministers-quietly-tighten-financial-screws-on-students-in-england-ifs
2/10/2022,"Wealth taxes will be needed to fund a £76bn a year increase in government spending by the end of the decade, caused by an ageing population and more expensive healthcare, a thinktank has said. The Resolution Foundation said the UK was on course to see the size of the state match that of Germany by 2030, and warned new methods of raising money to pay for higher spending would be needed.  While stressing public spending pressures were nothing new for Britain, the thinktank said previous ways of raising money – such as reducing defence spending and raising national insurance contributions – would no longer be feasible. It predicted the government’s pension bill would rise by £24bn a year because the baby boomer generation would be retiring and people would be living longer. Extra pressures on the NHS resulting from demographic change would cost an additional £52bn. As a result, public spending would rise to 44% of the economy’s gross domestic product, up from 42% currently. Germany’s public spending pre-Covid was 45% of GDP. The Resolution Foundation said it was vital to avoid a repeat of the period after the financial crash, when slow growth drastically reduced tax revenues. It concluded that wealth – which had grown from three times national income in the early 1980s to eight times currently – was under-taxed. Dan Tomlinson, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “The swift demographic change that Britain will experience in the 2020s alongside rising health costs is set to increase public spending by £76bn a year. We’ll all benefit from people living longer, healthier lives – as well as reducing our carbon footprint – but it will have to be paid for. Tomlinson said that over the past seven decades, the UK has expanded the NHS, the state pension and education spending, and managed those costs by shrinking the army and growing the size of the state on the back of higher national insurance contributions. “We’re unlikely to be able to simply repeat that approach in future,” he said. “We’ll need to tax income more efficiently and fairly, and find new sources of tax revenue such as from better taxing wealth.”",News/Business,"Tax wealth to pay for ageing UK population, says thinktank",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/10/tax-wealth-to-pay-for-ageing-uk-population-says-thinktank
2/10/2022,"The extremist Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene triggered a wave of viral jokes on Wednesday after ranting about the “gazpacho police” patrolling the Capitol building in Washington DC. Greene was apparently mixing up the famously cold Spanish soup gazpacho with the Gestapo – the brutal Nazi-era secret police in Germany.  The Georgia congresswoman has made numerous bigoted statements and her spreading of Covid misinformation has seen her ousted from Twitter. She made the most recent comments in an interview on Real America with Dan Ball, produced by the rightwing One America News Network television channel. “Not only do we have the DC jail which is the DC gulag, but now we have Nancy Pelosi’s gazpacho police spying on members of Congress, spying on the legislative work that we do, spying on our staff and spying on American citizens,” she said, referring to the Democratic speaker of the House. Greene did not explain why she thought Pelosi would form a police force inspired by gazpacho soup, nor why it would then carry out such extensive surveillance at the heart of American democracy. Predictably, Greene’s apparent gaffe prompted a wave of internet hilarity and jokes. “Gazpacho is a cold tomato soup. Gestapo is the Nazi police force. Neither of these things are right,” tweeted political journalist Jake Sherman. “How dare MTG blame Gazpacho, when we all know that Vichyssoise Violence is the real culprit,” quipped podcast host Emily Brandwin. Sarakshi Rai, a senior journalist at the Hill, added: “I was wondering why everybody in DC was tweeting about gazpacho and now I’m just craving some for dinner.”",News/US news,‘Gazpacho police’: Nazi gaffe lands Republican congresswoman in the soup,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/09/marjorie-taylor-greene-gazpacho-police
2/10/2022,"Energy giant AGL has accelerated the closure date of its two biggest coal-fired power plants by several years, responding to a market shift towards renewable sources of electricity.In an earnings statement on Thursday to the ASX, the soon-to-be-demerged energy company said its underlying first-half profit after tax fell 40.9% to $194m compared with a year earlier. Revenue rose 5% to $5.713bn. The main interest for many, though, will be the acceleration of the closure plans for AGL’s Hunter Valley-based Bayswater black coal-fired power station in New South Wales to “no later than” 2033 from its previously scheduled demise of 2035, while its brown coal-fired Loy Yang A plant in Victoria will now close by 2045 rather than 2048.  The timing of the closures, though, will depend on “the readiness of the entire energy system to operate without our critical baseload generation”, the company said. Market forces, though, may decide on a much earlier closure date than these revised schedules. The company gives a nod to that, providing “closure windows” of 2030-33 for Bayswater and 2040-45 for Loy Yang A. Worries about energy shortages have lately pushed up the cost of coal and gas globally, some of which has begun affecting wholesale power prices in Australia despite the falling share of fossil-fuel sources in the main national market. Wind, solar and hydro plants, whose energy costs are nearly free, generated almost a third of the electricity for eastern states in 2021. One of Australia’s oldest companies, AGL generates about one-fifth of the National Electricity Market’s power, with about 11,000 megawatts of capacity. By the end of this financial year, it plans to split into two, with most of the generation units going into its Accel Energy spin-off, and the retailing arm to make up AGL Australia. AGL’s Liddell plant, also in the Hunter, remains on track to close in April 2023, soon after the NSW state elections in March. AGL said the timetable would lop emissions by 18-27% during the 2025-2045 period, compared with 2019 levels. Over the 2035-2046 period, those emissions would be 55-60% lower. But Greenpeace Australia dismissed AGL’s amended schedule for Loy Yang A and Bayswater as a “token effort”. “AGL doesn’t even get a golf clap for its timid token effort in delaying the closure timeline for Loy Yang A, Australia’s worst-polluting coal-burning power station, to 2045,” said Glenn Walker, a senior campaigner at Greenpeace Australia Pacific. “In delaying Loy Yang A and Bayswater’s inevitable closure, AGL is putting worker and investor security, as well as the climate, at serious risk,” Walker said. “Loy Yang A and its attached brown coalmine pump out over 20m tonnes of climate pollution every year,” he said. “Keeping this brown-coal blight on our climate open until 2045 will produce a further 460m tonnes of toxic emissions, equivalent to the [annual] pollution from over 100m cars, putting Australia’s chance at a safer climate future in jeopardy.” In a sign that pressure to force Accel to speed up the plant closures is unlikely to abate, Dan Gocher, director of climate and environment at the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, said the timetable ignored “the majority of its shareholders with its failure to align the closure of its coal-fired power stations with the Paris agreement”. “Just five months ago, 53% of AGL shareholders supported a motion calling for Paris-aligned targets for both demerged entities,” Gocher said. “The AGL board has manifestly failed to heed that message.” The updated plan “is next to meaningless for these crumbling assets: in 2033, Bayswater will be 48 years old, and in 2045, Loy Yang A will be 61 years old”, he said. “AGL is facing increasing sustaining capital expenditure on its coal-fired power stations (up $17m to $162m), while it steadfastly refuses to invest in the transition, with growth and transformation capital expenditure declining (down $18m to $62m),” Gocher said. The federal energy minister, Angus Taylor, though, did not welcome the earlier closure times, saying the closure windows “leave a considerable gap of close to 5000MW of reliable generation in the National Electricity Market”. “While this announcement is a commercial decision and AGL has complied with the minimum 3.5-year notice period, the exit of such a considerable amount of reliable generation is a concern for the continued reliability and affordability of the system,” Taylor said. “Delivery of new, timely, replacement dispatchable capacity will be critical in keeping prices low and the lights on,” he said. AGL’s shares were up as much as 3% in early trade on the ASX, before paring the gains. Nicholas Chapman, vice president, Moody’s Investors Service, said the weak half-year results were in line with market expectations and rising wholesale energy prices were likely to “stabilise” the company’s performance. “However, the improved near-term outlook is overshadowed by persistent longer term challenges, including the continued entry of low cost renewables and structurally lower consumer energy demand,” Chapman said. “In addition, the company’s planned demerger of its retail business in the face of [environmental, social and government] pressures will reduce diversification and increase its exposure to carbon transition risk.”",News/Australia news,AGL brings forward closure date of two largest coal-fired power plants as market shifts to renewables,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/10/agl-brings-forward-closure-date-of-two-largest-coal-fired-power-plants-as-market-shifts-to-renewables

I’m Rafqa Touma, filling in for Guardian Australia’s lifestyle editor, Alyx Gorman. If you are after breaking news, check out the Guardian Australia live blog. If not, I’m glad you’re sticking around. Today we take a trip to New York City, recap the Brit awards, and find a funny-shaped tree frog in a Queensland shower.  The National Press Club hosted Grace Tame and Brittany Higgins for a joint address on Wednesday. With sharp and damning words, the 2021 Australian of the Year and the Liberal staffer who triggered parliament’s #MeToo reckoning put politicians on notice. Guardian Australia’s political editor, Katharine Murphy, shares some key highlights. Notable quote: “Last year wasn’t a march for acknowledgment,” Higgins said. “It wasn’t a march for coverage. It wasn’t a march for language. It was a march for justice. And that justice demands real change in our laws, as well as in our language, in our national culture, as well as our national conversation. That starts with the prime minister – yes, some of his language last year was shocking and, at times, admittedly, a bit offensive. But his words wouldn’t matter if his actions had measured up. Then, or since … I didn’t want his sympathy as a father. I wanted him to use his power as prime minister.” Further reading: Grace Tame claims she received a “threatening phone call” in August last year warning her not to criticise the prime minister, Scott Morrison. Ed Sheeran turns screamo, performing his hit Bad Habits with British metallers Bring Me the Horizon. While Adele performed I Drink Wine, cross legged on a piano.

It is also an excellent source of protein, vitamins (A, B2, B12), and minerals (phosphorus, potassium, zinc, iodine). But, for a number of reasons, many people don’t drink cow’s milk. (I personally opt for soy, although I hear potato milk is on its way.) And while experts say “drinking milk in moderation in line with recommendation” is the way to go, there is good news for the milk-avoiders. You can get the calcium and nutrients you need from other foods. Here’s how. What products should I add to the shopping list? Tofu, canned fish with bones, green leafy vegetables, nuts, seeds, cheese, yoghurt and calcium-fortified plant milks. If any Australians are looking to make a dramatic move to New York City, be warned. Its rental market is dire. The Guardian has a whole series to prove it. Today, Kathryn Lindsay writes on StreetEasy, the “Amazon for real estate”. The real estate site is easy to filter and use, hosts every listing in the city, and is there for every part of the renting or buying process – from shopping around to the moment a new key-holder walks through the door of a new home. Notable quote: “StreetEasy might as well be the city’s entire real estate business … But as StreetEasy has revolutionised the city’s real estate, its success hasn’t gone unchallenged. As is the case when a company disrupts a market, winners and losers abound – and sometimes trade places in the process.” How long will it take to read? About three minutes.

There, using a teaspoon to pry open the frog’s mouth, the dart (which was about the same length as the frog’s body) was successfully removed.

2/10/2022,"Uber’s food delivery service Uber Eats has turned profitable for the first time, the company said Wednesday, in an earnings report that revealed it may be bouncing back after a rough run during lockdown. Shares rose 6.8% in after-hours trading after the company’s report showed $5.8bn in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2021, beating estimates of $5.36bn. It said demand for its ride-hailing service was again approaching pre-pandemic levels.  “In Q4, more consumers were active on our platform than ever before,” said Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber’s chief executive officer, in a statement. Still, Uber forecast lower-than-expected adjusted profit in the first three months of 2022, as the Omicron coronavirus variant dampened travel demand in January. Lyft, Uber’s main rival in the US, issued a similar warning on Tuesday. In its own earnings, Lyft also reported an upward recovery trajectory tempered by the Omicron surge. It said per-rider revenue reached nearly $52 in the fourth quarter – a 13.5% increase from the third quarter and the highest amount in the company’s nearly 10-year history. While riders continued returning to Lyft compared with 2020 levels, ridership in the fourth quarter decreased by roughly 1% versus the prior quarter and ridership remains 30% below pre-Covid levels. Uber forecast its first-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), a measure that excludes one-time costs, primarily stock-based compensation, to come in between $100m and $130m. The company said business had started picking up into February. “Our results demonstrate just how far we’ve come since the beginning of the pandemic,” Khosrowshahi said, adding that the company may also be bouncing back from the recent wave of Covid infections, with gross bookings up 25% month-on-month in the most recent week. Uber’s delivery unit, largely made up of its Uber Eats restaurant service, posted its first adjusted EBITDA profit of $25m, showing Uber’s ability to scale the once loss-making operation against strong competition. Delivery emerged as one of the company’s main strengths during the pandemic. Steady delivery bookings signal that the rebound in rides has not come at the expense of food delivery, with consumers sticking to the service even as the economy reopens. The California-based company reported adjusted EBITDA of $86m for the quarter that ended on 31 December. That compared with a loss on the same basis of $454m a year ago and was significantly ahead of analyst expectations for $62.03m in the fourth quarter. Uber also posted net income of $892m, as it revalued its stakes in Southeast-Asian Grab and self-driving company Aurora Innovation, just a quarter after it reported a $2.42bn net loss driven by its stake in Chinese ride service Didi and stock-based compensation.

2/10/2022,"“At EnergyAustralia, we’re already building Australia’s first carbon offset power station,” says a smiling tradie in hi-vis overlooking a construction site. The line is from EnergyAustralia’s new TV ad that has been appearing in prime time slots accompanied by Fleetwood Mac’s 1977 classic tune, Don’t Stop.  The company said the ad campaign would showcase “how the leading energy retailer and generator is supporting cleaner, affordable and reliable energy.” But what is a “carbon offset power station” anyway and is it different from any other power station? The power station in question – Tallawarra B – is under construction near Wollongong in New South Wales and will be a fast-start plant that will burn gas and, as the ad said, be “hydrogen-capable”. But in reality, what EnergyAustralia is doing in building a “carbon offset power station” is constructing a regular fossil fuel power station, then working out what the emissions are, and then buying some carbon offsets. To understand how unimpressive this is, think about how you could make the same claim about anything else you chose to construct like, for example, a diesel generator. As long as you know its emissions, you can magically turn it into a “carbon offset diesel generator” through the purchase of carbon credits. “Offsetting should only be used as a last resort, and not to justify projects that should be avoided,” said Dr Megan Evans, an expert in environmental offsets at the University of New South Wales in Canberra. “This is an inappropriate use of offsetting, but it is increasingly being used as a first resort, rather than a last resort,” she said. EnergyAustralia told Temperature Check it would buy government-accredited Australian Carbon Credit Units for its offsets. But Evans said any benefits from buying offsets tended not to be realised until many years into the future, whereas burning gas in a power station releases emissions immediately. “We need to be cutting emissions now to stay within carbon budgets, rather than starting in the future.” What about adding hydrogen to the gas at Tallawarra B. Will that make it less polluting? EnergyAustralia said the power station was designed to accept gas mixed with 5% “green hydrogen” by volume. Dr Fiona Beck, an expert in the emerging hydrogen economy at the Australian National University, said adding this much zero-emissions hydrogen would only reduce emissions from the plant by about 1.6%. As this column has explored before, some experts say using zero-emissions hydrogen in the power sector is likely to be one of the least economical uses of the liquid fuel. An EnergyAustralia statement said the company would “offer to buy 200,000kg of green hydrogen for 10 years from 2025” and would investigate adding more hydrogen to the mix in the future. The “residual” emissions from the power station would then be offset, the company said. Taking Beck’s analysis, those “residual emissions” will be about 98.4% of them. In the 45 second TV ad, a staff member makes a bold signoff. After walking over the MCG turf, the staff member says: “while others just talk about making a better tomorrow, we’re actually doing it.” EnergyAustralia launched its advertising campaign the same week it was ranked 47th out of 50 in a Greenpeace “green electricity” guide. According to data from the Clean Energy Regulator, EnergyAustralia is the second highest corporate emitter of greenhouse gases in the country, releasing 17.9m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2019-20. Glenn Walker, senior campaigner at Greenpeace Australia Pacific, said the company was ranked so low because of its high annual emissions and because the company mines coal and plans to keep burning it until 2040. “EnergyAustralia talks about building a better tomorrow, but this is just blatant greenwashing,” Walker said. “The ‘tomorrow’ they’re most contributing to is one of climate chaos.” EnergyAustralia said the Tallawarra B “sets a new benchmark for how gas generators can be consistent with NSW’s plan to be net zero by 2050 by using green hydrogen and offsetting residual emissions”. The company was committed to being net zero by 2050, “to be out of coal by 2040, and to reduce our direct emissions by 60% by 2028-29 relative to 2019-20”. The company had announced the early retirement of its Yallourn brown coal power station and had made commitments to pumped hydro, battery and gas projects “designed to enable more renewables to enter the system”. “We are focused on a smooth energy transition for all, made possible through respectful and responsible actions,” EnergyAustralia said. A central plank of the information that energy companies routinely announce to investors is how much fossil fuels they have in their reserves. But this week oil and gas company Santos added another metric to their “annual reserves statement” – the amount of CO2 storage capacity the company has on its books. The company’s managing director, Kevin Gallagher, announced it had listed 100m tonnes of CO2 storage which related to its $220m Moomba carbon capture and storage project in the Cooper Basin in South Australia. “This globally significant carbon storage capacity booking is another tangible example of Santos leading the way in establishing the foundations to support the energy transition,” Gallagher said. Temperature Check understands the 100m tonnes of storage relates to the annual 1.7m tonne capacity of its planned Moomba project – meaning it would take 59 years to fill. Even though Santos has “booked” the storage, the company has only stored 100 tonnes of CO2 during a trial, with the first injection into the Moomba CCS project not scheduled until the first half of 2024. Santos also reported that thanks mainly to a merger with another energy firm, its “proved plus probable” reserves had gone up by 80% to stand at the equivalent of 1,676m barrels of oil. Experts at Climate Analytics – a respected not-for-profit climate science and policy consultancy – told Temperature Check that if sold and burned, those reserves would release about 512m tonnes of CO2. Santos has insisted its business plans won’t compromise its target to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. That target excludes the emissions from the fossil fuels that are burned after the company has sold them.",News/Environment,Can you really carbon offset a power station?
