2/24/2022,"Doctors have accused Sadiq Khan of betraying his commitment to view pollution as a social justice issue, as they handed in a letter to his office calling for him to cancel a major new road tunnel. The Silvertown tunnel will pass beneath the Thames between Newham and Woolwich, two of London’s most deprived riverside boroughs. Experts say it will massively increase air pollution faced by some of the capital’s poorest people.  Holes have already been dug either side of the river and components for the boring machine, which will dig the four-lane tunnel, are being transported to the northern end, with drilling due to begin this spring. According to TfL estimates, it will cost about £2bn over 30 years, making it Khan’s biggest infrastructure project as mayor of London. On Thursday morning, doctors gathered in their scrubs at the Greater London authority’s new headquarters in Newham, where they handed in a letter, signed by 125 health workers, telling Khan there was “no excuse” not to cancel the tunnel. Silvertown, the letter said, would “funnel traffic, including heavy freight vehicles, into areas of deprivation which already suffer disproportionately from so many adverse social determinants of health. “You, as mayor of London, have the power to cancel the Silvertown tunnel. There is no excuse not to. It makes no sense and is a health and environmental hazard. We urge you to put a stop to it, to invest the money in projects that will benefit people’s health and reap the rewards of savings to the NHS that such beneficial policies would bring.” The action came exactly a week after the mayor had convened a summit on clean air in London’s capital, where he had said it was the poorest Londoners, least likely to own a car, who suffered the most from air pollution. “For me the issue is very simple: it’s one of social justice,” he said. Dr Jackie Appleby, who helped coordinate the letter, said she could not see how Khan could reconcile his position on pollution and social justice with building the tunnel. “The Silvertown tunnel is completely contrary to his position,” the Newham GP said. “If he really thinks that air pollution is a social justice issue he needs to stop the Silvertown tunnel – end of. Because there is no doubt that that tunnel is going to bring more pollution into Newham. “Kids in Newham already have lungs that are 10% smaller than kids who live in less polluted parts of the country, and we also have 40,000 excess deaths a year from air pollution across the UK. We don’t know how many of those are in Newham but there will be a disproportionate number of them, obviously, because air pollution is higher. “So we’re hoping he’s going to reconsider [and] actually think about investing the money in more healthy options.” Last June, a report from the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, backed by some of the UK’s leading climate scientists, found that the development was incompatible with the Greater London authority’s aim to become carbon-neutral by 2030. The Guardian has contacted the mayor’s office for comment.",News/Politics,Doctors urge Sadiq Khan to cancel Silvertown tunnel over pollution fears,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/24/doctors-urge-sadiq-khan-cancel-london-silvertown-tunnel-pollution
2/24/2022,"Oil and gas prices surged on Thursday and global stock markets fell sharply after Russian forces invaded Ukraine. Brent crude hit $105 a barrel for the first time since August 2014, following a rise of more than 8% on international energy markets. The increase signalled a further rise on garage forecourts to record-breaking retail price for unleaded petrol of more than £1.55 a litre.  The price of British gas for next-day delivery jumped 40% to £280 per therm as the invasion stoked fears of a disruption to global energy supplies. There was a broad sell-off of shares across Europe, and banks with big operations in Russia were especially hard hit following moves by governments across the continent and in the UK to impose sanctions on Russian banks and wealthy Russian individuals. The FTSE 100 in London fell almost 250 points to 7,257, or 3.2%, by late morning on Thursday, while Germany’s DAX, France’s CAC and Italy’s FTSE MIB were all down 5%, while Russia’s MOEX plunged 33% when trading was resumed following a temporary suspension. Thirty-one Russian companies are traded on the London Stock Exchange. State-owned banks Sberbank and VTB, along with state-backed oil and gas producers Gazprom and Rosneft have secondary listings in the UK while their primary listings remain in Moscow. Sberbank lost 75% of its value and VTB fell almost 22%. Gazprom, the mainly state-owned Russian energy company that trades some of its shares in London, was down 36%. Rosneft, the oil major which is 20%-owned by BP, dropped 23% and Lukoil has down nearly 44%. The Anglo-Russian miner Polymetal was the top faller on the FTSE 100, down 37%, with the Russian mining group Evraz in second place, down nearly 30%. Russ Mould, investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, said the London exchange fell less than other European bourses due to the large weighting towards the energy sector. He said oil giants BP and Shell stand to benefit from the surge in oil prices through $100 a barrel. Russia is the world’s second-largest oil producer and sells most of its crude to European refineries. It is also the largest supplier of natural gas to Europe, providing about 35% of its supply. Oil prices have surged more than $20 a barrel since the start of 2022 as the Ukraine crisis continued to be unresolved, with fears that the US and Europe would impose sanctions on Russia’s energy sector, disrupting supplies, should the situation escalate. The benchmark Dutch gas futures price gained as much as 41% to €125 per megawatt hour, the highest level since just before Christmas, according to Bloomberg, half the cost charged to households and businesses in the UK. Meanwhile, German power for March delivery soared as much as 31%, reaching €260 per megawatt hour. Mould warned that the surge in the oil price was “terrible news for businesses and consumers”, and would serve to further stoke inflation. “Not only will energy bills keep going up, but food prices look set to jump even higher. Ukraine and Russia are both big food suppliers and any disruption to supplies will force buyers to seek alternative sources, which could jack up prices. “Investor sentiment was already fragile because of rising inflation and the upwards direction of travel for interest rates, but confirmation of war and the associated alarming news headlines around the world are likely to see equity markets go through a difficult period for longer than people might have previously expected.” Russia and Ukraine are also large producers of metals, which analysts said could be in short supply over the coming months unless the war ends quickly. Russia produces 6% of the world’s aluminium, and 7% of its mined nickel. The three-month aluminium price on the London Metal Exchange jumped to an all-time high of $3,443 a tonne, and later traded 4.2% higher at $3,428.5. Nickel climbed 3.4% to $25,220 a tonne, after hitting its highest level since May 2011 t $25,240. Soni Kumari, an analyst at Melbourne-based ANZ bank, said: “Aluminium and nickel are energy intensive metals and higher energy prices would further push the cost curve. This raises risk of more European smelters suspending their production or postponing their restart plans.” ",News/Business,Energy prices surge as Russian invasion of Ukraine stokes fears of global shortages,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/24/gas-and-oil-prices-surge-amid-fears-of-global-energy-shortage-russia-ukraine
2/24/2022,"Boris Johnson has warned that “a vast invasion is under way, by land, by sea and by air” in Ukraine, as he promised “massive” sanctions that would “hobble” the Russian economy. Speaking as world leaders scrambled to respond to the incursions that began in the early hours of the morning, the prime minister said Vladimir Putin had, “attacked a friendly country without any provocation and without any credible excuse”, and must not be allowed to succeed.  “Diplomatically, politically, economically, and eventually militarily, this hideous and barbaric adventure of Vladimir Putin must end in failure.” Ukraine had for decades been a free country, able to determine its own destiny, he said. “We and the world cannot allow that freedom just to be snuffed out. We cannot and will not just look away,” he said. “This act of wanton and reckless aggression is an attack not just on Ukraine. It is an attack on democracy and freedom in eastern Europe and around the world.” He called for the west to end its dependence on Russian oil and gas as part of its response to the crisis. Oil and gas prices have rocketed in response to the attacks. Johnson delivered the televised statement following a meeting of the government’s emergency Cobra committee at 7.30am. He is expected to join a meeting of G7 leaders later, before addressing MPs at 5pm to set out details of the sanctions package. Johnson faced criticism from across the political spectrum earlier this week for introducing a package of sanctions many MPs, including in his own party, felt were too weak. The chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Tom Tugendhat, suggested the limited sanctions announced on Monday may have “encouraged” the Russian president. “What that did, I’m afraid, was it didn’t deter, but encouraged, because it gave the suggestion or made clear that we weren’t wiling to do anything serious,” he told the BBC’s Today Programme. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, had earlier summoned Russia’s ambassador to explain what she called “Russia’s illegal, unprovoked attack on Ukraine”.",News/World news,Boris Johnson promises massive sanctions to ‘hobble’ Russian economy,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/boris-johnson-promises-massive-sanctions-to-hobble-russian-economy
2/24/2022,"Nine million low income families will be £500 a year worse off on average after the planned below-inflation increase in universal credit and other means-tested benefits are introduced in April, experts say. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) said setting benefit rises at last September’s 3.1% level, when inflation is forecast to hit 7% by April, would result in widespread hardship, push 400,000 people into poverty, and ratchet up pressure on households hit by the cost of living crisis.  Couple families with children who are on low incomes, both in work and out of work, would experience a real terms cut of £500 a year, while pensioner couples would lose £540 a year, according to the JRF analysis. It comes four months after a £1,000 cut to the incomes of households on universal credit when the £20 a week top-up to help claimants deal with the extra costs of Covid was withdrawn, and will hit families just as soaring energy bills start to bite. JRF estimates that the net cost of uprating benefits by 7% would be £7.5bn. “At a time when the case for support could not be clearer, the government is choosing to further erode the value of benefits that are already wholly inadequate,” said Peter Matejic, deputy director of evidence and impact at JRF. He added that this was another cut for millions of people when the value of out-of-work benefits was at an all time low. “There can be no justification for this. Our social security system should protect people from harm, not put them in danger,” he said. Meanwhile, a Tory peer and former minister has urged the government to support struggling families in the form of cash top-ups paid via universal credit, which he called a “really efficient way of directing funds to the poorest”. Lord Freud said it was a mistake to cut the £20 a week top up to universal credit in October when it was “clearly needed”. Freud, who oversaw the introduction of universal credit while minister for welfare reform in the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) between 2010 and 2016, also savagely criticised government policies such as the two-child limit on benefits and the benefit cap introduced during his time in office. Freud told an audience at the Legatum thinktank on Wednesday, the two-child limit was “vicious” and an “excrescence” that – like the benefit cap – should be scrapped. He also criticised cuts to local housing allowance support for low income tenants in the private rented sector. Freud, who was promoting his memoir Clashing Agendas of his time at DWP, said those policies – and other cuts such as those to disability benefits – had been forced on a reluctant DWP by the Treasury as the price of introducing universal credit. The JRF said too many families were already going without essentials because of increases in the price of food and other basics. The removal of the energy price cap in April could increase low-income families’ gas and electricity bills by an average of £566 a year. It is calling on the government to upgrade benefits in line with the Bank of England’s February forecast of 7%. “At the very least this would stop this real terms cut to benefits and protect families on the lowest incomes from the worst impacts of rising costs.” The DWP was approached for comment.",News/Society,"Millions will be worse off with below-inflation universal credit rise, say experts",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/24/millions-worse-off-below-inflation-universal-credit-rise-say-experts
2/24/2022,"Formula One’s Russian Grand Prix remains on the calendar despite Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The race at the Sochi Autodrom is set to take place in September but neither F1 nor the sport’s governing body, the FIA, have acted to cancel the meeting which is backed by the Russian government. A statement from F1 on Thursday morning noted only that the sport was monitoring the situation. “Formula 1 is closely watching the very fluid developments like many others and at this time has no further comment on the race scheduled for September. We will continue to monitor the situation very closely,” it read.  The FIA has still yet to issue any comment on the race in Russia. Uefa is set to drop St Petersburg as the venue for this season’s Champions League final. F1’s teams and drivers are currently in Barcelona for the first test of the season. Seven of the teams are based in the UK and the British government’s position on holding sporting events in Russia is already clear. Boris Johnson has said there should be “no chance of holding football tournaments in a Russia that invades sovereign countries”, a position emphasised by a government spokesperson, who said: “We have serious concerns about the hosting of international sporting events in Russia, such as the Champions League final, and will discuss these with the relevant governing bodies. We will not allow president Putin to exploit sporting and cultural events on the world stage to legitimise his renewed illegal invasion of Ukraine.” In 2014, the year the first Russian GP was set to be held, there were calls for it to be cancelled after the Russian annexation of the Crimean peninsula. The former world rally champion and a candidate for the FIA presidency, Ari Vatanen, was outspoken in his condemnation of the event. “Do we support the regime who is masterminding this bloodshed? Or do we say this is not correct?” he said. “It would send a message of acceptance if we went to Russia. It would say we condone, effectively, maybe not explicitly, but by our actions we condone what is going on because it is used in propaganda.” Vatanen said he was supported in his opinion by then FIA president Jean Todt but F1’s chief executive at the time, Bernie Ecclestone, was adamant that sport and politics should not mix and that the race, which was backed financially by the Russian government and supported by Vladimir Putin, should go ahead.

2/24/2022,"Far sassier than your standard early 90s slow jam, blessed with a laconic Lisa “Left Eye” Lopes rap: let rumour-mongers and spreaders of “crap street yap” beware! Somethin’ You Wanna Know is the sound of a band already far more sophisticated than their cartoonish early image suggested.  A track that’s aged noticeably better than Poetic Justice, the Tupac/Janet Jackson movie it soundtracked, Get It Up brilliantly slows down the synth riff from the Time’s 1981 Prince-produced version, turning it into a sleazy electronic buzz. TLC, meanwhile, sound as if they’re having a hoot with its party-starting lyrics. Also from a movie soundtrack – this time Waiting to Exhale – This Is How It Works is TLC at their most lubricious: a demand for men to “take time out your fantasies” and consider instead what the lady might enjoy that ends with Left Eye giving detailed instructions on the matter. Distinct hint of G-funk about Babyface’s production. A perfect example of late 90s R&B pushing at sonic boundaries, with producer Dallas Austin possibly operating under the influence of Timbaland. The beat stammers, the backing track is made out of buzzes, metallic clanks and whoops, and the hook hammers itself into your brain while the lyrics preach total female independence. Patched together from unreleased Left Eye solo tracks after her death, 2002’s 3D was – by TLC’s standards – a relative flop. That doesn’t mean there’s not great stuff there: the frantic Dirty Dirty’s Timbaland-produced, Missy Elliot-featuring, Kool and the Gang-quoting mayhem being an utterly thrilling case in point. Switch demonstrates what a leap forward CrazySexyCool was from TLC’s debut. From its buoyant-but-subtle use of a guitar sample from Jean Knight’s Mr Big Stuff to the understated vocals, to the chunk of Rapper’s Delight Left Eye coolly swipes during her verse, it just sounds supremely confident: a band who know they’re hitting their stride. Videos saturated in neon and primary colours; the gimmick of attaching condoms to your sunglasses: you can see why people thought TLC initially dealt in “kiddie-cute hip-hop”. But that undersells how good their debut album frequently was: the single remix of Hat 2 Da Back is raw and writhingly funky. Produced by Organized Noize – and featuring a fantastic guest appearance from OutKast’s André 3000 – CrazySexyCool’s darkest moment broods both on the state of the world and personal issues: having pleaded guilty to arson, Left Eye was in rehab for most of the album sessions. Grinding distorted guitar deep in the mix underscores the mood. Girl Talk features the most arresting opening line in TLC’s catalogue – “You see, I had this brother who was mad at me / Cos I told my homegirl that he wasn’t packin’” – as well as the equally great diss “thinkin’ you got powers like Austin but you’re more like Mini-Me”. If the sound is indebted to Destiny’s Child, the insistent catchy chorus makes up for it. What About Your Friends is the early TLC at their most poppy: it’s just a great song, powered by an immense breakbeat (made by combining samples from James Brown and Sly & the Family Stone’s Sing a Simple Song). Its remix, meanwhile, introduced the world to TLC’s fellow Atlanta natives OutKast. “It’s kinda rock’n’roll,” offered T-Boz about Red Light Special, which perhaps tells you more about the preponderance of guitar solos on it – and the raunchiness of the accompanying video – than the song itself: an ultra-classy, beautifully written slow jam that very nearly topped the US chart. The killer track from the uneven post-Left Eye album 3D reunited T-Boz and Chilli with Austin, the producer they worked with on their debut album. An acoustic guitar driven ballad that prickles with distrust and paranoia, plus a hint of the Stylistics in its flickers of electric sitar, it should have been a huge hit. Kept off the top of the US charts by Boyz II Men’s End of the Road – ironically the handiwork of the same producers Babyface, LA Reid and Daryll Simmons – Baby-Baby-Baby is quintessential early 90s pop-R&B. If you’re in search of something tougher, the beat-heavy Left Eye-featuring Remix Rap version is for you. A perfect pop ballad and a perfect lazy summer anthem, Diggin’ on You hits a perfect sweet spot between smoothness – the melody is beautifully turned, T-Boz and Chilli’s vocals creamy – and something tougher, provided by the snapping rhythm track, punchily loud in the mix. Apparently inspired by Nirvana’s use of dynamics (T-Boz was a fan), I’m Good at Being Bad keeps wrongfooting the listener, slipping from a radio friendly MOR ballad to tough hip-hop and back again, throwing in snatches of Donna Summer’s Love to Love You Baby and what sounds like a melodic echo of TLC’s own Waterfalls along the way. Improbably, the influence of production team the Bomb Squad lurks around TLC’s debut single. The verses and intro are tricked out with bursts of atonal noise that could have stepped off a Public Enemy album, before the whole thing resolves into a sweet pop chorus: an arresting way to introduce yourself. Whether you take the lyrics as a sisterly broadside against deadbeat men or – less loveably – a latterday show-me-the-money equivalent of Gwen Guthrie’s Ain’t Nothin’ Goin’ on But the Rent, No Scrubs is a completely undeniable single: every melody feels like a hook, the whole thing works to perfection. Left Eye apparently didn’t want Creep released, feeling its lyrics about countering a boyfriend’s cheating with some of your own were too passive: “[Creeping] is ripping families apart / The leading cause of a broken heart,” she snaps on the remix, at odds with the song’s message. Luckily, she relented: a fabulous song, beautifully produced and sung, Creep is one of 90s R&B’s crowning glories. For a 23-year-old song, Unpretty feels weirdly current: its messages about beauty standards, self-image and mental health – inspired by T-Boz’s brush with sickle-cell anaemia – are far more common in pop today than they were in 1999. Moreover, it coats them in the loveliest tune that TLC ever recorded. To be honest, there is barely a cigarette paper between the top four songs on this list in terms of quality, but let’s plump for Waterfalls, not merely because it’s a brilliant song, or because Organized Noize’s production doesn’t feel like it’s dated at all in the decades since it was released, but because it was a genuinely bold single to release. Behind the nailed-on chorus lurk stark lyrics about murder and Aids that effectively make Waterfalls a protest song, including a bleak, personal rap by Left Eye about missed chances: “Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true.”",Arts/Culture,TLC’s 20 greatest songs - ranked!,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/24/tlcs-20-greatest-songs-ranked
2/24/2022,"In her book entitled Schadenfreude: The Joy of Another’s Misfortune, the author and academic Dr Tiffany Watt Smith argues that it is “part of how we cope with inferiority or our own failures”. She and others view it as a natural reaction. A study by the psychologist Mirella Manfredi from the University of Milano-Bicocca illustrated that your brain has decided you are going to laugh at, say, someone tripping over or even scoring three own goals in a football match whether you like it or not. The latter happened to the New Zealand Women’s centre-back Meikayla Moore in the first half of their game with the Unites States in the SheBelieves Cup this week. A perfect hat-trick. As it turns out only one of them – the third – approached anything close to Jamie Pollock levels of hilarity. The others were just a bit unlucky – but nevertheless it is quite the achievement.  “A hat-trick of own goals. This is tremendous.” I tweeted. It didn’t go viral, I was a little behind. I didn’t come up with anything clever – such as Adam Hurrey’s “Does the match ball get to put her on its mantelpiece?” Not everyone, however, found it funny. One correspondent quote-tweeted my post with the response: “Imagine suffering what is probably the worst day of your career and having people tweet about how tremendous it is for clicks. Expected better from you @maxrushden that player might well be in a dark place today. #BeKind #DoBetter” My instant reaction to this was scorn. No one likes being told they’re wrong or unkind. No one likes being patronised to hashtag do better. Elite sport is brutal. There is no place to hide. People choose to do it. And it’s only a game. But did he have a point? Clearly it wasn’t “tremendous” for the player. I hadn’t even considered her feelings in my haste to join to the latest viral moment – she looked distraught as she was substituted before half-time. And it’s quite hard to argue that any tweet is doing anything other than looking for clicks. The first thing to address is the obsession with social media – and quite possibly my low-level addiction. What is my actual aim in posting this, or anything? The dopamine of retweets, a desire to be part of a conversation, a need to be “relevant”? I find myself in the baking aisle in the supermarket unable to remember what my wife has asked me to get seconds before because my mind is taken up wondering whether I am a bad person and whether/how I should respond to someone who expects better from me. Second, is the reaction different because it’s a woman making a mistake (or three mistakes) on a football pitch? Had Harry Maguire done it – it’s always Harry Maguire in these hypothetical situations – would the response be the same? Lucy Bronze said after the last World Cup the increased scrutiny on the women’s game had come as a bit of a shock to the players. More eyeballs means more praise for England’s excellent showing in the Arnold Clark Cup, for the predatory instincts of Ellen White, and the unlikely goalscoring exploits of Millie Bright. But it surely also means we laugh when it’s funny. That said, I haven’t been watching the SheBelieves Cup at all. So do I have the right to laugh about one moment from it? The difficulty here is that alongside the reasonable and considered responses on Twitter coming to my defence came those tedious and depressingly expected ones: seeing this clip as conclusive “proof” that the women’s game isn’t any good and that “you can’t laugh at anything any more”, while yelling snowflake in permanent caps lock at my correspondent. I don’t want to be the mouthpiece for that crowd. I don’t want to be on the Joe Rogan side of this culture war. The question then remains whether it’s ever OK to laugh at own goals and gaffes. Maybe Danny Baker and Nick Hancock spent the 90s causing untold, unknown damage to Wayne Hatswell, Chris Brass and Peter Devine. Was You’ve Been Framed a hate crime? Should I stop watching that video of the gameshow contestant catapulting a watermelon into their own face from point-blank range? We should consider the role social media plays in catapulting anything – not just watermelons – around the world so quickly. Even if Moore hasn’t turned on her phone or logged into Twitter or Instagram in the past few days she’ll know that the football world has seen the footage. She is known for that, and not for her previous 49 caps or her club career in Germany and now Liverpool, or her advocacy for LGBQT+ inclusion in sport. On countless occasions, I’ve trotted out the cliche that footballers are human beings too – with emotions and feelings just like the rest of us – because, well, it’s true. And being human means footballers will act differently to this kind of thing – some will laugh it off, some won’t. You imagine that the mental fortitude to make it at this level helps. You hope Moore is surrounded by a supportive squad. I hope she gets promoted to the WSL with Liverpool and shines next season. As Thomas Tuchel said of Romelu Lukaku: “It’s not the time to laugh about him and make jokes about him. He’s in the spotlight of course but we will protect him.” Yet I laughed heartily at his seven touches against Crystal Palace. If he starts on Sunday in the Carabao Cup final, you’d imagine Liverpool fans will count every touch he makes quite loudly. I want to be kind, I want to do better, but I still want to laugh at own goals. Maybe it’s enough to just say my brain made me do it against my will. I resolve – again – to spend less time on Twitter.

2/24/2022,"Southern Water is offering discounts on bills to some people engaged in a non-payment protest campaign over raw sewage discharges, in an apparent concession to the boycott. The non-payment protest, which was backed by Sir Bob Geldof, began because of anger at the level of untreated sewage discharged into coastal waters.  It came after the water company was fined a record £90m for discharging billions of litres of raw sewage into the seas of Kent and Hampshire from 2010-15. An Environment Agency investigation is ongoing into more recently alleged illegal discharges. Those refusing to pay their bills include a local Conservative councillor, Ashley Clark. Earlier this month Clark was offered a 50% discount on his bill of £158.63. In a letter to the company, Clark has accepted the discount. He said: “This I accept on the basis … that it is proper to make a contribution in respect of the times that sewage in this area was treated in accordance with expectations. “It remains my contention that it is wholly inappropriate to contribute in respect of releases that prudent action and timely investment would have largely prevented.” Clark said despite Southern Water explaining the difficulties of surface water ingressing into treatment works, he believed the matters should have been addressed following privatisation a generation ago. He said that over a six-month period covered by his bill there were 49 days of sewage pollution alerts. Julie Wassmer, an author from Whitstable who is also a non-payer, said she had yet to be offered a discount but that a 100% concession had been offered to a resident in east Kent. She said: “Now that the company has given a 50% discount on the original demand to one boycotter, and offered concession to another resident in Kent, then clearly the company must offer the same concession to the remaining boycotters. “In the interest of fairness, Southern Water should offer a 100% discount to all 4.7 million wastewater customers the company serves across Sussex, Kent, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight.” Donna Howden, the head of customer services at Southern Water, said: “We cannot comment on the individual circumstances of any customer. We support customers who are going through tough times, including [through] payment holidays, special tariffs, debt write-offs, bill reductions and grants for household items. “Southern Water currently provides over 126,000 customers with some form of financial assistance, an increase of 21,000 since the start of the pandemic. Last year we provided over £12.5m worth of support. Ultimately, it is the bills customers pay which enable us not only to carry on providing water at the turn of a tap and taking wastewater away but to invest to protect the environment and boost local economies.”",News/Environment,Southern Water offers bill discounts to some sewage protesters,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/24/southern-water-offers-bill-discounts-non-payment-protest-boycott-sewage
2/24/2022,"Eddie Jones has handed the returning Courtney Lawes the England captaincy against Wales but left Ben Youngs – who is in line for his record-breaking 115th cap – on the bench with Harry Randall continuing at scrum-half. Lawes comes straight back into the side at blindside flanker, having been sidelined with a head injury since mid-January, and resumes the captaincy from Tom Curry. The 33-year-old was named captain last autumn against Tonga and South Africa with Owen Farrell unavailable and though he has not been able to play in either of England’s matches against Scotland or Italy so far this Six Nations, Jones has made a point of keeping him around the squad.  As reported by the Guardian, Manu Tuilagi is also back in the side following a hamstring injury but Jones’s decision to leave Youngs among the replacements on such a landmark occasion is a considerable surprise. Randall impressed against Italy last time out, making only his third start, and his fledgling partnership with Marcus Smith has evidently impressed Jones. His selection is a signal of intent from Jones given the tempo that Randall brings with Youngs having to surpass Jason Leonard’s caps record from the bench. Tuilagi, meanwhile, comes in at inside-centre with Henry Slade moving to No13 in a mouthwatering midfield combination with Max Malins and Jack Nowell – who lasted only 16 minutes against Italy before he was withdrawn with a head injury – on the wings. Tuilagi has not appeared in the Six Nations since England edged past Wales two years ago – a match in which he was sent off in the closing stages but his return is a welcome boost for Jones. Freddie Steward continues at fullback. In the pack, Alex Dombrandt keeps his place at No8 ahead of Sam Simmonds while Maro Itoje returns to the second-row where he joins Charlie Ewels. Ellis Genge and Luke Cowan-Dickie – who have both been named as four vice-captains – are alongside Kyle Sinckler, who makes his 50th appearance, in the front-row. Slade and Curry are the other two deputies while Joe Marler, Jamie George, Will Stuart, Nick Isiekwe, George Ford and Elliot Daly join Simmonds and Youngs on the bench.

2/24/2022,"A voluntary ban on the phasing out of lead shot in the UK has had almost no impact according to a report, with 99.5% of birds killed found to contain the toxic metal. While other industries have been forced to phase out lead, with the material banned from paint and fuel decades ago, shooters are still allowed to use it despite the fact it could poison soil and wildlife.  In 2020, the British Association of Shooting and Conservation announced that it, along with other shooting groups, wanted to phase the use of lead out by 2025, and urged its members to start switching. But scientists from the University of Cambridge found there had been no change since this ambition was stated. Their study last year showed that 99.4% of recovered pheasants contained lead shot. This year, the amount has marginally increased to 99.5%. The study, published in Conservation Evidence, states: “We found that 99.5% of the 215 pheasants from which shotgun pellets were recovered had been killed using lead ammunition. We conclude that the shooting and rural organisations’ joint statement and two years of their considerable efforts in education, awareness-raising and promotion, have not yet had a detectable effect on the ammunition types used by hunters who supply pheasants to the British game meat market.” The scientists obtained 336 whole birds or oven-ready prepared carcasses from 70 businesses of various types, and at least one shot and/or shot fragment was recovered from 215. Chemical analysis then found that of the 215 pellets analysed, lead was the principal element in 214 pellets. Wild Justice, a wildlife campaign group, said “Another 12 months of zero progress from the shooting industry. All talk and no action. UK governments should simply ban the use of lead ammunition rather than let this charade continue.” Research by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust showed that between 50,000 and 100,000 wildfowl die in the UK each year as a result of ingesting lead from used pellets. Despite being highly toxic, the pellets are often mistaken for food by wildfowl. A further 200,000 to 400,000 birds suffer welfare or health impacts, and animals that predate on wildfowl can also suffer. Some shooters complain steel is more difficult to use, as it is lighter, spreads less and has denser shot patterns, resulting in less margin for error in gun handling and trigger timing. Others are concerned that older guns cannot safely be used with steel shot, meaning they will have to buy a new one. The government is currently considering plans to ban lead, and Waitrose announced in 2019 that it would not be stocking game meat shot with lead pellets. Adrian Blackmore, director of shooting at the Countryside Alliance said: “The Countryside Alliance remains firmly committed to a voluntary transition away from lead shot and single-use plastics for all live quarry shooting using shotguns by 2025. We are only two years into that five-year transition period; a period during which we have had to live with the Covid pandemic. Cartridge manufacturers are also committed to this. However the industry has been under immense pressure due to disrupted global logistics supply chains and commodity shortages caused by the ongoing Covid-19 restrictions.”",News/UK news,Voluntary UK ban on killing birds with lead shot has had ‘no detectable effect’ ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/24/voluntary-uk-ban-on-killing-birds-with-lead-shot-has-had-no-detectable-effect
2/24/2022,"Jason Robinson has led a series of emotional tributes to dual-code rugby legend Va’aiga Tuigamala after his death at the age of 52. Tuigamala, known globally as “Inga the Winger”, played for the All Blacks at the 1991 Rugby Union World Cup before switching to represent his native Samoa in the 1995 Rugby League and 1999 union World Cups.  In total, he won 19 caps for the All Blacks in rugby union and 23 for Samoa and two caps for Samoa in rugby league. Having arrived in the United Kingdom from New Zealand in 1993, Tuigamala played 102 games for Wigan Warriors during five seasons at the club, scoring 62 tries. He won three league titles with Wigan and two Challenge Cups before returning to union, where he made 126 appearances for Wasps and Newcastle Falcons, scoring 180 points. Robinson, who played with Tuigamala at Wigan in the 1990s, wrote on social media: “Absolutely heartbroken! I owe so much to this amazing man! Literally helped change my life when he came to ⁦@WiganWarriorsRL⁩ from NZ.” Wigan Warriors will hold a minute’s silence before their Super League match against Huddersfield at the DW Stadium on Thursday evening The club’s executive director, Kris Radlinski, said: “Every now and then a player comes along who touches the heart and soul of every single fan, player, coach and administrator – Inga was one of them. He was one of the most exciting rugby players to play either code. His presence on the rugby field was huge. As a teenager, he gave me the most precious thing that anyone could, time. We would spend hours on the field doing one on one’s together. It is a very sad day for the club. Rest in peace my friend.”",Sport/Sport,"Va’aiga Tuigamala, dual-code rugby legend, dies aged 52",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/24/vaaiga-tuigamala-dual-code-rugby-legend-dies-aged-52
2/24/2022,"Choreographer Ben Duke and his company Lost Dog are on a winning streak. After unconventional takes on Paradise Lost and Romeo and Juliet, they bring us a Dickens-inspired story that’s complex but to the point, funny and full of feeling. As in those previous works, Duke considers a classic text – and the human emotions within it – by fabricating a whole new vantage point. For A Tale of Two Cities, we arrive long after the action of the final page. Our guide is little Lucie Manette (Nina-Morgane Madelaine), who escaped from Paris in the throes of the French Revolution with her mother, also Lucie, and father Charles Darnay, and has plenty of questions about why. Now grown up, Lucie is making a documentary about her family, unpeeling secrets her parents have been withholding for years. While uncovering the story in retrospect, themes bubble to the surface: about our responsibility for the actions of our forebears and whether we can escape our pasts.  In a chatty intro, as tightly packed as Dickens’ dense text, Lucie suggests we draw a family tree on our programmes to keep track of the characters. A basic overview of the plot in advance is probably useful, but you are soon absorbed into her investigation by the script’s dry asides, light marital bickering and out-loud laughs. Lucie’s video camera is not a prop but instrumental in the scene-making. As she interviews her parents, the live feed is projected on to the roof of a semi-ruined house on the stage – the dance between the bodies in front of us and the screen allows for sudden changes of focus or slips into memory. Duke has mastered a way of working that seamlessly crosses forms. This is finessed theatre, without being actorly; Duke uses dance (and music) only when necessary, to vivify the storytelling or a mental state – when Madame Defarge (Temitope Ajose-Cutting) discovers her sister has been raped, she buckles at the core then the softness escapes her body until it’s an empty machine. It’s rare to see all these elements used so skilfully, non-gratuitously, with pacing that pulls in the viewer, even if you already know the facts before Lucie does. It’s a work that deserves to be widely seen, not only by dance audiences or Dickens fans. At the Place, London, until 5 March, then touring.",Arts/Stage,Lost Dog: A Tale of Two Cities review – the best of times,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/24/lost-dog-a-tale-of-two-cities-review-ben-duke-dickens
