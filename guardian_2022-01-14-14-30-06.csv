1/14/2022,"These first few days of the new year have been blustery, and the wind has scoured most of the snow off of the hilltops. During a lull from wind and rain, I take a chance and head out to a remoter path of the Abernethy forest. The track is strewn with small, wind-torn branches and twigs, lichen and pine needles. Clouds scud across the sky and the forest is an ever-changing mosaic of light and shade. A stiffening breeze drowns out any birdsong that may be about, including the flock of finches that fly over what I know will be crossbills. From somewhere among the trees, I hear an odd sound of metal against metal, a hollow jangling that doubles and trebles, each tone a slightly different key. From within the trees I see a cow, then another, and more still – one is black, another grey, a few are sandy brown, and one’s a darker brown with a white face and rings around its eyes. They turn to look at me with a mixture of vague curiosity and nonchalance, before turning back to continue munching on the heather.  This herd, a mixture of breeds, has been introduced to this forest to mimic the work that aurochs – the now extinct native wild cattle that used to roam here – would previously have done. They’ll eat the heather and churn up the ground with their hooves, creating more opportunities for biodiversity in the field layer and giving space for new flushes of blaeberries and crowberries that are such important food sources for capercaillies – these so elusive and threatened birds that I always hope to see. There’s something quite magical about their stillness and the size of them. Usually, any larger animals in this place will be deer, which will startle and spring away, but these cows are going quietly about their business; if it wasn’t for their cowbells, I may not even have noticed them. I turn back to take another path, watching them from afar as they lumber off, their jangling receding as they disappear further into the woods, lost among the Scots pines once more.

1/14/2022,"The Philippine government has defended a controversial ban that prevents unvaccinated people from using public transport in the capital of Manila, denying that the policy is “anti-poor”. The “no vaccination, no ride” policy is designed to curb a recent wave of Covid infections and applies to all modes of transport to and from Metro Manila, including public buses, jeepneys, rail, boats and planes. The policy will be fully implemented from Monday, according to local media, when passengers will be required to show proof of vaccination.  Less than half of Filipinos are fully vaccinated, though vaccination rates are higher in the capital, at more than 90% of the eligible population. Rights groups, including the Philippine Commission on Human Rights and Amnesty International, have criticised the transport ban for unvaccinated people, warning that it penalises the poorest, who are less likely to have the option of working from home or of travelling in a private vehicle. “The reality is that ordinary Filipinos continue to rely on public transportation in attaining basic needs, such as for food, work and accessing health services,” the Philippine Commission on Human Rights said in a statement. It fears that even those who should be exempt from the rules could still struggle to access essential goods or services because they do not have a private vehicle. The Philippine Commission on Human Rights said the government should find less punitive ways to promote vaccination. “We continue to urge the government to address vaccine hesitancy and the low vaccination rate in the country with education that addresses common misconceptions and positive encouragement,” it said. The Department of Transportation, however, said the policy was not “anti-poor, draconian or punitive”, adding: “We believe that it is more anti-poor and anti-life if we do not impose interventions that will prevent loss of life due to non-vaccinations.” It said exemptions would be made for people who were unable to receive a vaccination for medical reasons, as well as those who needed to buy essential goods or travel to a vaccination site. The Philippines has experienced a recent surge in infections, which health experts have blamed on the more transmissible Omicron variant. The country reported a record 34,021 cases on Thursday, the highest since the start of the pandemic, half of which were reported in the national capital region. A further 82 deaths were confirmed. The rise in cases has placed a strain on public services, including hospitals and schools, as well as private businesses. Schools in the capital have announced they will close for a week, with no online or in-person classes, while the government has placed limits on the amount of paracetamol and other over-the-counter medicines that can be bought by one individual or household, due to shortages in shops. Last week, unvaccinated people in Manila and several other provinces and cities were told to stay home, with president Rodrigo Duterte ordering the arrest of those who violate the orders. Under the rules, unvaccinated residents may leave home only for essential reasons such as work or to buy essentials or access medical care. Businesses such as restaurants and beauty salons are also operating at a lower capacity, as are churches and parks.",News/World news,Philippines accused of being ‘anti-poor’ with public transport ban on Covid unvaccinated,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/14/philippines-accused-of-being-anti-poor-with-public-transport-ban-on-covid-unvaccinated
1/14/2022,"Hillsong church will not be fined by police over a New South Wales youth camp where congregants were filmed singing and dancing, despite the state’s health minister saying the event was “clearly in breach of both the spirit and intent” of public health orders. The church apologised on Friday for “giving any perception that we were not playing our part to keep New South Wales safe” after footage of its annual youth summer camp near Newcastle provoked widespread outrage amid the state’s Covid case numbers.  NSW police said officers had attended the event in the Newcastle area and spoken with organisers but would not issue a fine. “Following discussions with organisers and after consultation with NSW Health, no infringement will be issued,” acting assistant commissioner Peter Glynn said in a statement on Friday. The church confirmed it had been instructed by NSW Health to “cease congregant and student singing and dancing” at the camp, and had immediately done so. However, the church continued to deny that the camp, which runs until Sunday, had any similarity to music festivals, which are explicitly banned both indoors and outdoors until 27 January under an amendment to the NSW public health order. Religious services are exempt, but footage of maskless congregants dancing to pop music at the camp has angered many at a time when festivals and concerts are being cancelled.  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “It is important to clarify that the current youth camps we are holding are not music festivals,” Hillsong said, claiming the camp was “low risk as described under current guidelines”, because it was held outdoors, with sports activities and no alcohol, and the roughly 200 students attending were all “part of the same social network”. “These camps have a Christian focus and include worship services. Over a three-day duration, the percentage of time spent singing is minor. However, we regret giving any perception that we were not playing our part to keep NSW safe and we sincerely apologise to the community at large,” the statement said. The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, said earlier the event was “clearly in breach of both the spirit and intent” of the public health order. The premier, Dominic Perrottet, said he was “incredibly disappointed” by the scenes and said the church should be fined if it was found to have breached the order. The independent Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie said it was “a music festival, no doubt”. “No doubt it will also top off with a super-spreader [event],” Lambie told Channel Nine’s Today show on Friday morning. “Newcastle had a super-spreader [event in December] go around from a nightclub. What is the difference? Because they don’t have a drink in their hand? Are you kidding me?” Perrottet said the state government would tighten regulations if Hillsong escaped a fine due to a “loophole”. “But I don’t want to do that because that means that it will capture a whole lot of other organisations that are doing the right thing … I’ll take the advice in relation to the legal teams at NSW Health and if they are in breach, which is what the information I’ve received from the health minister is, then a fine should be issued,” he said. Musicians have been particularly outspoken about the footage, with several big names forming a protest supergroup called Thrillsong. After the Hillsong footage was widely shared, artists including the Jungle Giants, What So Not, Art vs Science, CC:DISCO!, Illy, Lime Cordiale, Montaigne and Peking Duk came together to protest against the ban on live music while religious services and sporting events are allowed to continue. “We firmly support measures to protect our fans and communities and to safeguard our healthcare workers. We simply ask that if rules are made, they apply to everyone equally,” they said in a joint statement. “We need to be in this together.” Electronic artist Chris Emerson, who performs as What So Not, said he was actively seeking out religious and sporting venues for Thrillsong to perform in, to highlight the double standards. “We are very seriously looking with legal teams into whether we have a cause for discrimination against the NSW government,” he said. “We’ve also got a lot of time on our hands, and a lot of spirit, so we’ll willingly get together and perform some sort of religious ceremony as Thrillsong if that is the only way we can play. “I’d love everyone to be singing and dancing, it is just so frustrating when people not in the music industry are given permission to run these events when people in the industry are complying with really expensive regulations and doing everything right. Music festivals have been targeted, while a church gets to put on a music festival.” Sam Hales, guitarist of the Jungle Giants, said they just wanted one rule for all live events. “No one wants to cancel cricket or the Australian Open or religious events. We just want to be at the table; we want to be considered alongside sport and the church,” he said. “It’s really hard to see tens of thousands of people at a sporting event, all yelling, no social distancing. A band can play to them, but three doors down at a venue, the same band would have their gig cancelled. That’s the new discourse – music doesn’t happen any more, sports and religion does. “We need to start spotlighting all these double standards. It doesn’t make any sense and it is getting silly.”",News/World news,Hillsong escapes fine after denying youth camp with dancing and singing was ‘a festival’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/14/hillsong-denies-youth-camp-dancing-and-singing-was-a-festival-as-police-investigate
1/14/2022,"Covid hospitalisations are expected to peak next week, according to NSW Health, and an analysis of health data shows the growth in the number of hospital patients with Covid is slowing down. In a press conference on Friday morning, the deputy secretary of NSW Health, Susan Pearce, said: “What we are starting to become increasingly confident of is that we will see a plateauing next week, and that is pleasing, but that plateauing is obviously still at a relatively high level of Covid patients in our hospitals and in our ICUs.”  NSW Health also released an update to its previously released modelling, which shows how hospitalisation figures have been tracking against different possible scenarios. Currently, the actual numbers are below the best-case scenario included in the modelling document: Pearce emphasised that despite the encouraging numbers, hospitals would still be under significant pressure for the near future. “Behind every line and every dot on that page are people,” she said. Analysis of the growth rate in the number of people hospitalised supports the suggestion that while numbers continue to rise, a peak is approaching. Dr Edward Jegasothy, a biostatistician at the University of Sydney’s School of Public Health, shared an analysis of the change in hospitalisation numbers on Twitter, which we have reproduced here. It’s important to note that the chart shows the rate of change, and that whenever the line is above zero numbers are increasing: Jegasothy said the graph indicated a “deceleration” of growth in Covid cases in hospital, while adding the caveat that there were a lot of unknowns with the spread of the virus, testing and other aspects which add a degree of uncertainty. “It seems that over the past 10 days, we’ve seen a fairly consistent decline in the metric of percentage change,” he said. “If we were seeing an exponential growth in cases, the growth rate should increase. But since that growth rate is decreasing, it suggests that we’re approaching a plateau.” All of the above analysis focuses on hospitalisation numbers, rather than case numbers, which have had significant issues with testing delays, changing criteria, and people’s inability to find a rapid antigen test all contributing. Prof Adrian Esterman, writing in the Conversation on when the Covid wave might be over, said “it is unclear whether changes to testing rules have been factored into the modelling”. “However, it’s understood, even if the detection rate changes significantly, it doesn’t affect any projection of when the peak will be reached that much,” Esterman wrote. “Modelling is therefore still likely to be reasonably accurate despite the changes to Covid testing. This is good news for other states and territories that rely on modelling results for planning.”",News/News,NSW expects Covid hospitalisations to peak next week.

1/14/2022,"It was a moment thought nearly impossible after a decade of impunity: a senior Syrian intelligence officer jailed for life for helping direct the horrors of one of modern history’s most brutal wars. But as Anwar Raslan, a former colonel in Bashar al-Assad’s forces, bowed to his fate, survivors of the barbarous regime of torture that he helped run finally had something to cling to.  The clinical calm of a German courtroom could not have been more at odds with Raslan’s former realm, the terrifying dungeons of Syria, which harboured industrial-scale death and suffering throughout a conflict still feared for its unrestrained savagery. But as the verdict was read, victims and family members sensed a rare moment of justice – a concept so elusive in Syria, it had almost become redundant. The ruling marks the first time a senior member of Assad’s security state has been convicted for wartime atrocities and follows a litany of failed efforts to do so by family members of tens of thousands of disappeared and an international community unable, or unwilling, to take on more prominent targets. For victims and their families, the symbolism was potent, as was the precedent. Though Assad and his inner sanctum remain far from the reach of international justice, the verdict complicates the Syrian leader’s creep towards normalisation with a world that had largely ostracised him. Assad and his henchmen have so far deflected a multitude of crimes: using poison gas on their people, imposing starvation sieges and the forced displacement of millions, among other allegations of war crimes. Throughout it all, Syria’s infamous prisons became central to systemised suffering and even extermination. But Raslan’s conviction, as well as that a year ago of a man considered to be a security functionary, Eyad al-Gharib, paves the way for greater accountability. It also adds to a weight of evidence being painstakingly built by international bodies, and non-government organisations, which refuse to let the brutality of Syria recede without redress. Long a pariah, regional states Jordan and the UAE have made recent moves to bring Assad back into the fold. This week came a fresh suggestion that Syria should be readmitted into the Arab world – a thought that heavyweights Saudi Arabia and Egypt are known not to oppose. Raslan was tried under the legal principle of universal jurisdiction, which allows the prosecution of crimes in one country even if they happened elsewhere. That the trial took place in Germany was no coincidence; Raslan had sought asylum there after fleeing Syria through Jordan. Germany, unlike many other western states, has shown rare enthusiasm in putting on trial alleged perpetrators of international crimes against humanity on its soil, including cases against members of the Islamic State who committed genocide against Yazidis , as well as cases in the aftermath of massacres in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda. But standing between the ambitions of prosecutors and family members who would like to reach Assad’s inner sanctum are the cold realities of global politics. Syria is not a party to the international criminal court, and its allies, Moscow and Tehran, have given Assad blanket cover before the UN security council, preventing him being referred to The Hague. With Syria in ruins and both Russia and Iran looking to capitalise on the enormous sums they invested in safeguarding Assad, neither appear likely to cut him loose, or to expose senior officials to global justice, for now. A fundamental shift in either Vladimir Putin, or Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s position would be necessary to force Assad from power, and even then his fate would more likely be a life in exile under protection, rather than a European court. However, among the hundreds of thousands of refugees that fled to Europe as the Syrian state collapsed and Islamic State overran parts of the country, are other protagonists and keepers of the regime’s darkest secrets. A Syrian doctor and regime official will soon also go on trial in Germany. Other officials continue to be interrogated. This chink in Assad’s armour of impunity may not be the last.",News/World news,Syrian survivors cling to hope Raslan case will mark end of regime’s impunity,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/14/syrian-survivors-cling-to-hope-raslan-case-will-mark-end-of-regimes-impunity
