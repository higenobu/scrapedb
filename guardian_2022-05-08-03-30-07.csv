5/8/2022,"If the west could find the courage, it would order an immediate freeze of Rupert Murdoch’s assets. His Fox News presenters and Russia’s propagandists are so intermeshed that separating the two is as impossible as unbaking a cake. On Russian state news, as on Fox, bawling ideologues scream threats then whine about their victimhood as they incite anger and self-pity in equal measures. Its arguments range from the appropriation of anti-fascism by Greater Russian imperialists – the 40 countries supporting Ukraine were “today’s collective Hitler”, viewers were told last week – to the apocalyptic delirium of the boss of RT (Russia Today) Margarita Simonyan. Nuclear war is my “horror”, she shuddered, “but we will go to heaven, while they will simply croak”. Russia would never give genuine western journalists airtime. But it can always find a slot for its favourite quisling: Fox News’s Tucker Carlson. He pushes out Russian propaganda lines or perhaps creates his own lies for Russia to use. Ukraine, not Russia, is the real tyranny. Nato provoked poor Vladimir Putin. The west is plotting to use biological weapons. Last week, he floated the theory that the war was not the result of an unprovoked invasion by a colonialist dictatorship but of the Biden administration’s desire to avenge Donald Trump’s victory in 2016. It was a big hit in Moscow, reported BuzzFeed’s Julia Davis. “State TV propagandists loved it so much, Russia’s 60 Minutes included it not once, but twice in their evening broadcast – neatly bookended by the Kremlin’s war propaganda.” Putin’s appeal to both the far right and the Chomskyan wing of the far left in Europe and North America is worthy of a study in itself. He was a dream for ultra-reactionaries: a white, Christian strongman, who was anti-liberal and anti-EU. His victories heralded a world in which might was right and morality was for losers. In Europe, Russia’s atrocities have forced everyone from Arron Banks and Nigel Farage to Marine Le Pen and Matteo Salvini to find urgent reasons to change the subject. In the US, there remains a market for Putinism among a large minority of Republican voters. Their yearning for dictatorship, as evidenced by the support given to denying legitimate election results and to the fascistic forces that stormed Congress, is greater. The hatred of liberals in power is deeper. Murdoch is boosting Russian morale and, conversely, undermining Ukrainian resolve by supplying a dictatorship with foreign validation. Do not underestimate its importance. Russians who suspect their TV anchors are state-sponsored bootlickers are more likely to believe foreign commentators who assure them that the lies they are hearing are true. Reporters risk their lives but Putin cannot fire or imprison Fox News presenters, steal their wealth or poison them with Novichok. Russian forces will not reduce their towns to rubble, rape them, torture them, burn them alive in theatres or shoot them in the head by the side of forest roads. Murdoch and his employees have nothing to fear from Putin. Their endorsement of Kremlin war propaganda carries conviction because it is freely given. As useful to Russia is the wider chilling effect. I have seen journalists start off making eloquent and plausible critiques of the left’s hatred of free speech, for instance, or its tolerance of regressive religion, only to find that careers in the worst of the rightwing media come with a price tag. To succeed on Fox News in the US, they don’t have to agree with banning abortion or denying climate change but they must never make their objections public. The UK’s sanctions regulations include among the reasons for freezing an oligarch’s assets “obtaining a benefit from or supporting the Government of Russia”. The Biden White House promises to punish those “responsible for providing the support necessary to underpin Putin’s war on Ukraine”. On both interpretations, there is a plausible prosecution case for freezing the assets of Murdoch’s NewsCorp. Because it is a media conglomerate, sanctions would be an attack on free speech. I say this plainly because so many writers and political actors pretend that they are not demanding censorship when that is precisely what they are doing. Nevertheless, in this case the threat to freedom is minimal. Murdoch would not be punished for revealing embarrassing truths about the west but for spreading demonstrable lies for a hostile foreign power. If you still feel queasy, imagine if Murdoch’s media organisation were exactly as it is today and producing the same arguments the Kremlin uses to justify its crimes. The one difference is that Murdoch is Russian rather than Australian. I don’t believe there would be the slightest hesitation in removing him and his family from control of their businesses. Indeed, the UK, EU and US have already announced sanctions against Russian broadcasters and individual journalists. I have not heard anyone claim that they are attacking press freedom, rather than trying to cripple the propaganda capacity of a warmongering state. The Murdoch empire contains the Times and Wall Street Journal, whose Russian coverage has been admirable, and HarperCollins, which with a bravery few other publishers would match, fought off a vicious legal assault by the Russian oligarchy and their pet London lawyers against a critical study of Putin’s power. But good deeds count for nothing in assessing the desirability of sanctions. The tycoon Oleg Tinkov spoke for many rich Russians when he denounced the “massacre” in Ukraine and called for an end to the “crazy war”. The oligarchs the west has sanctioned are losing their fortunes and what little influence they had. Of course they hate Putin’s strategy. Western governments don’t care because, as Tom Keatinge of the Royal United Services Institute explains it to me, they know that a large portion of oligarchical wealth is at Putin’s disposal. Their private thoughts and, when they dare risk assassination attempts, public protests are irrelevant. The need to end war in Europe comes first. Tender-hearted readers may object that Murdoch is now 90 and may well not be in full control of his organisation. But surely this is an argument for removing him? If in his dotage he is allowing himself to become a cross between Lord Haw Haw and Tokyo Rose, it would be a kindness for western governments to save him from himself.

5/8/2022,"Brdo smells of spring. The air drifting down from the Slovenian Alps feels fresh and clean, the stillness interrupted only by birdsong and distant church bells. Dmytro Riznyk looks across at three immaculate pitches; directly behind him a small stand has been ingeniously embedded in a bright, grassy mound. Football environments rarely get more idyllic but, for those working here this week, the beauty is drowned out by a constant, silent scream. “I’ll only find peace again when I return to my country and there is no war there,” says Riznyk, one of four goalkeepers in the initial phase of Ukraine’s first training camp since it was invaded. “We are here and my heart is there. We believe in the people who are defending it and believe we will win. When that happens, the fear will go away.” Still, Riznyk was ready when the time came to travel. He spent the first four days of the war at a maternity ward in Poltava, where he plays for Vorskla, with his wife and newborn son. It was the heaviest of wrenches to leave them, but on 30 April he joined the national team’s staff on a 20-hour bus journey from Kyiv to their bucolic new base. Most of his 22 colleagues are from Dynamo Kyiv and Shakhtar Donetsk; they have been playing charity matches abroad and could fly to Slovenia but Riznyk is a rarity. Other clubs more or less suspended operations so he has spent almost two months training alone, between trips to the bomb shelter and the haunting wail of sirens, in preparation for a crack at the World Cup. “We hope to honour our country, and also that we can bring joy to our people,” he says. If Ukraine beat Scotland in next month’s playoff semi-final they will face Wales; win both and a place in Qatar will be secured. In a tournament contested under a shadow, their presence would represent a beam of light. “I’m not putting pressure on them, it’s very difficult,” says the head coach, Oleksandr Petrakov. “I never expected to work under such conditions.” Petrakov is 64 and thought he had seen everything. In contrast to Riznyk he says a feeling of calm enveloped him as the bus crossed Ukraine’s border with Hungary: there were no snaking, futile queues at petrol stations for dwindling supplies of fuel and he sensed “the kind of life I’d maybe forgotten”. Imbuing his players with some measure of serenity while conditioning them physically for two intense qualifiers from what is essentially a standing start will, he admits, be the toughest challenge of his career. “I try to joke, to tell them some interesting stories from football and life, to raise their spirits,” he says. Petrakov speaks with dry humour but an hour spent watching Ukraine train – in a gentle session shortly after their Dynamo contingent has arrived – confirms a tactility, a lightness, in his interactions. “It’s important to distract them from bad thoughts but on the other hand we all know people are dying for Ukraine. They have to keep it in their minds and hearts, as the whole country is waiting for some happiness. We have to put it together for them.” Petrakov worries his players have not been able to go “full gas”, as he puts it, in their friendlies and knows time to attain a competitive tempo is short. Their foreign-based players, including Oleksandr Zinchenko and Andriy Yarmolenko, should be closer to speed and will arrive later in May; Ukraine play a friendly against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Wednesday but require a couple of more exacting tests before walking out at Hampden Park. The timing is difficult but they hope to face at least one African national team before the month ends. Any benefits of football might appear nebulous at best while the horror on the ground remains so real. So it is striking to hear the veteran midfielder Taras Stepanenko, talking in a pastel-white room overlooking the training complex, explaining the squad receive messages from soldiers on the frontline every day. “They make only one demand: ‘Please do everything you can to go to the World Cup,’” he says. “For the country, for them, it’s a moment of hope and it will be like a celebration. That’s why we have to play not only like a football game; we have to play with our souls, our hearts.” Perhaps this, in fact, is sport at its purest: Russia has hardly concealed its intention to erase Ukrainian culture and a football team is one obvious representation of a country’s heart, its craft, its creativity. Playing football on the highest stage is a show of defiance on one level but, on another, an act of preservation and perpetuation. That thought rears up again during a conversation with Serhiy Sydorchuk, the Dynamo midfielder who, at 31 and with 47 caps, is another senior figure in a youthful group. He sits on a terrace outside the team’s hotel, yards from a reconstruction of a traditional local house on wooden stilts. Sydorchuk played in his club’s charity games and there is a different image he cannot get out of his head. Before Dynamo played Legia Warsaw in the Polish capital last month, they visited a factory that had been repurposed to accommodate Ukrainian refugees. The players gave toys and sweets to children who had fled with their mothers or grandparents: one was a seven-year-old boy who had been drawing and, pulling up the photo gallery on his phone, Sydorchuk shows the image that was presented. The scene is heartbreaking: the boy’s drawing, chillingly bright and vivid, depicted a burning set of houses with a Russian flag flying above them. “It’s tough to see, very tough,” Sydorchuk says. “I hope in future he will live his life normally and have everything he wants. But I think a broken or scarred heart will remain.” Qualifying for the World Cup might at least inspire happier means of self-expression. Given the freedom to travel, Ukraine’s footballers are in favourable situation – “When you see people who lost everything, and you have something, it’s a very shocking moment,” Sydorchuk says – but the Dynamo and Shakhtar players have still known the practical consequences of Russia’s violence. In the invasion’s early days he and his family, including his then pregnant wife, spent two days and nights under blankets in the car park beneath their home. His international teammates Serhiy Kryvtsov, Andriy Pyatov and Mykola Matvienko joined them. The nearby airport at Zhuliany had been bombed and the reverberations made their apartment’s window handles fall off. Others have suffered more severely but, as he scrolls through his archive again to show his children sleeping in an open car boot, the point is reinforced that everyone here carries their own trauma with them. “This isn’t only a training camp,” he says. “Everything is different now. It’s very heavy feeling.” There is raw anger, too, beneath the professionalism and the methodical way Ukraine’s travelling party describe their experiences. Petrakov expresses it strongest of all: perhaps he feels the most able to. He wants to see Russia punished more severely in a sporting sense, beyond their expulsion from the World Cup and the season-long ban from Europe for their club sides. “They should be banned five years, minimum,” he says. “They have to pay for their support of Putin. They’re killing our women, our children, destroying our cities, so they have no right to compete in sport. If we don’t stop their aggression, they will come for other parts of Europe. It’s not a peaceful nation so, in sport, they should pay for it.” Riznyk speaks about the help his Vorskla teammates, who are now back in group training, have been giving to hospitals and refugees as volunteers; Sydorchuk describes how his parents and in-laws in Zaporizhzhia, the first relatively safe destination for those who have managed to escape Mariupol, have been giving new arrivals food. The energy and love expended to keep all facets of a country alive defy comprehension. “We’re all united in this,” Sydorchuk says. “If you’re a journalist, do your journalism work. If you’re a football player, play football for your country. If you’re a normal worker, you can work. Because we have a professional army, we have military volunteers who can fight. But everybody is together, and that’s a very important thing.” The message is, in the worst of circumstances, simply to be the best you can. For the Ukrainians in Slovenia, whose training is conducted in front of hoardings advertising Lvivske beer and other products from home, that means carrying the torch all the way to Doha. “We need to win our games, but I’m thinking about it,” admits Ryznik, even if he faces a battle to make the final cut. As night falls and the midges outside offer a reminder that the time of year brings its minor inconveniences, Petrakov wonders whether the mission he never sought has become his destiny. “I’m at such an age where I don’t want anything: no house, no car,” he says. “But if I take the team to Qatar, I have lived my life for a reason.”",Sport/Football,"‘If we get to Qatar, I’ve lived my life for a reason’: inside Ukraine’s training camp",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/07/if-we-get-to-qatar-ive-lived-my-life-for-a-reason-inside-ukraines-training-camp
