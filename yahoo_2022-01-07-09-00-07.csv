1/7/2022,"William Bennett was fired months after a video showed him on top of a student and pulling his hair. Bennett admitted to ""saying something about being shot"" to the student, who is a gunshot victim.  Now the student's mother is suing the teacher for physical and emotional stress and humiliation.  A Kentucky teacher who was seen in a viral video pinning a student to the ground and pulling his hair was terminated from his position, according to documents obtained by Insider.  William Bennett, a former science teacher at Marion C. Moore School in Louisville, was fired last month after a Jefferson County Public Schools investigation found that Bennett ""escalated the situation"" and made ""inappropriate comments"" about the student, per a termination letter.  The letter stated that the incident, which occurred in August 2021, unfolded as such: the student, 16-year-old Jamir Strane, appeared to have initiated the fracas by punching Bennett in the back of the head, then Bennett ""caught the student"" and put his ""whole body weight on top of him.""  In videos of the incident that have been posted to social media, students witnessing the altercation can be heard yelling, ""get the fuck off him"" to Bennett and trying to help Strane get out from under him.   Though another adult emerged to deescalate the situation, resulting in Strane walking away from Bennett, the letter states that Bennett ""proceeded to engage in the altercation."" Bennett reportedly followed Strane down the hallway, had a verbal exchange with the student, and kicked him.  According to the letter, Bennett admitted to saying something to Strane ""about being shot,"" which ""provoked"" the student and set off the initial verbal incident.  An unnamed student quoted in the report stated that he overheard Bennett tell Strane he was ""just another Black boy that got shot.""  Neither Strane nor Bennett responded to Insider's requests for comment. However, Strane previously told outlets that he had been shot in a drive-by shooting in 2020 and that he punched Bennett after the teacher said he was ""going to end up in the streets dead.""  According to a report from Child Protective Services, Bennett's comments were ""triggering"" for Strane, ""who suffers ongoing emotional trauma as a previous gunshot victim.""  Bennett told district investigators that he did not believe his comments were disparaging as Strane had previously bragged about the shooting, per the report. The report also states that Bennett referenced the Kentucky state statue on self-defense and force — which allows a person to use physical force to defend themselves if they believe it is necessary to protect against the use of imminent force by another person — and showed investigators pictures of his non-white family members to ""dispel any myths of being a racist portrayed in the media.""  Traci Hunt, the principal of Marion C. Moore School, told district investigators that Bennett previously refused to complete the school's mandatory implicit bias training and was involved with a previous incident with a school counselor, leading her to have concerns about his performance as a teacher before the altercation.  The district investigation also revealed that Bennett, who can appeal his recent termination, had at least one other physical run-in with a student at a previous job.  The student's mother, Erica Strane, filed a lawsuit against Bennett and Jefferson County Public Schools, on Wednesday, according to her lawyer, Aubrey Williams.  The lawsuit alleges that Bennett reportedly slammed and pummeled Jamir, restraining him while ""yelling obscenities, profanity and racial slurs at him.""  There are discrepancies between the lawsuit's categorization of the incident and the findings of the district investigation. Videos of the incident do not appear to show Bennett punching Jamir or yelling racial slurs at him.  Nonetheless, the lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, argues that Jamir suffered ​​""physical, mental, emotional stress, strain, and humiliation"" as a result of the incident.  A representative said the district does not comment on pending litigation.

1/7/2022,"Psaki dismissed DeSantis' criticisms of the Biden administration's COVID-19 testing plans. DeSantis said testing should be prioritized for vulnerable populations. DeSantis hasn't been ""exactly advocating for people in his state to get vaccinated,"" Psaki said. White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Thursday swiped at Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis over his criticisms of the Biden administration's COVID-19 testing plans. ""It's pretty rich coming from Governor DeSantis, given he is somebody who's been ... not exactly advocating for people in his state to get vaccinated, which we know is the way that people can be protected, way that lives can be saved,"" Psaki told reporters during a press briefing on Thursday. ""If he wants to be a constructive part of this process then perhaps he should encourage what scientists say is the best way to save lives, prevent and reduce, and that is getting vaccinated and getting boosted,"" she continued. DeSantis has opposed several of President Joe Biden's COVID-19 responses, including vaccine requirements. The latest tussle between DeSantis and the Biden administration over the handling of the coronavirus pandemic involves testing. As the highly contagious Omicron variant spreads across the country, Biden last month announced efforts to meet the rise in demand for COVID-19 tests. Among the new strategies include setting up additional federal testing sites in several states and buying 500 million at-home testing kits to mail to Americans who request them. DeSantis this week dismissed the federal government's plan, claiming it's unwise to send tests to everyone and that vulnerable communities should be prioritized. ""The point of matter is not every single person needs to be going out always getting tested. You have healthy people. That's not a good strategy,"" DeSantis told Fox News on Thursday. ""But what is a good strategy is to have these at-home tests available for our vulnerable population."" DeSantis announced on Thursday that his administration plans to send 1 million at-home tests to vulnerable communities, including nursing homes, long-term care facilities and senior citizens. DeSantis this week also released new testing guidelines for Floridians, advising young and healthy people and people who are not showing COVID-19 symptoms to forgo testing so that more tests may be available for vulnerable populations. The guidance was met with criticism from public health officials and experts who say that testing is crucial to getting the pandemic under control. Individuals without symptoms can contract COVID-19 and spread the virus to others unknowingly, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Roughly 64% of people in Florida are fully vaccinated, according to data compiled by the New York Times.

1/7/2022,"Hospitals across the U.S. are feeling the wrath of the omicron variant and getting thrown into disarray that is different from earlier COVID-19 surges. This time, they are dealing with serious staff shortages because so many health care workers are getting sick with the fast-spreading variant. People are showing up at emergency rooms in large numbers in hopes of getting tested for COVID-19, putting more strain on the system. And a surprising share of patients — two-thirds in some places — are testing positive while in the hospital for other reasons. At the same time, hospitals say the patients aren’t as sick as those who came in during the last surge. Intensive care units aren’t as full, and ventilators aren’t needed as much as they were before. The pressures are neverthless prompting hospitals to scale back non-emergency surgeries and close wards, while National Guard troops have been sent in in several states to help at medical centers and testing sites. Nearly two years into the pandemic, frustration and exhaustion are running high among health care workers. “This is getting very tiring, and I’m being very polite in saying that,” said Dr. Robert Glasgow of University of Utah Health, which has hundreds of workers out sick or in isolation. About 85,000 Americans are in the hospital with COVID-19, just short of the delta-surge peak of about 94,000 in early September, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The all-time high during the pandemic was about 125,000 in January of last year. But the hospitalization numbers do not tell the whole story. Some cases in the official count involve COVID-19 infections that weren't what put the patients in the hospital in the first place. Dr. Fritz François, chief of hospital operations at NYU Langone Health in New York City, said about 65% of patients admitted to that system with COVID-19 recently were primarily hospitalized for something else and were incidentally found to have the virus. At two large Seattle hospitals over the past two weeks, three-quarters of the 64 patients testing positive for the coronavirus were admitted with a primary diagnosis other than COVID-19. Joanne Spetz, associate director of research at the Healthforce Center at the University of California, San Francisco, said the rising number of cases like that is both good and bad. The lack of symptoms shows vaccines, boosters and natural immunity from prior infections are working, she said. The bad news is that the numbers mean the coronavirus is spreading rapidly, and some percentage of those people will wind up needing hospitalization. This week, 36% of California hospitals reported critical staffing shortages. And 40% are expecting such shortages. Some hospitals are reporting as much as one quarter of their staff out for virus-related reasons, said Kiyomi Burchill, the California Hospital Association’s vice president for policy and leader on pandemic matters. In response, hospitals are turning to temporary staffing agencies or transferring patients out. University of Utah Health plans to keep more than 50 beds open because it doesn't have enough nurses. It is also rescheduling surgeries that aren’t urgent. In Florida, a hospital temporarily closed its maternity ward because of staff shortages. In Alabama, where most of the population is unvaccinated, UAB Health in Birmingham put out an urgent request for people to go elsewhere for COVID-19 tests or minor symptoms and stay home for all but true emergencies. Treatment rooms were so crowded that some patients had to be evaluated in hallways and closets. As of Monday, New York state had just over 10,000 people in the hospital with COVID-19, including 5,500 in New York City. That’s the most in either the city or state since the disastrous spring of 2020. New York City hospital officials, though, reported that things haven’t become dire. Generally, the patients aren’t as sick as they were back then. Of the patients hospitalized in New York City, around 600 were in ICU beds. “We’re not even halfway to what we were in April 2020,” said Dr. David Battinelli, the physician-in-chief for Northwell Health, New York state’s largest hospital system. Similarly, in Washington state, the number of COVID-19-infected people on ventilators increased over the past two weeks, but the share of patients needing such equipment dropped. In South Carolina, which is seeing unprecedented numbers of new cases and a sharp rise in hospitalizations, Gov. Henry McMaster took note of the seemingly less-serious variant and said: “There’s no need to panic. Be calm. Be happy."" Amid the omicron-triggered surge in demand for COVID-19 testing across the U.S., New York City's Fire Department is asking people not to call for ambulance just because they are having trouble finding a test. In Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine announced new or expanded testing sites in nine cities to steer test-seekers away from ERs. About 300 National Guard members are being sent to help out at those centers. In Connecticut, many ER patients are in beds in hallways, and nurses are often working double shifts because of staffing shortages, said Sherri Dayton, a nurse at the Backus Plainfield Emergency Care Center. Many emergency rooms have hours-long waiting times, she said. “We are drowning. We are exhausted,” Dayton said.  Doctors and nurses are complaining about burnout and a sense their neighbors are no longer treating the pandemic as a crisis, despite day after day of record COVID-19 cases. “In the past, we didn’t have the vaccine, so it was us all hands together, all the support. But that support has kind of dwindled from the community, and people seem to be moving on without us,” said Rachel Chamberlin, a nurse at New Hampshire's Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. Edward Merrens, chief clinical officer at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health, said more than 85% of the hospitalized COVID-19 patients were unvaccinated. Several patients in the hospital's COVID-19 ICU unit were on ventilators, a breathing tube down their throats. In one room, staff members made preparations for what they feared would be the final family visit for a dying patient. One of the unvaccinated was Fred Rutherford, a 55-year-old from Claremont, New Hampshire. His son carried him out of the house when he became sick and took him to the hospital, where he needed a breathing tube for a while and feared he might die.  If he returns home, he said, he promises to get vaccinated and tell others to do so too. “I probably thought I was immortal, that I was tough,” Rutherford said, speaking from his hospital bed behind a window, his voice weak and shaky. But he added: ""I will do anything I can to be the voice of people that don’t understand you’ve got to get vaccinated. You’ve got to get it done to protect each other."" ___ Casey reported from Boston and Thompson from Sacramento.
