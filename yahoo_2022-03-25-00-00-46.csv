3/25/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- An Indian couple became the country’s first husband and wife to build their respective startups into enterprises with at least $1 billion valuation, also known as unicorns.

Less than a year earlier, her husband Asish Mohapatra’s OfBusiness reached the same valuation after backing from SoftBank Group Corp. and others. Kalra, 38, and Mohapatra, 41, are alums of Indian Institute of Technology and met while working at McKinsey & Co. Both startups are profitable, an unusual feat for young growth companies. Kalra is the chief executive officer of Oxyzo while Mohapatra is the CEO at OfBusiness. Matrix Partners and Creation Investments also invested in Oxyzo in what is one of the largest Series A rounds in India’s startup industry. Oxyzo, a blend of the words oxygen and ozone, was founded by Kalra, Mohapatra and three others in 2017 as an offshoot of the couple’s first startup, OfBusiness, which they started along with three others in early 2016. Oxyzo uses technology to crunch data and provide purchase financing to businesses, giving out cash-flow based loans in a credit-starved country where small and medium businesses struggle to get working capital. OfBusiness, formally known as OFB Tech Pvt., supplies bulk raw materials such as steel, diesel, food grains and industrial chemicals to small and medium-sized businesses. Its valuation surpassed $1 billion when SoftBank and others invested in April last year, according to Mohapatra. In December, the startup’s valuation reached nearly $5 billion as SoftBank and others put more money into it, he said via phone. Kalra, who was a partner at McKinsey, left the firm to join entrepreneurial forces with her husband, who exited venture-capital company Matrix. “We both had an itch to go out and build something,” she said. The two startups run separately with different offices and teams, Kalra said. However, they target the same industries such as manufacturing and infrastructure sub-contracting. Both are based in Gurgaon, in the suburbs of New Delhi. Oxyzo has more than 500 employees and a data warehouse specializing in supply chain analytics. It has disbursed over $2 billion in loans and has been profitable since its inception. In the statement, investor Norwest described Kalra as the country’s “first female founder in India of a profitable, fintech unicorn.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Hong Kong’s Completely Avoidable Covid Catastrophe Silicon Valley’s Wealthiest Russian Is Carefully—Very Carefully—Distancing Himself From Putin China Bets on $1.5 Trillion of Tax Cuts in Quest for Growth The Future of Boosters Is Somewhere Between Unnecessary and Urgent A Once Radical Idea to Close the Wealth Gap Is Actually Happening ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•yesterday,Husband and Wife Entrepreneurs Mint Own Unicorns Within a Year,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/husband-wife-entrepreneurs-mint-own-065307307.html

Nvidia currently uses Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co to build its products. “We’re very open-minded to considering Intel,” Huang said Wednesday in an online company event. “Foundry discussions take a long time. It’s not just about desire. We’re not buying milk here.” Intel jumped to a session high on the news. CEO Pat Gelsinger announced last year that the chipmaker, once the world’s technical leader, would seek to construct new factories and manufacture products for others, even rivals. Huang said Intel’s effort to compete with the two Asian companies as a foundry operator will require more than building plants, it will have to fundamentally change its culture and operations. “Being a foundry at the caliber of TSMC is not for the faint-hearted,” he added. “TSMC dances with the operations of 300 companies worldwide.” Intel will need to learn to attune itself to the way that customers want to work, which hasn’t been part of the company’s experience as it makes chips of its own design, Huang said. Nonetheless, moving into the business of being an outsource manufacturer is something that Intel has to do, he said. Intel shares rose as much as 2.5% to $49.58 in New York trading.

3/25/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s oil refiners are discreetly purchasing cheap Russian crude as the nation’s supply continues to seep into the market. Most Read from Bloomberg Putin Adviser Chubais Quits Over Ukraine War, Leaves Russia China Plane Crash Update: Searchers Identify Parts of Wreckage Russia Central Banker Wanted Out Over Ukraine, Putin Said No Wall Street Is Scrambling For the Exits in Moscow — and Billions Are at Stake China Jet’s Dive Took It Near Speed of Sound Before Crash Unlike India’s state-run oil refiners, which have issued a number of tenders seeking to buy Russia’s flagship Urals crude among other grades, traders say China’s state processors are negotiating privately under the radar with sellers. The nation’s independent refiners are also quietly buying, according to traders who asked not to be identified as the information is confidential. Most buyers are shunning Russian crude after its invasion of Ukraine, fearing damage to their reputation or falling foul of sanctions. China’s independent refiners, which account for a quarter of the nation’s processing capacity and are mainly based in Shandong province, bought some ESPO oil that’s loaded at Russia’s eastern port of Kozmino, according to traders. The recent ESPO purchases by independent refiners, known as teapots, are for May-loading cargoes, and the Chinese processors are continuously making inquiries about Russian oil, traders said. ESPO is a favored grade because it can be shipped to their smaller ports -- that are unable to unload larger vessels -- from a shorter distance, cutting down costs. Some teapots are working with traders on financing options and checking on the availability of vessels to ship the crude at a reasonable price, and are also considering buying Urals, said traders. The cargoes of Urals purchased by state-run processors are for June delivery, they added. Trading of Russian oil has mostly shifted away from the public eye after its invasion of Ukraine. Willing buyers and sellers are being forced to engage in private negotiations after some tenders attracted zero bids. Shell Plc got heavy criticism after its purchase of Urals not long after the war started. Another of Russia’s Far East crude grades -- Sokol -- is also flowing to India. State-run Indian Oil Corp. and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. bought some Sokol loading in May from ONGC Videsh Ltd., an equity partner in the Sakhalin-I project, according to traders. Cargoes are loaded from the De-Kastri terminal. Indian Oil, Hindustan Petroleum and ONGC declined to comment. Japan’s Sakhalin Oil and Gas Development Co. known as SODECO, which also has an equity interest in Sakhalin-I, declined to comment on its future exports of Sokol crude. Traders said some buyers in North Asia are likely to take their already-committed cargoes of the grade in May. India has so far bought at least 13 million barrels of Urals since late February, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, with Indian Oil purchasing a further 3 million barrels in its latest tender. Volumes to the nation averaged about 128,000 tons a month in 2021, Bloomberg calculations based on ship-tracking data show. Urals is shipped from ports in the Baltic and Black Seas.

While only 33 stocks resumed trading, Russians with fortunes linked to them added $8.3 billion combined, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index tracking the wealthiest 500 people in the world. Scores of Russian billionaires got sanctioned by the European Union and the U.K. after the Kremlin started its war against Ukraine. Some got their possessions in those jurisdictions seized, and others rushed to shift ownership of their stakes while they still could. But for the 10 tycoons whose shares resumed trading, the advances were adding to their paper gains. Vladimir Potanin, Leonid Mikhelson and Gennady Timchenko each grew their fortunes by more than $1 billion on Thursday. Timchenko got sanctioned by the European Union and the U.K. -- and by the U.S. following Crimea’s annexation in 2014 -- though Potanin and Mikhelson didn’t. The gains on Thursday partly offset a 33% plunge on Feb. 24, the day Russia invaded Ukraine. Before the trading halt, the 23 tycoons part of the world’s 500 richest people had more than $316 billion of combined wealth, down $58 billion for the year. The 33 stocks that resumed trading on the Moscow exchange had some restrictions that helped prop up the market: foreigners were not allowed to offload their holdings and short selling was banned.

3/25/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- The Biden administration and European Union are close to a deal aimed at slashing Europe’s dependence on Russian energy sources, as the U.S. and its allies seek to further isolate and punish Moscow for the Ukraine war. Most Read from Bloomberg Putin Adviser Chubais Quits Over Ukraine War, Leaves Russia China Plane Crash Update: Search Expanded; Calls to Flight Crew Where Mornings Would Get Darker Under Permanent Daylight Savings Time China Jet’s Nosedive From 29,000 Feet Baffles Crash Specialists China Jet’s Dive Took It Near Speed of Sound Before Crash President Joe Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said that an agreement would be announced as soon as Friday. It’s intended to ensure supplies of American natural gas and hydrogen for Europe, according to an official familiar with the plans. “A major priority for both the president and his European allies is to reduce the dependence of Europe on Russian gas, full stop, and the practical road map for how to do that -- what steps have to be taken, what the United States can contribute, what Europe has to do itself,” Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One on Wednesday. “This has been the subject of intense back-and-forth over the course of the past few days and weeks,” Sullivan said, “and we will have more to say on this subject, specifically on Friday.” He suggested the focus would be on diversifying European supplies of natural gas. “You can expect that the U.S. will look for ways to increase LNG supplies, surge LNG supplies to Europe, not just over the course of years, but over the course of months as well,” he said, using an acronym for liquefied natural gas. Biden is traveling to Brussels for meetings on the Ukraine war with NATO, Group of Seven and European Union leaders including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. He’ll travel to Poland on Friday to show U.S. support for NATO allies closest to Russia. Von der Leyen said in a tweet that the goal is commitments for additional supplies for the next two winters. It’s unlikely the U.S. will guarantee specific amounts of gas supplies to the EU, the official familiar with the plan said, and it’s unclear how the arrangement would work or whether it would include an agreement on pricing. The official asked not to be identified because the agreement isn’t final. Currently, European buyers compete with Asian countries for the world’s limited supply of liquefied natural gas cargoes. Ahead of Biden’s trip, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Sullivan and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese met this week with Exxon Mobil Corp. Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods, senior officials from energy companies such as Marathon Petroleum Corp., and leaders of other major corporations including JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. Dimon recommended the White House develop what he called a “Marshall Plan” to increase U.S. natural gas production and reduce development time for renewable energy production such as wind farms, according to people familiar with the discussion. The group also discussed how prepared U.S. oil and gas producers were to ramp up production, one person said. A second person said the officials and executives discussed the possibility of making up for production shortfalls if the EU ultimately decides to join the U.S. in banning imports of Russian crude. The people asked not to be identified because the meeting was private. Russia is the EU’s biggest natural gas supplier, accounting for more than 40% of imports. The EU, which also relies on the country for the biggest share of its coal and oil import needs, is struggling to shift its energy policy away from Russia. The European Commission on Wednesday adopted a draft regulation that requires countries to ensure that gas storage is filled to 80% before next winter and 90% in following years. The commission, the bloc’s executive arm, also called for joint purchases of gas by member states to help secure the best conditions.

3/25/2022,"The cliché says, 'May you live in interesting times.' We certainly are, as far as the stock markets are concerned. The strong bull market of 2021 turned into a full-on correction as 2022 got underway, but an upturn this month has moderated the year-to-date losses. The main takeaway for investors is volatility; it remains to be seen if the March gains are here to stay, or just transitory. No matter which way the market goes, investors can always find a clear path forward in the stock reviews from the Street’s best analysts. These are the top stock pros, with long-term reputations for successful calls on equities. The top analysts can boast success rates better than 70%, and an average return, based on the performance of the stocks they review, of 25% or higher. (See the Top Wall Street Analysts chart) So let’s get started following some top analysts, choosing them based on their great track records. The TipRanks database tracks over 7,900 of Wall Street’s analysts. We’ll look at three stocks which have been recently recommended by analysts rated at the very apex of the field. Ambarella (AMBA) First up is Ambarella, one of the semiconductor chip industry’s fabless firms. This simply means that Ambarella designs its chips, promotes and markets them, and may produce limited numbers of prototypes, but outsources the large-scale manufacturing of the silicon chips to larger chip foundries. Ambarella chiefly designs and distributes chips for video applications, specialized for high-res video compression and advanced image processing. The company’s chips are found in applications ranging from solid-state pocket vidcams to action cameras to dashboard cams to wearable cameras to drones, and are even found in broadcast television. Ambarella’s shares saw a sharp drop at the end of February, coinciding with the Feb 28 release of the company’s fiscal 4Q22 financial results. A look into the numbers will show us both strength and weakness, and may shed some light on the shares’ performance. To start with, Ambarella reported $90.2 million at the top line, and 45 cents per share at the bottom. These were significantly higher than year-ago values of $62.1 million and 14 cents, the EPS beat the forecast by over 7%. However, the revenue guidance of $88.5 million to $91.5 million for fiscal 1Q23 was a little light compared to consensus expectation of $90.9 million. Management’s stated belief that margins will contract slightly going into fiscal 2023 did not help, either. Top analyst Quinn Bolton, rated #2 overall in the TipRanks database, is not worried, and paints an upbeat picture of Ambarella's prospects in the long term. ""In the current environment for semiconductor equities, where investors appear increasingly concerned that the semiconductor industry may be getting late into the current upcycle, we believe investors are quick to sell companies that see any increases in channel or customer inventory levels. While we understand these concerns for semiconductor stocks that may have exposure to the broader semiconductor cycle, we believe these concerns are unfounded for companies such as Ambarella that are secular growth stories,"" Bolton opined. Looking closer at the company’s prospects, Bolton writes: ""Demand remains robust, CV adoption is expanding across the IoT camera and automotive segments driving blended ASPs higher and the automotive pipeline is building, with a significant opportunity for L2+ vehicles.” To this end, Bolton rates AMBA shares a Buy, and his $175 price target suggests the stock has ~82% upside ahead of it. (To watch Bolton’s track record, click here) Overall, this stock has picked up 15 analyst reviews recently, and they break down to 13 Buys, 1 Hold, and 1 Sell, for a Strong Buy consensus view. The average price target of $177.07 implies a one-year upside of ~84% form the current share value of $96.01. (See AMBA stock forecast on TipRanks) DZS (DZSI) Let’s stay in the tech sector, and take a look at DZS. This company lives in the network hardware niche, where it is a major supplier of broadband connectivity and communications software in the global markets. DZS provides a wide range of products and services, including optical line terminals, P2P switches, residential and business gateways, wi-fi access points, and mobile and optical edge solutions. DZS also provides customer support centers, professional services, and consulting services. Broadband is big business, generally, and has gotten a boost from the corona crisis and its push toward increased remote and online activity. DZS has seen that boost stay in place in the past year. For 4Q21, the most recent reported, the company showed $98 million in revenue, at the top end of the previous published $80 million to $100 million guidance. The company’s adjusted EPS, however, came in 5 cents, missing the 9-cent forecast by 45%. Looking forward, however, there is reason to believe that a broadband access firm like DZS can make gains in the near- to mid-term. In her recent comments in Louisiana, Vice President Harris reminded us that the Administration is pledged to spend $65 billion on buildouts of broadband access in rural and other underserved areas; this represents an clear opportunity for a broadband hardware provider. Stifel analyst Tore Svanberg, ranked #20 overall, acknowledges the expansionary environment for broadband when he writes, “The company's differentiated high-speed broadband and X-Haul wireless solutions are well positioned to capitalize on increased spending in support of more pervasive broadband build-outs in both North America and Europe as well as continued rollout/densification of 5G network deployments."" ""We expect these opportunities, along with increased geographic revenue diversification and competitively differentiated software services, to provide upside to margins over time and believe our estimates could prove conservative given our expectation for market share gains over the next few years,"" the top analyst added. Svanberg’s comments back up his Buy rating, while his $20 price target implies the stock has a 50% upside in the next 12 months. (To watch Svanberg’s track record, click here) Like Svanberg, other analysts also take a bullish approach. DZSI's Strong Buy consensus rating breaks down into 3 Buys and zero Holds or Sells. Given the $21.67 average price target, shares could climb ~63% in the coming twelve months. (See DZS stock forecast on TipRanks) Ceva, Inc. (CEVA) Last up is another semiconductor company, Ceva. Ceva focuses on DSP, or digital signal technology, and its products form an essential link in wireless tech; DSP has vital uses in the consumer, industrial, IoT, and mobile wireless niches. Ceva’s products have found uses in a wide range of applications, from 5G mobile infrastructure to AI networks to virtual reality headsets. In short, Ceva fits into the connection, no matter how it is made. Ceva posted strong financial results for 4Q21. In the report, released last month, the company noted that the top line hit a quarterly record, for the third consecutive quarter – Q4 revenues came in at $34, which was also a company record for a single quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS, at 22 cents, was up 10% from the year ago quarter. For the year as a whole, the top line rose from $100.3 million in 2020 to $122.7 million in 2021, a gain of 22%. Even though the financial results were strong, CEVA stock has failed to gain much traction lately. Shares are down 27% in the past 12 months. Some analysts, however, see this an opportunity for investors to get in at a discount. Kevin Cassidy, of Rosenblatt Securities, is one. He writes of Ceva, “We see the company having transformed from a licensor of IP cores to a licensor of IP platforms including full turn key integrated circuit development. This change increases leverage both in license and royalty revenue. CEVA's design expertise has growing importance as IoT products need to be connected locally or through the cellular network. Further, the recent share price pull back has offered an interesting entry point.” Cassidy, who holds the #32 spot in the TipRanks database, sets a Buy on CEVA, along with a $60 price target that indicates potential for ~54% upside this year. (To watch Cassidy’s track record, click here) There are only three recent share reviews for Ceva, but they are in agreement: this is stock is a Buy. The average price target is $58, suggesting ~49% upside from the share price of $39.01.
