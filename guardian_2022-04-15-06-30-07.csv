4/15/2022,"In the aftermath of the Brooklyn subway shooting, social media has found its latest star. Zack Tahhan, 21, was quickly anointed as a hero on Wednesday following the arrest of Frank R James, the suspect in the attack that injured 29. But the real story, it seems, was more complicated – and Tahhan wasn’t the day’s only hero. But he has certainly made the biggest splash. In videos that quickly spread on Twitter, Tahhan explains that he spotted James on security cameras. “I thought, ‘Oh shit, this guy, let me call the police,’” he says in one clip. He was soon telling his story to a gaggle of reporters in Manhattan’s East Village before heading off in a police car, waving as onlookers cheered. Thank you for your bravery today, Zack.All of New York is grateful. https://t.co/YPcU1EQO7p Since then, media reports have established Tahhan as a security camera technician from Syria who arrived in the US five years ago and speaks five languages. “We got him, thank God,” he told USA Today. “Oh, I do my best.” Videos featuring Tahhan’s upbeat tale received tens of thousands of likes and retweets, and he has inspired a hashtag, #ThankYouZack, and a GoFundMe. “This is what a hero looks like,” tweeted one poster. “Give this guy a TV show please,” added another. “I’m loving that people who were prevented from entering this country a few years ago are recognized for their heroism,” wrote another admirer of Tahhan, who said he was in the midst of fasting for Ramadan. Not only did he help catch the New York subway shooter, he's provided me with my new fave Ramadan meme. #ThankYouZack pic.twitter.com/dycWcT2Z4w Others reminded authorities to give Tahhan a $50,000 reward police promised for assistance in James’ capture. And the New York state attorney general, Letitia James, thanked Tahhan for his bravery: “All of New York is grateful.” Since Wednesday, however, reports have staged a more complex scene – and introduced a few more stars to the cast. A New York police spokesperson told the Guardian any tips were confidential. But police sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told the Associated Press that James called the police himself. He said they could find him at a McDonald’s in the East Village, the sources said. But when they got there, he wasn’t there, the chief of department, Kenneth Corey, told the agency. He was seen on a nearby street corner and police arrested him. However, several local people say they chipped into the effort. Tahhan credited his cousin Mo Cheikh with helping, telling PIX11 that the two of them had spotted James. Lee Vasu, a painter and gallery owner, told Artnet he had recognized James while walking with his family in the area. “I told my wife, ‘The subway shooter is right behind us. Go fast. Push the baby. No time for argument. Go,’” he said. After making sure they were safe, he said, he ran back toward James and notified a police officer – though others had also noticed him by that point. “I was looking at him as if I was drawing him,” Vasu told the site. “As an artist, you study every facial feature really well. I looked at him for quite a while and then half an hour later, there he was. You can’t escape an artist in the East Village.” Meanwhile, Francisco Puebla, manager of a nearby hardware store, was also on the case, he told the New York Times. Puebla had hired Tahhan to work on his store’s security cameras. “He’s all over social media,” Puebla said, “but I’m the one who took action.” Still, speaking to USA Today, he portrayed it as a team effort. After spotting James, he said, he asked the two people working on the security system – apparently including Tahhan – “to confirm with me if it was the same guy”. They agreed, “and then we looked at each other and we said, ‘Let’s call the police,’ but I said ‘You call,’ and they said, ‘No, you call.’” They didn’t want to get the wrong person into trouble, he said. Finally he approached a police car that had stopped nearby with the information. Ultimately, as the writer Rachel Handler, who lives locally and shops at the store, put it in Curbed: “the whole thing was a moment of beautiful New York City teamwork.”",News/US news,Zack Tahhan is being hailed for his NYPD tipoff.

4/15/2022,"As Mark Noble prepared to enter the pitch with 14 minutes left he could have been forgiven if his mind had drifted back to all the times when West Ham have been written off as a laughing stock. Noble has experienced his fair share of lows since making his debut 19 years ago and it is unlikely that he ever thought his final season as a professional would end up with him two games away from reaching a European final. But this is West Ham now. This is why their fans think they are massive. David Moyes has lifted them to unthinkable heights and he is far from done. Moyes will not settle for taking West Ham to their first European semi-final since 1976 after this astonishing triumph over Lyon. He will know his side are capable of more when they face Eintracht Frankfurt. West Ham are tough and Lyon could not handle their power. It did not matter that West Ham were without three key defenders. There was a towering performance from Craig Dawson, who scored the opener, and a huge showing from Declan Rice in midfield. West Ham knew they would have to be resilient after drawing the first leg 1-1 last week. There was no place for anyone in claret and blue to hide. Lyon would not allow it. They took their cue from a boisterous home crowd and it was clear that Peter Bosz had sent them out to be aggressive from the start. It was not long before Lyon, who were boosted by Tanguy Ndombele and Houssem Aouar passing late fitness checks, were creating chances. They had pace down the flanks and West Ham were fortunate not to be behind after five minutes. It was too easy for Lyon to play their way through on the left and, when Vladimír Coufal backed off, Karl Toko Ekambi had time to slide a low shot beyond Alphonse Areola, who was relieved to see the ball hit the woodwork. West Ham were living on the edge. They were rushed in possession and their defence was not inspiring confidence, particularly when they failed to deal with a cross from the right and Lyon appealed for a penalty when Coufal appeared to handle. It was too frantic from West Ham. It already seemed their defensive injuries were going to count against them. They were without Kurt Zouma and Angelo Ogbonna, depriving Moyes of his favoured centre-back pairing, while Aaron Cresswell was unavailable at left-back following his controversial red card last week. Yet Moyes had faith in Dawson and Issa Diop’s partnership in the middle. Diop has been shaky this season and looked nervy when he picked up a booking for tripping Dembele, but the Frenchman soon warmed to his task and the chances for Lyon started to dry up. West Ham began to enjoy themselves. Michail Antonio took the fight to Lyon. The striker was a handful throughout the first half and he almost created the opening goal when he crossed for Jarrod Bowen, who volleyed wide at the far post. Lyon were wobbling under the high ball. It was an obvious path to goal for West Ham, who were prepared. After 38 minutes Pablo Fornals swung in a corner and Dawson simply wanted it more than Lyon’s defenders. Nobody tracked his run and the centre-back put West Ham ahead on aggregate by powering his header in at the near post. Lyon looked stunned. There was no response and they cracked again before half-time. Ben Johnson, filling in for Cresswell, crossed from the left and Emerson Palmieri’s poor clearance was collected by Rice on the edge of the area. He took a touch and sent a low shot past Julian Pollersbeck, who was deputising for the injured Anthony Lopes in goal. Rice ran the length to celebrate with West Ham’s disbelieving travelling support and the home fans fell silent. This was not in the script and Bosz responded at the break by replacing Ndombele and Romain Faivre with Tetê and Lucas Paquetá, who was in the squad despite reportedly testing positive for Covid yesterday morning. By now, though, West Ham were in their element. Three minutes into the second half they stopped a Lyon attack and countered when Rice, Fornals and Manuel Lanzini calmly played their way out of trouble. The ball found the tireless Antonio, who held off Jason Denayer and laid the ball off for Fornals to send Bowen racing through with a superb ball. Lyon had completely lost their shape and Bowen coolly punished them, slipping a low finish beyond Pollersbeck. The tie was over. West Ham were too professional to let go of their lead. Frankfurt are next after stunning Barcelona and West Ham will believe they can go all the way. It was a shame that the night was overshadowed when Lyon’s ultras clashed with security staff after the final whistle.",Sport/Football,West Ham seal Europa League semi-final spot as goal flurry tames Lyon,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/14/lyon-west-ham-europa-league-quarter-final-second-leg-match-report
4/15/2022,"Almost exactly 27 years to the day since the former chief executive of the Rugby Football League, Maurice Lindsay, unveiled the grand plans for the advent of Super League and the proposed continental expansion which came with it, few should have afforded themselves a smile more than Lindsay here as history was made, with two French sides facing one another in the competition for the first time. The original plans for the first Super League season in 1996 included two French teams, Toulouse and Paris. That ultimately never materialised, with Toulouse not making it to the start line and Paris Saint-Germain lasting barely a couple of seasons. But here, the vision and belief so many traditionalists laughed at for years, the notion that two French teams could stand side by side in the elite competition, finally came to fruition as Catalans hosted Toulouse: and it was a moment for all of rugby league, not just those in France, to savour. “This is brother versus brother,” the Catalans Dragons chief executive, Alex Chan, admits. “We have to work together and not discredit each other as clubs. If we don’t look after Toulouse and they don’t work with us, we won’t grow in France. The vision was laid out all those years ago. They called the competition Super League Europe and now, it truly is a European competition.” The result here was almost secondary to the occasion, with the Dragons edging a hard-fought contest 18-10. These are fascinating times for rugby league across the Channel. Toulouse’s promotion to Super League for the first time comes not only in a World Cup year, but just three years out from the next hosting of the tournament, which will take place in France in 2025. “There’s a super relationship between both clubs,” Catalans’ head coach Steve McNamara says. “We’re aware of the importance of us both being in the elite competition and what that can bring across France and for other French clubs with a World Cup on the horizon here. There’s huge mutual respect for one another.” That respect disappeared on occasions on Thursday evening in a tempestuous and ill-tempered game, perhaps the least you would have expected from two French sides who play with passion in abundance. Catalans appeared in control in the early stages of the second half when they forged an 18-6 lead, but the red card of Joe Chan gave Toulouse a glimmer of hope. They, however, could not complete the comeback. Catalans’ success in recent seasons, winning the Challenge Cup in 2018 and making last season’s Grand Final, has boosted interest in the sport in Perpignan. But this felt altogether more significant in terms of the plans to grow the game across France, though you feel Toulouse’s continued involvement in Super League beyond this year will play a huge role in that long-term goal for rugby league to spread out of the north of England even more. “If we want the game to grow, we have to stay up,” Toulouse’s Tony Gigot says. “We can be stronger for each other and we need two good teams, and more French players to break through and play. That can only help French rugby league.” Alex Chan agrees: “The grassroots game in France needs an injection of positivity like this, to show there’s a reason we want youngsters to come and play. We want to put this product out to the world and show them that France is at the heart of rugby league.” Those close to the Catalans say that local interest in the buildup to this match eclipsed any ordinary Super League game against English opposition. The locals certainly enjoyed what was a momentous occasion but despite this being billed as a central part of the “Rivals Round”, these clubs have a much stronger bond than mere rivals. Together, they could potentially determine whether, 27 years after Lindsay’s initial vision, Super League can finally escape the constraints of its roots.",Sport/Sport,‘Brother versus brother’: Super League revels in first all-French derby,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/14/super-league-revels-in-first-all-french-derby-catalans-toulouse
4/15/2022,"Boxing’s embarrassing determination to avoid the unpalatable truth about its often tawdry business was laid bare on Thursday evening during a media conference call to publicise the world heavyweight title fight between Tyson Fury and Dillian Whyte at Wembley Stadium on 23 April. Earlier this week the biggest boxing news story of the year broke when the US Treasury announced that they had imposed harsh sanctions against Daniel Kinahan, one of the most powerful men in the sport, who has acted as a confidante and adviser to Fury and many other leading fighters in Britain and the United States. The US government also warned all fighters and promoters who have worked with Kinahan to cut ties with him owing to his alleged leadership of a criminal cartel. Yet, on a Zoom call featuring up to a hundred journalists, not one question was put to Fury, or his promoters Bob Arum and Frank Warren, about the damage done to boxing’s already battered reputation. Those reporters invited to offer their queries to Fury chose to focus exclusively on routine questions about the buildup to the fight and the world champion’s exuberant mood as he prepares to defend his titles against Whyte before a crowd of 94,000 a week on Saturday. Meanwhile, journalists who work outside the parochial boxing media, and were itching to ask Fury how he felt about the sanctions imposed on Kinahan, were left frustrated. All the media were muted until called and so there was no way of breaking the omerta of silence that engulfs boxing when it comes to discussing the deeply troubling influence of Kinahan. Based in Dubai, and in exile from his native Ireland where he and his family face multiple allegations of criminal activity, Kinahan has been a source of great support to multiple boxers. They all swear by his loyalty and generosity to them. Last year Fury took to social media to praise the crucial role Kinahan had played in arranging a hugely lucrative showdown between him and Anthony Joshua. That fight failed to materialise after a US judge ruled that Fury was contractually bound to meet Deontay Wilder first. Since then Kinahan’s power base in boxing has spread significantly and two companies closely associated with him, MTK and Probellum, have expanded. Kinahan, who has no criminal convictions, has always denied any wrongdoing. Last month it seemed as if he had taken another giant step forward in his concerted campaign to clean up his reputation. Mauricio Sulaiman, the head of the World Boxing Council, lamented the fact that Kinahan was “a character who has been crossed out and labelled as a person linked to criminal groups, thus creating prejudice against a large part of the world boxing community.” Sulaiman defended Kinahan vigorously and stressed he “will have our full support in his quest to bring benefits to boxing.” Yet this week in Dublin, at a very different kind of press conference, the US government offered a reward of $5m for information that would lead to the financial disruption or the arrest or conviction of Kinahan, his father, his brother and four of their associates. Gregory Gatjanis, an associate director of the US Office of Foreign Assets Control, said the Kinahan cartel would now be prioritised by US law enforcement in the same way it had pursued the Italian Camorra, the Yakuza mafia of Japan and the Russian Izmaylovskaya. On Thursday evening, in the muted and fawning world of Zoom, it was as if this story had never happened. Fury is a highly intelligent world champion who has done substantial work in developing a wider understanding of mental health. He is confident and smart enough to deal with almost any media query. It would have been fascinating to hear Fury’s thoughts on the seismic events of this week – both for Kinahan and for boxing. Instead there was hot air and silence. An eminent news and investigative journalist, who works outside of the red-light district of boxing, had waited an hour to ask a question. Like so many, his opportunity never came and so he wrote just one accurate word to the rest of us on the call: “Embarrassing.”",Sport/Sport,Tyson Fury pre-fight Zoom conference ducks questions over Daniel Kinahan,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/14/embarrassing-boxing-ignores-daniel-kinahan-questions-in-tyson-fury-dillian-whyte-buildup
