2/1/2022,"One hundred photographs chronicling the private world of Pablo Picasso up to and after his death in 1973 at the age of 91 have been donated to the Musée de l’Élysée in Switzerland. The pictures are a sample of 25,000 taken of the artist by David Douglas Duncan, an American war photographer who first met Picasso in Cannes in 1956.  Duncan’s first photo of Picasso was of him soaping himself in the bath in his La Californie home moments after the two had first met. After opportunistically ringing the bell at the villa’s front gate in the hope of capturing an image of the world’s most famous painter, Duncan was astonished to find himself being led up to the bathroom by the artist’s wife, Jacqueline. Duncan, who died in 2018, became a firm friend of the Spanish-born painter despite their difficulties in communicating. Picasso did not speak English and he would laugh at Duncan’s grasp of Spanish. But Duncan, who had covered the Korean war as a photojournalist, found himself allowed to come and go as he pleased at Picasso’s various homes during a 17-year friendship. Despite being keenly aware of his legacy, and becoming perhaps the most photographed artist ever, Duncan claimed that Picasso did not pose or demand to be captured on film at any point. The man he called maestro throughout their friendship instead told him: “You take pictures, I paint.” Duncan’s photos were taken with a custom-built Leica M3D camera with extremely quiet shutters so that Picasso would not be disturbed as he worked. Asked in 2012 about the artist’s working habits and character, Duncan told the French newspaper Le Monde that he could not reconcile claims of misogyny with the man he knew, and he regarded him as a dedicated “Spanish gentleman”. “For this one – Les Baigneurs – it lasted two days and two nights. He could stop and sit down in front of a painting for half an hour, quite motionless, just looking at it, with one hand on his head. No movement. He was thinking,” he recalled. “One day when I was there, someone asked him which period of his work he liked best, the blue period, the rose period, cubism and so on. Picasso stretched out his hand, his fingers splayed, and answered: ‘Well, which of these five fingers do you prefer? Personally, I need all of them.’”",Arts/Art and design,"‘You take pictures, I paint’: Picasso friend’s photos given to Swiss museum",https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/31/picasso-friend-david-douglas-duncan-photos-swiss-museum
2/1/2022,"As the world returns to the office, doggy daycare is booming. You hear of kingpins who never even have to meet the dogs, but run establishments packed with canines, whose owners are each paying more for the day than the dog-loving apprentices are receiving. They offer “enrichment activities” – AKA other dogs with buttholes – and nap time, which is to say, all day. Sorry, that is unfair. There are also many fine and upstanding dog lovers providing these services, and right across the spectrum, everyone reports a surge in demand as people who got a lockdown puppy now have a regular, grownup dog. But it’s a dog with a difference. It can’t be left alone for one second. Dog behaviourists report weird, amazingly strategic new methods to stop owners going out: dogs that will hide shoes, lie down across front doors, or – in the case of one high-risk fellow – across the rear wheels of a car. Realistically, what’s the upside, for a dog, of anyone leaving the house? You can hardly blame them, but you have now created an animal that needs £40 a day spent on it just to stay sane. You might as well have bought a lockdown racehorse.  I’m wondering what this all means for the lockdown spouse, the cherished life partner who worked at home anyway, but has now spent two years getting used to constant company. Which is to say, I’m wondering what it means for me. I complained constantly throughout 2020 about the limits on my considerable pre-Covid freedom. I used to live as if in a fairytale or dream – totally normal on the surface, then, wham, 9am, the final person would leave and the home was my castle, or my oyster, or whatever. Sometimes I’d work, sometimes I’d just stare. I could feast on crisp sandwiches and solve the tea/coffee dilemma by making both at the same time. Once the lockdowns began I formed a support group-cum-prayer-tree with other people who had previously worked from home alone, where we’d swap recent outrages. On one occasion, a friend’s formerly office-based wife told him what time there was a break in her meeting, in case he wanted to bring her a cup of tea. Another friend exploded: “All he does is Zoom! Zoom Zoom Zoom, always more Zoom, every word is Zoom, everywhere I go I can hear the Zoom!,” and we thought she was making a strong point, while having a nervous breakdown. I could discuss this stuff for hours, except I’d have to go for a walk to do so, because how are you supposed to bitch about people who are always in? Then, finally, we all got used to it, and one second after that, the company was more like a necessity or a birthright. I want someone around when a package arrives – not so that they’ll open the door, or maybe that, too, but someone reliable, someone invested. Someone who will celebrate the arrival of a heated pet pad or some pasta made of yellow peas. I want to be able to say: “What’s that word beginning with S?” into not-a-void. I want to eavesdrop on someone else’s meeting and ask questions about the future too banal for a phone call. If I do anything at all pro-social, anything domestic or thoughtful, I want it to be observed in the moment. Then I want a medal. If I hear a noise on the street, I want to ask someone else what they think it was, and if the sun comes out, I want to be only one of two simultaneous voices saying, “Look, the sun’s come out.” I don’t even want to think about what would happen if there were to be a rainbow, with me the only witness. I want to peer into the flats opposite and make suppositions about their relationships and housekeeping, like in Rear Window. I’ve acclimatised so completely to this unboundaried life – is he a co-worker or a flatmate or a partner, or are we actually both students? – that I can’t imagine life after it.

2/1/2022,"Nobody was expecting Frank Lampard to conduct his first interview as manager of Everton atop an overturned blue bucket and with a copy of Inverting the Pyramid tucked neatly under his arm. But many a Blue Nose was left scratching the their heads on Monday afternoon at the Hollyoaks-soaked introduction, as well as what actual tactics Lamps might use to dig the Toffees out of the almighty mess they are in: four points off the relegation zone in 16th place, with over half a billion notes of Moshiri’s moolah down the pan.  Instead, Lamps put on a clinic in “heart”, “fight” and “ambition” and much like Augustus Gloop and Ferenc Puskás, insisted he was “hungry” to get started. In fact, the word “passion” was mentioned 10 times in the first three and a half minutes of said interview, at an average of once every 21 seconds – a little glimpse into the half-time team talks to come. Lampard was probably a little lucky to get the Chelsea job in 2019 and a tad unlucky to lose it just over a year ago. But as the appointment of Tactics Tommy [Tuchel] has shown, a little bit more Double Pivot and a little less “desire” had quite the effect at Chelsea. Some people have questioned Lampardia, what it all means, and where it came from and where it might take us. Was his early success at Derby because he galvanised a bunch of underachievers to a Championship play-off berth, via a gegenpress and triple overlap the likes of which had never been seen in the second tier, or more to do with the fact that he passioned Chelsea loanees Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori to within an inch of their lives, into a division that was well beneath them? The jury remains out. But fear not, now he’s back in the managerial saddle, Lamps is talking tough again. “After speaking to the owner, chairman and the board, I very much felt their passion and ambition,” Frank Lamparded. “I hope they felt my ambition and how hard I want to work to bring it together. You can feel the passion Everton fans have for their club. I think Everton is a unique club in that you can really understand what the fans want to see. The first thing they want is fight and desire and that must always be our baseline. “I keep saying the words passion [you’re not wrong, pal!] and fight and I think it related to Everton Football Club,” he unfortunately continued. “It’s probably how I tried to build my own career as a player.” That’s all very well, Frank, but on top of your Work Ethic™, you also happened to have one of the best right foots in the business, a couple of lungs the size of Dixie Dean’s shorts and an unerring ability to be in the right place at the right time.

2/1/2022,"My friend Mike Owen, who has died aged 83, was a merchant navy engineer who became a world-renowned expert in the field of fluid mechanics and jet engines. Born in Cheam, Surrey, to Charles, an electrical engineer, and Ruth Hadfield, a forewoman at an electrical company, Mike went to Epsom grammar school until he was 16, when he started a marine engineering apprenticeship with Esso in 1954, spending two years at college, two years at sea and then a final year back at college and in workshops.  Afterwards he remained with Esso, becoming a second engineer at the early age of 23 before studying mechanical engineering at King’s College, Durham (now Newcastle University), during which time he married Doreen Chapman in 1964. Graduating with a first-class degree the following year, he then set off with Doreen for Canada, where he had landed a job as a research engineer in fluid machinery with Crippen Consultants in Vancouver, testing scale models of dams, spillways and rivers for the hydro-electric power stations that would be constructed as part of the Fraser River Project in British Columbia. A year later he was invited by the new University of Sussex to come back home and work on a Rolls-Royce-funded project on the fluid mechanics of rotating discs. At Sussex he combined research with his love of walking the South Downs, climbing with the university club and making beer. He added a DPhil and later a DSc to his academic honours. During 20 years at Sussex, Mike supervised many research students, grants and contracts funded by government and international gas turbine companies, becoming director of the Thermo-Fluid Mechanics Research Centre at the university. In 1989, having further established his reputation with a two-volume book, Flow and Heat Transfer in Rotating-Disc Systems, published that year and co-authored with Ruth Rogers, he became chair of the University of Bath’s Department of Mechanical Engineering, where he wrote more than 100 journal and conference papers, plus other books. His experimental and theoretical work centred around research on jet engines, and one of his most notable achievements was to set up the now world-renowned Centre for Rotating Flows at Bath: he became its head of school and department. He formally retired in 2003 but carried on his research at Bath and was writing scientific papers right up to his last few days. Mike was always very fit, walking long distances and cycling up and down the hills around Bath. He enjoyed sailing and also loved to deliver a funny story with an unexpected twist at the end. He is survived by Doreen, their daughters, Julie and Sharon, and seven grandchildren.",News/Education,Mike Owen obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/31/mike-owen-obituary
2/1/2022,"He had spent 43 years in prison, and a spell on death row, for a murder he did not commit. In 2019 Charles Ray Finch, an African American man from North Carolina now in his 80s, was finally set free. “He went in at age 40, the prime of his life, and he came out in a wheelchair having suffered a stroke, and he suffered another stroke since then,” says David Rudolf, a criminal defence lawyer who worked on the case. “His whole life was taken from him. That was a particularly tragic circumstance.”  Now Rudolf, 72, has interwoven Finch’s life story with his own in a book, American Injustice, that offers a bracing account of abuses of power and corruption in the criminal justice system. It tells how over the past 30 years more than 2,800 innocent American prisoners – their combined sentences exceeding 25,000 years – have been exonerated and freed after miscarriages of justice. This, Rudolf argues, is only a fraction of the actual number of people wrongfully accused and convicted over the same period. “We should be worried just from the statistics we know right now because obviously that’s the tip of the iceberg,” says the lawyer, exuding a bearded, bespectacled and genial presence via Zoom from Toronto, Canada, where he is doing legal work. “Those are the people who were lucky enough to find lawyers, then lucky enough to have those lawyers find the evidence they needed and then lucky enough to be able to litigate it successfully, overcoming all kinds of odds and the whole preference for finality in the criminal justice system over justice or truth.” How do wrongful convictions happen? In taking the reader through numerous crime scenes, Rudolf identifies misconduct at all levels of law enforcement such as concealing evidence of the defendant’s innocence, confirmation bias, suggestive procedures that make an eyewitness identification of a suspect more likely, fabricating or planting evidence, and coercing innocent people into giving false confessions. The case of Finch, convicted in 1976 of murdering a grocery shop clerk during an attempted robbery, was particularly egregious, the consequence of a sheriff’s department covering up its own corruption. A store employee who saw the killer flee the scene told police that the killer had been wearing a three-quarter-length coat. An eyewitness later identified Finch in three different lineups. But working with Duke University’s Wrongful Convictions Clinic at a 2013 hearing, Rudolf cross-examined the then chief deputy sheriff and, in what he describes in the book as a “Perry Mason moment”, demonstrated that Finch had been forced to wear a coat that made the lineup procedure unduly suggestive. Rudolf says now: “It’s one of the few cases where I can honestly say that a police officer set out to frame an innocent person. In most of these cases – let me stress this – I don’t think police are setting out to frame innocent people. “Through a combination of their hubris and experience and confirmation bias, they walk into a scene and say it was a murder, then everything gets filtered through that lens and you have confirmation bias and tunnel vision and all the things that I talk about. “I think that’s 98% of how wrongful convictions occur, whether it’s a false confession, planting evidence, fake science, whatever the mechanism is. I don’t think that’s as important as the motivation. What I really wanted to cast a light on in this book was motivations and their impact on the people.” Speaking of motivations, the 2020 police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis delivered a brutal reminder of systemic racism. Rudolf, a New Yorker who worked as a public defender in the South Bronx then practiced law for decades in North Carolina, says the warping effect of racism is most evident when the victim is white and the defendant is a person of colour. “I’ve been in trials where prosecutors have challenged every Black juror for reasons that were obviously, patently, transparently racial. There’s been studies done of jury selection in North Carolina made it clear that prosecutors were knocking people off because they were Black, for no other reason. In that setting, it’s pretty overt.” Such findings are a crystal clear indictment of capital punishment. Finch, for example, was initially sentenced to death but this was reduced to life in prison after the supreme court declared North Carolina’s mandatory death penalty unconstitutional. American Injustice also highlights the plight of Henry McCollum and his half brother Leon Brown, convicted of the 1983 rape and murder of an 11-year-old girl; McCollum spent three decades on death row. Antonin Scalia, the late supreme court justice, cited the case to justify capital punishment in a legal opinion, contending that lethal injection would offer a “quiet death” compared with the victim’s. But it was all a lie. Rudolf says: “Now we flash forward to 2018, 19. The two men have been completely exonerated. There’s a lawsuit filed against the police who essentially caused their wrongful conviction, and a jury in eastern North Carolina awards $75m to these two mentally handicapped brothers. This is the case that Scalia held up as the poster child for the death penalty and these guys were stone cold fucking innocent. What does that tell you?” It might be assumed that the march of science, in particular DNA evidence, should make wrongful convictions less likely now than in the past. Not necessarily, says Rudolf, noting the growth of an “experts” industrial complex that is far from neutral. “It’s a double-edged sword because 50 years ago we didn’t have things like blood spatter experts, dental experts, tyre impression experts, shoe impression experts. We didn’t have this whole plethora of pseudo-experts who are not scientists; they are laypeople. They’re mostly law enforcement and their way of validating their opinions is: did the jury or did the jury not convict? If the jury convicted, hey, they got it right! That’s absurd.” To illustrate the point, Rudolf cites his most famous case - featured in the Netflix documentary series The Staircase – in which Michael Peterson, a novelist in North Carolina, was convicted of first-degree murder after the death of his wife in 2001 and sentenced to life without parole. The jury’s verdict had turned on evidence provided by a blood spatter expert, Duane Deaver, which Rudolf was sure was not supported by science. In 2011, he was able to prove that Deaver had lied on the witness stand about his conclusions. Peterson was released and eventually sentenced to time served. “Duane Deaver is hired to come in to the scene at the Peterson house. The detective says, ‘I think this is a murder. Can you come in and take a look at this?’ He’s on the homicide team. So is he going to say to the homicide detective, ‘You know, I think you’re full of shit, this was a fall’? “No! His confirmation bias is to help his fellow law enforcement officer. That’s natural. We would all be subject to that. So I’m not being especially critical of that. I’m just saying, let’s recognise it for what it is.” Rudolf never expected The Staircase to be such a hit and believes it challenged negative perceptions of his profession. “People came to see the criminal justice system in a much more nuanced way and that was my goal. When I grew up, Perry Mason, the criminal defence lawyer, was a hero. Matlock was a hero. These weren’t sleazy people. These were people who were trying to find the truth and who would actually exonerate people. “Those were my role models growing up and then all of a sudden we get to Law and Order and all the defence lawyers are drunks and they don’t give a fuck, and they’re sleazy, and that was the public perception. “It made me angry and so I thought to myself, it would be interesting if people could really see what we criminal defence lawyers do, that we’re not sleazy, that we’re actually trying to find the truth, that sometimes the truth is elusive, but we have a role to play that’s important and we do our jobs conscientiously with as much faithfulness as prosecutors and sometimes more.” He adds: “I can tell you that I have received hundreds, if not thousands, of comments from people who say, ‘You really changed my view of what criminal defence lawyers do. I had no idea.’ That’s gratifying to me, not for myself but for everybody who does what I do. All of a sudden if those people go into a jury box they’re not viewing the defence lawyer as a sleazebag, so it levelled the playing field a little bit. That’s something I’m proud of.” Such was the success of The Staircase that it is being turned into a TV mini-series starring Colin Firth and Toni Collette. Rudolf spent time with the actor Michael Stuhlbarg, who will portray him on screen. “I said to him I was proud of what came out of The Staircase in terms of criminal defence lawyers and how people viewed us and your TV series could either reinforce that or it could totally smash that, and I want to let you know how important it is to me that you play this in a way that’s true to what was in that documentary. I’m not talking about guilt or innocence or any of that stuff. I’m talking about what we do and how we do it.” Rudolf is also getting his message out with a podcast called Abuse of Power, co-hosted with his wife and law partner, Sonya Pfeiffer. Late in his career, he has discovered the power of media megaphones. “I decided that rather than talking to 12 people in a jury box, I could talk to 12,000 people or 120,000 people on a podcast or who knows how many people in a book,” he adds. “That’s how change gets made. It gets made incrementally with a particular jury, but it gets made a lot quicker with this.” American Injustice is out now",Arts/Books,‘It’s the tip of the iceberg’: shining a light on the horror of wrongful convictions,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/31/david-rudolf-american-injustice-interview
2/1/2022,"Although the phrase “All politics is local” is usually attributed to Tip O’Neill Jr, a former speaker of the US House of Representatives, the aphorism probably originated in the February 1932 Associated Press column “Politics at Random”, when the Washington bureau chief, Byron Price, wrote: “All politics is local politics.” As valid as Price’s summarization of inside-the-Beltway politics may be, there is probably a more accurate way to describe the All American sport of civic power-brokering: All politics is racial.  Over the last quarter-century, white voters have overwhelmingly identified with the GOP while every other racial and ethnic group – Black, Hispanic and Asian American voters – consistently identify with the Democratic party. This unwavering reality reduces the machinations of each political party to a game of demographic mathematics, especially in racially diverse parts of the country, where one truisim dominates local politics: when non-white people can’t vote, Republicans win. Perhaps the starkest example of this racial divide is Alabama, where white people make up 69% of the population and are 89% of the Republican electorate. By comparison, the state is 27% African American, 80% of whom identify as Democrat. Six of the seven Democrats in the Alabama senate are Black, as are 26 of the 27 Democratic members of the house. In 2022, Kenneth Paschal became the first Black person to represent the Republican party in the Alabama state legislature since Reconstruction. Contrary to what Price would say, politics is not local here. In Alabama, regardless of the location, “white voter” is synonymous with “Republican” and “Black” means “Democrat”. Perhaps this reality is why last Monday, a federal court threw out the state’s congressional map that disenfranchised Black voters across the state. The three-judge panel explained that the congressional redistricting plan created by Alabama’s Republican-controlled legislature meant that “Black voters have less opportunity than other Alabamians to elect candidates of their choice to Congress.” The previous map packed the two Blackest cities in one congressional district, splitting the rest of the state’s Black population – three of the five largest cities in the state – among three majority-white districts that have been safely Republican for years. The judges gave the white (Republican) lawmakers 14 days to draw new districts that did not violate the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Alabama Republicans vowed to appeal the ruling to the US supreme court, where the court’s conservative majority ruled in 2019 that disenfranchising Black voters is perfectly fine as long as the gerrymanderers’ intent was partisan and not racial. “If district lines were drawn for the purpose of separating racial groups, then they are subject to strict scrutiny because ‘race-based decisionmaking is inherently suspect,” wrote Chief Justice John Roberts in the majority opinion. “But determining that lines were drawn on the basis of partisanship does not indicate that the districting was improper. A permissible intent – securing partisan advantage – does not become constitutionally impermissible, like racial discrimination, when that permissible intent “predominates”. Herein lies the problem with politics, conservative ideology and America in general. For years, there has been a subtle campaign to redefine racism by the intent and not the effects of discriminatory actions. According to this new American translation, disenfranchising entire communities by suppressing their voting power is not necessarily racist as long as the person didn’t mean to be racist. And, because there are very few people willing to stand in front of the world and confess to their racial prejudices, anyone is allowed to discriminate as long as they don’t articulate their racism out loud. However, this cleverly constructed loophole only applies to racism. America’s jurisprudence system has found a way to convict people for unintentional murder and hold people accountable for car accidents, but somehow white people are innocent until proven racist. But in the case of the Alabama Republican-controlled legislature, there is actual proof. A few weeks after justices sitting on America’s highest court decided that there was nothing they could do about North Carolina disenfranchising hundreds of thousands of Black citizens, the daughter of the man who pioneered using race to redraw political maps leaked the contents of her recently deceased father’s hard drive, revealing that North Carolina’s redistricting plan was about race all along. Known as the “Master of the Modern Gerrymander”, Thomas Hofeller had only considered race when drawing the maps for North Carolina. The proposed maps even included a plan that would have allowed the state to elect an all-white legislature. But the leaked files also revealed that Hofeller was the main architect of redistricting plans for states across the country, including Alabama. Hofeller’s files included emails and proposals from then Alabama state House redistricting commission chair Representative Jim McClendon, who included racial data, census maps broken down by race and … well, nothing else. The basis for McClendon and Hofeller’s plan for Alabama wasn’t mostly about race; it seems as if it was only about race. After serving in the Alabama house for 12 years, McClendon was elected to the state senate in 2014, where he co-chaired the senate commission whose gerrymandered maps were thrown out by the federal court. It was probably a coincidence. I’m sure he didn’t mean to do it. Alabama is not an outlier in this phenomenon. Republican-controlled legislatures in Georgia, Tennessee, Texas, Missouri and Wisconsin have submitted gerrymandered maps that diminish the power of Black voters. Of course, they won’t admit that the redistricting plans are solely motivated by race because, according to the New American definition, that would make it racist. According to America’s highest legal authorities, there is nothing wrong with stealing the voices of Black people and accidentally murdering their opportunity to participate in democracy. After all, it has nothing to do with racism. It’s just politics.

2/1/2022,"This is a disturbing, deeply upsetting Czech documentary about the threat of online child abuse. It is not something I would normally choose to watch and it left me feeling sick to the stomach. But it is an important film on an urgent issue and perhaps should be required viewing for parents. The set-up is like a reality TV or tabloid gotcha. Film-makers Barbora Chalupová and Vít Klusák cast three young-looking actors to play 12-year-old girls. For 10 days in bedrooms built in a studio, the “girls” live chat and message men on sites such as Facebook and Skype, where they are groomed, coerced and blackmailed. The women work to a code of conduct: they’re not allowed to make approaches, only to respond to messages; and must always say their age, 12, at the beginning of conversations. Psychologists and lawyers are on standby.  The abuse begins almost immediately. “Hi you’re pretty and sweet,” messages one guy. A man on live chat: “What grade are you in?” When the actor replies seventh grade, which would make her 12 or 13, the man’s hand goes straight down his pants. There’s some nervous giggling to begin with in the studio (the directors often pull back the camera to show the film-making process). But it gets dark quickly. The men range in age from late 20s to pensioners, faces blurred except for eyes and lips (the effect is unnerving). Their predatory behaviour runs the gamut. A youngish man with clenched, seething body language and a nasty smirk is a blackmailer: he coerces one of them into sending him nude photos then threatens to publish them. Another man is a groomer with a gentle voice, always smiling: “Hey, sweetie.” This film is a difficult, depressing watch, though at the end in a confrontation with one of the men, the three actors are able to take back power.

Gray’s conclusion is general, after police asked her to remove details of the majority of alleged events, which are being investigated for alleged offences, but damning in parts. At a time when ministers were asking citizens to severely limit their lives, “some of the behaviour surrounding these gatherings is difficult to justify”, she wrote. Some gatherings “represent a serious failure to observe not just the high standards expected of those working at the heart of government but also of the standards expected of the entire British population at the time”, she said, adding: “There were failures of leadership and judgment by different parts of No 10 and the Cabinet Office at different times. Some of the events should not have been allowed to take place. Other events should not have been allowed to develop as they did.” Gray’s report looked at 16 gatherings, on 12 dates between May 2020 and April 2021. Of these, the Metropolitan police are not looking at four of them. One alleged incident has not been previously reported, on 14 January 2021. It is described as “a gathering in No 10 Downing Street on the departure of two No 10 private secretaries”. There is a particularly strongly worded section outlining how the police asked last week that Gray edit her report so that it not contain details of the events it was investigating. Gray makes it plain this should not be seen as the final word on the parties: “Unfortunately, this necessarily means that I am extremely limited in what I can say about those events and it is not possible at present to provide a meaningful report setting out and analysing the extensive factual information I have been able to gather.” To do so would be impossible “without detriment to the overall balance of the findings”, Gray said. Having turned over information about the 12 alleged events to police, Gray said she would ensure the “secure storage and safekeeping of all the information gathered until such time as it may be required further”, adding: “I will not be circulating the information internally within government.” Gray’s quote speaks for itself: “The excessive consumption of alcohol is not appropriate in a professional workplace at any time. Steps must be taken to ensure that every government department has a clear and robust policy in place covering the consumption of alcohol in the workplace.” While saying it was “sensible” to hold outdoor staff meetings in the garden, Gray said the garden “was also used for gatherings without clear authorisation or oversight”. Some staff wanted to raise concerns, the report found, “but at times felt unable to do so”. Gray added: “No member of staff should feel unable to report or challenge poor conduct where they witness it.” The number of staff has grown to near-departmental size, the report said, but leadership structures “are fragmented and complicated”. The report noted: “Tight knit groups of officials and advisers worked long hours under difficult conditions in buildings that could not be easily adapted as Covid secure workplaces.” The report went on: “Those challenges, however, also applied to key and frontline workers across the country who were working under equally, if not more, demanding conditions, often at risk to their own health.”",News/Politics,What Sue Gray’s edited report into alleged lockdown parties says,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/31/what-sue-gray-edited-report-into-alleged-lockdown-parties-says
2/1/2022,"Austria has lifted its “lockdown of the unvaccinated”, Switzerland is gearing up for a “turbo” reopening and Germany’s finance minister has demanded an end date for Covid curbs as more countries prepare to ease pandemic controls. It follows the Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium and France, who last week began to take steps to return to a semblance of normal life, with the Danish government declaring Covid-19 “should no longer be categorised as a socially critical disease” after 31 January.  Although infections, driven by the highly transmissible Omicron variant, are still hitting record highs, data continues to show hospital and intensive care admissions are not surging in line with cases. Austria’s chancellor, Karl Nehammer, said that from next Saturday, shops and restaurants would be able to stay open until midnight and the maximum number of people able to participate in events would rise from 25 to 50. The country this week also became the first EU member state to make vaccination legally compulsory for adults under a law making those who refuse the jab liable for fines of up to €3,600 from mid-March, after an introductory phase. Nehammer’s announcement came as Austria lifted a lockdown that – while proving difficult to enforce – has in principle barred those who have not been jabbed from leaving their home except for essential reasons since 15 November. Restrictions on movement for the unvaccinated were lifted on Monday, although they remain barred from eating in restaurants or shopping for non-essential items as part of government efforts to boost western Europe’s lowest vaccination rate. So-called “2G” rules banning those who have not been been vaccinated or recovered from the virus from non-essential shops will end on 12 February, with restaurants and tourist attraction also open to those with just a recent negative test a week later. New daily coronavirus infections have been rising in Austria, but pressure on hospitals has eased and the wave is expected to reach a peak on around 7 February, the public health director, Katharina Reich, said. In Switzerland, meanwhile, experts who studied both Swiss and German infection rates said Omicron was significantly more infectious, but seemingly less severe, than the Delta variant and was “unlikely to cause record numbers of admissions to ICUs”. The finding followed a call last week by an alliance of Swiss businesses and rightwing parties to ease curbs – including working from home rules and a Covid pass needed to enter indoor public places such as restaurants, cinemas and gyms – that the group said were “disproportionate” and causing “enormous suffering” to companies. Amid estimates that up to 40% of Swiss companies were experiencing staff shortages due to quarantine rules, the Swiss health minister, Alain Berset, has called for remaining restrictions to be lifted from 16 February, saying he wanted a “turbo” reopening of the economy. Germany’s finance minister, Christian Lindner, also said the government should be laying the foundations for a smooth return to normal, arguing that even though the peak of the Omicron wave may still be several weeks away, business required a “planning horizon”. Data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control on Monday suggested that the country, which is recording record high infections numbers, had failed to hit its goal of vaccinating 80% of the population before the end of January. As of Monday, 75.8% of Germans had received at least one vaccine dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, putting the country behind other large European countries including Italy, France and Spain. German MPS are expected to vote next month on making vaccinations mandatory. The World Health Organization has said it is “plausible” that the Omicron variant, which seems to cause less severe symptoms in the fully vaccinated, may signal the pandemic’s transition towards a more “manageable” phase and eventual endgame, but warned the situation remains unpredictable.",News/World news,Austria lifts ‘lockdown of the unvaccinated’ as Europe slowly opens up,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/31/austria-lifts-lockdown-of-unvaccinated-as-europe-opens-up-covid
2/1/2022,"Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and Keir Starmer were among friends and family to attend the funeral of the Labour MP Jack Dromey on Monday. The former leading trade unionist died aged 73 at his flat in his Birmingham constituency of Erdington, which he had represented in Westminster since 2010, on 7 January.  Dromey, who was married to Labour’s former deputy leader Harriet Harman, “remade history many times over” throughout his political career, according to the former prime minister Gordon Brown. He told mourners at the funeral at St Margaret’s Church in Parliament Square, Westminster, to remember his “infectious enthusiasm”, “fighting spirit” and “relentless optimism”. He said: “From the start, Jack had a bigger mission, born of the intensity of his idealism and the courage of his convictions. “He saw wrongs and wanted to right them, injustices and wanted to resolve them, and where there was unfairness, there Jack always was, fighting it. “He was the ‘Jack of all campaigns’. ‘Four quick points’, he’d say when you met him, and there were usually eight. “And when he said ‘finally’ that meant there were at least three more proposals to be acted on, as he ran a seemingly endless succession of landmark, groundbreaking, often life-changing campaigns, and made and remade history many times over.” The former prime minister Tony Blair gave a bible reading, while Dromey’s daughter Amy Harman read an extract from her mother’s book A Woman’s Work. The current Labour leader, Keir Starmer, and deputy leader, Angela Rayner, were among those in attendance, with political figures from both sides of the house present to pay their respects. Starmer tweeted: “Today, we honour and remember our friend, Jack Dromey. Jack was highly respected across parliament for his lived commitment to social justice, which he pursued with humour and grace. “We will miss him. May he rest in peace. The father-of-three is understood to have died from natural causes.” Jess Phillips, the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley, told the PA news agency: “It was brilliant and funny and beautiful and a testimony to Jack. “I just felt very much that Harriet and Jack will be very proud of their children who stood up very bravely and gave brilliant testimonies.” Dromey was born to Irish parents and raised in Kilburn, London. He became heavily involved in the trade unionist movement in the 1970s and had a prominent role in supporting a strike at the Grunwick film processing laboratory from 1976 to 1978, where he met Harman. The couple married in 1982 and had three children. Harman, approaching 40 years in parliament, announced last month she would step down at the next election. Dromey joined the Labour frontbench as shadow housing minister in 2010 under then leader Ed Miliband, who was also at the service. Announcing his death earlier this month, his family said: “He was a much-loved husband, father and grandfather and he will be greatly missed.” A byelection will be held in Dromey’s Birmingham Erdington seat, which Labour has held since it was re-established in 1974.",News/Politics,‘He made and remade history’: funeral held for Labour MP Jack Dromey,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/31/he-made-and-remade-history-funeral-held-for-labour-mp-jack-dromey
2/1/2022,"Belgian civil servants will no longer need to answer emails or phone calls out of hours after the country became the latest in Europe to offer workers the right to disconnect. The law, which comes into effect on Tuesday, means 65,000 federal officials are able to make themselves unavailable at the end of the normal working day unless there are “exceptional” reasons for not doing so.  There are also government plans to extend the right to private-sector employees despite the opposition of some business groups. Petra De Sutter, the Belgian minister for public administration, said the law was necessary to combat a culture of people feeling they should always be available. That perception is said to have been exacerbated by the necessity to work from home during the Covid pandemic, a situation that is likely to lead to permanent changes in people’s habits. In a recent survey on remote working more than four out of five (84%) Belgians, of which 40% held managerial positions, said they would like to continue to work from home for two or more days a week post-pandemic. Without the right to disconnect, said De Sutter, “the result will be stress and burnout and this is the real disease of today”. The federal government is also examining a proposal to move to a four-day week of 38 to 40 hours for full-time staff, meaning longer working days but a three-day weekend. Belgium has followed a trend set in Europe by Volkswagen in Germany, which decided in 2012 to ban certain employees from accessing emails after hours in order to avoid burnout. In France, the sense that a different work-life balance needed to be struck was turned into action in 2017, when organisations with more than 50 workers were required to start negotiations to define the rights of employees to ignore their company smartphones and laptops. Portugal went further last year by approving legislation under which employers with more than 10 staff can be liable to fines if they text message, phone or email workers who are off the clock. Companies must help pay for expenses incurred by remote working. However, the Portuguese parliament rejected a proposal to include a legal right to switch off work-related messages and devices outside office hours. Last November, the European parliament backed a resolution calling on the European Commission to draft an EU-wide law that would protect workers who wished to “disconnect”. Alex Agius Saliba, a Maltese MEP, who drove the vote, said: “We cannot abandon millions of European workers who are exhausted by the pressure to be always ‘on’ and overly long working hours. “Now is the moment to stand by their side and give them what they deserve: the right to disconnect. This is vital for our mental and physical health. It is time to update worker’s rights so that they correspond to the new realities of the digital age.”",News/World news,Belgian civil servants given legal right to disconnect from work,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/31/belgian-civil-servants-given-legal-right-to-disconnect-from-work
2/1/2022,"In the rain-sodden opening to the 1966 black and white BBC documentary, Travelling for a Living, a family of young folk singers are heading home to Hull. Big sister is driving the van, a cigarette pursed in her lips under her sharp, beatnik bob. She brooks absolutely no nonsense as she speaks about working-class culture being blitzed in the war, and how folk music can revive that community’s traditions. And then Norma Waterson sings, her full-blooded delivery coming straight from the gut, like torrenting water rushing over old stones. Waterson, whose death was announced this morning, was one of folk’s greatest voices, and one of folk’s greatest people: proud, forthright and open about the music she made. I interviewed her in 2010 with daughter Eliza, in the family home in Robin Hood’s Bay, Yorkshire, shortly before she suffered an ankle injury that led to cellulitis and septicaemia and a four-month coma. After the illness, she had to learn to walk and talk again. She was brusque and funny but also incredibly tender, her granddaughter Florence at her knee, her musician niece Marry popping round for tea and biscuits, the room filled with laughter. This warmth was at the heart of her as well as her toughness, and it sang loudly in her songs.  Norma’s family band, the Watersons, helped to spearhead the folk revival in the 1960s, playing London’s Royal Albert Hall and touring across the UK. She managed them, prioritising the values of real life above any professional commitments: one week of gigs were always followed by a week off so they could practise together, read books, and spend plenty of time with their children. Her younger sister Lal, brother Mike and she were its core, and they sang together as they had ever since they were children (they were brought up by their grandmother, from a Gypsy family, after their parents died young). Their voices had a bone-jolting beauty together: the title of their first album, Frost and Fire, conveyed their elemental power, as did the ballads they chose to sing on it. Norma was also adventurous in her love of life and music. Following a man she loved to the Caribbean in 1968, she built up a huge calypso record collection there, and became a radio DJ for a few years. Her later records also boldly revealed her interests in music beyond British folk. Her 1996 self-titled solo album debut included songs by The Grateful Dead, Elvis Costello and modern blues and soul singer Ben Harper. Her last album with daughter Eliza Carthy, 2018’s Anchor, saw songs by Tom Waits, Nick Lowe and Eric Idle sitting alongside hardy traditionals. Waterson’s solo album is how I first encountered her. I was a Britpop-era indie kid, watching the Mercury prize on TV, and I remember the lightning bolt of seeing a woman her age – 56 – looking like women I knew from ordinary life, full of charisma and character. She sang gutsily, without any semblance of prettiness or ego. She nearly won the prize, too. So close was the Mercury result that the jury debated for nearly four hours, but characteristically, Norma wasn’t aggrieved. “I wanted to adopt Jarvis,” she told me (Pulp’s Different Class was the eventual winner). “He wanted me to adopt him, too.” The rest of her back catalogue holds numerous treasures, many of them with fascinating edges, rewarding appreciation from different perspectives. Her other two solo albums (1999’s The Very Thought of You and 2001’s Bright Shiny Morning) are more traditional but no less affecting: her take on Scottish ballad Barbara Allen is jolting in its simplicity, a cello and double bass echoing her depths. Her lead vocal on Red Wine and Promises, one of her contributions to sister Lal and brother Mike’s extraordinary 1972 album of folk-rock inspired originals, Bright Phoebus, is another high. Her rendition of a melancholy, drunken night out is accompanied by someone who was, back then, an old friend from the 1960s, Martin Carthy, on guitar: “the cheap red wine in me drunken brain / has left a burning flame in me belly,” she sings lustily. She and Carthy got together and married soon after. The couple kept on keeping things in the family. With daughter, Eliza (named after Norma’s grandmother) they formed Blue Murder and the more traditional Waterson: Carthy; Norma’s rugged voice operated like a central nervous system in both. Her largely unaccompanied 1977 record with Lal, A True Hearted Girl, is also an overlooked beauty, the sisters’ voices clashing and curling together like whipping northern winds. Norma was devastated to lose Lal in 1998, only a week after her cancer diagnosis. At the end of her life, ill-health beleaguered Norma, and the pandemic has been devastating for the family, bringing frightening financial pressures (Eliza recently set up a crowdfunder to help them through the recent winter). Throughout those last years, though, her family kept on bringing music into her life. In 2016, Eliza set up a festival, Normafest in Robin Hood’s Bay, to enable her mum to perform, and hired an old Methodist chapel in their home town to record Anchor live, renting Norma a house next door so she could “watch Corrie” and then come in to do her parts. “She comes alive when she sings,” Eliza said. And so she still does on record and camera, her legacy a living thing, those waters torrenting on.",Arts/Music,Norma Waterson was one of folk’s greatest voices – and greatest people,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/31/norma-waterson-was-one-of-folks-greatest-voices-and-greatest-people
