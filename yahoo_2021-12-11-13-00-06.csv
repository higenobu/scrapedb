12/11/2021,"Law enforcement officials in Alabama say a former contract driver for FedEx admitted to dumping hundreds of packages in a ravine last month, and the man is expected to be arrested on Friday. The suspect is Deandre Rayshaun Charleston, a 22-year-old resident of Adamsville, Alabama, Blount County Sheriff Mark Moon confirmed in a press conference. Moon said the man admitted to dumping packages in five separate incidents between Nov. 17-24. Moon told reporters that Charleston was not in custody as of Friday afternoon because he was working “delivering packages for another company.” However, the man has been cooperated with law enforcement, according to the sheriff, and officials hoped to have him in custody by the end of the day on Friday. Moon said the sheriff's office has five warrants for Charleston for cargo theft, a class D felony. He told reporters that 247 packages valued at approximately $25,000 were unidentifiable or could not be scanned to determine a victim. But approximately 153 packages, worth about $15,000. were accounted for and connected with a victim. Moon added that Charleston “appeared that he was very sorrowful for what he had done and just admitted that he was having some hard times in his life and just made poor choices,” adding that 22-year old told law enforcement officials he recently experienced a death in his family. FedEx kerfuffle: Investigation continues into hundreds of packages dumped in Alabama ravine The sheriff’s office confirmed late last month that deputies guarded the packages that were found near the small town of Hayden in north-central Alabama. FedEx workers later arrived to pick up the packages. After the packages were discovered, FedEx confirmed it would deliver the recovered packages and seek resolutions for the damaged shipments. “The security of our customers’ shipments is a top priority and we are committed to treating our customers’ packages with the utmost care,″ FedEx said in a statement at the time.

12/11/2021,"Iowa deer hunters found a dead mountain lion with a broken snare around its neck Tuesday in Poweshiek County, according to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. Since mountain lions have no legal wildlife status in Iowa, the hunters could have kept the carcass, according to DNR officials, but they voluntarily turned over the 119-pound male cat. ""It is not required that (mountain) lions be reported to the Iowa DNR, however we really appreciate it when they are,"" said Vince Evelsizer, a wildlife biologist with the DNR. ""It helps us all in monitoring their whereabouts and learning more about them."" Evelsizer said the DNR will do testing to potentially determine the mountain lion's background, age and overall health. Mountain lions are the largest of three wildcat species historically documented in Iowa, with lynx and bobcat being the other two. Related: Iowa DNR confirms mountain lion seen in video reportedly taken in Des Moines This year, there were no confirmed reports of mountain lions in Iowa until October. Evelsizer said it's possible that four separate mountain lions have now been spotted, or that one or two mountain lions moved around the state and were reported multiple times. The state had six confirmed reports of mountain lions in 2019, but none in 2020. Since 2000, the DNR has received more than 1,500 reports of mountain lions in Iowa, but most have been unsubstantiated. Yellow lab or shepherd dogs, bobcats, feral cats and deer are often mistaken for mountain lions. There is no evidence that Iowa has a ""self-sustaining breeding population of mountain lions, according to the DNR's Trends in Iowa Wildlife Populations and Harvest report for 2020-21, which also says the department ""has not 'stocked' or introduced mountain lions into the state, nor is there any consideration of doing so,"" despite rumors saying otherwise. In the past 150 years, 19 people in the U.S. have died from mountain lion attacks, according to the DNR. None of the fatalities occurred in Iowa.
