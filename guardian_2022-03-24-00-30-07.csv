3/24/2022,"Book now For thousands of years, humans have struggled to understand consciousness. Poets have examined perceptions of reality and the ‘self’ through experimentation in language and form. Artists have long created complex physical representations of the consciousness, while the priests and philosophers of yesteryear have committed years of study to discovering the truth behind what we call ‘reality’. Today, neuroscientists are investigating the ways in which our brains absorb information and perceive the world around us, and they’re increasingly honing in on the mechanisms of consciousness in the brain. In this fascinating masterclass with Anil Seth, one of the world’s leading neuroscientists in the field of consciousness science, you will learn about the philosophical history of consciousness, and why many still believe it to be beyond scientific understanding. After that, you will discover how our perception of reality is a ‘controlled hallucination’ produced by our brains, and what ‘delusion’ really means, as Anil taps into his two decades of groundbreaking research to make the science - and the magic - behind our conscious experiences more accessible. Gain a new appreciation for one of the greatest and most powerful tools available to you: your brain. Anyone with an interest in understanding more about being human, and how modern tools of neuroscience are helping us to understand the basis of consciousness Understanding consciousness: What is consciousness?

3/24/2022,"House price rises outstripped wage growth in more than 90% of England and Wales last year, according to official data that prompted talk of a possible full-blown “affordability crisis”. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said house prices grew faster than earnings in 91% of local authority districts in 2021. It added that in England a home typically cost an average of 9.1 times earnings – up from 7.9 times earnings in 2020. In 1997 the figure was around 3.5. The data comes in the wake of multiple surveys indicating that, two years on from the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the housing market has been continuing to defy economic conditions. Earlier this month, the Halifax said UK house prices were rising at their fastest rate since 2007. The ONS said housing affordability had worsened in 300 out of 331 local authority areas during 2021. It added that in England average property prices increased by 14% in 2021, while average earnings fell by nearly 1%. Some may be surprised to learn that affordability has “significantly improved” in two of the capital’s priciest locations: the City of London and Westminster. In the latter borough, the house prices to earnings ratio fell to 18.9 times earnings. In 2018 it was almost 25. Kensington and Chelsea in west London remained the least affordable local authority area in England and Wales, with average house prices estimated at 36.5 times the typical annual wage. The jump from 7.9 times to 9.1 times earnings was described as a statistically significant increase. However, the ONS acknowledged that the earnings data included payments to workers who were furloughed during the pandemic. It said its figures were based on actual payments made to employees from company payrolls and that in the case of furloughed workers it had assumed their usual hours. Separate official data from the Land Registry revealed that annual UK house-price inflation was running at 9.6% in January – down slightly on December’s 10% figure. That took the average price tag to £273,762. However, the UK annual rise figure disguises wide regional variations: in London, prices were up 2.2% on a year earlier, while in Wales they leapt 13.9%. The Land Registry said annual price growth for new-build properties was running at 25.4%, which stood out to some observers as startlingly high, though the government body pointed to some issues with the data that might help explain the figure. It said it had made some methodology changes because of the impact of the pandemic on the housing market and that “the processing of new-build properties has been more affected”. Sarah Coles, senior personal finance analyst at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said that, while furlough pay made the affordability figures “look more dramatic,” the UK “may be edging towards an affordability crisis”. Estate agent Savills said: “Rapid house-price growth and rising interest rates are creating a perfect storm for first-time buyers.” The ONS also issued a report stating that private rents paid by tenants in the UK rose by an average of 2.3% in the 12 months to February. However, previous surveys have indicated that many renters faced even bigger hikes. In January the property website Rightmove said private rents in Britain were rising at their fastest rate on record, with the average advertised cost outside London 9.9% higher than a year ago.",Lifestyle/Money,House price growth outstrips wages in 90% of England and Wales,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/23/house-price-growth-outstrips-wages-england-wales
3/24/2022,"It will have come as little surprise to most observers at the annual cricket match played between the Foreign Office and the Commonwealth Secretariat when Elspeth Howe, the wife of the foreign secretary, took her place at the crease in the game played in the grounds of Blenheim Palace in 1986 and was not out after batting what was described as a magnificent five overs. She was privately teased within her family for her public reputation for being formidable, but it was a characteristic she had carried all her life, even before she captained the Wycombe Abbey cricket XI as a schoolgirl. Howe, who has died of cancer aged 90, attracted such adjectives (redoubtable was another favourite) because they were irresistible when describing a woman who was both strong-minded and forceful, intellectually independent and politically powerful, as a result both of her own public activities and her partnership with Geoffrey Howe, the politician whom she married when she was 21 and whose own career she helped to mastermind in tandem with her own. When he was selected as the Conservative parliamentary candidate for the hotly contested safe seat of Reigate, Surrey, before the 1970 election, Elspeth told the selection conference that MPs “need slightly more love and attention than most other breeds of husband”. Julian Critchley, later himself a Tory MP but reporting the event as a journalist, described her contribution as unquestionably the best speech of the evening. All her life she was a committee woman, most notably chairing the Broadcasting Standards Commission from 1997 until 1999 and the Broadcasting Standards Council for four years before that. Her career was garlanded with honours, and in 2001 she became Lady Howe of Idlicote in the first list of “people’s peers”. She and her husband – who had become Lord Howe of Aberavon in 1992 – were among the few couples to sit in the Lords each in their own right. She was committed to public service, in particular to improving educational opportunities for girls and women, and to securing equality at work for women. Her first important public appointment was as the first deputy chair, effectively representing the Conservative party, on the newly established Equal Opportunities Commission, set up by the then Labour government in 1975 to enforce the Sex Discrimination Act passed that year. Her experience strengthened the independence of her thinking and gave her an international platform. Once, when she addressed a group of Kenyan women, her speech was reported under the headline “British Sex Act Explained”. However, when her husband was appointed chancellor in 1979, she felt obliged to resign and attracted some derogatory criticism from the feminists of the day for so doing. Her political influence was not restrained by her lack of public office, however. One of her greatest achievements, almost completely unnoticed and certainly unsung, was to set in train a reform of the tax system to give equal treatment to married women. She persuaded her husband of this case and he spent four years attempting unsuccessfully to change the system, battling against the opposition of Margaret Thatcher. According to Nigel Lawson, who succeeded Geoffrey Howe at the Treasury, it was the prime minister’s belief that Elspeth Howe was behind the move for such a long overdue reform that fuelled her rejection of it. A further five years of negotiation took place before Lawson was able to announce the radical step of introducing independent taxation of married women in his 1988 budget. Elspeth Howe was never going to be the sort of woman that Thatcher would like, even if she had not campaigned in support of the homeless and in direct criticism of the government by sleeping in the streets of Westminster in a black bin liner, something that went down badly at No 10. But she was not only fierce in pursuit of a feminism that Thatcher did not recognise, but also a representative of the sort of intellectual elite of which the prime minister was inherently suspicious. In addition, Thatcher was, of course, only too aware of the potential threat of Elspeth’s aspirations for her husband, who had stood unsuccessfully for the leadership of the Tory party in 1975 and who was eventually to prove Thatcher’s nemesis. But despite Alan Clark’s bitchy assertion that Geoffrey’s devastating Commons’ resignation speech showed “Elspeth’s hand in every line” and that the “entire text is the work of Elspeth”, Geoffrey himself rebutted this and claimed that his wife had asked of the speech: “Are you sure you need to go that far?” Elspeth spent her childhood in Bath. She was the daughter of the fourth marriage of Philip Morton Shand, the author, architectural critic, bon vivant and food writer. He married her mother, Sybil (nee Sissons), eight days after divorcing his third wife and it was related that this was the happiest of his marriages. His first marriage had produced a son who became the father of Camilla Shand, now the Duchess of Cornwall. P Morton Shand was an exotic character with distinguished friends and his children benefited in consequence. Elspeth recalled him as a brilliant conversationalist and a great intellect. He was much given to declamations such as “a woman who cannot make soup should not be allowed to marry” and told Elspeth that she could marry anyone she liked “so long as he isn’t a lawyer, a politician or a Welshman”. He accepted her decision to marry, in 1953, a man who was all three of those things but there was a last-minute crisis which says much about Elspeth and her upbringing. She had told her future husband that she was not prepared to undertake to obey him, according to the text of the traditional marriage service, but he had forgotten about this until the day of their wedding in London, when he was already seated in St Peter’s, Vere Street. He then discovered that the officiating minister was not prepared to accept the change. The news was broken to the bride by the best man on the steps of the church, but she agreed to go ahead nevertheless, while relating later that she gave her vows with her fingers crossed. After their three children were born, she became involved in London and Conservative politics in the Bow Group. She was a magistrate and served on a number of bodies dealing with legal aid, parole and the appointment of other magistrates. She held positions on numerous committees in local government, the representation of women, the profession of nursing, the future of education and local government. She was also a director with a number of significant business appointments and still managed to be in the Commons whenever her husband had to make an important speech. When Geoffrey was chancellor, Elspeth became a mature student at the London School of Economics and took a degree in economics and social administration. This led to some misplaced comment after she asked her husband to borrow a book on her behalf from the Commons library and questions were asked about why the chancellor of the exchequer had asked for a book on The Principles of Elementary Economics. She was still at the LSE when he became foreign secretary and one of her contemporaries, a fellow mature student called Kurt Stengl, reputedly an Austrian fridge engineer, who attended “student parties” at the foreign secretary’s residence at No 1 Carlton Gardens, was later revealed to be a KGB placeman. Elspeth, known as “Heppy” to her friends, never relented from her commitments. Even in her 80s, she was one of the most active members of the lords, with a record of participation far exceeding most of her colleagues. She retired in 2020, aged 88. Geoffrey Howe died in 2015. Elspeth is survived by their three children, Cary, Amanda and Alec.

3/24/2022,"Two Caribbean islands that once belonged to the late sex offender and financier Jeffrey Epstein have been put up for sale, according to a new report. Great St James and Little St James, two islands in the US Virgin Islands, were part of Epstein’s extensive global property portfolio and have been listed for $125m, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. The larger island, Great St James, spans over 160 acres. According to court records and listing materials reviewed by the journal, Epstein purchased the island in 2016 for close to $20m. It remains largely untouched and contains just a small collection of structures and Christmas Cove, a marine preserve. Little St James, which Epstein purchased in 1998, spans over 70 acres and in addition to a main residential compound and four guest villas, the island includes a helipad, a private dock, two pools, three private beaches, a gym and a tiki hut. In 2020, US Virgin Island officials, including the attorney general, alleged that Epstein lured women and girls – some as young as 11 – to Little St James where he “trafficked, raped, sexually assaulted and held captive” his victims, according to court documents. Proceeds from the islands’ sale will go towards the estate’s resolution of outstanding lawsuits and costs of estate operations, Daniel Weiner, an attorney for the Epstein estate, told the Journal. Already, $121m of Epstein’s estate has been used to compensate the late financier’s victims through the Epstein victims’ compensation program, he added. According to Denise George, the attorney general, Epstein used a computerized database to track women and girls on the island. Over the years, Epstein courted and interacted with numerous rich and powerful figures including Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew. Throughout his activities, Ghislaine Maxwell, a British socialite and daughter of the late press baron Robert Maxwell, helped traffic women and girls for Epstein. In 2019, Epstein killed himself in a New York jail cell where he was being held without bail after his arrest on sex-trafficking charges. He was facing trial in Manhattan on federal crimes, having worked out a plea deal in Florida years earlier on charges of sex offenses. Last December, Maxwell was convicted in New York of sex-trafficking and related charges for procuring girls in conjunction with Epstein, her former boyfriend.",News/US news,Islands owned by Jeffrey Epstein put up for sale to boost victims’ fund,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/23/jeffrey-epstein-islands-for-sale-virgin-islands
3/24/2022,"The Syrian regime is bulldozing former rebel-held neighbourhoods in Damascus under the guise of mine clearance to make space for a “new Syria” of upmarket new building developments and pristine gardens. An investigation by the Guardian, Lighthouse Reports, Syrian Investigative Reporting for Accountability Journalism (Siraj) and Rozana Radio has analysed the almost wholesale demolition of Qaboun, a Damascus suburb, one of many neighbourhoods in the capital that is being cleared and redeveloped beyond recognition after former residents have either been displaced by fighting or become refugees abroad. Qaboun, a suburb of Damascus that for years resisted the Assad regime, had been emptied of people but was still standing when Syrian forces seized it in 2017. Since then videos and satellite imagery obtained by the Guardian and its investigation partners show Qaboun has paid a heavy price for resisting, with the Syrian military using highly destructive methods to wipe out the entire neighbourhood, justifying the levelling of residential homes as a de-mining exercise. Qaboun is one of several areas across Damascus and Syria that have been demolished after being identified for expropriation under the government’s postwar construction, which is hoping to encourage foreign investment in real estate. The proposed plans show a dramatically different vision for Qaboun to the working-class neighbourhood that existed before the war and whose residents have been unable to claim their land since the fighting stopped, even while western countries such as Denmark and the UK tell asylum seekers that it is safe to return to Damascus. A satellite view of destruction in the Qaboun neighbourhood of Damascus, 18 February 2022. Image: Maxar Technologies /DigitalGlobe/Getty Images Former residents and researchers have accused President Bashar al-Assad’s regime of socially re-engineering the area after it became a rebel stronghold during the war. “It’s a kind of revenge on the people of Qaboun and to make sure there is nothing to return to,” says Mazeena Saidi, a former Qaboun resident now living in Denmark. “I think it is a message from the regime for the people of Qaboun. There is nothing for you here.” Saidi’s eldest son was tortured during the early protests in Qaboun and by the time the whole family left in 2012, there was intense fighting between regime forces and armed groups opposing the military’s crackdown on civilian protests. Qaboun finally fell to the regime in May 2017 and the military expelled the last remaining residents, among them some of Saidi’s relatives, who took a photo of her house before they left, which was still standing when regime forces took control. Mazeena Saidi’s house, which was still standing when regime forces took control of Qaboun in 2017. Photograph courtesy of a relative In September 2017, satellite imagery showed her home and the surrounding vicinity was demolished. In the past four years, the Syrian military has announced nearly 1,000 demolitions across Syria on its Twitter account, stretching from Daraa in the south to Aleppo in the north, routinely justifying them as the “removal of explosive devices left behind by the terrorist groups”. Satellite imagery and videos show far more demolitions were carried out. The Russian military, which describes its training of Syrian military engineers as a humanitarian mission, is assisting Syrians on the ground with de-mining operations in several neighbourhoods of Damascus, according to Russian state media. Analysis of hundreds of images, videos and social media posts from Qaboun reveal a pattern of large explosions that completely collapse buildings and much of their surroundings, which do not fit with the stated humanitarian aims. “Humanitarian mine action has completely different systems, purpose and outcome,” says Per Håkon Breivik, head of de-mining at Norwegian People’s Aid. He said the methods used by the Syrian forces could cause any undetonated explosives to gather under the rubble, which would be difficult to remove “There are no shortcuts to humanitarian de-mining. You must deal with each item one by one. You must explode down to the surface until you reach the concrete,” he says. “If you just demolish the building, it doesn’t mean that all the explosives will detonate. This [style] is typical of military demolitions. But these are residential areas, so it shouldn’t be in the military’s mandate.” One of the buildings demolished was an unfinished military housing project known as the Awqaf building, in late 2018. A video posted online shows members of the military watching the massive cloud of smoke that engulfed everything around the building. Satellite imagery shows that in the following weeks everything in a 500-metre radius of the building was demolished, including a school. It will be replaced with investment properties, according to an official blueprint seen by the Guardian and its investigation partners. Sara Kayyali, senior Syria researcher at Human Rights Watch, says the demolitions are potentially war crimes because there was no active hostility or military objective in the area after it was retaken. Throughout the war, Syria has introduced legislation that has allowed the regime to expropriate land and build on it with foreign investment, often stripping residents of their land because of conditions placed on them to claim ownership – such as having to return to Syria to make their claim in person. Qaboun’s demolition has taken place under one such law passed in 2015, allowing authorities to redraw boundaries in times of war and other disasters and claim the land of informal housing settlements. Qaboun before the war, when it was a busy working-class suburb of Damascus (top) and during the conflict (bottom). Photographs: Qaboun Media Centre and Odai Awdeh Historically, Qaboun’s residents lived in largely informal settlements working in shopkeeping, small businesses and manual labour. The Assad regime’s vision for Qaboun is a more upmarket neighbourhood of high-rises and carefully curated green spaces close to the city centre but also connected to other cities by the M5 motorway. The plans for Qaboun are part of the regime’s wider vision for Damascus – of a commercial capital with new urban developments built on former informal settlements, industrial zones and farmland. The flagship project has been Marota City, a neighbourhood of gleaming high-rises and pristine gardens planned in Basateen al-Razi, an informal settlement that had been an opposition hub. Researcher Joseph Daher says the Syrian regime has used the war to push through existing plans to restructure Damascus, bring in capital from investors and reward its own network. “War is used to deepen neoliberal policies and austerity measures, as well as to realise schemes it would not be able to do in a period that wasn’t a war or a crisis,” says Daher. “They’re using the war to put forward this kind of project that had a lot of opposition before 2011.” The damaged dome of Abu Bakr al-Sadeeq mosque, which was a rallying point during anti-regime protests and is one of a few buildings still standing. Photograph: Odai Awdeh Daher says that, despite the plans made by the government and the demolitions it has already carried out, there has been little actual construction because of a lack of funds and the ongoing insecurity. “The regime is completely lying when it’s saying that it wants the return of refugees. This is not the case. It doesn’t want them and it doesn’t have the capacities or the financial infrastructure to take care of them.” Eleven years since the war began, most of the 6.6 million refugees live in uncertainty in neighbouring countries with no prospect for a safe return. Another 6.7 million are internally displaced within Syria in poor conditions and dependent on humanitarian aid. Both Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have documented torture of Syrians returning from Jordan and Lebanon, confirming the fears of the majority of those in exile who, like Saidi, are reluctant to return. A Human Rights Watch report in October said returnees had also been subjected to extrajudicial killings and kidnappings, while most struggled with their basic needs in the aftermath of the war. The Syrian and Russian governments did not respond to requests for comment. For Saidi, there is no way home now that her neighbourhood has been demolished. In Denmark, the government has started revoking the residency permits of Syrian refugees, arguing that Damascus is safe for people to return. Saidi’s residency permit was renewed at the end of 2020, but her situation is precarious. The family must renew their status every two years. “We were already tired, we just wanted some stability. As soon as we got a little of it here in Denmark, they started to say Damascus is safe,” says Saidi, who told the Danish authorities that there was nothing for her to return to. “We are scared. It’s impossible for me to go back. My whole family is arrested, disappeared or killed by the regime. It is a regime of killers.”  Additional reporting by Charlotte Alfred, Ahmed Obaid and Ahmad Haj Hamdo.

3/24/2022,"Machu Picchu is one of the world’s best-known archaeological sites, a wonder of pre-Columbian architecture that has been closely studied for decades and a tourist attraction that draws hundreds of thousands of visitors every year. But a new academic paper argues that since its rediscovery more than a century ago, the site has been known by the wrong name. A Peruvian historian and a leading US archaeologist argue that the Unesco world heritage site was known by its Inca inhabitants as Huayna Picchu – the name of a peak overlooking the ruins – or simply Picchu. In their paper, published by Ñawpa Pacha: Journal of Andean Archaeology, Donato Amado Gonzales of Peru’s ministry of culture and Brian S Bauer from the University of Illinois Chicago say they scoured placenames on 19th-century maps, information in 17th-century documents and the original field notes of the US explorer Hiram Bingham – the modern-day discoverer of the Inca citadel – and found that not one of the sources refers to the site as Machu Picchu. Believed to have been once the summer retreat of the Inca emperor Pachacutec, Machu Picchu was memorably “discovered” by Bingham in 1911, although there is widespread academic consensus that the lost city was never really lost. But Gonzales and Bauer say their findings suggest that at the time of their rediscovery, the ruins were little known, even among those who lived in Peru’s Cusco region. “We began with the uncertainty of the name of the ruins when Bingham first visited them and then reviewed several maps and atlases printed before Bingham’s visit to the ruins,” said Bauer. “There is significant data which suggest that the Inca city actually was called Picchu or more likely, Huayna Picchu.” The researchers found that the ruins of an Inca town called Huayna Picchu are mentioned in a 1904 atlas that was published seven years before Bingham arrived in Peru. Moreover, the investigators say that Bingham was told in 1911 of ruins called Huayna Picchu along the Urubamba River before he left Cusco to search for the site. A landowner’s son later told Bingham in 1912 that the ruins were called Huayna Picchu, they add. The most definitive connections to the original name of the Inca city are preserved within accounts written by Spanish conquerors soon after they seized Cusco in the late 16th century, according to Bauer. “We end with a stunning, late 16th-century account when the indigenous people of the region were considering returning to reoccupy the site, which they called Huayna Picchu,” he said. The peak now known as Huayna Picchu remains part of the archaeological site and visitors can hike to the summit to get the most breathtaking view of the mountaintop ruin. While study is likely to prompt fresh debate, few historians seem to believe a name change is on the cards for the site. “All names are invented and changeable and it doesn’t make much difference,” said Natalia Sobrevilla, professor of Latin American history at the University of Kent. “Except now Machu Picchu is an established brand very linked to Peruvian identity, so what would be the point of changing it?” The Peruvian historian added: “As Shakespeare said: ‘A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.’”",News/Science,Machu Picchu: Inca site ‘has gone by wrong name for over 100 years’,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/mar/23/machu-picchu-inca-site-wrong-name
3/24/2022,"Nestlé has bowed to pressure and stopped the local production and sales of non-essential goods such as KitKats and Nesquik in Russia. The food and drinks group announced this week that it had stopped the import and export of non-essential goods but said on Wednesday that it was also stopping the vast majority of its local production of such items including coffee, confectionery and pet food. Only production of a limited number of essential items, such as baby food, food for hospital use and some basic pet food will now continue. The move comes after Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called out Nestlé and several other companies for staying in Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. He accused the KitKat maker of not living up to its “Good Food, Good Life” slogan, building on a wave of online criticism from shoppers, activists, investors and political figures. The brands Nestlé is now suspending make up the “vast majority of [prewar] volume and sales” in Russia, which amounted to 1.7bn Swiss francs (£1.4bn) in 2021, according to the company. “As the war continues in Ukraine, our activities in Russia will focus on providing essential food, such as infant food and medical/hospital nutrition – not on making a profit,” the company said in a statement. “We do not expect to make a profit in the country or pay any related taxes for the foreseeable future in Russia. If any profit is made, it will be donated in its entirety to humanitarian relief organisations.” A spokesperson for Nestlé said that it would continue to pay its Russian workers, adding: “We are in the process of identifying solutions for our people and our factories in Russia.” The company is meanwhile continuing to operate in Ukraine. A spokesperson said Nestlé was still able to deliver 60% of its prewar volumes in the country but had halted operations at its Kharkiv noodle factory owing to heavy shelling in the area. Most western brands have now ceased imports to Russia, while goods made in the country have been pulled from the shelves in British, US and European supermarkets. Some prominent US and UK retail brands have said they are still operating in Russia because they have been unable to force independent franchise operators to close down. Burger King’s owner, Restaurant Brands International, said last week fast food restaurants were still operating with its brand because its former Russian partner had refused to shut down.

3/24/2022,"The alleged killer of David Amess had a look of “self-satisfaction” and “smugness” as he was led away by police after assassinating the veteran Conservative MP, a court has heard. Julie Cushion, an aide to the MP, told of her horror as Amess was attacked as he held a constituency surgery in a church in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex. Ali Harbi Ali, 26, denies murdering Amess, 69, on 5 October 2021. He also denies preparing terrorist acts by scouting and researching other MPs to kill, including the housing minister, Michael Gove. Cushion, speaking from behind a screen, told the Old Bailey there was no security in place as Amess held his surgery in Belfairs methodist church, in his Southend West constituency. She said there would have been some security available if the surgery had been held in Amess’s constituency office. However, the MP had wanted to get closer to the community as pandemic restrictions eased and so held the advice surgery in different locations, which were advertised on social media. She said Amess had taken a selfie as the surgery was about the begin and posted it on Twitter. Cushion was Amess’s constituency secretary and greeted people as they arrived. The court heard earlier that Ali had posed as a constituent and said he wanted to see Amess as he had moved to the area and wished to discuss healthcare and local churches. Ali had a midday appointment and was greeted by Cushion on his arrival. He said he wanted to use the toilet and Cushion showed him where it was. Ali went in to the church vestry office where Amess was meeting constituents, with Cushion staying outside. Another aide, Rebecca Hayton, was in the room with Ali and Amess, taking notes. She said that after a few minutes, Ali talked about foreign affairs, despite the session being about constituency matters. His phone made a sound and Ali said “sorry”, which Hayton thought was an apology for the phone ringing. Ali then stood up, which she thought was so he could take a phone call. Instead, Hayton said, a scene of horror unfolded: “He [Ali] leans over and stabs him straight in the stomach. David screamed, and sort of panicked. I think he stabbed him again.” Hayton added: “I saw it [the knife] go in once and as I got up he [Ali] kept going.” Cushion, who had remained outside, told the jury she heard “a very piercing scream” and a loud crash, and thought it was furniture falling over. Hayton came running out “screaming that David had been stabbed and he was on the floor”, Cushion said. She said she froze, with her colleague screaming at her to call 999. Cushion said she later saw Ali being led out by police. Asked how he appeared, she said: “The image will stay with me for the rest of my life”. She told the jury Ali had a look of “self-satisfaction” and “smugness”. Amess had received 21 stab wounds and was declared dead about an hour later. Cushion said she and Amess had been close friends after he became the MP for Southend West. Ali had travelled to Leigh-on-Sea on the morning of the attack from his home in Kentish town, north London. The prosecution says Ali was a fanatical Islamist terrorist influenced by Islamic State propaganda, who had bought the knife used to stab Amess five years previously and had been researching an attack since 2019.
