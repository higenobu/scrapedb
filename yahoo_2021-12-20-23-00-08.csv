12/20/2021,"By Susan Heavey WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Monday vowed to vote on President Joe Biden's Build Back Better plan early next year despite opposition from a key Democratic senator that drew White House rebuke, and to bring forward voting rights legislation. ""The Senate will, in fact, consider the Build Back Better Act, very early in the new year so that every Member of this body has the opportunity to make their position known on the Senate floor, not just on television,"" Schumer wrote in a letter to colleagues. On Sunday, moderate Democrat Senator Joe Manchin dealt a potentially fatal blow to Biden's $1.75 trillion domestic investment bill, telling Fox News he would not vote for the measure. U.S. stock futures and European stocks fell on Monday following the legislative blow, along with COVID-19 fears over the Omicron variant, while Goldman Sachs trimmed its quarterly GDP forecasts for 2022 on the assumption that the plan would not become law. The Build Back Better plan codifies many of Biden's signature domestic policies, aiming to expand the social safety net and tackle climate change. Many Democrats have said the bill is essential to the party's chances in next year's midterm elections. A vote would force Manchin to publicly record his objection to the bill ahead of the elections, in which Democrats seek to keep control of the Senate as well as the House of Representatives. Manchin's comments prompted an angry response from the White House after months of negotiations. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki on Sunday said the Biden administration would find a way to move forward with the legislation in 2022. Still, it was not immediately clear how or if lawmakers could salvage the full bill without Manchin's vote in a 50-50 divided chamber that needs every Democrat on board, or whether parts of it could be adopted. ""We are going to vote on a revised version of the House-passed Build Back Better Act – and we will keep voting on it until we get something done,"" Schumer wrote. VOTING RIGHTS Schumer also said Congress' upper chamber would consider voting rights legislation soon after returning from its holiday recess in January and would look at changing procedural rules if Republicans ""continue to abuse the filibuster"" to block the bill. ""If the right to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy, then how can we in good conscience allow for a situation in which the Republican Party can debate and pass voter suppression laws at the state level with only a simple majority vote, but not allow the United States Senate to do the same?"" he wrote. Manchin, who won re-election in a deeply conservative state that voted for former President Donald Trump in 2020, has also balked at eliminating the filibuster to take up the voting rights legislation as has fellow moderate Democrat Kyrsten Sinema. Progressive Democrats blasted Manchin following his Sunday comments and have for months urged action on Biden's campaign promises, including voting rights. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Monday called Manchin's reversal ""an egregious breach"" of Biden's trust, telling MSNBC that Democratic leaders must move quickly to deliver for constituents and urging the Senate to reconvene early for the critical votes. ""We really need to start creating an environment of pressure,"" she said. ""Make it tough."" Elements of the social policy plan – such as universal preschool, an enhanced child-care tax credit and larger healthcare subsidies – are popular with voters, polling shows.

12/20/2021,"On Halloween 2018, a real-life nightmare played out on Elm Street in Springfield. Torie Parrow, 32, stopped by her house in the 1900 block of West Elm Street to pick up her son's costume. She left the boy in the car as she ran inside to grab his jester outfit. Inside waiting, however, was Parrow's husband, Melvin — who was out on bond after assaulting her a week prior. He had removed his ankle monitor. Melvin Parrow fatally shot Torie Parrow before taking his own life. Torie Parrow's 8-year-old son was left sitting in the car outside. His 911 call later alerted law enforcement to the deaths. Now, that boy — through his father — is suing the bail bond companies tasked with monitoring Melvin Parrow for failing to protect his mother. The lawsuit, which was filed in October in Greene County, claims that A-Advanced Bail Bonds, Michael Nivens Bail Bonds, First Track GPS and their owners were negligent and that Torie Parrow died as a ""direct and proximate result"" of their actions. According to the lawsuit, Torie Parrow and/or her family members reached out to Michael Nivens Bail Bonds after the company posted Melvin Parrow's $50,000 bond in late October 2018 to let them know Torie Parrow was terrified of her husband, but the bond company did not take extra precautions. Furthermore, the lawsuit alleges the defendants did not notify law enforcement when Melvin Parrow tampered with or removed his GPS monitor. More: Springfield’s high rates of gun violence, domestic abuse are linked, local leaders say Kent Hyde — a Springfield attorney who represents First Track GPS, A-Advanced Bail Bonds and the company owners — said his clients did inform the Greene County Prosecutor's Office when they became aware Melvin Parrow had tampered with his GPS monitoring device. Hyde said he was not sure if that notification happened before or after the murder-suicide. Hyde said despite the tragic outcome in this case, his clients performed the duties they were required to do. ""We believe the tracking company, First Track, did the job they were tasked with doing,"" Hyde said. Hyde has filed motions asking the claims be dismissed against his clients. The other defendants in this case do not have attorneys listed.

12/20/2021,"In a livestream last week, Ford quietly revealed the battery capacities available on its Ford F-150 Lightning electric pickup, Auto Evolution reported. To start with, the Standard Range model, with a projected 230 miles of range, will come with a 98 kWh battery pack. Meanwhile, the optional Extended Range version (300 miles targeted) will have a massive 131 kWh battery.  The Standard Range package will be the main offering on the first three of four versions: the fleet-oriented Lightning Pro, the XLT and the Lariat. The Extended Range is optional for the XLT and Lariat, and standard on the top-end Platinum model. Ford said that the ""F-150 Lighting Pro model will be available with the standard-range battery to retail customers,"" but it previously said that it would be available with the Extended Range option for fleet buyers.  Ford also revealed that the power fold mirrors would only be available on the Lariat and Platinum models, and that the Tough Bed spray-in bed liner is not standard, but an available option on all trims. Other options we already knew about include a high-powered 9.6 kW Pro Power system for the first two trims (it's standard on Lariat and Platinum) and 15.5-inch touchscreen with Sync 4A, available on the upper trim levels. Ford has yet to reveal exact retail prices, but it previously said that the Standard Range Lightning Pro will start at $39,974 before any tax incentives for commercial buyers, while the Extended Range model (again only for fleet buyers) will start at $49,974. Retail prices are expected to start at $42,000 and top out at $90,000 for the Platinum model. That's a fair bit higher than the $28,000 base price for an F-150 ICE version, but then again, most folks pay considerably more than that on average.  Given the large battery sizes, Ford's prices actually seem surprisingly reasonable. By comparison, Hyundai's Kona Electric has a much smaller 64 kWh battery and starts at $34,000. We should know the exact F-150 Lightning prices soon, as Ford said in the livestream that order banks would open in January 2022. Currently, it has 200,000 pre-orders in hand, and recently cut off further reservations. ",Business/Engadget,Ford’s Extended Range F-150 Lightning has a massive 131 kWh battery pack,https://news.yahoo.com/ford-f-150-lightning-ev-pickup-98-kwh-131-kwh-batteries-092329022.html
12/20/2021,"If you leave a job or retire, you’re often encouraged to roll over your 401(k) or other workplace retirement account into an individual retirement account. That might not be the right move. Workplace plans have rules that can protect you from subpar investments and advisors who put their own interests ahead of yours. IRA investments can be more expensive, which can result in less money to spend in retirement. Workplace plans also may offer easier access to your money. IRAs typically offer many more investment options, a fact heavily emphasized by the financial services companies that want your money. Rollovers are big business — the Investment Company Institute, a trade group, reports that households transferred $463 billion from employer-sponsored plans to IRAs in 2017, the latest year for which statistics are available. But just having more investment choices isn’t necessarily better. “With a 401(k), your options are typically going to be more limited, but your options are also going to be squarely within your best interest,” says Dylan Bruce, financial services counsel for the Consumer Federation of America, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. WHY THE FIDUCIARY STANDARD MATTERS You usually have choices about what to do with your retirement funds when you leave a job, and an IRA rollover is only one way to preserve the money’s tax-deferred status. Other ways include leaving the account where it is (your former employer must allow this if your balance is over $5,000 ) or rolling the money into a new employer’s retirement plan , if that plan accepts such transfers. Most workplace retirement plans are covered under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, which imposes a fiduciary duty on the people and companies overseeing the plans. Fiduciaries are required to operate solely in the interests of the participants and avoid conflicts of interest. In the past, advisors weren’t held to the same standard when recommending IRA rollovers, although that’s changing. The U.S. Department of Labor is extending fiduciary coverage to IRA rollovers , recognizing that financial services providers often have a strong economic incentive to recommend them even when they’re not in an investor’s best interest. Bruce calls that “a very good development,” but it won’t happen overnight. Enforcement of the new rules will be rolled out in stages starting next year, Bruce says. WORKPLACE PLANS MAY COST LESS, OFFER MORE IRAs are sometimes touted as being cheaper than 401(k)s on average, but often that’s not the case. Since 2000, the cost of equity funds inside 401(k)s has dropped substantially , according to the Investment Company Institute. The average expense ratio for stock mutual funds in the U.S. in 2020 was 1.16%, while 401(k) investors paid about one third that amount, or 0.39 %, on average. Expense ratios are the annual fees charged for operating and administering the funds. Fees make a big difference in how much your nest egg can grow. Let’s say you invest $20,000 in a fund with a 1.16% expense ratio that grows an average of 8% each year. After 40 years, you’d have about $282,000. With a 0.39% fee, your balance would be nearly $376,000, or one-third more. Accessing your money can be harder with an IRA, as well. You can’t borrow money from an IRA for longer than 60 days , or it’s considered a taxable distribution. Any money you withdraw before age 59 1/2 is typically penalized as well as taxed, although the penalty is waived for certain withdrawals, such as for higher education or a first-home purchase. With 401(k)s, by contrast, you can begin withdrawing money at age 55 without penalties if you no longer work for the company offering the plan. If you transfer an old 401(k) account to a new employer’s plan, you typically can borrow up to half of your total vested balance or $50,000, whichever is less, and pay the money back over five years. Furthermore, your 401(k) is also generally protected from creditors. Protection for IRAs varies based on state law. WHEN A ROLLOVER MAKES SENSE Many people don’t want to leave money behind at their previous employer, and a rollover is a much better option than cashing out. A rollover also could be prudent if you don’t have access to a low-cost 401(k), you want to consolidate multiple retirement accounts, your investment options are too limited or the advisor recommending the rollover is a fiduciary (and willing to put that in writing). It’s essential to investigate all your options, though, before deciding an IRA rollover is the right one. This is, after all, money you hope will sustain you for many years in retirement so it’s important to choose wisely. “It’s probably going to be for most folks one of the most important financial decisions of their lives,” Bruce says. _________________________________ This column was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.
