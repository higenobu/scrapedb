12/30/2021,"There is a more accurate term than insurrectionists to describe the people who stormed the US Capitol building on 6 January, forever smearing the seat of the American republic with fear and fascism. Although their activities inspired terror and were planned in part by members of white supremacist groups, they object to being labeled as “terrorists” or “white supremacists”. Calling them “rioters” doesn’t quite capture the political motivations of the pro-authoritarian mob of Maga fanatics. Perhaps we should view them as historical re-enactors. After all, they were only recreating the effort to undermine democracy, freedom and the US constitution that has repeated itself for centuries. Yet, if you asked them, they would undoubtedly say they were “patriots”.  Throughout the course of American history, whenever this country has found itself standing on the unthinkable precipice of ruin, there has always been a horde pledging their allegiance to the flag while clamoring to push the country into the abyss. To be clear, there is a difference between loving one’s country and the vainglorious virtue-signaling that defines America’s most self-righteously toxic misnomer. But fanaticism does not prove one’s devotion. Nationalism is not the same as patriotism. In his 1861 Cornerstone Speech describing the “revolution” that still stands as the bloodiest war in the history of this continent, Confederate States of America vice-president Alexander H Stephens crowed that he had never met “an abler, wiser, a more conservative, deliberate, determined, resolute, and patriotic body of men” than those who would rather rip their nation in half than discontinue their for-profit human trafficking enterprise. Five years later, the conquered confederacy of traitors would unite to form the Ku Klux Klan, an “institution of chivalry, humanity, mercy and patriotism … noble in sentiment, generous in manhood and patriotic in purpose.” Alabama governor George Wallace defended segregation as a matter of patriotism. When South Carolina senator Strom Thurmond filibustered the Civil Rights Act of 1957, he wondered why the people of the north would pick on the “patriotic” people who simply wanted to preserve white supremacy. After he switched parties in protest of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, he was embraced by the new “lilywhite” Republicans as a “patriot”. The Tea Party patriots tossed racial slurs at John Lewis, while at least two people have been killed at rallies organized by the far-right group Patriot Prayer. There is nothing more unpatriotic than someone who calls themself a “patriot”. The flag-waving hypocrites who proudly proclaim their loyalty to their country are determined to kill America. Since the 2020 election, at least 19 states have passed 33 laws that make it harder to vote. These legislative acts of voter suppression are largely introduced and passed by adherents to Donald Trump’s “Stop the Steal” movement that now includes a considerable share of the GOP’s constituency. Although these “America first” acolytes claim to want to make their country great again, their real end game is to destroy any semblance of a government where white people’s voting power is equal to their share of the electorate. In other words, the principal goal of the so-called Patriot Party is the opposite of democracy. These America-mongers perform patriotism while disregarding the actual values of their country. They will proudly recite the pledge of allegiance while demonizing Black Lives Matter protesters, reform-seekers or any movement that promotes liberty and justice for all. In Arizona, armed members of the Montezuma County Patriots were charged with harassing participants in a Walk for Justice and Peace. The trial begins days after the white supremacist group Patriot Front organized a rally in Washington. At least three deaths are associated with Patriot Prayer, another pro-Trump gang that staged violent demonstrations across the country. They have constructed a parody of a pro-life movement that does everything it can to strip rights and life away from their fellow Americans. Archbishop Timothy P Broglio, head of the US Archdiocese for the Military Services, claimed that forcing women to carry out unwanted pregnancies is an “authentic act of patriotism”. A true lover of democracy would accept stricter gun laws favored by most Americans. Instead, these performance artists made the National Rifle Association the official partner of school shootings by casting their uncompromising support for firearm manufacturers as an act of patriotism. They claim critical race theory makes kids feel bad and hate America. Yet, they are somehow willing to trade the lives of social studies students for gun industry profits. Whether it’s back-alley abortions or the spilled blood of second-graders, patriots have never cared about life, liberty or the pursuit of happiness. Besides being unapologetically pro-death, they are unrepentant liars. They spread conspiracy theories and reject the scientific research of climatologists, immunologists and criminologists, ignoring the death and destruction caused by climate change, Covid-19 and the criminal justice system. They push the false notions of illegal immigration, crime and widespread voter fraud, fully knowing the consequences of their fearmongering. Their obstruction of the 6 January House committee proves it. Their text messages prove it. Their own recounts prove it. Math, history, science, and the entire English language prove that they have no use for truth, facts or evidence. This historically inaccurate, mathematically incorrect caricature of patriotism is white nationalism wrapped in a star-spangled banner. If the American empire ever falls – and it will – we can thank the patriots for the demise of democracy. Ultimately, these fanatical jingoists are the least patriotic people in America. They detest democracy and loathe any prospect of a more perfect union. They have pledged their allegiance to the flag, but not the republic for which it stands. Patriotism as performance is their only protection because a country that provides liberty and justice for all is too unbearable a thought. They’d rather kill it first.

12/30/2021,"The killing of Valentina Orellana-Peralta, a 14-year-old who died in her mother’s arms after police shot her in a department store dressing room, has sparked outrage and renewed scrutiny of the Los Angeles police department. Yet her death was just one of five killings by LAPD in a nine-day period this month, marking a brutal end to a year that has seen repeated scandals inside one of America’s largest police departments.  This year, the LAPD killed more than double the number of civilians than in 2020. And while it’s unclear what’s driving the increase, activists argue that LAPD officers have been emboldened to use lethal force in careless and unwarranted ways after seeing their colleagues face little, if any, repercussions. “The tactic is shooting first and asking questions later,” said Jose Barrera, California director for the League of United Latin American Citizens. During the past week and a half, LAPD shot six people, including Orellana-Peralta. Five of the people shot by LAPD around the Christmas holiday have died, and none were armed with guns, according to official accounts. The killings added to an already grim year for the LAPD’s use of lethal force. In 2021, LAPD has shot 38 people, killing 18 of them, according to the LA Times. In 2020, the department shot 27 people, killing seven of them. Those figures were similar to 2019, when LAPD shot 26 people, killing twelve. “There’s just a reckless disregard for human life,” said Christian Contreras, a local civil rights attorney representing the family of one of the civilians killed by the department this month. “We’re dealing with a huge surge in police shootings and killings of Black and brown people. It’s out of control.” The shootings, and particularly the death of the teenage bystander, have brought national attention on the department, which has faced continued accusations of unjustified killings, racial profiling and civil rights violations. In most instances, police have released few details about the people they killed and why police resorted to deadly force. But even with the limited information available, critics say the circumstances do not indicate deadly force was merited. On 18 December, LAPD officers fatally shot two people in separate incidents – both involving men allegedly holding knives. In the first incident, LAPD said officers in the Newton division in South Central were responding to a call for a “domestic violence suspect” at an apartment complex, described as a “man in his 30s”. A spokesperson said that officers upon arrival found Rosendo Olivio Jr, 34, who “fit that description”. Police alleged Olivio was holding a “folding knife” and butane lighter and yelling profanities and threats, and that an officer shot him dead when he “ignored commands”. But Contreras, an attorney representing Olivio’s family, said it was unclear if Olivio was the suspect related to the original call, and that his family has questioned whether he was involved. Holding a pocket knife was not justification for killing him, Contreras added. Olivio’s shocked family struggled to process the news and the LAPD statements presenting their loved one as a violent criminal, the attorney said. Olivio was a father of four, who lived in a neighborhood where police have been embroiled in repeated scandals over the killing of civilians. (Officers in the LAPD’s Newton division have for years used the nickname, “Shootin’ Newton”.) And although the LA police commission ruled that police officers violated policy in two other recent LAPD killings in south LA, the officers have not faced charges. “Police investigate themselves … and justify the conduct of their colleagues,” said Contreras. “The system is designed to cover up misconduct.” In the second 18 December killing, LAPD also alleged that a man with a knife ignored commands, but the department’s statement made no mention of whether he had threatened anyone. On 23 December, LAPD killed two people inside a Burlington Coat Factory store in North Hollywood: a 24-year-old man who had a bike lock and had assaulted several customers, and Orellana-Peralta, the 14-year-old who was in a dressing room. Video of the shooting showed an officer immediately firing at the man from a distance, without appearing to issue any commands. One of the officer’s bullets hit the girl, who was shopping for Christmas dresses. Civil rights advocates questioned why an officer with an assault rifle appeared to fire at 24-year-old Daniel Elena Lopez, who did not have a gun, without attempting to deescalate and without assessing whether bystanders could be endangered. Valentina’s mother, Soledad Peralta, said the shot knocked them both to the ground and that police ignored her cries for help. Once LAPD located them in the dressing room, officers removed her from her daughter, and “just left her laying there alone”, she said. LAPD declined to comment on her claims. Then on Christmas Eve, LAPD shot a man who was allegedly shooting a gun in the air; he survived, but was in critical condition. And on 26 December, an officer fatally shot a man who was at a gas station and allegedly had a knife. LAPD did not respond to the Guardian’s inquiries about the rise in killings. Advocates argued that the surge in killings was part of a pattern of misconduct this year that required systemic change. Other controversies involving the LAPD in 2021 included: officers detonating seized fireworks in south LA, destroying part of a neighborhood and 22 residential properties; officers allegedly purchasing stolen guns; officers accused of falsely labeling civilians as gang members; officers not wearing masks in violation of Covid policies, but facing no discipline; the department promoting inaccurate data about its traffic stops; and revelations about the agency’s use of surveillance technology, prompting a rebuke from Facebook. Officials have touted a range of LAPD reforms during the pandemic, including initiatives sending mental health professionals to respond to certain calls, expanded deescalation training and community programs meant to build relationships and restore trust. But the steady stream of scandals, activists said, illustrated how the department fails to prioritize public safety and how reforms have not prevented harmful practices. “LAPD is the one that creates the danger,” said Albert Corado, whose sister Mely was killed by LAPD in 2018 in a shooting with similarities to the Burlington case. She was working as a manager at a Trader Joe’s store when an officer fired at a suspect and killed her in the process. The death of his sister could have been a turning point for LAPD, he said. But instead, the cycle of killings and unanswered calls for justice has continued, even after the reckoning prompted by George Floyd’s death. “We’ve been at this moment many times in LA and across the country. Every few months, we say we’re so sorry for this person, and LAPD needs to be reigned in, and it doesn’t happen,” said Corado. “After Mely’s death, they didn’t change a damn thing. All these people are dead, and we’ve yet to do anything really substantial in a way that is going to be meaningful for victims.” Corado is running for city council and advocates for the defunding of LAPD and the abolishing of police. Supporters of defunding argue that the best way to reduce police violence is to cut LAPD’s budget, limit their interactions with the community, and reinvest the funds in services. He said he was tired of conservatives who defend police at all costs, as well as Democrats who continue to increase law enforcement budgets while pushing modest reforms that have failed to stop the killings. LAPD and its supporters have recently been pushing for more resources, citing concerns about rising crime, including high-profile robbery cases and retail thefts. The data, however, paints a more complicated picture; homicides have increased, reflecting national trends during the pandemic, but property crime is generally down. Latora Green, an advocate who attended the press conference of Orellana-Peralta’s parents on Tuesday, said she hoped more people would come together to push for defunding: “It’s the whole system that needs to be dismantled.” No amount of accountability can bring back the 14-year-old victim, she added: “What really is justice when you lose someone?” Corado also came to the news conference to offer support to the grieving parents. He said he wanted them to know they were not alone – that there was a network of families across LA who have suffered similar tragedies.",News/US news,Five LAPD killings in nine days: teen’s death caps brutal year of police shootings,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/30/los-angeles-police-department-killings-lapd-valentina-orellana-peralta
12/30/2021,"Elon Musk has rejected criticisms that his company is taking up too much room in space, saying his tens of thousands of planned satellites would be able to coexist with many others. As well as building up Tesla into the world’s most valuable carmaker by pioneering electric cars, Musk has shaken up the space industry by founding SpaceX, a private rocket company that is also seeking to become a major telecommunications entity through a network of tens of thousands of low-orbiting “Starlink” satellites.  SpaceX has already launched more than 1,600 satellites, including a recent launch on 18 December which added a further 52, making it the focus of calls for regulation of space. Musk dismissed criticisms that SpaceX was dominating radio frequencies and orbital slots, in an interview published by the Financial Times. “Space is just extremely enormous, and satellites are very tiny,” Musk said. “This is not some situation where we’re effectively blocking others in any way. We’ve not blocked anyone from doing anything, nor do we expect to.” Josef Aschbacher, head of the European Space Agency, said earlier this month that Musk was “making the rules” in space. Aschbacher called for coordinated action from the EU and other countries to ensure that SpaceX’s constellation did not prevent other countries or companies from launching their own satellites. Musk compared the number of satellites with the 2bn vehicles on the Earth’s surface, suggesting there was room for “tens of billions” of satellites. The FT cited an astrophysicist disputing that claim on the grounds that satellites need large gaps to be able to safely avoid collisions. SpaceX has also drawn criticism from China, which this week publicly accused the US of ignoring international treaty obligations following two near misses between the Chinese space station and Starlink satellites. China said the space station had been forced to manoeuvre to avoid satellites in July and October. Astronomers have also expressed increasing concern that the proliferation of tens of thousands of satellites will cause unalterable changes to the night sky if launches remain unregulated. Manufacturers have already tried to address such criticisms with design changes to make satellites less visible from Earth. SpaceX, which Musk founded in 2002, is racing against competitors including the UK government-backed OneWeb to build a satellite network big enough to cover the whole globe. SpaceX has permission from US authorities to launch 12,000 satellites and eventually plans to have a constellation of 42,000 – many times more than the 8,000 or so in orbit in September. Amazon, founded by Jeff Bezos, the world’s second-richest person after Musk, is also planning to join the low-Earth-orbit (LEO) space race with the first launch of its Project Kuiper satellites in late 2022. Other competitors include Blackrock-backed Astranis, US weapons manufacturer Lockheed Martin, Canada’s Telesat and the Chinese government.",News/Technology,Elon Musk rejects mounting criticism his satellites are clogging space,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/dec/30/elon-musk-rejects-mounting-criticism-his-satellites-are-clogging-space
12/30/2021,"The outgoing head of the Bar Council has labelled Dominic Raab “thin-skinned” for failing to meet him, claiming he was snubbed by the justice secretary for defending lawyers. Derek Sweeting QC, whose tenure as chair of the professional body representing more than 16,000 barristers in England and Wales concludes at the end of the year, said he has not had a face-to-face meeting with Raab since the latter was appointed lord chancellor in mid-September.  In an interview with the Guardian, Sweeting said: “I still haven’t met him and don’t expect to. I understand he took exception to something which I had said and I have a good idea what it was. “All I would say is that if ministers are going to make attacks on lawyers – unfairly, in my view, and the view of many others – then they should expect a robust response. We shouldn’t then end up in a position where we are denied meetings as a result of being critical. It does seem counterproductive and perhaps a bit of a thin-skinned approach.” Raab is understood to have taken exception to comments Sweeting made expressing concern about the lord chancellor’s remarks in parliament when he said there was a “widespread practice” among defence lawyers “of encouraging the accused to wait until the moment in court before they take the decision on whether to plead guilty”. Many criminal lawyers took umbrage at Raab’s words, suggesting they were misleading and added to the government’s anti-lawyer rhetoric. Raab also attracted the ire of many barristers for not attending the Bar Council’s first physical conference in two years at the beginning of the month and sending a recorded message instead. To add insult to injury, on the day of the conference, he posted a picture on Twitter of himself with two people on roller skates dressed as Christmas puddings at a festival in his constituency. Great to open the Christmas festival in Walton today - wonderful to see the community out enjoying the festive fun, including the roller-skating Christmas pudding! pic.twitter.com/xsBPxs2KZw “It got a pretty poor reception,” said Sweeting. “I do understand that an MP with a marginal seat would want to be in his constituency on a Saturday, and it wouldn’t have been a problem if he had responded to requests for a meeting in the months since he became lord chancellor.” Raab’s failure to meet Sweeting comes at a time when the backlog in the crown courts, which try the most serious offences, stands at approximately 60,000 cases, with some trials pushed back until 2023. There have also been major bills published on judicial review and crime and sentencing. The Guardian understands that the justice secretary has met Stephanie Boyce, the president of the Law Society, which is the equivalent professional body for solicitors. Sweeting said: “It is important to talk to politicians face to face, not all the time, because they have lots of other priorities, but it’s really interesting what comes out of those sorts of discussions, not just on my part, but on the part of politicians who often say, ‘Oh, I actually would like to talk about this more than that.’ You often find the next conversation is the one in which you really get down to business and talk about the things that you’ve identified as mutual areas of interest, which is why I think it’s disappointing I haven’t had a face-to-face meeting.” Discussing an eventful year as chair, Sweeting also pointedly contrasted his personal response to the crisis in Afghanistan with that of Raab, who was criticised for remaining on a family holiday in Crete while the Afghan government collapsed. “We [the Bar Council] did a lot of work on Afghanistan during the summer,” said Sweeting. “I interrupted my holidays to do some work on it as well because it was urgent.” Sweeting, who will take up an appointment as a high court judge on 11 January, urged Raab to reconsider. “I hope that there’ll be a rethink and engagement as soon as possible with my successor,” he said. “I and the Bar Council have had very constructive relationships this year with officials at the MoJ [Ministry of Justice], as well as politicians – this is something of an exception to my experience of the year.” A MoJ spokesperson said: “The justice secretary has engaged regularly with the legal sector and will continue to do so.”",News/Politics,Bar Council chair criticises ‘thin-skinned’ Raab for not meeting him,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/30/bar-council-chair-criticises-dominic-raab-meeting
