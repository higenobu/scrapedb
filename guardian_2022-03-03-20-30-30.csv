3/3/2022,"War is never just a matter of soldiers and weapons. Indeed, economic warfare has been a central overt aspect of war, especially obvious since the beginning of the 20th century. It still is today, but we call it “sanctions”. But sanctions are a form of war, not an alternative to it, and like war, dangerous, damaging and unpredictable in impact. On Sunday night and Monday morning, the US and Europe imposed the most crippling and severe sanctions ever levelled against a G20 country. Russia has been treated like Iran, North Korea, Venezuela. Russian money, until recently so eagerly sought, so politically efficacious, not least in London, has been sterilised. The economic war that the EU and Nato members have launched against Russia is mainly financial, and technological, cutting off the Russia state from its overseas assets, which are now unusable, and preventing it from buying all sorts of critical equipment. The overseas operations of Russian financial institutions have been hobbled and Russian financial institutions expelled from the technical mechanisms of global capitalism. The consequences have been clear, a huge devaluation of the rouble, a doubling of rouble interest rates, potential runs on domestic banks, and the possibility of inflation. The Russian state has been financially disarmed, externally at least. The attack is not a total one, quite deliberately so. Russia can still sell its two main exports for hard cash, energy and grain, but that is a measure of the strength of the west. It does not want to deprive the world economy of supplies at a time of rising commodity prices. But who is in charge is completely clear, and what expectations are also. Foreign investors in Russia are pulling out as best they can, like BP and Shell, and cultural and sporting bodies are acting to ban Russia. Social media imposes controls, mendacious broadcasters banned. What this episode reveals if nothing else is that if we choose to do so the power of money can be silenced, markets can not only be bucked, but directly and powerfully manipulated. The great financial crisis and Covid both launched complex financial engineering measures to keep economies going, now they have been inverted to crash and control one from the outside, a trickier task. As James Meadway suggests, something like this has been threatened before, but doing it is a different matter. The state is back, and international coordination and cooperation too, with the two of the three great economic blocs in the world working in concert. The belief that international trade would be so good for all, that no sane person would ever start a war again was, in the words of Norman Angell, the Great Illusion. But there was always another much darker side to this coin. It was that if one cut a belligerent nation out of international trade the economic and social consequences would be so awful it would be forced to cease fighting. Economic warfare was indeed thought of as a weapon of mass destruction, as Nicholas Mulder’s brilliant and timely history tells us. This was especially true of the liberal internationalists of the interwar years, once lazily thought of as pacifists, who saw sanctions (and a bit of international airpower) not so much as alternatives to war, but rather particularly devastating forms of war whose threatened use would maintain a liberal world order. They had some justification for thinking this. The blockade of Germany and Austria-Hungary in the great war had itself killed hundreds of thousands. But the second world war demonstrated the limitations as well as the possibilities of economic warfare. The British launched economic war against Germany in 1939, driving German trade off the surface of much of the earth, and especially from 1940, preventing neutral trade with German-dominated Europe. They attacked Germany’s supply of iron ore from Sweden, leading to Germany’s invasion of Norway. Strategic bombing, thought of as an extension of blockade, was also launched in 1940. But Germany knew what was coming, and partly for that reason had made a deal with the USSR, and later invaded it. The imposition of oil sanctions on Japan in 1940 led to it attacking the US, British and Dutch empires in the east in December 1941. It took years of war and sanctions to crush the German and Japanese economies, even though the allied United Nations controlled all the rest of the world economy. After the war, cold war went with hot sanctions. The iron and bamboo curtains were heavily policed economic and technological barriers. And since the end of the cold war sanctions continued to be used, indeed extended. They have proved damaging, and indeed deadly to people, though not to regimes. Iran, Iraq, Cuba, Syria, Venezuela, North Korea, Afghanistan are or have been subject to sanctions, often for years. Russia too has been sanctioned since 2014. But sanctions have probably not been the worst causes of economic collapse. Russia, after 1989, lost perhaps half its GDP per capita, which did not return to Soviet levels until around 2005. This economic catastrophe created Putinism. Covid itself had an enormous impact on much of the world economy, but has changed little else. Sanctions are seen as alternative to war, more readily voted for. But they are aggressive actions, and are like wars in that they are costly affairs. Effective sanctions require serious economic and political intelligence, the capacity and willingness to act against evasions and to bear the cost they impose on the imposer. Sanctions are, like war, a matter of alliances. In the second world war, the United Nations dominated the world economy, to an extent that today’s Nato/EU cannot match. Interdicting the Spanish merchant marine during the second world war was a very different matter from bringing China into anti-Russia sanctions today. On the other hand today Russia has an economy smaller than Italy’s. How effective sanctions could be in crippling an economy like the Russian one remains to be seen. After all, it is much easier to affect financial instruments than the real economy, and trade is not everything for a country as geographically large as Russia. As was found during the second world war sanctions don’t simply take a chunk out of an economy, they force it to change, to emphasise self-sufficiency. Sanctions force states into internal transformation and repression. They also lead to counter sanctions, and to military threats. Thus Germany, a very much larger economy than Russia, is not only imposing sanctions, but preparing to diversify its energy supply, and to nearly double its defence budget, which would make it very much larger than Russia’s. Putin’s crime is thus not just a matter of attempting to take over Ukraine, but turning the world once more into one with surging military expenditure and warring political economic blocs. But we also need to look at the political logics that may play out. While there is a possibility that these events will boost the standing of western militarists, those who would have us continue to engage in permanent war, another possibility is there. For who are the enemies this time? They are neither communists nor Islamists nor Arab nationalists. They are white nationalists, producers of fossil fuels, kleptocrats, near climate denialists, critics of what they call gender ideology and practiced and fluent liars. It is not just Putin who should be scared, but all the mini-Putins he has inspired, in power in London, Brasília, Budapest, Warsaw and Riyadh, and recently in Washington. This has the potential not only of turning into a global campaign against fossil fuels and kleptocratic tax havens, but might arouse the wrath of the woke against the neofascist international of our time. But we must beware, for the liberal internationalist drive to sanctions and to war, usually illegal, has already blighted the lives of millions in the 21st century. We should remember that war itself is a crime, not merely the site of potential war crimes.

3/3/2022,"A collection of bronzes sculpted by Renaissance master Donatello has been moved for the first time from the Italian churches where he installed them 600 years ago so that they can be displayed at a ground-breaking exhibition in Florence Three of the four pieces, a relief, a statue and two bronze doors, from Siena Cathedral and San Lorenzo baptistery in Florence, are also being restored to their former glory using techniques ranging from chiselling with porcupine needles to thermographing to discover structural weaknesses. The delicate operation is taking place ahead of the first ever exhibition of all major works by Donatello (1386-1466), the Florentine-born sculptor who was reputedly the first genius of the Renaissance period. From 19 March 2022 until 31 July, the Fondazione Palazzo Strozzi and the Bargello in Florence, home to Donatello’s most famous marble, David, will jointly showcase around 130 sculptures, paintings and drawings with loans from over 50 of the world’s leading museums and institutions. They include the artist’s world-famous bronze relief of the Feast of Herod and two 50cm high statues, Virtue Hope and Virtue Faith, from the baptismal font in Siena Cathedral, along with the bronze doors of the Sagrestia Vecchia di San Lorenzo in Florence’s Basilica of San Lorenzo. None of those works have ever previously travelled from the original churches in which Donatello installed them in the 15th century. Francesco Caglioti, curator of the exhibition, Donatello, the Renaissance, said the task of disassembling and moving the pieces had been a challenge but gratifying as “exhibitions named after [Donatello] so far have mostly been done by exhibiting copies or limiting the choice of originals to a few pieces”. “These are extremely delicate operations because of the great historical, artistic, and cultural value of the works, but also because of the size of the works themselves,” a spokesman added. Born Donato di Niccolò di Betto Bardi in Florence, Italy, in 1386, Donatello, the son of a craftsman, mastered marble, stone, bronze, terracotta, wood, stucco, embossed copper, papier-mâché and glass paste and ceramics. His 60cm by 60cm gilded bronze panel of Banquet of Herod, one of the Florentine artist’s most significant works, shows multiple scenes of the presentation of John the Baptist’s head to King Herod on a golden platter by a kneeling soldier. Musicians are in the background, while Herod withdraws in horror while two children flee, one of them tripping as he turns to look at the grim scene. Following his success with this relief in 1427, Donatello became a favourite of the Medici family, who commissioned him to make bronze doors in the Basilica of San Lorenzo, completed between 1434 and 1442. Each door weighs 80kg. The Basilica is the burial place of all the principal members of the Medici family. The doors of the Sagrestia Vecchia, the statue Virtue Hope and the relief of Herod’s feast were transported to the Laboratories of the Opificio delle Pietre Dure in Florence for restoration before being transported to their place in the exhibition. Thermographs, or thermal imaging, was used to highlight structural weaknesses in the works. Over time the copper contained in the bronze alloy in the works had turned green, particularly in the central part of the two doors where people still push them open. The sculptures were dusted using soft-bristle brushes and washed with steamed demineralised water, organic solvents or bicarbonate solution. Probes, Plexiglas tools, porcupine needles and other tools made of soft wood were deployed for cleaning and finishing the minute engravings in the metal. A coat of microcrystalline wax was applied at the end to offer long-term protection. The Virtue Faith statue will be restored after the exhibition. A spokesman said moving the works to the exhibit had been undertaken with the greatest of care and the highest security. “The works have been placed in special crates prepared according to museum standards and managed closely to ensure the protection of the works,” he said. “The crates are equipped with a suitable locking system for the work. The transport is carried out with airconditioned vehicles equipped with adequate shock absorbers.” The Staatliche Museum in Berlin will host its own version of the exhibition from 2 September 2022 to 8 January 2023, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London will stage its exhibition in 2023. But the works from Siena Cathedral and Florence’s Basilica of San Lorenzo will not leave Italy.",Arts/Art and design,Donatello bronzes moved in Italy for groundbreaking exhibition,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/03/donatello-bronzes-moved-in-italy-for-groundbreaking-exhibition
3/3/2022,"Microplastics can be found everywhere, from waterways to fish to inside the human body’s soft tissues. And it’s only getting worse – 11m metric tons of plastic enter the planet’s oceans each year, an amount that is expected to triple by 2040. California is trying to get ahead of the problem, becoming the first US state to put in place a comprehensive plan for tackling microplastics. The roadmap of 22 actions is focused on preventing plastic particles from getting into the environment, intercepting plastics pollution and educating the public about the problem. Announcing the strategy last week, Wade Crowfoot, the state’s secretary of natural resources, underscored the urgency of the moment. “Microplastics are poisoning the ocean, both across the planet and off the California coast,” Crowfoot said in a statement. “We must take action.” But with a problem of this enormity, will the intervention turn the tide? Research has found that California’s waterways are already saturated with microplastics, including an estimated 7tn pieces in the San Francisco bay alone, much of which washes in through stormwater drains. According to the California Ocean Protection Council, the top sources of microplastics are tires, synthetic textiles, cigarette filters and single-use plastic food-ware. Some experts are hopeful. Andrew Gray, a watershed hydrologist at the University of California, Riverside, says that he thinks the new strategy is well aligned with the science as we know it now. Gray’s lab did some of the science that underlies the strategy. The strategy is heavily focused on preventing plastics from getting into the environment in the first place. It recommends banning certain product materials, prioritizing reusability, and limiting single-use plastic. Other such preventative mechanisms include statewide purchasing of reusable food-ware, as well as a prohibition on the sale and distribution of expanded polystyrene food-ware and packaging by 2023. Gray says this emphasis on prevention is critical, because cleaning up microplastics once they are in the environment is virtually impossible. “That’s where we are going to gain the most benefit at the end of the day.” California’s plan comes as the pandemic has increased demand for single-use plastic, intensifying pressure on the environment, according to research published last fall. More than 8m tons of pandemic-associated plastic waste have been generated globally, with more than 25,000 tons entering the global ocean – mostly medical waste from hospitals. In addition, some legislation aimed at curbing plastic pollution was postponed, both nationally and in California. But with life returning to a state of semi-normalcy, efforts appear to be getting back on track, Gray says. In November, California voters will have a chance to pass a ballot measure that would require all single-use plastic packaging, containers and utensils to be reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2030. The state’s plan also has a focus on education – but not the message of personal responsibility that some people would imagine, says Gray. There has been a push by plastic producers to make people take on the burden of making sure plastics don’t enter the environment, but the idea here is that producers bear more responsibility, and people should know why. “Education basically means: we want people to understand why microplastics are potentially a large problem and how we can take steps before it gets worse.” On the science side, the strategy focuses on monitoring how many microplastic particles are in different parts of the environment, which is critical because we need to understand what is in the environment and where it’s coming from, Gray says. Eventually, the goal is to develop microplastics budgets – allowable levels – for waterways and coastal oceans. The strategy will also retrofit stormwater infrastructure and stop companies from illegally discharging the tiny pellets that comprise the building blocks for most plastics. California’s plan potentially points the way forward for the global community which is ringing the alarm about the dire state of plastic waste. On Monday, world leaders gathered at the United Nations Environment Assembly in Nairobi to agree on a global treaty to address plastic pollution. “The total mass of plastics produced exceeds both the overall mass of all land and marine animals and the planetary boundary for these novel substances, moving us out of a safe operating space for humanity,” a group of scientists wrote in an op-ed for Environmental Health News. “Yet industry continues to project growth, investing billions of dollars in new infrastructure and opposing national and now international efforts to curb both plastic production and pollution.” When it comes to California’s place in the world of combatting microplastics, Gray says that the state is working hard to make science-based decisions, adding that both Europe and the US are still in the early days of understanding the flow of plastic particles through the environment. “California is on the right track in terms of pushing ahead and being at the forefront, and this is being driven by science.”",News/US news,California wants to eradicate microplastics.

We had an amazing evening, learning about the colourful lives and times of these literary greats. It included a memorable visit to Trinity College and a literary quiz. The following day’s visit to the James Joyce Cultural Centre, in a stunning Georgian townhouse, was equally fascinating. Ditto the Dublin Writers Museum in Parnell Square with its replica Book of Kells among many exhibits ancient and modern.Moira I remember reading about DH Lawrence’s turbulent time in Zennor, Cornwall, when sweeping along the bracing coast on a local bus. Lawrence moved there during the first world war with his German wife Frieda, looking to escape stifling London after having had his book The Rainbow banned and being subject to travel restrictions. But he also found himself harassed by some locals in this rural idyll. He and Frieda would, reportedly, sing songs in German while traversing the lush landscape and may have got involved in a brawl or two in the local pub (The Tinner, still going strong). It all ended in tears, and the police ended up evicting Lawrence from the county, accusing him of spying. Still, he described it as the best place he had been. The cottage that he rented is still there and was owned by author Michael Morpurgo around the time he wrote War Horse.Kathleen It may be a cliche, but Stratford, without the influx of tourist coaches, is a revelation. A walking tour of the town (booked at tourist information) is a fascinating insight into the growth of a medieval town and how Stratford’s position on the London trade route may have given Shakespeare a view into a much bigger world. Then there are the theatres, the traditional pubs, the houses that provide a view of life in the past and the fabulous Compton Verney art gallery (adult £17, child free) a few miles away with its six fascinating permanent exhibitions featuring works by artists as diverse as Canaletto and Enid Marx, and – until 6 March – a beautiful light trail.Ann Tucked away in a Grade I-listed parish church, itself hidden in a narrow street, there is a shrine to Julian of Norwich. This is a reconstruction of the dwelling place of the earliest known female English writer. The anchoritic cell in which she wrote the longer version of her Revelation of Love offers a gateway into a unique literary mind of the 14th century. It is also a uniquely contemplative space, allowing each visitor to be alone with their thoughts and at peace, just as Julian must have been. Saint Julian’s Church, in Saint Julian’s Alley, off Rouen Road, is open every day 9am to around 4pm, and free to visit.GG The Llandoger Trow is a pub and restaurant in the Bristol waterfront area. This stunning 17th-century building is said to be the inspiration for Robert Louis Stevenson’s Admiral Bembow Inn in Treasure Island and as you sit there, you can picture the scene in the first chapter of the book. Stepping through the door on to the planked floor is like walking back to a time of pirates, skullduggery, rum and spittoons, but the literary history doesn’t end with Treasure Island. It is also said that Daniel Defoe met Alexander Selkirk in the Llandoger Trow about 300 years ago and his tale inspired him to write Robinson Crusoe. Any bibliophiles’ dream location.Alyson Caddick I booked to visit Marseille purely based on reading The Count of Monte Cristo. The city still holds great resemblance to the vivid descriptions in Dumas’s book. The barren Château d’If prison, surrounded by glistening seas, the narrow streets of the old town, the diverse feel of the Noailles district and the coming and going of many boats that could take me away to all the places talked about in Dumas’s novel. The heat was lingering too, with warm summer nights that reminded me of when Edmond Dantès visited Mercédès. The city still felt gritty, bustling and as proud as it had in the novel, and despite the years of modernisation, I felt like I was walking in the footsteps of Dantès.Maddy Warner There are many literary reasons to visit Florence, but for me it is the plaque in Piazza della Signoria marking the place of execution of Girolamo Savonarola. Savonarola’s Bonfire of the Vanities in 1497 and his eventual hanging (which both took place in the square) form the background to George Eliot’s superb Romola.Jeremy Reynolds At the Loch of the Green Corrie is a wonderful book by Andrew Greig in which the author seeks to find and fish a remote lochan in Assynt, Scotland, at the bequest of his dying friend, poet Norman MacCaig. A few years ago I too set out to find the Green Lochan. A remote walk from the hamlet of Inchnadamph along a stalkers’ track, crossing numerous ice-cold streams, eventually led to the rocky ridge near Glas Bheinn, and from here, on the edge of the Green Corrie, I peered down into the remote loch, with the Eas a’ Chual Aluinn, Britain’s highest waterfall, in the distance. A truly dramatic and wild landscape, captured by the author and now framed in my mind for ever.Paul Wilson My recent visit to Naples was inspired, among other reasons, by the writers who have been influenced by the city. Sartre, Dostoevsky and Oscar Wilde were classic authors enchanted by the almost operatic quality of life there – from the ancient streets and markets to the sweeping views over the Bay of Naples to Vesuvius. Then there is Penny Green’s See Naples and Die and the more recent televised novels of Elena Ferrante’s Neapolitan Quartet. In every book and every moment I spent in the city there is a heady sense of living every moment with an energising exciting intensity.Gonca  Guardian Travel readers' tips Every week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

But a family trip to Provence to quench my thirst for pines and cypresses, the mistral, pastis and boules in a hilltop village didn’t pan out. Not quite. The car got stuck between two village houses, we completely failed to find the quaint centre of Aix despite staying nearby, and initially the best food we found was a kebab on a dimly lit corner. But we finally got some feeling of Jean de Florette as we ate a meal featuring grilled local sausage and pastis as the mistral gusted through the cypresses while watching rugby on a TV.

3/3/2022,"This book sounds like a quirky piece of fiction, to set beside The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society or A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian. And it begins like a novel, as a young border guard called Jürgen Polinske stands outside the Adlershof military compound in East Berlin dreaming of ice-cream. But Polinske is a real person on his way to attend a poetry workshop. And this is the true story of how the Stasi, East Germany’s secret police, established a creative writing programme to teach its spies the art of verse. Its origins weren’t sinister but idealistic. The culture minister of the newly created GDR, Johannes Becher, dreamed of a model society in which poetry, “the very definition of everything good and beautiful, of a more meaningful, humane form of living”, would have a central place. In Nazi Germany books had been burned and authors persecuted. In the GDR, authors received generous help from the state – care packages, food vouchers, posts in government and a reduced income tax rate. Reading was heavily promoted: between 1950 and 1989, the number of books published each year tripled even as the population declined. And manual workers were encouraged to write as well as read (“Pick up the quill, comrade!”). To Becher, one verse form in particular was crucial to the establishment of the new utopia: the sonnet. In its dialectical structure – thesis, antithesis and synthesis – it mirrored the Marxist view of historical progress. If some of those who joined the circle had literary aspirations, Uwe Berger, the man in charge, with his heavy glasses and turtleneck sweater, swiftly disenchanted them. Though not a party member, he enforced an old-school party line, encouraging propagandist heroic verse that glorified the Soviet Union and vilified the capitalist enemy. Ideology good, metaphors bad was his principle; it was more important to be a communist than an artist. Poetry, he said, should “rouse emotion and boost the hunger for victory in class warfare”. Berger was also a snitch – one of the 620,000 informers on the Stasi’s books. When he wasn’t grassing on friends and neighbours (“an alcoholic”, “a bit senile”, “unstable”), he was sniffing out counter-revolutionary tendencies in the workshop he ran. As the Stasi’s institutionalised paranoia increased in the 1980s, so Berger became more vigilant. Ambiguity worried him. What was the poet hiding? Could he be an insurrectionist in the making? Berger died in 2014, but Oltermann, who is the Guardian’s Berlin bureau chief, has tracked down several of the men who attended his workshops, among them Alexander Ruika, whose poetic talent impressed but also alarmed Berger, and whose potential for dissidence was headed off when he, too, was recruited as an informant. Ruika was tasked with gathering intelligence on Gert Neumann, a locksmith by trade, whose fiction and poetry were “like locked rooms with keys gone missing” – so cryptic no critic could decipher them, and so alarming to the Stasi that they also recruited Neumann’s mother and wife to spy on him. Thirty years on, Oltermann brings the two men together, in a kind of truth and reconciliation exercise over a meal. Though its poetry workshops were dominated by men, the Stasi also kept a close eye on any female poet suspected of subversion. They’d been watching Annegret Gollin since she was a teenager, because her smoking, drinking and love of discos marked her out as a troublemaker. And after their attention was drawn to a puzzling unpublished poem she’d written about concrete, they pounced on her in a cobbled square, bundled her into the back of a car, and raided her flat, where further incriminating notebooks were found. In the months after her arrest, the Stasi interrogated her 36 times. The concrete poem was judged to show signs of corrupting western influence. For her decadent tendencies, she spent 20 months in prison, while her small son was placed in a children’s home. By 1984 morale within the Stasi was suffering. The Wall couldn’t keep out western influence. There were stirrings of a peace movement among the young. Even the military preferred Eric Clapton and Steven Spielberg to homegrown music and films. But the leaders of East Germany were old and the country was slower to accept glasnost than the rest of the Soviet bloc. At least the end was bloodless: whereas Nazi Germany went up in flames, in the GDR “there were no burnt bodies, only pulped files”. The Stasi’s troubled relationship with poetry makes a bizarre, tragi-comic story, and Oltermann tells it extremely well. It’s easy to mock the crassness of the Soviet approach to artistic practice. But as the author points out, the CIA also used culture as a political weapon by funding artists such as Jackson Pollock. And of course it was better for the cold war to be fought that way – not with nuclear bombs but as a battle between abstract expressionism and socialist realism.

3/3/2022,"Stories are powerful. That’s the essential premise of Zana Fraillon’s 2016 novel, written to spotlight the experiences of child refugees. As Pilot Theatre adapts The Bone Sparrow, with the nationality and borders bill going through parliament, such stories are as necessary as ever. For Fraillon’s characters, stories are survival. Young protagonist Subhi (Yaamin Chowdhury) is a “limbo kid”, born in an Australian detention centre. He and his family are Rohingya Muslims, being held indefinitely after fleeing violence and persecution. Subhi endures this bleak environment by escaping into his imagination. One night, he meets Jimmie (Mary Roubos), a girl on the other side of the fence with a notebook full of stories left behind by her late mother. Esther Richardson’s production effectively conveys the grinding monotony of life in captivity, in which one day bleeds into the next. The towering fences of Miriam Nabarro’s set are manoeuvred into multiple configurations, suggesting the many featureless spaces of the detention centre – all of them contained by metal and barbed wire. Only when the two children read Jimmie’s mother’s stories do these barriers briefly recede. But the show struggles to make this harsh reality theatrically compelling. In S Shakthidharan’s uneven adaptation, the narrative remains novelistic rather than dramatic. Scenes lack forward momentum, while the various subplots often feel out of balance. And for a piece made for younger audiences, there’s a surprising lack of clarity to the storytelling. There are some striking visual sequences and some lovely moments between Subhi and Jimmie. Overall, though, The Bone Sparrow makes a clumsy transition from page to stage. Stories are indeed powerful – it’s just a shame this one isn’t told more engagingly.

3/3/2022,"Astained, lidless plastic container rests on electric weighing scales. Next to it sits a sunken, shredded man, his hands shaking as he holds the knife to carve the pound of flesh he is owed. In Abigail Graham’s brutal, lonely production of The Merchant of Venice, there is no question of who the victim is. Shylock, played heart-wrenchingly by Adrian Schiller, is repeatedly spat at and hounded by vulgar city boys who hide their actions behind the crosses round their necks. By the time we reach the infamous scene of revenge, Shylock’s bind to his oath seems just. These men have taken so much from him, it only seems fair for him to take something back. Shakespeare’s challenging text has been streamlined to a neat two hours in this contemporary production. Its innards have been snipped and significantly shuffled, so that we start with Launcelot (Aaron Vodovoz) switching allegiance from Shylock to Bassiano (Michael Marcus). Joining the toxic antisemitic boys while they’re out drinking, they make Launcelot do a shot every time he says the word “Jew”. Shylock’s devastating “If they prick us, do we not bleed?” speech is shifted powerfully to the end of the first half. The result is a production cleanly cut, sharply told. Jarring with Shylock’s bleak storyline are the glitzy scenes in search of Portia’s husband. These hammed-up sections are uncannily well suited to the style of noughties TV gameshows, but they feel cut from a different play until Bassanio leaps on to the golden podium. He and Portia (Sophie Melville) spark off each other, slinky and playful as she manipulates his choice towards the winning box. The chemistry between Nerissa (Tripti Tripuraneni) and Gratiano (Raymond Anum) is strong too, leading to a hilarious wedding scene where sweet dancing devolves into debauchery. The relationship between Shylock and his daughter Jessica (Eleanor Wyld) isn’t given enough stage time for their storyline to really wallop us, but the aesthetics and choices of the production’s final scene more than make up for it.

3/3/2022,"In his new book, Donald Trump’s former attorney general William Barr complains that in the US, the “most educated and influential people are more attached to self-serving narratives than to factual truth”. But in his own narrative of his tumultuous time as Trump’s top lawyer, Barr regularly omits inconvenient truths or includes self-serving versions of events previously reported with his evident input. Barr was only the second US attorney general to fill the role twice, working for George HW Bush from 1991 to 1993, then succeeding Jeff Sessions in 2019. His memoir, One Damn Thing After Another, will be published on 8 March. Excerpts have been reported by US news outlets. The Guardian obtained a copy. As widely reported, Barr defends himself from accusations that he was too close to Trump and acted to shield him over the Russia investigation and Robert Mueller’s final report on election interference and links between Trump and Moscow. He defends his decision to say Trump did not seek to obstruct justice during Mueller’s work, despite Mueller laying out 10 possible instances of such potentially criminal conduct. Barr also defends his decision to seek to dismiss charges against Michael Flynn and to lessen the sentence handed to Roger Stone, Trump allies convicted as a result of the Russia investigation. On other controversies, Barr’s accounts are often highly selective or noticeably incomplete. In June 2020, Barr was engulfed in controversy over the removal of Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney in the southern district of New York. Berman was investigating Trump’s business and allies including Rudy Giuliani. He was also supervising a case involving a Turkish bank which the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, pressured Trump to drop. Shortly after John Bolton, Trump’s third national security adviser, said Trump promised Erdoğan he would get rid of leaders in the southern district, Barr announced Berman was stepping down. When Berman said he would not quit, he was fired. The incident prompted calls for Barr to resign, including from the New York City Bar Association. In his book, Barr praises the “quality and experience of the group of US attorneys I inherited” and says he told them “to go full speed ahead on the department’s existing priorities”. He also says he regrets not installing an aide, Ed O’Callaghan, “into his dream job – US attorney in the southern district of New York”. But he does not mention Berman and how or why he fired him. Barr also defends his decision to restart federal executions after 17 years, which lead to 13 state killings in the final six months of Trump’s presidency. Barr describes, with apparent relish, the crimes of many of those killed. He does not mention Lisa Montgomery, the first woman executed by the federal government in 67 years, whose lawyers argued she had brain damage from beatings as a child and suffered from psychosis and other mental conditions, having been sexually abused. Barr also outlines why he thinks Trump lost the election and should not run again. His former boss’s volcanic anger is repeatedly described. Detailing Trump’s fury during protests against racial injustice outside the White House in June 2020 – after confirming that Trump was once hustled to a protective bunker, which Trump denied – Barr writes: “The president lost his composure. “Glaring around the semi-circle of officials in front of his desk, he swept his index finger around the semi-circle, pointing at all of us. ‘You’re all losers!’ he yelled, his face reddening … ‘You’re losers!’ he yelled again, tiny flecks of spit arcing to his desktop. ‘Fucking losers!’ It was a tantrum.” After that tantrum, peaceful protesters were violently cleared from Lafayette Square before Trump walked to a historic church to stage a photoshoot holding a Bible. Barr and other senior aides made the walk too. It was widely reported that Barr ordered the clearance. In his book, Barr says Trump told him to “take the lead” in dealing with the protesters. But he echoes an official report in saying the clearance was already planned by police. Barr portrays himself and other aides obstructing or defying Trump’s demands, including pressure to investigate Hunter Biden, Joe Biden’s son, and the contents of a laptop obtained by Giuliani. “I cut him off again,” Barr writes, “raising my voice. ‘Dammit, Mr President! I can’t talk about that, and I am not going to!’ “He was silent for a moment, then quickly got off the line.” Barr also gives space to his falling out with Trump over the president’s lie about electoral fraud in his defeat by Joe Biden – a rupture which happened after Barr controversially ordered the Department of Justice to investigate electoral fraud claims, a decision he now defends. A tempestuous meeting between Trump and Barr on 1 December 2021, at which the attorney general told the president no widespread fraud existed, has been widely reported. Such accounts do not say Barr attempted to resign. In his memoir, he says he did and that Trump accepted but was talked around. In his account of a meeting on 14 December 2020 at which he did resign, Barr says Trump first gave him a report which the president claimed contained “absolute proof that the Dominion machines were rigged [and] I won the election and will have a second term”. The House oversight committee released the report in June 2021, detailing how Trump sent it to Barr’s replacement, Jeffrey Rosen, shortly after Barr left his resignation meeting. But accounts of that meeting in books by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa (Peril) and Jonathan Karl (Betrayal), heavily informed by Barr, do not say Trump gave Barr the report and that Barr, in his own words, said he would look into it. The report was produced by Allied Security Operations Group (ASOG), which Barr says “described itself as a cybersecurity firm in Texas”, and purported to deal with events in Antrim county, Michigan, a Republican area where a clerking error appeared to give Biden victory before a Trump win was confirmed. The report, Barr writes, concluded that voting machines were “intentionally and purposefully designed with inherent errors to create systemic fraud and influence election results”. Barr calls the report “amateurish” and “sensational” and its conclusion “an ipse dixit, a bald claim without even the pretense of supporting evidence”. Dominion Voting Systems, the company which made the machines, has sued Trump allies including Giuliani, Mike Lindell and Fox News, seeking billions in damages. Trump has not commented on Barr’s book. But he has previously called his attorney general – who many saw as a ruthless “hatchet man”, determined to do the president’s bidding – “afraid, weak and frankly … pathetic”.",Arts/Books,William Barr’s Trump book: self-serving narratives and tricky truths ignored,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/03/william-barr-attorney-general-trump-book
3/3/2022,"In the late summer of 2020, Bruce Bartman went to Pennsylvania’s voter registration website and signed up his mother and mother-in-law to vote. Both women were dead. A few months later, Bartman, who is white, requested a mail-in ballot for his late mother and cast her vote for Donald Trump. Bartman was arrested that December and charged with perjury and unlawful voting. Months later, he pleaded guilty, admitted he made a “stupid mistake,” was sentenced to five years of probation and barred from serving on a jury or voting for four years. “There’s not public benefit to him being incarcerated,” Jack Stollsteimer, the local district attorney said at the time. “This defendant from the beginning has accepted responsibility for his actions, and he has paid the price for them.” When Bartman pleaded guilty, nearly 1,000 miles away, in Memphis, a Black Lives Matter activist named Pamela Moses was facing her own election-related criminal charges. A few years previously, Moses, who is Black, permanently lost the right to vote after committing a felony. But no one had actually removed Moses from the voter rolls or told her she couldn’t vote. And in 2019, when state officials began looking into her eligibility, a probation officer signed a certificate saying Moses had completed her sentence and was eligible to vote. So she applied to do so. Even though corrections officials conceded they made an error, Moses was indicted anyway. Moses was convicted by a jury in November. In late January, she was sentenced to six years and one day in prison Her sentence attracted widespread national scrutiny for its harshness – it is among the most severe for an election-related crime issued in recent memory. Following weeks of outcry and the introduction of new evidence revealed by the Guardian, a judge ordered a new trial for Moses last week. Despite that unusual reversal, the case also underscored what many experts see as a double standard in the US criminal justice system: white people face relatively light punishment for intentional cases of fraud, while Black people face tougher punishments for unintentional voting errors. No comprehensive data exists comparing voter fraud prosecutions based on race. It’s also difficult to compare prosecutions in different jurisdictions because a criminal sentence depends on many factors, including the discretion of the local prosecutor, state laws, the facts of the offense, and the defendant’s criminal history. But the experts say the cases that have come to prominence ring alarm bells. “This [Moses] conviction has resonated across the country, the world, and it certainly has resonated in this community. I would suggest that it certainly resonated with Black women who might wonder if they’re eligible to vote in the coming elections,” said Josh Spickler, the executive director of Just City, a criminal justice non-profit in Memphis. “It is what you think it is. It is voter suppression. It is a message to consider whether you should vote or not.” Moses’ case immediately attracted comparisons to the case of Crystal Mason, a Texas woman who was sentenced to five years in prison for voting while on federal supervised release – similar to probation – in 2016. Probation officials testified that they never told Mason she couldn’t vote, and her ballot was never counted, but a judge found her guilty of illegally voting anyway. An appeal is currently pending at Texas’ highest criminal court. Last summer, Texas officials also arrested Hervis Rogers, who is Black, for voting while on probation for a felony. Rogers, who received national attention after waiting seven hours in line to vote in 2020, also says didn’t know he was ineligible. His case is currently pending and he could face years in prison. “What we do see is that there’s a willingness to go after people who are making, at worst, innocent mistakes. That’s not what our justice system should be about,” said Thomas Buser-Clancy, a lawyer with the Texas chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union who is helping represent both Mason and Rogers. These relatively long sentences stand out even more given several recent examples in which white defendants who committed acts of fraud received no prison time at all. Last year, a 72-year old Republican voter in Pennsylvania was sentenced to probation after putting on sunglasses and trying to impersonate his son at the polls. In Arizona, a 64-year-old woman pleaded guilty to forging her deceased mother’s signature on a mail-in ballot; she was sentenced to probation and could face up to 90 days in jail when she’s sentenced in March. In Nevada, a Republican who voted using his dead wife’s ballot and then lied about it pleaded guilty and was sentenced to probation. And in 2018, about a month after Mason was sentenced, a white justice of the peace in the same county pleaded guilty to forging signatures to get on the ballot when he was running for office. He was sentenced to probation. “You have Ms. Mason’s case of what at worst is an innocent mistake…on the other hand you have someone who intentionally - you can’t innocently forge signatures, and they received probation,” said Buser-Clancy. “It’s the same county, same DA, very different results, when you would expect it to go the opposite way.” In Texas, the prosecutor who handled Mason’s case defended the harsh sentence by noting that she offered her a plea deal with probation. “Our office offered Mason the option of probation in this case, which she refused. She chose to have a trial by judge, and the judge found beyond a reasonable doubt from the evidence that she knew she wasn’t eligible to vote and voted anyway,” she said in 2019. Amy Weirich, the district attorney in Memphis who prosecuted Moses, also defended her handling of the case in part by noting that she offered Moses a plea deal that didn’t involve incarceration. “I gave her a chance to plead to a misdemeanor with no prison time,” Weirich said in a statement. “She requested a jury trial instead. She set this unfortunate result in motion and a jury of her peers heard the evidence and convicted her.” “It’s a fact for various reasons that people who go to trial generally get harsher sentences,” said Daniel Richman, a law professor at Columbia University who has written extensively about prosecutors. “Sometimes you hear arguments, and there’s some substance to them, that the prosecution is seeking to punish the defendant for going to trial, and I’m sure that happens. But another thing that always happens is the judge knows the case a lot better. And generally, when a judge knows a case a lot better, the defendant is worse off.” But the decision to reject a plea and go to trial, a constitutional right in the US, shouldn’t necessarily lead to a harsher sentence, experts say. For someone who already has a criminal record like Mason or Moses, accepting a plea deal for a new crime can have severe consequences, such as the revocation of probation or losing a job. “Why is it we have a system where a prosecutor can basically say to somebody, you plead, we’ll extend your probation. If you don’t plead, you’re facing six years. Does that sound like the kind of system we want?,” said Bennett Capers, a former federal prosecutor who now teaches law at Fordham University. “If [Moses] had taken the plea, nobody would have known about this case.” Prosecutors have also defended the sentences for Moses and Mason by pointing to their prior criminal records. But in the US, having a criminal conviction means navigating an enormously confusing set of rules in order to regain one’s vote, and such rules vary widely by state. Those confusing voting rules are more likely to affect Black Americans like Moses and Mason. Over one-fifth of Black people of voting age in Moses’ home state of Tennessee – nearly 175,000 people – can’t vote because of a felony conviction, according to an estimate by The Sentencing Project, a criminal justice non-profit. There is a stark racial disparity. Around 17% of Tennessee’s population is Black, but Black people account for around 40% of those disenfranchised because of a felony conviction in the state. Nationally, around 2.3% of the voting age population can’t vote because of a felony conviction. But it is 6.3% of Black Americans of voting age. “This is much more likely to have a disparate effect on people who are Black and brown. People who are Black and Brown are more likely to have a conviction,” Capers said. The Moses case “sort of sends a message that ‘you know, by the way, don’t think about going to the polls’”, Capers said.",News/US news,A white man got probation for voting fraud.

3/3/2022,"Every weekend for most of her youth, while other children were out playing, Natalia Toroshenko attended Ukrainian school, studying the country’s geography, language, its history and national heroes. “Ukraine, and being Ukrainian, is a deep part of me,” she said. “I wasn’t born there, but it’s my ancestral homeland.” Toroshenko grew up in Montreal, thousands of kilometres away from the country her father had left to flee famine and conflict. But, she like many other Ukrainian Canadians, has maintained strong connections to the country – and watched horrified as family and friends are trapped in war. Canada is home to 1.4 million people of Ukrainian descent – the world’s second largest Ukrainian diaspora after Russia. Tens of thousands of Ukrainians farmed the country’s west. The spires of their churches still dot rural landscapes and large cities. Prominent community leaders and politicians are of Ukrainian ancestry, including Canada’s deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland. Those cultural and political ties are particularly prominent in the Canadian Prairies, where generations Ukrainians have braided their culture and history into the vast landscape. In the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, hundreds of one room schoolhouses were once named after Ukrainian figures and communities. Nearly 30 towns and a handful of parks are named after places and people from Ukraine Vegreville, Alberta, where Toroshenko now lives, boasts one of the world’s largest pysankas – an intricately painted Ukrainian Easter egg weighing more than 5,500 pounds and drawing thousands of curious tourists each year. In recent weeks, a sombre mood has taken hold in the farming community . “Each morning on television I watch Kyiv getting bombed all over the place. I see images of Ukrainians taking up arms. Regular people, as young as 18, defending their country,” Toroshenko said. “It’s horrific.” As Ukrainian-Canadians pore over news accounts and social media the Russian invasion has also unearthed painful memories of their own family histories – many of which are marked by conflict, dispossession and exile. “My father chose to come here for a better life,” she said. “He wanted a place where he could be free and where if he worked hard, he and others could make something of themselves.” That history inspired Toroshenko to return the favor to her family’s homeland, traveling ten times to Ukraine as an elections observer. But as the war continues, she fears the democratic structures she and thousands of others helped establish over the years are under threat of collapse – as is the dream of what Ukraine could become. Canada’s deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland, who grew up in a tight-knit rural Ukrainian community in the Prairies, spoke last week to the country’s diaspora, offering words of hope. “When she spoke, she used the first line of the national anthem. She said ‘Ukraine has not yet perished,” said Toroshenko. “It was amazing to hear. It really resonated with us. It moved us.” Others have tried to shake off the sense of powerlessness, drawing instead on the tightness of the community. “Immigrating to Canada was hard for us, as it is for most people. But to be able to see ourselves in the Ukrainians who came before us was an inspiration. It showed us there was a place for us here – and a path for us to follow,” said Zoya Kostetsky, a Winnipeg-based artisan who moved from to Canada from the Ukrainian city of Lviv in 2005. She attended one of the ten English-Ukrainian bilingual schools in the province and found a strong cultural network to help her settle in Canada: “We found a sense of community. They spoke the language, they followed the same traditions and celebrated the same holidays.” As she stood with her family at a recent rally against the war, she was struck by how the grief she felt was shared across the crowd. “Everyone was suffering. Everyone had someone they were worried about. And in a grim way, it made it easier.” Desperate to help in some way, she organized a raffle with prizes from local businesses, and raised more than C$20,000 to aid in relief efforts. But the knowledge that if her family hadn’t left, they too would be facing the prospect of fighting in the war has left a heavy mark on her. “My dad is still young enough to be in the military, so he would be in the war. I would be in the war. My mom is a medic, so she would be doing medical work in the war. My brother would be in the war,” she said. “Our whole family would be fighting on the frontlines.” The funds she has raised have gone to help both citizens fighting and those fleeing to neighboring countries, and Kostetsky said the gratitude from aid groups in Ukraine – and the overwhelming support of the broader community around her, have kept her motivated. “I’ll keep doing what I can every day until this is over,” she said. “Because until then I won’t be able to relax at all. I can’t just sit back and watch as this country gets destroyed.”",News/World news,"In Canada, world’s second largest Ukrainian diaspora grieves invasion",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/03/canada-ukraine-diaspora-relief-efforts-russia-attack
3/3/2022,"For Nina, the prospect of walking into a police station and reporting her stepfather for child sexual abuse was, she says, her “worst nightmare ... It was something I’d dreaded my whole life,” she says. She had been raped by her stepfather for years when she was a child – and he had promised all sorts of consequences if she ever told anyone. Her mother, he told her, would kill herself. He implied that he might, too – but one thing he always assured her was that he would never go to jail. When she was in her late teens, Nina finally told her mum, who was devastated, but believed her. It took years, however, before she felt ready to press charges. “One of the things that stopped me from telling anyone that it was happening at the time was the terror of standing in a courtroom putting all that shame on show – and that felt even worse the older I got. “It took a good few years before I realised that the right thing to do was to prosecute. It had got to the point where ‘little Nina’ would have wanted it to happen; I felt like I was doing it for my childhood self and for all the other little Ninas out there who were still suffering. I had a duty beyond any pain it would cause me – but I had no clue of the price I’d be paying.” Nina made the report in 2016. She subsequently gave a detailed video interview with the police. “It felt good to get it done,” she says. Rather than “overwhelm” her with continual contact, the police suggested they only get in touch when there was progress on the case. “I thought that sounded all right, but then you wait six months, eight months, 10 months, without hearing anything,” says Nina. “What’s going on? You start to wonder: is it OK? Is anything happening? Are they investigating?” At times, it felt almost as if the move that had seemed so momentous, that had taken all of Nina’s courage, had made no mark or had never happened. “I had no paperwork, not a single letter, nothing at all to show it was on record or in the system other than a crime number that was dictated to me down the phone at some point,” she says. “The thing that horrifies me is that at the start of each new year, I think, ‘OK, maybe this year, it’ll all be over, something will happen and I can finally put it behind me and get on with my life’ – but it never is. It has been five years now with the police and CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] ping-ponging the case between each other. My stepfather is still living his life without consequences and we haven’t even got to a charging decision. “It casts a shadow over everything I plan, any choice I make, this feeling that something could happen any time so I have to keep it all top of my mind when all my instincts are telling me not to. My testimony is relying on the fact that I’m remembering something that I’m desperately trying to forget.” Figures for England and Wales have shown the typical delay between an offence of rape and a resulting criminal case rose to 1,000 days in 2021. According to the Criminal Bar Association, the backlog of trials for sexual offences has risen by 125% in the past three years. This, of course, shows only the tip of the iceberg, since a fraction of reported sex offences will get to trial – 2.9% resulted in charges in the year to September 2021, according to figures released by the Home Office. (The prosecution rate for rape cases is even lower, at 1.3%.) The 1,000-day wait doesn’t count survivors like Nina, whose case has been languishing for almost double that. The pandemic is often cited as a cause, but multiple factors have played a part here. “In some ways, Covid feels like a convenient excuse,” says Francesca Jarvis from Rape Crisis South London. “The system was already buckling.” According to Jarvis, these waiting times are the result of a “perfect storm”. At the legal end, we’ve had a decade of court closures, the defunding of criminal legal aid and the growing shortage of barristers. At investigation stage, the case of Liam Allan at the end of 2017, where a rape trial collapsed because crucial mobile phone evidence had been withheld from the defence, has led to a level of caution in police and CPS that, Jarvis says, “completely changed the landscape”. Kate Ellis, a solicitor with Centre for Women’s Justice, agrees that the impact of this case on waiting times is “hard to overstate”. It tapped into fears around sexual offences and false allegations, and the police and CPS really came under fire. “Many believe the pendulum quickly swayed too far in the other direction, as investigations now seem very focused on the victim’s credibility, on the police and CPS proactively gathering evidence that may assist the defence – health records, phone records, there’s a huge volume of evidence in a digital age. It has raised difficult questions about where to stop.” At times in the past five years, Nina has felt more like the suspect than the survivor. “The only ‘updates’ I get are when the CPS ask for something more,” she says. “They asked for my medical records, which I gave them, although I regretted that a little bit as they then started getting really invasive.” Next, the CPS asked for her mobile phone. “That was a real conundrum,” says Nina. “This happened when I was a child. I don’t have the same phone any more. There’s nothing on my phone that could relate to that period and the idea of allowing the defence, my abuser, to see what my life is like now feels so exposing. The irony is that this is a crime of consent, but the CPS can’t take no for an answer. They asked me three times, and three times I refused. The fourth time, I gave in and we came to an arrangement where they could scroll through. They wanted to confirm that I hadn’t been colluding with my mum. It just feels so violating.” Oona Brooks, a reader in criminology at Glasgow University, has studied the impact of waiting times on sexual assault survivors as part of a project funded by the Scottish government. She describes a process of “secondary victimisation”. “Sexual assault takes control away from someone and the criminal justice process replicates that sense of powerlessness,” she says. “Survivors describe living in a heightened state of anxiety – awaiting the next update, not knowing what will happen next, wondering if they’re taken seriously, feeling really unimportant. “They know they may be expected to recall details two, three, even four years later. One male survivor described waking in the night and writing things down so he wouldn’t forget them. Effectively, you’re having to hold on to these details and remain as a ‘victim’ instead of beginning to process them, in order to live your life.” Therapy for survivors coping with such pressures can be sorely needed, but accessing it is hugely problematic. Case notes can currently be requested by the defence – leaving many survivors feeling unsafe discussing complex feelings around guilt, self-blame and uncertainty in therapy. Rape Crisis is calling for therapy and counselling notes to be made non-disclosable. Likewise, there are restrictions on what you might say to others, or to whom you can talk at all, which can become increasingly unmanageable as time stretches. Brooks gives the example of a case involving rape in the context of domestic abuse, where a woman’s child might be called to give evidence. “She was concerned about what she could say to her own child, how she could help her child, and answer her questions or if she might be accused of coaching.” The pressures on daily life are immense. “Most survivors know their attacker,” says Brooks. “It’s likely he will be out on bail. He probably knows the same people, you’ll have friends or family in common, some will take sides. Survivors told me about the accused harassing and intimidating family members. One no longer felt able to use the local shops.” Monica is part of a multi-victim rape and sexual assault trial that has taken three years to come to court partly because of pandemic-related postponements. The years have added layers of trauma. Monica isn’t British, her visa has expired since reporting the case and she had to fight for discretionary leave with working rights attached – at one point, forced to live on a grant of £39 a week. “My family have no idea what happened to me,” she says. “My life was like a horror movie and a parent only wants to see that on TV. If I’d gone home, I’d have taken this broken chapter with me. I’d have felt unable to talk to anyone about the case, I’d have no support structures around me, I’d have kept everything hidden – but still it would be hanging over me and I’d have been expected to recall it all and help convict a dangerous man years later when the time came. “This wait, and the way I’ve been treated have been so difficult,” she continues. “I’m writing a victim impact statement now and the initial outrage about what was done to me has been so clouded and coloured by the years since that it’s difficult to pick it apart and examine on its own.” Nina feels the same. “I look at my friends moving on with their lives and think: ‘My childhood was stolen from me, but why does my adulthood continue to be taken from me, too?’ I worry about planning anything nice in case something happens with the case to ruin it. I’m supposed to be getting married, but I’m worried I’ll get a call, or news, or a trial date. “Booking a holiday, starting a new job, starting a family – it’s the same for everything,” she says. “I’d love to have kids, I’m at the point where I’ll shortly be able to do that, but I can’t imagine going through the court process or risk slowing it down with a pregnancy or a baby. I’ve told three different employers about it now, which is ridiculous.” There have been some moves to speed up the process. But Ellis is dubious about introducing time targets for the investigation stage. “There was a police force piloting them, but it seemed to result in cases not being investigated at all,” she says. “I’d like investigations to be more focused on the suspect and evidence of the offence, rather than so much time being spent investigating the victim. The real problem is resources – at the moment, we have overstretched officers and prosecutors with a massive case load.” At court level, Brooks supports a radical overhaul. “They’ve introduced some additional courts and digital technology for remote hearings, but that is tinkering around the edges of a system that isn’t working,” she says. Brooks is a keen supporter of proposals to introduce specialist-judge-only sexual violence courts in Scotland – something supported by Rape Crisis as a key step to improve the survivor experience. On 25 February, a joint inspection by police and CPS of the investigation and prosecution of rape cases in England and Wales found poor communication between police and CPS and also with the victims from the point of charge onwards. Its recommendations included the use of specialist rape courts. In the meantime, it is hardly surprising that crime outcomes for the year ending March 2021 showed that 33% of reported sexual offences were closed, because victims dropped out of the prosecution. There are moments when Nina would also like to walk away, but, as yet, she hasn’t. “I’m not confident that I’ll get to court,” she says. “I’m well aware that anything could happen. One of his friends asked me to withdraw because ‘he’s so old’, and: ‘Does it really make a difference?’ “I’m proceeding because it’s the right thing to do – but with each passing year, his promise that I was never going to see justice for this rings louder.”  Survivor names have been changed.  Rape Crisis offers support for rape and sexual abuse on 0808 802 9999 in England and Wales, 0808 801 0302 in Scotland or 0800 0246 991 in Northern Ireland.

3/3/2022,"A war crimes investigation has been launched into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine after an unprecedented number of countries backed the move and Boris Johnson called the military intervention “abhorrent”. Karim Khan, the chief prosecutor for the international criminal court (ICC), said he would begin work “as rapidly as possible” to look for possible crimes against humanity or genocide committed in Ukraine. The referral for investigation by 39 countries – including the UK – will shave several months off the process because it allows Khan to bypass the need to seek the approval of the court in The Hague. It came as Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, braced for a siege and the Russian defence ministry claimed it was in “complete control” of Kherson, a southern port city near the Crimean peninsula. Support local charities There are several Ukrainian charities working on the ground. Sunflower of Peace is a charity that helps paramedics and doctors, and has been fundraising for supplies, which includes first aid medical tactical backpacks. United Help Ukraine focuses on providing medical supplies and humanitarian aid, and raising awareness of the conflict. Voices of Children aims to help children affected by the war in eastern Ukraine, providing support through art therapy, psychologists, video storytelling and a number of other methods. The British Red Cross has launched an emergency appeal to help Ukraine. The charity will be updating its webpage with news on the work its team is doing, and how support will be used to help people. Support local journalism English-language news outlets based in the country, such as Kyiv Independent and the New Voice of Ukraine, are covering developments on the ground as the conflict unfolds, using local journalists. The Kyiv Independent says it was created by journalists in order to defend editorial independence. This site on Twitter covers many local journalists in Ukraine.

Khan said an “advanced team” of investigators was already travelling to Ukraine. The British lawyer told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme the push for an inquiry by so many countries “allows us to jump-start investigations” and came on top of “evidence of international concern over events on the ground in Ukraine”. “Individuals have rights to have their interests vindicated and for justice to prevail,” Khan said. “That can only take place if evidence is independently and impartially collected and assessed and then in due course, decisions can be made regarding whether or not there’s criminal responsibility, and then the judges ultimately will decide.” Asked about reports Russia was using cluster bombs in civilian areas, Khan said “it is clear … directing attacks against civilians and civilian objects amounts to a war crime”. The ICC investigation will look back as far as 21 November 2013, when Ukraine’s then president rejected closer integration with the EU, leading to huge protests that precipitated Russia’s annexation of Crimea. Liz Truss, the UK foreign secretary, accused the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, of “targeting civilians indiscriminately” and directing troops to tear through towns across Ukraine. “The UK will work closely with allies to ensure justice is done,” she said. The UK justice secretary, Dominic Raab, told the Daily Telegraph Britain could house Russian commanders suspected of war crimes in its prisons – and act as a safe haven for witnesses who testified against them. He said that “few countries around the world” had the UK’s “lead information”, which would likely prove “absolutely critical” to the ICC. As the Russian invasion entered its eighth day, the UN refugee agency estimated that 1 million people had now fled Ukraine, making it the swiftest exodus of refugees this century. More than 2,000 civilians had died since the invasion began, Ukraine’s state emergency service said. Moscow’s international isolation was further displayed when the UN general assembly voted overwhelmingly to demand Putin immediately withdraw Russian troops: 141 nations backed the motion and only five, including the alleged co-aggressor Belarus, opposed it. The UK government has been criticised for the pace of sanctions being levelled on Russians close to Putin and their business interests. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, questioned on Wednesday why it would take 18 months for a new register of property ownership to apply to existing owners. Frans Timmermans, first vice-president of the European Commission, said he thought the UK was “following our lead”. After it was revealed the Conservatives had accepted an £80,000 donation from the former wife of one of Putin’s ministers within the last six months, Timmermans added: “I think even parties who accepted funding from oligarchs should understand that they need to change course. Because, if I don’t misunderstand the mood in the UK, that’s what the British public want” Damian Hinds, the UK security minister, told LBC radio: “I don’t accept that my political party accepts money from illegitimate sources.” Hinds also welcomed the ICC investigation and said all indications suggested that Putin “is guilty” of war crimes. UK officials have said more sanctions are coming, against oligarchs, Russian national security council members and banks, and that they believe the economic shock of the moves has been more significant than Putin was expecting. ",News/World news,ICC launches war crimes investigation over Russian invasion of Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/03/icc-launches-war-crimes-investigation-russia-invasion-ukraine
3/3/2022,"An Indigenous community from Cabbage Tree Island in the New South Wales northern rivers region fears they have lost everything in the floods. Residents from all 23 households were forced to flee as water inundated the island, which is off Ballina and has been an Indigenous reserve since 1893. Dyonne Anderson, the principal of Cabbage Tree Island public school, feared her students won’t be able to return for months because of the flood damage. “It’s gone totally over the school even though that’s on the highest part of the island,” Anderson said. “So we know that the water damage is extremely severe for the community. “There are people that have just left with the clothes on their back. So they’re going to come back to a whole great deal of loss.” People had been placed in accomodation until at least Monday, Anderson said. “But I think it’s going to be much longer longer than that [before they can return],” she said, noting the two bridges to get there may be damaged too. The school, which counts 43 students from 3.5 years old up to 12, will probably need major repairs. “We may not return for many months,” Anderson said. It comes as the government’s response to the flooding came under fire from Greens and Labor MPs. Greens MP Tamara Smith was dismayed by the lack of coordination among government relief agencies, relying on a local armada of as many as 150 private boats to rescue stranded people and deliver supplies five days after rivers broke their banks. “The anger is palpable,” said Greens MP Tamara Smith. “It’s like, what’s the use of governments if they can’t support people at these pointy moments?” Evening conference calls with emergency services have left locals “absolutely frustrated”, Smith said. Concerns ranged from empty shops to a helicopter being used to deliver medicine to a single person because other needs weren’t known or catered for. Ballina Shire has just 18 SES volunteers for 32,000 people. “Once you go out into the hills, you’re basically cut off, you’ve got nobody there,” Smith said. Lismore, a flood-prone town that beat its previous record flood by two metres, is struggling to find homes for evacuees. About 800 people were temporarily located at the local campus of Southern Cross University, according to Labor MP Janelle Saffin. The Greens have called for a permanent rapid response team to be set up to respond to disasters, a proposal Saffin supports in light of the difficulties she is seeing on the ground.

Challenges for many people include obtaining food but also the fuel needed to secure essential supplies. Both Ampol and BP blamed access problems rather than a supply shortage. Flooding and road closures were making it difficult to reach retail outlets, both companies said, with a number of service stations forced to close. Ampol shut five retail stores across the northern regions and north coast, including both stores in Lismore, adding a “number of our employees have been directly impacted”. It said it was working directly with emergency services to maintain adequate supplies. BP said it was “working closely with partners and local authorities to navigate the impacts of the weather”. Ballina mayor Sharon Cadwallader said emergency services in her area had managed to secure an emergency fuel from one local service station but the some faced big difficulties. The outlets that did have fuel were unable to use cards and the stations were out of cash. “I’m not aware that we’ve had any fuel supply whatsoever,” she told the Guardian, adding that food was also running low including in evacuation centres. “We managed to get a canoe to get some food supplies out of one of the charities that wasn’t affected - well it was affected, but a lot of product wasn’t. So that was good,” Cadwallader said. The industry peak group, the Australasian Convenience and Petroleum Marketers Association, described the damage to outlets as “unprecedented” . “There are service stations where the water is basically to the top of the canopy,” chief executive Mark McKenzie told the ABC. “It’s going to be some time in those areas before we can get fuel flowing again.” Guardian Australia contacted the NSW premier Dominic Perrottet’s office and Resilience NSW for a response",News/Australia news,Fears for Indigenous community of NSW island as anger rises about government’s flood response,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/03/fears-for-indigenous-community-of-nsw-island-as-anger-rises-about-government-response
3/3/2022,"Hello and good morning. Russia has captured the city of Kherson. The Black Sea port has become the first major Ukrainian target to fall under the de facto control of Russia forces. As the international criminal court said it had begun collecting evidence of possible war crimes in Ukraine, Kherson’s mayor, Igor Kolykhaiev, said in a Facebook post today Russian troops were in control of the city hall and that residents should obey a curfew imposed by “armed visitors”. Russian artillery and missiles have continued to bombard other key cities including the capital, Kyiv, but the advance into the capital itself has stalled. The United Nations said more than a million people had fled the country since the invasion began a week ago. As the conflict entered its second week, the UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, said there had been an “exodus” from Ukraine to neighbouring countries of more than 1 million people, or about 2% of the population of 44 million. How high could refugee numbers climb? The UN estimates there could be as many as 4 million refugees from the invasion, crossing the borders into neighbouring countries. How many Russian soldiers have been sent to their deaths by president Vladimir Putin so far? Ukraine’s government said yesterday nearly 6,000 Russian troops had been killed. Moscow said the figure was 498. How many international allies does Russia have over the invasion? Four. At yesterday’s emergency UN general assembly session, only Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea and Syria voted with Putin. 141 opposed and 35 abstained. Police in Moscow detained two women and five children who wanted to lay flowers at the Ukrainian embassy. Photographs of their detention showed the children holding a poster saying “No to war”. The children, aged seven to 11, were held with their mothers in a police van before being taken to a police station. They were released hours later, according to the anthropologist Alexandra Arkhipova. Meanwhile, Yelena Osipova, a 77-year-old artist and activist, was also marched away by a group of police while she protested against the war in St Petersburg. How many Russian protesters have been arrested? Almost 7,000 people since the invasion began, according to monitoring organisation OVD-Info. How is Russia’s economy being impacted? Analysts at Goldman Sachs downgraded Russia’s 2022 growth forecasts from a 2% climb to a 7% contraction. What about Russia’s global reputation? Russian and Belarusian athletes will be banned from the Beijing Winter Paralympics, the International Paralympic Committee announced this morning. The House select committee investigating the 6 January Capitol attack said Donald Trump violated multiple federal laws to overturn the 2020 election, including obstructing Congress and defrauding the United States. The former president knew he had not won enough electoral college votes to win the 2020 election, but sought the then-vice-president, Mike Pence, to manipulate the results in his favor, the filing said. Had the effort to pressure Pence into returning Trump to power succeeded, the certification of Joe Biden’s win would have been impeded. The select committee said it believed Trump defrauded the US by interfering in the certification process, disseminating false information about election fraud, and pressuring state officials to alter state election results. A Texas judge blocked the state from investigating the parents of a transgender teenager over gender-confirmation treatments yesterday, but stopped short of blocking other investigations. The lawsuit marked the first report of parents being investigated after the Republican governor Greg Abbott’s order that officials view such treatments as abuse. About 500,000 across New South Wales, Australia were under evacuation orders or warnings yesterday as wild weather battered the greater Sydney region. Emergency services received almost 12,000 requests for help since the start of the floods crisis. Marilyn Manson filed a lawsuit against Evan Rachel Wood for defamation over the actor’s sexual abuse allegations against him. The LA superior court complaint accuses Wood of depicting him as “a rapist and abuser” that has “derailed” Manson’s career. The Russian businessman Roman Abramovich confirms Chelsea soccer club is up for sale and writes off $2bn loans. Abramovich’s position had been under growing uncertainty since he announced plans to transfer stewardship to a charitable foundation on Saturday. German authorities have seized the $600m superyacht belonging to the Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov. Usmanov was on a list of billionaires to face sanctions from the European Union. The impact of the pandemic threatens to reverse decades of progress made towards gender equality, according to a study that reveals women have been hit much harder socially and economically than men. Research by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington found, among other things, the greatest and most persistent gender gap was seen in employment and uncompensated labour, with 26% of women reporting loss of work compared with 20% of men globally in September 2021. California is trying to get ahead of the problem, becoming the first US state to put in place a comprehensive plan for tackling microplastics. The roadmap of 22 actions is focused on preventing plastic particles from getting into the environment, intercepting plastics pollution and educating the public about the problem. But Katharine Gammon asks, will it be enough? “As I held him in the bunker, I said to him: ‘You’re lucky, you’re unique, you’re born in Ukraine, you’re a new Ukrainian’,” writes Viktoria about giving birth in a Kyiv bomb shelter. “Every morning now I wake up a bit earlier just to look at him sleep, he looks like a small angel. I also look out the window to see if the buildings have stayed in their places or if they’ve been ruined. I hope my son will experience this war only from stories – that he will never, never feel what it’s like in real life. I don’t want him to know real war.” “Throughout my early 20s, I spent a lot of time seeking to acquire knowledge about my body. It was unwell, this much was certain, and the question of how was one to which I applied myself studiously,” writes Will Rees in the Guardian long read. “The doctor placed a stethoscope on my back in order to listen to my lungs, placing his other hand against my chest to steady himself. His grip tightened, signifying something. He cleared his throat and composed himself. ‘Did you have any plans today, Mr Rees?’ He instructed me to go to the emergency room.” Bringing flowers into the kitchen – in a recipe, not a vase – is a way to add a touch of flavur, as well as a feast for your eyes, writes Emine Saner. The trend for edible flowers has been blooming for several years but, for many of us, the idea of munching petals, instead of admiring them, is still a leap. Edible flowers include lavender, roses, hollyhocks, pelargoniums, nasturtiums and pansies. Try it, you will find pumpkin soup is suddenly stunning when garnished with violas.

3/3/2022,"The London Stock Exchange has suspended trading in 27 companies with strong links to Russia, including energy and banking giants Gazprom and Sberbank. The LSE said it was moving to block trading in the companies, which also include EN+, Lukoil and Polyus, with immediate effect “in light of market conditions, and in order to maintain orderly markets”. International pressure is taking an increasing toll on Russian businesses, while the invasion of Ukraine is also disrupting those with operations in the region, with miners Evraz, in which Roman Abramovich owns a 29% stake, and Polymetal dropping out of the FTSE 100 in its quarterly review as their market values have plummeted. On Friday, the LSE suspended VTB Capital, a subsidiary of Russia’s second-largest bank VTB, from trading. Earlier this week, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) suspended trading in the bank’s global depository receipts on the LSE, where it has a secondary listing. Its main listing is in Moscow. On Wednesday, Sberbank, Russia’s biggest lender, announced it was pulling out of the European market, after it said it faced large outflows of cash in the region as well as threats to the safety of its employees and branches. The announcement came only hours after the European Central Bank ordered the closure of Sberbank Europe, warning that the business could fail following a run on deposits because of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The LSE, which said that its own operations in Russia and Ukraine account for less than 1% of total income, added that it would “continue to keep this situation under review”. LSE reported an almost doubling of pre-tax profits from £492m in pandemic-hit 2020 to £987m last year.

3/3/2022,"In a tattered cardboard box in Mateo Sobode Chiqueno’s home, hundreds of plastic cassette cases contain four decades of memories. “Here in my house, I have more than 1,000 cassettes of Ayoreo histories and songs,” says Chiqueno, who keeps them alongside his tape recorder at his wooden shack in Campo Loro, Paraguay. Many of the voices belong to people who are dead. Chiqueno began compiling his interviews with the Ayoreo, hunter-gatherers of the Chaco Forest, in 1979, after seeing missionaries using tape recorders to document their experiences. His tapes partially preserve a fast-disappearing culture. The Ayoreo were victims of Catholic and Evangelical missionaries of the 1940s who sought them out and brought them to settlements like Campo Loro. Since the 1980s, cattle ranchers have bulldozed and burned about a fifth of the Chaco and, today, the Ayoreo number about 5,000, with barely a dozen small family groups still living in the forest. “I’m an old man now. I don’t know how many more years I’ll live,” says Chiqueno, who was brought out of the forest as a child, both his parents dying soon afterwards. “The work will remain, in our future as Ayoreo … the work I’m doing is for our grandchildren, our children, so they can find the cassettes and all the messages of the Ayoreo who died many years ago.” Chiqueno’s lifelong project is now the subject of a film directed by Arami Ullón, Nothing but the Sun, which documents his gently probing conversations. It has won multiple awards, including best feature documentary at Canada’s Lunenburg Doc Fest, the documentary prize at Cinélatino Rencontres de Toulouse and been nominated for a prestigious IDA documentary award. It was Paraguay’s submission for this year’s Oscars (though it didn’t make the shortlist) and has been declared of national cultural, educational and historical interest by Paraguay’s senate. Speaking from her home in Switzerland, Ullón praises Chiqueno’s qualities as an interviewer, describing his emotional encounter with José, the Ayoreo man who captured Chiqueno and his family to take them to the missionaries. The conversation, she says, “is one full of respect and understanding” for how the Ayoreo differently responded to the “trauma of contact”. The tapes touch on subjects such as the Ayoreo worship of the sun, known as Yoquimamito, and how they climb trees to better hear him. They also contain vital ancestral knowledge, such as how the roots of the chicoi plant contain water – a godsend in drought, but now often inaccessible behind the barbed wire of private property. One elderly man, Tune, recalls how he and his wife first glimpsed white men on horseback and ran, terrified, in different directions through the undergrowth. “We never saw each other again,” he says. In another tape, a former shaman, who has since adopted Christianity after pressure from her daughters, sings about an encounter with a spirit who warned of future calamities for the Ayoreo. A recurring topic for Chiqueno is how Ayoreo families were often tricked or forced into leaving the forest. Revisiting this distressing period means overcoming the shame and silence enforced by their missionary captors. “It’s like it were a muzzle,” he says. The recordings are being digitised by Iniciativa Amotocodie, a Paraguayan conservation organisation, which works with the Ayoreo. “We’re about halfway there,” says Miguel Lovera, the NGO’s director. Some tapes have unravelled, but Lovera says: “It’s a long-distance race that we’re not going to abandon.” Meanwhile, international concern is growing for the fate of the Ayoreo. Last week, the first half of a new, 340-mile (550km) highway bisecting Ayoreo lands was inaugurated. The government says the road will supercharge the agribusiness sector, help integrate a remote area, and benefit local people. Critics fear it will hasten deforestation and further erode fragile native communities. A few days before the inauguration, 10 organisations representing thousands of indigenous people across Peru, Brazil, Ecuador and Colombia issued an appeal for Paraguay’s government and international bodies to prevent the “genocide” of the Ayoreo, who still live in the wild. “For years the Paraguayan authorities have stood by and watched as the Ayoreo’s priceless forest goes up in smoke,” says Teresa Mayo at Survival International. Paraguay’s government and business elite, Chiqueno says, should “respect the territory of the Ayoreo who are still in the forest and let them live how they want to live. Because they are human beings, too.” The suffering and illness endured in the mission settlements, captured in Chiqueno’s recordings, should serve as a warning. “They [the Ayoreo in the forest] live better than us,” he says. In the documentary, Chiqueno’s wife, Dojae Tona Picanere, says: “Some people don’t accept what you do.” Later on, however, she says: “But I like it because it comforts you.

3/3/2022,"Edinson Cavani is set to leave Manchester United when his contract expires this summer and the striker’s preferred option would be to join a club in Spain. The 35-year-old Uruguayan has played in Italy, France and England and wants to experience another of Europe’s major leagues. Cavani has received approaches, including from La Liga clubs. Cavani joined United from Paris Saint-Germain in October 2020 and signed a one-year contract extension last May after scoring 17 goals in his first season. He talked then about achieving “special things” this season but the campaign has not unfolded as he or the club hoped. United have been off the pace in domestic competitions – they remain in contention in the Champions League – and Cavani has been restricted by injuries to 15 appearances, scoring twice. He has not played for almost a month because of a groin strain.

3/3/2022,"There are two stories in this novel, but each one has been cut up, and the two sets of fragments shuffled together. They form a composite picture as frustrating, and as full of brilliant moments of illumination, as those church windows where conservators have reassembled the shards left behind by iconoclasts’ cudgels, making a collage of unrelated pieces. Here a saint’s hands reaching out in blessing; there the leering grimace of a snouted devil; a scattering of pieces of drapery lovingly executed; everywhere glimpses of sky, of dirt, of bright colour. Spanish author Elena Medel is a poet, and she has a poet’s preference for the significant moment over the sustained narrative. In her first novel, she gives us vignettes of two women, each of whom moves to Madrid in search of a new start. María is Alicia’s grandmother, but they don’t know each other. In the final section they will meet, unknowingly, during the 2018 women’s strike, only to pass on by. Their lives echo each other – both of them abandoning ambition, worn down by exhausting menial jobs, both making do emotionally with mediocre men – but they are also opposites. María is “un coeur simple” – undemanding, kind, patient. Alicia is spiteful, guarded, driven by contempt for others and for herself. María’s story is a feminist parable: blameless girl, seduced and exploited, eventually finds self-respect in middle age as the co-founder of a women’s group. Alicia’s story is darker – an overprivileged girl gets a horrific comeuppance and shuts down emotionally, choosing numbing work over anything that might reawaken her clever, angry mind, and refusing love in favour of promiscuous sex. Their interleaved stories are told in a variety of unreliable voices, and out of chronological order. We know that as an adult Alicia dreams every night about a suspended body, swaying horribly, long before we discover that her father hanged himself, and even longer before we hear that Alicia herself – newly arrived at secondary school – was hung up by an ankle from a roof beam in the gym by children who hated her for her arrogance. Time pleats and folds back on itself. We see both women putting up with their men’s weaknesses before we see them meeting those men. We learn only obliquely, and in jumbled order, the life story of the intermediate woman – Carmen, who is María’s daughter and Alicia’s mother, and has been left behind by them both. The effect of this fragmentation is to make of these individual women’s lives a collective picture of working-class Spanish womanhood. With light touches Medel conveys gradual but tremendous change. Alicia’s great uncle remembers when their neighbourhood in Córdoba had no sewers. Two women discuss office-cleaning jobs and voting for communism as they queue up to pee in a bar’s single toilet. The spread of Madrid’s public transport system is felt vividly, not from the city-planning point of view, but in the aching feet and backs of women travelling after a late shift, on buses that deposit them a long way from home, with a frightening walk still to be done along ill-lit streets with too many dark doorways. The book works best as a sequence of short stories. The passages when Medel carries us swiftly through the years become muzzy, but when she slows down and tightens her focus particular incidents shine out. The old woman María cares for wants to wear a special dress for her saint’s day. Their relationship is described with a delicate appreciation of its complexity – the pathos, the tedium, the tenderness and the exasperation. Finally buttoned into her red dress, the old woman dies. General Franco has died too, and is lying in state. Everyone has gone to see him; eventually María finds another servant to help her. The two women identify themselves by the names and addresses of their employers: “I’m Doña Sisi’s girl from the 3rd floor.” Entrusted with the management of life and death, they are still of too little account, even to themselves, to merit proper introduction. This is a book that evades glib summary. It is about poverty, but Alicia’s nature is distorted by being comparatively rich. It is about feminism, but the two most saintly characters are men: María’s brother Chico, bringing up the baby she cannot afford to keep, sacrificing his own hopes of college and a teaching career; her lover Pedro, spoiling his chances with her by being so steadily good to his helpless old parents and mentally ill brother. Like the society it describes, Medel’s novel is harsh. It is sometimes confusing. It lapses into generalisations about sexual politics or capitalism. But like that smashed and remade stained-glass window, it has a boldly ingenious structure and flashes of beauty.  Lucy Hughes-Hallett’s story collection Fabulous is published by 4th Estate.

3/3/2022,"Idon’t like co-operative gaming. I am too much of a control freak to let another player screw up my good work. But I really wanted to try It Takes Two because, first, it was in every single top games of 2021 list and, second, the game is about a couple on the verge of divorce who must find a way to work together. And a little over a year ago, my wife and I were in the same situation. In It Takes Two, the spouses become tiny dolls who must work their way through their suddenly gigantic house, solving puzzles to reunite with their weeping daughter. In real life, we did family therapy. Family therapy is great. Everyone sits in a room and says how bad their life is because of Dad. In our case, they were right. I had switched roles with my wife to become the worst stay-at-home parent ever. Stay-at-home parents are the ones who have to problem-solve. I am quick at solving problems but even quicker to get cross when people don’t accept the solution I offer. One therapist said it could be Asperger’s. Another said it was inherited Scottish Dad DNA: we like to shout problems into submission. Others closer to me suggested I was just arrogant. There is no grey area with me. Things are black or white, right or wrong. This is why I like platform games: there is only one solution. I remember playing Manic Miner at 10 years old, and I would just see the path and timing of jumps appear, like pure maths in A Beautiful Mind. But trying to explain that to someone else is a nightmare. Family therapy made me realise all this and made me a better person, I thought. What better way to prove that than by playing this game with Phoebe, a black belt at Crash Bandicoot? For me, the most challenging thing about the first couple of levels was the world’s most irritating character, a talking book. Don’t ask. For my wife, the only thing more irritating than this patronising, monologuing self-help guide was me. Early in the game a broken hammer asks for help because the wife in the game, May, has been neglecting the tools. “That’s the same problem as our marriage,” I chirped. “If only you’d pay more attention to my tool.” GamesMaster fans found my shtick hilarious on TV for six seasons in the 90s but my wife has had to suffer this childishness for 26 years. Cracks appear when the game morphs from a platformer into a homage to other video game genres. As good as my wife is at platform games, she cannot aim a gun. She has never played top-down RPGs such as Diablo, and crashes around like Leroy Jenkins while I sit back and calculate the best path. We started falling into old roles, with me barking things such as: “Three red rings. Beetle coming for you. One red. Hole filled with sap!” This was fine when Phoebe used her elite platform game skills to react accordingly but when that didn’t happen, the anger started to emerge. Anger is the fuel for all platformers. It’s the flipside to the joy. That one linear solution makes it the most frustrating of all game genres when your fingers don’t do what the brain tells them to. Especially if, in my wife’s case, that brain is 54 years old, has already done a full day’s proper job and would rather have a glass of wine and a bath. The levels got harder. She grew more tired. I grew more determined. “I need to go to bed, I’ve got to be at the shop for eight tomorrow morning,” she said. “But we need to complete this game so I can write about it!” I replied, a sheen of sweat on my face and the look of a zealot in my eyes. We reached a level inside a clock tower which required me to reverse time, so that platforms would appear and disappear while my wife jumped across them. She kept missing a particular leap. I ran the gamut of passive-aggressive sharp intakes of breath, then proceeded to tell her exactly what she should be doing. It only took one slip off a swinging rope to make me crack. The inside of my brain exploded like an open can of Irn-Bru thrown into a moving car. “Oh my giddy aunt, how am I ever going to show Guardian readers how great my marriage is if you keep messing up It Takes Two for me?” (NB. This is translated from the original Scottish Dad words.) I had reverted to the control freak I used to be. Because of a game. My wife gave me a look of utter disdain and left the room. I sat there for a while. Then I put the pad down, stood up, pulled the lead out of the back of the Xbox and went upstairs to apologise. As admirable as It Takes Two is in trying to show a version of marriage therapy, it doesn’t feature the truly horrible, heartbreaking, crushing-pressure stuff you have to deal with in real marriages: chronic child illnesses, job losses, emigration, addiction, mental health problems, making sure the kids have equally valuable Christmas gifts.

3/3/2022,"Russian forces are in control of the local government building in the Black Sea port of Kherson, according to its mayor, Igor Kolykhaiev, although there are conflicting reports about the status of the strategically important city. More heavy explosions were reported in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and second city, Kharkiv, overnight and on Thursday morning after Russian missile strikes. A second round of talks is reportedly set to take place today. A Russian negotiator said a ceasefire was on the agenda, but Ukraine has said Russia must stop bombing Ukrainian cities before any progress can be made. More than one million people have fled Ukraine since Russian forces invaded the country last week, the head of the United Nations refugee agency has said. The international criminal court (ICC) is opening an investigation into possible war crimes in Ukraine and has begun collecting evidence after 38 countries formally referred reports of atrocities, the largest referral it has ever received. The Russian advance on Kyiv has been delayed by “staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion” and is still more than 30km from the centre of the city, Britain’s defence ministry said. The UN nuclear watchdog has voiced concern after Russian forces claimed to have surrounded Ukraine’s biggest atomic plant and called for its workers to be left alone to do their jobs. The strategically important Sea of Azov port city of Mariupol is reportedly surrounded by Russian troops. Police in Moscow detained two women and five children holding a poster outside the Ukraine embassy that said “No to war”. More than 350 Ukrainian civilians have been killed and more than 2,000 injured, according to Ukraine’s emergency service. Transport facilities, hospitals, kindergartens and homes have been destroyed, it said. Ukraine claimed nearly 7,000 Russian troops had been killed in the first six days of Moscow’s invasion. Moscow said 498 Russian soldiers had died in Ukraine since the start of its campaign, its first statement on casualties. The UN general assembly voted overwhelmingly to deplore Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and called for the immediate withdrawal of its forces, with 141 of the 193 member states voting for the resolution on Wednesday. The US has accused Russia of launching a “full war on media freedom and the truth” by blocking independent news outlets and preventing Russians from hearing news of the invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s central bank has imposed a 30% commission on foreign currency purchases by individuals on currency exchanges. Russian and Belarusian athletes have been banned from the Winter Paralympic Games for their countries’ roles in the conflict, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) said, in a reversal of its previous stance.

3/3/2022,"Furious rank and file members of the New South Wales Liberal party are marshalling against federal intervention to override branch preselections and impose candidates in eight prize federal seats, a move that will almost certainly see the party plunged into legal action. “They’ve carpet bombed the entire division” said one member of the NSW state executive. “It’s disgusting.” The federal executive is due to meet on Friday morning when it is expected to endorse candidates for Warringah, Hughes, Dobell, Parramatta, Greenway and Eden-Monaro as well as re-endorsing three sitting MPs: Sussan Ley in Farrer, Alex Hawke in Mitchell and Trent Zimmerman in North Sydney. Under the NSW Liberal party’s constitution, candidates are now to be chosen by plebiscites in which all branch members can participate. The federal executive is expected use its powers of intervention to direct the NSW branch to endorse the candidates, though it could take over the functions of the branch entirely. The flashpoint for anger within the party is a deal that was stitched together by factional heavyweights and put to the state executive on Wednesday. The motion was rejected 16 to 6, with two people not voting, but that was sufficient to block the use of special powers which require 90% support. The motion specifically said it had the support of prime minister Scott Morrison, NSW premier Dominic Perrottet and the federal president of the party, John Olsen. The deal would install disability campaigner and moderate Liberal David Brady as the candidate for Warringah over the conservative Lincoln Parker, as well as management consultant Alex Dore in the seat of Hughes over state MP Melanie Gibbons. Dore does not live in Hughes and has not nominated, but is a former Young Liberal president whose uncle is the editor in chief of the Australian newspaper. Brady had nominated for the Senate but had not nominated for Warringah. The proposal also installs others into seats without branch plebiscites. The new, more democratic approach for choosing candidates in NSW was introduced into the NSW Liberal constitution in 2018. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A branch president in Tony Abbott’s former electorate of Warringah, Walter Villatora, emailed party officials vowing “a civil war in the party that will go far beyond Warringah and could derail the Morrison government’s already fragile electoral prospects”. “Warringah is the home of the democratic reform movement. And yet you are proposing to breach the party’s constitution and install a person who’s first contact with the conference will be on the basis of breaching the rules in contempt of the membership from which he will be seeking support,” Villatora said. “If this happens, the Warringah Liberal members will revolt and simply walk away,” he warned. “There will be no grassroots or donor support for an illegitimately appointed, unknown outsider. To beat the incumbent Independent [Zali Steggall] the party needs all the resources and support it can get.’” State executive member Matthew Camenzuli, has again engaged barrister Scott Robertson SC for advice about a legal challenge to the intervention, which is expected. Camenzuli successfully challenged the party’s legal advice on a separate but related matter in the supreme court earlier this week. At least two unsuccessful nominees who had hoped to go before a branch preselection are also considering legal action. A last ditch proposal to get state executive to consider branch plebiscites conducted on a truncated timetable has been stalled after the state president, Philip Ruddock, declined to circulate it to state executive. “Captains’ picks are not democracy”, NSW senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells wrote to NSW Liberal members on Wednesday night. “It is entirely unclear as to who has decided to anoint these certain candidates and by-pass the normal pre-selection process where YOU have a say,” she wrote. “What is clear is that it proposes to deny any competitive pre-selections, in circumstances where in some cases (such as Mitchell and Dobell) nominations closed more than 10 months ago,” she said.",News/Australia news,‘It’s disgusting’: NSW Liberal members irate over federal imposition of candidates in prize seats,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/03/its-disgusting-nsw-liberal-members-irate-over-federal-imposition-of-candidates-in-prize-seats
3/3/2022,"The last thing Krystle Henry and Matt Bridges thought they would be dealing with in the hours before the birth of their son was a complex logistical problem caused by catastrophic flooding across the state of Queensland. Roughly 24 hours before a scheduled caesarean at Brisbane’s Mater Mothers’ hospital, the family had woken up on Monday to find themselves cut off by flood waters. Though their two-year-old daughter had been thrilled at the unfolding crisis, Bridges said the water came as a shock. “The floods really snuck up on us,” he said. “There was heavy rain on Saturday night, then we went to get coffee – our last as a family of three – on Sunday morning. “We went to the bottom of the road and it was cut off. On both ends.” At first, Bridges wasn’t worried. Parts of Brisbane are prone to flash flooding but the water usually recedes when the rain eases. But on Monday the rain hadn’t eased, the water was higher and news reports made clear a catastrophe was unfolding across the state. Henry’s obstetrician suggested she head into the hospital a day early to make sure she safely made her appointment, good advice which was unfortunately easier said than done. Bridges called the State Emergency Services and the family was put on a rescue list, but were a low priority as no one’s life was immediately at risk. With emergency rescue teams spread thin, the couple hatched a plan to make their appointment. The first step involved coordinating with Bridges’ dad, who was in Brisbane. He was tasked with renting a car to get as close to Taringa – a suburb 6.8km south-west of the city – as possible. Then the question became how Henry would get to Bridges’ dad. Swimming or walking through the dirty flood water wasn’t option for the expectant mother. Driving into flood water is extremely dangerous and neither was it possible for her to climb fences. The safest option was to paddle out. When Bridges put the word out among neighbours for anyone with a boat or a watercraft to help, everyone on their block began to pull together to organise Henry a ride, and someone to look after the couple’s daughter while they sorted things out. “One of our neighbours have older grandkids, so they have toys they don’t play with any more,” Bridges said. “When we dropped my daughter at our neighbour’s place, she didn’t look at us. [She] threw up a hand, said ‘bye’ and ran off to play with the toys. She wasn’t nearly as worried as mum and dad were.” Meanwhile, one neighbour, Clare, had found another neighbour, Rob, with a motorised kayak. “I saved his name in my phone as ‘Rob Kayak’ and he saved my name as ‘Matt Pregnant’, Bridges said. “It’s amazing. All he said is he was just happy to help out.” Loaded into the kayak, Henry was ferried off to meet Rob’s dad two streets away, who then took her by car to her appointment. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Later that evening, Bridges’ mum was able to come in to look after the couple’s daughter so he could join Henry at the hospital Monday evening – this time by jumping three fences – and be there for the birth of their son on Tuesday morning. While they considered alternative names such as “Royce”, the couple decided to name their son Angus. With several lives lost and people having everything they own destroyed in the floods, Bridges said the couple are deeply grateful for the kindness of their community which made their “little adventure” go without complication. “You get these baby books that you document milestones in,” Bridges said. “For the birth story, they only give you two lines.” “Krystle was joking saying we were going to need a few more lines on that book.”",News/Australia news,Woman gives birth after being rescued from Brisbane floods by neighbours and a kayak,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/03/woman-gives-birth-after-being-rescued-from-brisbane-floods-by-neighbours-and-a-kayak
3/3/2022,"The flood disaster in New South Wales and Queensland has prompted concerns for ground-dwelling animals that can become trapped in their habitat or swept into other environments. Wildlife hospitals are preparing for an influx of sick and injured animals, in some cases from habitats that have been hit by flood waters for the second year in a row. Echidnas, wombats and bandicoots are among the species that can become trapped by flood waters and the sustained rain can also create havoc for birds that struggle for shelter and become waterlogged. This time of year in northern NSW, echidna puggles are in their burrows and not yet ready to disperse, meaning many would have drowned, Leoni Byron-Jackson, the coordinator of Wires in Lismore, said. There had also been reports of drowned or injured bandicoots and wallaby joeys. Byron-Jackson said it would be weeks until carers had a clear picture of the effects of the devastation on local wildlife. “At the moment it’s really hard because there’s so many roads blocked off, so many landslides, that we can’t even get access to those animals, which is distressing us all,” she said. “We are doing our best to reach every animal we can or get them to vets, but the other problem is we’ve lost half our vets, they’re under water.” Byron-Jackson said while many mammals were capable of swimming they still needed to be able to find higher ground. She said services were working hard to connect sick animals with carers but that was being made more difficult with communication lines down for many. “We’ve got a little [puggle] we’re trying to transfer to me today, one that’s come out of a burrow too early and was found starving,” she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In Sydney, Taronga Wildlife Hospitals said it had enacted its emergency response plan to assist sick and injured wildlife, with staff working with other services and teams in the field as needed. “Heavy rainfall and storm events impact all wildlife, but are particularly challenging for birds, small mammals and young or dispersing animals,” said Libby Hall, Taronga’s wildlife rescue and rehabilitation coordinator. She said birds could be adversely affected by high winds, lowered food resources, lack of shelter and were often found cold and waterlogged, while small mammals and monotremes such as bandicoots, possums and echidnas were also vulnerable, with younger animals at increased risk. “As immediate flooding abates, wildlife in freshwater river systems such as platypus will also be vulnerable and may be in need of assistance,” she said. Hall said anyone who found injured animals should not offer them any food because this can lead to unintended harm. She said people should prioritise their own safety before approaching animals and if it was safe to offer assistance to do so with care and, if possible, protective clothing. They should then seek expert assistance from a wildlife service and if it was not possible to immediately get the animal to a hospital or carer they should keep it in a warm, quiet and dark place off the floor at home.

Ritchie said the effects of floods could be seen not just in sick or drowned animals but also in animals being moved by flood waters into areas outside of their regular habitats. “In terms of the impact, it may be less in some ways than fire because a fire in many respects can destroy all the habitat and it can take a while to recover,” he said. “In the case of flood, it’s relatively quick and if the animals can survive that flood they can repopulate an area fairly quickly.” The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on Monday issued the second part of its latest major assessment, which came with a stark warning about the increased frequency and intensity of natural disasters as a result of emissions caused by fossil fuels and other human activities. “What is concerning is that these extreme weather events, including floods, are becoming more frequent and severe with climate change,” Ritchie said. “If these floods happen more regularly, and to an extent that plants, animals and ecosystems aren’t used to, that is a problem.” For further information on how to assist sick or injured wildlife, Taronga Conservation Society has put together a list of rescue tips.",News/Australia news,‘We are doing our best’: rescuers fear for animals injured in NSW and Queensland floods,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/03/we-are-doing-our-best-rescuers-fear-for-animals-injured-in-nsw-and-queensland-floods
3/3/2022,"The Australian government has asked Facebook, Twitter, Google and other digital platforms to block content generated by Russian state media to curb “disinformation in relation to the Russian invasion of Ukraine”. Australia’s communications minister, Paul Fletcher, wrote on Thursday to Meta, which runs Facebook and Instagram, and a range of other digital platforms, asking them to take action “as a priority to suspend the dissemination on your platform[s] in Australia of content generated by Russian state media organisations”. The other recipients are Apple, TikTok, Twitter, Snap Inc, Reddit, Google and Microsoft. Fletcher cited “a significant volume of such content promoting violence, extremism and disinformation in relation to the Russian invasion of Ukraine”. Australia is not the first government to make the request, with the European Union’s own ban on Russian state media prompting a number of platforms to crack down on Kremlin-backed news outlets RT and Sputnik. “In light of the exceptional circumstances that are unfolding in Ukraine, and in the interests of protecting sovereignty and territorial integrity, the Australian government asks that [your platform] takes such action in respect of content disseminated on your platform[s] in Australia,” Fletcher wrote on Thursday. “I would be grateful to receive your early advice as to the steps you have taken to achieve this outcome.” Fletcher noted that a number of platforms had taken action to block such services and content in the United States and Europe. He also pointed to the recent decisions by Australia’s Special Broadcasting Service and Foxtel to suspended the broadcast of Russia Today and NTV. “Given the current actions of the Russian government, and the lack of genuinely independent Russian media, these actions are responsible and appropriate,” the Australian minister wrote. Meta said the company was “reviewing the request from the Australian government”. “In the meantime, we will continue to label and fact check these outlets as well as prohibit ads and demonetize their accounts globally, including in Australia,” a spokesperson said. It is understood Meta wrote to Fletcher on Wednesday outlining the steps it was taking and offering to set up a meeting to discuss any concerns, but no such meeting was requested. Snap said on Wednesday its Discover content platform featured material from only verified media partners and creators “and we have never allowed Russian state media to distribute content”. Earlier this week, Google said it was blocking YouTube channels connected to RT and Sputnik across Europe. Google also said it had “removed hundreds of channels and thousands of videos” for violating community guidelines “including a number of channels engaging in coordinated deceptive practices”. The Russian embassy in Canberra was also contacted for comment. Earlier, the US state department accused the Kremlin of “a full assault on media freedom and the truth”, after Russia’s prosecutor general ordered the country’s communications authority to restrict access to the independent outlets Radio Ekho Moskvy and Dozhd TV. The Duma – Russia’s parliament – is scheduled to meet on Friday to debate a new law against “spreading disinformation about the armed forces of the Russian Federation in any military conflicts”, punishable by up to 15 years in prison. The Kremlin has attempted to defend what it calls a “special military operation” to “demilitarise” Ukraine, launched last week. Russia’s media regulator has already banned the use of the words “war”, “attack” and “invasion”. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said on Sunday that RT and Sputnik would “no longer be able to spread their lies to justify [Vladimir] Putin’s war and to sow division in our union”. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, had earlier branded Putin as “a thug” and called for Russia to be treated as a pariah state over the invasion. Australia was one of 141 states to vote in favour of a resolution deploring Russia’s actions at a special session of the UN general assembly late on Wednesday. Russia was joined by only four other countries – Belarus, Syria, North Korea and Eritrea – in voting against the condemnation. China and India were among 35 states to abstain. Separately, nearly 40 countries including Australia and the UK have formally referred reports of atrocities committed in Ukraine to the international criminal court (ICC). The ICC prosecutor announced on Thursday he was launching an investigation into “any past and present allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide committed on any part of the territory of Ukraine by any person”. Ukraine’s emergency services report that more than 350 Ukrainian civilians have been killed and more than 2,000 injured, while hundreds of structures including transport facilities, hospitals, kindergartens and homes have been destroyed. The UN refugee agency estimates more than 1 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia’s invasion last week. Australia has participated in expanding rounds of international sanctions against Russia and has committed $70m to provide Ukraine with missiles and ammunition. On Wednesday, a Royal Australian Air Force Globemaster III loaded with “critical military equipment and medical supplies” left the Richmond base, northwest of Sydney, bound for Europe. Amid heightened tensions, the area outside the Russia embassy in Canberra was cordoned off for more than five hours on Thursday as police investigated the posting of suspicious packages to the diplomatic mission. Australian Capital Territory Policing said the contents of one of the packages were found to be safe, but the contents of a second package required “further analysis”. The Australian National University said on Thursday it was “suspending all ties and activities with Russian institutions, indefinitely and with immediate effect”. The ANU said it stood “in solidarity with the Ukrainian people in their defence of sovereignty and freedom” and urged institutions across Australia to condemn Putin’s “unprovoked aggression”.",News/World news,"Morrison government asks Facebook, Twitter and Google to block Russian state media ‘disinformation’",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/03/morrison-government-asks-facebook-twitter-and-google-to-block-russian-state-media-disinformation
3/3/2022,"The Premier League is considering adding a human rights component to its owners’ and directors’ test as it conducts a review of the controversial regulation. The review is part of a wide-ranging reassessment of the league’s governance and comes as pressure again grows to expand the criteria by which it assesses prospective owners. League officials were keen to play down the significance of the review, suggesting it was normal practice and that the consideration of human rights was one of many issues being looked at. Any changes would need to be approved by at least 14 of the league’s 20 clubs. However, the league acknowledges it needs owners who benefit the competition during a period of greater scrutiny from the public and politicians. On Wednesday the leader of the Labour party, Sir Keir Starmer, called for sanctions to be applied against the Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Abramovich, who has put Chelsea up for sale, has vehemently disputed reports suggesting his alleged closeness to Vladimir Putin and Russia or that he has done anything to merit being sanctioned. Gary Neville, the Salford City co-owner and campaigner for reform in football, who in January joined the Labour party, said the situation involving Abramovich showed the need for a reinforced owners’ test. “Do I think [Abramovich] should be kicked out of English football? I’m not there yet but I do think we need a robust fit-and-proper owners’ test,” he told the Financial Times Business of Football Summit. “It needs to be more robust and resilient. We also need more transparency.” Last year the takeover of Newcastle United by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund was met with protest by supporters and human rights groups and the government’s fan-led review, led by Tracey Crouch MP, called for an enhanced owners’ and directors’ test when published in November. One condition proposed by Crouch would assess a candidate’s integrity, or whether “the proposed owner is of good character such that they should be allowed to be the custodian of an important community asset”. The fan-led review was welcomed by the government and there remains expectation that a bill to turn its recommendations into law, including the creation of an independent regulator for the game, will form part of the Queen’s speech later this year. The Premier League remains in regular discussions with government over possible legislation. The league has held two meetings with Amnesty International in recent months to discuss Amnesty’s suggestion of a fully human-rights compliant owners’ test. The Amnesty test called, among other things, for the Premier League board to consider whether a prospective owner or director had been complicit in serious violations of international human rights law or any conduct at odds with the league’s anti-discrimination policy.",Sport/Football,Premier League considers adding human rights to new owners’ test,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/03/premier-league-considers-adding-human-rights-to-new-owners-test
3/3/2022,"A Kuwaiti princess seeking asylum in Bosnia-Herzegovina has claimed the Kuwaiti state is using an Interpol red notice to intimidate and harass her and force the extradition of her partner, a prominent dissident blogger, back to the country. Sheikha Moneera Fahad al-Sabah and Mesaed al-Mesaileem, said they face torture and threats to their lives if they are returned to Kuwait due to their political activism. Kuwait has secured an Interpol red notice for Mesaileem – which acts as an international arrest warrant – and which the couple’s lawyer claims has likely been issued under false pretences. “States with poor human rights records are increasingly requesting extradition on the basis of political grounds,” said Alexis Thiry, legal adviser at Mena Rights Group, a Switzerland-based NGO that is providing legal representation to Mesaileem. “This is a very concerning development from a human rights perspective because such practice undermines the principle of non-refoulement, a rule of international customary law.” Non-refoulement is the fundamental principle underpinning international refugee law, that maintains that a person requiring protection cannot be forcibly returned to a place where they will face harm. The UN human rights council has said it is “deeply concerned” by the risk of Mesaileem’s extradition back to Kuwait. Both Sabah and Mesaileem have been publicly critical of the Kuwait state on social media, with Sabah alleging corruption in Kuwait’s ruling family. Sabah’s great uncle is Kuwait’s ruler, Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, who came to power in September 2020. She is the granddaughter of Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, the previous Kuwaiti emir. Sabah told the Guardian she had received multiple threats to her safety from her family and other powerful figures in Kuwait. “They’re going to kill me. They’ve raised some [legal] cases in Kuwait against me for assaulting the being of the royal family,” said Sabah, 35, who said she was imprisoned by her father for nearly a year. “When I first started speaking about corruption, they accused me of being mentally ill, and said I need to be in an institute. So, I’m scared they will lock me up, take my phones away, not let me speak because I have a lot of secrets.” The couple, who moved to Bosnia in 2020, have both surrendered their passports and been issued with yellow asylum seeker cards by the UN high commissioner for refugees. However, their asylum claim has not been granted by the Bosnian government, leaving them in legal limbo with the threat that deportation could happen at any time. The couple claim that men identifying themselves as Interpol officers raided their home in April 2020, saying they were acting on a red notice issued two years previously on charges relating to possession of weapons. However, Mena Rights Group argues that the basis of the red notice is false, and that it is being used to bring Mesaileem back to Kuwait to face political charges. Mesaileem has been sentenced multiple times in Kuwait on charges linked to freedom of expression, including using his mobile phone to organise demonstrations and insulting the emir on social media. In total, Kuwaiti courts have sentenced Mesaileem in absentia to 87 years in prison for his political activities, according to a UN special procedures letter. He has already spent periods in detention, where he claims he was mistreated. Concerns about abuses of Interpol notices by authoritarian regimes to snare dissidents have grown since Maj Gen Ahmed Naser al-Raisi, a leading security official from the United Arab Emirates, was elected to its presidency in November. Sabah and Mesaileem said they fear that pressure from the Kuwaiti state will see them deported and have called for Mesaileem to be removed from the Interpol red notice list. When contacted for comment, an Interpol spokesperson said the decisions over arrests and extraditions are the responsibility of each of its member states’ domestic authorities, known as National Central Bureaus (NCBs). “Red notices are requests to law enforcement worldwide to locate and, in accordance with national laws, provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action,” the spokesperson said. “Interpol’s General Secretariat cannot instruct NCBs on whether to arrest an individual or refrain from doing so, or whether to engage in extradition proceedings, etc. Such decisions are exclusively within the discretion of the competent national authorities of member countries.” The Bosnian and Kuwaiti authorities were approached for comment.",News/Global development,Interpol arrest warrant allegedly targeting Kuwaiti princess and partner ‘on political grounds’,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/03/interpol-arrest-warrant-allegedly-targeting-kuwaiti-princess-and-partner-on-political-grounds
3/3/2022,"As soon as the curfew was lifted in Kyiv, I drove around to understand what had happened to our capital overnight. For two full days residents had not been allowed to go out, even during the daytime. Russian saboteur groups were identified, and random street fights took place. I did not recognise my city, with checkpoints in the old town, with people digging trenches, bridges being fortified and the subway turned into a bomb shelter. A huge crowd, up to 500 people, lined up to volunteer for the territorial defence unit in one of the neighbourhoods. “Do you enrol everybody who shows up?” we asked a young guy in charge. “Almost all, but I do not accept those under 18,” he said. “And there are a lot of them. I wouldn’t be able to look their mothers in the eyes. I fought in 2014-2015 in Donbas, so I know what the war is.” It’s a predominantly male group but there are three women. The youngest is a lawyer. “What Russia has already done to the civilians has made us act,” she said. She had not told her family of her decision to fight. They live in a small town on the Ukrainian-Russian border, which has been partially destroyed. Another woman, in her 60s, said she was a nurse. Her husband had joined the defence units and she felt she needed to be with him. The last was a retired officer. She enrolled because her son had already joined the Ukrainian army. “When our grandparents, who remember the second world war, were wishing for peace, we didn’t understand why, she said, but now I know.” The figures say one thing, experience another. The official toll of civilian deaths is 350, but after seven days’ fighting, there cannot be a single Ukrainian who doesn’t know somebody who has been touched by tragedy. There are more than 1600 wounded. “That’s my classmate,” one colleague wrote, on seeing the front page of the Guardian, with a photo showing a woman wounded by shrapnel during the first attacks in Chuguev, on the eastern border. Elena Kurilova is not well. She can’t see with her left eye, and it’s getting worse. Her daughter, whose Instagram account looks like that of a beauty blogger, now livestreams with her mother in bandages to prove to Russian commentators that the injuries are real; her mother is not a fake. One of the flats destroyed belongs to a colleague in Kyiv. It was hit by a rocket and she circulates the pictures, but first she complains how unfair it is that Russian media have used pictures of her flat to accuse Ukraine of bombing its own people. “Those of you who have come to ‘rescue us’, just go away,” cries a woman holding a baby at Kyiv’s main station. “We were all right before you came. Just leave. All I have is some cash and a backpack.” Like thousands of people here, her mission is to go somewhere else, anywhere. The Ukrainian railway allows everybody to ride without tickets, including foreign citizens, and is running extra trains to the west. We count the hours: seven, 20, 70, 100, 144: hours of the Ukrainian army on its own, its citizens holding off one of the mightiest armies in the world, which is now being bolstered by support from Belarus. The count become symbolic. For those under bombardment, each hour seems like a year. The primary Russian target is the capital, and that army has been struggling to take it, but the fight is also a fierce one in many small towns whose names are never mentioned in the headlines. Irpin, Hostomel, Bucha were all attacked, but not captured. In Vasylkiv, on the Stuhna river, the college where IT specialists, construction workers, chefs and barbers study and train has been destroyed. Luckily 18 people who were staying in the college’s dorm were evacuated. The director of the college, Liudmyla Postolenko, walks through the debris, showing a damaged hall that had only recently been renovated. “Thank God, all are alive,” she says. “But our hearts are broken. Our kids are crying … But, you know, among our students there are construction workers, welders – so we will rebuild. What we need to do is care, and support those who are fighting.” Two weeks before the invasion, when things were still calm, I travelled to a town in Donbas and met a friend: a humanitarian worker from Kyiv, who had moved there after the start of the fighting. He took a day to walk around the city “to say goodbye to the last peaceful days”. He was confident, as were many, that the Ukrainian army, which managed to defend and take over towns in the area eight years ago, was in better shape. Still, while walking in a chilly but tranquil industrial town, he took pictures to remember. With every shot I felt more anger. I didn’t want to accept the notion of saying goodbye to peace. Driving through Kyiv, I film the queues outside the pharmacies and shops. The scenes in heavily shelled areas are surreal. The post office window has been broken for four days but no one has looted it. The computers and parcels are all perfectly in place. I film the billboards above the roads. They’re written in Russian, saying: “Russian soldier, stop! How can you look into your kids’ eyes? Remain human”; “Russian soldier, stop! Do not kill your soul for Putin’s oligarchs. Leave without blood on your hands.” There are details of the deal being offered by Ukraine’s defence minister to Russian conscripts: 5m roubles for anybody prepared to lay down their arms. I take photos of random buildings: Kyiv zoo, the opera house, my former office. The next day, they may not be there. For months before Putin’s air force attacked Ukraine, I was being asked by those abroad why Ukrainians were not panicking. I said we were not scared and that the source of our confidence was a belief that we could prove to Russia that in the long run we were unconquerable. And in the first days of the invasion, when civilians were killed by airstrikes that mainly missed their targets, it seemed clear that the Kremlin blitzkrieg was not working. But the cruise missiles that killed people in Freedom Square in Kharkiv, in the north-east, in the hospitals in Zhytomyr in the west, and in the residential areas in Mariupol in the south, showed us that the strategy has changed: now the plan is to terrify Ukrainians into submission. And this is just the beginning. Looking at the courage, unity, support and the heroics of our troops, 90% of Ukrainians believe Ukraine will win. The question is the price. Seven days were enough to get used to sirens and bomb shelters; a new reality in which I did not walk outside without a flak jacket. In a few days we might need to get used to life without electricity or running water. Ukrainians are ready for that. But the loss of all the lives feel different. These are losses that could and should have been prevented. They are something neither we or the outside world should get used to.

3/3/2022,"It took just eight days, and a war, for the International Olympic Committee to pull off an audacious mid-air manoeuvre that would not have been out of place on the slopes of the Winter Olympics. For much of February, as Beijing hosted the 2022 Games, the IOC was insistent: there is no place for politics in sport. “With regards to the Uyghur population, the position of the IOC must be to give political neutrality,” said the president, Thomas Bach, in early February. Yet just a week after the curtain fell on the Winter Olympics, the IOC radically backflipped. “In order to protect the integrity of global sports competitions and for the safety of all the participants,” the IOC executive board resolved on Monday, Russian and Belarusian athletes should be excluded from international competition. “The IOC reaffirms the call of the IOC president,” the statement continued. “Give peace a chance.” All of which begs the question: why are crimes against the Uyghur people and human rights violations in China just fine, but invading Ukraine beyond the pale? After a Winter Olympics replete with resort to neutrality, this blatant hypocrisy provokes a certain feeling of whiplash. Through this inexplicable sporting lens, it seems as if some atrocities are OK, but Russia crossed the line by marching on Kyiv. The IOC has at last done the right thing. Given the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, Russian participation in international sporting competitions would be unthinkable right now. Fifa, too, deserves some credit for excluding Russian teams from international competitions. The human cost is regrettable – ordinary Russian athletes, many of whom have no links to President Vladimir Putin’s regime and play no part in this current insanity. Yet a sporting ban on Russia is the only reasonable course of action as missiles rain down on Ukrainian civilians. But what took these sporting bodies so long? Russia invaded Georgia in 2008, a year after the IOC had awarded the 2014 Games to Sochi. Curiously, given recent events, the IOC was mute at the time. Six years later, on the day of the Winter Olympics closing ceremony, Russia’s annexation of Crimea began. In the following months, Russia invaded eastern Ukraine. Rather than condemning the violence, the Olympic governing body dished out honours to Putin loyalists (which, on Monday, they laughably clawed back). Fifa followed with the men’s World Cup, in 2018, notwithstanding Russia’s continuing occupation of Crimea, its proxy separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk and, just months before the tournament, a botched assassination attempt on English soil. Sportswashing has consequences – events in Ukraine over the past week have made that abundantly clear. By allowing their crown jewels to be used to burnish Russia’s image, the IOC and Fifa have been complicit in Putin’s wanton acts over the past decade. No doubt it is possible that, even if the 2014 Olympics or 2018 World Cup had been scrapped, we may still be where we are today. But the IOC and Fifa’s inaction hardly helped. When they should have acted, the governing bodies lacked the conviction to make hard choices. It is easy now for both to speak out; they have had their sporting jamborees – funded by the Russian taxpayer, enriching Russian oligarchs – and gone home. It is safe to condemn Putin today, from their Swiss palaces, with nothing on the line. By their latest actions, the IOC and Fifa have shown themselves to be nothing but opportunistic: neutral when it suits their commercial ambitions and political when they feel the need to swing in line with global opinion. With the Qatar 2022 World Cup later this year, the change of heart is unlikely to last. The tournament will go ahead using infrastructure quite likely built on the back of forced labour, in a nation ranked as “not free” by rights watchdog Freedom House, where the rights of women and LGBTQI+ Qataris are limited. Russia might not be there, but nor will the 6,500 migrant workers who have died in Qatar since the World Cup was awarded. Fifa’s culpability runs deep. Sport has always been political, dating right back to the first Olympiads of ancient Greece, when city states jostled, occasionally even resorting to violence, for the influence that came with hosting the Games. Insisting otherwise, as the IOC, Fifa and other global sporting bodies have long done, shows wilful disregard for reality. Yet they persisted with the myth, including just a week ago, when the latest Olympic circus ended in Beijing with barely a squeak about human rights. Their Russia ban is welcome, if cynical. But it only underscores their tremendous duplicity, their failure of leadership and the moral vacuum that sees the brutal repression of the Uyghur people, the Tibetans, the Hongkongers as warranting no more than “political neutrality”.

3/3/2022,"Australia’s second-biggest superannuation fund, the $230bn Australian Retirement Trust, has joined the wave of investors fleeing Russia after the invasion of Ukraine. The fund, which has about 2 million members and was formed on Monday through the merger of Sunsuper and QSuper, said it gave instructions to sell its Russian shares “earlier this week”. The Morrison government said on Thursday it had a “strong expectation” that Australian super funds would divest from Russia. Russia was on Thursday kicked out of a key index that fund managers use to guide their investments after index provider MSCI said the country’s market was “uninvestable”. Australia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Future Fund, as well as the New South Wales government and big super funds Aware, Rest and Cbus have all pledged to divest from Russia as soon as possible. “The government welcomes the voluntary actions taken to date by some superannuation funds to divest their Russian assets,” the federal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, and the minister for superannuation, Jane Hume, said in a joint statement. “While Australian superannuation funds only have a small exposure to Russian investments in the context of the $3.5tn superannuation system, it is important that Australia sends a clear and unequivocal signal that we condemn in the strongest possible terms Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine.” The statement poured additional political pressure on Australia’s biggest fund, AustralianSuper, which has been criticised by activist investors for refusing to disclose what it intends to do with hundreds of millions of dollars in Russian assets. The Australian government on Wednesday slapped sanctions on Russia’s central bank, making it impossible for it to increase its holding of about $8bn worth of Australian government bonds. Frydenberg has said the government will continue to pay interest on the bonds. A government source said the payments would be made to European clearing house Euroclear, but would not travel on to the Russian central bank due to sanctions in Europe. ART’s chief investment officer, Ian Patrick, said the fund had “instructed its investment managers earlier this week to sell any remaining debt and equity investments and not to make any new investments in either Russia, Ukraine, or Belarus, which has now entered the conflict alongside Russia”. “In some cases, this may prove challenging, given that some key markets remain closed or difficult to access.” The Moscow stock exchange has been closed since Monday and Ukrainian media reports it will remain closed on Thursday. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Patrick said QSuper and Sunsuper’s investments in Russia “were very limited prior to the onset of the crisis”. Sunsuper had less than 0.2% of members’ funds invested in Russian stocks and less than 0.1% in Russian bonds, while QSuper had no Russian investments at all, he said. The removal of Russia from MSCI’s emerging market indexes is likely to force the hand of some fund managers who have so far held back from dumping shares in the country’s companies from their portfolios. In a statement, MSCI said the decision followed consultation with institutional investors and will take effect from next Wednesday. “During the consultation, MSCI received feedback from a large number of global market participants, including asset owners, asset managers, broker dealers, and exchanges with an overwhelming majority confirming that the Russian equity market is currently uninvestable and that Russian securities should be removed from the MSCI Emerging Markets Indexes,” MSCI said in a statement. “Consultation participants highlighted several recent negative developments that led to a material deterioration in the accessibility of the Russian equity market to international institutional investors,” it said. AustralianSuper again declined to comment on its Russian holdings on Thursday. The fund’s public disclosures reveal it had a portfolio of Russian investments, including shares in Russia’s biggest bank, Sberbank, that before last week was valued at more than $300m. However, shares in Sberbank, which were valued by Aussie at almost $140m, have now become close to worthless after sanctions wiped out the company’s European business. It is believed that by the end of last week the fund had disposed of some Russian assets, reducing its total exposure to about $120m, but retains shares in Sberbank. Hospitality sector fund Hostplus has also disclosed it holds Sberbank shares, worth $49.2m as of 30 September. However, a spokesperson said the $76bn fund currently had direct holdings of Russian stocks and bonds totalling just $19m. “We continue to work with our existing managers across our investment portfolios and continue to monitor the impacts of this evolving situation especially in light of the Russian Central Bank ordering market players to reject attempts by foreign clients to sell Russian securities,” the spokesperson said.",News/Australia news,Australian Retirement Trust joins other super funds in divesting from Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/03/australian-retirement-trust-joins-other-super-funds-in-divesting-from-russia
3/3/2022,"How do you evade a rampaging crocodile? By zigzagging as you run, according to Margaret Atwood, since crocodiles, apparently, struggle to navigate corners. It’s a piece of wisdom she imparts in passing in one of the essays in her latest collection. To be clear, the burning questions of the title are less to do with crocodiles and more concerned with those issues “we’ve been faced with for a century and more: urgent climate change, wealth inequality and democracy in peril”. The most serious questions of all, then. Still, the crocodiles are indicative of a sensibility that prevails throughout: droll, deadpan humour and an instinct for self-deprecation that saves the work from grandstanding or piety. The novelist’s essay collection has become a curious genre in recent years. Zadie Smith and Salman Rushdie periodically produce them to fanfare, but really there’s no reason for us to expect writers of fiction to be qualified to comment on fact. For every writer that proves themself a stylish and smart observer of reality, another dismays us with windbaggery and vanity. Atwood’s essays luckily escape that, but they do have the whiff of a publisher capitalising on the odds and ends that litter the successful writer’s desk – the keynote speech here, the guest lecture there. Still, there’s something cheerfully game about how politely Atwood thanks her hosts for their invitations to speak at the “Carleton School of Journalism and Communication”, “the Charles Sauriol Environmental Dinner” and the “Department of Forestry’s Centennial”. She’s both gracious and tongue-in‑cheek about the grandeur of these occasions. This is Atwood’s third volume of essays since 1960. It begins in 2004 and runs into 2021. As a summary of the travails of the millennium thus far, it’s a fair guide. She writes through the aftermath of the twin towers attack, the Obama years, the financial crisis, the Trump era, the #MeToo movement and the Covid-19 pandemic. There’s not a word on the double Booker stooshie of 2019, but there are other personal reflections, on the TV adaptation of The Handmaid’s Tale and the death of her husband, Graeme Gibson. Here, Atwood is generous and unguarded – exactly what you would hope of her. Some of the most interesting essays are about other writers – such as Rachel Carson, the marine biologist and author of the landmark environmental science book, Silent Spring, whom Atwood reveres. Canadian women get particularly tender consideration. In a piece on LM Montgomery, Atwood sensitively directs our attention not to the incorrigible, redheaded Anne of Green Gables, but to the unbending and overlooked Marilla who adopts her. Her 2008 essay on Alice Munro is the best thing you’ll read on the Canadian Nobel laureate. Munro, she explains, is not Chekhov, but Cézanne: “You paint an apple, you paint an apple over again, until this actually familiar object becomes strange, luminous and mysterious; yet it remains only an apple.” Exactly so. But Atwood doesn’t always stick to the script. When PEN International invite her to reflect on “the writer as political agent”, she demurs “because I don’t believe that writers necessarily are political agents”. To insist on such a thing “breaks the bond between the writer, such as me, and you yourself, Mysterious Reader”. Still, the question of how we write literature in the face of catastrophic climate disaster is a burning one. “The arts are not something separate from us, to be taken up and discarded at will … We are hardwired for them, you might say.” This isn’t an answer, but it is a pledge to keep looking for stories equal to our desperate situation. Sixty years since her first essay collection, Atwood seems here to be handing over the reins. “I’m an icon,” she says, and “once you’re an icon you’re practically dead, and all you have to do is stand very still in parks, turning to bronze as pigeons and others perch on your shoulders and defecate on your head”. It’s a characteristically dry remark, but it’s also a passing of the baton to “the post millennials” whom, she observes, will be soon in charge. “Let’s hope they use their power wisely. And soon,” she writes. Meanwhile, Atwood remains frank, honest and good company.  Burning Questions is published by Chatto & Windus (£20).

3/3/2022,"Early in the process of writing the film Wall Street, Oliver Stone found his drafts to be lacking in authenticity, so he sought out a guide to walk him through the wild world that was boom-time 1980s finance. The man Stone eventually found was an ideal guide, a cutthroat capitalist who bit everything but his tongue while antagonising the executives at the companies he took over – most times with hostility. This man not only greatly informed the character that became Gordon Gekko, but one of this man’s shareholder meeting harangues provided the skeleton for Gekko’s timeless “greed is good” speech. This man, as it happens, was Carl Icahn, the estimable financier and principal subject of Icahn: The Restless Billionaire – the HBO documentary that sifts for meaning in Icahn’s four decades-long impact on the American financial system. And while the connection to Gekko, which Stone himself reveals in the film, would appear intended to reinforce the popular perception of Icahn as a heartless one-percenter who only cares about the bottom line, the Restless director Bruce David Klein sets up the legendary wolf of Wall Street – whose worth is at least $17bn – as a paradoxical figure at first. On the one hand, explains the New York Times’ Andrew Ross Sorkin, who leads the parade of financial journalists who drop in throughout the film, if Icahn wasn’t the Street’s pioneering corporate raider, there’s no doubt he relishes playing the villain – one who openly boasts about firing “12 floors of people” and delights in openly sparring with fellow billionaire investors like Pershing Square’s Bill Ackman. On the other hand, Icahn could just as easily be called a corporate advocate for weeding the country club mentality from C-suites that too often hold companies back from performing to potential and posting returns. Just last week he framed the purchase of a small stake in McDonald’s as an effort to improve the treatment for the pigs the company sources for meat products. Whether he actually shares the passion his vegetarian daughter, Michelle Icahn Nevin, has for animals or is simply looking for another way into a big score remains to be seen. Far less dubious is the rationale for spending 100 minutes with the 86-year-old businessman whom one pundit affectionately calls capitalism’s “great white shark”. Immediately, you see how Stone could be inspired. Good or bad, the man is definitely a character. Where another billionaire might awe the viewer with the trappings of wealth, Icahn comes off as one of the residents at Del Boca Vista, the zany retirement community of Seinfeld lore. (The late oilman T Boone Pickens describes Icahn in the doc as “about as smooth as a stucco bathtub”.) Icahn trades volleys with his wife, Gail, on the tennis court and in every conversation. He ribs Michelle for treating him like a “moron” when she over-explains how to put on a set of headphones. He quotes Rudyard Kipling. And he tarries in his own resolved feelings about his parents, a reflex that seems about par for a middle-class Jewish kid from Far Rockaway, Queens – to say nothing of a marked betrayal of the slicked-back Gordon Gekko persona. Icahn’s fractious relationships with his parents don’t just go a long way toward explaining his closeness with Michelle and his son and heir apparent, Brett – the brains behind Icahn’s prescient investments in Netflix and Apple; it primes the portrait of Icahn as the ultimate outsider who came to dominate the game through hard graft, grit and brass-knuckled negotiating. (Gail is quick to point out that her husband isn’t motivated by money.) At first the game was poker (which paid his way through Princeton and made for a plush stay in the army). Then it was short-selling. Icahn is no less forthright about his inability to turn around TWA, a loss that still smarts. Never mind if in the grand scheme of the collapsing airline business, it hardly seems like much of a failure now. If anything, the TWA folly reinforces Icahn’s earlier assertions in the film about making money “because the system is bad, not because I’m a genius”. Still, he could have said more – a lot more – about his relationship with Donald Trump, whom he not only supported but advised for a time on financial regulation. But because Klein didn’t view the relationship as all that important, here Icahn happily holds his tongue. In the end, Klein’s film lands more like a love letter than an exposé. And given the degree of access Icahn granted him and his crew, it would have been a surprise if the final product turned out to be a withering critique of our corrupted financial system. And yet you can’t help but come away from the film feeling as if capitalism’s apex predator would have been game to make that movie. Instead, Icahn and his film make a compelling case as the victim of the grubby money-manager class he spawned. In a career that has seen the rise and fall of the junk bond trader Michael Milken, Bear Stearns credit default swapper Jimmy Cayne and Ponzi scheme king Bernie Madoff, Icahn at least can justifiably claim he might be the only honest dealer at the casino. You can’t call it greed. You can’t call it good either.

3/3/2022,"A police officer charged with murder over the shooting of an Aboriginal man has told the court that the man put a hand on his gun during the fatal incident. Zachary Rolfe, who continued his evidence in the Northern Territory supreme court on Thursday, also told the court Kumanjayi Walker appeared to repeatedly stab another officer after a shot was fired. Rolfe shot Walker three times while trying to arrest him on 9 November 2019 in the remote community of Yuendumu, about 300km from Alice Springs, the court previously heard. The court previously heard Walker, a 19-year-old Warlpiri man, had stabbed Rolfe with a pair of scissors shortly before the first shot was fired. Rolfe is not charged in relation to this shot. He is charged in relation to the second and third shots fired at Walker. He has pleaded not guilty, and his lawyers have argued his actions on the day were justified in light of the risk that Walker posed to him and a colleague, the then-constable Adam Eberl. Rolfe told the court on Thursday that his recollection of the night was that almost immediately after he had asked Walker to put his hands behind his back he started to resist. He said Walker started to strike him with his right arm, in a downward motion, and he thought it was “strange” Walker was not using his knuckles as he raised his left arm and left shoulder to protect his neck. He said that at this time he noticed Walker had a “metal blade” in his right hand, and that he was stabbed in the top of his shoulder as he had his left arm extended. He said that soon after he used his left fist to jab Walker in the face. Rolfe told the court that as he raised his left arm he also instinctively reached for his Glock handgun with his right hand, and he noticed Walker had his left hand on the weapon. He said he then twisted his hips back with speed to knock Walker’s hand from the gun, and then stepped back, at which time he said Walker’s attention turned to Eberl. Rolfe said that he feared for Eberl’s life and soon after drew and fired his gun for the first time. He noticed the shot had hit Walker, but believed the shot had “not at all” incapacitated him. Soon after, Rolfe said he saw the pair fall to the ground, where they continued to fight. He said he saw Walker’s body behind Eberl, with both men facing the same direction. He told the court he believed he could see Walker’s right arm moving and repeatedly stabbing Eberl – who he knew was not wearing body armour – in the chest region. Eberl was found to have a minor scratch near his left armpit after the struggle, but he told the court during an earlier hearing he could recall it being caused by Walker. Rolfe said that he then walked across the room to the pair, placed his hand on Eberl to ensure he did not move back into his line of fire during the struggle, and shot Walker twice more in the side of his body. At the time, he said he feared for Eberl’s life, and that he had been trained to use his forearm in such situations. “I believed he could have been seriously wounded or potentially suffered a fatal stab wound in that fight,” he said. Rolfe was asked by one of his barristers, David Edwardson QC, why he had not put his hand on his gun when he entered House 511, as he had when searching another house for Walker only minutes earlier. Rolfe said that he didn’t “perceive a threat”, and that he did not recognise Walker when he first walked towards the officers in House 511. He said he also did not notice Walker had a hand in his right pocket, which the court has previously heard is where police suspect the scissors had been hidden. “I believed we were just going to have a conversation,” Rolfe said. Rolfe said that he understood that when Eberl said to him “did you, fuck” after the third shot was fired that he was referring to whether he had shot Walker. He said that he believed the incident had left Eberl in a “heightened state” and that he was “just suffering from auditory exclusion” and had therefore not heard the shots. Rolfe said that was why he had responded to Eberl’s query with “it’s all good, he had scissors in his hand, he was stabbing me, he was stabbing you”. Rolfe was asked extensive questions by Edwardson about what he discussed at Yuendumu police station in the minutes before he shot Walker. Prosecutor Philip Strickland SC has previously told the court that understanding the plan that was in place regarding Walker’s arrest and who knew about it prior to the shooting is valuable context that should be considered by the jury alongside the shooting itself. Rolfe told the court that the Yuendumu sgt, Julie Frost, told him on the night of 9 November 2019 that her preference was for Walker to be arrested at 5am the following day as she was tired, wanted to sleep and have the night off. Frost denied in her evidence that wanting to sleep was the main reason for this plan. She agreed she was tired and that fatigue in local members was part of the reason for the IRT deployment, but the main reason for the early morning arrest plan was to grab Walker when he was likely asleep and another local officer could assist with identifying him. Rolfe said Frost told him there was no new intelligence about where Walker could be, and that she agreed with a course of action he proposed for the officers to introduce themselves to locals given they were “guests” of the community while gathering information on where Walker could be. He said Frost told him multiple times that if they happened across Walker they should arrest him. He said he did not receive a copy of a document known as the operational plan from Frost, and that she did not speak to him about it. He said Frost told him he could randomly breath test drivers during his shift, which he said “confused” him as it was his understanding his sole “mission” was to arrest Walker. Rolfe also tried to clarify what he described as “confusion” regarding evidence given by other witnesses, including that given by multiple police about the term “clearing” a house. He said the term was interchangeable with “check” in the context of searching houses in Yuendumu. Under cross-examination from Strickland, Rolfe said he had attempted to join the elite ADF Special Air Service Regiment (SAS) during a “rut” in his policing career, but had to withdraw from the recruitment process because of injury. But he denied he was drawn to the “excitement” or “adrenaline” of high risk or tactical operations, such as those he had occasionally performed with the NT Immediate Response Team (IRT), and that he was hoping to be part of a mission to arrest Walker. “I wouldn’t have been upset in the slightest if I hadn’t have been called up,” Rolfe said. The cross-examination is expected to continue on Friday.",News/Australia news,Zachary Rolfe trial: police officer charged with murder tells court Kumanjayi Walker put hand on his gun,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/03/zachary-rolfe-trial-police-officer-charged-with-tells-court-kumanjayi-walker-put-hand-on-his-gun
3/3/2022,"The most restrictive abortion law in the US has inflicted “devastating” consequences in Texas since it was introduced six months ago, according to healthcare providers and pro-choice groups. Senate Bill 8 (SB 8) bars the procedure once embryonic cardiac activity is detected, typically at six weeks of pregnancy or earlier, with no exception for rape or incest. As most people are not aware they are pregnant this early on, the unprecedented law amounts to a near-total ban. It also delegates enforcement to private citizens, in lieu of the state, encouraging anti-choice vigilantes to sue abortion providers as well as anyone who “aids or abets” care for damages of at least $10,000, creating a chilling effect among abortion supporters. Amy Hagstrom Miller, president and CEO of Whole Woman’s Health, which operates four abortion clinics in Texas, described the panic, fear and anguish of patients unable to obtain constitutionally protected healthcare in their home state. She said her clinic staff had transformed counseling sessions into trauma and grief support, coupled with travel logistics advice. “For six months we have heard the cries and pleas of Texans who have had their healthcare freedoms stripped away,” Hagstrom Miller said in a recent press briefing. “In many cases, there is nothing we can do for them other than listen, hold their hands and dry their tears.” Under SB 8, abortions in Texas have fallen by almost 50%. Texans have been forced to travel hundreds – or even thousands – of miles for abortion access, with an average distance that is 14 times greater than before, according to the Guttmacher Institute. This is only if they can find the necessary resources including time off work, childcare, lodging, transportation and others necessary to cross state lines. Some Texans are being forced to carry pregnancies against their will, providers say. They stress the impact of SB 8 falls hardest on low-income people and black and brown communities. “Senate Bill 8 has been absolutely devastating for Texas communities, especially for people who call on abortion funds for support,” says Amanda Williams, executive director of the Lilith Fund. Abortion funds that offer financial assistance to low-income patients and people of color said they were now spending “six times more” on travel expenses under SB 8 in a video detailing the impact of the law. Anna Rupani of Fund Texas Choice says the number of people leaving Texas for abortion care has risen fivefold among those they help. Similarly, Kamyon Conner of Texas Equal Access Fund reports 91% of those who call the non-profit are in need of out-of-state care. “People in this state are being forced to travel for healthcare,” Conner said. “We need the support of everyone in the country right now.” Planned Parenthood recently released new data showing a nearly 800% increase in Texas patients at their health centers in nearby states, including New Mexico, Kansas, Colorado and Missouri in the first four months of SB 8 compared with last year. Planned Parenthood clinics in Oklahoma alone saw a nearly 2,500% increase in patients from Texas. “These numbers are staggering and just one part of the devastating picture on the ground in Texas and the surrounding states,” said Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. “[T]he country’s most restrictive abortion ban has led to continued chaos and a sustained crisis for patients and providers in Texas and beyond. This reality is heartbreaking and a glimpse of what’s to come should the supreme court restrict the constitutional right to an abortion even further.” Clinics in neighboring states have become overburdened with an influx of patients, causing a ripple effect across the US reproductive health network. Kathaleen Pittman, clinic administrator at Hope Medical Group for Women in Shreveport, Louisiana, said in her 30 years as a provider she had “never been so afraid” for her patients, most of whom live at or below the poverty level. With a nearly 50% jump in Texas patients, the clinic is “overloaded” and cannot schedule appointments until one month out. “Our staff is exhausted and the phone calls are nonstop,” says Pittman. “Women are crying because they can’t understand how a state can have so much control over their lives.” Despite legal efforts from Texas abortion advocates, the US supreme court – now stacked with conservative anti-abortion justices – failed to halt the extreme measure on more than one occasion and has largely stripped providers of their power to challenge the law. In January, the conservative fifth circuit court of appeals asked the Texas supreme court to determine if narrow challenges against state medical licensing officials can proceed, and providers await that decision. However, they consider the move by the conservative fifth circuit an attempt to “further slow-walk the case” and allow SB 8 to remain in place indefinitely. “The supreme court greenlit this law’s unprecedented vigilante scheme and essentially said that federal courts are powerless to stop it. There is no end in sight to this nightmare,” said Marc Hearron, senior counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights and arguing attorney for the plaintiffs. “What is happening in Texas should be a grave warning for the rest of the country. This is a preview of what will happen on a much larger scale if Roe falls.” The US supreme court is poised to overturn or undermine the pivotal 1973 Roe v Wade ruling that guarantees the right to abortion care. The upcoming decision, in response to a 15-week Mississippi abortion ban, is expected in June. In addition to SB 8, Texas passed a “trigger law” that would automatically bar all abortion care if Roe falls. The Women’s Health Protection Act, a measure that would codify Roe into federal law – and potentially help Texans – was blocked by Senate Republicans on Monday. “This is a tragedy. Abortion providers alone cannot fix this,” Hagstrom Miller said of SB 8. “This should not be the reality of abortion care in the United States.”",News/US news,‘A grave warning’: six months of Texas abortion ban sow fear and anguish,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/03/texas-abortion-ban-six-months-grave-warning

That depends on size. How big was this one? It was 8.83mm. “It’s pure white, almost perfectly round. Really very nice – a it’s the perfect pearl,” said Maria. She would say that. What do the experts say? Who needs experts? But OK, Eddi Levi, the manager of DSL Pearl in New York, said the value of a pearl depends on its lustre. The shinier the better. A good one, of that size, could be worth $10,000. Dull and blemished, on the other hand, maybe a few hundred. Whatever it turns out to be worth, it’s a lot better than finding a dead mouse in a loaf of bread. Yes! There have been lots of weird and not so wonderful things found in food over the years. Like an actual tooth in a block of cheese, a frog in a can of Pepsi, a condom in some chips, allegedly, and another mouse inside a tin of beans. It’s usually mice. There’s a difference here, though. Pearls are found naturally in molluscs – they belong. Condoms in chips, less so. True: lethal spiders in bunches of bananas is another common find. Yes, but you probably wouldn’t want to find a spider in your bananas, whereas a beautiful – and possibly valuable – pearl is nice. More like finding a golden ticket inside a chocolate bar. It’s just a shame it didn’t happen on the Spresslers’ 30th anniversary … Let me guess, that’s … Exactly, the pearl anniversary. Do say: “The world is your oyster.” Don’t say: “Oops, swallowed it. I’ll have a look later …”",Lifestyle/Food,"Waiter, there’s a pearl in my dinner!

3/3/2022,"You can stride energetically across lonely crags, declaiming in a grand Tennysonian voice about “always roaming with a hungry heart”, or you might shuffle up High Holborn, thinking of Celia with “nothing on”, as did Adrian Mitchell. Poetry walks take many forms: some places demand epic stanzas; others respond to limericks. You can walk for a few minutes, or weeks. The point is that walking with poetry is great fun. Maybe it’s the rhythm thing: our language must have been invented and honed by miles of walking. In fact, as soon as we were walking long distances and trying to remember routes, poetry probably began to be useful as a navigational mnemonic. Walking does lend itself perfectly to learning lines and recitation, something kids are good at and enjoy. John Cooper Clarke said you learn the lines at 12 and find out what they mean 30 years later (he also said “I hate walking”, but we’ll step over that). If there is a prepared route, fine. Some of these 10 suggestions have that, and others make use of existing footpaths, but they all share a link between landscape and poet. There are many more poetic walks available (try Simon Armitage’s brilliant Stanza Stones around the Pennine Way), but too few dedicated to female poets. Isn’t it time we had a Stevie Smith Way in north London, or a Barrett Browning Trail around Ledbury? The following collection features walks that are ready to roll, best done with headphones and an audio link to the poems where possible. Spotify has poetry from all these choices, sometimes read by the poets themselves. Other sources can also be found online. The best poetry walks match excellent verse, superb scenery and a good footpath, but there is an extra element that helps too: historical resonances. The 400th anniversary of the Pendle witch trials in 1612 was the perfect pretext to devise this 48-mile hike across Lancashire from Sabden via Pendle Hill and the Forest of Bowland to Lancaster. En route, Duffy’s atmospheric poem is inscribed on 10 posts. Here, heavy storm-clouds, ill-will brewed,Over fields, fells, farms, blighted woods.On the wind’s breath, curse of crow and rook.(from The Lancashire Witches) Arriving in Lancaster, check out the castle where the witches were tried, then walk the half mile to The Golden Lion pub where the poor unfortunates had their last drop to drink. Finally, head up to Golgotha on Moor Lane where they were hanged.

His voice, grim with good-humoured contempt, has often nailed down Salford. Get the train up to Clifton, north-west of Manchester, then follow the Salford Way long-distance footpath as it niggles its way south along the banks of the River Irwell to Salford Quays. Take a spur up Great Cheetham Street. This land has Cooper Clarke’s cuban heels all over it. He grew up on the corner of Bury New Road. His secondary school was here: “It was quite tough,” he once said. “We had our own coroner.” Take a right and another down Camp Street, the greasy star of the poem Beasley Street (and its gentrification-skewering follow-up Beasley Boulevard). In the cafes of the Quays, take a seat and look up some other local alumni: Lemn Sissay, JB Barrington, Longfella and Mike Garry. Then go in the art gallery and see how Laurence Stephen Lowry painted thousands of John Cooper Clarkes into his pictures.

With the Seamus Heaney HomePlace centre in the village as a starting point, head down to Poet’s Corner coffee house and turn right past Bellaghy Bawn where there is a statue, The Turfman, inspired by Heaney’s poem Digging. From there it’s a half mile down to Lough Beg where a boardwalk takes you along the shore. In summer, when it’s dry underfoot, you can get out to Church Island, reputedly visited by Saint Patrick on his way down the River Bann and mentioned in Heaney’s poem The Strand at Lough Beg. Download the Seamus Heaney HomePlace app and hear the poems on your walk. Walk: 3 milesEat: Poet’s Corner Coffee HouseStay: There’s only one place for Heaney fans: Laurel Villa in Magherafelt (doubles £95 B&B). Heaney tours from £95 Few poets pass into the august ranks of those who were banned, but Lawrence does. His collection Pansies was seized by Scotland Yard in 1929 and had to be privately printed after being smuggled into Britain. Arguably his best poetry is about nature, but not often the British kind: Hummingbird, Kangaroo and Snake are strange bedfellows on a stroll around Eastwood, Lawrence’s home town, but at least you get to wonder, in amazement, how these redbrick lanes spat out such a bright and shiny pip. The quick sparks on the gorse-bushes are leapingLittle jets of sunlight texture imitating flame;Above them, exultant, the peewits are sweeping:They have triumphed again o’er the ages, their screamings proclaim.(from The Wild Common) The start of any walk is the DH Lawrence Birthplace Museum in the centre, heading out to the various houses he lived in. A pint in the Sun Inn is a worthy literary objective as the pub appears in both Sons and Lovers and Lady Chatterley’s Lover. A two-mile extension gets you into High Park Wood alongside Moorgreen Reservoir, a walk Lawrence did many times to visit his close friend, Jessie Chambers, who lived at Haggs Farm. Walk: around town and up to Moorgreen Reservoir would be around six miles; map: OS Explorer 260Eat and stay: The Sun Inn (doubles from £60 room only) is around the corner from the DH Lawrence Museum Philip Larkin is inextricably associated with the city of Hull, “this dreary dump, East Riding’s dirty rump”. For some, no doubt, the harsh critique remains true, but Hull is much altered since Larkin’s day (he lived there from 1955 until his death in 1985), and is slowly shaking off the legacy of being vandalised, first by the Luftwaffe, then by its own planning department. “I like it because... it’s on the road to nowhere,” said Larkin. Sexual intercourse began,In nineteen sixty-three,(which was rather late for me)Between the end of the “Chatterley” ban,And the Beatles’ first LP.(from Annus Mirabilis) Start at the poet’s statue in the railway station, then call in at the nearby Royal Station Hotel bar, a favourite haunt. From there, walk east to the City Hall, a memorable element in his poem Broadcast, passing many grand buildings, including Ferens Art Gallery – definitely worth a visit – before heading off into the superb old town with its famous street, Land of Green Ginger, and several fine Larkin-associated pubs. The trail finishes at Cottingham cemetery, where Larkin is buried. Walk: 3 miles, map: Larkin Trail download available (pdf)Eat: The White Hart. For cafe food, try Thieving Harry’s by the Humber DockStay: Royal Station Hotel (doubles from £42 room only) was a Larkin favourite This Gloucestershire village is best known today for Stinking Bishop cheese, but it was once home to an illustrious clutch of poetic talents. Edward Thomas, Rupert Brooke and Robert Frost all stayed here in the years before the first world war, drawn by the bucolic splendour of the countryside, and the poets Wilfrid Gibson and Lascelles Abercrombie were both local residents. Frost and Thomas often walked together and Thomas’s indecision about which route to take inspired Frost to write The Road Not Taken. Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,And sorry I could not travel bothAnd be one traveler, long I stoodAnd looked down one as far as I couldTo where it bent in the undergrowth(from The Road Not Taken) Two eight-mile poetry walks have been devised around the area, one circling north towards the Malvern Hills past Frost’s house, the second east towards the Forest of Dean. The Daffodil Way is also recommended, especially in springtime. Frost encouraged Thomas to concentrate on poetry, not criticism, and it worked. Thomas’s classic burst of nostalgia, Adlestrop, was conceived during a railway journey to Frost’s house in Dymock in June 1914. His evocations of winter are great for long, frosty forays through the woods, “Out in the dark over the snow, The fallow fawns invisible go.” Walk: Daffodil Way and Poet’s Path I and II are about eight miles; map: OS Landranger 149 and 162Eat and stay: Beauchamp Arms (in Dymock) is a lovely pub but has no rooms; Three Choirs Vineyard, two miles from Dymock, has lodges and rooms (doubles from £165 room only) in a glorious setting. Come tourist bods of dear old Slough, have you never pondered how your dreary dive might take a bow, and cash in? But the Berkshire town has no Betjeman trail, perhaps still smarting from one of English literature’s greatest muggings. You have to go to Cornwall for a Betjeman trail, across the River Camel estuary from Padstow, where the poet laureate lived the last decade of his life, having spent boyhood summers here too. Those moments, tasted once and never done,Of long surf breaking in the mid-day sun.A far-off blow-hole booming like a gun.(from Cornish Cliffs) Start at Rock (where the Padstow ferry lands) and walk north along the South West Coast Path to Daymer Bay, “sand in the sandwiches, wasps in the tea”, then looping back to St Enodoc Church where Betjeman is buried, surrounded by the golf club links immortalised in poems such as Hon. Sec. and Seaside Golf: “Lark song and sea sounds in the air, And splendour, splendour everywhere.” There is a lot to enjoy along the way, from SSSI sand dunes to bronze age burial mounds and a holy well said to have been visited by Jesus. Walk: 4.6 miles, map: OS Explorer 106, southwestcoastpath.org.ukEat: Blue Tomato Cafe in RockStay: lots of choice either in Rock or in Padstow The true apostle of the “Christ came to the West Country” school was impoverished book illustrator William Blake. Artist, engraver, poet, – if it was hard to pin down Blake’s genius in his own time, it’s just as hard to decide which “trail” should be his. London was his uneasy home for most of his life. You could walk from Tate Britain (after viewing his paintings) to St Paul’s along the Thames Path, then cross the Millennium Bridge and head north-east for Bunhill Fields, where he’s buried. And did those feet in ancient timeWalk upon England’s mountains green:And was the holy Lamb of God,On England’s pleasant pastures seen!(from Jerusalem) Blake was happier, for a while at least, when he moved to Felpham, near Bognor Regis, on the south coast, taking up residence in a cottage near the Fox inn. There’s a short walk that connects the cottage, Hotham Park and other landmarks. The house where Blake wrote his most celebrated poem, about building paradise in England, is permanently closed, awaiting funds for restoration. We can only hope the great man would appreciate the irony.

The two places are actually only about a mile apart as the crow flies. In between you get the Jurassic coast, Corfe Castle, Lulworth Cove and plenty of fine ridgeways, woodlands and rivers too. Had I but lived a hundred years agoI might have gone, as I have gone this year,By Warmwell Cross on to a Cove I know,And Time have placed his finger on me there(from At Lulworth Cove a Century Back) Better known for his novels, Hardy actually gave up writing anything but poetry over his last three decades and published more than 900 poems in his lifetime. References to the landscape and rural life abound in classics such as Wessex Heights, A Sheep Fair and Afterwards, but it’s Hardy’s bittersweet tone and sceptical outlook that separate him from his contemporaries.Walk: 217-mile circuit.

Before the first world war, it was Edward Thomas who did more than anyone to promote this unusual poet, writing about Davies: “In subtlety he abounds, and where else today shall we find simplicity like this?” The Autobiography of a Super Tramp (1908) made his name, followed by A Poet’s Pilgrimage (1918), an engaging picaresque stroll around South Wales. What is this life if, full of care,We have no time to stand and stare.No time to stand beneath the boughsAnd stare as long as sheep or cows.(from Leisure) It would be difficult, if not suicidal, to replicate the same journey now, as Davies used the main roads, but his literary technique wears well: walk all day, reach a town and head for the pub(s), engage locals in conversation and write it down. Better to use the coastal footpath these days: start from Carmarthen and head for Laugharne, stopping if you require in Llansteffan and St Clears. Dylan Thomas didn’t think much of Davies, but they both liked a drink. Finish off at Browns Hotel. Thomas did, plenty of times.

3/3/2022,"Untrue claims about genocide and authorities in Kyiv supporting nazism are among the most common falsehoods pushed online amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict, according to analysis. NewsGuard, a US-based organisation monitoring the trustworthiness of news and information websites, said Russian state media sources are being joined by lesser known sites in pushing deceptive narratives. It published a top 10 Russia-Ukraine “war myths” including an “attack” on a chemical plant in eastern Ukraine and claiming legitimacy for the 2014 referendum on Crimea joining Russia. The warning came as Facebook and Instagram said on Monday they were blocking access to the Russian state media outlets RT and Sputnik across the EU. TikTok has followed suit, while YouTube has blocked the broadcasters on its platform in the UK and Europe and Twitter indicated it would block RT and Sputnik in the EU. NewsGuard said it had identified and is tracking 114 web domains including Russian state media sources such as RT, Sputnik and Tass but warned that websites with no direct links to the Kremlin are pushing false content on mainstream social media platforms. “Russia employs a multilayered strategy to introduce, amplify, and spread false and distorted narratives across the world – relying on a mix of official state media sources, anonymous websites and accounts, and other methods to distribute propaganda that advances the Kremlin’s interests and undermines its adversaries,” the analysis said. “Its government-funded and operated websites use digital platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and TikTok to launch and promote false narratives.” NewsGuard said the outlets pushing disinformation included anonymous websites, foundations and research websites with indeterminate funding. The major social media platforms have said they are on alert for disinformation linked to the Russian invasion. The owner of Facebook and Instagram, Meta, has launched a “special operations centre” to monitor content related to the week-long conflict, while Twitter said it has suspended more than a dozen accounts that originated in Russia. YouTube and TikTok have also said they are closely monitoring content related to the conflict. These are NewsGuard’s top 10 Russia-Ukraine “war myths” – followed by NewsGuard’s refutation: “Russian-speaking residents in the Donbas region of Ukraine have been subjected to genocide.” The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe has found no evidence of this. “Polish-speaking saboteurs attempted to bomb a chlorine plant in Donbas.” The video of the “attack”, for which there is no evidence, was recorded days before it is alleged to have taken place. “Ukrainian forces bombed a kindergarten in Luhansk, eastern Ukraine, on 17 February 2022.” The shelling came from Russian-separatist frontlines. “Russia did not target civilian infrastructure in Ukraine at the start of invasion.” One day after the invasion, Amnesty International documented at least three Russian military attacks on civilian areas in Ukraine. “Nazism is rampant in Ukrainian politics and society, supported by authorities in Kyiv.” The candidate for the far-right nationalist party, Svoboda, won 1.6% of the vote in the 2019 presidential election. “The west staged a coup to overthrow the pro-Russia Ukrainian government in 2014.” There is no evidence supporting the theory that the 2014 Maidan revolution in Ukraine was a coup orchestrated by western countries. “The US has a network of bioweapons labs in eastern Europe.” The claims are based on a misrepresentation of the US Department of Defense’s Biological Threat Reduction Program. “Nato has a military base in Odesa, southern Ukraine.” Foreign military bases are not permitted in Ukraine. “Crimea joined Russia legally.” The UN Assembly declared a 2014 referendum that backed Crimea joining Russia was illegitimate. “Modern Ukraine was entirely created by communist Russia.” Russia and Ukraine’s shared heritage dates back more than 1,000 years.",News/World news,Analysts identify top 10 ‘war myths’ of Russia-Ukraine conflict,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/03/russia-ukraine-conflict-top-10-war-myths-newsguard
3/3/2022,"“If someone deletes their comment, that’s success for me,” says Andrew Tierney. “Hopefully, that person will think about what they’re saying in the future.” Tierney, who goes by the name @cybergibbons online, is part of a new breed of cycling activists. After noticing an increase in the amount of abuse and violent threats on social media directed at people who ride bikes, Tierney decided to take action. He started calling out the posters online, with the result that many deleted their comments or even their accounts. “If someone says something racist [online], on the whole, people will challenge those views,” he says. “It should be the same for threats made against cyclists; challenge those who make these statements.” There has been a noticeable increase in virtual threats against cyclists since the Highway Code changes and clarifications have been in the news, Tierney believes, and he has started responding to the most serious ones. “It was on TikTok that I suddenly thought: ‘Wow, people think it’s socially acceptable to make [comments about harming cyclists]’,” he says. “A user made a comment about harming cyclists if they saw them adhering to one of the new Highway Code rules, and it got lots of likes.” Getting such a post taken down can be difficult and slow when reported via the tech platforms, but can be easy and swift when contacting the user directly, Tierney says. He was shocked to discover that many of those making hateful comments use their real names. “You click on their profile picture, and it’s their normal account; there’s no hiding involved,” he says. “There can be videos of them with their kids, yet they’re making a statement that they want to go out and harm someone, and they think that this is completely acceptable because it’s a comment about cyclists. That genuinely shocked me.” Tierney has nearly 38,000 followers on Twitter and is a recent returnee to cycling. “I got into cycling again during lockdown. I realised how cycling had changed; it’s now a lot more popular than I remembered from my university days. “By and large, the cyclists I see on the roads follow the Highway Code, taking the lane where it’s appropriate, for instance. But a lot of drivers seem to take issue with cyclists doing that. “I started noticing people casually posting on social media that they would run over cyclists next time they see any ‘hogging the road’, even when cyclists taking the lane are doing something that’s completely legal and always has been. That blew my mind.” It's honestly brilliant how many people delete comments about running over cyclists when you tag their wife and mum. Tierney believes poisoning the online well can have real-world effects. “Someone stating on social media, ‘Let’s run over cyclists’ can make other people think it’s acceptable to intimidate cyclists in real life,” he says. “Some of the hate comments are supposed to be jokes, probably done for likes. But even if it is just a joke to the poster, people reading those comments might be encouraged to harm cyclists in real life.” He wonders how many close overtakes – so-called punishment passes – are happening soon after reading online comments raging against people riding bikes. “Many of the most aggressive motorists might have been radicalised online. The belief that [motorists] have more right to be on the road than cyclists isn’t hard to find.” Many of those posting threat-to-life comments are professional drivers, says Tierney. “They post pictures of their truck or put their employer in their profile. It’s shocking that someone who drives for a living jokes about killing cyclists and does so publicly.” Tierney’s takedowns involve contacting those spouting the hate, including sending messages to professional drivers. “I remind them that they’re representing their company,” he says. Offensive posts are often deleted after that contact, but if not, Tierney contacts the companies concerned. “Businesses should be made aware that their employees are threatening to harm people,” he says. He has no way of knowing if his emails to employers get results because the typical response is that the company is dealing with the complaint internally. Still, comment deletions are normal, and so are full account wipes, or the accounts are subsequently made private. “People seem to be surprised when you contact them after they’ve made some hateful comment, but I tell them I’m looking at things that have been said in public.” I'm using four fake Facebook profiles and one real one to challenge people around cycling.It's interesting how people respond to the different profiles.Seems far more likely that the women get condescending responses. Tierney says he does not identify or dox people. “There’s been a few accounts where I’ve posted screenshots of the comments made, but I don’t dox; I don’t include the account holder’s real name if they don’t use it online; I don’t think pile-ons help. I don’t harass these people, or want them to be harassed by others,” he says. “I don’t want to suppress people for having a different opinion; I’ve only contacted people who’ve made direct threats to harm. I’ve gone on social media and found people who are saying: ‘I’m gonna keep a tally of how many cyclists I’ve run over this year.’ I filter down to people making the most serious comments and then ask them whether they really mean what they wrote. This has caused a lot of people to delete comments and caused others to delete their accounts.” No, I don't accept that it's a joke. It's not a joke to me.Cyclists die at the hands of drivers who can't control their emotions.It might be a joke to you, but each time someone reads a comment like that, they think it's normal. It's totally unacceptable. Tierney says many of the most egregious abusers are easy to find making similar comments across multiple platforms. “It’s common to find that someone will be on Twitter, on Instagram, on TikTok, and on Facebook, using the same [social media] handle and making the same kind of hateful comments. It would be great if everybody challenged these comments when they see them,” Tierney suggests, but he admits this is not for the fainthearted – few of the replies he receives are timorous. “There is a hardcore who feel like they’re entitled to say they’re going to harm and scare cyclists. I think what I do is a fairly effective way of challenging these people.”",News/Environment,The man challenging anti-cycling trolls to change their ways,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2022/mar/03/anti-cycling-trolls-andrew-tierney-online-abuse
3/3/2022,"South-east Queensland residents have been urged to take shelter – some told to leave their homes immediately – as a precaution ahead of “extremely unstable” storms that could bring hail and heavy rainfall to areas still affected by severe flooding. Large parts of the region remain underwater and residents have barely started to clean up after floods which killed nine people and damaged more than 17,000 homes and businesses. Police are still searching for an elderly man who fell from a boat into the swollen Brisbane River near Breakfast Creek on Saturday afternoon. On Thursday, state authorities sought to clear schools from Moreton Bay, north of Brisbane, to Bundaberg, asking parents to pick up their children early, before the storms arrived. The Lockyer Valley town of Grantham, which flooded severely in 2011 and again this week, was evacuated on Thursday. All schools in south-east Queensland will be closed on Friday – except for the children of essential workers – and people across the region are being urged not to leave home unless necessary as a precaution. Authorities have also urged people to cease clean-up operations, as the forecast storms could pose renewed danger to communities where rivers remain flooded, and where residents are still counting the cost of damage caused by the “rain bomb” storm that lashed Brisbane and surrounds until Monday. “These are unprecedented times,” the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said on Thursday morning. “We are warning people that this is a serious situation. It is extremely unstable weather conditions. “I’ve lived in Brisbane essentially all my life and I haven’t seen storms and floods like this all being thrown at us at once.” The Bureau of Meteorology has said the conditions are “very volatile” and that storms would be “dangerous and potentially life-threatening”. Up to 150mm of rain could fall in some areas, heaped upon more than 1,000mm of rain during the past week in Brisbane and surrounds. Meteorologist Laura Boekel said that flooding over the past week meant waterways did not have “capacity to take on any more water”. “For today, the creeks are a real concern and a real focus because they are rising quickly,” Boekel said. “They cannot take any more rainfall. They are what we call saturated. “The severe storms are expected to continue into this evening, and we’re still expecting storm activity tomorrow and into the weekend. “With severe thunderstorms comes severe hazard and phenomena and that doesn’t just include the heavy rain, it includes the potential for giant hail, as well as damaging winds.” The deputy police commissioner, Shane Chelepy, warned people whose homes had been flooded: “There is a possibility your home will be inundated again.” “Please do not move back into your homes if you have been inundated,” he said. “What we don’t want is for emergency services at midnight tonight needing to come back into those areas and evacuate you again.” A “mud army” of volunteers helping residents to clear out flooded homes has been suspended until Saturday at the earliest, the Brisbane lord mayor, Adrian Schrinner, said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The decision to evacuate Grantham came after storms hit Brisbane and surrounds on Thursday morning. The Grantham catchment had more than 80mm of rain and authorities said sounding the evacuation siren in the town was “a precautionary measure”. The morning storm was short-lived, but dumped enough rain to prompt warnings that several river systems would flood. The Logan River catchment, south of Brisbane, and the Bremer River at Ipswich were both rising.

3/3/2022,"Hello, Warren Murray with you again. Here are the stories that matter most. The Black Sea port of Kherson has become the first major Ukrainian target to fall under de facto control of Russia forces, based on statements by its mayor, who said residents should obey a curfew imposed by the “armed visitors”. Igor Kolykhaiev said he had made “no promises” to the Russians and he was “only interested in the normal life of our city! I just asked [them] not to shoot people”. The UN high commissioner for refugees said a million people had fled Ukraine “in just seven days”. Russian forces are understood to have surrounded Ukraine’s biggest atomic plant. Zaporizhzhia houses six of the country’s 15 reactors. Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), called for the plant’s workers to be left alone to do their jobs. Russian artillery and missiles have continued to bombard other major cities including the capital, Kyiv, and the second-biggest city, Kharkiv, where a Ukrainian member of the European monitoring mission was killed in the bombing. Fierce fighting is believed to have taken place in the port of Mariupol in the south-east, where Ukrainian forces were reportedly surrounded by the Russian-aligned forces. The UK and 37 other countries have formally referred reports of atrocities committed in Ukraine to the international criminal court (ICC) – the largest such referral in the court’s history. An emergency session of the UN general assembly has voted overwhelmingly to deplore Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and called for the immediate withdrawal of its forces: 141 voted for the resolution, 35 abstained, and five – Russia, Belarus, Syria, North Korea and Eritrea – voted against. The civilian tally in Ukraine is feared to be much higher than the hundreds estimated by the UN. Ukraine’s government has said nearly 6,000 Russian troops have been killed; the Kremlin put the figure at 498. In Russia, police arrests of anti-war protesters have included terrified children and an elderly woman said to have survived the siege of Leningrad. Russian oligarchs have been squeezed further as German authorities reportedly seized the $600m superyacht belonging to Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov in a Hamburg shipyard. It came after Roman Abramovich put English football club Chelsea up for sale, nearly 20 years after he took control. Oligarchs under sanctions have been linked by the Guardian to almost £200m of property in London and the home counties. Keep checking our live blog for further developments. Tube strike – No tube services will operate across London today, it is expected, as London Underground workers strike for the second time this week. Transport for London (TfL) said people should work from home, or walk or cycle, otherwise expect crowding and delay on other trains or buses. The 24-hour strike, which started at midnight, follows a similar walkout on Tuesday by members of the RMT union in a dispute over jobs and pensions. ‘Intervene early’ – Sarah Everard’s murder a year ago revolutionised how the British public understand male violence against women, according to research for the charity Rosa. The first major survey of women’s groups in the UK since the 33-year-old’s murder by serving police officer Wayne Couzens also worryingly reveals the majority of charities believe the risk to women and girls has increased over the last year. A pending report by the IOPC watchdog is expected to find the Metropolitan police made errors after receiving claims that Wayne Couzens indecently exposed himself days before the murder. The IOPC is also investigating Kent police over an incident six years earlier that may have involved Couzens. Sandra Laville writes this morning that as government advertising puts a spotlight on male violence against women and girls, there is still a need to tackle underlying causes “by challenging the normalisation of pornography, by intervening early to address the attitudes of boys and young men, and by pursuing a zero-tolerance approach in schools to misogyny”. McDonnell, Abbott skip rally – Labour backbenchers including John McDonnell and Diane Abbott pulled out of attending a Stop the War rally in London on Wednesday amid pressure from Keir Starmer over the group’s stance on Ukraine. The Labour leader told his party’s MPs on Monday there was “no place” in the party for anyone drawing a “false equivalence” between the actions of Nato and those of Moscow. Labour sources have suggested backbenchers criticising Nato or the western alliance could be suspended. McDonnell told the website LabourList: “People are dying on the streets of Ukrainian cities. This is not the time to be distracted by political arguments here … So I won’t feed into that distraction by going tonight.” GMP must do better – Greater Manchester police (GMP) continue to investigate crime poorly 14 months after being placed into special measures; still take too long to answer both 999 and non-emergency calls; and remain short of personnel, according to an inspection report. Only 8.5% of crimes recorded in Greater Manchester in the year ending 31 March 2021 resulted in action being taken, compared with a 14.4% average across England and Wales. Only West Midlands police fare worse. GMP’s deputy chief constable, Terry Woods, insisted the force had improved, with response times to the most serious incidents down from 21 minutes to an average of 17 minutes. “Whilst this is still above our overall target of 15 minutes, we are already seeing five of our districts reduce their response times below this.” Volodymyr Ksienich, 22, has returned to Ukraine to join the defence of Kyiv.

As uncertainty swirled around at the club, Romelu Lukaku scored the winner as the Blues twice came from behind to win 3-2 at Luton in the fifth round of the FA Cup. At Anfield, Takumi Minamino scored twice in the first half to put Liverpool in control as they beat Norwich 2-1, while Southampton beat West Ham 3-1 to reach the quarter-finals for the second successive year. In the Women’s Super League, Arsenal moved five points clear of the title holders, Chelsea, with a dominant 4-0 defeat of Reading.

Max Verstappen has signed a new deal with Red Bull that is set to land him one of the biggest paydays in Formula One history. And Eddie Jones has made eight changes to his 25-man squad and has dispensed with more than 200 England Test caps for next week’s Six Nations game against Ireland. The global economic fallout from the Russian invasion of Ukraine continued to mount, as the price of Brent crude oil added another 3.4% to climb to $116.80. With the cost of commodities such as aluminium, iron ore, copper and wheat also on an upward curve, economists are concerned about the threat of rampant inflation and recession.

3/3/2022,"Sydney and the Illawarra region of New South Wales have avoided the worst effects of the devastating east coast low that instead eased and shifted west over Newcastle and the Hunter region. Newcastle remains under a severe weather warning with falls of 60 to 100mm possible over six hours and the associated risk of flash flooding. Major flooding also remained possible at Windsor on the Hawkesbury-Nepean River, thanks to heavy rains in the surrounding catchment areas. The major flooding at North Richmond may be close to its peak, the bureau said in its most recent update on Thursday afternoon. Authorities had to prepare for the worst as Warragamba Dam west of Sydney started spilling on Wednesday, but rainfalls were less than expected. The gauge at the dam itself collected 237mm in the 48 hours to 9am Thursday, but just 5mm up to Thursday 3pm, Ben Domensino, a senior meteorologist at Weatherzone, said. The east coast low developed into three separate areas of circulation just off the coast. “That means it’s not a strong and well-defined low pressure system, and this is weakening near the coast,” Domensino said. The Hunter will see ongoing rain, but for Sydney and the Central Coast there should only be showers. Showers near Sydney “won’t be doing too much to raise river levels”, he said. However, there was another upper-level low pressure system crossing south-eastern Australia this weekend. “Some models are suggesting that will cause heavier rain to redevelop from Sunday over eastern NSW and into Monday, with the potential for another low pressure system forming near the coast early next week on Monday or Tuesday.” Earlier on Thursday, about half a million people across NSW were under evacuation orders or warnings as the wild weather that battered parts of eastern Australia for a week bore down on the greater Sydney region. Steph Cooke, NSW’s emergency services minister, said the state had 76 evacuation orders in place on Thursday morning affecting 200,000 people, with a further 18 evacuation warnings covering about 300,000 residents. “We have 500,000 people in our state right now who are either the subject of an evacuation warning or an evacuation,” Cooke said. The evacuation orders covered areas of northern NSW and parts of the greater Sydney region and the Illawarra. The Bureau of Meteorology issued multiple warnings for rivers to flood and for severe weather to affect a region of eastern NSW from near Taree, north of Newcastle, down almost to Moruya Heads on the south coast. Flood warnings were in place for the Hawkesbury and Nepean rivers near Sydney, prompting many of the evacuations overnight, but also for the Wilsons, Richmond and Clarence rivers in northern NSW, where there have been record floods. Warragamba Dam west of Sydney was spilling at a rate of 225 gigalitres a day with a predicted peak rate of 300-350GL a day – half the worst-case scenario. That meant thousands of households and businesses could avoid damaging flooding from the Hawkesbury and Nepean rivers north-west of Sydney. The BoM noted major flooding continued along the Hawkesbury and Lower Nepean rivers, however. “River levels are continuing to rise at Windsor where major flooding may develop Thursday evening,” the bureau said. “Further heavy rainfall is forecast today and into Friday which may result in extended and possibly higher major flood peaks. River levels at North Richmond are expected to remain below those observed during the March 2021 event.” The NSW State Emergency Services had received a total of 11,747 requests for help since the start of the floods crisis, with 1,462 calls coming since 3.30pm on Wednesday. The Insurance Council of Australia said insurers have received 60,163 claims related to the ongoing flooding in south-east Queensland and NSW. About 83% of total claims relate to property with the remainder for motor vehicles, the ICA said. “Based on previous flood events the current cost of claims is estimated to be about $900m,” the council said on Thursday. The heavy rain and potentially damaging winds and dangerous surf were the result of an east coast low that was located about 100km east of Newcastle at 6am on Thursday. Sydney’s forecast had been revised lower to between 50mm and 90mm of rain from an earlier prediction of 100mm to 150mm on Thursday, as the low looks likely to cross the coast farther north. There remained the chance of a possibly severe thunderstorm.Where thunderstorms form, there is the risk of locally intense rainfall, reaching as much as 200mm over six hours, leading to dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding, according to the bureau. Many schools were closed across NSW and the SES was encouraging people in affected areas to avoid all non-essential travel. Rainfall in the 24 hours from 9am Wednesday topped 100mm in areas of Sydney’s south, west and north-west, while the central business district collected about 50mm. Warragamba Dam spilling, with the government on Wednesday saying the worst case could see as much as 600 gigalitres a day flow over the wall. During the March 2021 floods, the spill rate got to 440-460GL. pic.twitter.com/vnqiprJlwV The NSW deputy premier, Paul Toole, said on Wednesday the worst-case scenario was for Warragamba Dam to spill at 600GL a day. That would have been well above the 440GL to 460GL a day peak rate during the March 2021 floods. The Warragamba spill will add to other flows coming into the Hawkesbury-Neapean River. At North Richmond, one area being evacuated, the flow is already above major flood levels. @BOM_NSW @BOM_au pic.twitter.com/26TUWigqTl The @BOM_au is forecasting the Hawkesbury-Nepean River to approach or exceed the March 2021 flood peaks. Here's how the river looks at Windsor as its rise is starting to level off. pic.twitter.com/UGXWjcK5DM The forecast offers little solace for many along the eastern seaboard, with more rain predicted for the coming week. And over the next eight days, still lots of rain forecast, including over areas already flood hit. @BOM_au pic.twitter.com/rhAh4i3yMh Domensino said the slow-moving system had continually exceeded forecasts for rainfall. “This heavy rain has all been fed by an atmospheric river that’s just been dragging moisture across the Coral Sea and the Tasman Sea and directing it towards the east coast,” Domensino said. Similar big flooding events around the world have followed such patterns. “There is a climate change signal in atmospheric rivers, and that’s been one of the components of this event.”",News/Australia news,"NSW floods: Sydney and Illawarra dodge east coast low after 500,000 people faced evacuation across state",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/03/nsw-floods-almost-500000-people-across-greater-sydney-under-evacuation-orders
3/3/2022,"The head of the New South Wales Transport department has produced a dossier of documents he claims showed staff in transport minister David Elliott’s office – including his chief of staff – were fully briefed about last week’s rail shutdown, despite the minister’s claim he was left in the dark about the closure. In the days after the sensation shutdown of the state’s rail network, the NSW transport secretary, Rob Sharp, produced a detailed timeline of the hours leading up to last week’s rail shutdown in which he insisted that the minister’s office was fully informed of the closure. The dossier of documents, released on Thursday, include the chronology of events to defend his department’s role in the closure. In it, Sharp stated the department was in “ongoing consultation” with Elliott’s chief of staff “throughout the day” on the Sunday prior to the shutdown, and cites a message which he insisted confirmed “Minister Elliott’s approval”. It followed Elliott’s insistence that the first he became aware of the shutdown was on Monday morning after the decision was made. In the document, Sharp included a previously reported text message sent by a senior transport official, Megan Bourke-O’Neil, to Elliott’s chief of staff at 10.43pm in which she warned of “massive disruption” on the network after failed negotiations between the government and the state’s rail union ahead of planned industrial action. Elliott has previously insisted that the text message did not prove he was aware of the shutdown, because it did not explicitly mention a closure of the network. But the timeline also reveals that Bourke-O’Neil called Elliott’s chief of staff after the text message, a conversation which is now the subject of significant tension between the department and Elliott’s office. Sharp’s timeline states that in the call Bourke-O’Neil “conveyed [an] assessment of network risks” and the view of Sydney Trains that rail services “could not be run safely and reliably” as a result of the failure to reach an agreement with the union. But that version is disputed by Elliott, and Guardian Australia understands that his office has insisted they weren’t briefed on the shutdown, and that the Sunday night phone conversation related to the need to re-list an application before the Fair Work Commission following Sunday’s failed negotiation with the union. After the conversation, Elliott’s chief of staff texted 56 minutes later to say that Elliott had been “briefed” on the decision and was “comfortable with our position”. Bourke-O’Neil’s account of the conversation would have been the subject of detailed questioning at parliamentary estimates hearings this week, but 24 hours before being due to appear this week, she was placed on “directed” leave by Sharp. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Labelled a “cover up” and “scapegoating” by shadow transport minister, Jo Haylen, it means Bourke-O’Neil’s version of the conversation has remained secret. However the documents also show that as late as 11.43pm, Elliott’s chief of staff was informing staff in the premier’s office of “significant disruptions” and not a full-scale shutdown. “Advice is that we will not be able to run many trains,” she said in a text to Perrottet’s chief of staff Bran Black and other senior staff members in the premier’s office. “It’s going to be a rough one or two days.” Documents released through parliament on Thursday also show that department staff were discussing the views of the minister on the shutdown late on Sunday evening. As negotiations between government lawyers and the union broke down, Sharp asked one of his senior officials whether they could apply for a “termination” of the union’s protected action. In a message, the official tells Sharp there was concern about the “Ministers view of potentially having a number of days of disruption or full stoppages while we are in the hearing on potential termination and/or suspension”. It was unclear whether the official was indicating a concern previously expressed by the minister, or contemplating a potential concern from seeking a termination. Elliott’s handling of the shutdown was the subject of fierce criticism after revealed he had gone to bed before the decision to stop the trains had been made. Perrottet rebuked him for the decision, saying he “will reflect on that and realise that all ministers are available 24/7”. The premier also held a meeting with both Elliott and Sharp in which he ordered all future briefings on significant changes in the network to be given in writing. But the documents released through parliament on Thursday show the department’s insistence that it fulfilled its legal obligations to inform the minister before making a decision to close the network. The timeline produced by Sharp was provided to the secretary of the department of premier and cabinet, Michael Coutts-Trotter, as well as Black, after the premier called for an internal investigation of the events leading up to the closure. Labor has continued to call for Elliott’s resignation after the shutdown. Haylen claimed the documents showed Elliott had “misled” the public by saying he did not know about the looming shutdown. “He knew it would happen and he signed off on it,” she said.” Comment is being sought from the minister.",News/Australia news,NSW Transport chief claims documents show rail shutdown met with ‘minister Elliott’s approval’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/03/nsw-transport-chief-claims-documents-show-rail-shutdown-met-with-minister-elliotts-approval
3/3/2022,"The Australian soap Neighbours will shoot its final scene in June following a record 37-year run, after producers Fremantle failed to secure another UK broadcaster. The series, which launched the international careers of countless stars including Kylie Minogue, Jason Donovan, Margot Robbie and Guy Pearce, is the longest-running drama series on Australian television and was so popular in Britain it has been bankrolled by Channel 5 since 2008.

3/3/2022,"Zero-tolerance drug policies at universities can do more harm than good and discourage troubled students from seeking help, a report by a UK thinktank has concluded. The report from the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) highlights surveys that suggest just three in 10 students would be confident to disclose information regarding their drug use, or abuse, to their institution without fear of punishment. Meanwhile, 16% of students surveyed who use illegal drugs reported having scary experiences but did not go to hospital or seek help. “Drug-related deaths, which occur every year within universities, are largely preventable if the right policies and practices are in place,” the report says. “If zero tolerance means fewer people coming forward for help, and potentially life-saving information is not communicated to those unwilling or unable to cease illicit drug taking, then for us that is a matter of concern.” It says that helping students could include informing them about how to use drugs more safely, “however uncomfortable this may sound”, while also providing them with educational materials on how to reduce or stop their use of illegal drugs. John de Pury, the assistant director of policy at Universities UK, welcomed the report and “the clarity in which its authors put health outcomes first”. Universities UK this month announced a new taskforce, chaired by the vice-chancellor of Middlesex University, Prof Nic Beech, “to help universities understand and address drug use” among students. This academic year, at Bristol University, students are being provided with advice and support, including harm reduction sessions with a drugs worker on how to reduce the risks of using party drugs through testing kits, not mixing drugs with alcohol, and starting with low doses. “We understand that a zero-tolerance stance is harmful and damaging as it prevents students reaching out as they may fear being punished,” the university’s drug policy statement says. De Pury added: “Universities need a different conversation about drugs. We need to listen to students to understand and address harms and risks. Above all, we need an open and evidenced approach that has at its heart the safety and health of our university communities.” Mike Barton, former chief constable of Durham police, said: “The use of ‘zero tolerance’ is mystifying both in its prevalence and its futility. It results in a cruel lottery in terms of its impact on individual students and creates and fosters a wider encouragement of unsafe environments for those engaged in already risky practices.” Arda Ozcubukcu, the co-founding director at harm reduction social enterprise NeuroSight, and report co-author, said: “If students aren’t asking for help in a life-threatening situation because they worry about punishment, then that’s a serious problem. We all want students to be safe. Harm reduction-based approaches can literally save lives.” In October 2019, student Daniel Mervis, 23, died of an overdose after struggling with addiction. Mervis was a student at University College London but previously attended Oxford’s St John’s College where his struggles with dependency began. In her report last year, the coroner, Prof Fiona Wilcox, criticised St John’s College’s approach to drugs, saying its policy which threatened “to deal with [students who use drugs with] utmost severity” might discourage “students to seek help for their addiction out of fear of the consequences, either legal or disciplinary”. She added: “Support by the college may assist students … to access appropriate care, perhaps early on in their addiction and thus help prevent deaths.” A spokesperson from St John’s College said: “Following the coroner’s report after the tragic death of Daniel Mervis, St John’s College has updated its student handbook to make clear that we offer confidential advice to students to support with issues of addiction and use of illegal substances. We did this in consultation with [Daniel Mervis’s father] Mr Mervis to ensure we had fully reflected his concerns and removed any perceived barriers for those needing help and support.” The Hepi report highlights further survey data suggesting half of students would feel confident their university would deal with their drug use appropriately if they required support. “We need students to come forward if they have problems, whether in relation to drugs or as survivors of sexual violence,” it says.",News/Society,"Zero-tolerance drug policies stop UK students seeking help, report says",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/03/zero-tolerance-drug-policies-stop-uk-students-seeking-help-report-says
3/3/2022,"The Metropolitan police made errors after receiving claims that Wayne Couzens had indecently exposed himself days before he attacked Sarah Everard, an official report is expected to find. Exactly one year ago Couzens, then a serving firearms officer in the Metropolitan police, kidnapped Everard, 33, off a south London street as she walked home. He later raped and murdered her, and he was convicted and jailed for a whole-life term, with the judge equating the seriousness of his crimes to terrorism because he had used police powers and equipment to carry out his attack. Couzens struck on 3 March 2021, having gone “hunting” for a woman to attack, his trial heard. The details of his premeditated crimes rocked Britain’s biggest police force. The Independent Office for Police Conduct launched an investigation into how the Met handled a report it received from a member of the public on 28 February 2021 alleging that a man had exposed himself at a McDonald’s in south London. A second report also alleged a man had exposed himself. Details of a car were passed to police. If officers had checked the licence plate, it would have shown the car belonged to Couzens. What checks were made or progressed – which officers can do from their desk with the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency – is part of the investigation. Such checks are regarded in policing as basic. Two Met officers have been formally notified they are under investigation for potential disciplinary offences. One is severe enough to be treated as suspected gross misconduct, the most serious kind of offence under the police disciplinary system. Initially both officers faced allegations of misconduct, which the other officer continues to be investigated for. A decision on whether the officers will face disciplinary charges and a hearing is expected imminently. The IOPC investigation is examining whether policies and procedures were followed, and its report on the Met was completed several weeks ago. The Met is not the only force facing claims it missed a chance to identify Couzens as a potential threat to women before he committed the murder. The IOPC is also investigating Kent police over an incident six years before he attacked Everard. In June 2015, Kent police received a report that a man had been spotted in Dover in a car naked from the waist down. One Kent officer is under investigation for alleged misconduct and the IOPC findings are nearing completion. It is believed there may have been enough information recorded in the Kent police system to have identified the semi-naked man as being Couzens, who was then an officer at the time with the Civil Nuclear constabulary. CNC says it was never told about the incident, and in 2018 Couzens joined the Met and passed its vetting procedures. He staged a false arrest of Everard as she returned from a friend’s house during a period of coronavirus lockdown measures. He used his police warrant card and handcuffs to lure Everard off the street before strangling her with his police belt and burning her body. Everard’s remains were recovered from woodland near Ashford in Kent, about 20 miles west of Couzens’ home in Deal, a week after she disappeared. A postmortem showed she died from compression of the neck. Two inquiries are under way into the Couzens scandal, one ordered by the home secretary and the other by the Met commissioner.",News/UK news,"Met made errors over Couzens exposure claims, report to say",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/03/met-made-errors-over-couzens-exposure-claims-report-to-say
