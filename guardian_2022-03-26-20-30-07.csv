3/26/2022,"Margaret Beckett, Britain’s first female foreign secretary and the first woman to lead the Labour party, is to retire at the next election after nearly four decades as MP for Derby South. The 79-year-old, who is also Britain’s longest serving female MP, was first elected to the House of Commons to represent Lincoln in 1974 when just 27 MPs were women. There are now 220. After losing her seat five years later, she was elected by Derby South in 1983 and has been an MP ever since. After her announcement, she said on Saturday that she continues to have faith in politics, despite the bitterness and violence MPs face in the social media age. She said she would still advise young women to go into politics, telling Radio 4’s Today programme: “It wouldn’t put me off because what I felt when I was considering being an MP is I think equally true today. If you think things should be changed and you want to have a say in changing them and you don’t have wealth and power, there’s a very limited number of routes that you can use and this is the biggest of them.” Speaking about her first day at the House of Commons, she said she “vividly” remembers a police officer she knew opening the door and bowing when she arrived and saying: “Welcome in ma’am”. “We both sniggered,” she said. Years later, in 2006, when then prime minister Tony Blair appointed her foreign secretary, she said she continued to be met with resistance because of her gender. “One of the fairly senior women I knew said to me, ‘I hope you realise there are people in the Foreign Office who don’t think a woman should be foreign secretary’,” she said. “And I’m sure that was right. But I regarded that as their problem rather than mine.” After the death of John Smith in 1994, Beckett became acting Labour leader. But the party has never elected a woman as leader, while the Conservatives have elected two women to the position. Asked what the problem was, she said it was luck. “There is so much luck in politics … And it just never was the right person at the right time.” She said she believed the late Barbara Castle should have been Britain’s first female prime minister, “but it just never was quite the right time”. Asked whether she believes Keir Starmer could win the next election, she said the British public knows “how to work” the electoral system, citing the 1997 Labour landslide and the 2010 and 2017 hung parliaments. “If they want to, they can move mountains.” She added: “I’m not saying I always believe in their wisdom, depending on their decision. But I certainly believe in their ability and capacity to make that kind of change if that’s what they decide is needed.” Starmer paid tribute to Beckett’s tenure, describing her as a “legend of our party”. He tweeted: “As the UK’s first female foreign secretary, and Labour’s first female leader, she is a trailblazer. Margaret, I thank you for everything you’ve given, and achieved.” The deputy Labour leader, Angela Rayner, said she was an “inspiration”. “So many years of dedication to public service and to better politics. What a woman! And what an inspiration Margaret is to us all.”",News/Politics,Margaret Beckett will retire at next election after 40 years as MP for Derby South,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/26/margaret-beckett-retire-next-election-40-years-labour-mp-derby-south
3/26/2022,"Cold Enough for Snow is constructed as a mystery, but the puzzle is its two central characters: a mother and a daughter, who arrive separately from an unnamed country to spend a short autumn holiday together in Tokyo. The novel is Melbourne-based Jessica Au’s UK debut, elliptical and ghostly, gleaming with beautiful imagery as bright as a shoal of tiny tetra fish. It is typhoon season, and the pair’s every action – sharing meals, walking, visiting art galleries, talking obliquely about the past and the present but never the future – appears veiled, as if through a delicate, persistent mist. Despite Au’s clear, direct prose, these individuals communicate as if under water, and water is an ever-mutable symbol for a relationship which, from the outset, appears equivocal and cryptic: “My mother stayed close to me as if she felt that the flow of the crowd was a current, and that if we were separated, we would not be able to make our way back to each other”. The sense of ambivalence is as strong as Meursault’s opening lines in Camus’s The Outsider: “Mother died today. Or maybe it was yesterday, I don’t know.” The daughter, who is considering whether or not to have a child with her partner, Laurie, acts as narrator: her mother’s conversational input is minimal. The mother is depicted as hesitant, nervous, tired, ageing: a traveller overwhelmed by the strangeness of her new surroundings, although, as the daughter takes pains to note, always crisply attired: “She looked like a well-dressed woman in a movie from maybe twenty or thirty years ago, dated but elegant.” This could be a description of the book itself, which retains a formal, slightly old-fashioned quality. The daughter has an advantage in that she has previously visited Japan, and her decisions and suggestions guide their activities. Slowly, an edited backstory of both characters emerges – but even here is ventriloquised through the daughter. “I remember that my mother had once told me a story about my uncle … ” Originally from Hong Kong, as a young woman the mother emigrated to a western country – from Au’s descriptions, her destination was most likely Australia, realised with deliberate geographical imprecision, a vagueness which contrasts with the specificities of Au’s portrayal of Japan, and with distanced characters now brought face to face. “I remember” serves as the principal narrative device – but memory is subjective. As daughter and mother wander through rain-lit streets, she talks in soliloquies about her strict Catholic school, her awkwardness as a university student, her omnipresent feeling of not fitting in, no matter how hard she tries; whether through a cultural or personal inhibition it is not clear. Throughout there is the distinct impression of blame and hostility towards the mother in these targeted, precise memories, which are dotted almost as micro-stories within the main framework of the book. Every simple gesture or small undertaking hints at ritual, at journeying towards a whole state of being – whether it be reconciliation, or acceptance. Tension builds, like layers of similar colour upon a canvas: “The evening became a deep blue, the temperature began to cool. I was feeling further and further away from everything.” Is the narrator in fact alone, is the novel in fact a processing of grief and loss? This clever, phantom-like work eludes definition.

This thali, however, is Punjabi-inspired, and showcases some of gram flour’s guises: it is used twice in the kadhi pakora recipe – both in the yoghurty curry and in the fritters – and it also makes appearances in missi roti, a regional flatbread, and ladoo, a spiced sweet treat served at celebrations.

Sieve the gram flour into a large bowl, and add the salt, turmeric, ground coriander, chilli powder and yoghurt. Gently whisk in 900ml water to make a thick batter, then set aside. Put the ghee in a deep saucepan set over a medium heat. Once hot, add the cumin and fenugreek seeds and, as soon as they start to sizzle, add the garlic and ginger, and cook for a minute. Add the sliced onions and cook, stirring occasionally, for six minutes. Add the curry batter and cook over a medium heat, stirring constantly, for five to six minutes, until the mixture thickens and bubbles. Take off the heat and set aside.Meanwhile, make the pakoras. Sieve the gram flour into a large bowl and add the remaining ingredients except for the ghee. Add 60ml waterbit by bit, gently mixing it in with your fingers until everything is coated: you’re aiming for a mixture that isn’t too runny and that sticks to your hand. Pour enough ghee into a medium saucepan to fill it by half, then put on a medium heat until it’s about 175C – test by dipping in a tiny bit of the pakora mix: if it floats up immediately, the fat is hot enough; if it sinks, heat it some more. Carefully drop four tablespoons of the pakora mix one by one into into the hot ghee, and fry for two or three minutes, until golden and crisp. When done, transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain, then repeat with the remaining pakora mix. Once all the pakoras are cooked, drop them into the curry mixture, warm through on a low heat for 10-12 minutes, and serve hot.

3/26/2022,"When Newcastle’s players arrived at Dubai’s Nad Al Sheba sports complex last week sharp-eyed onlookers were astonished to spot a couple of unexpected faces. Although Isaac Hayden and Ciaran Clark had been omitted from Eddie Howe’s 25-man Premier League squad in January, they were still offered seats on the plane to a warm-weather break in the Middle East and participated fully in a week’s bonding beneath a series of scorching Emirati suns. “It’s very important we treat everyone with love and care,” explained Howe as he justified the pair’s inclusion. Football managers can never keep everybody happy all the time but Newcastle’s head coach has worked hard to create harmony at St James’ Park and the benefits are already translating into wins on the pitch. There were no victories before Howe took charge of the team in November but he has since presided over seven from 19 games, lifting Newcastle to the verge of mid-table security. Each time three points have been collected, Howe routinely asks all non-playing substitutes and squad members to join off-field staff and injured players in posing for a landmark smiling group photograph alongside those who actually played in the match. It may seem a bit cheesy to some but Howe believes such unifying exercises are every bit as integral to Newcastle’s renaissance as his reinvention of Joelinton. “It’s part of the culture we’re trying to create, a culture in which everyone’s in it together,” says Steve Bruce’s successor. “It’s not just about the first XI on the pitch; everyone at the club plays a huge part in any success.” This communitarian philosophy has proved persuasive. Perhaps most notably, Jamaal Lascelles accepts that, since Dan Burn’s £13m arrival from Brighton, his place in Howe’s starting team is no longer guaranteed. Such good grace on the captain’s part was not always a given; it is not so long ago that Lascelles expressed his displeasure in training when Newcastle’s former manager Rafael Benítez shifted him from the middle to the right of a back three. Lascelles also used to have a preference for operating alongside Clark but that failed to spare the Irishman from Howe’s January squad pruning. Not that the latter who, albeit inadvertently revealed Joelinton’s potential as a midfielder, has neglected to do his bit for the cause. In late November, Newcastle remained winless and bottom of the Premier League when fellow strugglers Norwich visited St James’ Park. To Howe’s dismay, Clark self destructed in the ninth minute, collecting an idiotic red card which left the manager forced to order Joelinton to drop back from an attacking role alongside Callum Wilson into central midfield. It initially looked a desperate measure but Newcastle’s hitherto infamously underachieving £40m Brazilian centre-forward swiftly began channelling his inner Patrick Vieira and proceeded to prove pivotal in securing a draw. A player quickly dubbed N’Jolo (after Kanté) has remained there, proving an integral element of Howe’s reshaped 4-3-3 formation, with Joelinton and either Bruno Guimarães or Joe Willock flanking the similarly reborn playmaker Jonjo Shelvey. Eyebrows lifted when shortly after his installation Howe announced he intended to rebuild the team around Shelvey’s undeniable if sometimes erratic passing talent. At different times Benítez and Bruce made the playmaker the focal point but both managers eventually lost trust in Shelvey, demoting him to the bench for lengthy periods. So far at least there is no indication of Howe following suit and it is perhaps not entirely coincidental that Newcastle’s last two games since Shelvey’s sidelining with a hamstring injury ended in 1-0 defeats at Chelsea and Everton. Benítez always said the key to engaging Shelvey’s gifts was making him feel an essential part of things and Howe appears to have done precisely that. With the Switzerland defender Fabian Schär and the Scotland winger Ryan Fraser having also improved beyond recognition since the change of management it would be unfair to say Newcastle’s revival is purely down to their having spent £90m on importing fresh legs in January. Granted Guimarães, Burn, Kieran Trippier, Chris Wood and Matt Targett have strengthened a squad missing the injured Wilson’s attacking talents but, particularly given a broken foot has deprived them of Trippier’s capacity to shape games from right back, Howe deserves considerable credit. As Allan Saint-Maximin limbered up for next Sunday’s trip to Tottenham by scoring twice in a 5-0 friendly win against Dubai’s Gulf United, managed by the former Newcastle defender Steven Taylor, on Thursday, Howe’s thoughts turned to returning home. If there are justifiable reservations about Newcastle’s Saudi ownership, there is no doubt that St James’ Park has become a happier place since a Saudi Arabian-led consortium bought out Mike Ashley. With minority shareholder Amanda Staveley now responsible for day-to-day operations on Tyneside, employees have welcomed decisions to, among several other things, pay everyone working for the club at least the living wage and turn the promotion-chasing fourth-tier women’s team professional. Tellingly, Newcastle women will play at St James’ Park for the first time when they face Barnsley on 1 May. By then Howe’s team intend to have banished any lingering relegation fears while a brand new multi-million pound community hub housing Newcastle’s charity foundation will have opened its doors to the vulnerable. Outsiders may legitimately talk of Saudi sportwashing and some fans feel ethically conflicted, but such mixed emotions should not detract from the transformative “love and care” Howe and Staveley are pouring into a club the wider city is once again starting to take pride in.",Sport/Football,Eddie Howe’s love and care steering Newcastle ever closer to harmony,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/26/eddie-howes-love-and-care-steering-newcastle-ever-closer-to-harmony
3/26/2022,"We’re a nation of gardeners, but, according to the Office for National Statistics, one in eight British households have no garden. If you live in one of these 3.3 million garden-less homes, but feel the need to get your hands muddy, there’s good news: you don’t need a garden to garden. From window boxes to parks, community gardens to allotments and street plantings, anyone can, with a little ingenuity, experience the wonder of growing things. This can be a rewarding and altruistic form of gardening – giving back to your local community, and improving the neighbourhood for yourself, for wildlife and for others. Gardening is a mindset; it’s about appreciating and understanding nature, watching the seasons change, while helping and enjoying wildlife. By viewing gardening as an act of connecting with nature, beyond simply buying seed packets or mowing a lawn, you’ll soon find the whole world is a garden to play in, share and enjoy. Across the country, people are breathing life into the soil beneath street trees – and many councils are actively encouraging it. To plant beneath a street tree near your home, first speak to your council’s street trees team to ask if it is possible in your area. You want to make sure the maintenance teams don’t remove plants as unwanted weeds. It’s best to plant local wildflowers in these spaces, or nurture existing self-sown wild plants, which insects will love. These are usually tough, easy-to-grow plants capable of tolerating drought and trampling, and many will flower for months on end. Get started this spring by adding a layer of peat-free compost, between 2cm and 3cm deep, over the soil around the tree, keeping it slightly away from the trunk. Gently fork it in to break up the soil, which is often compacted. Do this carefully so as not to harm the tree’s roots. Sow seeds of drought-tolerant wildflowers (trees suck up a lot of water) such as Achillea millefolium (yarrow), Echium vulgare (viper’s bugloss), Daucus carota (wild carrot), Knautia arvensis (field scabious), Leucanthemum vulgare (ox-eye daisy), or Hypochaeris radicata (cat’s ear). Water with a fine-spray watering can and let nature do the rest. Try Naturescape or Landlife Wildflowers for seeds, or collect free from flowers when plants nearby set seed later in the year. The Britain in Bloom competition sees volunteer groups compete to grow the most colourful street plants. Speak to your local group or start one yourself. Window boxes are miracle containers, allowing anyone to grow all sorts of plants with no outdoor space at all. Find the longest, widest and deepest that will fit on your window ledge (the best are usually from garden centres, or try worm.co.uk). Use metal brackets screwed to the wall if you don’t have ledges. Wet compost is heavy, so fasten the brackets securely if your property is on the first floor or higher. Plant window boxes with small perennials, which come back every year. In full sun, try hardy succulents such as Hylotelephium Bertram Anderson, Sempervivum arachnoideum (cobweb houseleek) and Aloe aristata (lace aloe), underplanting in autumn with spring-flowering Narcissus bulbocodium Arctic Bells. Or look to alpine plants that won’t outgrow the space, such as Armeria maritima Splendens and Saxifraga White Star. In shade nothing beats a fern, especially spreading Polypodium cambricum (Welsh polypody), partnered with flowering Tiarella cordifolia (foam flower). A large window box is perfect for indoor houseplant displays, too, doubling your growing area. Choose one with a tray to catch water, and try mixing succulents and cacti, using 50% compost, 50% horticultural grit. Rebutia “Apricot Ice” and Pachyphytum oviferum (Moonstones) are beautiful. A nice gesture for your local community is to plant a pot or two by your front door. Plants for window boxes will work well, though a large, 40cm-60cm wide pot allows for bigger plants or small shrubs. For sun, try Salvia rosmarinus (rosemary), Hebe Wiri Joy and Salvia officinalis (sage); and for shade, Hydrangea paniculata Little Lime or Mahonia Soft Caress. A handful of pots can offer as much planting space as a small patio. Add a wigwam of canes for honeysuckle and sweet peas. Apple trees, in blossom now, can grow in large pots if on M27 dwarfing rootstock. Most areas have a community garden of some sort, so find out who runs your nearest and offer to lend your services. Some will have small raised beds for vegetable growers; others, such as charity network incredibleedible.org.uk, raise a shared crop. Community gardens are particularly keen for volunteers who know dandelion seedlings from sunflowers. You could even start a community garden yourself if you spot an abandoned space – find the owners and seek permission. Although gardening involves lots of doing, there is as much joy in observing plants. Think of public parks as yours as much as anyone else’s – shared gardens with plants to enjoy through the year. See how things grow; smell and touch them; discover which plants draw wildlife. Parks are often part-maintained by volunteers, which offers extra levels of involvement, though they usually require some gardening experience. If you have no garden, eye up a neighbour’s. Many people who are elderly or less able to garden will be delighted if you volunteer to look after their neglected front garden. And the joy of helping with a front garden is that you get to walk past and enjoy it without buying your own. In sun, try Achillea Terracotta, Digitalis ferruginea Gigantea and the grass Jarava ichu; for part-shade, Astrantia Shaggy, Brunnera Mr Morse and Dryopteris cycadina (shaggy shield fern). You might start a trend and improve the look of your entire street. If you’re serious about growing, an allotment is the obvious answer, giving enough space to grow an abundance of fruit, herbs and veg. The challenge these days is that they’re popular, often with long waiting lists, because the government has been reducing their number to make way for property development. Add your name to the list at your local allotment site but be prepared to wait a year or two. While it’s better to garden close by, don’t be afraid to travel if allotments are available elsewhere. I commuted 40 minutes to my London allotment for five years and I don’t regret a minute of it given the freedom of space it afforded me.

3/26/2022,"Covid infections are rising in England and have reached unprecedented levels in Scotland and Wales. It is a picture that, in months gone by, would have caused alarm. Yet with restrictions eased and the advice to stay at home if infected with coronavirus due to be lifted on 1 April, it would be easy to think the threat posed by Covid has been neutralised. Infections may rise, in other words, but our concern need not. It is a sunny thought – but hospital figures paint a slightly gloomier picture. While vaccinations, antivirals, improved treatments and the rise of variants that are intrinsically less severe than Delta have all helped to weaken the link between infections, hospitalisations and deaths, they have not severed it. And as infection levels have risen, so have the number of Covid patients in hospital. According to the latest data for the UK, that figure has increased from 10,554 on 26 February to 17,440 on 24 March. In Scotland, the number of Covid patients in hospital has already reached a record high, with 2,326 reported on Friday, while unprecedented numbers have been reported in a number of NHS trusts around England. Among them are Northern Devon healthcare NHS trust, Royal Cornwall hospitals NHS trust, University Hospitals Sussex NHS foundation trust and York teaching hospital NHS foundation trust – the latter had 251 Covid patients in hospital on Monday, exceeding the previous high of 215 recorded on 26 January 2021. Meanwhile, the latest flu and Covid report from the UK health security agency (UKHSA) has revealed the weekly rate of Covid hospital admissions in England is at its highest for a year among people aged 75 and over. Not everyone is perturbed. Early this month the health secretary, Sajid Javid, said there was no “cause for concern”, despite the rising numbers of cases and people in hospital with Covid. It is true that, since Omicron arrived, the proportion of hospital patients with Covid who are primarily being treated for Covid has fallen, dropping from, roughly, 70% to slightly below 50%, according to UKHSA data. However, the proportion has been steady for some weeks now. In other words it is not just the number of patients who are in hospital with an “incidental” Covid infection that is increasing. Indeed NHS England figures show that on 22 March, 5,409 patients were primarily being treated for Covid in hospitals in England, up from 4,475 the week before and 3,661 a fortnight previously. That is a rise of almost 50% in two weeks. The burden felt by NHS trusts is multifaceted. More people coming into hospitals because of Covid places a direct pressure on resources. But there is also concern over rising numbers of patients who test positive for Covid but are primarily being treated for something else, as that can reduce the availability of beds for emergency admissions and those requiring planned operations, a particular concern given the staggering backlog for surgery and other care. It can also mean already vulnerable patients become more unwell. Analysts have also suggested hospital-acquired Covid infections are on the up, while hospitals have also been hit by staff absences related to Covid. “There was an expectation that there would be an uptick [in Covid cases] once measures were lifted, but people weren’t expecting quite as steep an increase, so soon,” said Saffron Cordery, the deputy chief executive of NHS Providers. “The rising number of hospitalisations due to Covid-19, rising Covid-related staff absences, and infection prevention control measures have a knock-on impact on how fast trusts can deliver backlog recovery.” Cordery added the NHS was not currently expecting the same level of pressure as before Christmas. Nonetheless some have had to take drastic action. This week East Suffolk and North Essex foundation trust (ESNEFT) and Northern Lincolnshire and Goole NHS foundation trust suspended most visiting, with a number of others including the Royal Cornwall hospitals NHS trust having previously made similar announcements. Quite how much of a big squeeze the NHS will face in the current Covid wave is unclear, or how long it will last. But with infection levels rising in all parts of England, in Scotland and in Wales it seems to many that the situation for hospitals is set to get worse before it gets better.",News/World news,"Should rising Covid infections in England, Scotland and Wales cause concern?

3/26/2022,"Anumber of climbers will crown whatever they climb in a blaze of hot summer action: dreamy purples and sunset shades of oranges and reds. This lot grow fast in the heat but fizzle out the minute the frosts appear. In short, they will live hard and die young – if you give them a warm enough corner. There are many beauties to choose from. The hyacinth bean, Dolichos lablab “Ruby Moon”, has huge, scented purple flowers which, if you’re lucky, will be followed by brilliant purple pods that can be cooked like French beans if picked young. Then there’s the Chilean glory vine, Eccremocarpus scaber, with its orange trumpets; black-eyed Susan, Thunbergia alata, and her cultivars in shades of apricot, tangerine and peach; and the dusky purple bells of Rhodochiton atrosanguineus, which make surprisingly lovely cut flowers. Nearly all of these are perennials in their tropical habitats: vines from Chile, Africa and Mexico will just about stomach our cooler summers if you sow them now and offer them the best bit of warmth your garden has. A few will make it through a mild winter if it isn’t too wet, but most will come to a swift end after a hard frost. So start them off somewhere warm indoors. They shouldn’t be planted out until all threat of frost has passed, and will need to be hardened off for two weeks before planting out. They all grow at speed, so don’t start them off in seed trays or modules – they will outgrow them in the blink of an eye. If their roots are given too little space early on, this will check the plant’s later growth, so plant seeds in a large container. I’d suggest sowing five seeds or so in a long tom (a tall pot up to two-litre capacity) or a deep root trainer with good-quality peat-free compost. Water well and cover with clear plastic until they germinate. Keep the compost damp but not wet, to avoid rotting the seed. Uncover once the baby leaves have unfurled, and place somewhere bright but not in direct sunlight. Once the first true adult leaves appear, prick them out, handling them by the baby leaves and not the stems (damaging these will often mean the end of their life). Don’t be tempted to squish their roots into their new home – the more root run they have now, the better chance they have at roaring off into growth in the garden. Give them plenty of sun – this can’t be emphasised enough – and rich but well-drained soil. Add compost to improve either thin or heavy soils. If you don’t have soil, don’t worry: they often do very well in large containers if given something to climb up, which makes them a great choice for a sheltered balcony railing and a trellis.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Start tropical climbers now for a blaze of summer glory | Alys Fowler,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/26/start-tropical-climbers-now-for-a-blaze-of-summer-garden-glory
3/26/2022,"Dudley the hedgehog was found abandoned by the roadside in June last year. He was a newborn, scarcely 48 hours old. He weighed just 37 grams. His eyes and ears wouldn’t open. A kind stranger knew just where to take him. Sandra Lowe snapped on some blue surgical gloves and went to work. She mixed up a milk solution, for nutrition, with cold fennel tea, to stop the bloat. Dudley had to be fed with a syringe every two hours. Lowe worked on him all night. Newborns are the hardest patients to treat. Lowe says: “When you get a call about a baby you think, ‘Oh God, that’s no sleep for me, for a fortnight.’” Her husband, John, helped with the night feeds. She didn’t expect this one to survive. But against the odds, he did. She discharged him just over a month later. “We called him Big Dudley,” says Lowe. “A beautiful hog.” Lowe, a 59-year-old retired psychiatric nurse, is the founder and chief medical officer of Hope for Hedgehogs, a 13-hutch residential hospital near Ryton, Tyne and Wear, which everyone calls Lowe’s hedgehog hospital. Here, in a converted shed, up to 13 infirm and premature hedgehogs are cared for by Lowe and her team of volunteers. She says: “I tuck them in at night. I know, it’s embarrassing, but I can’t sleep unless I make sure they’re OK. Do they have enough blankets? Does their heat pad need warming?” At the hospital, the hogs (as they are called in the hedgehog world) receive dedicated medical care. “Sandra works tirelessly day and night to look after these sick hogs, feeding babies, administering medication and tending wounds,” says volunteer Maria Gilroy. “She is also great fun to work with, and teaches us lots.” Looking after these spiny mammals occasionally results in injury. Last year Lowe had to have emergency surgery to remove a quill embedded in her thumb. “They kept me in overnight and put me on antibiotics,” she says, aghast. Lowe emphasises that the hogs don’t intentionally hurt her. “They’re gentle, submissive animals. Shy loners. They just want to be left alone.” Hogs get a rough deal, she points out: “We’ve taken their habitat. We put down plastic lawns, so they can’t forage.” Then there are the other dangers: “Slug pellets. Poison. Pesticides. Cars. Gutters.” In 2020, hedgehogs were added to the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List for endangered British mammals. Lowe also educates the community about how to create hog-friendly habitats in their gardens. “Lots of people spend £100 on a store-bought hedgehog house,” she says, “which is wonderful, but it’s better to donate that money to a rescue and make one yourself.” All you need is a plastic storage box: cut a five-inch hole in it, and put bowls of cat food and water inside. Weigh down the box with bricks to stop the foxes flipping it over, and voilà: a hedgehog feeding station can be yours. Lowe’s hospital is funded entirely by donations and, occasionally, her own savings. Caring for the hogs is expensive. There’s food, heat pads, bedding and cleaning supplies to pay for. On the day we speak, Lowe has spent £200 on medication. When I ask how much of her own money she has put into the hospital, she shrieks with laughter. “You’re not printing that!” she says. “My husband will go bonkers.” Lowe founded the hospital in 2018: a nearby rescue had to close down, and she offered her garden for a replacement. Since then, she has treated 153 hogs. Not all can be saved; the deaths are upsetting, but Lowe tries to focus on the hogs that made it through. Like Mad Marilyn: she had been to a few different rescues, without much luck, but after a year of careful feeding, Lowe got her to the point where she could be released. “I loved Mad Marilyn,” says Lowe. “She used to lie on my knee and I could tickle her tummy. She was gorgeous.” Lowe’s operations are thriving but overstretched. As they only have one shed, hogs in need of intensive care are housed alongside those resting up before being released. In these busy quarters many of these recovering hogs will have struggled to hibernate over the winter and gained weight. “Some of the male hogs have boobs because they just sit around stuffing their faces when they shouldn’t be,” says Lowe. Wayfair agrees to supply Lowe with an 8ft by 10ft garden shed, to be used as a quiet space where recovering hogs can hibernate. “I’m so happy,” she says. “It will make a huge difference. It means we can rescue more hogs, and get them out there, and they can have babies. It’s just wonderful when you see an animal that would have died being released into the wild.” Want to nominate someone for Guardian angel?

3/26/2022,"A former sports minister of Haiti has been accused of repeatedly raping an 11-year-old pupil while a teacher in the 1980s and is facing a civil lawsuit brought by several other alleged victims who claim he sexually abused them. Complaints against Evans Lescouflair, who served in several posts at Haiti’s Ministry of Youth, Sports and Civic Action between 2008 and 2011 and remains influential in Haitian football as president of youth side Club Sportif Saint-Louis, were sent to the commissaire of Port-au-Prince governorate on Thursday by lawyers working on behalf of Claude-Alix Bertrand and several other alleged victims. It is understood that they contain accusations that one of Lescouflair’s alleged victims killed themselves in 2008. “It’s a criminal complaint about the repeated rape of minors under 15 years old,” the lawyer Franck Vanéus told the Guardian. “The sentence for this crime is life imprisonment.” Bertrand – the Haitian ambassador to Unesco and captain of Haiti’s national polo team – told the Guardian that he was abused by Lescouflair when he was an 11-year-old student at Saint-Louis de Gonzague at the end of the 1980s. “He touched my intimate parts in a way that no one did before,” said Bertrand. “It was so uncomfortable. I didn’t understand anything, I was just a child. I asked him why he was doing it. He kept doing it and asked me: ‘You don’t like it?’ “After that day, I tried to avoid his look. But he kept me a second time, a third time. Each time he kept me apart after a class, things were going further until the day he raped me. He penetrated me. I cried, begging him to stop but nothing changed. It lasted for two years. It happened in an office far away from the classroom.” Bertrand says that he experienced severe depression but did not report the abuse because he was afraid of the potential consequences. “I grew up in a society where the teachers had all the rights,” he said. “I thought that no one would believe me. I even thought that I may be punished for it … I was only 11 years old, I was a child and I was so scared. He kept going until the day I became sick.” Bertrand’s family subsequently moved to the United States, where he has received psychiatric treatment for several years. “That place stayed in my mind,” he says. “Even today, it’s hard, I won’t lie. Since I first talked about it, my life changed. The life of my parents changed too. But I have to face it because I’m not the only victim of this man. It’s been more than 40 years that he abused young boys in our country.” Lescouflair refused to answer questions from the Guardian but told the Haitian newspaper La Nouvelliste in February after Bertrand’s accusations first went public that he had “nothing to say, since the man who made this statement is married to a man of foreign nationality” – a reference to the fact that Bertrand is gay. During his spell as sports minister, Lescouflair worked closely with Yves Jean-Bart, the former Haiti Football Federation (FHF) president who was banned from football for life in December 2020 after being found guilty of sexually abusing and harassing young female players. Lescouflair is alleged to have abused boys at the Club Sportif Saint-Louis youth system after he established an academy programme known as Anafoot with the coach Jacques Succès Orisme in 2008. Orisme died in April 2020. “Lescouflair always told Jacky to watch this boy or this boy,” said one alleged victim who did not want to be named. “Each time Lescouflair came, one boy was ‘punished’. It happened in Jacky’s bedroom. Jacky also raped many of us. But other people abused us – it was terrible. In the three months I spent there, it was a nightmare. As I said, some of my friends left with me. We were kids and on the run. We were in three categories: under-15, under-17 and under-20. I was 14 when it happened. And you know, one of my friends died because of it. He committed suicide in 2008. He was a victim of Lescouflair.” The dead player’s mother said: “We’re so afraid. Lescouflair is still a powerful man. We don’t trust Haitian justice or police. Our son died after being raped by this man. We wish to do something but what? We could be killed just by revealing our existence.” It is understood that lawyers have requested a private hearing to ensure that some of the alleged victims can maintain their anonymity. Lescouflair was accused of raping underage boys in 2010 but the case was closed by a judge citing a lack evidence. In 2015, Lescouflair was accused of abusing young players by Himmler Rebu, who served as sports minister between 2014 and 2015, in a letter to La Nouvelliste. It is also understood that Rebu sent a report to the country’s then president, Michel Martelly, that alleged some of Lescouflair’s abuses took place at the FHF’s Centre Technique National in Croix-des-Bouquets during Jean-Bart’s reign. “The topic you are investigating was the subject of an official report sent to the highest authorities of my country when I was minister of the Youth, Sports and Civil action,” Rebu told the Guardian. “I have to keep a reserve of duty and can’t answer your questions.” Meanwhile, Jean-Bart’s appeal against his lifetime ban from Fifa is being held this week, with a verdict expected in July.",Sport/Football,Former Haitian sports minister Evans Lescouflair accused of raping children ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/26/former-haitian-sports-minister-evans-lescouflair-accused-of-raping-children
3/26/2022,"Samuel L Jackson grew up watching movies on Saturdays at the Liberty and the Grand, segregated movie theatres in Tennessee. Some of the early roles he got in Hollywood didn’t even have names: he was cast, he said, as “gang member number two’, ‘bum’, ‘hold-up man’, and, unforgettable, ‘Black guy’.” But over fifty years and 152 films later, Jackson has made himself one of America’s most enduring film stars, as well as the actor whose movies have earned “more than any other actor in history,” his friend and fellow star Denzel Washington said. Jackson’s box office total is estimated at $27bn. Despite this, Jackson, 73, had never won a single Oscar, not even for his celebrated performance as a hit man in Pulp Fiction. The Academy finally awarded him an honorary Oscar on Friday, as part of the annual Governors Awards, which mark lifetime achievement in film and in humanitarian efforts. “I’m really, really proud to receive this statuette,” Jackson said. “This thing is going to be cherished.” He added: “Thanks to every person who has ever bought a ticket to any movie I was in.” Unlike the Oscars, which are driven by intense competition and internal politicking, the Governors Awards gives the Academy a chance to play nice and revisit the careers of beloved stars and film-makers. Along with Jackson, Elaine May, Liv Ullmann, and Danny Glover were also honoured. May, who started her career as a comedian in the late 1950s (including a successful and influential partnership with Mike Nichols) and broke barriers as a female director, screenwriter, and actress, was introduced by Bill Murray. May, 89, quipped that she thought she was going to be introduced “by [Ukrainian president Volodymyr] Zelenskiy, but thank god I got Bill instead.” (The Academy reportedly explored the idea of asking Zelenskiy make a video appearance at the Oscars on Sunday.) “I think this is very nice,” May added as she accepted her award. “I don’t know what else to say except, enjoy your food.” Glover, 75, received the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, and talked about how his film career was rooted in activism, including his role in the longest student walkout in US history at San Francisco State University in 1968. Alfre Woodard, who starred alongside Glover when he played Mandela on film in 1987, and founded the advocacy group Artists for a New South Africa with him, said: “Nelson Mandela welcomed us … He thought Danny a comrade, because Danny walked the walk of conscience.” Glover also saluted his “rich relationship with organised labour”, including his guest, healthcare worker union president George Gresham, as well as the legacy of his mother, who grew up in Georgia and became the first person in her family to go to college. He also drew a connection between his struggles in 1968 to secure a Black Studies department at his state university, and the current era of Republican backlash against the supposed threat of teaching “critical race theory” in schools and the New York Times’ 1619 project (which reexamined the central role of slavery in American history). “How do you get to this point? How do you move and keep moving?” Glover asked. His answer: “People move, and they continue to move.” Ullmann, the Norwegian who starred in some of Ingmar Bergman’s greatest films before becoming a director, said that Norwegian culture discouraged bragging. “That’s why I brought 20 people from Norway,” she said, “So they can tell Norway, it is true, she got the Oscar.” While some might credit the success of Ullmann’s acting career to Bergman, her longtime collaborator, actor John Lithgow said that“Bergman would probably not have been called one of our greatest film-makers without her.” Ullmann also would go on to direct younger actors, including Jessica Chastain and Cate Blanchett, in key roles. Film-maker Ava DuVernay told the Guardian the combination of artists who received Governors Awards this year was “incredibly moving”. As a female director, she said, it was powerful to see May and Ullmann honoured for their directing, “and to really remember, there’s so much attention to it now, but there were trailblazers who aren’t named in the conversation.” Jackson and Glover, she said, are “Two black men who have broken so much ground in terms of the sheer breadth and scope of work that they’ve done.” Jackson has more than 150 film and TV credits, Glover more than 200. “They’ve touched our lives and changed the culture.” “It felt like fuel, for me,” she added. “It feels like food. I feel fed.” Quentin Tarantino, who directed Jackson in some of his most famous roles, including in Pulp Fiction, told the Guardian after the awards ceremony that he believed Jackson should have won at least two previous Oscars, though he would not say for which films. But Tarantino that said seeing him honoured by the Academy was a “really cool career thing”.
