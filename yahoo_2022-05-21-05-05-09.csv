5/21/2022,"Retirees and those close to retiring are navigating the current economic and market turbulence differently than those with time on their side to wait for smoother conditions. Depending on the type of savings and the balances in their accounts, some are feeling the squeeze more than others and are employing different tactics to survive the tumult. The stock market inched closer Thursday to its first bear market since the beginning of the pandemic, just one day after the Dow and S&P 500 had their largest one-day declines since 2020. But one thing seniors seem to have in common is that feeling of deja vu. “A lot of seniors are doing the same things we've always done until we get back to reasonable times,” said Cliff Rumsey, an 82-year-old retiree in South Carolina who cares for his retired wife with Alzheimer's. He remembers when President Dwight Eisenhower's heart attack in 1955 prompted the stock market to tank temporarily. Seniors also survived 1970s stagflation, the dot-com bubble, and countless other economic pains over the decades. This time will be no different, they say. Rumsey said he and other seniors have trimmed expenses wherever they can until inflation returns to a “reasonable rate” and markets bounce back. “I do remember some of the things my parents would do just to conserve money,” he said, and he does some of the same now. Rumsey said he buys in bulk, cut back on meals and favorite name-brand items, reduces electricity usage by setting the thermostat to 75 degrees instead of 70, watches less television, and turns off lights. He also cut water usage in the yard. Rumsey admits he also does something most financial advisers would cringe at: He increased his tax withholding for his social security so he's assured a big refund check when he files his taxes. He uses that money as a savings cushion for the year. “I know financial advisers will tell you not to do that because you can take that money and put it to work, but I know myself,” he said. “If it's in my checking, it's easy for me to get to and spend it. It's not so easy when it's with Uncle Sam.” Retirees with a diversified investment plan shouldn't panic, say advisers. Instead, stay focused on your long-term goals and know that if a recession occurs, they tend to be short. From 1945 to 2009, recessions lasted on average 11 months, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the official arbiter of recessions and recoveries. That compares with an average of 59 months for economic expansion. “What’s most important is where we’re going with the investments,” said Sean Pearson, a financial adviser with Ameriprise in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania. Daily headlines screaming about stock market plunges, soaring inflation, prospects for sharply higher rates, and even impending recession are like construction and traffic on the road to your destination. “You’ll still get there but there might just be a little detour and it may take a little longer to get there,” he said. “The most important thing is we get there. The traffic doesn’t matter.” Though the market downturns may tempt you to sell in a panic, try to hold off, even if you must cut back on discretionary spending for a little while. “Diversified investments in the U.S. and global economy tend to move up more than they move down, over time, and recover, if given time,” said Rob Williams, managing director of financial planning and retirement income at Schwab. If the volatility worries you, consider making small adjustments to your portfolio, advisers say. RETIREMENT CONSIDERATIONS: Is it safe to retire now when the market is this volatile and inflation is this high? SURVIVAL MODE: Surviving stock market volatility: Diversify, pull short-term cash, don't check your account daily “You can make tweaks around the edges,” Pearson said. “If you have fixed-income investments, shorter-term is better than longer-term if interest rates are rising for a year or two. If you’re tech-heavy, look at some safer, dividend paying stocks in certain sectors. But diversification is key.” Dividend stocks attracted Mary Johnson, policy analyst at The Senior Citizens League who also is nearing the age (typically 72 years) for required minimum distributions, or the amount of money you must withdraw from almost all tax-advantaged retirement accounts each year. “Most of my retirement accounts are in dividend paying equities,” she said. “I don’t invest in other types of equities since dividend stocks at least pay you to hold them when times are bad. They also tend to beat inflation during routine inflationary times – present inflationary times not included.” If you’re not fortunate enough to have a big nest egg, things might be tougher but you can still soften the blow on what investments you might have. “If you have limited savings, and they’ve fallen in value, don’t sell to fund spending now,” Williams said. Instead, try to reduce your discretionary spending. SLOWER SPENDING: Is consumer spending about to hit the brakes again? PayPal thinks so STOCKS SLIDE: Dow, Nasdaq post biggest one-day loss since 2020 in rate hike, inflation reassessment A word of buying caution: As much as you might be tempted to use what savings you do have to “buy low” and catch the “next big thing” at a bargain price, don’t. “If you don’t have a lot of savings, don’t bet on trends,” Williams said. “Trends are often appealing, but also tend to fall hard.” Get the most out of what income you do get, whether it’s a pension payment or social security. Social security payments are adjusted yearly for inflation, rising 5.9% this year for the largest increase since 1982 when the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) reached 7.4%. The COLA increase has probably helped but hasn’t fully offset surging inflation this year. In the 12 months to April, consumer prices accelerated 8.3%, slightly down from the 8.5% pace in March but still near a 40-year high. “That’s inflation going at 65 miles per hour instead of 90 miles per hour,” said Johnson. “That’s still over the speed limit.” Based on consumer prices so far this year, social security checks could see an 8.6% bump in 2023 which would be the largest increase since 1981, Johnson said. Even that, though, is unlikely to be enough as seniors’ purchasing power from social security checks has been declining for years, she said. RECESSION INVESTING: As odds rise for a recession, what's your investment strategy? PUMPED UP PRICES: The average gas price is above $4 in every state. How long will they continue to rise? “No matter how hard we try to plan, who would have ever planned that the highest inflation in 40 years would come back from the dead like a vampire to suck the savings right out of us?” Johnson said.

5/21/2022,"There's no way around it: if the Federal Reserve is going to get runaway inflation back under control, it's going to cause some economic damage along the way. The central bank has already put immense upward pressure on mortgage rates, which have spiked from 3.11% to 5.25% over the past five months, as it works to cool one of inflation's biggest drivers, the booming U.S. housing market. If policy makers can slow down housing, they have a shot at slowing down overall price growth. ""Stock prices were very high relative to pre-pandemic, home prices are very high relative to pre-pandemic...My theory is that all of that is leading people to feel more confident and to spend more, and may be what's pushing us into higher consumption, higher spending, and higher inflation,"" said Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, on CNBC earlier this month. Does that mean the Fed will cause home prices to have their own correction? We're already seeing the U.S. housing market slow down in the face of spiking mortgage rates. Mortgage applications are declining, fewer listings are getting multiple offers, and inventory levels are rising again. However, that's a deceleration—meaning prices are going up at a more modest rate—not a price correction. Last month, Fortune reached out to real estate research firm CoreLogic to see if it would provide its assessment of the nation's largest regional housing markets. CoreLogic looked at 392 U.S. markets in April and found that 17 regional housing markets had a greater than 40% chance of seeing local home prices decline over the next 12 months. The U.S. macroeconomic situation has soured since April. To see if that downturn has shifted the outlook of the housing market too, Fortune once again asked CoreLogic to run an assessment of regional housing markets. The finding? Now 70 regional housing markets have a greater than 40% chance of home prices dropping over the coming 12 months. But before we dive deeper into the data, let's look at how CoreLogic did the analysis. In order to determine the likelihood of regional home prices dropping, the real estate research firm assessed factors like income growth projections, unemployment forecasts, consumer confidence, debt-to-income ratios, affordability, mortgage rates, and inventory levels. Then CoreLogic, which is ranked No. 952 on the Fortune 1000, put regional housing markets into one of five categories, grouped by the likelihood that home prices in that particular market will fall over the coming 12 months. (Note: The groupings are different this month than the ones CoreLogic used in April). Here are the groupings used for the May analysis: Very high: Over 70% chance of a price dip High: 50–70% chance Medium: 40-50% chance Low: 20–40% chance Very Low: 0–20% chance View this interactive chart on Fortune.com Among the 392 regional housing markets that CoreLogic measured, 144 ranked in the ""very low"" risk grouping. Another 177 housing markets landed in the ""low"" group, 44 markets qualified for the ""medium"" group, and 22 markets crept into the ""high"" group. CoreLogic categorized only four markets as having a ""very high"" likelihood of a price drop: Bend, Ore., Prescott, Ariz., Lake Havasu City, Ariz., and Bridgeport, Conn. (i.e. Fairfield County, Conn.). When CoreLogic analyzed the housing market back in April, the company found that the average market had a 13% chance of experiencing a home price drop over the coming 12 months. Now, CoreLogic says the average regional housing market has a 28% chance of a price drop over the coming 12 months. That's a 15 percentage point spike in just a one month period. Why the big spike over the past month? CoreLogic points to surging mortgage rates, declining consumer confidence, and home price overvaluation. While CoreLogic finds the odds of a home price correction are rising, it still believes nationwide home prices will inch higher over the coming year. Between March 2022 and March 2023, CoreLogic predicts U.S. home prices will rise another 5.9%. If you’re hungry for more housing data, follow me on Twitter at @NewsLambert.

5/21/2022,"Wall Street pays a ton of attention to company earnings. But reported earnings are often manipulated through aggressive or even fraudulent accounting methods. That’s why risk-averse investors need to focus on companies that generate gobs of free cash flow. Cold, hard cash is real, and can be used by shareholder-friendly management teams to: Pay inflation-fighting dividends. Repurchase shares. Grow the business organically. Investing legend and Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett is famous for his love of cash flow-producing businesses. Let’s take a look at three stocks in Berkshire’s portfolio that boast double-digit free cash flow margins (free cash flow as a percentage of sales). Sign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms. Leading off our list is oil and gas giant Chevron, which has generated $21.1 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months and consistently posts free cash flow margins in the ballpark of 11%. The shares have been hot in recent months on the strong rebound in energy prices, but with inflation continuing to heat up, there might be plenty of room left to run. Management’s recent initiatives to cut costs and improve efficiency are starting to take hold and should be able to fuel shareholder-friendly actions for the foreseeable future. In March, Chevron announced that it would double its share buyback to as much as $10 billion a year, promising that shareholders will see the benefits of high oil prices. The stock still offers an attractive dividend yield of 3.4%. With whopping free cash flow margins above 30%, credit ratings leader Moody’s is next up on our list. Despite recent weakness, Moody’s shares are up 145% over the past five years, suggesting that it’s a relatively recession-resistant business worth betting on. Specifically, the company’s well-entrenched leadership position in credit ratings, which leads to outsized cash flow and returns on capital, should continue to limit Moody’s long-term downside Moody’s has generated about $1.8 billion in trailing twelve-month free cash flow. And in 2021, the company returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Moody’s has a dividend yield of 1.0%. Rounding out our list is beverage giant Coca-Cola, which has produced $7 billion in trailing twelve-month free cash flow and habitually delivers free cash flow margins above 20%. The stock has had plenty of ups and downs in recent months, but patient investors should look to take advantage of the short-term uncertainty. Coca-Cola’s long-term investment case continues to be backed by an unrivaled brand presence, massive scale efficiencies, and still-attractive geographic growth tailwinds. And the company is back to operating at pre-pandemic levels. In the most recent quarter, Coca-Cola posted revenue of $10.5 billion, up 16% from the year-ago period, driven largely by a 8% increase in unit case volume. Coca-Cola shares offer a dividend yield of 2.9%.

5/21/2022,"When legends speak, people listen – and few investors match the legendary status of Ray Dalio. The founder of Bridgewater Associates has built his firm from a 2-room apartment operation into the world’s largest hedge fund, with more than $150 billion in assets under management, and a net gain exceeding $46 billion. Dalio believes that the next two to four years will see our global economic and political systems change in ways that are unpredictable now. And the key to survival, for investors, may be a wide-ranging stance in stocks. As Dalio says, “I want a highly diversified portfolio of assets that are not cash and bonds. I want geographic diversification as much as I want asset class diversification.” Bearing this in mind, our focus shifted to Bridgewater's most recent 13F filing, which discloses the stocks the fund snapped up in the first quarter. Locking in on two tickers in particular, TipRanks’ database revealed that each has earned a “Strong Buy” analyst consensus and boasts significant upside potential. These are new positions for Bridgewater that may shed some light on where Dalio wants to go as the market climate turns stormy. Let's take a closer look. The Beauty Health Company (SKIN) We’ll start in the self-care sector, with the Beauty Health Company. Beauty Health owns and distributes a range skin care and cosmetic brands, including its flagship brand, HydraFacial. The company take a health-centered approach, promoting healthy skin as the root of beauty; it’s products fill the gap between traditional cosmetics and medicinal skin treatments. Beauty Health entered the public markets through a billion-dollar SPAC merger in 2021, and has been making something of a splash. The company reported $260.1 million in net sales for HydraFacial last year, and saw its customer base expand to 21,719 installed HydraFacial delivery systems in more than 90 countries. In March of this year, the company introduced a digitized upgrade to the HydraFacial delivery system, dubbed Syndeo, and saw 258 trade-ups to the new system before the end of Q1. The company had other good news in 1Q22. Revenues expanded year-over-year, growing 58% to more than $75.4 million and the company reported a health mix in that total, with $33.8 million from consumables and $41.6 million from delivery systems. Beauty Health also boasts an enviable gross margin of 69%, boding well for the company's ability to advance toward profitability. Nevertheless, despite the company’s growing revenue picture, the stock is down by roughly half so far this year. Ray Dalio appears to see the low share price as an opportunity. His Bridgewater firm made a significant buy in SKIN shares, totaling 255,552 shares. At the current market price, this bloc is worth $3.07 million. 5-star analyst Kyle Rose, of investment firm Canaccord, also sees plenty of reason for an upbeat outlook here. He writes, “SKIN reported yet another impressive print with the launch of the next-generation Syndeo platform underway…. SKIN views 2022 as its final investment year, as the company continues to scale infrastructure and invest in the ongoing launch of Syndeo… While some investors remain worried about the near-term margin impact of trade-ins/upgrades to Syndeo, we believe the company continues to prudently invest in key near/long-term growth initiatives that should lay a strong foundation from which it can harvest leverage in subsequent years (in 2023+). We see no reason to change our thesis given positive underlying momentum in the business.” That thesis is a Buy rating on the stock which comes along with a $22 price target. If correct, investors could be lining their pockets with an 83% gain.(To watch Rose’s track record, click here) Clearly, the bulls are out in force for this cosmetic brand – SKIN has a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating based on 8 positive analyst reviews. The stock is currently priced at $12.02 and its average price target of $23.13 implies a robust 92% upside for the next 12 months. (See SKIN stock forecast on TipRanks) Trimble Navigation (TRMB) Now let’s shift our gears to an industrial tech company, Trimble Navigation. Trimble, based in Sunnyvale, California, provides software, hardware, and support services to a wide range of industries, including agriculture, building and construction, geospatial, government, transportation, and utilities, aimed at improving efficiency by connected the physical and digital worlds. Among the company’s products are global navigation satellite system receivers, inertial navigation systems, laser rangefinders, unmanned aerial vehicles, scanners, and software processing tools. In recent weeks, Trimble has completed a move to streamline its own operations going forward. The company divested four subsidiary businesses to Precisional, one of the affiliates of The Jordan Company. Precisional is an industrial precision measurement firm; the divisions it picked up were Protempis, Spectra Precision Tools, LOADRITE, and SECO. The financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. A few days prior to the divestment announcement, Trimble released its 1Q22 financial results – and showed a quarterly record in total revenue. At $993.7 million, the top line was up 12% year-over-year. Annualized recurring revenue (ARR) also grew 12%, and reached $1.47 billion. The company reported non-GAAP net income of $184.8 million, which translated to a non-GAAP EPS of 73 cents. On a per-share basis, this income was up from 66 cents in 1Q21 – and beat the 68-cent forecast. Ray Dalio must have liked what he saw here, because Bridgewater bought in to the tune of 143,439 shares. This new position is worth $9.32 million at current trading levels. Piper Sandler’s 5-star analyst Weston Twigg is also optimistic on Trimble looking forward, saying ‘it has not seen any recessionary signals.’ Getting into details, Twigg goes on to write, “Revenue in Buildings & Infrastructure and Resources & Utilities were significantly above our estimates, reflecting strength in construction and agriculture. With respect to current events, TRMB has cut off HW sales to Russia/Belarus (roughly 2% of revenue), but it is redirecting these sales to other customers in backlog, so it should see limited impact in 2022; related increases in commodity food prices could create longer-term tailwinds as agricultural demand picks up elsewhere.” ""We believe TRMB is making significant progress toward its software-centric, higher-margin sales model, demonstrated by strong traction with its recently-launched Trimble Construction One platform, which is cloud-based, bundled construction management SW,"" Twigg summed up. These comments support Twigg’s Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on the stock, and his $100 price target indicates room for ~54% share growth ahead. (To watch Twigg’s track record, click here) In general, the rest of the Street has an optimistic view of TRMB. The stock’s Strong Buy status comes from the 3 Buys and 1 Hold issued over the previous three months. Shares in TRMB are selling for $65.03 each, and the average target of $83.75 indicates a possible upside of ~29% from that level.(See TRMB stock forecast on TipRanks) To find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks’ Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks’ equity insights.
