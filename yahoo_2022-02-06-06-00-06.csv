2/6/2022,"After being called a liar, a south Georgia sheriff offers to pay $500,000 of his own money to anyone that could prove he is not telling the truth about his findings regarding the death of a Black high school athlete nine years ago. The parents of the deceased child have rejected official reports that say their son’s death was an accident. Lowndes County Sheriff Ashley Paulk released a statement saying he would give half a million to anyone that provides information that can lead to an arrest and conviction in the death of Kendrick Johnson. This statement comes days after he stated that he and two other officers reviewed all the evidence (17 boxes full) associated with the case and concluded no crime had been committed. Johnson’s death nine years ago and the investigation into it drew a national spotlight to the county near Georgia-Florida border. Last year renewed attention to the case was sparked with the release of the documentary “Finding Kendrick Johnson,” directed by Jason Pollock. The film questions the truthfulness of several law enforcement officials working on the case and, with the support of the family, suggests two white brothers killed Johnson, a claim that has been debunked by federal investigators. In 2013, Johnson, an African-American teenager from Valdosta, was found dead inside a rolled-up gym mat at his high school gymnasium. His mother, Jacqueline Johnson, told the Guardian that when the family reported that he had not returned home from school no one searched for him. Her youngest child was found head-down in a rolled up wrestling mat standing vertically in the gymnasium at Lowndes High School at about 10:30 a.m. on Jan. 11, 2013. In four months, after what the Johnson family considered a sloppy investigation, the Lowndes County Sheriff’s Office closed the case declaring it a “weird accident” caused by the victim who climbed inside of the mat to retrieve his sneaker. However, Johnson’s relatives did not believe this explanation. After viewing a surveillance video from the gym, the family noticed what they claim are gaps in the footage. Also, they claimed that the county coroner was not called to the school until six hours after he was found by the students and the administrators were notified. Georgia law requires the family to be immediately notified. On Thursday, Jan. 24, Paulk released a 16-page document that affirmed the original declaration that the teen’s untimely demise was accidental, citing a state medical examiner who ruled in 2013 the cause of death was “positional asphyxia,” brought on by him configuring himself upside down, in the mat which stopped him from breathing. Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson said they have proof that he is lying. The New York Times reports, the family independently hired William R. Anderson, a forensic pathologist to review their son’s autopsy. He found that the teen actually died from blunt-force trauma to the right side of the boy’s neck, near the jaw. The father said, “The truth is the truth. You can’t make an accident out of a murder.” Both examinations, Anderson’s and the one done by the medical examiner at the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, were done five months apart. Paulk rejected the family’s report, saying that yet another report done by the Office of the Armed Forces Medical Examiner came to the same conclusion as the GBI’s. OAF originally said Johnson’s death was accidental and caused by asphyxiation, but was amended. The cause of teen’s death, currently, reads on their report as “undetermined.” On Monday, Jan. 31, the sheriff released a statement doubling down on the validity of his findings. “After the release of my synopsis of the Federal files on the Kendrick Johnson case, his parents have called me a liar and continue to state that Kendrick was murdered,” the release began. The statement continued, “Because of these statements, I am personally — with my own funds — offering a reward of one-half million dollars ($500,000.00) to anyone who comes forward with information that results in the arrest and conviction of a person for the alleged murder of Kendrick Johnson at Lowndes High School.” The sheriff’s reward, in his opinion, is a gesture to edge him towards the pearly gates. In addition to his $500,000, he is suggested that others interested in adding to the pot should do so. He did not list where those dollars could be sent. Paulk maintains the validity of his report is supported by his inclusion of findings from the Justice Department, the FBI, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. attorney’s office for Middle Georgia, and several other law enforcement agencies. Among the material submitted as evidence are testimonies from 58 people given in front of a federal grand jury and the two additional autopsy reports from Anderson and the Defense Department.

2/6/2022,"“To live among the handmade,” philosopher and antiques dealer Leon Rosenstein once said, “is to live among the human.” Well, there’s nothing more human than handmade pornography. When you hear “pornography,” you might think of Playboy and Penthouse, X-rated movies and internet porn. But one type that has been largely hidden and forgotten is the pornography people make for themselves. Unlike pornography for profit, handmade pornography is crude and funny and subtle. It, too, contains multitudes. Over the past decade, I’ve visited archives and museums, met with collectors and antiques dealers, and talked with artists and scholars to reconstruct the ways people across America, from the 1830s to the 1970s, drew, painted, glued, sewed and baked their own pornography. Some altered coins or carved objects from wood, stone and bone. Others wrote stories, made pamphlets and designed comic books. Despite the concerted efforts of law enforcement and social purists to destroy sexual artifacts, thousands of these fascinating objects remain. And now I’m publishing the first history of homemade and handmade pornography. I’ve titled the book “The People’s Porn” because the objects being considered come from a true representation of the American people. As opposed to commercially produced pornography imported first from Europe to early America and then pirated as bootleg editions in major cities, these materials, often made with rudimentary artistic skills, cropped up organically in communities, small and large, across the country. Pornography went wherever Americans went – in life and in death, at war and at sea. Men carved wooden pornographic objects at logging camps in the 19th century, and they made pornographic scrimshaw on whaling vessels during the 18th and 19th centuries. Others were inspired to refashion the 19th-century liberty penny that had “ONE CENT” written on the reverse side of the coin. By changing the “E” to a “U,” many Americans had the same idea for rendering the coin obscene. Who knows how many pockets jingled with these pennies over the years? In many handmade objects, sexual gestures stand right behind propriety and erections pop up in staid places. For example, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, people made small, carved coffins as a form of memento mori that concealed carved figures inside. When you lift a coffin lid, the male figure’s erection pops up. The popular objects were hand-carved, hailing from places that still prepared their own dead for burial and still made coffins for neighbors and kinfolk. You can imagine them circulating discreetly at wakes and memorials, provoking laughter even as people mourned. Pornographic objects also leered about the barnyard, a reminder that America was a largely rural country up until the 1920s. When pornography showed cocks mounting hens, dogs humping each other and pigs acting like swine, it demonstrated that animals remained underfoot and in people’s sexual imaginations. And when called to war, men made pornographic objects out of spent shells and casings and adorned planes with their favorite nudes. Despite the postwar world’s reputation for cultural conservatism, pornographic objects continued to be made in the home. Women circulated patterns for pornographic potholders and aprons. Made with a wide variety of fabrics and trimmings, potholders came in pairs, with one side featuring a pop out penis and the other a vulva. Cookies, aprons, hook rugs, embroidery – all traditional women’s crafts – also came in pornographic form. Joined by explicitly feminist materials in the 1960s and 1970s, women’s creations show that the category of pornography can be much more capacious than you might think. People from all walks of life – young and old, gay and straight, rich and poor, Black and white – made objects that the established order found embarrassing and preferred to ignore. Using commonly available materials, they found a way to express what moved them, what frightened them, what aroused them and what made them laugh. Even as consumer culture expanded, pornography continued to be made by hand as people sought to articulate their own visions of sexuality. The mass market eventually took notice of these do-it-yourself productions, whether pornographic or not. By the 1990s, “amateur porn” started to flood the market in response to cravings for authenticity. But you shouldn’t confuse this category of commercialized porn with what people made and continue to make. Handmade and homemade materials can expand our understanding of sexuality. Sometimes it’s beautiful. Sometimes it’s ugly. As much as the world might like to limit sexuality to the realms of the uplifting and transcendent, homemade pornography – in all its incoherent, libidinal, confusing strangeness – reminds us that we are imperfect in body and in mind, subject to pain as well as pleasure, willing to laugh at ourselves and each other, and moved equally by the ridiculous, the violent and the sublime.

2/6/2022,"By Jarrett Renshaw LANCASTER, PA. (Reuters) - Republicans in Pennsylvania chose on Saturday not to endorse a primary candidate in one of the most closely-watched U.S. Senate races in the country, amid concerns they could back a candidate in a crowded field who might put them at odds with Donald Trump. The endorsement of the state committee is widely considered the early prize of primary season, catapulting its recipient to the general election. This year, the party emerges from its winter meeting less unified ahead of a wide-open primary season. Trump has not said whether he will back any of the current candidates in the contest that could decide control of Congress in November's midterm elections. Among the Republicans vying to replace Senator Pat Toomey, who is retiring, are several with ties to the former president: Carla Sands, his former ambassador to Denmark; his friend the celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz; and hedge fund CEO David McCormick, whose wife served in the Trump administration. The state committee, comprised of more than 300 local and state officials, voted against endorsing any candidate in the Senate race, or in the equally-crowded governor's race, according to two sources who attended the closed-door meeting. It was conducted by a voice vote and there was no need for a roll call, the sources said. In interviews, 25 state party committee members and Republican Party officials in Pennsylvania said they were reluctant to back one Senate candidate. They cited both the large field of 12 hopefuls and the possibility that Trump might eventually endorse a different contender. ""This was no surprise. Committee members want the candidates to stand on their own and let the voters decide,"" said one top Republican official who was present during the vote. ""Now, everyone will be working for the Trump endorsement and the best way to get that endorsement is to show you can win."" In the weeks leading up to Saturday's vote, regional Republican caucuses held straw polls to gauge support, with real estate developer Jeff Bartos garnering the most party support despite trailing in public polls. Last month, the Democratic state committee could not agree on endorsing any single candidate, but U.S. Representative Conor Lamb received the overwhelming majority of the votes ahead of Democratic rivals Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman and state lawmaker Malcolm Kenyatta, according to results viewed by Reuters. Under Democratic rules, a candidate needs roughly two-thirds of votes to earn the state committee's endorsement. Republicans require only a simple majority.

2/6/2022,"KHARKIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Thousands took to the streets of Ukraine's second-largest city on Saturday carrying banners saying ""Kharkiv is Ukraine"" and ""stop Russian aggression"", as the country braced for a possible military offensive from Russia. Weeks of diplomacy between the West and Moscow have produced no breakthrough after Russia massed tens of thousands of troops near Ukraine's borders. Moscow denies it plans to attack Ukraine but has demanded security guarantees, including a block on Ukraine joining the NATO alliance. Kharkiv, an eastern industrial city that lies 42 km (26 miles) from the Russian border, was identified by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as a possible Russian target, though his spokesman later said he was speaking hypothetically. Demonstrators in Kharkiv sang the national anthem and waved Ukrainian flags, or held up flags of allies that have supported Kyiv, including the United States, Britain and the European Union. ""The people came into the streets to demonstrate that Kharkiv is a Ukrainian city and we will not surrender it,"" said Kharkiv resident Nina Kvitko.
