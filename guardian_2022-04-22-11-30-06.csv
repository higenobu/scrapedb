4/22/2022,"Pretty incredible, when you think about it, that it’s taken this long for Anthony Albanese to get Covid. The Labor leader has been campaigning intensively around the country for many many, months, and would have had countless near misses in terms of close contacts. But the inevitable finally happened. The Labor leader tested positive for Covid on Thursday at the end of week two of a six-week campaign. What happens now, in terms of basic logistics, is a function of how sick Albanese gets. If his symptoms are mild, he’ll continue with the campaign plan, but virtually, as Joe Biden did in the United States in an effort to avoid getting infected. But the downside risk is, if his symptoms are bad, Albanese will need to disappear from view just at the point he was finding his campaign legs. Australian voters are used to presidential-style doubleheaders during election seasons, so the obvious thing to do at this point would be pass the baton to Richard Marles, Labor’s deputy leader. But Labor’s campaign spokesman, frontbencher Jason Clare, made it clear on Friday Marles would not be deputised as the Albanese stand-in. What would be happening is the shadow frontbench would be stepping forward. Clare didn’t say this, but there’s a view Marles isn’t the focal point the Labor campaign needs at the point of going negative about Morrison – which is the point the campaign has now reached. Labor’s deputy leader is not a natural attack dog and he doesn’t always land the message. Clare told journalists on Friday the team would be stepping up. “I see this an opportunity, I got to say. Not only do we have a better plan, we have a better team.” Persisting with that opportunity point, Clare was asked whether or not Australians seeing more of the prime minister over the coming week because of Albanese’s absence on the hustings would prove a positive or a negative for the Labor campaign. “I think it’s a positive for our campaign,” Clare said Friday. “The more they see of Scott Morrison, the more they will realise this government has run out of puff.” The official rationale was voters seeing more of Morrison would be a plus, because what they’d see is a prime minister shadowed by internal disputes and weighted by his record. This would help Labor’s core objective, which is to make this contest a referendum on Morrison. Familiarity would foment voter contempt in other words. “I think the real problem is the Australians know Scott Morrison too well,” Clare said. Of course this is hope, not truth, speaking. The truth is no one knows how this development will shape an election result in four weeks’ time – not Clare, or Albanese, or Morrison, or the campaign directors. This is an unknown unknown. Right now, the Labor campaign is just relieved this has happened now, after Albanese recovered from a bad start to be judged by viewers to have won the first leaders’ debate midweek and before the official campaign launch next Sunday in Perth. The 2022 campaign right now is still in practice laps because a large number of Australians are having their first real holiday in two years, taking advantage of the school holiday break before another Covid winter. That’s part of the reason Morrison sought a six-week campaign, understanding the country would not be focused or plugged in to the contest for the duration because of Easter, school holidays and the Anzac Day long weekend. The campaign acceleration point is after Anzac Day. If Albanese can be back on his feet by the end of the coming week the vacuum will be short, and on the plus side of the ledger, he will not have to risk manage getting Covid in the closing weeks of the contest, where ubiquity and momentum will matter. We can end with a couple of conundrums. Campaign strategists are always obsessed with winning the nightly television news. Albanese’s absence will make it harder for the networks to structure the daily package around the contest. But the thinking at this point is Labor will deploy a principal spokesperson in the wild each day to ensure the networks have their vision. Then there’s the question of how Morrison campaigns against an empty chair, or a chair with a temporary occupant. Morrison bludgeons in campaign mode. He’s the bluntest of blunt instruments. But the changed campaign conditions will require a bit of nuance. It will be interesting to see whether be continues in his opponent’s absence to be a bulldozer, or whether Australia’s campaigner-in-chief has the dexterity to execute a step change as well.",News/Australia news,Labor is hoping Anthony Albanese’s Covid diagnosis throws a harsh spotlight on to Scott Morrison | Katharine Murphy,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/22/labor-is-hoping-anthony-albaneses-covid-diagnosis-throws-a-harsh-spotlight-on-to-scott-morrison
4/22/2022,"There is nothing a campaigning politician likes more than a good photo opportunity and a flattering image. Scott Morrison, who has long had his own personal photographer on staff, has perfected the art. Take the black and white portrait of a studious PM working diligently as he flew west for an election campaign visit on Monday. The shot was taken by former News Corp photographer Adam Taylor, now the PM’s personal snapper, and published on the front page of the West Australian under the headline “PM’s Blueprint for Perth”. It was in stark contrast to the front pages lampooning Anthony Albanese’s election campaign, like “Does he Know his A*** from his Albo” and “Albasneezy”. Adam Taylor was credited on the photograph but there was no indication the photo was supplied by the prime minister’s office. An average reader would assume Taylor was working for a media organisation. The front page of tomorrow's The West Australian. pic.twitter.com/U5mrjykN3G Now Barnaby Joyce has joined in, appointing another highly skilled former News Corp photographer, Brad Hunter, to his personal staff to shoot his colourful antics on what is known as the Wombat Trail. And haven’t the Murdoch mastheads embraced the images. The Courier Mail published a pic of Joyce with a horse at the Paradise Lagoons Campdraft in Queensland on Easter Saturday. The Daily Telegraph ran no fewer then seven of Hunter’s photos in one story, six of them of the deputy PM frolicking with his two young boys and partner Vikki Campion at a water park. All the photos credited the deputy prime minister’s office. Of course the Daily Mail loved the water park pictures too. The Australian ran a portrait of a statesman-like Joyce in an Akubra in a rural setting, crediting Brad Hunter, but not adding the disclaimer that he worked for the deputy prime minister. A spokesman for Joyce confirmed that Hunter, who was on Tony Abbott’s staff in 2015, was recently put on the Nationals leader’s payroll. “Unlike the Labor party, which gags its MPs and staff, photographic content produced by the deputy prime minister’s office is freely available upon request,” he told Weekly Beast. “You’ll never see Penny Wong and Kristina Keneally in front of a coalmine, but the Nationals are proud to support regional industries and we’re not afraid to show it.” Anthony Albanese has digital producers who make content for social media platforms but does not employ a former newspaper photographer, a spokesman said. However, Bill Shorten did employ Andrew Meares, a former Sydney Morning Herald staff member, when he was leader. The Sydney Morning Herald and the Age have a policy of not publishing the handout photographs, a Nine spokesman told Weekly Beast. Under “exceptional circumstances” – such as Morrison meeting Joe Biden – a photograph may be used but would be clearly marked as from the PMO. Guardian Australia has a similar policy, only publishing handouts when the prime minister is overseas and no other image is available. On Friday the Daily Telegraph splashed with a story that condemned a Labor party branch for “offensive posts” which included memes using Nazi imagery – from the 60s TV show Hogan’s Heroes – on its Facebook page. “In one post, dated March 4, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg is seen photoshopped into a Nazi uniform under the caption ‘Bogan’s Heroes’,” the Tele thundered. “Mr Frydenberg’s mother was a Holocaust survivor and a number of his relatives died in Hitler’s death camps.” Another post featured Peter Dutton, Michaelia Cash and Linda Reynolds dressed as Nazis under the headline “Scomo’s Heroes”. But you only need to go back to the 2013 election to find when the Tele was very fond of a Hogan’s Heroes-inspired Nazi photoshopped images itself. The Daily Telegraph famously photoshopped then PM Kevin Rudd in Luftwaffe uniform with Nazi eagle and swastika, and Anthony Albanese in Wehrmacht helmet and greatcoat on its front page in 2013, prompting international outrage. Earlier the paper likened then communications minister Stephen Conroy to Joseph Stalin on page one. David Llewellyn-Smith, the editor of Macrobusiness, bills his online publication as “Australia’s leading business and investment blog” but he has some strong opinions when it comes to foreign affairs. An article about China’s deal with the Solomon Islands contains more than just intemperate language – it calls for Australia to “bomb Honiara”. “Whatever it takes now to prevent this outcome must happen,” Elliott wrote this week. “Either we undertake to destabilise the islands politically using whatever means necessary or we openly bomb Honiara into submission. “A smoking crater to Australia’s north is not what anybody wants but it’s transparently preferable to a weaponised Chinese satrap that all but ends Australian freedom.” Elliott defended his language in the context of how “extreme the risk” is. “Basically, if a Chinese naval base is allowed to develop in the Solomons it represents a clear and present danger to Australian sovereignty,” Elliott told Beast. Crikey’s economics correspondent, Jason Murphy, posted an apology on Twitter this week that was so detailed it won him a great deal of sympathy. “I wrote a bad article,” Murphy said at the beginning of a very long post. “This thread is my apology, and tells the story of how I went from defensive to accepting that yep, I screwed up.” I wrote a bad article. This thread is my apology, and tells the story of how I went from defensive to accepting that yep, I screwed up.🧵 1/n The apology was in relation to a story about jobseeker that Murphy now accepted was offensive to many people. Murphy explained his internal processes about the story from being defensive, “spiky and dickish” online to realising he had failed in his piece. Instantly, all the abuse he was getting online turned into praise for his courage and openness. “I owe it to readers to reflect deeply on how I wrote a story containing ideas I disown,” he wrote in Crikey. “It’s not something a person who prides themselves on clear thought should forgive themselves for. “For me, the revelation is in the term ‘lazy tropes’. Behind deadline, I wrote the article too fast and with too little reflection. In doing so I relied on ideas that came to mind fast, rather than actually searching for the truth.” Some six months after taking a “social media holiday” after posting content which breached the broadcaster’s guidelines, SBS board member Warren Mundine has thrown his support behind Katherine Deves’ controversial campaign about transgender women’s participation in single-sex sports. On Twitter, Mundine said Zali Steggall’s concerns about Deves were “rubbish” and the Liberal candidate was only concerned about “fairness and safety” in women’s sport. Zali Steggall dismisses parents’ concerns about their daughters in sport as “transphobia”. Rubbish. It’s about fairness & safety. Why should other girls & women not have what you had, Zali? pic.twitter.com/CKmIXl6wLW Last year the SBS board asked Mundine to delete a tweet in which he called journalist Ben Eltham a cunt, saying the tweet was in breach of the board’s code of conduct and did not align with the broadcaster’s values. Mundine apologised for the tweet. “SBS board members are expected to behave in accordance with the SBS code of conduct and social media protocols,” a spokesman told Weekly Beast about this latest post. “Mr Mundine is aware of his obligations as an SBS board member.” The image Mundine posted is contested as it appears to show three swimmers formed their own podium against US trans athlete Lia Thomas. An AAP FactCheck found the image was misleading because the swimmers have spoken of their support for Thomas and footage shows them applauding her victory moments before the photo. Murdoch columnist Miranda Devine loves New York so much she has made it her adopted home, joining the New York Post permanently. It appears some New Yorkers, Young Republicans and Donald Trump’s former attorney Rudy Giuliani anyway, love her back.

The first debate was of course held by Sky News and the Courier Mail in Brisbane, and although it was streamed for free on some platforms, it was not broadcast on free-to-air television. It was also tightly controlled by News Corp, with the non-News Corp travelling press banned from recording or photographing it. The only photographers in the room were from News Corp or the prime minister’s office. Every federal election the ABC invites leaders of the main political parties to take part in a debate and this year it has had discussions with both the Morrison and the Albanese camps. “The proposed debate will be broadcast live across multiple ABC platforms to provide all Australians with an opportunity to hear both leaders express their views on the issues and policies that matter to voters,” a spokesman said. “It will be hosted by experienced political journalist and presenter of ABC Insiders and Q+A David Speers.”",News/Media,Soft focus: News Corp embraces Morrison and Joyce’s flattering election photos | The Weekly Beast,https://www.theguardian.com/media/commentisfree/2022/apr/22/soft-focus-news-corp-embraces-morrison-and-joyces-flattering-election-photos
4/22/2022,"Russia has been hiding evidence of its “barbaric” war crimes in Mariupol by burying the bodies of civilians killed by shelling in a new mass grave, the city’s mayor said, as a US satellite imagery company released photos that appeared to match the site. US officials have dismissed Vladimir Putin’s claim that his forces have “liberated” the port city of Mariupol as disinformation. The Russian president made the claim despite an admission by his defence minister that Russia’s military was still battling thousands of Ukrainian troops holed up in Azovstal steelworks. Western officials said Putin is “still in a position to win” in Ukraine despite failing in his pre-war objectives. Russia had started to address some of the issues that had hindered its army at the start of the invasion, one official said. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said Russia rejected a proposed Easter truce, but that he remains hopeful of prospects for peace. Earlier this week Russia rejected the same request from the UN, claiming it was not “sincere” and would give Ukrainian fighters more time to arm themselves. Zelenskiy also told leaders of the World Bank and IMF that Ukraine will need “hundreds of billions of dollars” to recover from war. Ukraine needs $7bn each month to keep its economy afloat amid the “economic losses” inflicted by Russia, Zelenskiy said via video link. He also proposed a special war tax on Russia. World Bank president David Malpass said the physical damage to Ukraine’s infrastructure has reached $60bn. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, has confirmed war crimes experts are helping Ukraine “to ensure the inevitability of Russia’s responsibility”. The United States said it has also been in contact with Ukraine’s prosecutor and is assisting with the preservation and collection of evidence of war crimes committed by Russia, US Attorney General Merrick Garland said. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister has apologised to residents of Mariupol for failed evacuation efforts from the besieged port city. She added that authorities will not give up. Officials estimate that 100,000 people are currently trapped in the city. The US defence secretary will host Ukraine-focused defence talks with allies in Germany next week, the Pentagon has confirmed. Lloyd Austin will meet allies on 26 April at the Ramstein Air Base in south-western Germany, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said. The pentagon also confirmed newly disclosed ‘Ghost’ drones are part of America’s latest arms package for Ukraine. Russia has slapped “indefinite’ travel bans on US vice president Kamala Harris and Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg as well as dozens of prominent Americans and Canadians in retaliation for sanctions imposed over Ukraine. The Russian foreign ministry said the travel restrictions on 29 Americans and 61 Canadians - which also includes defence officials, business leaders and journalists from both countries - would remain in effect indefinitely. UK prime minister Boris Johnson has revealed that dozens of Ukrainian soldiers are training in the UK, learning how to use 120 British armoured vehicles before returning with them to fight in the war against Russia. British forces are also training Ukrainian counterparts in Poland on how to use anti-aircraft missiles, the prime minister said. About 120,000 civilians are blocked from leaving Mariupol, Zelenskiy said. Three school buses filled with people from Mariupol arrived in Zaporizhzhia today after crossing through territory held by Russian forces, but Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said the number of evacuees was far smaller than had been hoped for. Russian forces captured dozens of villages in the eastern Donetsk region on Thursday, an aide to Zelenskiy’s chief of staff said. The bodies of 1,020 civilians are being stored in morgues in and around Kyiv after Russian troops withdrew, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Olga Stefanishyna, told Agence France-Presse. Her comments came after police said they discovered the remains of nine civilians in the town of Borodianka, 54km (34 miles) from the capital, buried in communal graves and showing signs of torture. The parliaments of Estonia and Latvia have recognised Russia’s actions in Ukraine as “genocide”. In a statement, the Estonian parliament said Russian troops in temporarily occupied territories had committed “acts of genocide” against the civilian population including “murders, enforced disappearances, deportations, imprisonment, torture, rape and desecration of corpses”. Joe Biden announced that the US will provide another $800m (£614m) military assistance package to Ukraine to “further augment Ukraine’s ability to fight in the east, in the Donbas region”. The new US weapon deliveries will include 72 howitzers and their towing vehicles along with 144,000 artillery rounds and more than 120 drones tailored for Ukraine’s needs. Biden also announced that the US will accept up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees under a new programme. Russian troops have used a number of weapons widely banned across the world, which have killed hundreds of civilians in the Ukrainian region of Kyiv, research by the Guardian suggests. Evidence collected during a visit to Bucha, Hostomel and Borodianka showed that Russian troops had used cluster munitions, cluster bombs and extremely powerful unguided bombs in populated areas, which have destroyed at least eight civilian buildings.",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 58 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/22/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-58-of-the-invasion
