1/13/2022,"“It is good for us that the owner is Thai,” said Teerasil Dangda not long after he arrived in England in 2007, one of three players from the Land of Smiles to sign for Manchester City. Sven-Göran Eriksson was also grinning, albeit with some bemusement, as he lined up alongside the striker, Suree Sukha and Kiatprawut Saiwaeo, all holding up blue shirts that they would never wear on the pitch. If it was good for Teerasil, now a legend of Thai football, who said he learned a lot in his short time out west, it could have been better. Instead of being brought to Europe by his country’s former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, he could have been signed by Ange Postecoglou. Celtic’s manager has brought another Asian trio to a British club, and Daizen Maeda, Reo Hatate and Yosuke Ideguchi, all Japanese, should have more impact at Celtic than their Thai predecessors did at City. The Australian, who led Yokohama F. Marinos to the 2019 J League title, knows exactly how good these players are.  In the short term that spells bad news for Celtic’s rivals. Scottish clubs yet to get to grips with the prolific Kyogo Furuhashi, who has scored 16 goals since arriving in the summer from Vissel Kobe, may groan at the thought that Postecoglou has brought in more Japanese talent. These are three of the best players in Japan, home to one of the best leagues outside the big five of Europe. Hatate, a spiky son of a baseball player, has stood out for Japan’s dominant team Kawasaki Frontale and was named in the 2021 J League season XI. The 24-year-old has played only two years of professional football, winning two titles, and has admitted it may take time to get used to the language, culture and food in Glasgow. He is flexible enough to manage. Postecoglou has described him as an attacking midfielder and understandably so given his technique and eye for a pass, but Hatate can play in various positions. Maeda’s speed, physicality and clinical finishing – he was the league’s joint top scorer last season for Yokohama, the club Postecoglou left in June – should quickly endear him to the fans. Ideguchi may have the hardest time winning over the doubters and not only because he is a defensive midfielder appreciated more for doing the simple things well and rarely giving away the ball. He and Postecoglou say he has unfinished business in Europe after he signed for Leeds United in 2018 and then, like that Thai trio 11 years earlier, left England without playing a competitive game. The first move to Europe came too soon for the then 21-year-old. He is wise enough to know that he will be damned if he does well, with those from outside arguing it is proof of the weakness of the Scottish league, and damned if he doesn’t. No prizes for guessing what Rangers fans will want to happen, and although they may not be too pleased should this new trio shine, it would be good for Scottish football. More Japanese talent would follow. Back in 2013, Arsène Wenger, who spent 18 months in charge of Nagoya Grampus before heading to Arsenal, told everyone that the J League was worth a look: “I find that a new market that is very interesting and very competitive is the Japanese market. Look at the number of Japanese players who play now in Germany for example.” That really took off in 2010. There had been Japanese players in Germany before a 21-year-old Shinji Kagawa signed for Borussia Dortmund but the numbers increased after his stunning success. There were 12 in the Bundesliga by 2014; only Switzerland, Austria and Brazil were more heavily represented abroad. Something similar could happen in Scotland. As in Germany, some will come, shine and be sold to richer leagues for big money in the manner of Kagawa and Shinji Okazaki, others will stay for years such as Makoto Hasebe and some will, like Kazuki Nagasawa, return home fairly quickly. There will be huge interest in Japan at seeing four of their compatriots in action for a storied European club. As always, translating interest into hard cash is a challenge but it may not matter too much given that the new signings hardly broke the bank anyway. There was consternation in Japan at how cheap the deals have been, with the three commanding a total of about £3.5m in another example of J League teams being only too happy to virtually stand aside and wave their best players through to Europe. Celtic won’t care about that, the only downside being that should these three play to their potential, Postecoglou and his employers are going to face competition next time they go shopping in Japan.",Sport/Football,Celtic’s latest Japanese buys look a bargain and could set a Scottish trend | John Duerden,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/13/celtic-japanese-buys-bargain-trend-scotland-hatate-maeda-ideguchi-postecoglou
1/13/2022,"Boris Johnson has cancelled a planned visit to Lancashire after a member of his family tested positive for Covid, Downing Street has said. The prime minister had been scheduled to visit a vaccination centre, where we would have been expected to face his first media questions about his attendance at a social event in the No 10 garden during the first lockdown in May 2020.  A Downing Street spokesperson said: “The prime minister will no longer be visiting Lancashire today due to a family member testing positive for coronavirus. He will follow the guidance for vaccinated close contacts, including daily testing and limiting contact with others.” Under current rules, if someone is vaccinated, as Johnson is, they no longer need to self-isolate even if a family member has Covid. However, government guidance says they are “strongly advised” to take daily tests, and to “limit close contact with other people outside your household”. Johnson usually films a brief, pooled broadcast interview on such visit, and would inevitably have faced questions both about the alleged party and about calls for him to resign from some of his MPs after he admitted attending it. In a statement before prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, Johnson accepted for the first time that he had been at the 20 May 2020 gathering and that this was a mistake, while also attempting to defend his actions. Saying the No 10 garden was at the time routinely used as “an extension of the office”, Johnson argued that he had believed the event was a work gathering, and that the event “could be said, technically, to fall within the guidance”. While the prime minister and a series of cabinet ministers said people should now wait for an inquiry into the 20 May event and other alleged lockdown parties, being led by the senior civil servant Sue Gray, Johnson has faced calls to quit now. After Johnson’s statement, one of the Conservatives’ most senior backbenchers, William Wragg, and Douglas Ross, the leader of the party in Scotland, publicly called for Johnson to resign, saying his position had become untenable. Later on Wednesday, the former minister Caroline Nokes added her voice to those calling for his resignation. Speaking to ITV’s Peston, she said Johnson was in an “impossible position”. There was silence for much of the day from the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, the two people tipped as most likely to succeed Johnson. Explaining that he had been “on a visit all day”, Sunak gave a lukewarm response on Twitter on Wednesday evening, saying Johnson was “right to apologise and I support his request for patience while Sue Gray carries out her enquiry”. Just over an hour later, Truss tweeted that she stood behind Johnson 100%.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson cancels visit to vaccine centre as relative tests positive for Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/13/boris-johnson-cancels-visit-to-vaccine-centre-as-relative-tests-positive-for-covid
1/13/2022,"On Sunday, the deadliest New York City fire in three decades tore through a Bronx apartment building, killing at least 17 people. Among the dead were children as young as four and five. The New York City fire department blamed a space heater and a malfunctioning door for allowing smoke to spread through building. The door was “not functioning as it should”, said Dan Nigro, the FDNY commissioner. Residents told reporters on the scene that their doors often didn’t shut like they were supposed to.  The new mayor, Eric Adams, raced to the scene. Since taking office, he has impressed the public with his energy and verve, promising a “get stuff done” mayoralty. In the Bronx, his message was clear: “If we take one message from this,” he said, it was to: “Close the door. Close the door. Close the door.” “That was embedded in my head as a child watching the commercials over and over again,” Adams said. “We’re going to double-down on that message … muscle memory is everything and if we can drill that in, we can save lives by closing the doors.” The story of the Bronx blaze, however, is not one of personal responsibility. It has little to do with tenants remembering to shut doors. Future tragedies won’t be avoided through “muscle memory” alone. By blaming individual actors, Adams instead allows the true culprits off the hook: the building owners. Why did a tenant need to use a space heater? Why were the doors so faulty? It’s notable that one of the owners of the Bronx building, Rick Gropper, is a member of the Adams transition team, a landing space for those who are likely to have influence over the new administration. At least six violations, over the years, have been slapped on the building owners from the city’s department of housing preservation and development. Multiple violations cited problems with the doors, which are supposed to shut to prevent the spread of fire and smoke. Heat, as any working-class tenant knows, was another major problem. One tenant told the New York Post that “they’re sending up just enough heat to say they’re sending up heat, but it’s not enough to keep you warm, and if you don’t use a space heater, then you use your oven”. “You can’t lounge around without a housecoat on.” The systems in place seeded this disaster. It was not one person who decided to use a space heater or another who couldn’t close the door. Apartment building doors should close on their own. Space heaters, in 2022, shouldn’t be required in the dead of winter if building owners are paying to send up sufficient heat. This is the message Adams, the new mayor, should have been emphasizing: such underinvestment and neglect should be unacceptable in America’s richest city. But it remains so – the status quo, distressingly, is a stratified reality where some dwell in million-dollar condos and others suffer on the city’s margins, hoping not to freeze on the way to bed or die in a fire the next day. Investors do not buy buildings to keep people housed; they own to make money, and when collecting rent from working-class tenants, services are trimmed to drive profit margins. Why send up a generous amount of heat when a little will do? Why pay to fix a door when, until a fire kills 17 people, the day-to-day is merely tolerable? Elite neglect is at the root of the devastation. The sort of neglect that forces tenants, many of them immigrants, to haul space heaters into apartment buildings that should be generously pumped with heat. Neglect that allows millionaire building owners to shrug off multiple department of housing preservation and development complaints. A different kind of mayor would challenge the real estate industry, immediately, to do better. But New York has not had that mayor in a very long time, if ever. Even Bill de Blasio, the self-identified progressive, allied closely with the city’s largest developers and took millions of dollars from them. Adams, a former Republican, is far less tenant-friendly than De Blasio. Landlords now have a dear friend in City Hall. A simple “close the door” campaign, which Adams will be happy to embark on, is exactly what men like Rick Gropper want. More children and adults obsessing over their alleged culpability in crumbling apartment towers will mean a real estate investor class that gets to keep doing what it is has always done – cut corners to drive profits. Yes, educating the public about fire safety is important, and must continue. But if the root causes of the carnage are not identified and bad actors are not named, little will change. Now, 17 people are dead who didn’t have to die.

1/13/2022,"Nigeria has lifted a ban on Twitter, restoring access to millions of users, seven months after it clamped down on the social media site when it deleted a post by the president. Twitter was restored on Nigerian networks after midnight for the first time since June, with the government saying the company had agreed to its conditions on the management of unlawful content, to register its operations in Nigeria and to a new tax arrangement.  “The FGN [federal government of Nigeria] lifts the suspension of the Twitter operations in Nigeria from midnight of 13 January 2022,” said a statement from Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi, the director-general of Nigeria’s National Information Technology Development Agency. “The FGN has asked Twitter to fulfil some conditions before restoring its services. These conditions addressed legal registration of operations, taxation, and managing prohibited publication in line with Nigerian laws. Twitter has agreed to meet all the conditions,” the statement said. The company had agreed to set up offices in Nigeria earlier this year, register its company in the country and comply with tax obligations, the government said. Nigeria would also be added to Twitter’s “partner support and law enforcement portals”, a channel for governments and organisations to deal more effectively with potentially unlawful or abusive posts. Twitter did not acknowledge the concessions stated by the government, but said in a statement: “We are pleased that Twitter has been restored for everyone in Nigeria. Our mission in Nigeria and around the world is to serve the public conversation.” The Twitter ban was widely condemned by millions of users and rights groups, with Nigerian authorities initially threatening to prosecute users and companies who defied the ban. It followed difficult relations between Nigeria’s government and Twitter, with officials often criticising the company for not doing enough to curb abusive posts and hate speech, and blaming it for destabilising the country as protest movements used social media as an organising tool. Fears of repression and curbs on free speech by Muhammadu Buhari’s government have grown in recent years, amid clampdowns on journalists and protest groups, including on key figures in the EndSars protests against police brutality in October 2020. The ban started two days after Twitter removed a post from the president that threatened to punish secessionists which sparked mass outrage. “Many of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Biafra war,” Buhari wrote. “Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand,” referencing his role as a brigade major during the Biafra war, one of the darkest chapters in Nigeria’s history. The war ended the attempts by mainly Igbo people in south-east Nigeria to create an independent nation of Biafra and many of the atrocities committed during the conflict have not been acknowledged. After the ban, the information minister, Lai Mohammed, said the government had acted because of “the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria’s corporate existence”. Twitter and Nigeria’s government then began discussions on the conditions that would require the social media giant to become operational in Nigeria. The government said the agreed conditions “opens a new chapter in global digital diplomacy” and “set a new operational template for Twitter to come back stronger for the benefit of Nigerians”.",News/World news,Nigeria lifts Twitter ban seven months after site deleted president’s post,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/13/nigeria-lifts-twitter-ban-seven-months-after-site-deleted-presidents-post
1/13/2022,"There have been many tributes to the great choreographer Merce Cunningham, whose centenary was celebrated in 2019. But I think this one might be my favourite. It sounds like a fringe concern, contemporary juggling meets modern dance (with an experimental sound score thrown in), but at root it’s all about rhythm, and, as per the title, rhythm equals life. From director Sean Gandini’s opening chat with the audience, where his wife and co-founder Kati Ylä-Hokkala demonstrates the basics of juggling’s art, he has us listening to movement, tracking rhythm and metre as leather balls fly and land with satisfying thump. Cunningham’s choreography asks us to do exactly the same thing – listen to movement, watch rhythms unfold in the body – and there’s a beautiful synergy between the two forms.  Life was created with Cunningham dancer Jennifer Goggans – she makes her juggling debut – and the multi-talented performers slide and bend into Cunningham’s stark geometries, reinterpreting sections from the likes of CRWDSPCR and Split Sides. It all becomes ultra-complicated, the performers coordinating juggling rhythms, arm and leg sequences at the same time, catching balls while in deep pliés or balancing in arabesque. Watching them master these tricksy puzzles is immensely pleasing, but despite the complexity there’s something very pure about it, magnanimous, even. They expand into tossing rings and clubs in the air while composer Caroline Shaw layers up vocal and string sounds in a live score that’s adjacent to the action rather than related to it – although there are some serendipitous moments – all of which is very much in Cunningham’s spirit. You can imagine the ever-curious choreographer would have loved this little gem of a show.

1/13/2022,"Fabled Shore is Rose Macaulay’s account of her journey in 1949, alone and by car, round the coast of Iberia from Catalonia to the Algarve. She found dire poverty and the Spain she describes, still reeling from civil war, is unrecognisable to us now. Today’s tourist hotspots were then empty, pristine beaches with ramshackle houses, sometimes only with a barn to sleep in, and curious children who clustered round this strange creature – a foreign woman travelling alone by car. The prose is full of beautiful descriptions, with a very funny account of what she found in Gibraltar. Strange to think that there are people still alive who remember that time. Read this, and weep.Barbara Forbes  Arabia: Through the Looking Glass by Jonathan Raban was published in 1979. The author visited the Middle East before the vast wealth of the 1970s oil boom damaged Arab culture and traditions. Raban’s gregarious nature and the chatty eloquence of his writing reveals the hidden depths of the people he encounters. You’re pulled into conversations with expats and Bedouins with equal intensity. As a young child, I spent two years living in Saudi Arabia during the exact time of Raban’s research. This book allowed me to experience the entire region with an adult’s insight, wit and well-crafted observations.Emma Russell I promised my eldest that I wouldn’t book another holiday in Scotland this year … but that was before I read Helen Ochyra’s Beyond the Bagpipes and now it’s going to take all my willpower not to book us another remote Scottish cottage. Beyond the Bagpipes charts the author’s journey around Scotland following her mother’s death and is a cliche-free and evocative portrait of the country. I found my own experiences of places like the “moulded seascape” of Uig Sands mirrored in Ochyra’s descriptions, while folding down page after page to mark all the places I still need to visit.Emma The incomparable Venice by Jan Morris is a love letter to a city that still exists behind the superficial hustle and bustle of mass tourism: a place of unique character, breathtaking contrasts and the indomitable spirit of a grand inheritance. Venice transports me to the serene dusk of quiet alleyways and the ever-surprising emergence into bright, busy squares. It reminds me that the ancient city is a place for wanderers, rewarding those ready to stray from the well-worn tourist trails. Less a travel book, more a book that exhorts you to stay and take the time to know a place, a people and their history.Sarah One More Croissant for the Road by Felicity Cloake made me want to head out to a Parisian bakery as soon as I read it. A woman cycles around France in search of the perfect croissant while trying lots of French delicacies on the way. There are recipes, great mouthwatering descriptions of the food, fabulous descriptions of France experienced on two wheels and just a general love of travel and France across each and every page. Wonderful and really evocative of the taste, sights and smells of this diverse country. Fabulous.Claire Austin Vintage travel books hold a special place in my heart. The Flaneur: A Stroll through the Paradoxes of Paris by Edmund White is one such book. White draws on his 16 years’ experience as a resident between 1983 and 1998 and shows us a Paris full of contradictions. He guides us through a heady mix of elegant literary characters sharing ideas at bohemian cafes, while breathing life into the lives and experiences of some of the marginalised groups who call Paris their home. The Flaneur leaves you feeling entertained, just a little bit smarter and yearning to know more.Trudy Shard I like Down Under by Bill Bryson because the author never seems to use the same approach to each of his books. Is this book going to be snarky Bill? Is this going to be funny Bill? Is this going to be funny, yet informative Bill? Is this going to be snarky, yet informative Bill? I could go on, but my hands would start to cramp with the unlimited combinations. While many of the scientific discoveries outlined in the book were a little beyond me, I thoroughly enjoyed Bryson’s descriptions of the larger-than-life personalities behind the discoveries, which really brought the science described to life. Bill Bryson also loves Australia, and it shows.Aisha Khan Reading Full Tilt by Dervla Murphy showed me how far you could go by just turning the pedals on a bicycle (in her case, from Ireland to India). An open mind, a bucketful of resilience and a deep respect for all those she met just added to the joy of adventure. It took a while between reading the book in my 20s and then pedalling myself east to west and north to south across the US in my 50s, but she has been with me the whole way, even laughing on my shoulder whenever it felt a bit tough, to spur me on.Debbie Carr  Guardian Travel readers' tips Every week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

It’s about the kindness of strangers to outsiders based on the help Newby himself received from local families and peasants as an escaped prisoner during the second world war. Struggling with a broken ankle, Newby was hidden in a hay loft for months and eventually met his future wife, Wanda. They exchange Italian and English lessons, learning about each other’s cultures and background all while evading enemy soldiers.

1/13/2022,"Hamish is a rich and successful entrepreneur, a man who seems to be winning at life. Yet secretly, he is falling apart. His second wife has left him, he’s stressed out of his mind and he has just mournfully realised that no matter how many trophy girlfriends or French chateaux he acquires, some other millionaire will always have a better one.  If you hate Hamish already, then you may be missing the broader lesson of this book, which is that unhappy working lives are just as complex and fascinating as the unhappy private lives they frequently mirror, and also just as deserving of attention. Hamish, it turns out, is now a happy social entrepreneur with an admirable sideline mentoring former care leavers and ex-prisoners into work. Jenny Rogers is a work coach, one of those professions that arouses instant scepticism in some, although the absorbing case studies she has collected in Are You Listening? suggest she is really more of an office shrink. The high-flying executives she is hired to help invariably start off presenting dry corporate dilemmas, but soon end up weepily confessing to some childhood trauma or hidden vulnerability, which turns out to be what is really driving their behaviour in the office. Time and time again, it becomes clear that the emotional baggage most people carry doesn’t just affect intimate relationships. Many of us end up lugging it into work, and dumping it on our colleagues, too. Her book is resolutely not a self-help manual for those in a difficult professional situation, although reading it may make you slightly more likely to identify the resident office psychopath. And while it contains some universal themes, Rogers’s generally well-heeled clients may not be all that relatable to the average office worker. But the stories are intriguing, told well enough to draw the reader in, and en masse contain some shrewd truths. The overall effect is rather like a middle management version of the psychoanalyst Stephen Grosz’s The Examined Life, which distilled a lifetime’s worth of conversations on the couch. If Rogers seems at times overly keen to highlight parallels between coaching and psychotherapy, that perhaps comes from a lifetime of people snorting in disbelief (as Hamish initially does) that “people actually pay you money for this”. But the sensitive process she describes seems worth taking seriously, not least for anyone who has experienced the profound daily misery that a bullying boss or dysfunctional team can cause. It’s also a useful reminder both that tricky colleagues may privately be grappling with more than meets the eye, and that ultimately it’s people that make a workplace tick. Managers sometimes criticise younger staff for wanting to bring what millennials call their “whole selves”, and previous generations might call “messy personal stuff”, to work. What this book elegantly exposes, however, is that there’s really no such thing as keeping it “strictly business”; that somewhere beneath even the stiffest of corporate stuffed shirts, there beats some semblance of a heart.

1/13/2022,"The American Red Cross has declared a “national blood crisis” as the US faces its worst blood shortage in over a decade, predominantly due to a drop in blood drives as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. “In recent weeks, blood centers across the country have reported less than a one-day’s supply of blood of certain critical blood types – a dangerously low level. If the nation’s blood supply does not stabilize soon, life-saving blood may not be available for some patients when it is needed,” the Red Cross said in a joint statement with America’s Blood Centers and the Association for the Advancement of Blood and Biotherapies.  Since March 2020, there has been a 10% overall blood donation decline across the nation. The pandemic has contributed to a 62% drop in blood drives across schools and colleges. A surge in Covid-19 cases as well as winter storms have disrupted blood donation processes. “As these concerns compound, blood centers nationwide continue to face a decline in donor turnout, blood drive cancellations, staffing challenges and donor eligibility misinformation,” the statement said. As a result of the shortage, the Red Cross, which supplies 40% of the country’s blood supply, has had to limit blood product distributions to hospitals. According to the organization, some hospitals may not receive one in four blood products they need. Doctors have been forced to make difficult decisions about who receives blood transfusions and who will be required to wait until more blood products become available. The Red Cross has urged donors of all blood types – particularly type O – to make appointments now to donate in the coming weeks. It said that people who have received a US-authorized Covid-19 vaccine, including those from Johnson & Johnson, Moderna and Pfizer, can donate blood and platelets, so long as they have no symptoms and feel well. Meanwhile, the Red Cross and the National Football League have partnered up for National Blood Donor Month in efforts to encourage individuals to donate blood and platelets. According to the Red Cross, those who came to give blood, platelets or plasma in January will have a chance to win a trip to Super Bowl LVI in Los Angeles in February. Those who donate could also win a home theater package and a $500 e-gift card.

1/13/2022,"You start the day with the best intentions, determined to be productive and efficient. Yet, before you’ve even had your mid-morning coffee, you’re derailed by a chaotic procession of interruptions, distractions and poor project management. Before you know it, you are stressed, tired and brain fog has descended. But don’t worry – help is at hand. Dr Sahar Yousef, a leading expert on productivity and cognitive neuroscientist at the University of California, Berkeley’s Haas School of Business, has partnered with the work management company Asana to offer expert tips on how to improve your concentration and efficiency at work.  Treat emails as laundryMany workers feel pressure to respond to emails and other messages immediately, but this constant monitoring comes at a cost. It can take as long as 25 minutes to regain momentum after an interruption, so Yousef says we should treat email, texts, and other chat tools like we would laundry. “Let messages build up and then do a ‘load’ every one or two hours, as opposed to having everything always accessible and trying to process in real-time,” she says. Schedule focus timeYousef says a major enemy of concentration while working is “context switching”. This happens when you suddenly shift your attention to a different context, such as when you interrupt what you’re working on to join an unexpected call, or to respond to a message about an unrelated project. “Every time we switch tasks, we pay a fine in terms of both time and energy,” says Yousef. “And by energy, I mean our brains literally need blood glucose and oxygen to perform the switch”. So, instead of switching between different tasks throughout the day, schedule dedicated time to focus on one specific project. Two good ways of doing this are timeboxing and time-blocking. With timeboxing, you estimate the amount of time a task will take and dedicate a certain amount of time to complete it. During that time you should ignore all other tasks. Time-blocking is similar – but instead of boxing out time for a single task, you group similar tasks together and complete them all in one “time block”. For example, you might schedule a time block to answer your emails or to catch up on those nagging admin tasks. Plan virtual meetings betterOnline meetings have become much more common during the pandemic, but they aren’t always helpful. According to research by Asana, despite increased face time with colleagues through virtual meetings, teams have less clarity about what needs to be done and when. On top of that, Yousef says: “Video conferencing is actually physiologically more draining and requires more neurological effort to stay alert and maintain attention.” So make sure you approach your next video call carefully. First, you can consider if you actually need a meeting at all. If you do, then share an agenda and any materials ahead of the call, so that everyone is prepared. If you have a series of virtual meetings scheduled, make sure you take at least a few minutes’ break between each one, to help your brain reset. Yousef also suggests turning off self-view during video meetings, or cover the image of your face with a sticky note on your screen. She says that seeing your own face during a video call activates the part of your brain responsible for facial recognition and is an extra drain on your focus. Change default settings on hardwareThere has been an “explosion” in digital tools whose business models are based on getting you to look at their screen, says Yousef. These tools are naturally designed to be “as addictive as possible and to hijack your attention away from the present moment”. So if you have chat windows open, and notifications switched on for emails, messengers and social media, you’re going to have a tough time concentrating. Close any programs you do not need open and switch off notifications on as many apps as possible. “Until we push back and don’t accept the default settings, these technologies will continue to make it difficult to focus for long periods of time,” says Yousef. Create triggers to help focusHaving trouble concentrating? Try using cognitive associations to let your brain know it’s time to focus. You might want to clear your desk before you start work, or light a candle or listen to a specific type of music while you’re at your desk. If you work from home, wearing specific clothes for work can also act as a helpful trigger. “Our brains rely on cognitive associations to help us figure out what is appropriate – and inappropriate – behaviour in a certain situation and to save us time and energy,” says Yousef. “If, for example, we have clear associations between our work environment and getting into a ‘focus mode’, whenever we enter that work environment specific neural networks fire and our brain knows what to do.” Find out more about how companies, teams and individuals can thrive by taking a look at Asana’s Anatomy of Work Index 2021",Reimagining work,‘Treat your email like laundry’: five ways to work smarter,https://www.theguardian.com/reimagining-work/2022/jan/13/treat-your-email-like-laundry-five-ways-to-work-smarter
1/13/2022,"Persimmon has reported a bumper year with weekly sales up a fifth in the second half of 2021 compared with pre-pandemic levels thanks to a booming housing market driven by cheap mortgage deals and a stamp duty holiday. The UK’s biggest housebuilder by market value said in a trading update that revenues rose 8.4% last year to £3.61bn as it completed the sale of 14,551 homes, up almost 1,000 on 2020, as the average price of a home rose from £230,534 to £237,050 year-on-year.  However, Persimmon said the spread of the Omicron variant has increased sickness-related absenteeism, with some customers delaying moving into new homes to follow government isolation advice. Stamp duty land tax, its proper name, is a tax paid by someone who purchases a property or piece of land in England or Northern Ireland – Scotland and Wales have their own systems. The tax is paid when the sale is completed and is based on the sum paid. Prior to Rishi Sunak's July 2020 financial statement, there were two different points at which stamp duty was payable, depending on whether you were a first-time buyer or a mover. For movers, stamp duty had to be paid on any property costing more than £125,000. For first-time buyers there was no stamp duty to pay unless a property cost more than £300,000. If your first home cost more than £500,000 you paid the same as a mover but if it cost less than that, you only paid tax on the part of the price that fell between £300,000 and £500,000. The starting threshold will now be increased to £500,000 on all sales taking place before 31 March 2021. The starting rate above £500,000 will be 5% and will apply to the part of the sale up to £925,000. The change will apply to second homes and additional properties. They attract a 3% surcharge, and this will still be in place, but buying property will now be cheaper for landlords. Hilary Osborne “Whilst the industry continues to face the ongoing operational and economic challenges as a consequence of the pandemic, particularly as the Omicron outbreak unfolded in the last six weeks of the year, the group continues to manage these ongoing challenges comprehensively,” said Dean Finch, chief executive at Persimmon. “The long-term fundamentals of the UK housing market remain strong and I am confident.” The company responded to government plans to force housebuilders to pay to fix defective cladding following the Grenfell fire, although Persimmon said it had built only a “very small proportion” of buildings affected. “We share the secretary of state’s aspiration that leaseholders should not have to pay to remove cladding,” the company said. “Indeed, we made a commitment a year ago that leaseholders in buildings constructed by Persimmon, including all those above 11 metres, should not have to cover the cost of cladding removal. We have constructed only a very small proportion of buildings affected by this issue. In common with the rest of the housebuilding industry, we will shortly begin paying the cladding levy announced in the budget.” The company has previously said that 26 of the buildings it has constructed have been found to have defective cladding. Along with its peers, the FTSE 100 company has benefited from the UK’s pandemic-fuelled housing boom as homebuyers sought to exploit the government’s stamp duty holiday, which ended last October, historically low borrowing costs and the “race for space” trend as the rise in flexible and remote working fuelled a rise in buyers seeking at properties in more rural and picturesque locations. Persimmon said that homebuying enquiries have “remained encouraging” despite the end of government support schemes, with demand continuing to outstrip supply. However, the company said its £1.62bn order book at 31 December is slightly down on 2020’s £1.69bn, although it’s up on 2019’s £1.36bn.",News/Business,Persimmon reports bumper year amid UK housing market boom,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/13/persimmon-reports-bumper-year-amid-uk-housing-market-boom
1/13/2022,"The temperature was below freezing but Alexis Sánchez kept shedding layers: first his match jersey and then his thermals, until he stood bare-chested under the Curva. It was as though he wanted everyone at San Siro to see him, to know he was still here, still in peak physical condition, still, as he described himself in a post-game interview, “a monster”. He had delivered the evidence that Inter supporters really wanted moments before, when he muscled past Daniele Rugani on the edge of the Juventus six-yard box and swept the ball into the bottom corner of their goal. It was the deciding act of this year’s Supercoppa, putting his team 2-1 up in the 121st minute.  ALEXIS SANCHEZ!!! 😱😱😱Inter win it at the death! The Supercoppa belongs to the Nerazzurri! 🔵⚫ pic.twitter.com/2O29cvgJv3 Here was the first trophy of Simone Inzaghi’s tenure as manager, confirmation of their status as Italian football’s top dog despite the departure of Antonio Conte last summer. They had not lifted this trophy since 2010, the year they won the treble. To reclaim it in such dramatic fashion, with the latest goal ever scored in this fixture and against the rival who dominated the decade in between, could only feel even sweeter. It had been a nervous evening. Inter controlled the tempo, finishing with more than 60% of the possession and three times as many shots as their opponents. They played with the authority of a team that sits top of Serie A, boasting an 11-point advantage over Juventus as well as a game in hand. Yet they also conceded the first goal and, even after equalising, were held in a stalemate for almost 90 minutes. Juventus were missing several starters – from Wojciech Szczęsny to Leonardo Bonucci, Juan Cuadrado and Federico Chiesa – but defended from the front with Federico Bernardeschi and Weston McKennie on the flanks behind Álvaro Morata. Dejan Kulusevski was assigned to get under Marcelo Brozovic’s feet in the middle. It was McKennie who opened the scoring, converting Morata’s cross with a close-range header, but Juventus’s advantage was short-lived. Edin Dzeko got in front of Mattia De Sciglio, and the defender went through his heel. Lautaro Martínez converted the penalty. Inter always seemed the likelier winners thereafter, but clear-cut chances were few and far between. Denzel Dumfries saw a header pushed on to the bar and Dzeko narrowly failed to apply a finish to a cross from the same player, but that was about it. Then Inzaghi made a surprising choice, substituting the Bosnian forward and Martínez together in the 75th minute, sending on Sánchez and Joaquín Correa. If Inter had failed to win, this would have been cited as their manager’s great mistake. Dzeko has been integral to the team’s style under Inzaghi, his hold-up play and calm redistribution allowing the Nerazzurri to adapt away from the fast-break football they played under Conte to a more possession-based approach. His withdrawal seemed to further blunt an Inter attack that was already struggling to carve out openings; Sánchez sent a header just wide from a corner at the start of extra-time, but that was it. Juventus were playing for penalties and as time ticked down, Bonucci stripped out of his tracksuit ready to come on and take one. But Sánchez scored before the Juventus defender could make it to the pitch. A share of the credit belonged to Matteo Darmian, who pounced to intercept after Federico Dimarco’s cross was chested awkwardly by Juventus’s Alex Sandro. The ball looped up over Giorgio Chiellini and Sánchez was on it in a flash, finishing at the near post. It was a goal to vindicate a player who feels he has been underused at Inter, starting only four Serie A games this season. “This is how champions are,” he told his Mediaset interviewer at full-time. “Champions do things that others don’t. The more that champions play, the better they are … I am like a lion in a cage, if they let me play I am a monster.” Time will tell whether this moment can be a turning point. Sánchez’s contract runs to 2023, but it contains a clause allowing the club to buy him out for around €4m this summer. Previous reports in Milan suggested that they were strongly considering the option. More goals like this one may provoke a rethink. Either way, he has written his name into club history. The Supercoppa might not be the most important piece of silverware that Inter were aiming for this season but it was the first piece available. Claiming it was an important step for a team that is at once starting a new cycle under Inzaghi and seeking to build on what they achieved under Conte: proving that their first Scudetto in 11 years was no fluke. It is easy to forget now, but few people had them listed as favourites to win anything in the summer. The departures of Conte, Romelu Lukaku and Achraf Hakimi were widely perceived as the dismantling of a project. Massimiliano Allegri’s return to Juventus, meanwhile, was expected to restore the Bianconeri as frontrunners. The Supercoppa confirmed what we have learned since: that Inzaghi was an inspired appointment, capable of not just maintaining Inter but evolving them into something different. Only a prisoner of the moment could perceive Dzeko as a stronger option up front than Lukaku, Serie A’s second-highest scorer and assist provider last season, but the manager has adapted his team to get the very best out of the Bosnian as well as others around him: Hakan Calhanoglu has thrived since arriving from Milan and at 32, Ivan Perisic looks the sharpest he has in years. Greater tests lie ahead. Inzaghi won the Supercoppa twice at Lazio, too, as well as a Coppa Italia. Wednesday’s win made him the first manager ever to beat Juventus in three finals, but he would not have walked away from his beloved Biancocelesti last summer for anything less than the pursuit of a Serie A title. Still, Wednesday’s game mattered. You could see it in Sánchez’s celebration and the impotent fury of Bonucci, launching himself into a physical confrontation with Inter’s team secretary, Cristiano Mozzillo, on the touchline. You could hear it in Inzaghi’s own voice, cracking and failing in post-game interviews after a night of too much yelling. “We wanted this trophy,” he said, reminding his interviewer of the 11-year gap since Inter last won it. “That’s too long,” he insisted, “for a team with so much potential.”",Sport/Football,‘I am a monster’: Alexis Sánchez unleashed to win Supercoppa for Inter,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/13/alexis-sanchez-unleashed-to-win-supercoppa-for-inter-juventus
1/13/2022,"It was easy to scoff at the initial reports that University of Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh was considering a return to the NFL. In the normal cause of business, it looked like a well-timed (if obvious) leak on the heels of a successful season, a college coach looking to maximize his value and extract maximum dollars and influence out his school.  Not so fast. At this stage, Harbaugh returning to the NFL feels like a fait accompli. He has been linked with all of the head coach openings that have trickled out of the league this week, and has yet to issue any public denials that he’s looking to leave Ann Arbor. In case you’re in need of a quick refresher on Harbaugh’s time at Michigan: He returned to his alma mater as a conquering hero, a former Wolverines quarterback who turned into one of the most successful coaches – in college and the pros – of the 2010s; he had a reputation for heading to places that stunk and immediately making them great; he had previously taken the 49ers to within a play of winning the Super Bowl; things turned sour over the Niners potential rebuild; he was in high demand in the NFL; he rebuffed interest in favor of returning to his school. In his first couple of years back at school, Michigan were good but not good enough. Then they stunk. Then Harbaugh, at one time the highest-paid coach in the country, took a meaty pay cut. Then Michigan became really good, finally toppling bitter rivals Ohio State and making it to a first college football playoff – where they were boat-raced by eventual national champions Georgia. In the abstract, a coach beating the once-unconquerable rival and making it into the postseason would signal the start of something. For Harbaugh and Michigan, it seems like the end. Harbaugh’s anticipated return to the NFL – be it with the Bears, Raiders, Dolphins, Giants, or any of the open positions that have interest in the coach – is about more than one coach, one college, and one NFL team. It’s about a shift in the landscape of coaching at the highest level. There was a time when college coaching jobs ranked as the best in the country. Sure, college coaches would bounce up to the next level to test themselves, as much an ego play as anything else – a chance to see if they could really coach against the best of the best. But the expectations, the short tenures, the salary cap, the draft meant sustained success was difficult. Parity is legislated in the NFL; it’s equality by design. In college, the rich have always gotten richer. You recruit well. So you win. So you recruit even better. So you win even bigger. On and on the cycle rolls. Coaches were apt to stay where they could rack up wins and champions and accrue ever-increasing amounts of power. In the NFL, teams are designated one first-round pick a year. At the blueblood college programs, they’re consistently pulling in two or three future first-round picks a year in high-school recruiting, with a gaggle of second and third-round picks filling out the roster. In the good old days, once you had established a program, the thing could sit on cruise control for close to a decade; the season coming down to one or two games at the end. But times they are a-changin’. Athletes at the college level have been given some agency. Now, the playing body has some power. Athletes are now free to transfer schools, one time, penalty-free. They’re able to put their name in the ‘transfer portal’, to let other schools know they’re available and open for business. And it is indeed a business. The advent of Name Image and Likeness (NIL) in all its unregulated glory has led to a recruiting arms race. What was once covert is now overt: players are being paid full-time salaries to play collegiate football. The mechanics are goofy. Coaches cannot outright recruit a player based on NIL. A booster must set up an LLC and ‘license’ a player’s (or whole position groups) image. Still: The implications have been immediate and gravity-altering. Bringing payments out of the shadows is what allowed Jackson State, an HBCU in college football’s second division, to attract the No 1 overall recruit in the country. The traditional powers continue to hoover up the majority of the talent, but the playing field has been democratized. If your school has a wealthy backer willing to hand over dollars to college students, you’re in The Game. Those jigsaw pieces taken together have changed the structure of the sport. Alabama built a dynastic program on principle that it was ‘fourth-and-goal every day’. Now, it’s free agency every day. A college coach is no longer spending whatever free time he can muster firing off texts to teenagers or flying across the country to check out the next biggest thing. He is re-recruiting the players already in his building. There is no legislation that could stop Bryce Young, the reigning Heisman Trophy winner, from putting his name into the transfer portal tomorrow. He could offer his services to the highest bidder at the click of a button. That may be Alabama, it may not. The power that schools and the coaches that govern those schools once held over the players, their future NFL prospects and earning power, has eroded. The players gaining a modicum of power has loosened the grip of once dictatorial coaches. Every conversation, every decision is a recruiting pitch. Bench a player for his backup, he’s gone. Unable to pony up the NIL deal commensurate with your lineman’s value? He’ll see you at the class reunion. There’s a reason Nick Saban is suddenly all smiles; the talent will go where it’s fun and they pay. It will require a different style of coach moving forward, a different mindset. When asked about whether he had ever dreamed about taking the Miami job, new head coach Mario Cristobal, widely considered the nation’s top recruiter, shot back: “I don’t have time for dreams”. There was not a hint of jest in his voice. He was serious. Why take time for things such as sleep when there’s another deal to be struck with a three-star cornerback in Boca Raton? While you’re dreaming, Cristobal is ‘crootin. Once upon a time, with four-year scholarships and coaches able to block transfer requests from their athletes, a college coach could build for the long-term. It was the NFL that was a place that demanded immediate results. Now, college football is the place of upheaval; the NFL is where a coach can find some stasis. Sure, since the NFL expanded its playoff field 11 teams have failed to make the playoffs and 10 of those sides have made coaching changes (not strictly for on-field reasons). But – ah – guaranteed contracts; a set number of draft picks; a salary cap; the chance to sign your quarterback to a deal that means he cannot up and leave for a bigger offer in eight months’ time. No coach goes into a job assuming they’re going to fail. They think they’re going to succeed. And if you think you’re going to hit – that you can out-scheme opponents and find the talent needed to win – the NFL now offers an advantage over the college game. When you get done with work, you’re done with work. Player movement doesn’t really begin until the offseason – and it’s regulated. Those TikTok dances you’ve had to do in an 18-year-olds living? They’re out. Sleeping over at a kicker’s house to fend off your recruiting rivals? They’re gone, too. Team-building is streamlined. There are no backroom dealings with boosters. There have always been extremes between the college and professional ranks. It’s why so many of college football’s superstar coaches have flamed out in the pros. The broad outline was the same but the nitty-gritty required different skill sets. That divide is now growing. Those who could stomach the old way of doing things — their way of doing things – will soon start running for the hills now that the players have a say. One game requires a fresh skillset; the other a different entirely. Harbaugh will be the first to jump from the new lifestyle because he has the pedigree to do so. And while college coaches have had rough records when jumping to the pros before, that won’t stop NFL owners from offering big-time deals to try to lure away the next hot candidate. Now more than ever, they will listen.",Sport/Sport,Jim Harbaugh’s likely NFL return shows college isn’t what it used to be,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/13/jim-harbaugh-nfl-comeback-rumors
