2/16/2022,"Authorities are monitoring parts of the north Wales coast for an oil slick, after hydrocarbons were released into the sea following a pipeline failure. The pipeline, which connects two oil installations in the Irish Sea, suffered a failure about 33km (20.5 miles) from the north Wales coast. According to Eni UK, the company which operates the pipeline, the incident – which involved “less than 500 barrels” – was reported on Monday.  The UK subsidiary of the Italian energy giant Eni confirmed that hydrocarbons had been released from its pipeline running between Conwy and Douglas oil installations, sparking fears of an oil slick. In a statement it said: “Eni UK Ltd can confirm that a release of hydrocarbons from its pipeline between the Conwy and Douglas installations, approximately 33km from the north Wales coast, was reported on Monday 14 February.” It said the details of the incident are still being confirmed, but the “Conwy to Douglas line was shut immediately and remains off”. “All relevant authorities were promptly informed. There was no impact at any personnel on the installations. A further statement will be made as soon as more information becomes available,” it continued. A spokesperson for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency said: “The Maritime and Coastguard Agency’s counter pollution and salvage team, together with the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy’s (BEIS) offshore petroleum regulator for environment and decommissioning team and the secretary of state’s representative, are monitoring the response of Eni UK and assisting partner local authorities in an ongoing response to an incident, which was first reported off the north Wales coast yesterday (14 February).” News of the spill has come exactly 26 years to the day of what has been called Wales’ worst ecological disaster, when 72,000 tonnes of crude spilled from the Sea Empress oil tanker off the Pembrokeshire coast. Large numbers of seaweeds and invertebrates were killed on the beaches where it drifted ashore, and it took over a year to clean the slick. Doug Parr, chief scientist for Greenpeace UK, said: “This week marks the anniversary of the Sea Empress oil spill. A quarter of a century on, we still find that oil is a dirty business at every stage, whether that’s through planet-warming emissions or leakages like this that harm marine life. The ongoing environmental damage oil causes should be a major incentive to drive forward the cleaner, cheaper energy technologies that now exist.” Dr Richard Benwell, CEO of Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: “It’s 26 years to the day since the Sea Empress disaster wrought ecological havoc on the Welsh coast … Fossil fuel spills are again threatening the wildlife in our waters, which are already in a precarious state. The sooner we break our dependence on these dirty fuels the better.”",News/UK news,North Wales coast is monitored after oil pipeline spillage,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/15/north-wales-coast-is-monitored-after-oil-pipeline-spillage
2/16/2022,"Andriy, a 34-year-old bank clerk living in Kyiv, was feeling very pleased with the announcement on Tuesday that some Russian troops had started to move away from the border with Ukraine. First, it seemed to lower the threat of an all-out Russian attack on Kyiv. And second, it meant he might win a bet with his sister.  Most locals are going about their lives as normal. “She took a plane to Poland on Saturday with her kids because she was reading about all this war threat, but I didn’t believe in it, and also I wanted to stay because had a haircut booked,” he said, as he took a stroll in the sunshine on the central Khreshchatyk street on Tuesday afternoon. “We had a bet about whether the Russians would attack,” he said. In recent days, many Kyiv residents, while alarmed by the military buildup, have shared Andriy’s scepticism about American warnings that their lives were about to be disrupted by missile barrages and that tank incursions would come to pass. The reports of US diplomats destroying equipment and shredding documents at the embassy in Kyiv before fleeing the capital, reminiscent of desperate scrambles to evacuate burning cities on the brink of capture, have sat strangely with the atmosphere of calm in most of the Ukrainian capital over recent days. On Monday evening, bars and restaurants were full of couples enjoying Valentine’s Day dates. During the day on Tuesday, the streets were busy with people going about their daily business. “Kyiv is calm. National currency stable. Restaurants and supermarkets full. The absence of diplomats is compensated by abundance of journalists,” wrote Olexander Scherba, a former Ukrainian diplomat, on Twitter. Indeed, the world’s newspaper and television crews have descended on Kyiv in recent weeks, awaiting the Russian assault threatened by Putin’s massed troops and promised by White House briefings. The Russian announcement on Tuesday that some troops were being withdrawn from the border appeared to make that maximal outcome less likely, though the Ukrainian government is not relaxing yet. Foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter: “We in Ukraine have a rule: we don’t believe what we hear, we believe what we see. If a real withdrawal follows these statements, we will believe in the beginning of a real de-escalation.” But even if the withdrawal does continue, news on Tuesday evening of a potential hacking attack against several Ukrainian banks and the website of the ministry of defence was a reminder that Russia’s long, hybrid grind against Ukraine has been going on for some time and is likely to continue. This kind of messy, piecemeal attack is what Ukrainian leaders have always believed to be more likely than the all-out war scenario briefed by the White House. Underneath the calm of recent days, plenty of Kyiv residents have been making contingency plans, as local television news bulletins have drummed home the possibility of Russian action. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitaly Klitschko, said on Monday the city was working to ensure that power, heating and water supplies would be uninterrupted in the case of a military incursion. His administration released a map showing 4,500 possible bomb shelters for use in case of an attack on Kyiv. They included shops, bars, metro stations – and in one case, a strip club – all of which have promised to shelter people in the event of airstrikes. Some people have bought water and food supplies in case they get stuck at home for days. While many foreign diplomats have been sent home or evacuated to Lviv, in the west of the country, many foreign residents of Kyiv have decided to ignore apocalyptic warnings from their embassies to leave Ukraine immediately. “I’m staying for now, this is a massive city, even if the Russians do start something, I just can’t see it getting too dangerous to stay here,” said Bryan, a 48-year-old American businessman who has been living in Kyiv for the past four years. “I find it a bit strange that our diplomats fled so quickly. That embassy is like a fortress; surely they have somewhere secure to be there,” he added.",News/World news,Kyiv starts to breathe a little easier as Russian troops pull back,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/15/kyiv-starts-to-breathe-a-little-easier-as-russian-troops-pull-back
2/16/2022,"Uefa has been accused of exposing supporters to “crypto-mercenaries” after becoming the latest football organisation to sign a deal with the fan token company Socios.com. The European governing body has agreed a licensing and sponsorship arrangement with Socios.com, which produces tokens for 53 football clubs across the world, including Crystal Palace, Leeds United, Manchester City, Everton and Aston Villa.  Fan tokens allow supporters to vote on certain matters decided by a club and to enter competitions. They must be bought, using Socios.com’s cryptocurrency Chiliz, and can be traded on cryptocurrency markets. Football Supporters Europe was highly critical of the three-year agreement. “We are appalled by Uefa’s decision to team up with Socios, a company that monetises fan engagement at the expense of match-going fans,” it said in a statement. “This is an incomprehensible move at a time when football needs protection from crypto-mercenaries.” FSE, who receive funding from Uefa, continued: “Uefa’s partnership with Socios legitimises risky investments in highly volatile and largely unregulated financial assets.” Another respected fan organisation, SD Europe, was also critical of the deal, which it said came in “stark contrast” to Uefa’s decision on Monday to give 30,000 free tickets to match-going fans for the finals of this year’s continental club competitions. “Meaningful fan engagement should be democratic, inclusive and transparent via formal mechanisms such as supporter involvement in governance structures, share ownership, voting rights and representative supporter groups,” SD Europe said. Uefa was approached by the Guardian for comment. In a press release its marketing director, Guy-Laurent Epstein, said: “We are always looking for innovative partnerships, including with the growing cryptocurrency and blockchain-based fan engagement market. With rich experience working with some of the top sports organisations around the world, it is clear that partnering with Socios.com is an ideal fit.” As part of the arrangement with Uefa, Socios.com will produce “add-on fan tokens” with Uefa branding which will be awarded to customers currently holding tokens in clubs. A Socios.com spokesperson said uses for the add-on tokens would be disclosed soon but that they would not be sold to customers nor available for trade. Socios.com was founded by the former poker entrepreneur Alexandre Dreyfus and has become the market leader in linking sport to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Dreyfus says that fan tokens enable clubs to better interact with the digital aspects of their fanbase. “The value that is provided is not financial and will never be financial,” he told Sky News last month, “The value is about the experience and the connection that is provided between the fan and the club.” The link between fan tokens and speculative trading has been part of the Socios.com offering since its launch in 2019. Some tokens have seen substantial falls in value, with the Arsenal token losing 60% since its launch in November last year. In December the Advertising Standards Authority called the club “irresponsible” and “misleading” for the way they had marketed their token, saying they had “failed to illustrate the risk of the investment”.",Sport/Football,Fan group ‘appalled’ by Uefa deal with cryptocurrency company ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/15/uefa-deal-with-cryptocurrency-company-socios-fan-group-appalled
2/16/2022,"Russian lawmakers have passed a direct appeal to Vladimir Putin to recognise the Russian-controlled separatist states of Donetsk and Luhansk, providing a way to up the ante in the regional crisis without launching an attack on Ukraine. Putin has said he will not immediately recognise the so-called republics but he is likely to wield that option as a bargaining chip as he continues to demand security guarantees from the west.  The stage-managed manoeuvre unfolded on Tuesday as Putin also confirmed a “partial” withdrawal of Russian forces from the Ukrainian border, a decision that would reduce the potential for a war if it involves a large number of troops. It is not yet clear that it will. Since 2014, Russia has used the deadly Donbas conflict to divert attention from its annexation of Crimea and as part of its strategy to maintain control over Ukraine’s geopolitical future. The Minsk ceasefire deal signed in 2015 formalised a plan to reinsert the Donbas territories into Ukraine but give them a veto over Kyiv’s foreign policy choices, including potential accession to Nato. But the deal has stalled over ceasefire violations, disagreements about what steps to take first, and a growing belief in Ukraine that the deal was signed at gunpoint and is no longer politically viable. Hawkish officials and prominent figures in Russia such as the head of RT, Margarita Simonyan, have called for recognition of the regions’ independence. But that is far from a popular sentiment and would remove a key element of the Kremlin’s leverage over Ukraine by killing the Minsk deal. “The recognition of the LPR and DPR [Luhansk and Donetsk people’s republics] by Russia would signify its intentional withdrawal from the Minsk agreements,” a Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesperson said on Tuesday. Moscow has already made it difficult to reintegrate the territories by issuing hundreds of thousands of Russian passports there and arming and backing their governments since 2014. Still, a formal recognition of independence would be seen as a considerable escalation. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said recognition would be a “blatant violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty”. And some European officials have said it would trigger sanctions packages put together to deter a Russian invasion. “The call of Russia’s State Duma to recognise the occupied territories of Ukraine is an open escalation,” said Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania’s foreign minister. “Approval by Kremlin should be met with swift and decisive sanctions.” The decision may give Putin a way to save face from the crisis, after trying and so far failing to achieve guarantees that Nato will not admit Ukraine and will remove its infrastructure from countries that joined after 1997. Rather than starting a war, he could kick out the legs from under the ceasefire settlement and move troops into Donbas or even provoke a Ukrainian attack, giving Russia a casus belli. While Putin argued in his remarks that his deputies were “following public opinion”, it is clear that the Duma vote on Tuesday was largely managed by the Kremlin. As Putin noted, the decision for a partial withdrawal from the borders was directly tied to the vote on recognising the republics. One form of pressure on Ukraine was being swapped for another. At an impasse in negotiations with the west, Putin is threatening to demolish the status quo. It may mean Russia is considering other options besides war to achieve its goals, but it also signals the Kremlin is growing impatient. “Russia hears that Ukraine is not prepared to join Nato today, and we know this premise,” Putin said after talks with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. “And they say right away that it won’t be admitted tomorrow, but will be admitted when they prepare it for this. But this might be too late for us. Therefore, we want this issue to be settled now, right now, in the near future, through a negotiating process, by peaceful means.”",News/World news,Duma manoeuvre points to Kremlin impatience in Ukraine standoff,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/15/duma-manouevre-points-to-kremlin-impatience-in-ukraine-standoff
2/16/2022,"The shameful racial inequalities documented by the NHS Race and Health Observatory report (Radical action needed to tackle racial health inequality in NHS, says damning report, 14 February) have rightly led to calls for action. But what has been missed is that even in the last decade alone, there have been a myriad of NHS-led plans, strategies and initiatives to tackle inequality. Some, such as the workforce race equality standard, had investment of millions of pounds. Yet the comparatively poorer experiences of black, Asian and minority ethnic patients and workers persist. In understanding why, we must look at where accountability has gone. Almost every equality plan or initiative has had some form of oversight group. Almost always, these are led and dominated by the NHS, with race equality organisations such as ours often in a minority of one. With critical voices often ignored and regulators, such as the Equality and Human Rights Commission or Care Quality Commission, rarely acting when failures to progress racial equality are found, we are left with NHS leaders able to jump from one initiative to the next without any real change.  Unless we have accountability that is not led by the usual suspects and have regulators that are willing to act, the actions that follow this damning report will go the same way as in the past.Jabeer ButtChief executive, Race Equality Foundation  Your article highlights that the pandemic has had a disproportionate effect on minority ethnic groups. This certainly echoes our experience as ethnic minority health and social care professionals. It is imperative that this matter is not just included in the terms of reference in the Covid-19 inquiry this spring, but forms a central part of Lady Hallett’s investigations. We make this call with a clear-eyed view of the pressures on the 73-year-old NHS and with hope for what an inquiry could do. Our members, who include clinicians, researchers and ancillary workers, are facing these challenges daily – from the lack of appropriate PPE during the pandemic to the heavy losses among our ranks and our loved ones. The inquiry must make space to hear our unique perspectives on how health inequality is experienced in terms of race and ethnic origin as a matter of national importance.Ade AdeyemiSecretary, Federation of Ethnic Minority Healthcare Organisations  The NHS Race and Health Observatory report is incredibly important and action needs to be taken now at all levels. C3 Collaborating for Health has been working for a decade to highlight the burden of ill health and premature mortality from the main chronic diseases (cancer, diabetes, heart disease, stroke) that occur disproportionately in minority populations – the same issues led to the high rates of death and serious illness from Covid-19. With the support of the Burdett Trust for Nursing, we will be working with nurses of black or Asian heritage who can engage with their local communities and improve health outcomes among minority ethnic patients. The “radical action” called for in the report needs to be addressed by better support for disadvantaged patients and for the key staff who can play a major part in the changes that are needed.Christine HancockFounder, C3 Collaborating for Health; former general secretary, Royal College of Nursing  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2/16/2022,"Your editorial (8 February) criticising the draft police bill for further marginalising the already isolated Traveller community is both timeous and accurate. Rather than continued reliance within the bill on the sledgehammer approach of moving the problem of unauthorised encampments from one area to another – a proven costly failure – both central and local governments should look to replicate small successes from the past. In the 1980s and 90s, Strathclyde regional council, in partnership with central government, the 19 constituent district councils and representatives of the Traveller community, developed a network of serviced authorised sites for Traveller use across the region, the costs of which were shared by all councils, whether or not they actually hosted a site.  While such an innovative policy required sustained political commitment, and on occasion created controversy and friction, it was broadly successful in ensuring the availability of secure accommodation for a persecuted minority, while at the same time enhancing knowledge and understanding between the Traveller and settled communities.Phil MurrayLinlithgow, West Lothian  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Perhaps she has not come across the review by Julian Markels in Shakespeare Quarterly (1 April 1961), in which Markels dismisses Grebanier’s book as “garrulous and incoherent”, characterises its methodology as “irresponsible” and goes on to imply that Grebanier has, in any case, merely rewritten the work of an academic predecessor.Michael PykeShenstone, Staffordshire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2/16/2022,"Americans lost more than $1bn in 2021 alone to “romance scams” such as the one documented in the hit Netflix documentary The Tinder Swindler, according to the FBI.  The majority of the victims who were cheated out of their money were women older than 40, and women who are widowed, divorced, elderly or disabled, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) said in a press statement last week. Scammers often use poetry, flowers and other gifts to charm their victims, while keeping them concerned with stories of severe life circumstances, tragedies, death and injuries. “The criminals spend hours honing their skills, relying on well-rehearsed scripts that have been used repeatedly and successfully, and sometimes keep journals on their victims to better understand how to manipulate and exploit them,” the FBI said. “In some cases, victims may be recruited, unknowingly, to transfer illegally on behalf of others.” In 2020, there were approximately 24,000 complaints filed to IC3 that were categorized as romance scams, nearly 4,300 more than the previous year. The estimated losses in 2020 totaled approximately $605m – though the real figure is likely to be higher, given many victims feel too embarrassed, ashamed or humiliated to report being taken advantage of. Perhaps the most notable recent example of romance scams is the Tinder Swindler, the moniker given to the Israeli-born Simon Leviev, who pretended to be the son of a billionaire diamond dealer and defrauded unsuspecting women on dating apps of an estimated $10m. “Most often these scammers leave victims financially and emotionally devastated. Many victims may not have the ability to recover from the financial loss,” said Luis Quesada, special agent in charge of the FBI El Paso division. A study released last year by the cyber protection agency Malwarebytes revealed that people with less digital literacy are more prone to such scams. Those typically include ethnic minorities, women and older people, according to Malwarebytes. The FBI has offered tips on how to protect yourself online against potential abusers, including researching the person’s photo and profile to see if their images or details have been used elsewhere, being judicious about how much personal information you post – a “good scammer can turn a tiny bit of detail into a very effective punch”, the agency said – and never helping anyone move money, lest you become an unwitting money mule. “While we recognize that it may be embarrassing for victims to report this type of fraud, it’s important to do so, so that the FBI and our law enforcement partners can do everything in our power to ensure these online imposters are held accountable,” said Quesada.",News/US news,"Americans lost $1bn to Tinder-Swindler style romance cons last year, FBI says",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/15/tinder-swindler-americans-romance-scam-con-fbi
2/16/2022,"Fans of the original Star Wars trilogy, your time is up. Remember when you knew that the one true set of works based in a galaxy far, far away were the ones about Luke Skywalker? That the dreadful Attack of the Clones couldn’t be held up to The Empire Strikes Back? And that just thinking about Jar Jar Binks and Jake Lloyd’s acting was enough to make a million voices cry out in terror? Bad news: if you think like that, then when it comes to TV, Star Wars is no longer for you. Disney+ has confirmed that 25 May will be the launch date of its new Star Wars spin-off series: Obi-Wan Kenobi. After the announcement, Ewan McGregor – who reprises his role from the prequel trilogy of the late 90s and early 00s – explained who this show is being made for.  “People in their late teens or early 20s, those people who were kids who we made those films for, they loved them,” he told Forbes. “To them, they’re their Star Wars films, you know? For us, it was the original films of the 70s, but for them, it was our films were their Star Wars. So to step back into his shoes again now and do a series, a whole series about Obi-Wan Kenobi for those fans, it just makes me really happy.” That this is the show’s target audience probably shouldn’t come as a surprise, given that the Disney+ series directly follows on from Episode III – Revenge of the Sith, and takes place at a point where McGregor is yet to become Sir Alec Guinness. But the actor’s words confirm something that has seemed increasingly obvious to watchers of The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett: Star Wars really isn’t aimed at diehard fans of the original trilogy any more. It’s not just that Disney+’s Star Wars series are created with a younger generation in mind, they’re also clearly created for those who have followed post-prequel content like the animated shows, novels and comics. They’re full of nerd-pleasing references to what I’m going to call “New Star Wars”, which expands on events hinted at in the original trilogy and introduces a raft of new characters. Unless you’d followed the animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars or Star Wars Rebels, to watch The Book of Boba Fett was to find yourself repeatedly asking things like: “When did that pointy black lightsaber become a thing? What does this Ahsoka person have to do with anything? And who the hell is Cad Bane, and why does he look like an alien Clint Eastwood?” Given its target audience and the period in which it’s set, the Obi-Wan series is likely to feature its fair share of references like this. Is absolutely everyone aware that Darth Maul was glued back together after being lopped in half and definitely killed in The Phantom Menace? If you were confused by his cameo in 2018’s Solo, prepare for further befuddlement. What’s ironic about Star Wars targeting younger audiences, though, is that about 87% of the franchise’s appeal comes from pure nostalgia. No matter how much additional material is introduced, fans new and old will always be drawn in by images of Darth Vader, the Millennium Falcon and Luke Skywalker doing a flip while wearing Yoda as a backpack. But it’s a more recent form of nostalgia Disney+ is increasingly targeting: nostalgia for the prequels and the immediate content that followed. Many will be delighted to see that Hayden Christensen is back as Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader for Obi-Wan Kenobi – even if his face is covered by a black helmet most of the time. They’ll also be eager to spend more time with McGregor’s Obi-Wan, who, in fairness, alongside Ian McDiarmid’s Chancellor Palpatine/Darth Sidious, was one of the best things about the prequels. Is it a good idea to keep revisiting old characters and filling in the blanks, though? The real concern here is that this show will commit the same crime as The Book of Boba Fett: ruin an iconic character’s mystique and legacy by exploring a story that really didn’t need to be told. Do we really need to see what Obi-Wan got up to on Tatooine while watching over a baby Luke Skywalker? Presumably there was a lot of hanging around while trying not to look creepy. There will surely also be a bit that explains why Obi-Wan has no recollection of R2-D2 when he meets him in the original trilogy, despite spending a significant chunk of his life with the bin-shaped droid. A fan of New Star Wars would argue that this kind of continuity correction is reason enough for the show to exist. Others would happily go without. Like The Mandalorian, there will undoubtedly be plenty to enjoy about Obi-Wan Kenobi. If the thought of it being aimed at prequel-loving fans who need to explore every corner of the galaxy fills you with abject horror, though, you should probably temper your expectations now.",Arts/Television & radio,New Star Wars: how the TV spin-offs became more The Phantom Menace than The Empire Strikes Back,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/15/new-star-wars-how-the-tv-spin-offs-became-more-the-phantom-menace-than-the-empire-strikes-back
