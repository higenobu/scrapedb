3/21/2022,"The Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, described the failure of both his cars in the final stages of the Bahrain Grand Prix as his team’s “worst nightmare”. Ferrari claimed a one-two victory with Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz at Formula One’s season-opening race. The reigning world champion, Max Verstappen, who had been on for second place, failed to score, as did his Red Bull teammate Sergio Pérez. Verstappen was left angry with his team, while their retirements allowed Lewis Hamilton to capitalise with an unlikely third place for Mercedes. The extra points he scored, he noted, might be vital in a long, 23-race season. Verstappen had fought with Leclerc throughout the race and been very close on pace with the Ferrari but, having won the title last year, his defence took a setback in the first round and Horner was unequivocal about how hard it had hit the team. “I can’t remember the last time that happened to us but obviously it’s your worst nightmare,” he said. “It’s hugely disappointing, not only to lose a podium with Max, but then also to lose a podium with Checo [Pérez’s nickname] as well. We need to get on top of the issue and come back next weekend.” Verstappen, who was already angry with his team at what he considered was a cautious approach to his tyre use that he believed had cost him chances to attack Leclerc’s lead, issued a damning verdict on what had happened. “You can always say that problems can happen and you might have to retire. But at this level, after already having so much information with engines and stuff, it shouldn’t happen.” Having won last season’s title on the final lap of the final race against Hamilton, taking the championship by just seven points, he was aware of how vital every one might be in what may yet be a three-way fight between Red Bull, Ferrari and Mercedes. “It is just disappointing, you always say to yourself and to the team: ‘We have to score points, it doesn’t matter if it’s first or second in the first race,’” he said. “To lose so many points for the team is also very disappointing, because for the championship where sometimes it can be really tight until the end these are very important points.” For Hamilton and his teammate George Russell, who secured fourth, the points were more than they had expected having been well off the pace of both Ferrari and Red Bull in the race. The seven-time champion acknowledged they may prove vital and that while they had needed some good fortune he also noted they had battled hard to stay in a position to take advantage should anything untoward happen. “Every point can make a difference, I have lost world titles with just one point,” he said. “Whilst we are currently not necessarily performance-wise fighting with these guys, this is not damage limitation but it’s a really, really great result. Of course we are fortunate but ultimately we have done a better job. We have had better reliability. I wouldn’t say that it’s luck, it is everyone’s hard work. “It’s such a long season, it is going to be such a hard battle but we love a challenge. I really do enjoy a challenge. There is no greater feeling when you all come together and get a result like this. We have had better reliability.”",Sport/Sport,Red Bull’s Christian Horner calls loss of both cars their ‘worst nightmare’,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/20/red-bulls-christian-horner-calls-loss-of-both-cars-their-worst-nightmare
3/21/2022,"Sports broadcaster Megan Barnard has responded to “degrading” comments made about her by former colleague Tom Morris, saying she has been overwhelmed by support but that coming out “should never be taken out of someone’s hands”. The Fox Sports presenter’s personal life was thrust into the public sphere last Thursday after the leaking of WhatsApp audio that allegedly contained sexist and homophobic slurs. On Friday Fox Sports sacked Morris over the “unacceptable” remarks, which were widely shared on social media. Morris subsequently apologised on Twitter for his behaviour, which he called “disgusting and disgraceful”. The incident sparked a wave of support for Barnard from the media and public, along with key sporting figures including AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan. “I have been overwhelmed by the amount of support I have received over the past few days in response to the comments about me in the media,” Barnard, who is currently in New Zealand anchoring coverage of the ICC Women’s World Cup, wrote on Instagram. “To everyone who has reached out, thank you. “Fortunately, I am at a place in my life where I am comfortable with who I am and I can handle something deeply personal becoming public. But had this happened as recently as a few years ago, it would not have been the case. “Coming out is a process and should never be taken out of someone’s hands. Nor should anyone be spoken about in such a degrading manner. I hope my experience can be a catalyst for change in not just the sports industry, but in every industry.” Brave and honest by Kelli who has been such an important leader for so many of us.Please send Megan Barnard your messages of support.To our male allies, it would mean a lot if you could commit to stand with us to #callitout if you hear homophobic, racist or gendered slurs. pic.twitter.com/m7V8RscTOU Morris was initially suspended while Fox Sports investigated what it described as an “inappropriate audio recording”. There was reportedly a second audio recording unrelated to Barnard. The network, which holds the rights for matches across a number of codes including the AFL, NRL and cricket, then confirmed his termination based on its “zero tolerance” policy. “Our culture at Fox Sports is based on a respectful, inclusive environment and a fair go for all,” Fox Sports executive director Steve Crawley said. “While Tom’s journalism has made a valuable contribution to Fox Sports over the past seven years, the message we became aware of yesterday crossed the line.” Morris apologised on Friday afternoon via Twitter. “I would like to unconditionally apologise to everyone for my disgusting and disgraceful comments, which became public yesterday,” he wrote. “I am especially sorry to the person involved. No one should ever, in any place, or at any time, be spoken about in that way.” The remarks have prompted commentators to publicly condemn the comments, with some describing it as a line-in-the-sand moment for women and people of diverse backgrounds. Fox Footy and ABC commentator Kelli Underwood said the return to “the dark ages” made her feel “sick in my stomach”, while AFL great Garry Lyon said Fox made the right decision to sack Morris. “We understand and respect the standards and the values of everyone here at the Foxtel group and we – the on-air group – have a responsibility to live those values and not just pay lip service to them,” Lyon said on Fox Footy on Friday night. “We’ve got to be better, we need to be better.” Morris received an apology from Luke Beveridge last week, after the Western Bulldogs coach called him a “gutter journalist” and berated him during a post-game press conference over an accurate report around the team’s selection.",Sport/Sport,Fox Sports presenter Megan Barnard responds to Tom Morris’s ‘degrading’ comments,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/21/fox-sports-presenter-megan-barnard-responds-to-tom-morriss-degrading-comments

3/21/2022,"Bronze medals for Lorraine Ugen and Marc Scott spared Britain’s blushes on the final day of the world indoor championships – but they still endured their worst result in the competition since 2006. On a day when Mondo Duplantis broke his own pole vault world record by flying over 6.20m, and the Venezuelan Yulimar Rojas did the same in the triple jump with an astonishing 15.74m leap, Britain’s celebrations were more muted as they left Belgrade with two medals. Only twice in history – 1987 and 2006 – have Britain come away with fewer medals from a world indoors. But at least Ugen was smiling after her brilliant bronze, which was particularly noteworthy as the 30-year-old is an unsponsored athlete. Ugen, who has set up her own company, Unsigned, and sported the logo on her shoes to earn extra money, jumped 6.82m to finish in third behind the gold medallist, Ivana Vuleta of Serbia, who delighted the home crowd with a leap of 7.06m to beat Nigeria’s Ese Brume into second. “One of the reasons I started Unsigned was to make it less shameful when you don’t have a sponsor,” Ugen said. “I’m world class, I don’t have a sponsor and if anyone is out there, I’m here.” Scott, meanwhile, showed plenty of poise – and when the situation called for it a lot of pace – to win his first global medal in the men’s 3,000m. In a bumpy race, Scott maintained his composure as the Kenyan and Ethiopian athletes duked it out in front of him before kicking hard on the final lap to sneak a bronze in a time of 7min 42.02sec. “The race was choppy and bruising but that’s the way it goes,” Scott said after a race won by Selemon Barega. “I have blood on my shin, but I can’t feel that now. I’m sure I will later when all this sinks in. The pain is worth it to come away with a medal.” Despite a better final day it was a disappointing championship for Britain. Some will blame the absence of some notable stars – Laura Muir has been injured and Dina Asher‑Smith skipped the indoor season – although that is usually the case. Others will point to the bad luck the team had, and there is some truth to that, too. Keely Hodgkinson, a strong favourite for the gold in the women’s 800m, and Elliot Giles, who had his chances in the men’s event, pulled out minutes before they were due to compete. But this performance – coming off the back of a disappointing Olympics, where Britain won only five medals in athletics – will sound further alarm bells about the lack of depth. Elsewhere on the final day the American Grant Holloway won his 57th indoor 60m hurdles race in a row to take gold in 7.39sec, having earlier equalled his own world record. Britain’s David King was sixth in the same race in 7.62, having qualified for the final in unique circumstances. He and the Japanese athlete Shusei Nomoto were tied for the final spot in the final, down to a thousandth of a second: 7.565 to 7.565. It meant that both names were put into a bag – with King’s name being drawn out. “It’s been a crazy day and a rollercoaster of emotions but I’m super happy to come out with luck on my side,” King said. “I would have taken sixth in the world and a PB in the semis every day of the week.” But there was no joy for Britain’s men’s 4x400m relay as they finished fifth in a race won by Belgium and the women’s team were also fifth, with Jamaica the victors, in their final. In the women’s 800m, the American Ajee Wilson took full advantage of Hodgkinson’s absence to take a deserved gold. But there was a shock in the men’s 1500m as the Olympic champion, Jakob Ingebrigtsen, was downed by the Ethiopian Samuel Tefera. In the men’s pole vault, Duplantis broke his own world record for the second time in a fortnight with a leap that suggested that even more is to come in the summer. But the performance of the day surely came from Rojas. So impressive was her leap of 15.74m that it not only broke the world record but it was a full metre clear of the silver medallist, Maryna Bekh‑Romanchuk of Ukraine.",Sport/Sport,Bronze brilliance by Lorraine Ugen and Marc Scott only success for GB,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/20/bronze-brilliance-by-lorraine-ugen-and-marc-scott-only-success-for-gb
3/21/2022,"Rewind more than four decades and, long before Pep Guardiola and Jürgen Klopp became English football’s defining managerial duel, it was Brian Clough against Bob Paisley. If the German, with his Clough-esque charisma, eminent quotability and seeming ability to shape events by force of personality, seems to borrow more from the architect of Nottingham Forest’s success than his most decorated predecessor at Anfield, he has something in common with both. He has coached teams to glory in the European Cup but never the FA Cup. For a couple more months, anyway. Guardiola still blocks his path. Thomas Tuchel, another Champions League winner, may too, but Klopp is into the uncharted territory of a first semi-final. It has been a long and winding road, spanning 20 games over six years featuring 81 players. It took 78 minutes to break down Nottingham Forest. Diogo Jota, who sent Liverpool to Wembley in the Carabao Cup, did likewise in the senior knockout competition. So an FA Cup run that began with outings for Melkamu Frauendorf and Max Woltman against Shrewsbury now features a date with Kevin De Bruyne and Phil Foden. For Klopp, it has been a six-year odyssey that started with Tiago Ilori, Cameron Brannagan, João Teixeira and Jerome Sinclair playing in a 2016 draw with Exeter. It was not his last eclectic selection in this competition. Naming all those 81 players is no mean feat. Yet if a lack of strength in depth accounted for some of Liverpool’s early exits in Klopp’s reign, now he has his deepest ever squad. He is better equipped to rotate and advance. With Forest frustrating him, an advocate of five substitutions in Premier League matches made a quadruple change, summoning the high-calibre quartet of Jordan Henderson, Thiago Alcântara, Takumi Minamino and Luis Díaz. If the goal did not directly stem from any, the ability to throw all on felt significant. Rewind a month and other former European champions, Internazionale, were holding Liverpool until Klopp turned to an enviable bench. They duly lost, too. This was more of a mix‑and‑match team. Perhaps only Virgil van Dijk, Fabinho and Alisson figure in his strongest side, though Jota’s winner enhanced his case to belong in that bracket. For a long time, Roberto Firmino’s place among the automatic choices went unquestioned. The Brazilian may be the definitive Klopp player, the first great gegenpresser and the fulcrum of the inverted forward line, where wingers ran beyond him and outscored him. Anfield’s favourite false 9 finds himself in a curious position now, and not merely with his habit of dropping deep to scurry after the ball. Díaz’s arrival gives Klopp five frontline forwards. Perhaps Firmino is now fifth in line. Maybe his Stakhanovite efforts have drained him of his dynamism and threatened him with decline. A non-scoring striker was reinvented as an impact substitute who delivered telling goals in cameos away at Internazionale and Arsenal. Starting for the first time in five weeks, he overcomplicated matters when trying to chip Ethan Horvath. With Sadio Mané now a rival for his role in the middle of the attack, it may have been an ill-timed miss; if not one that cost Liverpool. Klopp had rested Mané, sparing him for Senegal’s World Cup play-off against Egypt. With Mohamed Salah missing a Liverpool game due to injury for the first time since 2019, he could still hold Díaz in reserve. At the other end, Klopp’s greater interest in the FA Cup was summed up by his choice of goalkeeper. It was not a reserve, but the regular. And as an old rivalry was renewed, this time the man in the green jumper was Alisson, not Clough. There was a throwback to the 1970s, though, as Forest showed their days of resisting Liverpool were not confined to the past. They were fearless. The urgency of their pressing game suggested imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Liverpool meet with more deferential opposition in the Champions League, let alone the Premier League. When a centre-back wearing the captain’s armband made a superb last-ditch challenge, it was Joe Worrall, not Van Dijk. Many suffer in comparison with the Dutchman but the Forest skipper did not. Sean Dyche, a fine judge of a central defender, is a long-time fan of Worrall and his band of admirers may be swelling. He was terrific. Thanks to him, Forest almost became just the fifth team to keep a clean sheet against Liverpool this season. Few have harnessed the power of belief better than Klopp but Forest believed. Djed Spence, the scourge of Arsenal and Leicester, sought to reprise that role. Keinan Davis was a formidable presence in attack. Brennan Johnson buzzed around in the manner of a Klopp forward. Forest could rue the moment Philip Zinckernagel shot wide from Johnson’s inviting cross as Jota popped up a couple of minutes later. It meant Forest’s first quarter-final for 26 years ended in defeat. The Jürgen they encountered in their previous one was Klinsmann, a scorer twice for Bayern Munich in the last eight of the Uefa Cup. Now it was Klopp who advanced. He may yet succeed where Clough famously failed in the FA Cup.",Sport/Football,Crackling renewal of rivalry leaves Klopp hoping to eclipse Clough | Richard Jolly,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/20/crackling-renewal-of-rivalry-leaves-klopp-hoping-to-eclipse-clough
