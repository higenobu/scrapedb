3/2/2022,"More New Yorkers are buying off-market homes, known as ""whisper"" listings. It's a way for them to circumvent a tight, increasingly expensive real estate market. While it's boosting NYC's economy, it's also undermining fair housing laws. In New York, people with the right money and the right connections are purchasing real estate before it goes on the market. While so-called ""whisper,"" ""pocket,"" or ""off-market"" sales aren't new, they provide a major advantage at a time of limited housing availability and outsized demand — and many realtors say they are unethical. They're also surging in one of the most expensive cities in the world. According to Redfin, the amount of off-market transactions in the US has increased 67% since 2019. In New York City alone, 20.6% of homes that were sold in the third quarter of 2021 were pocket listings. The Wall Street Journal reported that 2021 saw a total of $188 million in off-market sales in the city. Pocket listings happen when agents tell potential buyers of a property that isn't yet listed on a multiple listing services (MLS), the databases of properties for sale shared between agents and brokers. This gives the buyer a chance to make an offer without competition. ""Whisper listings have always been very desirable,"" Cathy Franklin, a New York City-based Corcoran agent, told Mansion Global, a luxury real estate listings site. ""It allows a purchaser to have a first look before there's a larger audience."" In California, pocket listings are in a legal grey area. And in a 2019 fair-housing initiative, the National Association of Realtors introduced a policy that attempted to restrict these types of transactions. Despite NARs efforts, the practice remains popular in New York among real estate agents who aren't NAR members. Those agents can still do them, but they can also be sued for not following proper procedure. ""[Although] pocket listings remain a common practice; they can exacerbate segregation and wealth inequality because only certain people are seeing certain listings,"" said mortgage adviser Arnell Brady wrote in a Redfin report. As New York rebounds from the COVID-19 pandemic, housing is shining a bright spot on the economy. However, lackluster inventory has increased prices and intensified homebuyer competition. To circumvent a tightening market, many wealthy buyers in the Big Apple are no longer relying on MLS for leads but instead participating in off-market transactions. They are driving real estate growth, but also undermining fair housing laws and escalating a worsening inventory crisis. ""Actively discouraging submission of listings in the is inconsistent with the fundamental cooperative nature of the MLS and the obligation of the Code of Ethics,"" a NAR spokesperson told Insider, adding that the policy ""was created in order to protect the best interest of consumers and promote equal opportunity for all by ensuring that publicly marketed property listings are widely available and accessible to all consumers."" After plunging during the pandemic, New York City's real estate market began to make a  comeback in winter 2021 as residents came trickling back during the winter to take advantage of discounted apartments. But the market really started to soar come spring when the city reopened. Properties in Brooklyn began to bounce back first, followed by a rebound in Manhattan. ""Since April, I don't think we've ever done this many transactions in such a tight period of time,"" Jeff Adler, a broker with Douglas Elliman, told The Financial Times in September. The year ended on a record-breaking note, with more people than ever snapping up a home in Manhattan. Apartment sales hit a 30-year high in the fourth quarter of 2021 with 3,559 closed purchases of co-ops and condos, according to a report by Miller Samuel Inc. and Douglas Elliman Real Estate. The median price of the apartments sold in the fourth quarter also soared to the highest they've been since 2018, at $1.17 million, with 9.2% of sales above asking price. The snapback is a sign of market correction after the slump, Jay Parsons, vice president and deputy chief economist at real estate software company RealPage, previously told Insider. ""You had a lot of pent-up demand from people who either temporarily left or were planning to move to the city at some point and put those plans on hold,"" he said. While a hot luxury market is driving much needed revenue for the city's economy, it's creating stress for the many hopeful buyers who find themselves in cutthroat competition. That's why many are keeping their ears to the ground for off-market listings, which offer them a leg up over their peers.

3/2/2022,"Nearly three years after a Sawtooths landowner sued to stop construction of a U.S. Forest Service trail across an easement on his property, a judge has ruled that the trail can move forward. In April 2019, Clearwater Analytics co-founder Dave Boren filed a lawsuit against the Sawtooth National Forest, Sawtooth National Recreation Area and several other government agencies and employees over a trail connecting the town of Stanley with nearby Redfish Lake. Boren, whose Sawtooth Mountain Ranch property hosts part of the trail, said the Forest Service did not have the right to construct the trail and argued that the pathway would harm the environment and his enjoyment of his property. Last week, Idaho U.S. Magistrate Judge Candy Dale ruled against Boren on all nine of the lawsuit’s claims. “(Boren’s) overarching theme is that the Forest Service ignored or overlooked environmental conditions when it applied the environmental statutes at issue here,” Dale wrote in a conclusion addressing seven of the claims. “But when the court reviewed the record, the court was confronted with a multitude of environmental analyses, which considered soils, terrestrial wildlife, aquatic species, wetlands, and the values which make the Sawtooth National Recreation Area awe inspiring to all who visit.” Boren also claimed the Forest Service’s easement didn’t give it the right to do construction. Dale said the right for public use always existed for the easement.” The trail, a 4.5-mile gravel path that will allow hikers, bikers and horseback riders to travel between Stanley and Redfish Lake, has been in the works since the early 2000s. In 2005, the Forest Service secured an easement agreement with the former owners of the Sawtooth Mountain Ranch property to construct about 1.5 miles of the trail there. When Boren bought the property in 2016, he was notified of the Forest Service’s plans, according to the lawsuit. Construction on the Stanley-Redfish Trail began in June 2019, shortly after the lawsuit was filed. In 2020, the Forest Service requested a restraining order against Boren and his brother, Michael Boren, after the pair reportedly used Michael Boren’s helicopter to hover over a construction crew working on the trail. The Forest Service also said that Dave Boren’s legal team sent a letter to the construction company, claiming the company “may suffer significant financial loss” if it continued working on the trail. Dave Boren became a vocal critic of the 30-foot-wide trail, launching a campaign to reroute it. The former website for his effort, buildabettertrail.com, is now defunct. Stanley Mayor Steve Botti told the Idaho Statesman he’s “very pleased” with the judge’s ruling. “We think that (ruling) will hopefully clear the way for the completion of that trail, which the city of Stanley has always supported,” Botti said. Botti said the goal is to complete the trail by summer, though construction has paused due to a conflict between the construction contractor and a subcontractor, he said. The majority of the trail is already complete. The Sawtooth National Recreation Area and Boren didn’t immediately respond to the Statesman’s requests for comment Tuesday.",U.S./Idaho Statesman,Sawtooth landowner sued to stop a trail built on his property.

3/2/2022,"Hill said Trump missed a warning that the nuclear option could be on the table in a conflict. Hill told Politico that Putin made the warning in one of his final meetings with Trump. ""I don't think Trump figured out what he was saying,"" Hill, an expert on Russia, said. A former US official said Russian President Vladimir Putin once warned then-President Donald Trump that if it came down to it, he would use the nuclear option but that Trump missed the warning. Fiona Hill, the former senior director for Europe and Russia at the United States National Security Council, told Politico's Maura Reynolds that the road ahead in Russia's invasion of Ukraine is dangerous. On Sunday, Putin ordered Russia's nuclear-deterrent forces to be put on high alert, meaning the weapons have been ordered to prepare for an increased possibility of launch, Insider's Connor Perrett reported. Hill told Politico that the decision was Putin ""making it very clear that nuclear is on the table."" Additionally, Hill said in one of the final meetings between Trump and Putin — where she was present — Putin tried to warn Trump about this very possibility but she didn't ""think Trump figured out what he was saying."" She said: ""Putin was making the point that: 'Well you know, Donald, we have these hypersonic missiles.' And Trump was saying, 'Well, we will get them too.' Putin was saying, 'Well, yes, you will get them eventually, but we've got them first.'"" Hill said there was ""a menace in this exchange"" and Putin was ""putting us on notice that if push came to shove in some confrontational environment that the nuclear option would be on the table."" She told Politico that for Putin, having an ""instrument"" means wanting to use it. ""Why have it if you can't? He's already used a nuclear weapon in some respects,"" Hill said, referencing Russian operatives' use of radioactive polonium against the former spy and dissident Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 and the weapons-grade nerve agent, Novichok, against the agent Sergei Skripal and the opposition leader Alexei Navalny. ""So if anybody thinks that Putin wouldn't use something that he's got that is unusual and cruel, think again. Every time you think, 'No, he wouldn't, would he?' Well, yes, he would. And he wants us to know that, of course,"" Hill said.

 Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said on Tuesday his country won't impose economic sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. ""We are not going to take any sort of economic reprisal because we want to have good relations with all the governments in the world,"" López Obrador said at his daily news conference. López Obrador was internally criticized for his reluctance to condemn the unprovoked invasion, with initial official Mexican reactions calling for dialogue between the parties. A day after hostilities broke out, Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard issued a statement condemning the Russian attack. Mexico was among the 11 United Nations Security Council members to vote for a resolution condemning Russia's actions late last week. Russia vetoed that resolution, and China, India and the United Arab Emirates abstained. Still, López Obrador on Tuesday seemed to sympathize with Russia's position, declining the possibility of imposing sanctions and segueing into what he called ""censorship"" of Russian state media. López Obrador laid out his stance on sanctions in response to a question on Russian company Lukoil's local investments and Aeroflot's operations in Mexico. His refusal to impose sanctions is rhetorical, as he lacks the power to impose sanctions akin to those imposed by Washington and some European capitals. Mexico's sanctions regime is limited to restrictions on individuals and entities from accessing the local financial system in cases of money laundering and terrorist financing, and not geared toward broad financial restrictions with geopolitical reach.",World/The Hill,"Mexico won't impose sanctions on Russia, López Obrador says",https://news.yahoo.com/mexico-wont-impose-sanctions-russia-195638627.html
3/2/2022,"The House of Representatives on Monday night passed The Emmett Till Antilynching Act, which would make lynching a federal hate crime. The bill received unanimous support save for three Republicans. Reps. Andrew Clyde (R-Ga.), Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), and Chip Roy (R-Texas) opposed the bill. In explaining his “no” vote, Massie wrote in a Twitter thread that designating enhanced penalties “for ‘hate’ tends to endanger other liberties such as freedom of speech.” He also argued that lynching is illegal in all states already. More from Rolling Stone Thomas Massie Is Either the Dumbest Member of Congress or He's Joking About Elderly People Dying House Republican Enjoys Lazy Sunday Tweeting Neo-Nazi Meme Lauren Boebert Isn't Letting Murdered Teenagers Get in the Way of Trolling Liberals Over Gun Control Roy issued a statement Tuesday explaining his decision. “Lynching is an unspeakably heinous crime,” he said. “But this bill doesn’t have anything to do with lynching, other than its name.” He called the bill “an effort to advance a woke agenda under the guise of correcting racial injustice” and said it is a “matter for the states.” A representative for Clyde did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Rolling Stone. In a statement following the bill’s passage, Rep. Bobby L. Rush, who introduced the bill, recalled the killing of Emmett Till. Till, a 14 year-old child, was killed in 1955 by a group that accused him of flirting with a white woman. “I was eight years old when my mother put the photograph of Emmett Till’s brutalized body that ran in Jet magazine on our living room coffee table, pointed to it, and said, ‘This is why I brought my boys out of Albany, Georgia,’” Rush said. “That photograph shaped my consciousness as a black man in America, changed the course of my life, and changed our nation.” Rush on Twitter called out the three Republicans who voted against the legislation, noting that Roy once described lynching as “an example of justice.” Who were the 3 votes against the #AntilynchingAct tonight?👇🏾 Andrew Clyde, GA: Called the 1/6 insurrection a “normal tourist visit” Thomas Massie, KY: Wrote a bill to allow guns in school zones Chip Roy, TX: Called lynching an “example of justice” All Republicans. Surprised? — Bobby L. Rush (@RepBobbyRush) March 1, 2022 Roy’s remarks came last year during a hearing about Asian-American hate crimes. “We believe in justice. There’s old sayings in Texas about ‘find all the rope in Texas and get a tall oak tree,’” he said. “You know, we take justice very seriously, and we ought to do that. Round up the bad guys. That’s what we believe.” Many Democrats condemned his comments, with Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa calling his words “a white supremacist dog whistle you can spot from a mile away.” Asked to clarify his statement, Roy doubled down. “Apparently some folks are freaking out that I used an old expression about finding all the rope in Texas and a tall oak tree about carrying out justice against bad guys. I meant it. We need more justice and less thought policing,” he said, adding, “No apologies.” The House voted to pass a version of Till Antilynching Act in 2020 (with four House Republicans, including Massie, voting against it). It then went to the Senate where it was held up by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.). Paul argued that making lynching a hate crime might lead to people being sentenced too harshly. “This bill would cheapen the meaning of lynching by defining it so broadly as to include a minor bruise or abrasion,” he said in a speech on the Senate floor. “Our national history of racial terrorism demands more seriousness of us than that.” Lynching was used in the 19th and 20th centuries as a “popular way of resolving some of the anger that whites had in relation to free blacks,” according to the NAACP. Records kept by the organization counted 4,743 lynchings in the U.S. between 1882 and 1968, although historians believe the actual number of lynchings has been underreported. Most victims, approximately 72 percent, were black, but immigrants and other people of color were also victims of lynching. Numerous anti-lynching bills have been introduced to Congress since a 1918 anti-lynching bill, the Dyer Bill, was introduced to Congress but blocked by a Senate filibuster.
