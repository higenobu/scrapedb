3/15/2022,"(Adds details of diplomatic cable) By Andrea Shalal WASHINGTON, March 14 (Reuters) - The United States told allies in NATO and several Asian countries on Monday that China had signaled willingness to provide military and economic aid to Russia, at Moscow's request, to support its war in Ukraine, a U.S. official said as top U.S. and Chinese officials met in Rome. The message, sent in a diplomatic cable and delivered in person by intelligence officials, also said China was expected to deny those plans, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan was meeting with China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi in Rome, following his warning that China faced consequences if it helped Russia evade Western sanctions and amid reports Russia had asked China for military equipment. Russia denied the reports, saying it has sufficient military resources to fulfill all of its aims in Ukraine. China's foreign ministry spokesperson described the reports as ""disinformation."" Russia began its invasion of neighbor Ukraine on Feb. 24, calling it a ""special operation"" to demilitarize and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Ukraine and Western allies call this a baseless pretext for a war of aggression. Disclosure of both Russia's request and China's response is part of a deliberate strategy by U.S. officials to counter disinformation by being far more open about intelligence matters than usual, the U.S. official said. The diplomatic cable, or demarche, was relatively vague about China's willingness to provide arms to Russia, but intelligence officials were expected to share more details during in-person briefings, said the official. Sullivan on Sunday said Washington was watching closely to see how far China provided economic or material support to Russia. ""We are communicating directly, privately to Beijing, that there will absolutely be consequences for large-scale sanctions evasion efforts or support to Russia to backfill them,"" Sullivan said. ""We will not allow that to go forward and allow there to be a lifeline to Russia from these economic sanctions from any country, anywhere in the world.""

3/15/2022,"Sen. Mitt Romney said former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard's ""treasonous lies may well cost lives."" His remarks followed comments from Gabbard about US-funded biolabs in Ukraine. Russia last week baselessly accused the US of funding the development of bioweapons in Ukraine. Republican Sen. Mitt Romney strongly condemned former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, seemingly responding to comments she has made in recent days about US biological laboratories in Ukraine. ""Tulsi Gabbard is parroting false Russian propaganda. Her treasonous lies may well cost lives,"" Romney said in a tweet on Sunday afternoon. A representative for Romney did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment on what specifically he was referring to. Earlier in the day, Gabbard, who ran for president in 2020, posted a video on Twitter repeating claims about US-funded biolabs in Ukraine. She also appeared on Fox News host Tucker Carlson's show last week and said she was ""deeply concerned"" about claims of bioweapons in Ukraine. Russia has spread a baseless claim that the US is funding the development of bioweapons in labs in Ukraine. Russian and Chinese state media amplified the claims, while the US warned they could indicate that Russia is planning to use chemical weapons in its invasion of Ukraine. In a fact check of Russia's biolabs claims, The New York Times reported that there are biological labs in Ukraine that are backed by the US in an effort to prevent bioweapons from being made or used. The Washington Post reported the labs study African swine fever, which infects pigs rather than humans, with the goal of preventing it from spreading. The Post also reported funding for the Ukraine labs was initially authorized by the Pentagon's Defense Threat Reduction Agency. Representatives for Gabbard did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. Meanwhile, Russian TV played clips of Carlson and Gabbard, The Daily Beast's Julia Davis reported. Mother Jones reported the Kremlin sent a memo instructing state media to feature Carlson ""as much as possible"" because he ""sharply criticizes"" the US and NATO. Rep. Adam Kinzinger also lashed out at Gabbard in a tweet in response to her comments: ""Actual Russian propaganda. Traitorous. Russia also said the Luger center in Georgia was making zombies. Tulsi should go to Russia."" Representatives for Romney and Kinzinger did not respond to requests for comment. Read the original article on Business Insider",Politics/INSIDER,Sen.

3/15/2022,"Russian President Vladimir Putin is feeling ""cornered like a rat"" as his Ukrainian invasion lingers into its third week, a former U.S. intelligence officer told Fox News Digital, and his personal history suggests he will continue to lash out in order to regain the upper hand. Rebekah Koffler, a former U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency agent and author of ""Putin's Playbook: Russia's Secret Plan to Defeat America"", told Fox News Digital on Saturday that an excerpt from Putin’s 2000 autobiography ""First Person"" detailing growing up in a dilapidated Leningrad apartment can be applied to his record as the Russian leader and his current invasion of Ukraine. NO-FLY ZONE IN UKRAINE WORTH THE RISKS; PUTIN MAY ATTACK WESTERN NATIONS ANYWAY, GOP REP SAYS Putin describes in his book having to traverse several rat infested floors to get to his childhood apartment and that one day he wrote that he grabbed a stick and chased a large rat into a corner. When the rat realized he was trapped, he attacked young Putin forcing him to run away in a moment that apparently impacted the future Russian president. Koffler said that the childhood story about the rat, and other stories Putin has approved to be told about his personal life, are a conscious effort to convey to the West that he will always strike back when trapped. ""He wants people to know that when cornered, he will be fighting,"" Koffler told Fox News. ""He will not be surrendering."" ZELENSKYY ISSUES DEFIANT MESSAGE TO RUSSIA: 'LET THEM COME' In another biography, ""Vladimir Putin: Life History"", Putin is quoted as saying that he learned through neighborhood fights as a child that ""you have to fight to the finish line in every fight"" and ""you need to assume that there is no retreat."" Putin’s predicament began when, according to Koffler, he ""miscalculated"" two major issues related to invading Ukraine by not factoring in the Ukrainian people’s will to fight and the role technology would play in bringing the images of destruction to households across the world. ""He definitely miscalculated and now he feels that he’s trapped because he has to execute this operation and reach his goal."" Koffler explained that Putin watched in horror as the U.S. toppled regimes in Libya and Iraq and fears he might meet the same fate, especially when he hears American leaders claim that he is a deranged madman and call for him to be assassinated by his inner circle. Part of the reason Putin is feeling the pressure regardless of any short term victories he may see on the battlefield is that the Russian leader views this fight with Ukraine as a fight for the survival of his country. Author Zbigniew Brzezinski writes in his book ""The Grand Chessboard"" that ""he who controls Eurasia controls the world"" and Koffler says that Putin very much believes in that notion while also believing that the United States feels the same way. ""They know it's not about who controls Ukraine at all,"" Koffler said. ""It’s about who controls Eurasia and who controls the world. This is why you see Putin fighting for his life, for survivability."" Another factor to consider when discussing the pressure Putin feels, Koffler says, is the current proximity of NATO forces to Russia’s large cities. Koffler explained that during the Cold War, the distance between St. Petersburg and NATO forces was roughly 1,000 miles. Today, that distance is roughly 100 miles. ""By Russian military calculations, they just can't afford this sort of thing because it's a military threat,"" Koffler said. All of those issues, Koffler says, suggest Putin feels trapped and will lash out in any way he can in order to get out of the proverbial corner which includes cyberattacks, satellite disruption, bombing civilian areas, and using his nuclear capabilities if ""push comes to shove."" ""He will run his troops into the ground,"" Koffler said, adding that he will ""level Kyiv"" if he feels that is ""what he needs to do.""",World/Fox News,Russia expert: Putin 'cornered like a rat' and will do whatever necessary to lash out,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-expert-putin-apos-cornered-001645710.html
3/15/2022,"WASHINGTON, March 13 (Reuters) - Russia is showing signs of a willingness to engage in substantive negotiations over Ukraine, even as Moscow currently is intent on ""destroying"" its neighbor, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said on Sunday, Sherman, in an interview with ""Fox News Sunday"", said the United States is putting ""enormous pressure"" on Russian President Vladimir Putin to agree to a cease-fire in its weeks-old invasion of Ukraine and to allow the creation of humanitarian corridors to allow civilians to escape. ""That pressure is beginning to have some effect. We are seeing some signs to have real, serious negotiations. But I have to say ... so far it appears Vladimir Putin is intent on destroying Ukraine,"" Sherman said. Following a Russian attack on a military base near Poland's border where NATO defenses are deployed, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said he did not believe a NATO-imposed no-fly zone over Ukraine would have prevented that. And he said that while a no-fly zone has a ""nice air policing sound,"" such a move by NATO would hurl the United States into war with Russia. ""There is very little that you can see that would make sense for this war to be escalated between two nuclear powers,"" Kirby told ABC's ""This Week."" (Reporting by Richard Cowan and Sarah N.
