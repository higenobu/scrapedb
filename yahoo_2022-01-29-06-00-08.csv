1/29/2022,"Walker said he wasn't ""privileged"" to the facts about the bipartisan infrastructure law that passed last year. ""I think you've gotta be an Alabama fan,"" the Georgia Senate candidate and ex-football star snapped during an interview when asked about the law. Sen. Raphael Warnock, who Walker may face this November, enthusiastically supported Biden's plan. Herschel Walker, who is viewed as a top-tier GOP US Senate candidate, snapped on Thursday when he was asked whether he would have voted for President Joe Biden's bipartisan infrastructure law. ""I have to see all the facts,"" Walker told The Daily Caller's Jack Greenberg during an interview when asked if he would have voted for the law. ""Until I see all the facts, you can't answer the question. I think that's what is totally unfair to someone like myself to say, 'What are you going to vote for'?"" Walker added that he ""hadn't been privileged"" to have received all the facts in order to give his opinion on the law. It's not clear what he meant, given that the legislation's contents are public. Walker, who's running in the primary for Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock's seat, also suggested the reporter was an Alabama football fan, a reference to Walker's career in Georgia football, which has a fierce rivalry with the Alabama Crimson Tide. Biden signed the infrastructure bill into law last November after months of debate and stories about its details. Local news reports say Georgia is expected to receive more than $11 billion from the law. Warnock also helped write an earlier version of one of its provisions, an effort to transition to low or zero-emission school buses. Warnock and fellow Georgia Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff voted in favor of the bill, but not a single Georgia Republican lawmaker supported it. Part of Walker's hesitation could be due to the politics surrounding the law. Nineteen Senate Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, voted in favor of the bill. But as McConnell himself has lamented, the legislation became increasingly politicized before its House passage. Former President Donald Trump, who pushed Walker to run, has condemned the proposal after his administration failed to pass its own infrastructure plan. Trump has gone so far as to push primary challenges for lawmakers who voted for Biden's plan. The Georgia race is widely viewed as one of the key battles that will determine whether Democrats can hang onto their razor-thin Senate majority. In a sign of his campaign's strength, Walker reported raising $5.4 million in the final three months of 2020, a staggering war chest for a first-time candidate. Warnock's campaign, not to be outdone, reported having $23 million on hand and raised $9.8 million in the same period.

1/29/2022,"BAGHDAD (AP) — Six rockets struck Baghdad's international airport facility on Friday, damaging two commercial planes but causing no casualties, Iraq's military said in a statement. The rockets fired in the early morning landed on planes parked in a waiting area of Iraqi Airways, the country's national carrier, the statement said. One rocket punched a gaping hole in the cockpit area of the plane. The attack marks an escalation of a series of rocket and drone strikes that have targeted the U.S. and their allies as well as Iraqi government institutions since the start of the year. Most attacks targeting the airport did not cause heavy damage or affect civilian areas of the airport facility. The recent uptick followed the second anniversary of the U.S. strike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassim Soleimani and Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. The military said launch pads for the missiles had been located in the nearby Abu Ghraib area. The airport contains an Iraqi military base that hosts U.S. and other coalition advisors. The rockets landed between the civilian and military areas of the airport, two security officials said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the press. The airline said in a statement that the attack had damaged one of its out-of-service planes parked near the airport but that operations were running normally and no delays were expected. Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi condemned the attack, calling it an attempt “to undermine Iraq's reputation, that we have endeavoured to restore in the region and internationally.” The attack on the airport aimed to undermine confidence in Iraq's security, as well as impede the work of the airline, according to the Iraqi military and the prime minister. Al-Kadhimi called on Iraqi political parties to unequivocally condemn the attack and support Iraqi security forces in the search for those responsible. Their silence over the frequency of attacks has served as a cover for perpetrators, al-Kadhimi said. He also called on the international community not to place restrictions on travel to Iraq as a result of the attack. The U.N. condemned the rising number of “despicable” attacks in a statement urging political actors to act together and expose the culprits. Pro-Iran Shiite factions in Iraq have vowed revenge for Soleimani’s killing and have conditioned the end of the attacks on the full exit of American troops from the country. The U.S.-led coalition formally ended its combat mission supporting Iraqi forces in the ongoing fight against the Islamic State group last month. Some 2,500 troops will remain as the coalition shifts to an advisory mission to continue supporting Iraqi forces.",World/Associated Press,"Iraqi army: Rockets hit Baghdad airport, damage two planes",https://news.yahoo.com/iraqi-officials-least-3-rockets-084936877.html
