3/24/2022,"Four people are dead after a group of five reportedly jumped in unison from a seventh-floor apartment balcony around 7 a.m. Thursday in the Swiss resort town of Montreux on the banks of Lake Geneva, Switzerland. Vaud police spokesman Alexandre Bisenz said the group seems to “have visibly thrown themselves into the void from an apartment” landing hard on the pavement below, where they were found by passersby. Four people were pronounced dead at the scene. A survivor is said to have potentially catastrophic injuries, and is in grave condition at a local hospital. None of the jumpers were wearing shoes, according to witnesses who saw the bodies. Neighbors on the seventh floor of the residential apartment block told police that a family of five—two adults in their forties, two teenagers, and a grandmother—moved into the flat three years ago. Police did not confirm whether the jumpers were that family. “We heard nothing from their home, the father never said hello in the hallway and ordered many packages almost daily,” Claude Rouiller, who lives nearby, told Le Temps newspaper. He added that a strong smell of incense had been wafting from under the apartment door for the last few days. One neighbor who saw the bodies on the pavement told the paper that many people in the building thought the family belonged to a cult. Many of the residents heard the sound of impact as the bodies hit the ground, reportedly at the same time, which led police to refer to the incident as a “group jump.” Forensic police are combing the apartment for clues about what led to the horrific tragedy, including whether anyone else could have been in the apartment leading up to the incident. Residents shared photos and theories on the apartment WhatsApp group, according to local media. “It was a quarter to seven, I got out of the shower, had a coffee and heard a thud,” a neighbor told the paper. “I thought it was a bad film, I couldn’t look at the image for more than a few seconds.” If you or a loved one are struggling with suicidal thoughts, please reach out to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), or contact the Crisis Text Line by texting TALK to 741741.

3/24/2022,"Former heavyweight Mike Tyson almost put them paws on a man who pulled a gun on him. TMZ reports the champ took a night off to attend a comedy show at a rooftop bar in Hollywood on Tuesday, March 22. In a video, Tyson sits calmly at the table with friends before a man rudely disrupts a comedian’s set. Things go left when the man begins approaching Tyson saying, “I’m trying to upgrade my status. All I need is you. All I need is you.” Eyewitnesses told TMZ the man had challenged Tyson to a fight, but he would not engage. Afterward, patrons in the crowd began instructing the man to leave, which resulted in him pulling a gun from his waist. The video then cuts to the man boldly approaching Tyson’s table again, asking him not to call the police. Instead of giving the man grief for scaring the small crowd, the boxing legend embraced him with a hug. According to TMZ, the man threatened to shoot the show host, but he never fired his weapon. The outlet also shared the video on Instagram, where commentators commended the boxing champ for keeping his composure. One person noticed, “Mike didn’t flinch when he pulled the strap.” Another said, “Shiddddd, Mike ain’t move wasn’t bothered at all lol better leave mike alon[e].” A third said, “Always fear the calmest one in the room.” Dozens questioned why the man would challenge Mike Tyson, of all boxer,s to a fight. Meanwhile, a handful attributed Tyson’s calm demeanor in the video to his hometown in Brooklyn, New York. “He from NY. Come on that’s nothing,” said one person. Another added, “Man at peace with his life and [you] trying to bring the Brooklyn outta him smh. Humans the worse.” Referencing the 1997 fight where Tyson bit off a piece of Evander Holyfield‘s ear, one individual wrote, “He should bite off a nose next.”",U.S./Atlanta Black Star,‘Mike Didn’t Flinch When He Pulled The Strap’: Guy Pulls Gun on Mike Tyson After Challenging Boxing Legend to a Fight,https://news.yahoo.com/mike-didn-t-flinch-pulled-113000689.html
3/24/2022,"A man moved out of his apartment without telling his roommates. Now he’s wondering if it was a poor choice. He took to Reddit’s “Am I the A******? (AITA)” forum for advice. His twin brother and two friends moved in with him temporarily. But when they became nightmare roommates and decided to live there permanently, the Reddit poster came up with an escape plan. Auto insurance rates are increasing in 2022 — here’s how to prepare “I moved out of my parent’s house two years ago into my own apartment,” he explained. “During this time I worked night shifts for an internet service provider as a lineman. I would frequently work from 10 p.m. until 7 a.m. or 12 a.m. until 9 a.m. When it came to renting, my contract was that I would pay rent every two months at the request of the landlord. I would frequently have my girlfriend over as she shared a similar work schedule.” “Everything changed six months ago when my twin brother and two friends who also happened to be twins decided to follow my stead and move out for the next university semester. For two months they had no issues in their own apartment. [Then they] pleaded with me to let them move in for two months so they could find a cheaper apartment as they were worried about inflation.” Buried in debt? A financial expert weighs in on how to get back on track He agreed to let them move in as long as they agreed to cover their share of the rent and groceries, help with chores and cooking and maintain a five-hour quiet period after he got back from work. “The problems began in the second month, it started with the twins quitting their jobs at the request of their mother,” he wrote. “Then their mother began to visit every two to three days and would always come during the quiet period. Aside from the visits, they all began to game with voice chats so that it would frequently wake me up. I tried to remind them of the rules only to be met with excuses.” “Behind my back mine and the twin’s mother decided that the current living situation would be permanent. I was having none of it, I secretly made preparations and plans with my girlfriend so that I could move in with her. When the twin’s mother planned an impromptu trip to their cottage I seized the opportunity and within a day I moved out. I left a note saying that I would no longer be living there and that the current rent has been paid. The next rent period and utilities are theirs to handle.” Redditors thought the poster did what he had to do. “Your brother and his friends sound like HORRIBLE roommates,” someone wrote. “They basically took the apartment from you, ignored the rules, changed their agreement without asking, and now they can pay for it,” another said. “They didn’t consult you about the situation being permanent so you granted them the same courtesy when moving out,” someone added.

3/24/2022,"Tia-Claire Toomey is a five-time CrossFit Games champion and trained for Olympic bobsled. She said her diet was designed to help her lose weight slowly, while maintaining performance. Toomey eats about 2,500 calories a day, including bagels, peanut butter, meat, and fruit. To lose weight, the ""Fittest Woman on Earth"" relies on a heaping breakfast packed with bagels, bacon, and peanut butter, as well as plenty of protein and carbs sprinkled throughout her day, to support an intense workout schedule. Tia-Claire Toomey, a five-time champion of the CrossFit Games, shared a YouTube video on Monday showing what she ate to transition from training for the Olympic bobsled team back to CrossFit. CrossFit incorporates multiple fitness disciplines, from weightlifting to gymnastics, and tests of stamina, like long trail runs and open-water swimming. As a result, it can be advantageous if CrossFit athletes put on muscle mass in the offseason, then try to get leaner for competition. Toomey's fat-loss diet focuses on dropping weight slowly, while making sure she has plenty of energy to complete her training, according to her coach (and husband), Shane Orr. In total, her day of eating clocks in at about 2,500 calories, compared with the 3,000 to 3,500 daily calories she consumed during bobsled season. For breakfast, Toomey has a bagel with bacon, two eggs, another half a bagel topped with peanut butter and banana, blueberries, and supplements. At 790 calories, it's the biggest meal of the day with plenty of fats, protein, and carbs, which Toomey said helped her perform more effectively. ""I find I have enough energy and I recover very well,"" she said. Toomey has said she relies heavily on high-carb foods to fuel workouts. She incorporates about 790 calories' worth of snacks throughout the day to keep her energy up, including oatmeal, bananas, fruit snacks, and protein smoothies. Lunch is 500 calories, high-protein with quick-digesting carbs, which Toomey eats during a long break between training sessions. The meal consists of ground beef, liver, and white rice. It's high in iron, zinc, and vitamin A. Toomey rounds out the day with a light but filling dinner of pork tenderloin, potatoes, avocado, and salad, which is about 440 calories.
