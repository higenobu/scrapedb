1/14/2022,"Manufacturers in Northern Ireland have ranked the post-Brexit arrangements for trade in Northern Ireland as the least of the challenges facing their businesses, according to a quarterly industry survey, with 28% saying trade with the EU has increased over the last year. The top concern was listed as labour shortages caused by the pandemic but also the end of freedom of movement that prevents EU citizens living in border counties in the republic of Ireland crossing into Northern Ireland for work.  “The protocol was the least of their worries,” said Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing Northern Ireland (MNI), which conducted the survey. While we all get caught up in the political narrative, in business the bigger concerns are staff recruitment, productivity and then the pandemic itself. “It shows the narrative favoured by the DUP [Democratic Unionist party] and others that Northern Ireland is going to hell in a handcart because of the protocol is quite clearly not the case, quite the opposite,” Kelly added. He said there was a “huge uptick” in the number of firms accepting that the “protocol is here to stay”, but many want it to work better through simplifications of paperwork. The survey reveals some businesses are now enjoying a Brexit dividend, with 28% saying they have experienced an increase in trade with the EU including the republic of Ireland. Two in five businesses also want the Northern Ireland executive, the equivalent of the government’s cabinet, to seize the unique opportunities the country has to trade with both the UK and the single market. The survey comes as the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, who took over Brexit negotiations after the resignation of Lord Frost before Christmas, holds a second day of talks with the European Commission over the protocol and wider relations with the EU. Truss is hosting the commission’s vice-president, Maroš Šefčovič, at Chevening House in Kent. Sources say that the UK will continue to press for further compromises on the checks on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Businesses surveyed by MNI show that while it may not be a priority concern, many are still experiencing a “negative impact” of the checks and customs controls on goods crossing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. However, the portion expressing concern in the last quarter is just over 50% down from 77% in the first quarter. Great Britain’s readiness for the customs paperwork that applies to goods “remains the big issue” as one in five “report their GB suppliers are unwilling to send” to Northern Ireland. “This has remained consistent throughout 2021,” said Kelly.",News/UK news,Northern Ireland manufacturers say Brexit protocol least of worries – survey,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/14/northern-ireland-manufacturers-say-brexit-protocol-least-of-worries-survey
1/14/2022,"The gate that once proudly displayed the name of Godwins primary school in Kampala has been removed. The compound, where pupils played at break time, is now a parking area for trucks ferrying goods to the nearby market, while the classrooms have been turned into a travellers’ lodge. Uganda’s schools were ordered to reopen on Monday 10 January, after nearly two years of closure – the longest school shutdown in the world – but not all were able to welcome pupils back. Godwins, in Kalerwe in Kawempe division, is one of the many schools that will never reopen. It had been in existence for 20 years catering to children whose parents work in nearby Kalerwe market.  Harriet Namubiru, a charcoal seller whose two grandchildren, aged eight and 10, attended the school, says its closure is a “tragedy that has befallen us”. “The management of the school called a meeting and they told us ‘It has become very hard for us to run again. We shall not open,’” she says. “It was like lightning or something [had hit us]. Some parents who were in the meeting fainted. Some fell sick for weeks.” Kampala’s suburbs are littered with ghost structures that were once schools. Some buildings were sold, while others have been destroyed to make way for real estate development. Kampala Capital City Authority said that more than 40 schools in the city have closed for good. Local media is awash with reports of schools turned into bars, restaurants or travellers’ accommodation. There are no official figures on the number of schools that have failed to reopen countrywide. Kidcare nursery and primary school in the suburb of Najjera is now a depot for beverages. The dusty classrooms and dining hall at nearby Najjera progressive school lie empty; some of Najjera’s classroom blocks have been destroyed to make way for a real estate development. At Makerere highway school in Kivulu, a Kampala slum, pupils were welcomed by heavy padlocks. The building owner says she “no longer wants school business on her property”. She says previous schools have not paid rent for two years and she has opted to use the space for other businesses. Upcountry, some students arrived to find school roofs blown off or classrooms taken over by anthills. They were forced study under trees. Covid guidelines mean extra costs for schools and parents. Schools unable to meet these and the demands by some landlords that they pay rent arrears will stay shut – and many may never reopen. Namubiru is still searching for an affordable school for her grandchildren. “It’s difficult. Our school [Godwins] understood us. It accepted our children, and we brought tuition fees whenever we could,” she says, explaining that new schools are expensive and require fees upfront. The reopening of schools was met with relief by pupils, teachers and parents, but the turnout at many was low. At Chegere primary school in the northern Apac district, just one pupil appeared on the first day. Local media reports zero turnouts at some schools in the central district of Nakasongola. Nicholas Bwire, director of St Nicholas primary school in Mukono, central Uganda, says he registered few pupils but is optimistic that more will attend. “The turnout for learners has been poor. Parents are still worried that they may bring children, pay tuition fees only for schools to be closed again after a few weeks. This happened to them early last year when schools closed just days after opening,” he says. “[Parents] are telling us that ‘we’re coming on Monday’.” Bwire says he is happy that all his teachers except one showed up. All his non-teaching staff resigned, but he hopes to recruit new ones. Christine Babirye, a teacher at a community kindergarten in Kampala, says parents cited fees and lack of materials as reasons for not sending their children in the first week. She says her school has lowered tuition costs and encouraged parents to bring pupils. For those returning after 83 weeks away from the classroom, it is a cheerful moment. “I feel very good to be back at school. [Life at] home was boring,” says Mark Kibuuka, 14, a pupil at Bat valley primary school in Kampala. Fellow pupil Shatrah Nanyange, 11, adds: “My mother told me ‘If you go to school, be a good child and if you study well, I will give you everything you want.’ I am doing just that.” But experts warn the impact of long closure on schools and pupils cannot be overstated. Before the pandemic, Uganda was battling poor educational outcomes. This will worsen as dropouts grow. Dr Ibrahim Kasirye, a researcher at the thinktank Economic Policy Research Centre, says: “Inequalities in access to education have been exacerbated by the nearly two years closure of schools.” “The variation in the ability to access alternative forms of learning offered to kids during the lockdowns such as using radios and televisions, newspapers, and the internet has created two worlds within the country– – one that lost most of the two years of schooling and another, a ‘first world’ that managed the crisis and continued learning,” he says, urging special attention for the group that did not learn at all. Dr Mary Goretti Nakabugo, the executive director of Uwezo, a charity promoting access to learning in Uganda, says the country’s education sector is “in a crisis”. “We must ensure that all learners go back to school, but also what happens when they are back matters to ensure that they are not worried and are able to stay.” Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",News/Global development,Term starts in Uganda – but world’s longest shutdown has left schools in crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/14/term-starts-in-uganda-but-worlds-longest-shutdown-has-left-schools-in-crisis

With his signature mix of rolling piano playing and New Orleans sensibilities, he paved the way for artists from Elvis to the Beatles. Through electrifying vintage footage and interviews with the man himself, along with his collaborators, this documentary explores Domino’s life and legacy beyond his death in 2017. Henry Wong A cracking biography of the woman who, until the censorious 1934 Production Code took away her best lines, was Hollywood’s biggest star.

HR Save the Cinema (Sara Sugarman, 2022), 10.55am, 8pm, Sky Cinema PremiereA true story ripe for dramatic treatment, Sara Sugarman’s guileless drama follows the fight to save the Lyric in Carmarthen in the early 1990s. Hairdresser and youth theatre leader Liz Evans (a warm performance by Samantha Morton) rouses the opposition, including Jonathan Pryce’s retired teacher Mr Morgan, when the council plans to replace the cinema with a shopping centre. There’s light villainy in the shape of venal mayor Tom (Adeel Akhtar), a dash of Hollywood glamour and a gently reiterated message about the importance of community and local heritage. Simon Wardell Planes, Trains and Automobiles (John Hughes, 1987), 9pm, Comedy CentralWho needs a straight man when you have talents such as Steve Martin and John Candy riffing off each other? In John Hughes’s superb comedy, the two are thrown together on a frantic, weather-impeded trip from New York to Chicago as they race to get home in time for Thanksgiving. Martin’s advertising executive Neal (superior, quick to anger) and Candy’s travelling salesman Del (genial, accident-prone) are the perfect odd couple in a film that bears comparisons to Midnight Run for its smartly plotted twists and characterful humour. SW The Tragedy of Macbeth (Joel Coen, 2021), Apple TV+For his first film without collaborator/brother Ethan, Joel Coen has delivered a confident, stylish take on Shakespeare’s murderous Scottish play. Denzel Washington is a magnificently brooding Macbeth, while Frances McDormand embraces the dark side as his lady – a role she was born to play. Their regicidal plot is worked out across austere locations in crisp black-and-white imagery reminiscent of Ingmar Bergman’s The Seventh Seal. In an inventive touch, Kathryn Hunter plays all three “weird sisters” while eloquent support comes from Bertie Carvel as the doomed Banquo and Alex Hassell as an intriguingly shifty Ross.

1/14/2022,"Like news of illegal Downing Street “work events” held during lockdown, the transfer rumours keep coming thick and fast and much like yesterday, Manchester United figure prominently in today’s tell-all and are being linked with all manner of comings and goings. Disaffected midfielder Donny van de Beek is waiting impatiently in the departures lounge, having been offered to Newcastle United and Borussia Dortmund, while Paul Pogba continues to be linked with Paris Saint-Germain, whose manager Mauricio Pochettino could still go the other way. United have identified Napoli’s Spanish midfielder Fabián Ruiz as a potential replacement for Pogba, whose contract expires in June and future remains very much up in the air.  With their star turn Federico Chiesa out for the season after suffering an ACL injury in his side’s win over Roma last weekend, Juventus are eyeing up replacements in the form of United’s Anthony Martial or Arsenal’s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Already in the market for a new striker before Chiesa’s unfortunate collision with Chris Smalling, Juve have been forced to into an urgent rethink as far as their January transfer plans are concerned. Having successfully signed Chris Wood from Burnley, Newcastle remain interested in bringing Todd Cantwell to St James’ Park from Norwich City in a move that probably wouldn’t be viewed as weakening another relegation rival considering how little time the playmaker has spent on the pitch this season. Cantwell, who has also been linked with Leeds United, is expected to be in Norwich’s squad for Saturday’s game against Everton after recovering from illness. With their January trolley-dash ongoing, Newcastle have also bid for Sevilla central defender Diego Carlos and have been warned they will have to pay the thick end of £40m to prise Serbian defender Nikola Milenković away from Fiorentina. Currently “winning” the January window after signing Philippe Coutinho and Lucas Digne, Aston Villa hope to consolidate by luring Yves Bissouma away from Brighton. Valued at £50m and also on the radar of Manchester United and Liverpool, the Mali midfielder is currently away in Cameroon and has 18 months left on his contract with Brighton. However, his employers have hinted they might be tempted to cash in if they get a decent offer. “There are lots of ifs and buts,” said Graham Potter upon being asked about Bissouma’s future. “I’m confident. Yves is enjoying his football here but as I have said with the transfer window you never know.” Following their impressive performance against Liverpool, Arsenal are giving the glad eye to Youri Tielemans and Gini Wijnaldum. In the final 18 months of his contract, Tielemans is unlikely to leave Leicester this month but Brendan Rodgers has revealed a summer exit could be on the cards. “For players it’s about ambition, the challenge and sometimes it’s about a different environment,” he said. “We have seen it before many times.” In more heartwarming news for Leicester fans, their club is hell bent on making Ademola Lookman’s loan move from Leipzig permanent.",Sport/Football,Football transfer rumours: Aubameyang to Juventus?

1/14/2022," Four parents meet in a church to talk about an incident several years earlier when the teenage son of one couple murdered the other pair’s son in a school shooting. Fran Kranz’s intense film is an ostensibly simple drama, theatrical in its single-setting, real-time setup, but shot in intimate closeup and red raw emotionally. Martha Plimpton and Jason Isaacs, as the victim’s mum and dad, and Ann Dowd and Reed Birney, playing the killer’s parents, give devastating performances. Running the gamut of grief, they ask hard questions – how much do you really know your children? Are you to blame for their actions? Is forgiveness possible after such trauma? – and find no easy answers.Wednesday 19 January, 3.20am Sky Cinema Premiere In 1630s New England, a none-more-pious father, William (Ralph Ineson), is banished from his Puritan settler community and takes his family to farm on the fringes of a forest. There, his wife Katherine (Kate Dickie) gives birth to a son – but while her eldest child Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy, in her first starring role) is babysitting, the boy is abducted by a witch. Based on true accounts from the time, the debut film from Robert Eggers is a gloriously nightmarish horror, imaginative and brutal, as dark forces – and mutual suspicion – overwhelm the family.Sunday 16 January, 12.55am, Channel 4 In Michael Sarnoski’s deft drama, Nicolas Cage plays Rob, an Oregon forest-dwelling loner whose beloved pig – source of the truffles he sells – is abducted. Distraught, he heads into Portland with his young business contact, Amir (Alex Wolff), to find the lost porker. It’s the perfect recipe for a revenge thriller a la Point Blank – but this is the usually 11-on-the-dial Cage turned down to a two. Rob’s past in a quasi-criminal world of high-end dining, fight clubs and foodie philosophy is revealed slowly, with Cage simmering away nicely.Sunday 16 January, 10.35am, 8pm, Sky Cinema Premiere The most celebrated in a wave of turn-of-the-millennium wuxia movies (a martial arts genre originating in China) that wowed western audiences, Ang Lee’s 2000 film still stands up. From vivid green bamboo forests to the dust-yellow Gobi desert, it’s an adventure of relentless visual splendour, as skilled swordspeople (and unconsummated soulmates) Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh seek a mysterious thief. Could it be the imperial governor’s soon-to-be married daughter (Zhang Ziyi)? Forbidden romance and kung fu action in one stylish package.Monday 17 January, 6.40pm, Great!

The Better Call Saul star adds several new skills to his CV, particularly in a superb close-quarters fight sequence on a city bus.Friday 21 January, 12noon, 8pm, Sky Cinema Premiere This involving Iranian drama deservedly won a major prize at Cannes last year for its director, Asghar Farhadi.

While on temporary release, he’s given a handbag containing gold coins found by his secret girlfriend.

The author’s interest in the second world war and the spy game is served well by Christian Schwochow’s film of his novel, as George MacKay’s fictional civil servant Hugh Legat crosses paths with real figures, principally Neville Chamberlain. Revolving round the prime minister’s dealings with Hitler on the eve of the conflict, it’s a stirring tale of derring-do and political manoeuvring, with Legat and his old friend, German foreign office official Von Hartmann (Jannis Niewöhner), trying to expose Hitler’s belligerent ambitions.Friday 21 January, Netflix",Arts/Television & radio,Mass to A Hero: the seven best films to watch on TV this week,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/14/mass-to-a-hero-the-seven-best-films-to-watch-on-tv-this-week
1/14/2022,"Ben McElroy first made music as a teenager experimenting with cassette recorders. His adult process may have upgraded to a laptop, but his primary tools remain doggedly lo-fi: accordions in such a state of distress that they fall apart before the end of a song, disintegrating audio equipment, plus well-worn string instruments, whistles and guitars. All often come together to create a shivering seabed of sound: when his barely there vocals appear, as they do on the title track, it evokes a haunting.  How I Learnt to Disengage from the Pack recalls the ambient/indie-folk of groups such as Epic45, with technology adding texture – although McElroy’s tunes are often cast in more traditional clothes. Store Away for a Winters Day features a fiddle pivoting and swooping over a pretty soft drone, while Hedgehogs begins like a piece of 8-bit rural weirdness (carrying hints of the Ghost Box record label’s output) before blossoming into something straighter, but still playful and free. See More engineers webs of bright guitars before the tune turns into a processed, enveloping shimmer – suggesting a dazzle in communion with the natural world – while Wolves Dance yomps with grit on its boots, leading off from a cello towards whistles that create their twisted Celtic lament, accompanied by scattershot hand drums. Deeper stuff also lurks in its layers. Buried birdsong in From Time to Time casts the bouncy tune after it in a strange sheen, while electronic decay rubs and twitches throughout. A teacher by day, McElroy recorded this album in snatches over five years; finishing it coincided with the end of his relationship, and he wonders whether we can hear that loss in its fissures. If anything, this record is too pretty, and could do with more baring of teeth. Nevertheless, it remains a beautiful early year listen, shining a light in tough times. Niteworks’ A’ Ghrian is the Skye band’s third album of Gaelic and Scots tunes taken down the trance rave-up. When it works it’s perversely fantastic, although it has to stray far from folk – you’d never guess that Gura Mise Tha Fo Èislein (I Am Full of Grief) was based on a traditional tune – but too often past and present jar for the pipers going poppers-o’clock. Nancy Kerr’s meaty and moving The Poor Shall Wear the Crown: Songs by Leon Rosselson (Little Dish) explores the political songbook of the folk club singer, children’s writer and Russian refugee.

1/14/2022,"Ukraine has been hit by a “massive” cyber-attack, with the websites of several government departments including the ministry of foreign affairs and the education ministry knocked out. Officials said it was too early to draw any conclusions but they pointed to a “long record” of Russian cyber assaults against Ukraine, with the attack coming after security talks between Moscow and the US and its allies this week ended in stalemate.  Suspected Russian hackers left a message on the foreign ministry website, according to reports. It said: “Ukrainians! … All information about you has become public. Be afraid and expect worse. It’s your past, present and future.” The message reproduced the Ukrainian flag and map crossed out. It mentioned the Ukrainian insurgent army, or UPA, which fought against the Soviet Union during the second world war. There was also a reference to “historical land”. NEWS IN KYIV: Several Ukrainian government websites down due to a major a cyberattack. Below is the @MFA_Ukraine website now. It reads in part: ""Ukrainians!...All information about you has become public, be afraid and expect worse."" Sites of MOD and Education ministry also down. pic.twitter.com/3lbA06Q3Fl In a message to the Guardian, the foreign ministry’s spokesperson, Oleg Nikolenko, said: “As a result of a massive cyber-attack, the website of the ministry of foreign affairs and other government agencies are temporarily down.” He added: “Our specialists have already started restoring the work of IT systems and the cyber-police has opened an investigation.” Josep Borrell, the EU’s top diplomat, condemned the attacks. He said the EU’s political and security committee and cyber units would meet to decide how to respond and to support Kyiv. “We are going to mobilise all our resources to help Ukraine to tackle this. Sadly, we knew it could happen,” he said. He added: “It’s difficult to say (who is behind it). I can’t blame anybody as I have no proof. But we can imagine.” Sweden’s foreign minister Ann Lind said the West must stand up to any Russian aggression. “We have to be very firm in our messages to Russia: that if there are attacks against Ukraine, we will be very harsh and very strong and robust in our response,” she said. Sweden stood in solidarity with Kyiv, she added. On Thursday, Russian envoys sounded a bleak note after discussions this week with the OSCE in Vienna, as well as Nato and the US. Sergei Ryabkov, who led Russia’s delegation, said talks had hit a dead end. The Kremlin has demanded an assurance Ukraine and Georgia will never join Nato. It wants Nato to remove troops and equipment from its member states in eastern Europe, and to return deployment to 1997-levels, before Nato expanded. Russia has mobilised 100,000 troops on the border with Ukraine and sent in military hardware. On Friday Russia’s defence ministry announced that further equipment would be relocated from the east of the country as part of what it said was an “exercise”. Ukraine has been repeatedly targeted since 2014, when Moscow annexed Crimea and kickstarted a war in the eastern Donbas region. About 288,000 cyber-attacks took place in the first 10 months of 2021, according to official figures, with 397,000 in 2020. The attacks have also been directed at critical infrastructure. In winter 2015 suspected Russian hackers took out parts of the country’s power grid, which led to almost a quarter of a million Ukrainians losing power and heat. A repeat attack happened in 2016. In 2017, suspected Russian hackers unleashed the NotPetya virus, causing mayhem. Banks, newspapers and leading companies were targeted.",News/World news,Ukraine hit by ‘massive’ cyber-attack on government websites,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/14/ukraine-massive-cyber-attack-government-websites-suspected-russian-hackers
1/14/2022,"Virginia Giuffre has praised a court ruling enabling her sexual assault civil lawsuit against the Duke of York to proceed to trial and said she will “continue to expose the truth”. Giuffre wrote on Twitter she was “pleased” with the ruling, adding: “I’m glad I will have the chance to continue to expose the truth & I am deeply grateful to my extraordinary legal team.  “Their determination helps me seek justice from those who hurt me and so many others. My goal has always been to show that the rich and powerful are not above the law & must be held accountable. “I do not walk this path alone, but alongside countless other survivors of sexual abuse & trafficking.” The Manhattan federal judge Lewis Kaplan dismissed a motion by Prince Andrew’s lawyers on Wednesday to have the civil case thrown out after they argued Giuffre had waived her right to pursue the royal by signing a confidential settlement in 2009 with the financier Jeffrey Epstein. Giuffre, 38, claims she was trafficked by Epstein to have sex with powerful people, including Andrew, when she was 17. Andrew has consistently denied her allegations. He now faces the prospect of Giuffre giving a detailed account of the accusations and of having to divulge aspects of his personal life in open court this autumn. Legal experts have said that one way for the duke, 61, to avoid trial would be to reach an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre, but there are increasingly suggestions she would want to have her day in court, and her lawyer, David Boies, has said she would be unlikely to accept a “purely financial settlement”. Boies told Newsnight after the ruling on Wednesday: “I think it’s very important to Virginia Giuffre that this matter be resolved in a way that vindicates her and vindicates the other victims.” He added: “I don’t think that she has a firm view at this point, nor could she, as to exactly what the resolution should be. But I think what’s going to be important is that this resolution vindicates her and vindicates the claim she’s made.” It comes after the Queen stripped the Duke of York of his military affiliations and royal patronages as the dramatic fallout from the case continues. In a devastating blow to Andrew, who was born His Royal Highness, Buckingham Palace also said he would no longer use the HRH royal style in any official capacity. The decision represents the duke’s complete removal from official royal life, and an attempt to distance the monarchy from Andrew, who was once second in line to the throne as the spare to the heir, in the year of the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee. Legal experts say the duke’s options are now stark and limited. He can seek a settlement out of court, though a settlement with no admission of liability could be costly, and, as mentioned, Giuffre may not wish to settle. He can also contest the case, but that means giving a deposition under oath – possibly giving oral evidence – during which he will be questioned on highly personal matters. He can also default, in effect ignoring the court case, but that would lead to a finding against him. Andrew could also file for a motion of reconsideration on Kaplan’s ruling, or he could take an appeal straight to the second circuit court of appeals. Any appeal would delay proceedings.",News/UK news,Virginia Giuffre praises ruling to allow Prince Andrew lawsuit to go to trial,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/14/virginia-giuffre-praises-ruling-to-allow-prince-andrew-lawsuit-to-go-to-trial
