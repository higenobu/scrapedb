12/12/2021,"TV personality and medical professional Dr. Mehmet Oz is calling for Dr. Anthony Fauci to be ""held accountable,"" suggesting that he should resign as Americans have lost ""faith and confidence"" in his service. Oz, who announced last month that he was joining the race for the U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, took aim at Fauci in a statement to the New York Post. DR. OZ'S PAST GUN CONTROL POSITIONS RAISE EYEBROWS, BUT HE SAYS HE STRONGLY SUPPORTS SECOND AMENDMENT ""Dr. Anthony Fauci has lost the faith and confidence of the American people,"" Oz said. ""It’s time for a new face talking to the American people, one that is more trusted."" Oz also stated he believes Fauci ""should be held accountable for misleading, whether willfully or unintentionally, the American public and the United States Congress"" on matters relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, faced immense scrutiny from the American people after he shifted positions and contradicted himself on a number of guidelines, including the usage of face masks and the threat of COVID-19 in America. Earlier this year, Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, proposed the ""FIRED"" (Fauci Incompetence Requires Early Dismissal) Act in light of his mixed messaging. ""Dr. Fauci is at odds with the CDC,"" Davidson said in May. ""He has repeatedly put political science ahead of the science on COVID-19.""

12/12/2021,"The winner of California’s largest jackpot ever has been revealed. On Oct. 4, the California Lottery announced it had a winner for a record-setting, $699 million jackpot — and Scott Godfrey had the golden ticket, the Lottery said Thursday in a news release. Godfrey’s winning ticket matched the six numbers 66-12-22-54-69 and the Powerball number 15, according to the release. “It feels great to win big, of course, but I’m especially happy that this jackpot means $78 million was raised for California public education,” Godfrey said in the news release. “Even the times I’ve played in the past and didn’t win, I always felt, well, at least a few bucks of this will be going to help schools.” The California Lottery held the first draw on June 9 but failed to match a ticket to the winning number for four months until Godfrey walked into the Morro Bay Albertsons at 730 Quintana Road. Interestingly, the winning combination was the first set of numbers on his ticket of 10 quick picks. This drawing was the fifth-largest jackpot in Powerball history and seventh-largest jackpot in U.S. lottery history. Godfrey opted to take the lump sum of cash, which adds up to about $496 million after taxes, according to the release. Godfrey’s giving nature was even more clear after he spoke with KSBY on Thursday. The lucky winner stopped by the KSBY studios yesterday to drop-off a car full of toys for the station’s Season of Hope toy drive and told anchor Nina Lozano that his family had set up a foundation to distribute the money to various charitable organizations. “We are private people, and we intend to stay that way,” Godfrey said in the release. “We’ve also, for a long time, been involved in charitable activities, and now we can really scale those efforts to take full appreciation of this blessing. This money is not about me. It’s about all of the good that can come from it.”",U.S./San Luis Obispo Tribune,Lottery identifies Morro Bay Powerball winner.
