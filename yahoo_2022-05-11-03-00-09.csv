5/11/2022,"Saudi Oil Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman warned Tuesday that the world is ""running out of energy capacity at all levels."" ""I am a dinosaur, but I have never seen these things,"" he said at a conference. A UAE official also warned that more investment is needed in the energy sector for OPEC+ to deliver sufficient supplies. The amount of unused capacity that the world can tap to produce more energy products is running out, warned top oil ministers. Referring to recent price spikes for refined products, Saudi Oil Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said at a Tuesday conference, ""I am a dinosaur, but I have never seen these things,"" according to Bloomberg. ""The world needs to wake up to an existing reality. The world is running out of energy capacity at all levels,"" he added. Prices for crude oil have surged more than 50% from a year ago to roughly $105 a barrel. But prices for refined products like diesel have soared even higher. In the US, diesel prices are up 78% to $5.50 a gallon, Bloomberg data shows. The United Arab Emirates' oil minister said OPEC+ may not be able to deliver on sufficient energy supplies down the line without more investments. ""We've been warning about the lack of investment,"" Suhail al Mazrouei said in an interview in Abu Dhabi, Bloomberg reported. ""That lack of investment is catching up with a lot of countries."" Mazrouei added that ""politicization"" of the oil market has pushed supply prices higher. Meanwhile, the European Union is weighing a full embargo on Russian oil in an attempt to ramp up economic pressure on Moscow for its war on Ukraine. In the event of the oil ban, one analyst predicted Russia would have to slash its oil production within ""a year or two.""

5/11/2022,"Ty Jones caught a rainbow trout with unique features in Spring Creek in Reliance, Tennessee. The Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency posted Jones' fish on its Facebook page. The trout weighed 4.3 pounds and measured 19.5 inches in length. Rainbow trout are native to the Pacific drainages of the western United States, but through extensive trout management during much of the 20th century the species has become the most widely distributed and abundant trout species in Tennessee, according to the TWRA. Rainbow trout were originally introduced into Tennessee in the late 1880s when logging practices destroyed the native brook trout habitat. Wild populations are now found in about 300 streams across East Tennessee. They can tolerate temperature slightly warmer than brook trout, preferring water temperature lower than 70 degrees.

5/11/2022,"Mark Esper said his refusal to affirm Trump's claims about Iranian threats upset several loyalists. In his memoir, Esper recalled an interview where Trump said four US embassies were being targeted. Esper wrote that he believed threats were possible but said reports didn't specify any set number. Former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper revealed in his newly-released memoir that allies of former President Donald Trump complained that he was ""not loyal"" after he did not back the former president's 2020 allegations that slain Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani had sought to target four US embassies for attack. In his new book, ""A Sacred Oath: Memoirs of a Secretary of Defense During Extraordinary Times,"" Esper — who served under Trump as Army secretary from 2017 to 2019 and in his aforementioned role as the Pentagon chief from 2019 until his November 2020 termination by the then-president — said his intelligence briefings did not indicate that Soleimani was specifically eyeing four embassies. While Esper was concerned about potential attacks, he didn't feel comfortable backing up Trump's assertions, which he detailed in the book — charging that the former president displayed a pattern of dishonesty. ""The simple fact was that Trump usually exaggerated and often made statements that could not be confirmed; others were outright fabrications. I became ensnared in one of those rhetorical webs on a Sunday morning talk show,"" the former defense chief wrote. Esper recalled in his book a January 2020 Fox News interview featuring Trump. The former president made allegations that the ex-defense secretary said weren't included in CIA intelligence reports. On January 10, just days after Soleimani had been killed by the US, ""Trump told Fox News that Soleimani planned to attack several diplomatic posts in the Middle East, remarking, 'I can reveal that I believe it probably would've been four embassies.' Not long before that, [Mike] Pompeo had told the media the United States didn't know when or where the attacks might occur, but acknowledged that embassies were threatened,"" he wrote. ""This was consistent with my understanding of the intelligence, the reports I was receiving, and precautionary actions we were taking,"" Esper continued. ""Embassy Baghdad was obviously under threat, and State had enough concerns about Embassy Beirut that we reinforced that site as well. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, the safety of our embassies in Kuwait and Bahrain concerned me."" The former defense secretary reiterated that while he agreed that there were still clear threats against embassies, Trump's claims about the four sites couldn't be supported, per reports that intelligence officials had seen. ""I didn't recall any specific mention of four sites in my briefings and reports from the CIA,"" he wrote. ""Therefore, when I first appeared on CNN on Sunday, January 12, I made two things clear: first, that I hadn't seen any specific evidence with regard to the targeting of four embassies; and second, that I still believed there were threats against multiple embassies, noting that we had reinforced earlier diplomatic posts."" He added: ""Regardless, my unwillingness to affirm Trump's specific claim that the intelligence said Soleimani targeted four embassies plunged me into hot water with the president. A trusted colleague told me that some of Trump's friends called to report on me, complaining that I was 'undermining' him and 'not loyal,' and even suggested he 'fire Esper' ... for being honest."" During Esper's January 2020 appearance on the CBS News program ""Face the Nation,"" the then-Defense secretary said that he ""didn't see"" anything in reports indicating that four embassies would be targeted, but still had the expectation that Iran ""was going to go after our embassies."" Soleimani was killed by a US drone strike near Iraq's Baghdad International Airport in January 2020. Trump was adamant that the threat to multiple embassies forced his hand in ordering the strike that eventually took down the longtime Iranian security and intelligence commander. The Trump administration never publicly provided clear evidence to support its claim that Soleimani posed an imminent threat to US personnel in the region and offered shifting justifications for the strike in the aftermath as congressional lawmakers questioned its legality. Soleimani was Iran's top general, the leader of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps' (IRGC) elite Quds force, and was widely considered the second most powerful person in the country after Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. His death came amid a period of heightened tensions between Washington and Tehran — linked to Trump's controversial decision to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal — and pushed the US and Iran to the brink of war. Iran retaliated with missile attacks on US forces in Iraq, which injured dozens. But both sides ultimately backed away from a broader conflict. The dynamic between the US and Iran remains contentious, which has impacted the Biden administration's efforts to revive the Iran nuclear deal. Trump withdrew from the Obama-era deal in May 2018, a move that saw US-Iran relations rapidly deteriorate. A representative for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider.

5/11/2022,"While on the campaign trail, Governor Greg Abbot (R-TX) slammed gubernatorial candidate Beto O’Rourke (D-TX) for O’Rourke’s stand on abortion, alleging O’Rourke “believes that a fully developed a baby, just seconds away from delivery, can still be aborted and killed.” Abbot delivered his inflammatory remarks in the wake of O’Rourke’s pro-choice rally in Houston. O’Rourke held the rally in support of abortion rights following the leaked Supreme Court draft opinion signaling the Court would overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark court case that established a woman’s constitutional right to have an abortion. If the draft of the majority opinion becomes final, states would have the authority to pass trigger laws to ban abortions. Governor Abbot already signed a trigger law in July 2021 that would make nearly all abortions a felony with no exceptions for women who become pregnant due to rape or incest. Abbot went on to say that O’Rourke’s stance on abortion “gets worse,” claiming that O’Rourke was also against legislation that would require a doctor to attend to a baby that survived an abortion.

5/11/2022,"Trump's former Pentagon chief details a significant effort to punish an impeachment witness. Mark Esper writes in a new book that the Trump White House went to great lengths to punish Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman. ""He's a Never Trumper. We need to get rid of him,"" Esper says Trump told him of Vindman. President Donald Trump and his White House engaged in a scorched earth campaign to purge Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman from the US military after Vindman became a key witness during Trump's first impeachment, Trump's former Pentagon chief details in a new book. ""'He lied about my great call,''"" Trump reportedly told then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper during an April 21, 2020 White House meeting, according to Esper's new book, ""A Sacred Oath: Memoirs of a Secretary of Defense During Extraordinary Times."" Esper goes on to claim that Trump added, ""[Vindman] made it all up. He's a Never Trumper. We need to get rid of him."" Esper's book includes new allegations of the White House effort to derail Vindman's career and block his Pentagon-endorsed promotion to colonel, with Trump's chief of staff at one point shouting at Esper that the Army combat veteran and Purple Heart recipient will ""never get promoted."" Vindman responded to an early excerpt by tweeting out a photo of an angry Trump. At the time, Vindman was a National Security Council staffer detailed to the White House. His shock and abhorrence to Trump's July 25, 2019 call with Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy was a major point in what became the first impeachment against the president for pressuring Ukraine to investigate then-former Vice President Joe Biden and his family. It was Vindman who insisted the White House record of the call should mention Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company on whose board Biden's son Hunter had served. Trump, who was later acquitted by the GOP-controlled Senate, has never budged from his defense that it was a ""perfect phone call"" and that his request for Zelenskyy ""to do us a favor"" in return for military aid Trump ordered withheld was in no way evidence of a quid-pro-quo. Vindman retired from the military after Trump's acquittal in the face of a massive pressure campaign. While some of these details were previously known, Esper meticulously documents alleged meetings and phone calls with Trump and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows that underline the effort to punish Vindman. Both Vindman and his brother Yevgeny were fired from the National Security Council days after Trump's acquittal. Yevgeny Vindman wrote on Twitter that Esper's lack of support ""allowed our actions to be politicized."" He said he would join his brother in retirement later this summer. Esper writes that the White House's lust for revenge was not satiated with the Vindmans being ousted from the White House. Meadows, Esper claims, was engaged in an effort to deny Vindman a proposed promotion, strongly implying that the White House would find more witnesses to support a misconduct complaint filed against Vindman. Esper takes particular issue with Meadows' handling of the complaint. Esper wrote that it became evident early on ""that the NSC had no real evidence or witnesses to offer."" Esper says this was later confirmed by an Army inspector general investigation. But Meadows, Esper wrote, wasn't done yet. Neither side could drag out the issue forever as the Pentagon had to submit Vindman and other prospective promotions to the Senate for approval. In July 2020, the showdown Esper says he was expecting all along over Vindman's future finally came to a head. ""I told Meadows, 'Yes, the Army was done ...,"" Esper wrote of a July 6, 2020 call. ""'Then why didn't you call me, Secretary? I would have had them get you something,'"" Esper wrote that Meadows shouted back. Meadows then asked for ""another week or so"" in what Esper described as an effort ""to drum up more witnesses"" for the complaint. Esper said that he again refused to drag out the process any longer. ""'If you don't want him on the list, then you should remove him, but I don't support it. It would be the wrong thing to do,'"" I yelled into the phone. Meadows shouted back, 'He'll never get promoted!'"" Esper wrote that Meadows asked for and received a White House meeting the following day to discuss the situation. Flanked by Pentagon lawyers, Esper laid out the case that there was no credible evidence to deny Vindman a promotion. Esper said that Meadows finally relented in part due to a White House lawyer telling him that he could be accused of tampering with the investigation if he pressed too hard. Spokespersons for Meadows and Vindman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump blasted Esper ahead of the book's publication, calling his former Pentagon chief ""Yesper"" and arguing that he was so ineffective that Trump himself had to effectively run the US military.

5/11/2022,"A long-haul truck driver was arrested Saturday night on suspicion of raping a clerk at the motel he was staying at in Turlock. The incident occurred around 8:25 p.m. at the Days Inn on North Tully Road, said Turlock police Lt. Neil Cervenka. The suspect, 29-year-old Osman Mukhammadiyev, called the front desk to report an “equipment problem” in his room. A female employee responded to the room, where Mukhammadiyev allegedly restrained her and sexually assaulted her, Cervenka said. He said the victim was able to fight off the suspect, run back to the hotel office and call 911. Cervenka said officers quickly arrived at the scene and apprehended Mukhammadiyev as he was coming out of his room. He was arrested on suspicion of forcible rape, kidnapping to commit rape and false imprisonment. His bail is set at $670,000 and he has not yet been formally charged. A woman at the Days Inn who identified herself as the assistant manager declined to comment about the incident when contacted by The Bee on Monday. Cervenka said Mukhammadiyev is a long-haul trucker from Massachusetts who’d been staying at the motel for a few days. “We don’t know if he has ever been in this area before; we have no history at all with him,” the lieutenant said. “Investigators have a concern that this may have happened in other areas or states due the the nature of his job and the nature of the offense,” Cervenka said. “We urge anyone with information to come forward.” Anyone with information is asked to contact Detective Tony Argueta at 209-668-6538.",U.S./Modesto Bee,Turlock hotel clerk allegedly raped by guest who reported equipment issue in his room,https://news.yahoo.com/turlock-hotel-clerk-allegedly-raped-194600857.html
5/11/2022,"(Reuters) - Four Russian regional governors resigned on Tuesday as the country braces for the impact of economic sanctions. The heads of the Tomsk, Saratov, Kirov and Mari El regions announced their immediate departures from office, while the head of Ryazan region said he would not run for another term. Elections are scheduled to take place in all five regions in September. Though Russian regional governors are elected, they are politically subordinate to the Kremlin. Several of the outgoing governors represent regions where the ruling bloc United Russia took weak vote shares in parliamentary elections last year. Unpopular governors are regularly removed from office, often submitting their resignations in clusters in the spring months. Ilya Grashchenkov, head of the Centre for the Development of Regional Politics think tank in Moscow, said the Kremlin was removing weak governors amid a worsening economic outlook for the country, driven by Western sanctions. Grashchenkov said: “There’s a need to restructure the economy, especially in those regions where Western economic influence had been significant. These governors need to be replaced by younger alternatives.” The Russian economy is set to contract by 8.8% in 2022, the economy ministry has said.
