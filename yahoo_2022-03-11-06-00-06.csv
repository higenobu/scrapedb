3/11/2022,"BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — A man caught on video killing his estranged wife may leave prison early to live with his sister in Las Vegas, the Louisiana Parole Board has decided. The board voted unanimously Wednesday to release Anthony Knox, 59, of Leesville even though he denied killing Army Staff Sgt. Angela Knox, 32, in 1997 and said he was coerced into pleading guilty to manslaughter, the American Press reported. Knox has served 24-and-a-half years of a 40-year sentence. Police said when he was arrested that a security camera showed him knocking her to the ground, then standing over her and shooting her point-blank in the head and chest. He must keep taking psychiatric medications and regularly see mental health professionals in Nevada, the board said. All three members said they approved Knox’s early release largely because psychiatric professionals testified that he recently had requested a change from a daily pill to a bi-monthly injection. After his arrest, Knox was placed in the state psychiatric hospital for defendants found mentally incompetent for trial, and later diagnosed with schizophrenia. He was found competent in 2001 and pleaded guilty in 2005 to manslaughter. Knox said he did not have schizophrenia and had only been diagnosed with delusions. And, he said, “I was abused and forced into a plea agreement under false charges.” “Actually I’m not guilty of the crime,” he told the parole board. He said he was present but did not know what happened. Nobody mentioned the security footage, the newspaper reported. Mental health professionals testified they considered Knox would do best in a group home in Louisiana, but Knox’s sister said she could care for him. Board member Tony Marabella asked Knox if he would take his medication as prescribed and listen to mental health professionals as they diagnose and treat him, and Knox answered he would. Arrest reports said Knox was served with divorce documents and a restraining order July 30, 1997, and followed her to a Walmart in Leesville two days later, waiting in his vehicle while she went in. When she began loading bags into her vehicle at 4:55 a.m., Knox came up from behind and hit her in the face with the pistol, authorities said. Vernon Parish District Attorney Terry Lambright wrote to the parole board in January, strongly opposing Knox’s request for release. “Our state should not be releasing individuals that intentionally kill another person, except in very exceptional cases. This case is not exceptional. Anthony Knox should have remained in prison to serve his prison sentence,” Lambright told the newspaper Wednesday.",U.S./Associated Press,Louisiana man who killed wife released to sister in Nevada,https://news.yahoo.com/louisiana-man-killed-wife-released-185002984.html
3/11/2022,"Amid the coverage of attacks on Ukraine by Russian forces, those with ties to other countries in conflict are raising questions about inequalities in public response. A series of clips are circulating on social media in which broadcasters and interviewees on major platforms make statements that seemingly paint Ukrainian victims of tragedy as more sympathetic than non-European victims. In one BBC interview, Ukraine’s Deputy Chief Prosecutor David Sakvarelidze is quoted remarking on how the current tragedy is “very emotional” because he sees “European people with blue eyes and blonde hair being killed."" Similarly, a Telegraph op-ed by writer and former politician Daniel Hannan begins by stating that what makes the Russian invasion so shocking is that its victims “seem so like us.” Hannan specifically highlights that these victims are European: “War is no longer something visited upon impoverished and remote populations.” In response to these statements, members of the public are questioning the increased empathy and public support afforded to European victims, in contrast to the minimizing of atrocities that impact non-European countries. Matt Duss, a Ukrainian-American foreign policy advisor to U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, spoke out on social media about the disparity he witnessed in public response. “As a Ukrainian-American I am immensely proud of the bravery of Ukrainians and of the support being shown by Americans,” he wrote on Twitter. “As a Middle East analyst I am floored by the blatant double standard on resisting occupation and repression.” Megan Boler is a professor in the Department of Social Justice Education at the University of Toronto. Her research specialties include the politics of digital and social media, and the role of race, class, and gender in education and media. “To me, it’s a very shocking contrast to the representation of war in other places,” Boler told Yahoo News Canada. Boler said she is “acutely aware” of how different periods of media representation have changed the public’s access to war, and shaped the view of the public. The people who are saying these things seem to be marked by their own racial identity and privilege. I find it really shocking that commentators would make these kinds of statements that are so utterly degrading to the tragedies of what has happened to people in other war-torn areas, most recently Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan.Megan Boler, Professor in the Department of Social Justice Education at the University of Toronto In one such video, a television presenter mentions the use of thermobaric bombs — massively destructive vacuum bombs that can completely annihilate anyone in the area. He acknowledges that these bombs have by the United States in Afghanistan in the past. “But,” he says, “the idea of it being used in Europe is stomach-churning.” Some of Boler’s academic research focused on the 2003 American invasion of Iraq, and she noted the favourable attitudes towards this invasion being promoted at the time: “The propaganda at the time was just incredible, it was just outrageous.” “Anyone who opposed the U.S. invasion was seen as a traitor,” she said. “The representation of people in Iraq did not represent people as human. We really got very little coverage.” Due to the economic differences between Ukraine and Syria, Boler acknowledged that those on the ground in Ukraine have increased capability to show the public the reality of war. However, she does not believe this is the sole cause of increased public attention. Even if those in Syria had this capability, she does not necessarily believe there would have been increased empathy. There wasn’t public attention on what was happening to that population. Because they were brown, because many of them were Muslim, and because they were not people who were valued in our society, or in our political landscape.Megan Boler, Professor in the Department of Social Justice Education at the University of Toronto Boler added that the double standard can be seen beyond the headlines. “We might even think about how that perception, or that racism, is infusing the global response at the national level, in terms of nations that are stepping up to take action.” “It’s not just at the level of individuals and individual reporters whose racism is being exposed, but also essentially whose life is valued at the level of international global political discourse,” she said. Boler highlighted that just as social media platforms these perspectives, it also provides an avenue for accountability. “We will begin to see that there is just a profound racism that shapes news coverage,” she said. “Social media is going to be able to call out the racism in news coverage, and that is an upside of hearing these outrageous comments.”",News/Yahoo News Canada,"'Utterly degrading': Ukraine war coverage reveals devastating truth about which lives are globally valued, expert says",https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-war-bias-coverage-russia-putin-193028640.html

3/11/2022,"Madison Cawthorn seems to love getting people wound up. He’s only been in the spotlight for a few years — and an elected official for just over a year — yet he manages to generate enough scandal to stay in state and national headlines seemingly every week. On Thursday, WRAL shared a video of him calling Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky a “thug” to his supporters at an event last weekend. He also says Ukraine “is incredibly corrupt and is incredibly evil and has been pushing woke ideologies.” Cawthorn tried to walk those comments back after WRAL broke the story Wednesday, posting on his congressional Twitter account that “the actions of Putin and Russia are disgusting. But leaders, including Zelensky, should NOT push misinformation on America.” His message, however, seems to reject America entering the fight altogether. And his villainization of Zelensky is akin to rhetoric coming from Russian officials. President Vladimir Putin has attempted to justify his invasion of Ukraine by framing it as a “special operation” to “protect people who have been abused by the genocide of the Kyiv regime.” Putin has also suggested that Ukraine is run by Nazis, despite the fact that Zelensky is himself Jewish. Cawthorn’s comments are not only out of step with what Americans overwhelmingly feel about Ukraine; they’re also a departure from most of his fellow Republicans. As reports of Cawthorn’s remarks surfaced Wednesday, the Republican-led N.C. House of Representatives was unanimously voting on a resolution of support for Ukraine. House Speaker Tim Moore told The News & Observer that Cawthorn’s comments are “unfortunate.” “We need to very clearly condemn someone who’s a bad actor like Vladimir Putin, and everything I’m seeing about Zelensky is, this is a guy who cares about his country, and is literally putting his life on the line,” Moore told The N&O. It isn’t clear what Cawthorn is thinking. It’s possible he has a soft spot for Vladimir Putin, given the similarities in their hyper-nationalistic rhetoric. It’s also possible he wants to once again mimic former president Donald Trump, who expressed an early admiration for Putin’s invasion. But even Trump has since read the room on what America feels about Russia and Ukraine, which leads us to believe that maybe Cawthorn was speaking without thinking much at all. It wouldn’t be the first time.",Politics/Raleigh News and Observer,Madison Cawthorn calls Zelensky a ‘thug’?

3/11/2022,"STORY: Russian President Vladimir Putin warned on Thursday (March 10) that Russia would ultimately emerge stronger and more independent after the West imposed what he called illegitimate sanctions. Addressing a government meeting, Putin also said Moscow - which is a major energy producer- would continue to meet its contractual obligations. And he said the Western sanctions would prove self-defeating: ""We know it well. They urge their citizens to tighten their belts, dress warmer and point to the sanctions they impose on us as a reason for their deteriorating situation. "" Hitting back against the West, the Russian government said earlier it had banned exports of telecoms, medical, auto, agricultural, electrical and tech equipment, among other items, until the end of the year. In total, over 200 items were included on the export suspension list, which also covered railway cars, containers and turbines. Earlier on Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also said that Russia's economy was experiencing a shock and that measures were being taken to soften the blow from the raft of far-reaching sanctions. ""The situation is totally unprecedented. The economic war that has started against our country has never taken place before. So it is very hard to forecast anything. One needs not to forecast, but to act to minimise the negative consequences and further risks. "" The UK sanctioned seven more oligarchs it links to the Kremlin on Thursday. That follows 14 sanctioned by the EU on Wednesday (March 9).",Politics/Reuters Videos,Putin warns: Russia will emerge stronger,https://news.yahoo.com/putin-warns-russia-emerge-stronger-171710509.html
