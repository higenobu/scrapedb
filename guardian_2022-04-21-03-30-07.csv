4/21/2022,"The looks on the Tory frontbench said it all. Dominic Raab, Alok Sharma, Liz Truss and Sajid Javid could barely bring themselves to even glance at Boris Johnson. Their eyes were dead, their faces expressionless. Just wishing they were anywhere but in the Commons for prime minister’s questions. Beam me up. Realising they were stuck in their leader’s own nightmare. Partygate wasn’t going away any time soon. It would be with them for months yet. Slowly dragging everyone down with it. The Convict’s shame was now their shame. Johnson was keen to move on. He was desperate to talk about the cost of living crisis – even though it’s getting worse by the day under his government. At this rate, half the country will be eating from food banks by the end of the year. That’s if anyone can afford to use a cooker. Anything but focus on his own criminality. Boris had made an apology of sorts the evening before. It had been devoid of any real contrition, but so what? It would have to do. Real repentance would suggest a desire to change. And he felt no such thing. All The Convict was really sorry for was having got caught. The law was never meant for people like him. But it was never going to work out so easily for Johnson. There would be more fines for far more serious offences. Tory MPs who had gone out on a limb to defend him for his birthday party – the kind of gathering that the prime minister had said was illegal on an almost nightly basis during his lockdown press conferences – would now find themselves thrown under a bus as they were asked to explain all the other piss-ups. Keir Starmer was in no mood to let Johnson off the hook. He began with a simple question. One to which he knew The Convict had no answer. Why had he accepted Allegra Stratton’s resignation? If there had never been any parties, as he had frequently told MPs, why was there any need for her to leave No 10? Boris mumbled incoherently and tugged The Toddler Haircut. His face was pasty and he was looking like carrion. It’s a surprise no one has suggested he goes for his own good, never mind the country’s. This was a visceral cross-examination. The Labour leader used to try to keep PMQs on a strictly professional working basis. The forensic semi-detached lawyer. But now he makes no attempt to conceal his hatred and contempt for Johnson. It drips like acid from every sentence. And is all the more deadly for it. It’s not the rambling, shambolic dislike that Boris has for Starmer and anyone else who dares challenge him. It’s directed with laser precision. After listing others who had paid for their rule-breaking with their jobs, Starmer returned to Johnson’s behaviour the previous day. Having put on a show for the TV cameras in the Commons of apologising for having been found guilty of breaking the law – it’s still not clear if he really believes he broke a law, or if he thinks the law applies to him – he showed his true colours in a private meeting of Tory MPs. The struggle of being on his best behaviour for two hours had been too much and The Convict had let rip. He’d never really been guilty of anything. The rules were stupid and he’d be sure to give a piece of his mind to whoever had made them. Worst of all were the BBC and the archbishop of Canterbury, who had been tougher on the government’s immigration policy than they had on Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Johnson confected outrage. Starmer was nothing but a Corbynista in an Islington suit, he blustered. It still didn’t work when he tried the line a second time. No one believes Starmer is a Corbynista and it was Johnson who used to own the £3.75m Islington house. Up until the point he got slung out for having yet another affair. Lying and deceit are The Convict’s life-blood. He then did a bit of PR for the Rwandan tourist board. The country was basically one big holiday camp and if his plan did have a fault, it was that refugees would be clogging up Kent beaches in their desperation to get a free air ticket to Kigali. But even then, the Rwandans would be thrilled to get so many immigrants. It was almost as if he believed that immigration could be beneficial to a country. Then The Convict turned his attention to the BBC. He had never said the BBC was biased in its journalism. It had just been a story invented by the … er, Daily Telegraph. Tell that to the prime minister’s press spokesperson, who briefed the hacks. Tory MPs who had only just got used to the idea that the Beeb were evil lefties who should have the licence fee withdrawn looked understandably nonplussed by this sudden reversal but chose to roll with it. Everything was a lie, he insisted. He had been slandered. The irony of Boris accusing others of lying didn’t escape anyone. By now Johnson was careering out of control and he barely survived the rest of the session as one opposition MP after another pointed out that he couldn’t be trusted to tell the truth about anything. Even the most vocal Tory backbenchers fell silent as it gradually dawned on them that their champion was now their liability. They just wanted it all to stop. But it had barely just begun. There was only one ending to this. And it wouldn’t be pretty for The Convict.",News/Politics,Starmer makes no attempt to conceal his hatred and contempt for The Convict,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/20/starmer-makes-no-attempt-to-conceal-his-hatred-and-contempt-for-the-convict
4/21/2022,"When Graham Phillips first moved from London to Ukraine, the Nottingham-born civil servant set up a personal blog that mixed reviews of brothels with observations about everyday life in Kyiv. A decade later, the pro-Kremlin YouTuber finds himself accused in parliament of potential war crimes after interviewing a fellow Briton captured by the Russian army. Prime minister Boris Johnson told MPs he was concerned by Phillips’ “propaganda messages” featuring Aiden Aslin, a British national who has spent the last four years living in Ukraine and serving with the country’s armed forces. Aslin’s local MP Robert Jenrick went further, saying Phillips’ video showed his constituent “handcuffed, physically injured and being interviewed under duress for propaganda purposes”. He said it was a breach of the Geneva conventions on the treatment of prisoners of war and that “the interviewer Graham Phillips is in danger of prosecution for war crimes”. Aslin was captured by Russian forces while defending the besieged city of Mariupol, although it remains unclear how he ended up being interviewed by Phillips. The two men are both originally from Nottinghamshire: 28-year-old Aslin hails from the town of Newark-on-Trent, just a short drive outside Phillips’ home city. Yet it took a conflict on the other side of Europe to bring them together – albeit on different sides. While Aslin moved to Ukraine, met a local woman and joined the country’s armed forces, Phillips took a very different route and has long been a favoured mouthpiece for pro-Russian breakaway governments in the Donbas region. He has received medals from the Russian state for his reporting and toed the Russian line, suggesting in recent weeks that Ukraine is run by Nazis and the massacre of Ukrainians in Bucha was staged. Phillips insists his work is self-funded and regularly solicits donations from his 264,000 YouTube subscribers, but he also earns money from YouTube adverts paid for by major western companies. On Wednesday morning people attempting to watch Phillips’ potentially Geneva conventions-infringing interview with Aslin were greeted with paid-for adverts featuring Piers Morgan talking about his show on the forthcoming TalkTV channel and promotions for Müller yoghurt. YouTube has so far declined to take down Phillips’ videos, despite calls from politicians to remove the channel. His rise from obscure Brit abroad to figure of national political interest was unlikely. According to a 2014 interview with BuzzFeed News, Phillips first went to Ukraine when travelling as an away fan to an England football match. Aged 30, he quit his job at the now defunct government Central Office of Information and moved full-time to the country where he reinvented himself as a journalist. When Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, Phillips found himself drawn to the country’s pro-Moscow separatist groups in the east of the country. His prolific self-recorded clips on YouTube were a relative novelty at the time and delighted Russia, with the Kremlin-backed RT news channel briefly using him as a freelance journalist – although he never gained full-time employment with the outlet. His detention by the Ukrainian government on the outskirts of Mariupol gained him notoriety, but he soon slipped out of the public eye as western interest in the conflict receded. His uploads became infrequent, often focusing on visits to Crimea, and he attracted only a few thousand views. One clip saw him boast about being the only western journalist to attend a tour of Russia’s “legendary Black Sea fleet” and taking a small boat to look at the power of the flagship Moskva. That flagship has since sunk, appearing to have been hit by Ukrainian missiles. During the pandemic Phillips was in the UK, filming himself at anti-Black Lives Matter protests in central London. As recently as February, he uploaded a video in central London opposite the Houses of Parliament. The level of scaffolding on the Elizabeth Tower suggests it was recorded at the same time, meaning he was in Britain when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began. He subsequently managed to return to Russian-held areas of Ukraine, despite few airlines flying to the region, becoming one of the few western individuals filming videos from the occupied territory alongside Russian forces. How he ended up in a room interviewing Aslin remains unclear – although it has given him the profile he has always seemed to crave.",News/World news,"Who is Graham Phillips, the YouTuber accused of ‘war crimes’?",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/20/who-is-graham-phillips-the-youtuber-accused-of-war-crimes
4/21/2022,"Before escaping on an official visit to India on Wednesday, Boris Johnson ensured that headlines were dominated by his spurious attacks on the archbishop of Canterbury and the BBC, rather than his own egregious behaviour during Partygate. Deflection and bluster are, increasingly, what gets Mr Johnson through the day. This strategy of evasion is usually complemented by an earnest plea that he should be allowed to get on with delivering the priorities of the British people. At Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions, “fixing the energy crisis” was identified as one of the key areas Mr Johnson could focus on, if only people stopped harping on about him flouting the Covid laws he set. The prime minister at least alighted on the right issue to make his rhetorical point. But far more than the usual Johnsonian cant will be needed to deal with the truly alarming scale and implications of spiralling fuel costs. Testifying to MPs on Tuesday, the CEOs of Britain’s major energy companies reported unprecedented levels of calls from customers who fear they will not be able to pay their bills. Further vertiginous price rises in October – when Ofgem is expected to again raise the price cap – could place 40% of households in fuel poverty. In the words of the CEO of ScottishPower, Keith Anderson: “It has got to a stage now where the size and scale of it is beyond … what this industry can deal with. I think it needs a massive shift … in the government policy and approach.” There is naturally an element of industry self-interest here: energy bosses have no wish to be exposed to bad debts during a crisis that the money-saving expert Martin Lewis has warned could lead to civil unrest. But the central thrust of the CEOs’ analysis, shared by fuel poverty campaigners, is entirely correct: a perfect storm of economic factors, primarily related to the pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine, requires significant government intervention to protect people from the consequences of a broken market. This could be some kind of deficit fund to help poorer households, as proposed by Mr Anderson, or another form of subsidy. But as families face unsustainable headwinds, proper economic support is imperative. At the same time, if the country is to meet its net zero obligations, the government must be more proactive in shaping a green transition that can cut bills by reducing energy use. Labour’s promotion of a £60bn scheme to insulate homes shows what could be done by a government without ideological hang-ups regarding state intervention. In Italy, where the government has offered a 110% tax credit on energy-efficient home renovations, 150,000 new jobs have been created since 2020. There is no evidence that Mr Johnson or his beleaguered chancellor, Rishi Sunak, wish to engage with any of this. Instead, the government has chosen to offer minimal support to vulnerable households, and temporary rebates based on the flawed assumption that the fuel price rises amount to a short-term spike. Its recently published energy strategy – delayed as Mr Sunak haggled over the cost – conveniently focused on long-term nuclear goals which may or may not be realised, ignoring the current cost-of-living crunch altogether. If Mr Johnson really wishes to “deliver on the people’s priorities”, his administration will need to snap out of its siege mentality, stop seeking out bogus dividing lines and get ahead of this crisis before it is too late.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on spiralling fuel bills: Johnson must get a grip | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/20/the-guardian-view-on-spiralling-fuel-bills-johnson-must-get-a-grip
4/21/2022,"Even by the standards of China’s overzealous censors, suppressing a hashtag that simply quoted its national anthem was striking stuff. The opening line – “Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves!” – had been deployed to express the growing anger and distress in Shanghai as what was supposed to be a short, sharp lockdown stretched on for weeks, with gruelling results for individuals as well as damaging effects on the economy. On Wednesday the city eased restrictions somewhat, with millions allowed to leave home for the first time in weeks. Yet even if the worst proves to be over in the financial centre, experiencing China’s biggest outbreak since the virus first emerged in Wuhan, concerns about the country’s insistence on a zero-Covid strategy will persist. Outside China, the attention has been on the draconian nature of restrictions, with reports of the separation of small children from their parents, people dying from other medical problems because they could not access help, and the beating to death of a dog whose owner had apparently been sent to a quarantine centre. Plenty in China have lambasted the inhumanity, but it is also the inefficiency of authorities which has shocked. An international, sophisticated metropolis is asking why officials insisted there would be no lockdown until the last minute, leaving residents no time to prepare; why the testing and isolation process appears beset by confusion; why conditions are so poor in crowded quarantine centres; and why food is in such short supply. Officials have admitted “difficulties”. Delivery remains at the centre of the party’s legitimacy, even if nationalism has become an increasingly potent force. Many citizens looked at the huge death tolls elsewhere and concluded that zero-Covid was the right course. China was the first major economy to reopen and grow; much of the country has gone about its business as usual since last spring. For obvious reasons it is very hard to gauge public opinion – still less what that opinion might be without the omnipresent censorship and propaganda. But Edelman research suggests that trust levels in the central government in early 2022 were the highest in a decade. Shanghai’s experiences have cracked the glossy surface of authoritarian competence. To let the virus loose now, with low vaccination rates among older people, and reliance on the less effective domestically produced vaccine, would be likely to result in significant disruption and death. Because China’s death toll is so extraordinarily low – due in part to the manner of reporting – many people see less reason to be vaccinated, but also less reason to be locked down. At least some residents are asking whether, thanks to vaccines, there is a wiser middle path between letting the virus rip and attempting elimination, which seems increasingly futile thanks to the highly transmissible Omicron variant. But Xi Jinping’s personal endorsement of zero Covid, and the expectation that he will break precedent by claiming a third term as China’s leader at this year’s party congress, makes a change of course look extraordinarily unlikely before then. Stability is all. Shanghai’s struggle is not an existential issue for the party. It has survived far worse. But about 45 cities – many large, but less well-known and well-connected – are under some form of lockdown. Each one is likely to erode a little further the confidence of citizens. The zero-Covid strategy comes at a cost for the leadership as well as those it rules.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on China’s zero-Covid strategy: no way out? | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/20/the-guardian-view-on-shanghais-lockdown-the-costs-of-zero-covid
4/21/2022,"My partner has been emailing and having phone conversations with a former female friend. She contacted him (which he told me about at the time) and they’ve been emailing daily since – he did not divulge their continued correspondence. I found out because I glanced down at his phone whilst we were in bed a couple of weeks ago and saw a message saying “Morning Sweetpea xx” from her to him. We have had difficult times in the past with him lying and having “private” conversations with former girlfriends, colleagues etc, but only the night before he’d said how lovely it was to be able to be honest and open and have nothing hidden, and it was the first time he’d been in that position in a relationship. I feel sad and disappointed and have lost respect for him. He says that my behaviour (being quiet and withdrawn) is only hurting me. He seems to have a different understanding of “open and honest” and doesn’t think he’s acted in opposition to that because it’s platonic (she lives quite a long way away and lives with her partner). But I think he kept it a secret and if it was purely platonic, he would have told me. I was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer last year (and I know that it’s difficult for him as well as me) but since then he’s had “platonic” contact with three female colleagues and this former friend. He’s very affectionate, loving and kind. How do I get past this, and should I? Eleanor says: As a pretty good rule: someone who doesn’t know they’re doing anything wrong doesn’t know to keep it a secret. I remember reading about a therapist who’d worked with hundreds of post-affair couples in a career that spanned back to the 60s, when most affairs started in the office. She said the moment worth paying attention to isn’t the first touch or the first kiss. It’s the first time people keep a secret from their partners. One person says something to the other that they’d prefer their partner never heard, or conspires to conceal where they really were or why they went. The secret creates a sealed bubble that their partner isn’t let into – a relationship with someone else underpinned by the mutual knowledge that the space between them is secret; private. Whether or not those two people ever kiss, something interesting has already happened. Something stands in need of explanation. Of course, sometimes the explanation is just that the partner at home is sufficiently jealous that being candid about innocent contact still feels like too much of a risk. But that doesn’t sound like what’s going on here. You say this has been an issue several times already. You know what I know – people say good morning when they’re in fairly constant contact; they use affectionate names like “sweetpea” when they’re being affectionate. This is causing you enough consternation to want to write to me. To me, it sounds like he’s stoking a crush in a way he knows you’d be unhappy about. That doesn’t automatically mean that he or the relationship aren’t worth your time. Conflicts like this happen, and can be worked on. But you’ve had a huge ordeal with your diagnosis recently and you’re entitled to be judicious about how much of anything you “work on” just now. In particular, it would be a real shame if you keep being the only person in this relationship who recognises a flirtation for what it is. There are all kinds of open conversations you could have about why he wants to do this – maybe he likes the flattery, maybe he wants to feel young and unattached to combat the fear of being neither, maybe you’re right to notice some connection with your diagnosis. But – and this is important – these are not yours to figure out alone. If you’re trying to understand this while he’s six blocks behind you denying that there’s anything puzzling, that won’t work, and it isn’t fair. Perhaps a place to start is to ask yourself: If this never changed or kept recurring, would you want to stay in the relationship? If the answer is “no”, the next question is: will he work with you to honour that preference? Getting stuck in an empirical back-and-forth won’t help either of you. The question isn’t what exactly is right or wrong by the technical letters of monogamy. The question is whether this relationship can be one where you both feel safe and cared for.

4/21/2022,"“I’m sitting in the box, [Cristiano] Ronaldo’s family’s box, next to Georgina, his wife, watching the game,” says Alistair Edwards. “And then after the game Ronaldo comes in and he invites us to his house, so you go to his house. So it’s in those times I think, ‘yeah, life has been pretty good’.” That would seem an understatement, especially in the context of the Australian coach’s inglorious exit from Perth Glory in 2013. And in the past few years, life has indeed been pretty good. Edwards has been almost a forgotten man in A-League Men’s coaching circles since his stint in charge of the Glory ended prematurely due to a difference in views between he and owner Tony Sage over the direction of the club. Not that he has any regrets. He has since visited Ronaldo’s house in Turin – when the Portuguese star played for Juventus – and wines and dines with super agent Jorge Mendes in high-end Barcelona restaurants. Perhaps the biggest surprise in all of this is not the fact Edwards enjoying such an existence, it is that he is doing so because he is the technical director of a club not in Europe but Asia. Malaysian side Johor Darul Ta’zim, better known around the continent as JDT, is the very definition of a super club. Within the space of a decade they have transformed themselves from a state-owned, middle-of-the-road Malaysian Super League club to one of the true glamour outfits of Asian football. Rolls Royce limousines, private jets and pre-season tours in Dubai – everything JDT does screams luxury and excess. To understand the size and scale of this new powerhouse, simply watch its recently produced anthem, Pioneers. The music video’s frontman? Snoop Dogg. The sight of the iconic West Coast rapper in a JDT kit dropping lyrics like “I’m in it like JDT S N double O P bout to kick it on fresh grass” feels like a trick on the eyes. But it is not, because this is JDT. And it is all due to the vision – and let’s be honest, the money – of one man: Tunku Ismail ibni Sultan Ibrahim, the Crown Prince of Johor. Better known as TMJ, he is a man with a contact book as thick as any in world football and who counts Ronaldo as a personal friend. TMJ had the funds and the plan, and one of the first people he tasked with executing it was Edwards, a former player of the old Johor FA team in the 1990s and something of a legend in the oil-rich southern Malaysian state bordering Singapore. Edwards was entranced by his vision and ambition, but knew Malaysian football well enough to come at it with a healthy dose of scepticism. “Because when he talked about what he wanted to do,” Edwards says, “like dominate Malaysian football, build the best infrastructure in Asia, play in the Asian Champions League; when you’re looking at a Malaysian team, to play in the Champions League has never been done before. “And when I was here, in the 1990s, nothing much had changed from that [time] in terms of the football. Everything was the same, the way it’s run and everything. It wasn’t really moving, but TMJ was starting to move it. So when he was explained to me what his plans were, they looked incredible.” The club’s home ground, Larkin Stadium, was dilapidated. Soon enough it was completely refurbished, inside and out, into one of the best in Southeast Asia. Plans were unveiled for a 40,000-seat, state-of-the-art stadium the likes of which Malaysia had not seen before, and in 2020 the Sultan Ibrahim Stadium opened. This month the venue will host Group I of the AFC Champions League, which sees JDT pitted against continental giants Kawasaki Frontale, Ulsan Hyundai and Guangzhou Evergrande. In their opening game on the weekend, under manager Benjamin Mora, they beat Chinese Super League side Guangzhou 5-0. On Monday night they stunned South Korea’s 2020 champions Ulsan 2-1, and sit top of the group entering Friday night’s third match against J1 League leaders Kawasaki This stadium and this stage is where JDT, champions for eight straight seasons in Malaysia, now comfortably sit. Edwards’s role at the club has changed over the years. Similarly to when he worked for Football Federation Australia as Joeys coach, much has centred around creating and developing the academy structures to develop a pipeline of talent – one that is showing early signs of bearing fruit. “We set up the academy from basically scratch,” 53-year-old Edwards says. “So now we have an academy from under-12s all the way through our under-21s … it’s a proper academy in terms of the players come in at 11 years old and they live there, they go to school there, they have all the nutritionists and everything.” “Our JDT II team, which is playing in the second division, 12 of the players in the squad are from the academy. In our first team there’s four players that are regularly training with the first team and three of them regularly playing, like Arif Aiman. [He’s] the youngest in our group [and] he’s amazing. He’s 19 years old, we plucked him up when he was 15 or 16 from the national program here, where he was playing in the second team, by the way. “So we bought him in here and he played in our under-19 team and JDT II, and to cut a long story short he was probably our best player last year and he’s 19 years old. So that’s the kind of thing that is happening because of all the great work that TMJ has done.” As glowing as Edwards is of TMJ, the same is true in reverse. “He’s a legend in Johor football,” the Crown Prince says, “and has been contributing to the system for a very long time, both as a player and now technical director. Him being in the organisation inspires many young people at the club to do well. “As technical director, he is key to our youth development programme and keeps a keen eye on our JDT academy, which has grown tremendously in recent years.”",Sport/Football,"Cristiano Ronaldo, Snoop Dogg and Asia's glamour club – the second coming of Alistair Edwards | Paul Williams",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/21/cristiano-ronaldo-snoop-dogg-and-asias-glamour-club-the-second-coming-of-alistair-edwards
4/21/2022,"The National party’s candidate for the marginal northern New South Wales seat of Richmond told worshippers at a Pentecostal church that her “ultimate goal” in politics was to “bring God’s kingdom to the political arena”. The comments by the endorsed Nationals candidate, Kimberly Hone, have emerged alongside a series of old social media posts described by her opponents as “repulsive”, and include a post from 2017 that says “one way to avoid domestic violence is to marry well” with a broken Facebook link. Hone’s past Twitter posts include articles that describe transgender surgery as “mutilation”; articles questioning the parenting abilities of lesbian couples; articles that question human-made global heating; and claims in 2014 that “integration has failed”. Hone appears to have deleted dozens of detailed blogs and videos on these same issues, but some Twitter posts remain online. On the National party’s website, Hone is described as “the mother of three young girls and a small businesswoman”. The profile does not mention the enterprise she runs with her husband is a “ministry” that advises Christians in business, or her previous work as a chaplain and a church youth leader. Guardian Australia has spoken to local Nationals members who said they only recently became aware of Hone’s conservative religious views and her past involvement with minor political parties in Queensland, including a period as a state office-bearer of the defunct Family First party. She has also previously supported the rightwing Australian Conservatives. Historical social media posts show Hone seeking to contact people who were “passionate about making an impact in government” and “taking the political mountain for Jesus”. A YouTube video of Hone speaking at the Living Waters Pentecostal church in the electorate last year shows her telling worshippers: “I’m so glad that you don’t trust your government any more”. “I’m so glad that you are worried about the vaccination, that you no longer trust medical science, because you are asking questions about what happens after death,” she said. “The public are asking these great questions. The harvest is ready. I’m having amazing conversations with people, even in the political arena, who have been working on government places for decades and all of a sudden they don’t like the government. They don’t know what they’re doing there. This is a great place. “How do we bring God’s kingdom to the political arena? How do we change the mountain, from the inside out, not the outside in. “The ultimate goal for me is … I want to bring God’s kingdom to the political arena. And I want God’s kingdom to penetrate the political mountain.” On Wednesday, Hone told Guardian Australia: “My motivation in running for parliament is to represent the best interests of the people of the Richmond electorate, and any suggestion otherwise is absurd. “There is nothing wrong with being a Christian and running for parliament. I stand by my faith and I ask that be respected, as I respect the beliefs of others.” Party members say they have written to federal leader Barnaby Joyce to complain that Hone’s anti-government comments reflect poorly on the Nationals, who have been part of the government for nine years. They also claim Hone’s views are “out of step” with most local branch members and the local community, and that they believe the candidate had not been upfront about her underlying motivations when seeking preselection. Richmond was once National and Country party heartland – an agricultural area represented by three generations of the Anthony family for more than 50 years. But the seat, which is centred on Tweed Heads, Byron Bay, Ballina and the hinterland, has become very socially progressive in recent decades. The outgoing NSW Liberal MP Catherine Cusack, who lives in the area, this week endorsed the Greens candidate for Richmond, Mandy Nolan. Cusack told the Guardian that Hone’s candidacy is indicative of the way elements of the Christian right had been able to gain a foothold in the National and Liberal parties in recent years. “These people are a wrecking ball through the Liberal and National parties,” Cusack said. “They destroy moderates who cross the floor, they destroy trans people, and they do it in the name of God. It’s so destructive. It’s not liberal values, but it’s also not Australian values. “This would be the last electorate where those sort of views would work.” The Labor MP Justine Elliot has condemned Hone’s posts as “repulsive” and “deeply offensive”. Elliot holds the seat by about 4% from the Nationals. But her strongest challenge at the upcoming election could come from Nolan, who is running for the Greens. Nolan said the region was inclusive and celebrated diversity. “The people of the northern rivers deserve someone who is guided by science and compassion.”",News/Australia news,NSW Nationals candidate tells congregation of her aim to ‘bring God’s kingdom’ to politics,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/21/nsw-nationals-candidate-tells-congregation-of-her-aim-to-bring-gods-kingdom-to-politics
4/21/2022,"Each time News Corp turns its sights on a new target, Twitter campaigners blame an unprecedented “Murdochracy” for the dire state of our political culture. Yet we need to remember that every significant social movement in Australian history has faced vocal – and sometimes overwhelming – opposition from the mainstream press. In 1856, when stonemasons working at the University of Melbourne marched through the city demanding the eight-hour day, the Melbourne Herald attacked them as “stupid mischievous blockhead[s]” engaging in “childish and useless perambulations”. During the campaign against the Vietnam war, the Daily Telegraph urged citizens to avoid the moratorium demonstration like “a plague spot”, warning that anyone who attended took “a share in the mob’s blind recklessness, and that is a needless moral burden which no sane man will care to shoulder”. After police attacked the first gay liberation Mardi Gras in 1978, the Sydney Morning Herald published the names of all those arrested, more or less guaranteeing their victimisation by employers and landlords. If you try to change society, you necessarily challenge those invested in the status quo. Almost by definition, you must take on the corporations that benefit from the world-as-it-is – a category that, since at least the last 150 years, has included the various media empires. That’s why, during most of the 20th century, newspapers, as a matter of course, urged their readers to vote conservative. “The Australian presses,” writes Nick Economou, “privately owned and, for a large part of their history, subject to the authoritarian style of individual proprietors who saw intervention as the right of proprietorship, had a long record of never endorsing the Australian Labor Party.” When the Melbourne Herald – the pre-eminent title in the Herald and Weekly Times stable – backed Bob Hawke in 1983, its decision broke a century-long run of anti-Labor editorials. Back then, newspaper endorsements mattered – or, at least, they mattered considerably more than they do now. Before the internet, Australians possessed few choices for news. If you lived in a metropolitan region, you opted between two or three daily papers and you tuned in to a handful of TV and radio stations. The jingle with which Melbourne’s Channel Nine promoted its newsreader Brian Naylor captures something of the power that journalists once possessed. “I know everything I need to know,” it ran, “because Brian told me so.” No contemporary outlet would dare make a similar claim to a monopoly on relevant information. How could they? Today, the internet’s become the main source of news for Australians – and the diversity on offer dramatically reduces the authority of any particular outlet. A recent survey found only 43% of Australians trusted the media, the only major institution distrusted by the majority of the population. The popular scepticism about the media pertains particularly to the outlets most associated with rightwing culture wars, with, for instance, another study in 2021 showing how few people trusted the Daily Telegraph. Yes, the rightwing media still wields power – but not nearly as much as it would like us to believe. Think of the coverage of Anthony Albanese’s “gaffes”. His campaign could only be derailed by gotcha questions because Labor’s “small target” strategy partly rested on placating News Corp so as to avoid even the hint of controversy. Hence Albanese’s willingness to endure the Daily Telegraph’s humiliating pop quizzes about his wokeness or lack thereof. By refusing to fight for an agenda of its own, Labor’s allowed the media to set the terms of debate. It didn’t have to be like that. When Adam Bandt snapped “google it, mate” at a reporter trying to catch him out on statistics, the answer resonated with a public disdainful of stunts and shenanigans. Likewise, when pundits attacked Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, he simply attacked them back, consciously cultivating hostility from a deeply unpopular media class on the basis it would boost his own stocks. In Victoria, Dan Andrews developed a different strategy with the lengthy press conferences he staged during the pandemic. The aggressive questioning Andrews received did not dent his standing; on the contrary, live footage of journalists questioning him won the premier considerable sympathy. Even in the past, the conservative media has often proved impotent against those prepared to take it on. In 1856, the stonemasons’ “useless perambulations” meant that Australian workers enjoyed the eight-hour day long before most comparable countries. The anti-war campaigners forced the government to withdraw from the cruel war in Vietnam; the gay rights movement grew and grew and grew, with the SMH eventually apologising for its coverage. Today, Jack Waterford correctly describes the Murdoch media as a “paper tiger”, noting that its titles failed, despite concerted campaigning, to swing the vote in recent elections in Queensland, Victoria and South Australia. He adds: “They often fail to set the agenda as well. It appeared, for example, that the moral panic about African gangs – supposed to have made every Melburnian afraid to go out at night – caused a backlash – making many voters disgusted at the thinly disguised racial basis of the campaign and swinging instead to Labor. At the height of the Dictator Dan disturbances, with the Herald Sun (and the Australian) virtually inciting an uprising against Melbourne’s lockdown, the popularity of the premier, Daniel Andrews, seemed to actually increase.” Mind you, paper tigers may as well be real if we cower under our beds in fear of them. Obviously, it’s a good thing that so many people feel passionate about improving the media. We can and should demand a different approach. At the same time, progressives can’t use the media as an alibi for our own failures. The best reporting in the world won’t change society for us. If we want to win, we have to actually fight.

4/21/2022,"Sangita Jogi’s illustration Women Partying, a joyful depiction of an all-girl disco nightclub, looks very much like something you might see in Teen Vogue. In reality, it’s on the wall at the National Gallery of Victoria, as part of a new exhibition highlighting new acquisitions from contemporary Indian artists in rural, regional, and Indigenous traditions, some handed down for centuries. What is unique about 19-year-old Sangita is that she works in a style practised only in her family: Jogi art, an energetic drawing style using in black ink on white paper, featuring detailed patterns and large, complex composition. It’s been practised for three generations of the Jogi family – which is to say, it’s startlingly modern. “What’s distinctive about this family, as opposed to others, is that they haven’t inherited this style,” says Wayne Crothers, senior curator of Asian art at the NGV. “It’s come out of them preserving their narrative traditions or their singing and performing traditions.” “I was inspired by the idea of women celebrating,” Sangita says of her work. “Women are so burdened, and women who are poor, even more so. So I just thought of making a work about the opposite scenario – of women enjoying themselves”. The Jogi artform started with Sangita’s parents, Ganesh and Teju. Their family name derives from their community, the Jogi, in rural Rajasthan. Untrained in visual art, the Jogi were traditionally roving musicians, singers of devotional songs and stories. Their music also had a practical function. “The Jogi were the alarm clocks of earlier times,” says Minhazz Majumdar, a New Delhi curator who worked with the NGV on the exhibition. “They’d sing songs at the crack of dawn … we always had a barter system going, somebody would pay them.” By the 1970s, urbanisation was making such a livelihood increasingly untenable. Then severe drought hit. Facing crop failure and famine, Teju and Ganesh were forced to move to the city of Ahmedabad, Gujarat, in search of work – often dangerous, low-paid manual labour. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning It was then that Ganesh met anthropologist Haku Shah, part of a wave of Indian scholars and curators seeking to preserve cultural traditions threatened by the pace of social change. Shah urged Ganesh to record the narratives in Jogi songs, to protect them from being lost to history. Ganesh could not write, so Shah suggested he draw the stories. “He was so scared he would break the pen at first,” says Majumdar – she’s worked with the family for over 20 years – “and now, the children do it in their own style.” Ganesh and Teju had 10 children, of whom six have survived; all of them paint and draw. “Drawing is like a meditation, like a healing space for me – I lose myself in my drawings, in creating all the details … they make me forget my struggles,” says Prakash, Sangita’s older brother. In his intricate work Cityscape (2017), Prakash depicts his home in Ahmedabad the way he saw it as a child; tall apartment blocks, puffing smoke towers, and masses of tiny human figures scurrying between them, uniformly intent on their business, ignoring the fish and turtles in the Sabarmati River that winds through the city. A close look reveals every figure is unique – they all have different socks, or hair, or eyes. Prakash is teaching his teenage son to draw in the Jogi style; nobody in the family sings any more, except Teju and Ganesh. But while the Jogi family’s pivot to a whole new medium is dramatic, all the art forms featured in the exhibition are undergoing rapid transformation. “A lot of these families, who have been practising these works for centuries and centuries, it’s been more within the domestic context,” says Sunita Lewis, project officer at the NGV. “But the last few decades, they’ve been changing the medium, or they’ve been changing the themes, in order to make them a commodity and reach a far wider audience than just their own communities.” “Commodity” is a word curators often shy away from, but these artists aren’t hobbyists or members of India’s urban middle class. Art is their livelihood: if their traditions are to survive and stay relevant, they need a market. Sujuni, a style of embroidered quilt, was traditionally a way for women to reuse scrap fabric for practical gifts; now, they’re made for display to sell on the international art market, providing village women with a livelihood. Contemporary sujuni work often features motifs of women’s independence like laptops and mopeds. Similarly, Madhubani art originated with murals painted in homes for significant events like marriage and childbirth; now, Madhubani artists are working on paper in order to sell or display their art internationally, tackling themes like climate change, female foeticide, and Covid-19. Artists are also increasingly signing their work – something that wasn’t always done in the past, or demanded by collectors. Most of the older works in the NGV exhibition are by unknown or unrecorded artists. “The fact that the market has woken up is making it easier now to promote these artists as artists, and not as nameless, faceless carriers of tradition,” Majumdar says. But, she concedes, increased interest from the art market doesn’t always translate into a secure future for artists. For the most part, the Jogi family are still pretty much where they were 20 years ago – except Sangita, who recently moved away from Ahmedabad. She lives in rural Rajasthan with her husband, and she’s just had her first child – a girl. Sangita has never been dancing in a nightclub. Women Partying, she says, was based on parties she’s seen in movies and TV, and her imagination. “My style is more fantasy-like, compared to my family,” Sangita says. “I draw what I would like to see – empowered women enjoying life.” And, she says, she’s teaching her daughter to draw.

4/21/2022,"The easing of Covid restrictions in Victoria and New South Wales has been welcomed by industry groups, despite concerns from some epidemiologists that it sends the wrong message at a time daily infections remain high. From Friday, people in both states who live with Covid-19 cases or are deemed close contacts will no longer have to quarantine for seven days, provided they have no symptoms. Instead, they will be required to undertake rapid antigen tests, wear masks while indoors, work from home where possible and avoid high-risk settings such as aged care and hospitals. In Victoria, patrons will no longer need to show proof of their vaccination status to enter hospitality or entertainment venues, and check-in QR codes will no longer be required anywhere. The state also dropped mask requirements in primary schools, early childhood centres, hospitality, retail and events, bringing it largely in line with NSW and Queensland. However, Victoria is keeping vaccination mandates for key workers at this stage, while in NSW it has been lifted for all but aged care and disability workers. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, welcomed the announcements, telling reporters in Adelaide: “They are getting back to normal. Hallelujah.” Industry groups also praised the Victoria and NSW governments, describing the scrapping of the seven-day isolation for household contacts as an enormous relief for businesses severely affected by staff shortages. “The removal of these isolation requirements in NSW and Victoria are an important step on the path towards living with Covid and are an example for the other jurisdictions to follow,” the Australian Retailers Association CEO, Paul Zahra, said in a statement. “We’re one of the most vaccinated countries in the world, and into the third year of this pandemic. The days of overzealous Covid rules are over.” The Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive, Paul Guerra, said the announcements put “Covid-19 in the rear-view mirror”. Tim Piper from the Australian Industry Group said it was “the next step in us moving closer to a more ‘Covid normal’ situation”. The views among epidemiologists, however, were mixed. Prof Mike Toole from the Burnet Institute said he was disappointed by the announcements, saying daily Covid cases were far too high to justify the changes. “I don’t think it’s been thought through particularly carefully. I don’t think there’s a clear strategy. I don’t know what our objectives are any more,” he told Guardian Australia. “The message that it sends on Friday is basically that it’s all over, the pandemic is in the past tense. And it’s clearly not. Anyone who looks at the numbers knows it’s not in the past.” Toole said Australia currently had one of the world’s highest rates of new cases a day, averaging dozens of deaths daily. “How can you say we’re entering a new phase of the pandemic when we reported 50,966 new cases [on Wednesday]?” he said. “People are still living in the belief that Australia somehow avoided the worst of the pandemic, they don’t seem to mind the fact that more than 4,000 people have died from Covid in less than four months this year. That’s twice as many as the combined number of deaths in 2020 and 2021.” Victoria recorded 14 deaths and 10,628 new infections on Wednesday, while NSW recorded 15 deaths and 15,414 cases. Authorities in both jurisdictions are confident they have passed the peak of the latest Omicron wave. University of Melbourne epidemiologist Prof Nancy Baxter said the further easing of restrictions would mean the country would not be able to reduce its daily case tally before heading into winter. “If we relax all restrictions, what we’re going to find is we have a plateau – a high number of cases on an ongoing basis – that leads to a lot of hospitalisation, significant amount of death and a lot of long Covid,” she told ABC News Breakfast. “That’s what we’re setting ourselves up for by basically wanting to act like it’s 2019.” Australian National University infectious disease expert Prof Peter Collignon, however, did not expect there to be a huge spike in cases because of the changes, citing high vaccination rates and a large proportion of the population having already had the virus. “The vast majority of the Australian population have had a booster already with either the vaccine or a natural infection, so I think from the point of view of hospitalisation and death, it won’t be as bad as I was expecting this winter,” he said. “Will we see cases? Yes, we will. I don’t think we’re going to see another huge peak, though.” Collignon said Australia has reached a new phase in the pandemic, thanks to vaccination uptake, the milder Omicron variant and the availability of new treatments. “Our outlook as far as death and serious disease is concerned is much, much better than it was a year-and-a-half ago, which allows us to change how we react to it,” he said. The head of the epidemiological modelling unit at Monash University, Dr James Trauer, agreed. “These sorts of changes are reasonable and I think the mix is right,” he said, adding that boosting third and fourth vaccine doses should be the primary focus of authorities going forward. “As restrictions come off, we need to have a positive, proactive response around vaccination to make sure we get high coverage, which I think should be done through a health promotion approach and moving away from vaccine mandates.” Trauer also urged governments to think about how they will manage the virus in the long-term. “We’ve got a federal election just around the corner, it’s just the right time to be talking about what sort of sustainable things we can do to invest in public health going forward,” Trauer said. “I was hoping that the pandemic would be a bit of a wake-up call that we really need to have a health system that’s focused on preventive care, that’s focused on marginalised and vulnerable groups and that doesn’t always run right at capacity, which is what we had before the pandemic.” The secretary of the Victorian Trades Hall Council, Luke Hilakari, urged workplaces to maintain Covid-safe plans to protect their workforce and encouraged any workers with symptoms to stay at home. “While we might have gone through the peak, we certainly don’t know what’s around the corner, and for some people Covid has had life changing, devastating effects.”",News/Australia news,Epidemiologists split over easing of Covid restrictions in NSW and Victoria,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/21/epidemiologists-split-over-easing-of-covid-restrictions-in-nsw-and-victoria
4/21/2022,"Almost all of Australia’s fuel supply is imported, leaving the country vulnerable to shortages, a thinktank has warned in a new report accusing the government of not doing enough to reduce and replace demand. As the war in Ukraine puts the global fuel supply in sharp focus, the Australia Institute found that 91% of Australia’s fuel in the 2021 financial year was imported (including 68% imported as refined crude, as well as 71% of the fuel refined here). According to the report, released on Thursday, Australia’s largest suppliers are Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea and China. While International Energy Agency (IEA) guidelines require Australia to hold 90 net import days’ worth of fuel, the report said the country only holds 68 IEA days of reserve – and based on average daily consumption over the past year, current stocks are only expected to last 32 days. Though the federal government has promised to meet IEA guidelines by 2026, the report revealed it plans to do this not by increasing reserves, but by including barrels of liquid fuel in transit or on ships docked in foreign ports. During a crisis, the Australia Institute suggested, supply issues could hold up Australia’s fuel elsewhere – as seen with delays to Covid-19 vaccine orders during the pandemic. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “There is no guarantee of these oil supplies reaching Australia within any particular time frame,” the report said. Part of the issue has been the decline in domestic production capacity. In a decade, Australia has gone from 20 operating oil refineries to two. According to the report, Ampol’s Lytton refinery and Viva’s Geelong refinery have capacity to produce less than a quarter of the volume of petroleum products consumed by the country in 2018-19. The report said not enough work had been done to reduce fuel demand. If every passenger vehicle in the nation’s current fleet was a pure electric vehicle, 33% of imported oil could be replaced with domestic electricity; and even if only a quarter were electric, the report said, 8% of total imports would not be needed. Just 0.8% of Australia’s new vehicle sales in 2020 were electric, compared to the global average of 4.2%. “Australia is an international laggard when it comes to fuel efficiency,” the Australia Institute’s climate and energy program director, Richie Merzian, said in a statement. “Weak fuel standards and an absence of a national electric vehicle policy leave Australia among the least fuel-efficient fleets in the OECD, and far behind the rest of the world in electric vehicle uptake.” Merzian warned that supply for transport fuels is a national security problem. “High petrol prices are already hurting Australians,” he said. “The only long-term solution is getting off oil. This involves increasing fuel efficiency and transitioning to electric vehicles.” The report called for the federal government to release the Liquid Fuel Security Review’s final report, provided to the government at the end of 2019, as well as publishing an electric vehicle strategy, a national energy security strategy, setting targets to ban internal combustion engine passenger vehicles by 2030 and targets for reduction of transport emissions by 2050. In March, a spokesperson for the energy minister, Angus Taylor, said there had been “significant changes to the fuel market both domestically and internationally since the interim liquid fuel security review was compiled”. They also said the government had taken proactive measures to enhance domestic fuel security, including subsidising both refineries until at least mid-2027 and increasing onshore diesel stocks by 40%.",News/Australia news,"Over 90% of Australia’s fuel imported leaving country vulnerable to shortages, report says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/21/over-90-of-australias-fuel-imported-leaving-country-vulnerable-to-shortages-report-says
4/21/2022,"The aged care sector has questioned the Coalition’s claims that the home care workforce has increased by almost 15% in a matter of months, saying the figures appear at odds with the “severe staffing challenges” it is experiencing. Aged care providers have repeatedly warned of the staffing crisis facing the sector, including in critically important home care services, where staffing issues have compromised the ability to provide some forms of support to older Australians in their own home. In response, the aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, said this week that the home care workforce had actually increased by 15,000, from 115,854 to 130,472, in the five months since November, which would represent a 13% increase to the total workforce. But the peak body for the aged care sector, Leading Age Services Australia, said it had seen no figures reflecting such a significant boost to the home care workforce. “We are not aware of any data that reflects this level of growth in the home care workforce,” its chief executive, Sean Rooney, told the Guardian. “We would be keen to find out more about the figures the minister has quoted and just where these workers are coming from. “Providers report to LASA that they continue to face severe staffing challenges due to the pandemic so it is difficult to see where these workers are coming from.” Asked for more detail about the figures, Colbeck’s office said they reflected data provided directly to the minister via the My Aged Care weekly reporting system. They reflected an increase in staff from “115,854 from 3 November 2021 to 130,472 to 13 April, 2022”, the spokesperson said. “This figure takes into account workforce fluctuations,” the spokesperson said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The latest publicly available, official dataset on the home care workforce is the Australian Bureau of Statistics aged care workforce census, conducted in late 2020. It found the total workforce in the Home Care Packages Program (HCPP), designed for more complex care needs, was 80,340. For the Commonwealth Home Support Programme (CHSP), which funds less complex care, the total workforce was 76,096. The combined workforce across both was 156,436, including 123,048 direct care staff. Colbeck’s office said the figure he was using related to HCPP only. The census said that 57% of CHSP providers reported a decrease in volunteer levels and 28% reported a decrease in personal care workers due to the pandemic. The majority of HCPP providers reported no change in staffing levels due to Covid, while 21% reported a decrease, and 18% reported an increase. The issue of aged care staffing is shaping as a significant issue for both parties in the next weeks of the campaign.

The Coalition promised 80,000 new home care packages and $338.5m to expand, train and upskill the aged care workforce in the last budget. Labor has promised nurses in every residential care facility 24/7, significant funding to improve nutrition for aged care residents, and improved transparency and accountability for providers. “Aged care workers are despairing,” Anthony Albanese said on Wednesday. “This is tough work. It’s physically demanding. They [are] faced with circumstances whereby they’re in an aged care home and they have three buzzers going at once. Which person do they go to?” Both major parties have made promises to fund pay rises for the sector and the Coalition has accused Labor of announcing nothing for home care specifically. Aged and Community Services Australia, an industry peak group, says the sector is suffering “a serious workforce shortage”. “Attracting home care and other aged care workers has become even more difficult through the pressures of the past two years,” Acsa’s chief executive, Paul Sadler, told the Guardian this week.

4/21/2022,"The Morrison government’s promise to spend $7.4bn building a series of new dams is probably “the biggest pork barrel in history,” says the author of new research that claims other investment would deliver significantly better economic outcomes and more jobs. The report by the Australia Institute said the vast majority of new spending on water infrastructure had been “allocated to where the National party vote is highest, not where the agricultural potential is highest”. It compared the economic impact of spending $5.4bn Hells Gates dam – a project where funding was committed before a business case was finalised – with the benefits of investing the same amount in aged care. Investment in aged care would create 48,000 jobs, compared to about 28,000 from the dam, the report found. “Pouring concrete creates jobs,” said chief economist at the Australia Institute and the report’s co-author, Dr Richard Denniss. “But it only helps the economy if it’s in the right shape and in the right place. You could build carparks in the desert and create jobs, but they just won’t be of any use.” The research questioned why – if the dam investment was designed to benefit the agricultural sector – most of the $7.4bn water infrastructure spending was allocated to projects in north Queensland, which contributes about 3% of the nation’s food production. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The vast majority of Australian agriculture takes place outside of Queensland and, in turn, the vast majority of Australian agriculture will receive little or no benefit from what is one the largest investments in Australian water infrastructure, all without a business case, and announced on the eve of an election campaign,” the report said. “This level of spending is nationally significant, but the main beneficiaries appear to be the National party in very specific locations. Despite the water and economic policy challenges nationally, there is no investment in this announcement for South Australia, Victoria, or Tasmania.” Denniss said the scale of the $7.4bn allocated to dam construction dwarfed other programs – like the “sports rorts” grants or funding for commuter carparks – for which the Morrison government has previously been accused of pork barrelling. “Is this the biggest pork barrel in history? I can’t think of a bigger one,” he said. Deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, has been contacted for comment. The report said dams had become a symbol of the National party’s ability to extract a “good deal” for regional voters from their Coalition partners, the Liberals. “As a result of the symbiotic importance that dam building has taken on within the Coalition, decision making about the size and location of dams appears to have been separated from the collection of evidence to support such dams, to the detriment of other water projects, other infrastructure more generally, and other states and regions that are not represented. “While there is nothing illegal about building dams, car parks, or other projects in regions based seemingly on political calculations rather than economic ones, there’s also no reason to expect they will deliver any lasting economic benefits beyond those paid to pour the concrete.”",News/Australia news,Morrison government’s $7.4bn in dam commitments could be ‘biggest pork barrel in history’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/21/morrison-governments-74bn-in-dam-commitments-could-be-biggest-pork-barrel-in-history
4/21/2022,"Australia’s coal export boom will come to an abrupt end because of an “imminent and substantial” drop in purchases by China, and local coal mining communities should brace for the change, the lead author of a new study says. The peer-reviewed paper, published on Thursday in the journal Joule, forecasts China’s thermal coal imports will contract at least a quarter from 2019 levels of 210m tonnes by 2025, mostly as improved transport links will give local suppliers an edge. If China pursues more ambitious efforts to cut carbon emissions, the decline will be almost twice as fast, with imports sinking to 115m tonnes by 2025. Shipments of coking coal used in steelmaking face a similar downward trajectory, the researchers found. The study used satellite and other data sources to compile a more detailed picture of individual power and steel plant coal demand. It also analysed how new transport links have expanded supplies from inland Chinese provinces and Mongolia to coastal users, supplanting Australian and Indonesian exporters. “This was actually somewhat of a surprising outcome for us,” said Jorrit Gosens, a researcher at the Australian National University’s Crawford School of Public Policy and the report’s lead author. “China reducing imports of thermal coal and coking coal by roughly a quarter over the next five years, that’s a major drop and not something that is far off into the future.” Gosens said that while both the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, were telling voters Australia’s coal exports had decades to run, the study indicated the future was likely to be a lot less promising. “We do hope with this [study] that folks in coal mining regions, industries and governments also look at those results and figure out that they need to be a little bit more hasty with their plans to reduce their dependency on the coal mining industry,” he said. China banned imports of coal and some other commodities from Australia in 2020 as ties between Beijing and Canberra frayed. Even without access to the Chinese market, lower orders from China would dent global demand – hurting Australian exporters – as the nation is by far the world’s biggest consumer of the fuel. China’s coal consumption had been flat for the past five to eight years, and would likely start falling in the next two to three years, Gosens said. Big investments in new infrastructure, such as the 1800km Haoji railway from China’s Inner Mongolia which opened last year, would trim reliance on imports. Transport alone can account for half of the cost of the bulky fossil fuel. While not necessarily providing good financial returns in their own right, such projects also helped to cut “dependency on volatile and politically unfriendly” sources of energy, Gosens said. Assuming Australian shipments were permitted to resume, the study’s modelling predicts Australian thermal coal exports would sink to 30-40 m tonnes in 2025, from about 50Mt in 2019. For coking or metallurgical coals, exports from Australia would drop from about 30Mt in 2019 to 20-22Mt by 2025. Co-author and ANU professor Frank Jotzo said: “Governments and investors would be wise to consider these findings in their medium- to long-term outlook, more than the short-term gains from the current energy market volatility.” Coal exports from Newcastle reached record levels of more than $US400 ($540) a tonne earlier this year, and have lately dropped to below $US300. “Coal will be on the way down,” Jotzo said. “We need to foster alternative economic futures.” While not a target of this study, India – another great hope for Australian coal exporters – was following a similar strategy to China. It too would aim to reduce coal demand for emissions reasons but favour local producers as it did so, even if domestic supplies were of a lower quality in terms of ash or calorific content. Australia’s other major Asian markets for its coal – South Korea, Japan and Taiwan – all had plans for net-zero emissions by 2050 and would be cutting their imports “quite rapidly over the next decade”, Gosens said. Russia, meanwhile, would divert some of the coal it can no longer sell to Europe eastwards. High transport costs and limited free capacity, though, would likely see only marginal effects on Asian coal markets, he said.",News/Australia news,Australia’s coal export boom forecast to end abruptly amid big drop in demand from China,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/21/australias-coal-export-boom-forecast-to-end-abruptly-amid-big-drop-in-demand-from-china
4/21/2022,"Living in regional Queensland, David Conway sometimes waits up to three hours for a taxi to arrive. He says there are so few wheelchair-accessible taxis in Mackay that no matter how far he plans ahead, he can never rely on them to arrive on time – or at all. This week, Conway missed an urgent medical appointment after waiting almost an hour for a taxi to arrive, before finally cancelling the trip. “I have endocrine issues and I need to do a blood test within the next two weeks so my specialist can make sure my medication is right,” Conway says. “But it feels like people in wheelchairs are an afterthought. We’re not a priority.” Conway is vision impaired and paraplegic. He says drivers operating taxis don’t always have the appropriate training, putting passengers with disabilities at risk. “I’ve had one driver not strap me in properly … and slam on the brakes to avoid collision,” he says. “I fell out of my chair, smashed my head and was bleeding through my nose and face. My GP said it was a miracle that … I didn’t break my jaw, nose or cheekbones, with the extreme bruising that I had.” But Conway says catching public transport can also be a gruelling experience. Not only are buses infrequent in his area but – unlike wheelchair-accessible taxis – they have no safety straps to keep passengers secure. This means passengers rely solely on the brakes of their wheelchair and upper body strength to stay still. “You want to hope the driver takes it easy on corners but that doesn’t always happen. If they go around like Fast and Furious, I might slide forward as well,” he says. Chair of the Queenslanders with Disability Network (QDN), Des Ryan, says it’s common for people with disabilities to wait one to three hours for an accessible taxi to show up – particularly in regional areas. “Sometimes there are just no accessible taxis working or available due to low numbers,” Ryan tells Guardian Australia. “QDN members have reported that in regional areas the situation is worse, with not enough accessible taxis to service the needs of the local population with disability – especially in growth areas like Cairns, Townsville, Rockhampton and Mackay.” Ryan says many people with disabilities don’t live close to public transport, meaning getting to the station or bus can be an extra challenge. “I don’t think people could imagine the amount of planning that people with disability have to do to get to doctor’s appointments, get our groceries, or get to work,” he says. “It’s difficult when you have to depend on others when striving for independence.” While the situation might be tougher for people with disabilities in regional areas, citysiders aren’t immune to these issues. Elisha Matthews lives in Hamilton, in north-east Brisbane, and says it’s nearly impossible to book an accessible taxi between 3pm and 5pm. She says this is because most wheelchair-accessible taxis are contracted to do school runs for children with disabilities. “I have full-time care of my seven-year-old granddaughter, and TransLink recently removed the bus route that went from my home to her school,” Matthews says. “Because [most taxis] are not available at 3pm, it’s a very difficult task. “I’ve had to make a permanent booking with the after-school care service, just in case I cannot pick her up on time.” Matthews lives with a neurological condition and autoimmune disease, which affects her mobility and causes her pain and fatigue. She says she waits an average of 30 minutes for taxis to accept her booking, and they often take another half an hour to arrive. The longest she’s waited for a taxi to arrive has been two and a half hours. “I really feel like I’m a burden to not only the taxi service, but the community,” Matthews says. “They seem to think we can just wait. But I’ve still got children to pick up from school and feed – I’ve still got a job to go to.” Matthews says she’s also experienced inappropriate behaviour from taxi drivers, including ableist comments and drivers turning on the meter before she gets inside the vehicle.

I decided after that it was safer for me to not argue,” Matthews says. “We’re very vulnerable, and drivers identify that and think they can get away with it.” The state’s Department of Transport and Main Roads (TMR) said the government launched a wheelchair-accessible taxi scheme in 2019 by funding half the cost of a vehicle. “TMR does not regulate wait times for taxis in Queensland, which are a commercial responsibility for taxi operators to manage in meeting their customers’ needs,” a spokesperson for the department said. “The driver of a taxi available for hire must not refuse to provide a taxi service to any person, or a booked hire service to a person in a wheelchair or to a member of the taxi subsidy scheme, unless they have a reasonable excuse.” Ryan says while the Queensland government has “done a lot to rectify the situation”, there’s still progress to be made. He says this includes working with the taxi industry to review accessibility against demand. “Being able to travel freely and grab a taxi is something that most Australians take for granted but that is not the experience for many people with disability,” Ryan says. “We need to continue to work on this and improve access for all.”",News/Australia news,‘We’re not a priority’: People with disabilities wait up to three hours for transport in regional Queensland,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/21/were-not-a-priority-people-with-disabilities-wait-up-to-three-hours-for-transport-in-regional-queensland
4/21/2022,"The Australian War Memorial is pursuing a new sponsorship deal from arms manufacturer Lockheed Martin despite being inundated with letters from veterans, historians and retired staff saying such arrangements are “degrading to the memory of our war dead”. More than 300 Australians wrote to the memorial urging it not to renew its deal with Lockheed Martin, due to the company’s involvement in nuclear weapons and surging share price following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The deal expired earlier this month. Those who have complained have claimed companies that profit from conflict should have “no place” in what should be a solemn memorial to the nation’s war dead. The AWM confirmed to the Guardian that the current sponsorship deal, which funded a podcast on veterans’ experiences, had concluded. But director Matt Anderson said the memorial was currently engaged in “ongoing discussions with Lockheed Martin Australia about future opportunities”. “The Memorial will continue to discuss options for further support,” Anderson said. The position has infuriated critics, who say the memorial has ignored the pleas of hundreds of Australians who voiced their opposition through a campaign organised by the Medical Association for Prevention of War (MAPW). More than 300 people wrote to the AWM director and council, citing Lockheed’s involvement in the production of nuclear weapons, and its sale of arms to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, among other things. Many of the letter-writers were veterans, or families of veterans, and added their own messages of personal opposition. Dr Sue Wareham, the association’s president, said the memorial responded to the letters with a standardised reply, which avoided the key issues of Lockheed Martin’s controversial history and its business model, which is based on an “absolute need for wars and instability in order to survive”. “The AWM has virtually ignored every argument and personal plea that hundreds of Australians have raised with them against their policy of accepting weapons company funding,” she said. In response to the association’s criticism, the AWM said: “The Australian War Memorial values the support of corporate partners. The additional funding received through corporate sponsorship and donations has assisted the Memorial to develop exhibitions and programs that could not otherwise have been delivered without third party funding support.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Polling commissioned by MAPW and conducted by Ipsos suggested opposition to such deals was widely held. The polling asked respondents whether they agreed with the statement that “the war memorial should not accept money from companies that profit from the sale of weapons”. More than half (59%) of the nationally representative sample either agreed or strongly agreed.

The AWM has also accepted funding from other arms manufacturers, including Boeing, Thales and BAE.

4/21/2022,"There is nothing I love more than a good scroll. It’s something I leave until late at night, when my brain is at its lowest operational capacity and only has stamina to stomach little TikToks with one eye open as my mind begs me to turn your phone off, Chris, for the love of God, can’t you see how much you want to sleep right now, the internet will be here tomorrow please let me rest. As the day’s hours slip away, so too does my ability to absorb more substantial content. I’ll start my day trying to read something, then maybe watch a TV series – but by 2pm it is YouTube only, and after my big carb-loaded dinner, I’m riding Instagram and TikTok till I pass out. So with that, here are the best things I’ve seen on the internet so far. 1. Parks and Recreation: the ice rink scene When I watched this episode of Parks and Rec on my phone at an airport, I howled with laughter so loudly that people moved seats to get further away from me. One of the biggest airport laughs of my life. 2. TikTok: “Ahhh” girl This article includes content provided by TikTok.

Guy Montgomery on the news Guy Montgomery is a dear friend who I’ve been living with for an entire month during the Melbourne international comedy festival. Every night before I sleep, he comes into my room and performs this entire routine to me before I sleep and it never ceases to make me laugh. 6.
