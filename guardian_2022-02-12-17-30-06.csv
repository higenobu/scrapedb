2/12/2022,"Will Coombs (not his real name) has to test the blood of his 10-year-old son, Jamie, every two hours, even at night. Jamie has brittle diabetes, a rare form of type 1 diabetes that causes severe swings in his blood sugar levels. Before the pandemic he was hospitalised after catching a cold; on another occasion, with a stomach bug. The family decided to home school their three children to keep Jamie safe from Covid. His hospital consultant supports the family’s decision. But the government is threatening them with fines or prosecution if the children do not return to class.  His parents are used to being cautious when even trivial viruses are circulating at school, because they can cause Jamie’s blood sugar to fluctuate dangerously. People with diabetes have been disproportionately affected by Covid, and are much more likely to develop serious complications. “Education is important but health should be the priority,” says Coombs. “You cannot learn if you are seriously ill or worse as a result of catching Covid.” He believes the Department for Education’s stance on attendance at all costs is discriminatory. The latest DfE data estimates 320,000 pupils were absent for Covid-related reasons in England on 3 February. With many of his children’s school friends on their second or third Covid infection and masks no longer compulsory, Coombs is adamant that he is right to teach his three children at home. The authorities disagree. Jamie’s consultant wrote recently to his brother’s secondary school urging it to be “as supportive as possible” of the family’s decision to home school until all three children had been vaccinated and case rates were lower. But now, after advice from the DfE, the local authority has instructed the school not to send any work home to the family, and threatened them with fines or prosecution. The primary school that Jamie and his sister attend has made the same threats. Coombs doesn’t blame the headteachers, or even the council. He blames the government. He says the secondary school head “understands where we are coming from” but is under pressure to lean on families like his. He says the head has been told by the DfE that shielding has finished and all pupils must now be back in school. Coombs, who trained as a teacher, says: “Heads and teachers know the families and understand the issues and individual circumstances. Why can’t they be trusted to make a sensible decision on each case?” The government is consulting on more prescriptive plans to boost attendance and end what it calls a postcode lottery of how schools manage absences. These sorts of Covid cases are a grey area for schools. The education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, has confirmed in a letter to the Good Law Project that heads can exercise discretion over individual cases, but in practice schools say the very clear directive from the DfE is that all children must return to the classroom and they feel under pressure to deliver that. Parents who are home schooling because of Covid say schools are not giving them any work in case they are seen to support unauthorised absences. In January the Centre for Social Justice, a rightwing thinktank, raised fears about so-called “ghost children”, with a report claiming that severe absence “has spread across our school system like wildfire”. It said that in autumn 2020 more than 700 state schools were missing an entire class-worth of children. Dame Rachel de Souza, the children’s commissioner in England, has vowed to track down missing children. But families like the Coombses say theirs is a different story that needs to be heard. Their children are not vanishing, they are merely being protected by their families because they do not think there are enough mitigations in school to keep them safe. Many say, paradoxically, that the pressure from the DfE is forcing them to consider opting out of the system permanently. April Booth, a co-founder of a parent campaign group, Safe Ed For All, will appear in court on 25 February for refusing to send her son, Casper, back to his secondary school in Portsmouth while cases remain high. She risks a fine of up to £2,500, which she cannot afford, or three months in prison. She says: “I’m not an activist and I have been scared at times. I know so many people who have deregistered [their children from school] rather than face court, but my son wants to go back to school when things improve. The government is criminalising parents for trying to protect their children during a health crisis.” Booth took Casper out of school in 2020 when his grandfather was hospitalised with Covid for four months and nearly died. Casper, now in year 8, hasn’t returned since. She describes the lack of mitigations to protect children and their vulnerable family members as “mind-boggling”. “I’ll be happy to return him to school when community transmission is a lot lower, when far more children are wearing masks and ventilation has been looked at properly,” she says. Casper’s school says attendance is mandatory and “the vast majority of parents have confidence” in what it is doing. A spokesperson said: “Missing school means students fall behind, which has serious consequences for their progression.” Kim Wareham, from Bath, reluctantly deregistered her 10-year-old daughter, who has a learning disability and a rare genetic syndrome, from her special needs school last week after keeping her at home since numbers rose with Omicron. Wareham says she deregistered because, without remote work being sent home for her daughter, she felt she had been shut out of the system. “We were learning about electricity and my daughter made a torch out of a cardboard tube and wired up the circuits. She was so proud of it and we sent a photo, but so far we’ve heard nothing back. That’s sad.” “Having my daughter around all the time is wonderful,” she says. “But it is so important she mixes with peers who face similar life and learning issues. It feels really unfair that we’ve had to remove her.” The head of a primary school in Kent, who asked not to be named, said: “We use a range of strategies to try to encourage parents to bring children in. The risk is that if you push them too hard they self-select to home educate and are never seen again in the education system.” Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, says cracking down on attendance will be a key part of the forthcoming schools white paper. “I’ve been saying you must be so careful not to demonise parents and make them feel they are the problem,” he says. Gemma Moss, of University College London’s Institute of Education, led a research project looking at how schools have interacted with families during the pandemic. “The problem is the government isn’t trusting teachers and is ignoring the personal relationships they have with families. You can’t map all of this from the centre,” she says. “We looked at primary schools and they are deeply embedded in their communities. Headteachers would go and knock on doors if they hadn’t heard from a family and were worried about a child.” Hannah Wilson (not her real name), from East Anglia, took her children, aged eight and 11, out of primary school because they were uneasy about the lack of Covid safety measures. Wilson and her husband had long Covid, including migraines, stomach cramps, tinnitus, leg pains and fatigue, for more than a year, and her son suffered for nine months. They don’t want the virus again. “I think the head is very sympathetic and is clearly in a difficult position,” she says. “We don’t get supported with any work. There are no concerns about their education at home, but there is pressure on the head for us to return.” She adds: “I have thought about exiting the system because of the pressure. If they were to fine me I would be very tempted to see them in court as I feel the way the government is behaving is unacceptable.” A spokesperson for the DfE said: “As we learn to live with Covid, thanks to the success of the vaccination programme, there is no longer advice for vulnerable people to shield and it is right that children attend school full-time. “The protective measures in place in schools follow scientific advice on how to strike the balance between protecting education and reducing transmission – including with enhanced ventilation and air cleaning units for classrooms that need them, and a vaccination offer for every child aged five and over with underlying health conditions.”",News/Education,"DfE is ‘criminalising parents’ in England, say families still shielding from Covid ",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/12/dfe-is-criminalising-parents-in-england-say-families-still-shielding-from-covid
2/12/2022,"The cost of living crisis is poised to deepen in April, when national insurance contributions will rise by 1.25 percentage points, just as inflation, energy and water bills soar. There may not be a way to reduce your outgoings but it is possible to boost what you have coming into your account or to make your earnings go further.  From 6 April 2022, the planned rise in national insurance contributions means a worker earning £30,000 a year will see their take-home pay fall by £17 a month, or £214 a year, while someone earning £50,000 will lose £38 a month, or £456 a year. However, you may be able to avoid some of this increase in your bill by paying for some things before you are taxed. Your employer may allow you to donate to charity (for example, via the Charities Aid Foundation’s Give as You Earn programme), buy a bike or purchase an ultra-low emission car via a salary sacrifice scheme. These payments are taken off your gross income. The lower your gross income, the less you must pay in income tax and national insurance contributions. “A lot of employees aren’t aware of the savings they can make by opting in to salary sacrifice,” says Dan Tomassen, a spokesperson for the accountancy firm HW Fisher. This is particularly true of employees who have been auto-enrolled into a pension scheme, he says. “A lot of the time, the pension deductions that the employee has to contribute are taken from their net salary – so after tax has been deducted.” If your employer will allow you to make these contributions from your gross salary instead, via salary sacrifice, it will reduce the amount of national insurance you have to pay. Employees used to be able to pay for childcare through salary sacrifice but that scheme has been replaced and is only available to those who signed up before October 2018. Another option, if your employer offers a share incentive plan, is to buy “partnership shares” in the company you work for out of your pre-tax salary. This will cut the amount of national insurance you have to pay this year and – if you keep the shares for at least five years – you will never pay any income tax on their value. However, you may be liable for capital gains tax if the shares increase in value. Another way to offset the national insurance increase is to take advantage of tax allowances you are entitled to claim. For example, if you have been told to work from home – no matter how often – you are entitled to help from HMRC with expenses such as energy, internet costs and business calls. Your employer can pay you a fixed amount of up to £6 a week, tax free, to cover these costs or you can claim tax relief on £6 a week from the government instead. “Your claim can be backdated for the last tax year as well, and even if you only worked at home for one day in the tax year, you can claim for the entire year,” says Paul Gibbons, a payroll specialist at PayDashboard. Bear in mind you will get relief at the rate at which you pay tax – so a basic-rate taxpayer will get £1.20 a week in tax relief (20% of £6), while a higher-rate taxpayer will get £2.40 a week. This means basic-rate taxpayers who work from home can claw back £62.40 a year in tax, while higher rate taxpayers are entitled to £124.80. Another tax relief you may be able to claim is the marriage allowance, which applies not only to marriages but also to civil partnerships. About 2.4 million eligible couples are estimated to be missing out on this tax relief, worth up to £252 a year. “A lot of people don’t actually know this allowance exists,” Gibbons says. To claim, one member of the couple must earn less than £12,500 and their spouse or civil partner must be a basic-rate taxpayer. “Cohabitation is not sufficient,” says Emma Rawson, a technical officer at the Association of Taxation Technicians. You can backdate your claim to any tax year since 5 April 2017 that you were eligible, and if your spouse or civil partner has died since then, you can still claim by calling HMRC. If you are required to wear a specific uniform at work, you may be able to claim tax relief on the cost of buying, cleaning, repairing or replacing it. This is “one of the most underused deductions that is available to a lot of people”, Tomassen says. To qualify for the relief, you must be required to wear “clothing of a specialised nature that is recognisable as a uniform”, which demonstrates to a member of the public that you have a particular occupation. If your employer simply asks you to turn up to work wearing a shirt in a certain colour, you won’t qualify. You can claim the relief on the cost of repairing or replacing “small tools” such as drill bits or scissors you need to do your job, along with specialist boots or particular shoes you need to wear as part of your uniform. It is worth noting that a deduction is not permitted for personal protective equipment. The standard sum you can claim tax relief on is £60 a year, so basic-rate taxpayers who claim this relief will be £12 better off, while higher-rate taxpayers will get £24. Some industries qualify for larger allowances. An NHS ambulance worker who launders their uniform at home, for example, can claim tax relief on £185 of uniform expenses each year, meaning they will take home an extra £74 a year if they are a higher-rate taxpayer. It takes only 10 minutes, on average, to check whether there are state benefits you may be entitled to claim via the free benefits calculator on entitledto.co.uk. “We think that around £15bn of benefits are unclaimed across the population,” said Dr Phil Agulnik, an entitledto director. The main problem, he says, is that people assume their income is too high to qualify for any benefits, “so they don’t bother checking”. In fact, means-tested benefits are awarded by assessing your income and your needs. “The more needs you’ve got, the more likely you are to qualify because you need more help,” Agulnik says. Pensioners with large council tax bills and people who are in work but on a low income are often entitled to claim more benefits than they realise, he says. You may be eligible for universal credit, for example, even if you have a job. This benefit acts like a passport, enabling you to then claim other benefits and tax credits, such as housing benefit and child tax credit. Recipients of universal credit may also be entitled to help with health costs, housing grants, free school meals, energy efficient grants and the warm home discount. So even if you discover you are only eligible to receive a few pennies of universal credit each week, it is worth claiming this benefit to gain access to other help you may be entitled to. “Check it for yourself,” Agulnik urges. “Go through the calculator – £15bn is a lot of money.” Entitledto’s estimates of unclaimed benefits are based on what it describes as “sketchy statistics” because published government data is not good – and it is about to get worse. The Department for Work and Pensions recently put out a notice saying that it would no longer be publishing takeup rates for a number of benefits paid to working-age adults. Of the benefits included in the figures, the two largest relate to housing – an estimated 900,000 families have been missing out on housing benefit worth a total of £2.8bn. Council tax support – a reduction of up to 100% of your bill – was going unclaimed by 2.8 million families (although the figures were last updated more than a decade ago). That help was worth a combined £2.6bn. Hundreds of thousands of households were also missing out on child tax credit or working tax credit, with about £2.5bn of each going unclaimed.Hilary Osborne",Lifestyle/Money,Cost of living crisis: the squeeze is on – here’s what you can do,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/12/cost-of-living-crisis-the-squeeze-is-on-heres-what-you-can-do
2/12/2022,"There’s not much that I miss about my youth, but if I could permanently restore my lost smattering of nose freckles, I would. Few things are as attractive as a constellation of pigment clusters imprinted across the face, and the more densely they’re packed, the less makeup you’ll need to wear (a girlfriend of mine is covered completely in freckles and it’s as though she wakes up each morning in a perfect face of foundation).  That said, women with freckles will simultaneously have other skin concerns and may crave coverage, but I’d urge them not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. A thick foundation will send freckles grey and dull. Better to unify the surrounding skin tone with a clean, more transparent base like Chanel’s Les Beiges Water Fresh Tint (£50) or, for a little more coverage, MAC Cosmetics Face & Body Foundation (£32 for a bottle four times the size of most). Then use a full coverage concealer to camouflage any spots or dark circles. Those bereft of their former freckles, or those who’ve never known the joy at all, can fake them if they’ve the inclination. There are now several faux freckle pens on the market, Freck (£17) being the original and most famous, but for something so novelty, I’d suggest Lottie London Freckle Tint, for a less risky £6.95. Whichever you choose, the most natural application method is to get as many freckles from each brush-to-pot dip as possible – this mimics the naturally varied shade density of real melanin dots – some lighter or smaller, some darker or bigger. When the dotted-on freckles are semi-dry, tap your finger on to them, and then again on to the unmarked surrounding skin, effectively copy and pasting your freckles across the nose and cheeks. This haphazard, blurry approach gives an authentically scattered freckle pattern, as opposed to the uniformly dotted brow pencil method that unfailingly looks too St Trinian’s fancy dress. It’s a fun, pretty look to try once in a while, though its wash-off nature makes it a faff for anything approaching daily wear. That said, do not make like a TikToker and use longer lasting henna, unless you’ve got your technique down and are absolutely sure it’s natural henna sold specifically for skin, not hair. Never, ever use “black henna” (PPD dye that can trigger a reaction and kickstart lifelong allergies), and remember any errors will take days to fade.",Lifestyle/Fashion,How to make the most of your freckles – or fake them | Sali Hughes,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/feb/12/how-to-make-the-most-of-your-freckles-or-fake-them
2/12/2022,"It is the system of law – used in the UK as well as in many places that used to be part of the British empire – based on precedents from judge’s decisions rather than in statutory law.  Common law is made by judges who study reports of older cases which have been decided and then derive principles from them that will be applied by other judges in future. They vary, but activists and others believe they can draw on Magna Carta and ancient English law to challenge or ignore regulations and even bring politicians, scientists and journalists before supposed common law courts for “crimes”. Such courts have not legal existence, nor do bogus writs, which anti-vaccine activists have been “serving” at schools and hospitals, calling for the administration and promotion of Covid-19 vaccines to be halted. Common law writs or common law courts do not exist, nor do “common law constables”, which some activists have been “training” in order to form physical barriers against what they wrongly believe are the “unlawful” actions of the police and other legitimate authorities. The modern bogus “common law” movement had roots in US sovereign citizen movements, emerging in the 1970s and gaining prominence as it merged with the growth of rightwing militias. It made its way, via Canada, to the UK, where proponents have ranged from fringe political activists who have attempted to promote it by standing for office through to others attempting to set up “shadow” police forces. Others included pro-Trump supporters who attempted to stage a citizen’s arrest of Sadiq Khan in 2018. Proponents of the bogus common law became more bellicose in the run-up to Brexit. However, the belief has been turbocharged on social media and has found a bigger and more receptive audience among those seeking reasons to disobey or ignore lockdown regulations during the pandemic. A plethora of new, anti-lockdown and anti-vaccine groups are promoting it, including in some cases running bogus “courses” alongside training in civil disobedience techniques. Some have attempted to disrupt vaccination centres by claiming that police are carrying out criminal investigations into the work after activists entered stations and made allegations. Police stress that reference numbers provided on these occasions to activists, who post footage on social media, do not mean there are investigations.",News/Law,What is common law and why is it being misinterpreted?,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/feb/12/what-is-common-law-and-why-is-it-being-misinterpreted
2/12/2022,"Iwas young the first time I watched porn. I didn’t have hips or enjoy eating olives. My parents still paid my phone bill and I’d never kissed anyone, despite the story I used to tell about some guy I met on my family holiday to Spain. I was on the school playing fields at lunchtime and a boy from my form came over and put his Sony Ericsson slider phone right in my face. On the screen I could see a blurred video of a woman in red suspenders pleasuring herself, letting tense breaths hiss out from behind her teeth. The space between her legs was smooth and hairless, like the skin of an unripe nectarine. She looked like I did, except I was 13 and she must have been older. “I bet you do this, don’t you?” the boy said, his eyes hidden beneath floppy hair. At the time I didn’t think much about the video, except it was a bit gross that she was doing that alone. There was no way I would have believed it affected me or that seeing more images like that eventually would. But porn was already shaping how I, and the men I would later share relationships with, viewed my body. It was implementing a code of behaviour we would draw and learn from. It was telling us what sex was when the only way we were educated about it in school was via condoms on bananas and photos of untreated gonorrhoea.  Back in the mid 00s, gaining access to porn was still quite difficult for teenagers. Not many of us had phones that could connect to the internet, so watching it meant waiting until your parents were out or asleep, when you could sit in front of the desktop computer. I still managed it. I needed to, because everyone who should have been telling me about sex was too embarrassed to. And I wasn’t going to learn on the job: I’d overheard too many horror stories about toothy blowjobs. I wanted to learn to be like those malleable, impressive bodies. I remember being stressed about what happened between missionary, eagle and doggy because so many videos cut out when people changed positions. I wanted to watch those hidden gaps. Was it clumsy and awkward, like getting out of a car in a short dress? Do you say with your voice where you want the other person to go? Or should the voice only be used to say things such as “Don’t stop!” and “Harder!”? Many say the best people to have sex with are those with a sense of humour, who smile when you fanny fart or nearly fall off the bed. Except I didn’t see any of that when I watched porn. It looked seamless, like a choreographed dance. The only clumsy part was the bad acting at the beginning when the masseur would ask his client to lie down on the table. While the men I saw on screen did lots of different things to the women they slept with – slapping, choking, pulling, gagging – it always had the same effect. She would arch her back and moan louder. We didn’t read this as unrealistic or uninspiring because it fitted in with the world we were already learning to live with. We laughed at the guys in school, even when their jokes weren’t funny; spent our lunch breaks watching them play football, knowing that if we attempted to join in it would look as if we were trying too hard. People act as if porn has created a world in which women’s desires are placed in service of men’s, when really it is an expression of that world. When it came to having sex, my friends and I knew to pretend to like it when guys started using that aggressive gun finger motion between our legs or mistook a thigh crease for a clitoris. That seemed to be women’s role in sex, as in life: liking stuff. We were trying to make men feel good, but the whole time teaching them they didn’t need to do the same for us. “I think I’m just one of those people who doesn’t like sex,” a girl friend of mine said at the time, glum but resigned after a disappointing night with her boyfriend. When I was 15, MindGeek bought Pornhub, making millions of videos available for free each week. In the absence of any other guidelines, my friends and I continued to be influenced by what we saw, trying for something most of us weren’t getting much enjoyment out of. Porn stars were bald from the eyebrows down, and as we viewed them as the prototype, we copied what they did, removing what little hair was already there. I remember sitting on the bathroom tiles aged 17, breathing through my mouth in order to avoid that eggy sulphur smell in Veet hair removal cream. I moved on to razors when the hairs became coarser, ones that gave shaving rashes so itchy I often had to leave class to furiously dig my nails into the ingrown hairs. It felt more orgasmic than anything a man was doing to me. “But why would you want to look like a child?” Mum asked when she heard about girls my age giving themselves Brazilians. I just thought she didn’t get it, like she didn’t get Paramore or clothes from American Apparel. Truthfully, I didn’t give much thought to the performers in these videos and what they might be going through for my entertainment. I know, of course, that for many women it is impossible to enjoy something that is so obviously foregrounded in male pleasure at the expense of the women on screen. At the time, mainstream feminism seemed to associate almost anything sexual with liberation, and any criticisms of porn as puritanical. I was more aware of the arguments people used to patronise porn stars – telling them they couldn’t be enjoying their work even as they said they were – than I was of the porn stars themselves. But in 2015 a number of reports emerged about abuse on porn sets. I tried watching ethical porn, directed and filmed by women, but it was often behind a paywall. I wasn’t used to paying for porn, so I would stay only until the free trial ran out. From what I did see, a lot of ethical porn looked the same to me – only instead of naughty nurses on screen, the women were art dealers, and there was a nicer filter on the video. At university I got a laptop and a door with a lock on it, and then I started watching more porn. I realised that, with more of it in my life, any masturbation unaccompanied by porn made it almost impossible to climax. I used to spend ages dreaming up long, complex scenarios about teachers telling me off or that guy who smoked out of the window of the block of flats opposite. But porn made all that easy: you didn’t have to think at all because it was right there in front of you, screaming yes, yes, yes. Even if afterwards it left you with a distaste on your tongue, like when you’ve eaten loads of crisps. When I tried to masturbate without it, my hand would cramp up and all the images I tried to invent faded out. I couldn’t see anything but blankness. So I’d open up my screen again and type in “amateur”. I can see how for some people it can begin to eclipse their whole sex life. The dopamine rush from it hits you like a kick in the teeth. I spoke a lot about porn with my peers; especially my male friends. I knew that one liked glossy videos featuring women with big fake breasts, because he wanted the escapism that came from watching someone he probably would never sleep with in real life. I often dropped porn into conversation, because I was desperate to be a “cool girl” in their eyes. Someone who drinks beer and plays video games. And cool girls definitely watched porn. Only later would I find out that some of these men were questioning their own relationship with porn; that they wanted to cut down on it. A friend of mine told me that her ex-boyfriend used to watch porn on his phone four times a day, mostly in the toilet cubicle of his office building. Once, over coffee, she described to me what sex with him was like. “He could only come in one really specific position,” she said and then tried to demonstrate it to me: he would stand up and she’d be upside down on her head with her ankles either side of his head. “Often he’d shush me because he needed to concentrate on what he was doing.” My friend claimed she didn’t really mind – she just accepted she’d be uncomfortable. We’d all learned to prioritise male pleasure. I’m 26 now and porn is everywhere. Fifteen million UK adults said they watched porn during the pandemic. And while it kills off some people’s imaginations, it inflames others, encouraging people to become more experimental in their sex lives. Lots of my friends watch it with their partners to help them think of new positions; some have discovered their queerness through it, or kinks they had no idea about. You see this in how many guys nowadays are willing to try rimming. Initially seen as quite a taboo sexual practice, it became popularised through porn. Then rappers began referencing it in their lyrics (most notably Megan Thee Stallion’s “If he ate my ass he’s a bottom feeder” and Jhené Aiko’s “Gotta eat the booty like groceries” in Omarion’s Post to Be). Finally, it manifested in memes. It is so common now that when I was watching football with eight guy mates, they all said they do it essentially every time they have sex. I asked the only other girl at the table what she thought. “It’s quite nice having men do something … ” She paused for a moment because she couldn’t find the right word. “Something like that for our pleasure.” Porn does this a lot. It takes something previously considered niche and shows it again and again in a mainstream context until it becomes normalised. Before, if you wanted to see rough sex, you had to search deep into the corners of the internet to find it. After Pornhub and other websites like it put BDSM right next to “blowjobs” and “lesbian” and all the other categories, this made it much easier to find. By the end of university, between this, Fifty Shades of Grey and my own insecurities, I had internalised the idea that if you weren’t into hardcore stuff, you were boring in bed. A guy pulled my hair and all I could think about was whether any of it had fallen out. Someone left bruises on my bum from spanking and I dug my nails into my fist like I do when I’m getting a tattoo or a piercing and I want to distract myself from the pain. And throughout both of those experiences, I stayed true to the lesson I had learned all those years ago when I first watched porn: I pretended to like it. This pretence was present in a lot of other aspects of my life. I nodded along when men told me about albums I had already listened to, acted impressed by films I thought were boring. It’s hard to see what came first: whether I pretended to like things in life because I’d learned to do so in bed, or whether learning to do it in bed meant I did so more in life. All I know is that my entire personality was built around wanting to please. Some of my friends had worse interactions, where things veered into the nonconsensual. “He put his hand round my neck,” began a friend; she had been at a festival and gone back to a guy’s tent. “It was light at first, so I was all right with it, but he was doing it so hard I started to panic. When he stopped, I felt light-headed.” My friend is far from alone in this. In 2019, a BBC survey found that more than a third of UK women under 40 have experienced “unwanted slapping, choking, gagging or spitting” during consensual sex. A lot of people would blame this on porn, including the Centre for Women’s Justice, which said: “This is likely to be due to the widespread availability, normalisation and use of extreme pornography.” I disagree. Violence against women has a lot more to do with a society that emboldens men to position their desires above women. Though I do think there’s something to say about the way porn blurs many of the nuances of sex, especially when it comes to rough sex. In kink communities, a heavy emphasis is placed on consent: safe words and no-goes. Most porn videos show these practices – choking, restraining, spanking – without showing scenes of consent, which is necessary in order to ensure they’re safe and enjoyable for those participating. That’s fine if it’s a fantasy but not when you’ve never been taught to interpret it as such. My friends and I grew up with porn, but we still had a couple of years of development without it. Old phones using 3G took ages to load sites, and there were far fewer videos to choose from. But teenagers now can access it whenever they want to. In 2019, research commissioned by the British Board of Film Classification [pdf] saw more than half of 11- to 13-year-olds admitting to watching porn, rising to 66% of 14- to 15-year-olds. Sex education hasn’t changed much since I was growing up, and in a world that has become even more digital, teenagers are at real risk of receiving entirely wrong messaging about porn and sex. More and more they seem to think that porn is sex and sex is porn, and that is confirmed every time they open up their phone and watch it without anyone in school or at home telling them any different. I’m not against porn, but kids need to be told that it’s a fantasy projection, like made-up storylines on Made in Chelsea, or a show home. I hope that future generations demand more from their sex life; that they come of age with an enhanced sense of what is real and what is fake. In 2020 the government updated official guidance on relationships and sex education, for the first time in 20 years. Now compulsory from primary school, sex education must cover consent, abortion and domestic abuse. There’s also a large portion of guidance on the evolving digital cultures of sex and relationships, including sexting and porn. It shouldn’t be too hard to improve, given the last government guidance came before Instagram or iPhones. Disappointingly, though perhaps predictably, there’s no mention of pleasure. There is also concern over the flexibility of the new guidance. Schools are not being handed a curriculum but are being asked to develop their own based on the government guidelines, which are far from comprehensive. Topics to be covered are listed without any information about when or how they should be taught, meaning reluctant schools could get away with teaching one or two classes before heading back to the textbook. And given the opposition to schools teaching sex education in detail – one sex educator in the US was bombarded by the press for offering “masturbation videos for first-graders” after showing a cartoon in which two characters used anatomically correct names for their genitals – it’s likely this will be the path most taken. A teacher couldn’t have got there in time to shield my eyes from what I saw on that phone when I was 13, but they could have explained to me what to think when I did see stuff like that. Such as: porn isn’t real, all bodies look different, very often you have to show people how to touch you, and there’s a lot of trial and error involved. Yes, it can look clumsy when you change positions, but no one remembers those bits anyway. How few orgasms come that easy. That sex is a bit like a packet of Revels, where you might love the chocolate counters but hate the coffee-flavoured ones, and just because they’re all in the same packet doesn’t mean you’ll like them all. In the same way that you might like getting tied up by your hands but hate another form of bondage. Not to judge a penis by its size because sometimes it can have some imperceptible bend in it that leaves you screaming. How sometimes sex is lazy and slow and much hotter for it. That there are times when you don’t think you’re going to orgasm and then suddenly you’re twitching on the bed like roadkill. Then I would have enjoyed porn from an arm’s-length distance rather than trying to bring it into my bed and act it out, like a ventriloquist’s dummy. I still watch porn, but I don’t see it as a manual on how I should behave. I see it as a way of getting out of my head after a long day, something to make me excited about sex again when things have stagnated with a partner. I’ve become more confident and, as a result, men’s approval seems less pivotal, making it easier to say what I want, both during sex and outside it. Male pleasure is not the only focus. What I want is, too. Plus, I have other ways to learn. I’m not afraid of embarrassing myself in front of my girl friends any more, so I ask lots of questions about sex. “Do you guys still shave everything off?” I asked one of my girl friends the other day. “No, I stopped that a while ago,” she said. “I want to look more womanly now.” Recently, I’ve been thinking about growing my pubic hair out, but I don’t even know what colour those short, dark spikes would smooth out into. I’m naturally strawberry blond, so maybe it would be ginger? Or mousy brown? I asked another friend who trims and waxes hers into a bikini line and she sent me a reference picture. And I thought about how strange it is that I’m so far away from my body that I don’t even know what the natural state of it might look like. But I’ll find my way back.",News/Society,What has growing up watching porn done to my brain – and my sex life?,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/12/what-growing-up-watching-porn-has-done-to-my-brain-and-sex-life
2/12/2022,"Around the Tory heartland of Chichester, the government’s promise to build 300,000 homes a year has prompted loyal followers to take to the streets in protest. At first glance it might look like nimbyism, but dig deeper and the uprising exposes a problem that touches on England’s national infrastructure, the climate crisis and an ongoing environmental scandal.  People in the towns, villages and hamlets stretching west and south from Chichester live in an area served by Southern Water, which was fined a record £90m last year for illegally discharging billions of litres of raw sewage into the protected coastal waters off the south coast of Hampshire and Kent. Much of the sewage infrastructure in the area is at capacity or nearly at capacity, as the case against the water company exposed. Chichester, Thornham, Lavant and Bosham wastewater treatment works have been identified by Southern Water as “environmentally constrained” – they cannot take more volumes without harm to the environment. But the pressure is on areas such as Chichester to take their share of the government’s housing target. According to the district council, the allocation for the area is 638 dwellings a year from 2021 to 2039, equating to 10,778 over the whole period. In the next five years alone, it means Chichester and its surrounding areas will host more than 3,000 new homes under government allocation. Nearly 70% of the land, however, is a national park, so the housing would be concentrated in 20-30% to the west and south of the city. The government has so far refused requests by the council to be treated as an exceptional case and have its housing allocation reduced. Susan Taylor, the council’s deputy leader and cabinet member for planning, said it was working on a review of its local plan to show ministers what level of housing might be achievable. “We have publicly said that we do not believe this target is achievable as things stand, due to infrastructure constraints,” said Taylor. One problem is transport links, with heavy congestion on the A27. Sewage infrastructure is another concern. “Wastewater treatment plants are reaching the limits of their permits and headroom,” Taylor said. To keep the system from backing up into people’s homes, untreated sewage and wastewater continues to be discharged, often for days at a time, from treatment works into Chichester harbour, one of the most highly protected marine environments in England. Demonstrators who took to the streets last month carrying banners saying “Save our south coast” are concerned that any more pressure on wastewater treatment works will cause an environmental disaster. Mike Owens, who co-founded the Clean Harbours Partnership, said: “All five sewage treatment works close by are all at, or very close to, their maximum capacity, yet development continues unabated and Southern Water investment plans are not accurately tracking demand. We are now at a stage where, due to insufficient capacity, illegal sewage discharges are inevitably going to be routine, dumping human waste and unacceptable concentrations of chemicals into our harbours. “We are demanding that councils, water companies and regulators collaborate to … ensure any development does not proceed until sufficient and operational sewage infrastructure is in place to protect our precious environment.” If crumbling concrete and pipes are one issue, the threat of the climate crisis is another constraint on the scale of housebuilding demanded. Much of the land that would have to support housing is surrounded by water. On the Manhood peninsula, home to the coastal villages of East and West Wittering and Selsey, climate maps predict much of the land will be underwater in just a few decades. Joan Foster, the chair of the Save the Manhood Peninsula campaign, said: “The potential for sea level rises could put most of the Manhood underwater in 50 years’ time. It is simply immoral to build houses and ask people to settle there knowing this.” More than 5,000 people have signed a petition addressed to Michael Gove, the housing secretary, calling on him to stop development on the Manhood peninsula and in villages around the harbour. Several hundred people marched through Chichester last month. “Protesting like this is very unusual for Chichester. It is a true blue Tory seat but people are very concerned,” said Foster. She said the delay in completion of the review of the local plan – due in 2019 but now expected by 2023-4 – left the whole area vulnerable to speculative planning applications for housing from developers. Roger Mavity, also of the Save the Manhood Peninsula campaign, has collated data on development. He said there were 378 homes recently completed or under construction, 832 going through the planning application process, and space for a further 1,248 classified as “developable” under the housing and economic land availability assessment. “So that’s potentially 2,458 new homes on the drawing board as we speak,” he said. Next month developers will appeal against a refusal by the council to allow the building of 70 homes outside East Wittering. Sandra Norval, a future growth leader at Southern Water, said there were options to be explored such as using long sea outfalls for effluent, and in a project due to be completed this spring, wastewater was being diverted from Chichester treatment plants via a new pipeline to Tangmere wastewater treatment works, which does not discharge into the harbour. She said the company was working with the best available technology to remove nutrients from wastewater to the level required, and any increase in volumes into wastewater treatment plants would have to involve changing permits with the Environment Agency or using as yet undeveloped technology. The state of the sewage system presented a “challenging obstacle to development, which we are working hard to overcome, in partnership with all the key stakeholders in the area,” she said. A spokesperson from the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: “Councils, not central government, set their own housing targets in their local plan. Our guidance should be considered alongside local constraints, including the need for infrastructure to support new development, and consideration for the environment.”",News/Society,‘Sewage discharges will be routine’: Chichester protests at Tory housing targets,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/12/sewage-discharges-will-be-routine-chichester-protests-at-tory-housing-targets
2/12/2022,"Government attacks on judges and lawyers are fuelling distrust of the courts and encouraging bogus notions of ancient “common law” being pushed by conspiracy theorists, according to the Law Society. The use of bogus interpretations of common law to portray courts, fines and regulations, particularly in relation to the Covid-19, as invalid or wrong is becoming an increasingly common strand across the full spectrum of extremist groups, ranging from anti-vax conspiracy theorists to the far right.  The trend – which draws on non-existent common law and has seen activists handing out fake legal “writs” at schools and hospitals as well as alleging crimes by doctors and journalists – was a factor this week during the harassment of the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, when extremists in viral footage of the incident could be heard yelling at him to “protect the constitution”. It briefly brought what is a fringe theory into the public eye, and the movement is growing at pace on social media channels, anti-vaccine newspapers and in the real world. Training classes in bogus common law are being held around the country by a range of groups, in some cases run by military veterans who are blending it with training in civil disobedience tactics. One group is running classes around the country at up to £20 a person to train “an army of common law constables” who are “mandated to uphold constitutional laws” by exercising arrests and attending where the “rights of members are subject to intervention from bailiffs, council employees or police officers and other agencies”. It claims to have trained 850 “constables.” Beyond the activities of extremist groups, the bogus theories have gained traction among members of the public such as a York hair salon owner who was fined thousands of pounds after attempting to keep her business open during lockdown by putting a sign in the window citing article 61 of Magna Carta. However, legal figures warned that a number of factors may be fuelling the growth of the bogus theories, while experts on extremism warned of the potential long-term risks for the growth of activism which regarded courts, authorities and the government as illegitimate. Ellie Cumbo, head of public law at the Law Society, described what was being propagated as a “wildly out of date” notion of the law which had been superseded by the modern court system and civil procedure rules. In terms of such beliefs taking root, she added: “You might ask whether some government rhetoric around judges, such as during the Brexit debate and the case relating to the prorogation of parliament, has played a role.” Cumbo cited media coverage such as a Daily Mail headline describing judges during the Brexit debate as “enemies of the people” as well as a description in a Home Office video – since removed – of lawyers providing advice to migrants as “activist lawyers”. The Law Society has said the description was “misleading and dangerous”. Boris Johnson, who heavily criticised the supreme court in 2020 after judges ruled that his decision to suspend parliament was unlawful, has also previously claimed delays in the criminal justice system should be blamed on “lefty human rights lawyers”. Cumbo suggested that a programme of civic and constitutional education in schools, universities and adult education – recommended by the independent Human Rights Act review – could help to counter distrust and the fake interpretations of the law. However, others voiced concerns about the language used by politicians and the media. Sailesh Mehta, a barrister who also sits as a part-time crown court judge, said attacks on the rule of law were a worrying trend, including the vilification of judges, lawyers, the law and political opponents. He added: “A relatively recent variation has been an unjustified denial of the applicability of some laws and a reliance on ancient outdated laws (or even a made-up law) which the protester prefers to be bound by. If enough people subscribe to this pick-and-mix approach to law, then there will be an erosion of the rule of law which binds all democratic societies together.” Tim Squirrell, the head of communications at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, said the modern bogus common law movement had roots in US sovereign citizen movements, making its way to the UK via Canada. It had two strands, one revolving around resistance to the state and another focusing on pseudo-legal litigation to avoid paying income tax or debts. “It can boil down to a claim that by a clever sleight of hand you can get out of everything and that is really resonant with a lot of the conspiratorial thinking around Covid, that the vaccine is fake, lockdown is illegitimate and there is a duty to wake others up. “But concerns about it come along two lines. One is around the direct action in the form of harassment of politicians and others, citizens arrests and a pseudo-legal framework. If people believe they are vested with the power of the law then it can lead to them believing that they can enforce it. “Secondly, there might be less worry in the UK that the whole movement could turn violent, but there is always the potential for individuals who act, whether by citizens’ arrests or something else. Wherever you have real conflict with the state there is also the potential for the creation of a martyr, particularly in a febrile political environment.”",News/UK news,Ministers accused of fuelling conspiracy theorists’ bogus ‘common law’ ideas,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/12/ministers-accused-of-fuelling-conspiracy-theorists-bogus-common-law-ideas
