12/25/2021,"From La Perouse in Sydney to Victoria’s French Island and South Australia’s Fleurieu Peninsula, hints of early French exploration dot the country’s coastline. In fact, French familiarity with our region was such that they were the first to print a near-complete chart of Australia’s coast in 1811, beating the British by three years. But for a few other historical quirks, at least part of the nation might now be Francophone.  That map, contained within an extensive collection of French books held at the State Library of Victoria, was recently shown to France’s ambassador to Australia, Jean-Pierre Thébault, in a private viewing. The ambassador, a history buff and collector of rare books, was cheered by the reminder of the deep connections between his country and the land that became Australia. Unlike many official visitors, the ambassador “sparked up right away”, says Des Cowley, the principal librarian for the history of the book at the library, recalling a “witty and chatty” visit. The map was the product of the 1801-04 voyage of the explorer Nicolas Baudin, whose crew charted much of the southern coastline, helping to determine that the continent was a single island. It also includes the description of “La Terre Napoleon”, covering much of what is now Victoria and South Australia. French explorers had touched on several parts of the continent’s coast in the years before Britain established its convict colony. Louis-Antoine, Comte de Bougainville, had his ship’s westward passage blocked by the outer shoals of the Great Barrier Reef in June 1768, two years before Captain James Cook’s Endeavour passed through the same area and claimed the east coast for Britain. In March 1772 two French expeditions were at opposite ends of the continent, and in one case made an explicit claim for territory. Marc-Joseph Marion Dufresne visited Tasmania and stayed briefly with the Indigenous people, while off the far north-west coast, Francois de Saint-Alouarn was burying two bottles containing statements of proclamation on Dirk Hartog Island. Archaeologists found one bottle in 1998 – now in WA’s Maritime Museum. When the First Fleet arrived at Botany Bay on 18 January 1788, it was followed a mere six days later by two vessels under the command of Jean François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse. A young Corsican named Napoleon Bonaparte enlisted, but just missed out on joining Laperouse’s ill-fated exploration voyage – both ships were wrecked in Solomon Islands and the crew lost. But Baudin’s charting of the southern coast, including his meeting with his much better-known English counterpart Matthew Flinders at Encounter Bay (now in South Australia) is perhaps the most intriguing. By that time the Napoleonic wars were in full swing in Europe, raising fears among the British that global expeditions might threaten its young and relatively feeble colony. Danielle Clode, an associate professor in humanities at Flinders University and an authority on French exploration of the Pacific, says the received understanding by many Australians is that after 1788 “from there on in, the British owned the entire continent”. “But that wasn’t the case at the time – the English claim on Australia was very tenuous,” she says. “The French made them extremely nervous because they kept coming in exploring … and so they were always anxious that the French were going to claim part of the country.” But Clode says France was not “highly motivated to undertake colonial activities” at the time of Baudin’s expedition, having had “a revolution to deal with”. Rather, the main purpose of the voyage was to map territory, gather scientific knowledge and collect specimens of flora and fauna. Baudin himself was a product of revolutionary tumult, rising through the merchant navy in contrast to the noble pedigree of many of the officers and even the scientists serving under him. As Clode notes in her book Voyages to the South Seas, he was an adept gatherer of specimens, having collected them in 1786 and 1792 in India and China in the service of Archduke Franz-Joseph of Austria. Baudin’s legacy, though, was deliberately obscured for many decades not least because those who wrote up the accounts of the voyage, particularly the naturalist François Peron, intensely disliked Baudin and omitted even naming him in their publications. Baudin died of tuberculosis in Mauritius in 1803, at the age of 49, but many thousands of pieces of scientific interest made it back to France, some to become part of empress Josephine’s collection. These included live plants as well as kangaroos, emus and black swans that Baudin had ordered to be kept safe from hungry sailors and cooks alike. Some officers lost their cabins to the menagerie, to give them a better chance of surviving the long voyage. “Les wombats”, sadly, did not make it. Whether Baudin was expected to press French claims for territory more energetically is unclear. Doubts remain about the veracity of a comment attributed to Napoleon that “Baudin did well to die, on his return I would have hanged him” for failing to contest Britain’s claims. However, Flinders wrote in his account of his circumnavigation of the continent that one of Baudin’s officers, Henri de Freycinet, told him: “If we had not been kept so long picking up shells and catching butterflies at Van Diemen’s Land, you would not have discovered the South Coast before us.” Although Baudin, like the English, busily gave names to dozens of places along the coast without asking what the Indigenous owners called their home, he expressed doubts about taking possession of them. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In a letter to governor Philip King in Sydney, whom he had befriended, the French explorer wrote: “To my way of thinking, I have never been able to conceive that there was justice or even fairness on the part of Europeans in seizing, in the name of their governments, a land seen for the first time, when it is inhabited by men who have not always deserved the title of savages or cannibals. “[I]t would be infinitely more glorious for your nation, as for mine, to mould for society the inhabitants of its own country over whom it has rights, rather than wishing to occupy itself with the improvement of those who are very far removed from it by beginning with seizing the soil which belongs to them and which saw their birth.” Thébault says that sentiment reflects the more universalistic characteristics of the Enlightenment. For Clode, whose work has also appeared in a documentary screened on SBS, the French forays can help change the way we think about our history. “We tend to see it as an inevitable progress towards where we are now,” she says. “The interesting thing is to see what could have been, if things had been slightly different.”",News/Science,French coast: the early explorers who sparked British fears of a Francophone Australia,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/dec/25/french-coast-the-early-explorers-who-sparked-british-fears-of-a-francophone-australia
12/25/2021,"You’ve navigated Christmas lunch. Everyone has eaten and drunk well. Peace and harmony reign. So now it’s time to tackle the washing up. Or is it? Certainly, it’s sobering to face a Kosciuszko-sized pile of grimy plates and glassware. But if you’re still feeling a post-lunch booze glow, experts suggest you defer dealing with the dirt – at least when it comes to caring for precious stemware.  Ashley Iredale is a whitegoods specialist at consumer advocacy group Choice and a wine fan. As part of his job, he studies how dishwashers and detergents function. So you might expect him to be pro-dishwasher, but no: not for wine glassware. “Modern dishwashers do a sterling job of washing stemware. Some models even have special glass holders. But personally, I recommend not using them,” he says. “Wine glasses are fragile and need gentle handling. If you put them in a dishwasher after a few glasses yourself, there’s potential for accidents,” he says. “You lose not only your wine glass, but you’ve got a dishwasher full of broken glass.” Repeated dishwashing has implications for the life of some stemware – glassware brand Riedel, for example, says its products can last up to 1500 washes in a Miele. Over time, the detergent itself in the dishwasher can also produce irreversible “cloudy discolouration,” adds Iredale. “This is not a film coating. It’s damage to the glass at a microscopic level.” Ian Trinkle is a former group sommelier at Brisbane’s busy Howard Smith Wharves and ex-head sommelier at shuttered fine diner Aria Brisbane. Recently, Trinkle opened a boutique wine store in the city’s inner north-east, but he’s hand-washed and polished hundreds of expensive wine glasses during his career. Unlike Iredale, he welcomes the ease a dishwasher brings to a boring chore. “I run all my glasses through the dishwasher – most are very safe these days and you don’t get any detergent build up.” “It’s much easier to break glasses when you’re doing them by hand because you have to get right inside the bowl to clean them,” he says. Feeling confused about which method is best? That’s because there’s no one-size-fits-all answer. Many upscale glass makers now recommend using a dishwasher – even for fine-stemmed wine glasses – so if you don’t want to hand-wash, it’s worth paying attention to cleaning instructions when buying glassware in the first place. If you do use a dishwasher, Iredale suggests disregarding internet advice about ditching rinse aid and soap. Choice lab testing has shown it’s better to use both, particularly rinse aid. “Rinse aid contains surfactants which reduce the viscosity of water, which means it sheets off rather than beading, which is why it helps avoid spots.” Still, he remains firmly team hand-wash. His pro tip for successful washing after heavy, Christmas-style use? Leave it until the morning after. Before you head for a nap, Iredale suggests diluting any wine residue in glasses with water, which will make cleaning easier. Then, the next day, use hot soapy water to hand-wash, employing a clean sponge and good quality washing-up liquid, as this method prolongs your glass’s lifespan. And if your wine glasses have serious red wine staining, use denture cleaner. It’s designed to shift tannins, and it works with teacups too. After hand-washing, Iredale says, simply air dry and buff off any streaks or spots with a soft, dry cloth. Don’t buff the base and bowl at the same time when hand polishing, and never hold a wine glass by the stem. Don’t use a twisting motion either – the tension could cause the stem to snap. Another way to ease tension over the matter? Just reduce the number of glasses you use. Over the past decade, so-called all-purpose or universal glassware – medium-sized glasses which can hold all types of wine without sacrificing function – have become popular with wine cognoscenti. Trinkle now uses the same style of glass for everything from pinot noir to riesling – and even champagne. But what about the environment – which washing method does the least damage here? The science is not cut and dried. Dr Simon Lockrey is an associate professor in sustainable design and innovation at Melbourne’s RMIT University. He’s studied the impact of both hand-washing and dishwashing reusable coffee cups. He says marketers and media prefer definitive answers from lifecycle studies, but he embraces the ambiguities. There are many variables to take into account – different dishwasher models and also styles of hand-washing – from what he calls “the bachelor rinse” (just 150 millilitres of water and no detergent) to a full sink of hot soapy water. “In layman’s terms it comes down to the energy source you use, how efficient that energy source is at heating the water and how efficient the method is at using water.” Human behaviour is key. If you’ve got a 20-litre sink and you’re only washing 20 items, that’s a litre per item. If you’re using a fully stacked dishwasher that’s super-efficient and reuses water, it’s likely to have less impact.

12/25/2021,"One always thought that going past Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo at the summit of individual achievement would require a different approach, and a different awarding criteria. No one could match their freakish numbers, and a new age would recognise something else – Luka Modric-esque artistry, or the sort of defensive mastery produced by peak Virgil van Dijk, for example.  The most remarkable aspect of Robert Lewandowski’s rise to the summit of the world game, then, is that he has done so by putting up cold, hard figures that compare with the two greatest of the past decade or so. If it is felt that the sport’s individual awards should be justified by team conquests – and February’s Club World Cup win meant Bayern became only the second club, after Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona, to rack up a sextuple – then Lewandowski’s continually climbing standards at the age of 33 made a pretty compelling solo case for recognition. On a purely individual level, beating Gerd Müller’s record for the most goals by a single player in a Bundesliga season was the high point. In early January, we knew it was on as he surpassed Müller’s Hinrunde record for the amount of goals scored in the first half of the Bundesliga campaign – Lewandowski had 21, compared to Müller’s 20 from 1968-69. Fast forward to May and his last goal of the season with virtually the last kick of the Bundesliga campaign, against Augsburg, saw him eclipse Müller’s tally of 40 from 1971-72 with his 41st, in the nick of time. It was wildly celebrated, and a magnificent moment that revealed just how much this meant to a publicly modest man. In the era of Messi and Ronaldo we have become almost numb to statistical excellence. Yet Lewandowski has entered the same realm as those two, where new milestones are required to find a way to describe his brilliance, because we’ve run out of superlatives. There were so many during 2021 – the most consecutive games scoring in the Bundesliga, scoring in the most home games in a row, scoring in nine straight Champions League games in multiple seasons, with going past Klaus Fischer into second on the Bundesliga’s all-time list and taking Raúl’s third place in the Champions League goalscoring table dotted in-between. The Müller season record really mattered, though. Partly because it was Müller, of course, and Lewandowski always showed his respect to the great man, revealing a T-shirt with Müller’s image on after equalling the record at Freiburg and spending time with Müller’s wife, Uschi, to let her know his admiration for her husband before his death in August. It was partly, too, because of the sheer scale of Müller’s achievement nearly 50 years ago. If we are desensitised to big numbers at elite level these days, this never extended to Der Bomber’s season record and its status in Germany. Most German football fans and journalists simply thought it would never be bettered. Lewandowski’s achievement in doing so is rightly recognised as genuinely remarkable in the country that has been his home for more than a decade. It wasn’t all plain sailing. That knee injury he sustained in Poland’s March win over Andorra (he scored twice before his night was curtailed, naturally) probably ended up wrecking his shot at the Ballon d’Or, keeping him out of both legs of the Champions League quarter-final with Paris Saint-Germain and making all the difference, as a Bayern side that were injury-hit but superior for much of tie were agonisingly eliminated on away goals. Injuries are a part of any tournament but the sheer insatiable drive of Lewandowski meant that the story of last year’s Champions League would not be complete without flagging his absence, when his fitness could have further garlanded Hansi Flick’s glorious spell in charge. Now established on the podium in the competition’s all-time scoring chart behind the big two, Lewandowski’s current fettle – improving, rather than simply maintaining – and his total (82) suggests that he is more likely than not to become the third player to pass 100 Champions League goals, which one fancies his chances of managing at some stage next season if little changes. Even Müller’s Bundesliga record total of 365 – another presumed insurmountable – isn’t off the table at the current lick (he is on 296), should he resolve to finish his career in Munich. Lewandowski’s all-round game remains formidable; he relishes physical combat with opposition defenders as much as he ever did – and is even better equipped for it these days, with significantly more muscle than when he arrived in Dortmund in 2010. As he ushered in December in time-honoured fashion by making his former club suffer in Der Klassiker (after that latest win on his return to Westfalen, he has scored 22 in 15 against his former employers in the Bundesliga alone – and has celebrated all of them), we were offered a reminder that there is no more dangerous Lewandowski than a defiant one. After a year in which he revealed himself as more like Messi or Ronaldo than we thought, he could be motivated to even greater heights in 2022 after this winter’s Ballon d’Or snub.",Sport/Football,Insatiable Robert Lewandowski now has stats to rival Messi and Ronaldo,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/24/robert-lewandowski-stats-rival-messi-ronaldo-no-1-top-100-footballers-in-the-world-2021
12/25/2021,"Whether you celebrate it religiously or socially, it’s hard to be distant from loved ones at Christmas. Emotional reunions at airports as people return home with the lifting of travel restrictions have been some of the most beautiful images of this year. Distance may be practical - caused by quarantine, closed borders, finances, work or inability to travel. But there’s another form of distance that many experience at these times of cultural importance. The kind of distance you can feel when sitting around the dinner table with your family or the painful chasm of being not invited at all. It’s the distance of judgement, shame and rejection based on religious, cultural or social norms that one has not conformed to.  A particular message is conveyed in every scriptural story of Jesus as he grows up and then completes his ministry. He becomes a refugee. Touches the “unclean” despite the religious law demanding otherwise; the five-times divorced foreign woman he meets at the well becomes a revered figure of Christian faith and a hated heretic Samaritan is the central heroic figure in the parable Jesus tells to explain what it really means to “love your neighbour as yourself”. The heretic is the hero. The unclean are equals. The divorced, the refugee, foreigner and the migrant, the despised, the rejected, the “sinners”, the culturally and the religiously unacceptable are all invited into his story and to eat at his table. This is the essence of the Christmas narrative, the “good news” that the angels sang about to the working class shepherds on the hill – everyone you thought was excluded is embraced. Everyone you thought was distant is brought near. Everyone you hoped would be uninvited is welcome. All of those your religious upbringing, cultural prejudice or social expectations make you feel uncomfortable about should be welcome at your table. Figuratively in society, and physically in your lives and communities. The substance of the Christmas narrative could have and should have set a value system for Western societies based on Christian tradition. Instead, Jesus’s radical example became fresh dogma for exclusion, control and shame. His message as recorded in Christian scripture targeted two groups – the religious people and their leaders who were doing the excluding and the people who were being excluded. His message was clear – to the religious - “You are wrong. They’re all in, all welcome”, to the rejected, “you don’t need to feel the shame they’re subjecting you to.” Everyone you thought was excluded is embraced. And not embraced as lesser people who should show gratitude that the faithful, obedient or pure should deign to show them entrance and worth – but equal, elevated and venerated. All people, all welcome, with all shame and prejudice dissipated and irrelevant. When we turn a value system into rigid religious or cultural dogma it becomes hard to translate it into practice in modern society. That’s why we see church leaders preaching about the good news of Christmas at the same time as demanding a Religious Discrimination Act that explicitly allows them to exclude those in our society they believe should not be embraced, or why we see Christians talking about radical selfless love also believing that their way of life is threatened by Muslim immigration, or opposing the Black Lives Matter campaign. The narrative of Jesus’ birth paints a picture of an alternative future where no one need be uninvited to Christmas lunch or feel distant although they eat the same meal.All the excluded are embraced. Every person equal and welcomed into all of society. At a time when it was a public disgrace, the mother of God was an unwed pregnant woman. May your Christmas table, your new years’ resolutions and our society regardless of culture or religion reflect this good news that angels sang about. As Mare of Easttown’s Deacon Mark said, “It is not our job to decide who is deserving, our job is only to love.”  Brad Chilcott is founder of Welcoming Australia",Opinion/Opinion,Remember at Christmas that Jesus’s radical message was to embrace the excluded | Brad Chicott,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/25/remember-at-christmas-that-jesuss-radical-message-was-to-embrace-the-excluded
12/25/2021,"As the James Webb space telescope hurtles away from Earth at 38,000km/h, its first communication will be with Canberra. CSIRO’s Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex is expecting to hear from the $13.6bn craft on Christmas night.  Nasa says the James Webb, which replaces the Hubble space telescope, will “gaze into the epoch when the very first stars and galaxies formed, over 13.5bn years ago”. But before it enters an orbit around the sun, it will check in with Canberra. Glen Nagle, from CSIRO’s Nasa tracking station, said it will be like receiving an email. “We know where it’ll be in our skies. We will lock on to the signal with our antenna, then we’ll refine the signal,” he said. “It’ll still be relatively close, not more than a few hundred kilometres away, but it’s going straight out. We’ll track it, follow it, as it accelerates to about 38,000km/h to reach escape velocity. “It’s sending a set of demands, the digital ones and zeroes and then the space craft sends back the info we’ll have asked for, which in this chase will be its health. Has it deployed its solar panels correctly, is it generating power, are all the systems on board OK?” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The team will also make sure it’s on the right course. Then they hand over to the Spain tracking station, who in turn will pass over to the US tracking station, before Canberra picks it up again about 20 minutes after it has separated from its main rocket. Then, 1.5m kilometres away from Earth, it will unfold its mirrors, its sunshield, and then astronomers will be able to use what it sees to study the beginning of the universe, as well as planets that could harbour liquid water and other signatures of habitability. Swinburne University of Technology scientists will be among those using the telescope’s findings. Prof Karl Glazebrook, from the Centre for Astrophysics and Supercomputing, will be using its optical and infrared capabilities. It will “revolutionise the study of space”, he said. “The telescope is up to a million times more sensitive to infrared than any ground-based telescope, allowing us to see back to the beginning of time, to the first stars and galaxies after the big bang, and solve some of the greatest mysteries of the universe.” Dr Benjamin Pope, from the University of Queensland, will work with an international team to enhance images from the telescope. “We will use hardware and new software to achieve very high resolution and contrast, in order to study the process of planet and star formation,” he said. After decades of planning, the telescope’s launch was delayed by high winds this week, but is now slated to blast off at 11.20pm AEDT on Saturday.",News/Science,James Webb: world’s most powerful telescope makes its first call to Australia on Christmas Day,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/dec/25/james-webb-worlds-most-powerful-telescope-makes-its-first-call-to-australia-on-christmas-day
12/25/2021,"Rebecca Miller is cooking up a Christmas Day feast – even though she can’t taste a thing. Both Miller and her partner Steven have Covid. They’ve cancelled their plans to go to Tasmania – where they were due to be celebrating her 50th birthday for 3 January, and his delayed 50th from last year. Instead they will spend Christmas at home in Adelaide instead, video-calling family and friends.  “Even though I’ve lost my sense of taste and smell, I’m still cooking up a full vego roast, a big stuffed butternut pumpkin with roast veggies,” Miller said. “We’ll do the things we normally do Christmas Day but without people. We’ll drink, we’ll have fun.” The couple are double vaccinated, and are now mostly recovered. “It turned around quickly to feeling quite normal again,” Miller said. “It’s quite surprising how good we feel.” The Millers are among thousands of Australians isolating this year. Some, like them, caught Covid. Others are close contacts, and still others are choosing not to go out and expose themselves as case numbers increase sharply. Ros Ben-Moshe, an adjunct lecturer at La Trobe University’s school of psychology and public health, said it is critical for people to connect with others if they’re isolating. “If you can, in some way, whether it’s FaceTime, Skype or Zoom, beam in to see another person’s face, that can be very comforting,” she said. “We’ve got some very clever brain cells called mirror neurons. So when I have a smile on my face, my brain is firing and wiring these mirror neurons and if that’s shared with someone, they also will have their own mirror neuron activity, and it’ll be enhanced.” Emma Stevens, from regional Victoria, is expecting a baby boy in mid-January. It’s a high-risk pregnancy in a high-risk time, and she didn’t want to take the chance of catching Covid, even though she’s double-vaccinated. “I’m so close now, and the numbers are up,” she said. “I’m actually really looking forward to some time, just me and him.” Stevens’ partner is spending Christmas with his children from a previous relationship, then he’ll isolate himself and get tested before joining her. While they’re apart they’re going to read the same book (The Lincoln Highway by Amor Towles) so they can talk about it. She’ll enjoy mince pies and custard, and virtual catch-ups with friends. Ben-Moshe said that finding things to be grateful for is another really important way to cope with being alone. “Rather than focusing on the obvious downer of not being with family or celebrating the way you want to, spend some time with a grateful mindset,” she said. “That will help steer your brain away from what you don’t have, to what you do have. That helps people from going down that emotional spiral.” Tracy Crisp’s son is a close contact, so the whole family is in isolation in Adelaide. The 52-year-old said she had been really sad, but often finds Christmas a bit sad anyway, “remembering all the people that aren’t there”. “But it’s fine. We’ve got pavlovas and cherries. It’ll be a nice day still.” That’s four pavlovas for four people in the house, with Crisp, her husband and one son ferrying food up to the other one, who’s confined to his room. “I am frustrated that here in SA … I’m not against borders opening, I just feel like we could have done it later,” she said. Ben-Moshe said another idea for people who are missing out is to look through photos of past Christmas celebrations with loved ones. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “When we do this and connect to the feeling, our brain relives these experiences as if it was happening in the present moment … tapping into wellbeing hormones such as our bodies’ antidepressant, serotonin, which is activated when we reminisce.” The Millers hope to be out by 3 January, which is Rebecca’s 50th birthday. But for now it’s home, the roast, and experimenting with food and drink without any flavour.

12/25/2021,"With all of the worrying news emerging from the fields of health and science this year, some of the incredible advances that occurred may have been overlooked. But there have been many weird and wonderful feats in the world of research. Life-saving tests, treatments and vaccines were developed and rolled-out – including those led by Australian doctors – and a world-first malaria vaccine for children was endorsed by the World Health Organization. A new species of dinosaur was discovered in south-west Queensland, adding to our understanding about how they evolved. We learned from Nasa that the much-feared asteroid, Apophis, won’t hit Earth for at least 100 years, so that’s a relief.  Meanwhile, approval was given for the construction of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) telescopes in Australia and South Africa, with hope that the two largest and most complex networks of radio telescopes, once built, will redefine our understanding of space. Guardian Australia asked some of the leading experts in a range of fields to share the scientific advances they found most interesting, inspiring, or surprising this year. Among the doom and gloom, there is much progress, innovation and hope to celebrate. President of the Australian Academy of Science, molecular biologist, and former chairman of CSL Limited The development and the success of RNA-based vaccines has had enormous global impact during the past year. There’s enormous short-term success but it also opens up a lot of potential long-term opportunities in delivering RNA as a vaccine for emerging diseases and also as a means of developing new therapeutics to treat a whole range of disorders. To get a new type of vaccine out there requires very big clinical trials because a crucial thing with a vaccine, of course, is safety. RNA research has been going on for decades. The difficulty in translating that into practical use in the vaccine area has been because we’ve got lots of great vaccines for other diseases. If you’ve got great vaccines that work already, it’s very hard for a new vaccine to enter the market. That was one impediment to the practical development of RNA vaccines, which the pandemic suddenly produced a reason for, [because] we needed something new.” Applied Antarctic ecologist and principal research scientist at the Australian Antarctic Division Antarctica is a bellwether for climate change impacts, with recent evidence of ecosystem collapse and that a major ice shelf in west Antarctica may fail within the decade. So for me, this year’s most exciting advance is not a discovery but solid investment in future Antarctic science, heralded by the arrival of Australia’s new icebreaker, RSV Nuyina, the most advanced polar research vessel in the world, and the initiation of not one, but three new university-based Antarctic research initiatives.” Medical virologist, Australian representative on the World Health Organization’s investigation into the origins of coronavirus, director of public health pathology at NSW Health. From my point of view, the origins of Sars-CoV-2 has been the big story. Knowing from where viruses and pandemics start is crucial to understanding the interactions between humans and animals, and how this is influenced by human behaviour, industrialisation, and climate change. Then once a virus has entered humans, how human actions affect its spread – travel, mass gatherings, the medical system, access to health care and other actions. We need this knowledge to prepare for the next pandemic – rest assured, there will be another one! This was then overlaid by the politics, to an extraordinary extent not seen before. Everyone was blaming each other for causing the pandemic, often to cover their own poor pandemic responses. This has led to secretiveness and suspicion, delay and obfuscation, denial and accusation. An investigation into the origins of a disease is core scientific and medical business – politics has made this an almost impossible task and has been depressingly ‘anti-science’. It needs to be fixed.” Director of the National Covid-19 Clinical Evidence taskforce, and Associate Professor at Cochrane Australia. In both my personal and professional roles, it’s incredibly difficult to look past the incredibly rapid development of effective Covid-19 vaccines in terms of amazing scientific advances over the last couple of years. But, in my other life I’m a wannabe astronaut, and I am completely astonished by Nasa’s Ingenuity helicopter, which has made 18 successful flights on a whole other planet in 2021! In a year when I’ve barely managed to leave my house, the ability to have helicopter flights on Mars seems even more like science fiction than it normally would.” Professor of ocean and climate dynamics at the University of New South Wales, and co-founder of UNSW’s Climate Change Research Centre I think the most important finding that came out in 2021 is a study relating to ocean conditions around the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), which locks up in total about seven metres of global sea level. Lose the WAIS and hundreds of millions of people worldwide would be displaced. The WAIS is known to be the most vulnerable component of the Antarctic ice sheet system and uncertainty about future melt rates is one of the biggest unanswered questions in polar climate science. The published ocean measurements were taken adjacent to Thwaites Glacier, which is the most rapidly changing outlet of the WAIS. Using an autonomous underwater vehicle, the study documents the first ever temperature, salinity and oxygen measurements at the Thwaites ice shelf front. The measurements revealed warm water impinging from all sides on what are known as ‘pinning points’ of the glacier – these are critical to ice-shelf stability. This confirms what scientists have long been concerned about for the Thwaites Glacier; namely that warm water is driving melting at key pinning points. The location of the warm water shows that there is an increased risk of unpinning of the glacier and increased melt of the WAIS.”",News/Science,Choppers on Mars and RNA jabs: the best scientific advances of 2021,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/dec/25/choppers-on-mars-and-rna-jabs-the-best-scientific-advances-of-2021
12/25/2021,"Coming back to Australia after doing most of my primary school years overseas involved a couple of moments of cultural discord – chief among them the bizarre, almost organic stage-musical moment of watching everyone suddenly break into The Nutbush, unrehearsed. But nothing has ever made me feel truly like I’m living in a strange make-believe country than when I first heard an Australian Christmas carol. I don’t know what it is about our national psyche, this urge to remake Christmas carols that are hyperspecific to our nation. But it probably has to do with climate dysphoria – when almost every Yuletide song mentions the snow, the fireplace, the warm eggnog and Santa getting frostbite and losing his fingers, the contrast between the Australian Christmas experience of a stinking hot summer day and various prawn-related crises becomes stark.  So let’s talk about how baffling these songs are to anyone from overseas, suddenly plonked into an Australian Christmas. Now this song is pretty easy for people to understand: almost a parody of the original 12 Days of Christmas, with the various birds of the original (turtledoves, geese, French hens, etc) replaced with Australian birds (galahs, emus, kookaburras). I think most people would quickly understand what is happening here, a bird-for-bird lyrical equivalence. However, it did make me realise that the original carol is mostly about being given various birds for Christmas, and some jewellery, before it suddenly escalates into maids, pipers, ladies and lords-a-leaping (which is a surreal and potentially problematic gift). Australia doesn’t really have any of those things, so it kind of sheepishly continues the native fauna motif instead, ending with some numbats. Numbats are confusing for most people (half wombat, half emotionally repressed?), but any questions brought up by this song could be solved by an informative book or an educational trip to the zoo. Confusion rating: Not very confusing. Australian rating: Definitely a good list of Australian flora and fauna. Amount of birds: Almost all birds. Similar to the last entry, Aussie Jingle Bells takes the original beloved Jingle Bells carol and makes it “Aussie”. Instead of snow, we have bush; instead of a sleigh, a “rusty Holden ute”. It’s a game of juxtaposition, inverting the tropes of Christmas as put forward by Jingle Bells, and proposing the realities of what Christmas is like in Australia – hot, “beaut” and featuring someone named Uncle Bruce. Most people from overseas, even if they don’t understand exactly what an “Uncle Bruce”-type figure entails (I would say off-colour jokes and the propensity to monologue at the dinner table), would quickly understand the clever game of replacement that this carol is playing. Confusion rating: Still not very confusing. Australian rating: A kind of idealised version of rural Australia is put forward here, which is perhaps a more mythological idea of what being Australian is. Amount of birds: No birds unfortunately, but there is a kelpie (a dog). Here we have another Australian Christmas carol, which I believe is extremely popular in primary schools around the country and which once again notes Australia’s wealth of interesting birds. However, unlike The 12 days of Aussie Christmas, we are given no inkling that this song is meant to be about birds unless you read the title (which is never mentioned in the song). Instead, the listener is launched into a terrifying world of “brolgas” dancing, “lifting their feet like war horses prancing”. I’ve never heard of a brolga, and they sound terrifying. Confusion rating: Quite confusing. Australian rating: I think the most Australian thing about this song is being forced to sing it at school assembly. Amount of birds: Just so many birds, but also mostly birds I have never heard of before. “Across the plains one Christmas night / Three drovers riding blithe and gay.” Now this is an old Australian Christmas carol, credited to 1948, and upon close reading, I have discovered that the drovers are meant to be a stand-in for some famous shepherds of biblical myth and are assumed to be recognisable as such. Furthermore, I have discovered that drovers are, in fact, basically Australian shepherds. There is a lot of assumed knowledge in this carol, and without it, it seems like it’s a song about three men who see a UFO and start singing. Confusion rating: Very confusing. Australian rating: The word “drover” does a lot of heavy lifting here as an Australian concept. I think it’s great that we get drover representation in Australian Christmas carols; it’s very important that young drovers are able to see themselves in popular art. Amount of birds: Not a lot of birds, but some black swans are mentioned, and it’s wonderful that Natalie Portman’s tour de force is still being namechecked. Not so much a carol, but apparently Australia’s most popular Christmas song – a classic festive tale of a criminal, perhaps even a murderer, who is extremely concerned with the right way to make gravy on Christmas Day and is calling from inside a prison to deliver his recipe. Now, I don’t know what about this song resonates with the Australian public, other than Paul Kelly’s voice which is that of a laidback bourbon angel, but I would say this is the most baffling to an outsider by far. Does it imply that every Australian citizen has a deep parasocial relationship to correct gravy recipes? Sure. Does it also normalise the idea of most Aussies either having spent a bunch of time in prison or having loved ones in the clinker? Also yes. Confusion rating: Absolutely baffling. Australian rating: Geographically, this song is very specific, mentioning some classic Australian locations (Queensland) as well as the great Aussie tradition of talking about how hot it’s gonna be. Amount of birds: One, a jailbird, who is singing.",Arts/Music,Australian Christmas songs ranked by how baffling they are to literally anyone else,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/25/australian-christmas-songs-ranked-by-how-baffling-they-are-to-literally-anyone-else
12/25/2021," Lee Anderson MP, shrugging off the critics in July after his boycott of England didn’t catch on. Anderson, who called players taking the knee at the Euros “an attack on our very way of life”, said he wasn’t bothered about being mocked: “I don’t go on Twitter because it’s full of idiots.” Also getting involved last summer, but taking a more nuanced view: Boris Johnson, rejecting England players’ anti-racist “gestures and symbols” in June before they started winning – then posing on a giant anti-racism cross of St George in July with extra England bunting. Priti Patel, backing the booing of knee-takers in June due to players’ cheap “gesture politics”, then putting on England kit in July to slam the “vile” racists. And Tory MP Brendan Clarke-Smith, comparing England players taking the knee to players performing the Nazi salute in 1938 – then showing off his C’Mon England wallchart on Twitter. Was the then education secretary, Gavin Williamson, sitting down with the Evening Standard in September to relaunch himself after a run of missteps. Standard: “Many of his critics have been high profile, including Marcus Rashford who called for an urgent review of free school meals. Has he met the footballer? ‘We met over Zoom and he seemed incredibly engaged, compassionate and charming but then he had to shoot off. I didn’t want to be the one that was holding him back from his training.’ Later Williamson’s team tell me he actually met the rugby player Maro Itoje, not Rashford.” Uefa – moving to “send a clear signal” in April by banning Slavia Prague’s Ondrej Kudela for 10 games for racism, and Rangers’ Glen Kamara for three games for reacting to it. @BorisJohnson – left reeling again in November by news that, in the past, people had used offensive racist language. “Brave testimony from Azeem Rafiq. I commend him for speaking out. There is no excuse for racism anywhere in society.” Juventus Women saying sorry in August after tweeting a photo with matching emojis of defender Cecilia Salvai using her fingers to narrow her eyes. Juve clarification: “This tweet was not meant to have any racial undertones.” And Serbia’s Volleyball Federation apologising after Sanja Djurdjevic did the same thing in a game against Thailand, four years after the whole team posed for a photo doing it in Japan. “We apologise sincerely. But please, don’t blow this out of proportion! Sanja didn’t mean any disrespect.” Lazio – demanding Amazon Prime delete an “odious” scene in their Maradona drama where the lead character refers to Lazio as “fascists”. The club said the scene – aired a month after their eagle mascot handler gave fascist salutes as fans sang a Mussolini tribute chant while Mussolini’s great-grandson made his first-team breakthrough – had “clear defamatory intent.” @Nigel_Farage in September, finally finding a Romanian family he’d live next door to. “A global megastar is born. @EmmaRaducanu winning the US Open – truly incredible.” Boris Johnson – standing up for fans by slamming the European Super League “cartel” in April and threatening a “legislative bomb” to stop it, days after Manchester United’s Ed Woodward left No 10 with “the impression Johnson was in favour of it”. No 10 source: “Boris doesn’t know much about football so he said it was a great idea. So Dan [Rosenfield, chief of staff] told the clubs No 10 wouldn’t stand in their way. Then it all kicked off …” The Premier League: launching their new owners’ charter in August to “protect the integrity of our game”, committing owners to “core principles” of fair play, equality and human rights, two months before signing off Newcastle’s takeover. The Premier League: relaxing rules for Saudi Arabia, but not for the homeless charity Shelter, who wanted clubs to wear away kits on Boxing Day. “Clubs are entitled to support charitable causes… provided it is in compliance with Premier League rules.” The Premier League: backing the first #GameZero carbon-neutral match in September to “raise awareness of the threat of climate change and inspire fans to make simple changes to reduce their carbon footprint”, a week before shareholders held fresh talks over staging “meaningful matches” abroad – a new “attempt to grow the game”. Came from Japan’s Olympic organisers – handing out 160,000 free condoms to athletes in June with a warning not to use them. Organisers said anyone engaging in “unnecessary forms of physical contact” amid strict Covid rules faced fines or deportation: “The condoms are not meant to be used at the Olympic Village.” Uefa’s PR team – releasing a rainbow-coloured Uefa badge in June in a bid to stem a run of tough headlines over Uefa’s Euro 2020 decisions to ban the Allianz Arena using rainbow colours, to investigate Manuel Neuer for wearing them and to ban sponsors using them to avoid upsetting Russia. Uefa said the badge “embodies our core values, promoting everything that we believe in”. At a tournament where fans had rainbow flags confiscated: teenage pitch invader Finn-Luca taking a rainbow flag to the Hungary team to protest against the country’s anti-gay laws. Fans crowd-funded his fine. Came for Uefa’s Europa Conference League in December – the tournament already struggling for credibility before a dog invaded the warm-up at Partizan Belgrade and fouled the pitch while staring into the camera. 3.3m views. Was carried out by Concacaf in September after Ronnie Brunswijk – Suriname’s 61-year-old vice-president, ex-rebel leader, bank robber, father of 50, convicted drug trafficker and owner of Inter Moengotapoe – named himself captain in a Concacaf League game. Brunswijk played an hour at Ronnie Brunswijkstadion, subbed himself off then handed out cash to opponents. Concacaf said the episode had raised certain “integrity concerns” and, after “considering written statements”, banned him. Sepp Blatter, 85, denying wrongdoing. “What can you do against the international media … People should realise that I have given 41 years into the Fifa. What I have done for football, they should appreciate.” Sepp’s 2021 festive message: “I am not a criminal.” April: Spurs’ new paint partner @DuluxUK apologising after their tweets mocking Spurs unsettled the fanbase: “These posts do not reflect how proud we are to be the Official Paint Supplier.” November: Spurs announcing their new Italian manager in Spanish, deleting it and trying again. July: Spurs plugging their bold new multicoloured kit with the tweet: “Describe this kit in one word.” 3,400 people did. August: Everton tweeting a video eulogy to fans who died in the pandemic, having failed to vet online submissions, resulting in tributes to Faye Knewse and Mike Oxsmall. July: Adidas using an image of Millie Turner to launch the new Manchester United home kit under their “never forget where you came from” tagline, captioning her “Amy Turner”. And March: Manchester United’s social media operator going live on Instagram by mistake. 37,000 fans watched as they microwaved their lunch. From @CurzonAshton’s in-play feed, 27 Nov: “15, Pause in play as the ref needs to move his car.” Runner-up: 13 Nov, @MarineAFC: “Thanks to @dunstonutsfc player Philip Turnbull for attempting to fix our floodlights.” Was for neighbours at a locked-down Marine watching Spurs win 5-0 in January. @Cmcm1991: “Watching Gareth Bale whilst leaning out my window. Unreal”; Bale sent back a waving emoji. Marine sold 30,697 virtual tickets for £10 each. 2021’s best use of excess time online.

Fans said the tweet criticising the renaming of the Motera Stadium was “sedition … This is India’s internal matter. We will teach you a lesson of lifetime. #BoycottSpiderman.” My apologies to @SpiderManMovie. I should have remembered that with great power comes great responsibility. Standing out in a solid 12 months of sportswashing: Arsenal: denying making bad choices in March after taking £40m shirt-sleeve money from a Rwandan regime which denies serial human rights abuse and skewing poverty figures: “We have worked together to challenge perceptions and tell Rwanda’s story of culture, heritage and transition – as well as raising awareness of the country as a luxury holiday destination.” Fifa head Gianni Infantino: starring in a Saudi Arabian government video in January doing a ceremonial sword dance and telling the camera: “This country is amazing, incredible, the world should come and see.” Infantino told critics: “Engagement is the best way to make change happen.” And David Beckham, signing a reported £150m deal to front Qatar’s rebrand. A source told the Sun: “By signing David, the hope is more westerners will be encouraged to see Qatar’s beautiful beaches, vast expanses of sand dunes and incredible skyscrapers.” BT Sport, 22 Oct: “There’s been speculation about you Steven, what would you say to those linking you with a move away from Rangers?” Steven Gerrard: “Do I look happy? Do I look settled? Don’t ask me silly questions then.” 11 Nov: Joins Villa. 20 Jan: Brescia’s former Leeds owner Massimo Cellino moves to shake off his unfair media “manager eater” image by extending new coach David Dionigi’s contract to 2022 to guarantee proper stability. 4 Feb: Sacks him. 28 Oct: Norwich sporting director Stuart Webber lays into “disgraceful” headlines about Daniel Farke. “To be questioning Daniel at this point would be incredibly unfair. This isn’t about focusing on one man.” 6 Nov: Focuses on one man. Genoa president Enrico Preziosi, styling out an 11-year epic. Nov 2010: Preziosi hires coach Davide Ballardini as a long-term fix for “a brighter future”. June 2011: Sacks him. “I told him on the phone, he’s done here.” Jan 2013: Offering “a second chance”, rehires Ballardini. May 2013: Sacks him. “I say this now: me and Ballardini, we will never, ever meet again.” Nov 2017: Seeking fresh ideas, rehires Ballardini. Oct 2018: Sacks him. “I consider Ballardini to be a terrible coach. He doesn’t know how to put his players on the pitch, he can’t do anything, he provides such a terrible spectacle. I don’t enjoy firing him, but the decision was inevitable. He’s a terrible coach. Hiring him was my mistake.” Dec 2020: Rehires Ballardini. Nov 2021: Sacks him, then sells the club. “Over the years I had many clashes with Ballardini. But it’s clear that I do respect the guy. You know, I don’t speak ill of anyone. It’s just something I’ve never done.” Hamilton Academicals, sacking in-house co-commentator Bobby Bulloch in February after he started the second half silent then said: “Sorry, I hadn’t pressed the button when I went away for a jobby at half-time, excuse my language, and I’ve not pressed the wee button when I’ve come back.” Hamilton: “A contractor used by the club overstepped the mark. The person will not be used again.” Came from Everton fans in June, trying to put off Rafa Benítez. The Guardian: “Animosity towards the 61‑year‑old has already spilled over into personal abuse on banners … one left near his family home in Wirral warned: ‘We know where you live,’ although it was left outside the wrong house.” Was in March: Dinamo Zagreb coach Zoran Mamic meeting the press before their Europa League last-16 tie with Spurs. Mamic told them he was quitting after being sentenced to jail for stealing £13m then fled the country. He denies wrongdoing.

Rahm called it “one of those moments where how we respond defines us”, then won the US Open, his first major, a fortnight later. Australia’s ABC News Breakfast sports presenter Tony Armstrong on Tim Paine’s fitness in September, two months before Paine’s sexting scandal broke. “Tim Paine is set to undergo neck surgery but medical staff remain confident the veteran will be fit for the Ashes. Paine has a bulging dick that has… disc that has been causing pain.” Co-host: “A bulging what?” Armstrong: “I said disc.” Snooker’s Shaun Murphy, weighing up amateur Si Jiahui beating him in November. “He shouldn’t even be in the building. Amateurs shouldn’t be allowed in professional tournaments, the end. This is our livelihood. This is how I put food on the table.

12/25/2021,"Christmas Day will start early at Sydney’s Wayside Chapel. From about 6am volunteers will be blocking off the street and “rolling out the green carpet”. “We’re going to cover Hughes Street in astroturf and lay down some picnic blankets, appropriately socially distanced spots reserved for our very important guests,” the Kings Cross charity’s chief executive, Pastor Jon Owen, says, adding: “many of whom will be waking up in the gutter that morning.”  The Wayside Chapel is among many Australian organisations that will open its doors to those with nowhere else to go on Christmas Day, offering a sense of something that has been particularly hard to grasp over the past two years: togetherness. Other organisations will hold their massive Christmas lunches as takeaway affairs, albeit still with plenty of colour and movement, but Owen is delighted this year’s street party (or picnic) can go ahead. Last year’s event was cancelled due to Sydney’s Northern Beaches outbreak. “We’ve been told by our governments to go and have a family Christmas,” he says. “This is family Christmas for so many people who are going to wake up with no one else in their lives except us.” But there are still Covid considerations. Despite the many volunteers in isolation, Owen says there are plenty of eager helpers on the “reserves bench” – who will be fully vaccinated and wearing PPE. Covid marshals will be in place as the day rolls through the Christmas chapel service with a street choir, Santa’s visit, and into a lunch “with all the trimmings”. Owen insists that the event is more important than ever. “The common refrain is, ‘I don’t know what would have happened to me if I hadn’t been able to come here today’,” he says. “That’s not said in a flippant way. They look me in the eyes with a sense of depth and clarity. It gives you pause in the midst of all the chaos.” Across Sydney in Ashfield, the Rev Bill Crews will be spending his 50th Christmas Day with the poor and disadvantaged. His foundation’s Christmas lunch will be takeaway – but they’re expecting to pump out as many as 3,000 meals across the day. “People are crying out for community now, we’ve been so isolated,” says Crews. “You see a crowd and you kind of get a bit nervous. There’s going to be this need in all of us to get together.” Wayside Chapel’s message is all about love, and Crews expresses a similar sentiment when talking about the importance of his foundation’s Christmas lunch. The last census found there were 16,427 people across the country without a safe, secure place to sleep at night and Owen notes with distress recent food bank research noting many Australians are experiencing food insecurity. This reality only becomes more stark at Christmas. The Salvation Army said in a report released in 2018 that about 15.5% of Australian adults were likely to contact a charity for help with basic necessities such as food, power or other bills at Christmas. “This is a challenging time of the year for people,” says Chris Middendorp, the manager of client services at Sacred Heart Central in the Melbourne suburb of St Kilda. The Sacred Heart Mission Christmas lunch has been running about 40 years, says Middendorp and, like Crews’ operation in Sydney, it will be takeaway again this year. The charity is expecting to serve about 400 lunches of roast, or mushroom wellington for vegetarians, and Christmas pudding. Most who will come for lunch will be experiencing homelessness or struggling financially and are local to the area, which is known for its stark economic divide between the wealthy and disadvantaged. They’ll take their Christmas lunches to the park next door to dine together, or back to rooming houses, or nearby public housing, Middendorp says. “It’s not just about the food of course,” says Middendorp. “A lot of the people we work with are experiencing disadvantage. They don’t have as positive an experience of the community as the rest of us. It’s good to have a place of non-judgment.” Crews has a similar message: “Many come here feeling left out, isolated, not cared for by society. I hope they leave here feeling, ‘I am part of society and I am loved for who I am, just as I am.’” Owen uses a broader term when asks who’ll be coming around for Christmas lunch. It applies to the volunteers, as well as those being served lunch. “We invite everyone to come and celebrate with us who has a hole in their heart,” he says. “I’ve got a whole bunch of volunteers who over the past few years have lost children, and they say, ‘I cannot bear the thought of sitting at home staring at an empty chair at our Christmas table, with a hole in my heart.’ “[They say,] ‘I’d rather take that love that’s been robbed from me and give it to people who desperately need it.’”",News/Australia news,Pudding and PPE: community groups put Covid-safe Christmas cheer on the menu for Australians in need,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/25/pudding-and-ppe-community-groups-put-covid-safe-christmas-cheer-on-the-menu-for-australians-in-need
12/25/2021,"Grace Mirabella, the editor of American Vogue throughout the 1970s and much of the 1980s, has died aged 92. Mirabella was a non-nonsense champion of practical fashion. She succeed the more whimsical and bohemian Diana Vreeland as editor in 1971 and remained in the role until 1988.  A native of New Jersey and an economics graduate, she began her career at the New York department store Macys before joining the publicity department at Saks Fifth Avenue. Mirabella set about reining in Vreeland’s fashion fantasy, and ascribed her loyalties to a new generation of working women who wanted to put careers and financial independence first. “I’m a firm believer that the key to dressing well, the key to style, is that you don’t have to reinvent yourself every day,” Mirabella once said. Her ambition, she wrote in her autobiography In and Out of Vogue was to no longer “showcase women who had no other credit to their names but their names”. “I wanted to give Vogue back to real women … I wanted to give Vogue over to women who were journalists, writers, actresses, artists, playwrights, businesswomen,” she continued. Under her tenure the magazine grew in circulation threefold. But by the 1980s, Mirabella felt, and was perceived as, out of step with the times. “The 1980s just were not my era,” she wrote in her autobiography “I couldn’t stand the frills and the glitz and the $40,000 ball gowns.” Clothes in the 1980s, she added, “were about labels, designers were about being celebrities, and it was all, on a bigger and bigger scale, about money” and fashion had turned “into a self-reverential game full of jokes and pastiches that amused the fashion community enormously and did nothing at all for the woman shopping and trying to find something to wear”, In 1988, owner Condé Nast replaced Mirabella at Vogue with Anna Wintour, who remains in the title role. “Grace guided Vogue through a momentous time in American history – emancipation, sexual freedom, and vital and hard-won rights for women,” Wintour said in tribute Friday. “She eschewed fantasy and escapism in favor of a style that was chicly minimalist and which spoke clearly and directly to the newly liberated ways we wanted to live.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,"Grace Mirabella, 70s and 80s US Vogue editor, dies aged 92",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/dec/24/grace-mirabella-us-vogue-editor-dies-aged-92
12/25/2021,"It has been one of the paradoxes of the year: as TV viewers continue to hunger for updates on the pandemic – the biggest story since the second world war – a slew of broadcasting giants have bade farewell to their regular news slots. On Thursday night, perhaps the biggest of them all, Jon Snow, signed off on his last ever appearance as the face of Channel 4 News, just days after the last ever Andrew Marr Show went out on the BBC.  At Sky News, Adam Boulton has slipped away in a somewhat quieter manner after more than 30 years, a departure that he has linked to what he described as the need for “baby boomers” like himself to make way for new faces on screen. With other 2021 retirements of longstanding regional news figures – Fred Dineage (79) at ITV Meridian and Stewart White at BBC Look East – and impending reshuffles of much younger figures elsewhere, itis not surprising that media watchers view the present moment as a changing of the guard. Factors ranging from 24-hour news, the loss of prestige on the part of evening flagship programmes, the rise of the internet and a push for greater diversity have all been linked to an apparent end of the age of the news anchor as a household name. Ben Abbotts, a communications consultant, cautioned it may yet be premature to bring down the curtain on that age. “There’s that debate but one only has to consider the very high profile of anchors like Fiona Bruce, for example, to realise that there are still particular figures and faces that are hugely important,” he said. Yet – perhaps echoing a feeling felt by many who watched Snow’s farewell – Abbotts also evoked a sense of mourning. “As a long-term devotee of the news since, oh, John Craven’s day on Newsround, I struggle with this loss of the greats. I grew up listening to the vastly experienced Dimbleby – either of them – I relished the familiar Northern Irish lilt of John Cole, the BBC’s political editor of the time, and spent time when I was younger working on Channel 4 News under Jon Snow,” he wrote in a blog for Haggie Partners, where he is a director. Another media commentator, Raymond Snoddy, suggested that the departure of Marr, Boulton and Snow left Andrew Neil “sort of” as “only one of the big male beasts standing” – although the future of Neil is unclear after his parting of ways with GB News. Snoddy, looking back at 2021 in a blog, added: “There are many women of substance in broadcasting not least Emily Maitlis of Newsnight, Kay Burley of Sky News and Susanna Reid of Good Morning Britain, who all know how to skewer a dissembling minister. But it still feels a bit like a changing of the guard, or at least the old male guard.” He also singled out Ros Atkins, a BBC broadcaster sometimes lauded for his ability to navigate the challenges and opportunities of social media. Elsewhere at the BBC, Amol Rajan, Faisal Islam and Chris Mason have all been mentioned as possible replacements for Laura Kuenssberg as political editor. Kuenssberg – already a veteran at the age of 45 – has been singled out as a possible Sunday morning replacement for Marr. Abbotts agreed that she was certainly a runner, but suggested that the BBC’s former North America editor was the odds-on favourite: “I imagine that Jon Sopel is feeling pretty comfortable at the moment.” Meanwhile at Channel 4 News, the shoes (or fluorescent tie) of Snow is regarded a harder – perhaps irreplaceable – act to follow, perhaps even for other stars there such as Cathy Newman, Matt Frei or Krishnan Guru-Murthy. As a Channel 4 News hand who has worked closely with Snow over the years put it: “The next Jon Snow will not be one of the kids in the newsroom who might feel that they are in a position to carry on his legacy, because that legacy is now 750,000 viewers a night. “Broadcast TV just doesn’t hold any sway any more. There’s just nobody coming up now who is going to become a household name just by hosting the evening news. The internet is already creating the next news stars.”",News/Media,Jon Snow’s exit marks the end of an era of TV news big beasts,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/dec/24/jon-snows-exit-marks-the-end-of-an-era-of-tv-news-big-beasts
12/25/2021,"There is that famous photo of Joan Didion, taken in Malibu in 1976, in which she leans on a deck overlooking the beach, cigarette in hand, scotch glass at her elbow, and regards her family – John Dunne, her husband, and their then 10-year-old daughter, Quintana – through lowered, side-long eyes. Like other iconic photos of Didion from the period, she is at one remove from the group, off to the side and in this case, looking not at the camera but at her family as they look at the camera. It’s the pose Didion perfected, in life as in art, and when news of her death at the age of 87 broke on Thursday, it was a shock to see another frame from that sequence surface online. In it, Didion, eyes fixed forward, smiles broadly at the camera in the conventional style – a rare glimpse behind the persona. The paradox of Didion was not unusual among writers, whose confidence is often born of a million anxieties. But her ability to operate outside herself – to measure the gap between inside and out and slyly mock any effort to conceal it – was unparalleled. She was, famously and by her own account, diffident, brittle, runtish, prone to migraines, afraid of the telephone, and as she wrote in the preface to her 1968 collection Slouching Towards Bethlehem, “bad at interviewing people”, apparent deficits that, in Didion’s hands, were of course precisely what permitted her entry to places her rivals – particularly the blow-hard men of 1960s journalism – couldn’t reach.  She was also generous and kind to younger writers. I interviewed her twice at her elegant, sprawling apartment on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, where the doormen referred to her gallantly as “Mrs Dunne”. She wasn’t difficult to interview, but she was a leaver of silences that could unnerve. The second time we met, I brought her biscuits and, handing them over at the door, she looked down at the package as if I’d passed her a rattlesnake. It’s an effect of chain-reading Didion that small moments become overburdened with spurious meaning and, recalling that scene, it seems to me that when she looked back up at me, it was with an expression that indicated, simultaneously, she was touched by the gesture and that, if we were honest, we might also acknowledge it as gaucheness amounting to lunacy. Interpretations of what her elegiac voice meant to the country that made her are best left to the Americans. I just liked her sentences. She is one of the few prose writers I remember whole sections of by heart and they play like old songs. Her line on Joan Baez, written in 1966, remains unseated as a description of what celebrity does to people. (Baez, she wrote, after weeks of observing her, “was a personality before she was entirely a person, and, like anyone to whom that happens, she is in a sense the hapless victim of what others have seen in her”.) I remember the “artificial blue rain” in the opening paragraph of John Wayne: a Love Story as if I myself had been at the Officers’ Club in Colorado Springs in the summer of 1943. The line “the centre was not holding” thumps one as squarely in the chest as it did on first reading. And then there is the Year of Magical Thinking, a piece of writing about the double blow of her husband’s death in 2003, followed 16 months’ later by the death of their daughter. She should not have been able to write about it. The fact that she could, and so soon, still seems outrageous to me and the lesson of that book and her writing in general seems clear; that there was nothing that Didion and by extension we, her readers, could not absorb, fix, stake out the furthest boundaries to. The sense of safety through the horror that came from this skill is a definition of what writing is for. It delivered a comfort amounting to love.",Arts/Books,Remembering Joan Didion: ‘Her ability to operate outside of herself was unparalleled’,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/24/remembering-joan-didion-her-ability-to-operate-outside-of-herself-was-unparalleled
