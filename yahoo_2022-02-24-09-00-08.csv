2/24/2022,"Chinese authorities have confirmed that the high-profile case of a chained woman that was found inside a hut in the eastern Jiangsu Province was trafficked multiple times.

After weeks of public outrage and requests for a thorough investigation, the chained Chinese woman seen in a viral video, whose real name has now been identified as Xiao Huamei, was found to have been trafficked from Yagu village in Yunnan Province.

Xiao, who was born in 1977, was married in 1995 and later divorced in 1997 before a woman, identified as Sang, brought her to Jiangsu Province to supposedly help her seek medical treatment and find her a new husband; however, Sang tricked and sold her to a man in Donghai County for 5,000 yuan (approximately $790) in 1998, according to ABC News.

The Jiangsu provincial authorities stated that Sang and her husband had previously been convicted in 2000 for trafficking girls. They were both arrested again on Tuesday.

While this chain of events is still under investigation, Xiao was apparently sold again to a construction foreman by another couple in Henan province who found her “wandering as a beggar,” according to a report reviewed by ABC News. The foreman sold Xiao to a man in Feng County, who then sold her to Mr. Dong before she was found chained around the neck by a vlogger who visited the Huankou village in Xuzhou City, Jiangsu Province.

Police have also detained the human traffickers who sold her in Feng County. Mr. Dong, was also arrested on charges of abuse on Thursday.

Dong reportedly took out a marriage license in June 1998 on which he falsified Xiao’s birthdate.

After the video of her uploaded by a vlogger went viral, it was reported that Xiao had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and was taken to a hospital for treatment.

Chinese authorities reportedly fired eight lower-level Communist Party officials, while three were “deprived of freedom of movement” due to an internal party investigation that highlighted their failure to protect public rights and for issuing false information, according to ABC News. Six other officials have also reportedly received internal punishments.

2/24/2022,"By Tom Sims FRANKFURT, Feb 21 (Reuters) - While Ukraine's airspace has been largely empty amid the crisis with Russia, a remotely piloted U.S. military vehicle called the RQ-4 Global Hawk has flown over the country in circles for hours at a time. Over the past month, two of the spy planes have travelled on regular missions from the Mediterranean Sea to Ukraine, where they have navigated in repeated loops in the north and the east, according to Flightradar24. The drones' high-altitude, long-distance flights have coincided with a military build-up by Russia along the Ukrainian border and a flurry of diplomacy among leaders of the United States, Europe and Russia to avert war. At times, the two planes - under the call signs Forte10, Forte11 and Forte12 - have been the only active aircraft publicly visible over eastern Ukraine. Aviation watchers have taken note, speculating that the United States is making its presence known in a show of force. ""With these types of flights, leaving the transponder on is a conscious decision,"" said Ian Petchenik, communications director at Flightradar24. The U.S. Air Force declined to comment on the details of the flights but said the United States routinely operates aircraft in support of intelligence objectives. ""These missions demonstrate our continued commitment to safety and security in the region,"" a spokesperson said. On Monday evening, Forte11 returned to the Mediterranean after a nearly 24-hour trip over Ukraine. Its transponder went off at a low altitude near the Sigonella Naval Air Station in Sicily. It was the 13th similar mission. According to the Air Force's website, the mission of such aircraft is to collect intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance ""to support joint combatant forces in worldwide peacetime, contingency and wartime operations."" Their manufacturer, Northrop Grumman, says the planes see ""potential threats"" and ""gather near-real-time, high-resolution imagery of large areas of land in all types of weather – day or night."" The flight path has stood out because international commercial aviation, out of an abundance of caution, has largely avoided Ukraine airspace, especially in the east along the Russian border. On Feb. 15, Flightradar24 said https://twitter.com/flightradar24/status/1493693171007696900?s=20&t=3dWyN6x7vqDgMzPm-m6ZMwForte11 was its most tracked flight, and then later reported that it had been airborne for more than 21 hours https://twitter.com/flightradar24/status/1493931517772537864?s=20&t=3dWyN6x7vqDgMzPm-m6ZMw. The aircraft, with a wingspan of nearly 40 meters and length of 15 meters, can typically fly more than 30 hours. In 2014, the craft travelled 34.3 hours without refuelling to set a record for the U.S. Air Force, according to its website. Northrop Grumman has been providing the aircraft to the USAF for 20 years. In August, it won a five-year contract to maintain the craft for NATO.
