4/27/2022,"The EU executive has proposed measures to protect journalists and campaigners working to expose corruption and wrongdoing from vexatious lawsuits. In the first proposal of its kind in Europe, the European Commission is targeting so-called “strategic lawsuits against public participation”, or Slapps, where wealthy individuals and companies attempt to use the law to intimidate or silence investigative reporters and non-governmental organisations. Under a draft EU directive, journalists and NGOs in the EU would be able to appeal to the courts to throw out “manifestly unfounded” court cases that involve more than one EU member state. And in a move against London – often called the libel capital of Europe – courts in member states would be able to refuse to recognise or enforce judgments in Slapp cases from non-EU countries. EU officials say they only have the legal powers to act in cross-border cases and believe they can close down “forum shopping”, where wealthy clients seek the friendliest legal regime to pursue their critics in the courts. But in a separate non-binding recommendation, the commission is also urging member states to crack down on vexatious court cases without a cross-border element, the most common form of abusive litigation. Abusive litigation has mushroomed in Europe in recent years, prompting warnings from human rights experts of a growing threat to freedom of expression and perversion of the justice system and rule of law. When the Maltese investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia was murdered in 2017, she was battling 47 lawsuits from an array of business people and politicians, including cases involving London lawyers. Her eldest son, Matthew Caruana Galizia, an investigative journalist who has led a pan-European campaign against abusive lawsuits, said Slapps had made his mother’s life “a living hell”. “Slapp cases really wreck people’s lives. They destroy careers and they destroy lives. It was like that for my mother. And it’s like that for many other journalists,” he told the Guardian. Last year the Italian crime reporter Cesare Giuzzi of Corriere della Sera announced he was giving up speaking at public events, saying he had been sued more than 50 times by members of organised crime gangs, their relatives, politicians, police and business people. Writing on Facebook, he said no judge had ever found against him but he was exhausted with fighting unjust allegations because of what he said at public events. Campaign groups have also been targeted by abusive lawsuits: since 2015 there have been 42 cases brought in the EU against human rights defenders, including those seeking to protect the environment. The European Commission vice-president Vĕra Jourová said: “These litigations are normally started by powerful and wealthy people, against those who obviously do not have such a financial buffer.” She said freelance journalists and those working for smaller publications faced “an incredible problem” with such litigation. “This law should discourage everybody [in the EU] to go to London for such remedy,” she said, adding that court proceedings in the UK happened very frequently. She said there needed to be further discussions on “how to have better guarantees that the abusive litigations will not continue on the UK territory, turning against the European Union journalists and human rights defenders”. Under the EU proposals, if a case is dismissed as abusive, claimants will have to bear their costs and targets of legal action can claim damages. Matthew Caruana Galizia said the commission had done the “maximum possible” within the framework of EU law. “My family, we’re happy to call it Daphne’s law. Because we think that this is what it is,” he said. “When it comes to transposition, that will be the opportunity, I think, to cover more kinds of cases other than cross border cases. So we’ll then have to continue the campaign at member state level.” Diana Riba i Giner, a Catalan separatist MEP and member of the European parliament’s civil liberties committee, said the commission had not gone far enough, because its legal proposal focused on cross-border cases, not domestic ones, and civil law, rather than criminal cases. “Loopholes will continue to allow attacks against journalists, civil society and all those who are defending democracy,” she said. Flutura Kusari, a legal adviser at the European Centre for Press and Media Freedom, said the EU proposals were a historic development. “We have seen that Slapps destroy careers and lives. Today is the first step in creating serious obstacles to those hoping to use Slapps to censor journalists and to hide the truth.” She said the proposals should be seen as a minimum standard for member states. While she regretted the UK was no longer an EU member state, she hoped to influence UK law through a future Council of Europe recommendation against Slapps. The UK government last month promised legal reforms to discourage vexatious legal action by oligarchs and powerful companies. Kusari said she was optimistic about the British government’s plans. “They can no longer stay silent and close their ears and eyes on the impact of Slapps on journalism.”",News/Media,EU announces plans to protect journalists from vexatious lawsuits,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/27/eu-announces-plans-protect-journalists-vexatious-lawsuits-anti-slapp
4/27/2022,"Amanda Serrano is on top of the world – that’s how it feels, anyway, standing on the 86th-floor observation deck of the Empire State Building on a misty Tuesday afternoon. As the seven-division champion from Brooklyn’s Bushwick neighbourhood poses for photographs, the city unspools behind her, offering an evocative glimpse of Madison Square Garden. In the storied venue’s 140 years of hosting boxing, a women’s fight has never headlined a card – until Saturday night, when Serrano will climb through the ropes to challenge Ireland’s Katie Taylor for the undisputed lightweight championship. The fight has been billed as the biggest in women’s boxing history – perhaps in recent boxing history, period. Serrano and Taylor are the world’s top two female boxers regardless of weight. The last time the pound-for-pound No 1 and No 2 squared off was more than a decade ago when Manny Pacquiao defeated Juan Manuel Márquez by split decision in 2008. Such a long-awaited showdown marks an unparalleled height in Serrano’s already lofty career. “It means everything, you know, I worked so hard,” Serrano told the Guardian. “And I couldn’t ask for a better partner than Katie Taylor – she’s well-deserving, she’s an Olympic gold medalist and undisputed champion. You have pound-for-pound No 1, No 2, going at it. I’m excited to see who’s the best.” At 33, Serrano has achieved nearly everything a fighter could hope for. With a professional record of 42-1-1, the heavy-handed southpaw has captured nine major world titles across every weight from 115lbs to 140 lbs. Only Pacquiao, an eight-division champion, held belts in more. Serrano’s 30 career knockouts is thought to be second in women’s boxing history to Christy Martin’s 32. Yet Serrano has spent most of that decorated career unknown to all but hardcore boxing fans, pushed to the shadows by the same obstacles facing countless other female fighters. “Getting promoters, getting networks wanting to promote us and take chances with us, it was unheard of,” Serrano said. “People didn’t want to help us.” Routinely, a woman fighter might make a few thousand dollars where – with comparable accolades, for a comparable matchup – a man netted nearly a million. That has led many female boxers to pivot to mixed martial arts, which boasted superior parity in both pay and promotion. Serrano herself made the switch temporarily, starting with a draw in 2018 then winning twice in a row – including once by submission – before returning to the boxing ring. The debut of women’s boxing in the Olympics in 2012 was a major boon for female fighters, the world stage offering newfound visibility and respect – winning gold in London in the lightweight event, Taylor emerged as an immediate star. Serrano, however, had turned professional three years prior, so was unable to compete under the sport’s then-amateur requirement, which remained in place until 2016. That has all changed in recent years as promoters have started to throw their weight behind female boxers, none more than Matchroom’s Eddie Hearn, who promotes Taylor. “Katie Taylor, she made sure Eddie Hearn put her on DAZN, so that was an opener,” Serrano said. “And we had more of that … we had Showtime putting women on, and Top Rank and all these promoters starting to play women little by little. A lot more people support women, are going out there.“ Serrano’s promotional boost came from a less traditional benefactor. An improbable partnership with internet-provocateur-turned-boxer Jake Paul has led to a new chapter in Serrano’s career. In September, she became the first – and so far only – fighter to sign with Paul’s nascent Most Valuable Promotions. The two first crossed paths in January 2020, when they happened to fight on the same card in Miami: Serrano knocking out Simone da Silva in round three, Paul also winning by stoppage in his first-ever professional bout against the YouTuber AnEsonGib. Then in August 2021, still undefeated after several fights but looking to gain legitimacy among boxing’s skeptics, Paul invited Serrano to share a card in Cleveland – where she convincingly defended her unified featherweight titles against Yamileth Mercado. A few weeks later, she became the company’s first signee. “Working with Jake Paul has been a great help,” Serrano said. “Not just for me, but for boxing and women in general. Now people know who I am, more are wanting to tune in to see what else women’s boxing has for the future.” Although the pairing may seem strange – hyper-focused Serrano doesn’t date, drink, or own a cell phone, while the extremely online Paul puts the “social” and “media” in social media – they have proven a powerful complement. Serrano lends Paul credibility as an athlete and casts him in a new, benevolent light as a champion for women in sport.Meanwhile, he has helped elevate her profile beyond boxing circles and given her unprecedented leverage in securing fights such as this one. Paul assessed Serrano’s social media presence and gave her targeted ways to amplify her brand: what and when to post, how to engage online with fans, getting professional photographs taken. Her Instagram and Twitter following have swelled. “It’s definitely a big help,” Serrano said. “Now I got Jake Paul behind me and promoting me, shining that light and writing about me on social media and giving me that push.” It has paid off. Along with the history and the glory, this will be the first seven-figure purse of Serrano’s career. Then there is the fight itself, which was initially made for May 2020 but scuppered due to the pandemic. It is somehow bigger now. The 35-year-old Taylor, who has unified all four major title belts at 135lbs, has only consolidated her place atop the sport’s pound-for-pound list. But Serrano, who was born in Puerto Rico and now lives in New York, enters with an even deeper, more extensive resume – and will no doubt enjoy hometown advantage. “I just got to stick to the game plan and listen to my corner, and make sure that I go out there, do and be Amanda Serrano. And that’s how I secure the victory. Katie, she’s Katie Taylor, but you know, styles make fights, she might come a different way when she gets punched in the face fighting me.” On Saturday, we’ll see the biggest women’s bout ever. And what does Serrano hope for out of it? Beyond a victory, beyond becoming the first Puerto Rican unified champion regardless of gender, Serrano hopes that viewers come away from the contest knowing one thing: “That women can fight. That we can sell tickets – the Garden’s almost sold out. I mean, it’s incredible to see that. And that was definitely my goal for the newer generation of females in the sport. I never thought that I would be able to see this, but I’m seeing it, and I just hope this is not the end.”",Sport/Sport,Amanda Serrano ready for crowning glory in historic duel with Taylor,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/27/amanda-serrano-ready-for-crowning-glory-in-historic-duel-katie-taylor
4/27/2022,"Russia’s defence ministry said its Kalibr missiles had struck an arms depot in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region housing weapons from the US and European countries. Russian forces have established control over the settlement of Zarichne after storming the settlement of Yampil, the Ukrainian military has said. Russian forces were again attacking the huge Azovstal steel plant where fighters and some civilians are holed up in the southern city of Mariupol, an aide to the city’s mayor said. A series of blasts sounded across in the Russian city of Belgorod near the Ukrainian border early Wednesday morning as authorities extinguished a fire at an ammunition depot. Regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said he woke “to a loud sound like an explosion” at about 3​:​.35am in an update posted to Telegram. Firefighters tackled a blaze at a railway substation in the southwestern Ukrainian town of Krasne on Monday, after Russian missiles hit targets aimed at disrupting weapons supplies to Ukraine’s forces in the east: Ukrainian soldiers fired grad rockets at Russian positions in Luhansk region, in the Donbas, on Tuesday: Russian efforts to take the Azovstal iron and steelworks steelworks – the last remaining Ukrainian stronghold in the besieged city – have been stymied by a fierce resistance and the difficulties of operating in the industrial area. A few thousand vastly outnumbered Ukrainian forces have formed a stubborn pocket of resistance in the works – a sprawling mass of tunnels and workshops spread over four square miles. On 21 April, Vladimir Putin ordered his forces not to storm the works, and officials in the city accused Russia of burying thousands of civilians in the nearby town of Manhush. Satellite images appeared to support the claims: Drone footage released on 19 April showed a large plume of smoke rising from the steelworks: Under Russian control Russian invasion route Russian airstrike or shelling Russian attack or movement Ukrainian attack or movement  The world becomes increasingly concerned about more than 100,000 Russian troops that have accumulated on the Ukrainian border. Western intelligence agencies sound the alarm, though Vladimir Putin insists Russia has no plans to invade. On 22 February, Putin declared that Russia would recognise the Luhansk and Donetsk regions as independent states, after Russia-backed separatists partially seized the regions. Ukraine and the west's worst fears are realised as airstrikes hit targets across the country, as far west as Lviv. By clicking on the dots on the map, you'll reveal more information about individual strikes and events. Russian forces invade Ukraine from multiple entry points: Belarus to the north, Russia to the east and Russian-occupied Crimea to the south. Russian forces move on several points on the first day of the invasion. Several key locations, including the Chernobyl exclusion zone, are captured by the Russian army. Russian troops enter parts of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, where they face strong resistance. After fierce fighting prevents them from seizing the Hostomel airbase on the first day of the invasion, progress is limited to the north-west of the capital. They are still, however, able to claim some land on the outskirts of the city. Elsewhere, fighting continues even as Russian progress slows. Russian forces move to encircle the southern city of Mariupol, although they enjoy less success in the north, where they abandon an attempt to take Chernihiv after heavy fighting. Russian forces advance on key cities including Kharkiv in the north-east, Kyiv in the north and Mariupol in the south. A large convoy of military vehicles approaches the capital, although progress is limited and logistical problems are reported. As the war enters its second week, Russia steps up shelling of civilian areas. Operations to envelop Kyiv remain the focus of Russia’s efforts, but the ISW reports three other aims: seizing Kharkiv, taking Mariupol and securing a “land bridge” in the south, and securing Kherson in order to set conditions for a drive west towards Mykolaiv and Odesa. Little progress is made over the first two weeks of March. Amid reports of lost momentum and low morale, Russian forces are consolidating positions with reinforcements and probing defences around Kyiv. Dozens of civilians are reportedly killed as Russian forces hit cities with artillery and airstrikes, seen as a new tactic in the face of limited advances on the ground. Russia is widely seen as making its best advances in the south, where Kherson becomes the first major city to fall under Russian control. On the other southern front, several buildings in Mariupol are flattened and people are left without water or power. Russia breaks ceasefires put in place to allow for evacuations from Mariupol and Volnovakha. As the conflict concludes its third week, Russia sends in reinforcements to tighten its grip around the key cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol, which remain under Ukrainian control. Russian advances in the south contrast with difficulties its forces have faced in the north and north-east. Nowhere is this resistance stronger than in the increasingly fortified capital, Kyiv. Russia steps up its artillery and airstrikes on the city in an apparent attempt to degrade defending forces' capacity and morale. It is a strategy that has so far failed in other cities such as Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol. In the months before its invasion Russia had deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/russias-war-in-ukraine-complete-guide-in-maps-video-and-pictures
4/27/2022,"A museum is appealing for old bottles of drinks marketed to women, such as Babycham and Cherry B, to help it recreate a once treasured pub from the 1960s. The Black Country Living Museum in Dudley is calling out for donations of furnishings and objects as it sets about building a recreation of the now demolished Elephant and Castle pub that stood in nearby Wolverhampton. The museum’s collections team are looking for bar items from the 1960s, in particular items tailored for the female market such as Babycham, Cherry B and Golden Godwin. “The pub is going to be set in the 60s, which was a time when lots of women were starting to go to the pub and have a drink, and brands were targeting alcohol to women for the first time,” said Chloe Taylor, a collections manager at the 26-acre open-air museum. “We want to be able to tell the story of everyone who drank at the pub. We specifically selected the Elephant and Castle as we know that people from all over the world would drink in there, particularly people that migrated here to work, so it allows us to tell a really diverse range of stories.” The recreation of the building is almost complete, with a local company reproducing the famous elephant statue that once stood prominently on the pub’s exterior, and staff are now looking for objects to fill its interior. As well as drinks bottles, the museum is also looking for promotional materials such as wall plaques, mirrors and coasters, as well as wooden tables and dark mahogany spindle back chairs, beer, wines and spirits bottles and promotional glasses. Built in 1905, the Elephant and Castle became a Wolverhampton landmark and was frequented by a diverse clientele over the years, including Irish and Commonwealth citizens from India, Pakistan and the Caribbean. Typical of its era, it had a public bar for the working classes and a separate smoking room with slightly higher prices for the middle classes. It was demolished unexpectedly in 2001, shortly before it could be considered for listing, dismaying local residents. “It was such a well-loved and treasured venue in Wolverhampton and that’s why we’re working so hard to create a really authentic recreation of the building, because there’s very little of the original that survived the demolition,” Taylor said. “We’re really relying on people’s stories and memories and oral histories to recreate the pub, which is one of the reasons why we’re so keen to work with the public to collect objects to go inside.” The pub is part of a major development at the site in which 22 historic buildings will be recreated and the museum’s size will be increased by a third, focusing on the 1940s-60s.",Arts/Culture,BYO Babycham?

4/27/2022,"The director general of the BBC has described sexual misconduct claims made against the former Radio 1 DJ Tim Westwood as “appalling”, and urged anyone with evidence to come forward. Tim Davie, who was head of radio output at the BBC when Westwood was the voice of rap and hip-hop on Radio 1, called the allegations “shocking”, but said he had seen no evidence of complaints being made against the DJ at the BBC. On Wednesday two venues cancelled scheduled appearances by Westwood, after a number of women accused him of misusing his position in the music industry to take advantage of them, following a joint investigation into the former BBC Radio 1 DJ by the Guardian and BBC. Westwood has strenuously denied all the allegations. A spokesperson said the claims were completely false and denied in their entirety. Davie said: “It is shocking and the testimony of the women is powerful and appalling. I credit the BBC and Guardian teams for going after the story.” Asked whether the BBC had any records of formal complaints about Westwood, he said: “I’ve seen no evidence of complaints. I’ve asked and we looked at our records and we’ve seen no evidence. “Every complaint has to be taken seriously. If anything comes up we will investigate it fully. If people have evidence where things weren’t followed up or they have concern in this area bring it to us … we will follow up anything and we will dig and dig and dig. If people have got evidence of wrongdoing we need to bring it forward.” Davie added that there was “nothing worse in life” than abuse of power. “It’s about values, setting the right culture and putting leaders in place. It’s completely unacceptable,” he said. Global Radio is coming under pressure to respond to the allegations of sexual misconduct made about Westwood, after three women accused the DJ of opportunistic and predatory sexual behaviour, while four others allege they were groped by him at events. The earliest alleged incident took place in 1992; the most recent in 2017. The women were in their late teens or early 20s when the incidents happened, they say. The Guardian approached Global, the parent company of Capital Xtra on Tuesday but 24 hours after the allegations surfaced the company had made no comment. It has not said if the DJ’s regular Saturday night show will go ahead as scheduled this Saturday. Westwood was due to play at the Rum Rum nightclub in Birmingham on 1 May but the event has been cancelled, as has an appearance the DJ was scheduled to make at Butlins in Bognor Regis. The UK hip-hop pioneer Cookie Pryce, a former member of the Cookie Crew and now a music industry executive, called on Global Radio to suspend Westwood while an investigation into the DJ’s behaviour was carried out. “The horrific allegations that have surfaced means [Westwood] has questions to answer and he should be investigated,” she said. “[Global] should be investigating him. And they [Global] should be investigated.” She said it was time for a “fair and open” conversation about Westwood’s standing in black music and culture. “Our culture, our music, our creativity, everything about us, has been appropriated for generations, and I just think people are very, very, tired.

4/27/2022,"Few people in the west doubt that Ukraine is fighting a just war. Russia’s invasion was entirely unprovoked. Whatever complaints it may have had about Nato expansion or Ukraine’s mistreatment of Russians in Donbas, nobody had attacked Russia, and nobody was planning to. Vladimir Putin launched a straightforward war of aggression and territorial conquest. It follows that supporting Ukraine is the right thing to do. But it is not at all clear that the kind of support we are giving (and not giving) is the right way to go about preserving the Ukrainian nation. The longer this war rages on, the more Ukrainians will flee their homeland, and the more devastation will be wrought upon their homes, cities, industry and economy. Yet the west’s current approach of supporting Ukraine’s war aim of defeating the aggressor, and providing arms for that purpose while pointedly avoiding direct military intervention, is guaranteed to prolong the war. Russia’s progress may be slowed, but it’s highly unlikely to be stopped, far less pushed out of Ukraine, and in the meantime the grinding destruction and hideous war crimes will continue. No day goes past without some senior western politician proclaiming that Ukraine will be “successful” and that Russia is “failing”. This is certainly morale-boosting. But it is clearly nonsense. The fact is, day by day, more towns and cities are destroyed and then fall to the Russians. In two months, the area under Russian control – originally just the breakaway parts of Donbas – has grown to perhaps five times the size. If Russia continues to suffer “defeats” at this pace, then in another two months the entire south of Ukraine will be in ruins, cities such as Odesa will resemble Mariupol, and thousands upon thousands more Ukrainians will have died. Worse, as the war goes on, and more towns are destroyed, it becomes less likely that Ukrainians who have fled to other countries will ever return, because they will have no homes or workplaces to come back to. How many citizens of Mariupol will ever return? If Russia’s aim was to exterminate the Ukrainian nation, then the west’s approach is helping to do just that. Surely, if the lives of Ukrainian people are our concern then the west has to do something to stop the war – now. Encouraging the Ukrainians to continue, however just their cause, is merely making their country uninhabitable. The trouble is, there are only two ways to stop the war quickly, and neither is palatable to most western leaders. One would be for Nato to enter the war and make a quick, massive and decisive strike to cripple Russia’s invasion forces. Unlike with Russia’s actions, it would have every right under international law to do so. When Putin intervened in Syria, he very carefully framed this as a response to a request from Syria’s legitimate and internationally recognised government. The west could do the same in Ukraine. Putin himself has no such justification for his invasion. The risk involved in this – of a third world war – is obvious, and it’s why the west refuses to intervene directly. The other option is to persuade Putin to implement an immediate ceasefire, by inviting Russia to comprehensive peace talks. Western leaders are disinclined to parley with a butcher such as Putin. But they did it with Serbia’s Slobodan Milošević, only months after the massacre at Srebrenica, and the result was the Dayton agreement that put an end to the war in Bosnia in 1995. To get Putin to the negotiating table at all, everything would have to be up for discussion – including Ukraine’s borders, Russia’s age-old security concerns, perhaps even the very logic of basing today’s international frontiers in that part of Europe on what were internal borders in the USSR, drawn up by communist leaders precisely to prevent Soviet republics and regions from being viable independent states. The outcome of the talks does not need to be predetermined. The important thing is to talk rather than fight. Western leaders cannot bring themselves to broach these matters, which would seem to reward Putin for attempting to redraw the map by force. They would rather fight – or more accurately, let Ukraine fight, in the hope of defeating Russia. But if one thing is certain it is that Putin will never accept defeat. He is already too deeply invested in this war to back off with nothing to show for it. If western leaders think that their arms-length encouragement of Ukraine will bring about a Ukrainian military victory, then they are fatally misreading Putin’s intentions and resolve. For Ukraine’s sake, we need to stop him now, one way or the other, before nothing is left of the country we want to protect.

4/27/2022,"For all their polymath complexity, all their melding of artistic and cinematic and technical achievements, timeless video games sometimes boil down to one very good idea. In 2006 Wii Sports’ idea was this: wouldn’t it be fun to wave a controller around like a tennis racquet? That’s it. That’s the game. But man, it’s so entertaining. Wii Sports sparked a brief obsession with motion-control video games in the late 00s that has since died out again, but now that we’ve all had a break from flinging our limbs around in front of a console, I’m glad it’s back again. Nintendo Switch Sports brings that idea to a new wave of families. Snapping off the Joy-Con controllers, you hand one to another person and compete in one of six simple sports: tennis, badminton, volleyball, bowling, football and swordfighting. That last one is Nintendo’s own invention, called chambara, in which two opponents wield wooden swords at each other and try to knock each other off a raised platform into a swimming pool. If you’ve got extra Joy-Cons, you can play some sports with four players; if you’re solo, you can compete online to win glory and cute outfits for your adorably androgynous character. But playing alone robs you of slapstick comedy moments such as watching your partner hit the wall with a wild badminton swing and swear loudly in front of your children, which for me is rather the point. Football is the most complicated of the lot, getting you to chase a giant ball around the pitch with the control stick and kick it by swinging your arm (or, in one mode, by strapping the controller to your thigh and actually kicking). The rest are played by waving the controller around and pressing maybe one or two buttons. Bowling, especially, is intuitive enough for a five-year-old or an 85-year-old to pick up quickly and enjoy within seconds, and that’s the genius of it. I wasn’t blown away by the subtlety of the simulated movements in-game – beyond adding a bit of spin to a tennis or bowling ball, it’s mostly about waving your arm at the right moment – but it doesn’t matter that it’s not 100% accurate. It’s fun. Nintendo Switch Sports effortlessly entertained my family and a friend’s family for an entire afternoon, and it’s the kind of thing you’ll bust out for an hour here and there for years to come when people visit. It’s just so welcoming, a quality I especially value in a game. One thing to bear in mind is that you can’t play with a friend unless you connect the Switch to a TV, which puts the kibosh on spontaneous pub tennis matches or office sword fights – probably for the best, if we’re honest, as enthusiastic movements sent a Joy-Con flying off in an unexpected direction twice in the time I’ve been playing this for review. If you want your windows and TV screens to remain unbroken, use the controller straps to be safe. Volleyball is the only truly boring sport of this bunch – the pace is slow and the movements too obvious – and football has the most longevity, a kind of lighter take on Rocket League. But I reckon it’s the old standbys of tennis and bowling that will be brought out time and time again – and perhaps badminton, which works exactly like tennis but is more forgiving to beginners (and children). None of these sports would be enough to sustain a game alone, but together, and paired with Nintendo’s charming and slick aesthetic and brain-infesting music, they are the makings of a good time.

4/27/2022,"Elon Musk has engaged with tweets criticising Twitter employees despite promising not to “disparage” the company or its representatives while he completes the deal to acquire the social media platform. The world’s richest man agreed to restrictions on his tweets as part of a 95-page agreement covering his $44bn acquisition filed on Tuesday. However, a day after signing the agreement, which was published on the website of the US securities regulator, Musk responded to tweets from two political commentators that criticised Twitter staff. Musk replied on Tuesday night to a Twitter post from the podcast host Saagar Enjeti flagging an article claiming Twitter’s legal head, Vijaya Gadde, had become “emotional” during a meeting to discuss the deal. In the post, Enjeti referred to Gadde as Twitter’s “top censorship advocate”, in a reference to the company’s decision in 2020 to block sharing of a New York Post story about President Joe Biden’s son Hunter. Musk replied: “Suspending the Twitter account of a major news organisation for publishing a truthful story was obviously incredibly inappropriate.” His intervention triggered negative tweets from users about Gadde, including one quote tweet in response stating that she would “go down in history as an appalling person”, while other posts called for her to lose her job. Musk also replied to a potentially defamatory tweet from the rightwing commentator Mike Cernovich about Twitter’s deputy general counsel, Jim Baker, which referred to Baker’s work in a previous role at the FBI. Replying, Musk wrote: “Sounds pretty bad …” Twitter has been approached for comment. The agreement also stated Musk would have to pay Twitter $1bn if he walks away from the deal. The break clause, a common feature of takeover agreements, would be triggered if the financing for the deal falls apart. Twitter will also have to pay a $1bn fee to the entrepreneur if, for instance, it accepts a higher bid from elsewhere. Musk has put together a $46.5bn funding package for the deal and his own contribution to it has concerned investors in Tesla, who wiped $126bn off the company’s value on Tuesday amid worries that the billionaire may have to sell shares in the electric carmaker to fund his share. Musk is part-funding the Twitter deal with $21bn of his own equity and a further $12.5bn loan secured against his Tesla stake. The document filed with the US financial watchdog also addresses Musk’s penchant for attention-grabbing tweets that are avidly consumed and retweeted by his 86 million followers. The agreement states: “The equity investor shall be permitted to issue tweets about the merger or the transactions contemplated hereby so long as such tweets do not disparage the company or any of its representatives.” According to the US dictionary publisher Merriam-Webster, the legal definition of disparagement is: “the publication of false and injurious statements that are derogatory of another’s property, business, or product”. Hours later, Musk tweeted that Truth Social, Donald Trump’s rival social media platform, was outperforming Twitter and TikTok on the Apple store.

4/27/2022,"Women footballers in Italy’s top flight league are to finally be deemed professional, an “epochal change” that ends years of female players earning capped salaries due to only being recognised as amateur athletes. The Italian Football Federation (FIGC) said the change to the women’s Serie A league would take effect from 1 July, in time for the start of the new season. “Today is a big day,” said Gabriele Gravina, the federation’s president. “We’re the first federation in Italy to put this change into effect”. Umberto Calcagno, who heads up the Italian Footballers’ Association, said the move marked the “start of a new challenge” that will see “the system committed to taking advantage of all the opportunities of this epochal change”. The women’s Serie A was established in 1968 and for the first two decades players were only refunded travel expenses until their squads came under the remit of FIGC’s National Amateur League, meaning the women could earn a capped salary, albeit on contracts that exempted them from contributions to social benefits such as pensions and healthcare. Unlike their multimillion-euro earning male counterparts, currently the gross salary of women playing for Serie A clubs is limited to €30,000 a year. FIGC, which has organised the Serie A women’s league since the 2018-2019 season, began the legal process to upgrade their status after coming under increasing pressure following the national team’s success in qualifying for the 2019 Women’s World Cup after a two-decade drought, and in reaching the tournament’s quarter-finals. “It’s been a long time coming, but finally, it’s happened,” said Elisabetta Vignotto, a celebrated striker who was among Italy’s first female footballers. Vignotto, now 68, played with several clubs in the 1970s and 1980s and was a top scorer for the national side. “There was no salary, we just had our travel expenses refunded,” she said. “It was only towards the end of my career that we got a bit more in reimbursements, and even then we had to rely on good faith.” Sara Gama, captain of Juventus and Italy, said the change would give women’s football “the opportunity for growth from unexplored borders”. Although women’s Serie A has been around in some shape or form for over 50 years, the first top male club to launch an official women’s side was Fiorentina in 2015, following a requirement for all Serie A men’s clubs to have a women’s team. “I played for many clubs because at that time they would only last a year or so due to running out of money,” said Vignotto. The women’s Serie A league currently has 12 clubs, although they will be reduced to 10 from next season.",Sport/Football,Footballers in Italian women’s top division finally turn professional ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/27/footballers-italian-women-top-division-finally-turn-professional
4/27/2022,"The American fast food chain KFC has launched a £198 insulated leather handbag for the British market, designed to be able to hold one of the chicken chain’s Twister Wraps. The “Wrapuette”, inspired by the Baguette bag shape of the 2000s which was popularised by fashion brands such as Fendi, Dior and Gucci, is being sold as a limited edition via KFC’s online shop. According to its website, all proceeds will go to the KFC Foundation which, it says, “supports grassroots non-profit organisations that empower young people across the UK, helping them to fulfil their potential and build a positive future”. The handbag comes in pebbled or textured leather in KFC’s signature tomato red, and features a monochrome image of Colonel Sanders and a Y2K-style set of letter charms spelling KFC. It is lined with an insulating layer to keep food warm. KFC says it is running a waiting list for the bag. A spokesperson for KFC would not reveal the quantity produced, saying “numbers are extremely exclusive for now”. They added that the bag was “made from Italian leather and handcrafted on Savile Row”. “I love it,” said the fashion stylist Natalie Hartley, who has added her name to the waiting list. “It’s so clever. No one would expect KFC to bring out a collectible handbag. “They’ve hit the nail on the head by going for the Y2K trend. The Baguette bag is iconic.” Hartley notes that the bag’s shape is a “bit more street” than that of the original Baguette. The Baguette bag, originally designed by Silvia Venturini Fendi in 1997, was so-called because, wrote Vogue’s Laird Borrelli-Persson in a 2015 retrospective of the It bag: “This petite shoulder bag nestles under the arm as easily as the long, crusty French loaf from which it borrows its name.” Hartley, who runs her own vintage shop, Chillie London, and already owns a KFC bucket hat, is hoping to add the Wrapuette to her collection. Although she wouldn’t sell it immediately, she envisages a strong return on it. Hartley can see the fashion crowd buying it (“They’ll find it ironic”), as well as “all those celebrity kids - unless they’re vegan”. “It’s tapping into that social-media savvy Gen Z cohort,” says Jane Collins, senior editor for footwear and accessories at the trend-forecasting agency WGSN. “It plays into logo mania which was so key for that era, and also the high-low trend with its high price point. It’s going to be on eBay in minutes.”",News/Business,KFC’s £198 Twister holder touted as next It bag – except among vegans,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/27/kfcs-198-twister-holder-touted-as-next-it-bag-except-among-vegans
4/27/2022,"About 15 years ago, I made a little film about a day in the life of a postman. It was an early start. As I helped him sort out his bag, we chatted about football. He was a Chelsea fan. I asked whether he had a season ticket at Stamford Bridge. I will never forget the look he shot me. It was like I had asked what kind of Ferrari he drove. “I can’t afford to go and see Chelsea,” he said. “I’m a postman.” So here we had a football club owned by a fantastically wealthy Russian, which was pricing out a normal working man. Here, before dawn in a sorting office, somewhere in the generous sprawl of south London, this anomaly felt stark. In football, we always have a lexicon of cliches ready to go; I reached for one now as I said to myself: dear God, the game’s gone. This isn’t to blame Roman Abramovich for everything. However ill-gotten his gains may be, he is not directly to blame for the pricing out of many ordinary football supporters by clubs up and down the country. But his entry into the game highlights the fault line at the heart of professional football’s problem: clubs can’t find a way of living within their means. That leads to desperation, which invariably leads to desperate measures. And that entails all manner of desperadoes getting involved. Whether you are into football or not, it won’t have escaped your attention that some of the owners of these football clubs have a certain dodginess about them. Many are morally dubious; others are plain incompetent. Some clubs have owners who are both dodgy and hopeless, a terrible combination indeed. England’s three football authorities – the Premier League, English Football League and Football Association – each have had their own tests for owners and directors. They are designed to establish that potential owners are fit and proper for the job. It remains unclear just how unfit or improper you have had to be to fail this test. It’s a low bar indeed. Now the government is stepping in with plans for an Independent Regulator for English Football, or Iref – see what they did there? Clever! It will now be down to Iref to keep the wrong ’uns out. I offer my suggestion for the very first question Iref should put to any prospective football club owner. It goes like this: do you want to own a football club? If the answer is yes, then I’m afraid they need to be shown the door because the chances are they are either mad or bad; neither fit nor proper. There is no rational financial reason to own a football club. However big its income – be that from TV rights deals or other commercial activities – all of it, or usually much more than all of it, will end up in the pockets of players and their agents. How else do you explain the fantastical levels of debt even the world’s greatest clubs have accrued: Manchester United, about £500m; Barcelona, more than £1bn. What kind of person or country wants a piece of these businesses? However cleverly structured the debts may be, debt is debt. So if you are not buying a club to make money, and will surely lose money, you must be doing it for some other reason. This could be because you’re a great person who loves the club, or football generally, and want to do the right thing. If so, great. But if you’re not, I’m not sure what Iref or anyone else will be able to do about it. The likes of Russian and Chinese squillionaires, and oil-rich countries with sub-optimal human rights records, will always have the riches to tempt owners to sell. Fans will end up turning a blind eye to anything other than what success that money could help bring their beloved clubs. If the owner of your club wants to sell it for, let’s say, £250m, and they have a buyer who wants to give them £250m for it, I can’t see how a whole squad of red-card-brandishing Irefs are going to stop it happening. Anyone who’s about to trouser that £250m, or who’s intent on spending £250m, will have much more to spend on lawyers than Iref, or anyone else, to get the deal over the line. Iref’s proposals to keep out the baddies are detailed enough. They call it an “integrity test” – their quote marks, not mine. The use of the word integrity echoes the endless debate in the game regarding the laws on handball. Referees are asked to decide whether the handball was “deliberate”. How can they know? Surely, only the player on the end of the hand in question can answer that; it’s between them and their god, if they have one. We are told that a regulator will make an “overall, evidence-based judgment using expert opinion to assess whether an owner or director would be a suitable custodian of a club”. I wish them well. Here are the two questions I seriously think they will need to ask of any prospective owners. 1) Do you appreciate that when it comes down to it, you can never really own a club? Whatever the legal documents say, morally you’re merely the club’s custodian, charged with loving and cherishing it for the next generation. 2) When you move on, do you appreciate that you can’t just sell the club as you please to the highest bidder? No, you’ll have to go with whoever can look after it as diligently as you have. This might not make the price of a ticket affordable to your average postal worker, but it might just send an undesirable packing.

4/27/2022,"Kevin McCarthy, the senior Republican in the House of Representatives, privately accused one of his colleagues of “putting people in jeopardy” in the wake of the January 6 insurrection, according to a leaked audio recording. In a phone call with Republican leaders on 10 January 2021, McCarthy said that Matt Gaetz, a Florida congressman and ardent Trump supporter, was putting Americans at risk with his comments after the assault on the US Capitol that left five people dead. The New York Times obtained a recording of the call, in which McCarthy and Republicans including Steve Scalise, the No 2 House Republican, discussed an interview Gaetz had given where he attacked GOP members who had criticized Trump. “He’s putting people in jeopardy,” McCarthy said of Gaetz. “And he doesn’t need to be doing this. We saw what people would do in the Capitol, you know, and these people came prepared with rope, with everything else.” In the days after the insurrection McCarthy strongly criticized Trump, saying: “The president bears responsibility for Wednesday’s attack on Congress by mob rioters.” Since then McCarthy has defended Trump’s actions, suggesting Trump was unaware that the riot was taking place. In the 10 January call McCarthy also called out Mo Brooks, a congressman from Alabama who at a rally before Trump supporters attacked the Capitol said: “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.” “You think the president deserves to be impeached for his comments?” McCarthy asked those on the call. “That’s almost something that goes further than what the president said.” Discussing the statements and actions of some Republicans, McCarthy said: “Our members have got to start paying attention to what they say, too, and you can’t put up with that type of shit.” Lauren Boebert, a congresswoman from Colorado, and Barry Moore from Alabama, were among the other GOP members named in the call. Boebert has been a staunch defender of Trump’s actions that day. “Tension is too high, the country is too crazy, I do not want to look back and think we caused something or we missed something and someone got hurt,” McCarthy said in the call.",News/US news,McCarthy accused Republicans of ‘putting people in jeopardy’ after Capitol attack,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/27/kevin-mccarthy-capitol-attack-accusations-republicans
