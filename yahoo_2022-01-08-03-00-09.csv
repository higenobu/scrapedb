Elizabeth Hurley practically lives in a bathing suit (peep her Instagrams for proof), but she just dropped a bikini pic online that’s pretty much shutting down the Internet. In the Instagram post, the 56-year-old can be seen rocking a tan bikini for all it’s worth. Liz’s legs, arms, and abs look ridiculously sculpted, and it’s easy to see why fans totally freaked out in the comments over it. “Got this shot whilst on location filming Christmas in the Caribbean - just before I sprained my silly ankle,” she wrote in the caption. “Now, still on crutches and lying on the sofa, eating chocolates and feeling sorry for myself 🤷🏻♀️.” As for those comments… . “This should be illegal😍,” one person wrote. “Good God 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥,” another said. OK, but how does she mange to look so fit despite everything <gestures broadly> she’s got going on? Liz basically invented found fitness, and regularly spends her days doing all kinds of cool moves to work her muscles. That includes doing squats while she brushes her teeth in the morning, going for long walks with her dog that are fast enough to get her HR up, or gardening. Oh! And Liz is into logging. “I do a lot of exercise, but it’s really the gardening… cutting down a hedge, using my chainsaw to cut down a tree, logging, all of that stuff I do,” she told Extra. Yup, logging. All that said, Liz told Women’s Health that the gym isn’t really her thing. “I don't really do any set exercise, per se, because I prefer to get my exercise from doing something than being in the gym,” she said. Still, Liz has said that she “enjoys” Pilates, per the Daily Mail, although she added, “I don't do it often enough.” So, Liz spends lots of time outdoors, being all active. “I do as much outside during the winter as I do during the summer,” she told WH. “Not only do I feel, well, actually exhausted, but also I feel that I’ve got the leaves up, which is also a nice thing. I'd rather do housework than go to the gym...I'd rather scrub a mirror—it does just as much.” As for what she eats, Liz likes whole foods. ""I like simple, natural, easy food. I don’t really like food with a lot of chemicals or additives,"" she told The Cut. ""When I’m at home in the country, I always try and eat food that's grown locally. That goes for meats and vegetables.” Liz also likes to round out her evening with a lighter meal, like something with whole grains, veggies, and fish or lean meat. ""I think that's one of the best diet tips you can have, to eat your food earlier on in the day, so you've got more time to digest it, and your body can rest in the sleep period,” she told E! Now, where can I get that bikini?
