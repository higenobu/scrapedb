5/1/2022,"A Tennessee man has been sentenced to life in prison for violently stabbing his diner coworker to death days after she had told him she “just wanted to be friends.” It took the jury less than an hour Thursday to find Gabriel Enrique Turcios guilty of first-degree murder in the death of 19-year-old Savannah Burford, who was stabbed in the back parking lot of the Sunliner Diner in Pigeon Forge on January 8, 2020, according to WBIR. Burford’s mother, Julia Cutter—who had come to pick her up from the restaurant—watched in horror as her daughter was stabbed repeatedly in the neck by her coworker, staining her white and blue polka dot dress red with blood. Cutter rushed to try to help her daughter after Turcios had fled the scene, but it was too late and her daughter bled to death. “I could just lift her. She felt like a piece of paper,” Cutter told the station in an earlier interview. “The blood kept dripping all the way down. … It wouldn’t stop.” After the verdict was handed down in court Thursday, the jury deliberated briefly again before recommending a life sentence without parole. ""This is truly one of the most atrocious homicides I've seen,” Judge Rex Ogle said, according to WBIR. “There's not a person in this courtroom that hasn't felt for the family and friends of this young woman.” State prosecutors argued during the two-day trial that Turcios had flown into a “jealous rage” after he confided in Burford that he had a big “crush” on her and she turned down his romantic advances. “I think we should jut be friends,” she wrote in a text message just days before her death, according to the trial. “I’m sorry to maybe have lead [sic] you on and that wasn’t my intention.” While prosecutors argued that Turcios had been “fully functional” when he took her life days later, his defense team had tried to argue that he killed her during a moment of insanity. They pointed to his past medical history, including sickle cell disease and mental health problems, which they said led to his breaking point that night. His mother took the stand to talk about her son’s need for regular blood transfusions as a result of his sickle cell disease and abuse she said he suffered at the hands of his father early in life. A psychiatrist also testified that sickle cell disease can cause brain dysfunctions. During an interrogation, Turcios told police he had thought about killing his coworker for days and finally carried out the plan because the devil had made him do it.  He said he “regretted it” after he stabbed her 17 times. Burford’s family has said in a lawsuit filed after her death that Turcios had been aggressive and had been stalking her in the weeks before she was killed, local state WATE reports.  Jurors saw surveillance footage of the stabbing, which showed Turcios following behind Burford as she left the diner, before he attacked her.

5/1/2022,"A tight-knit community of weather lovers and storm chasers is grieving after the deaths of three University of Oklahoma meteorology students in a car crash late Friday while returning to Norman from storm chasing in Kansas. The loss of the students, Nicholas Nair, 20, of Denton, Texas; Gavin Short, 19, of Grayslake, Illinois; and Drake Brooks, 22, of Evansville, Indiana, prompted many to express their grief, but also to remember why they loved them. Leigh O'Neil, a geographic information science major at OU, said the three students were the ""kindest, smartest people"" she'd ever met. O'Neil said a selfie of the three mugging for the camera that they sent to their friends Friday is a perfect representation of how funny they were. ""You couldn't be around them without laughing your ass off,"" she said. ""They truly would do anything to help others out, even before their own well being,"" O'Neil added. ""They are already missed greatly. Their loss is insanely painful for us all."" Nair, Short and Brooks were driving southbound on a wet Interstate 35 near Tonkawa when their SUV hydroplaned, left the roadway to the right and then came back onto the highway and stopped. The 2017 Volkswagen Tiguan was struck by a semi traveling in the same direction, according to Oklahoma Highway Patrol. The three were pronounced dead at the scene about 85 miles north of Oklahoma City. Tonkawa Fire Department officials and paramedics worked nearly five and a half hours to remove them from the wreckage. The semi truck driver was transported to a hospital in Blackwell but has since been released. The accident took place around 11:23 p.m. Friday night, just three hours after the students witnessed a small tornado north of Herrington, Kansas, according to their Twitter accounts.

""I can find solace in the idea that now he can live among the clouds which he loved so much,"" Evan Short said. OU's College of Atmospheric and Geographic Sciences issued a statement saying that as finals weeks approaches, counseling was available ""as we all grieve this unthinkable heartbreak."" ""Our community in Atmospheric and Geographic Sciences is close-knit, and our School of Meteorology is very much a family. Now, more than ever, we must come together in kindness and heartfelt support for one another. Please join us in offering thoughts and prayers for those most impacted, and providing them with privacy,"" the statement said. Those in the weather and meteorology community took to Twitter Saturday to express their condolences over the news. Chris Dixon, a fellow OU meteorology student, was part of a separate group of students storm chasing Friday. He saw his first tornado over Andover, Kansas, but woke up Saturday to hear that three peers had died. In the past 24 hours, I've had a range of emotions. I was sad (I thought my first chase was going to be a bust), I was joy-filled (I saw my first tornado), and I was in shock (waking up to news that fellow OU students died). — Chris Dixon (@catholic_wx) April 30, 2022 ""Words cannot describe this rollercoaster of emotions from one of the highest points of my life to one of the most close-to-home serious ones,"" Dixon wrote on Twitter Saturday. A well known storm chaser and OU meteorology alum Reed Timmer called the students friends and said they are close to his heart. ""My thoughts and prayers go out to their families and friends,"" Timmer said. Heartbreaking loss of 3 OU students in an accident on the way back from chasing. These students are close to my heart and a shining light in the weather community. Words cannot describe the sadness. My thoughts and prayers go out to their families and friends.

5/1/2022,"Remains discovered during a Houston-area search in December have been identified as those of Taylor Pomaski, the missing girlfriend of former NFL player Kevin Ware, authorities said Saturday. The identification was made by the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences, Harris County Sheriff's Office Senior Deputy Thomas Gilliland said by email. “The investigation is still open and active and homicide investigators are diligent on bringing this case to a close,” Gilliland said. Pomaski, 29, was last seen April 25, 2021, at a party at her home in Spring, Texas, the sheriff's office said. Her disappearance was described as suspicious. The remains were found Dec. 10 at a site in north Harris County that had been identified during the investigation, Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said at at the time. Ware, former tight end for the San Francisco 49ers, was questioned about her disappearance in June, authorities said. The sheriff's office has not named any suspects or persons of interest. The former player has been in Montgomery County Jail north of Houston, for 10 months, according to inmate records. His residence is in nearby Spring. Ware was being held without bail after allegedly violating conditions of bond for a case involving drug and weapons charges unrelated to the disappearance, according to NBC affiliate KPRC of Houston. In a June court filing that sought to have his bond revoked, Montgomery County prosecutors described the athlete as a suspect in the Pomaski case, but that designation has not been used by lead investigators on the case from Harris County. In December, Ware’s attorney, Coby DuBose, told KPRC, “That filing is the first time that it’s been suggested that he is a suspect.” ""He’s been cooperative,"" the lawyer said at the time. ""He’s told the police everything that he knows and he’s led them through his house."" DuBose did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday.",U.S./NBC News,Remains found in Texas ID'd as missing girlfriend of ex-NFL player Kevin Ware,https://news.yahoo.com/remains-found-texas-idd-missing-233309677.html
