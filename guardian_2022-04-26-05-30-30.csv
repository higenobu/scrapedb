4/26/2022,"Elon Musk has agreed to buy Twitter in a $44bn deal that will give the world’s richest man control of a social network with more than 200 million users. The sale puts the Tesla chief executive in charge of a company that he has frequently criticized for not living up to its potential as a platform for “free speech”. Shares of Twitter rose 5% on Monday to $51.50 per share. The deal comes after a dramatic few weeks of speculation about Twitter’s future, triggered by Musk’s emergence as the platform’s largest single shareholder on 4 April. He then declared a $43bn takeover bid on 14 April. “Twitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world,” Twitter’s chief executive, Parag Agrawal, said in a tweet confirming the sale. “Deeply proud of our teams and inspired by the work that has never been more important.” Agrawal will reportedly host an all-hands meeting for employees on Monday afternoon to address the news. The Musk takeover has been unexpected and controversial amongst Twitter employees. Twitter’s board at first enacted an anti-takeover measure known as a poison pill that could have made a takeover attempt prohibitively expensive. But its initial reluctance to accept a transaction appeared to fade after Musk confirmed a funding package for the deal and shareholders warmed to it. The company, which launched in 2006, currently has a market cap of nearly $40bn. Its co-founder Jack Dorsey stepped down as chief executive officer in November 2021, handing the reins to Agrawal, the company’s former chief technology officer. Musk is himself a prominent user of the app, with 83m followers, and tweeted as early as 2017 expressing interest in buying the company. He has signalled that Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company in order to build trust with users and do better at serving what he calls the “societal imperative” of free speech. “I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,” he tweeted on Monday. In recent weeks, Musk voiced a number of proposed changes for the company, including relaxing its content restrictions, ridding the platform of fake and automated accounts, and shifting away from its advertising-based revenue model. But despite claiming to be a “free speech absolutist”, Musk regularly blocks social media users who have criticized him or his company and has used the platform to bully reporters who have written critical articles about him or his company. The deal is not expected to face serious scrutiny from US competition authorities because Musk’s major business interests – Tesla, an electric car company, the SpaceX rocket business, and the tunnelling firm the Boring Company – do not compete with Twitter. However, the deal is likely to draw comment from politicians and campaigning bodies given Twitter’s influence as an information source and Musk’s stance on free speech. That ethos has led many to wonder if Musk would reinstate high profile accounts that have previously been removed for violating community guidelines, including that of the former US president Donald Trump. Trump was permanently banned from Twitter in 2021 for his use of the platform to promote riots at the US capitol. Trump told Fox News on Monday that he would not return to Twitter, even if his account were reinstated, and was joining his own startup Truth Social instead. “I hope Elon buys Twitter because he’ll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth,” Trump said. The purchase comes amid intensifying criticism of big tech’s power and underscores the ability of wealthy executives to control platforms used by millions. “No matter who owns or runs Twitter, the president has long been concerned about the power of large social media platforms,” the White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki commented on the purchase on Monday. Musk is the world’s wealthiest person, according to Forbes, with a nearly $279bn fortune. He began making his fortune in 1999 when he sold Zip2, an online mapping and business directory, for $307m. He used his share to create what would become PayPal, sold to eBay for $1.5bn in 2002. That same year, Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, after finding that cost constraints were limiting Nasas interplanetary travel. The company eventually developed cost-effective reusable rockets. In 2004, Musk was courted to invest in Tesla, then a startup trying to build an electric car. Eventually he became CEO and led the company to astronomical success as the world’s most valuable automaker and largest seller of electric vehicles.

4/26/2022,"Shortly before the Tokyo Olympics a top British gymnastics coach was removed from the Great Britain Olympic coaching team on account of allegations about her treatment of a former gymnast, according to a report published by BBC Sport. The veteran coach Liz Kincaid coached a number of gymnasts including Amelie Morgan, part of the historic Olympic bronze medal‑winning team in Tokyo, but an allegation was made against her relating to the mental health of one her former gymnasts, which prompted an investigation. Under the British Olympic Association rules the investigation left her ineligible for the British team in Tokyo. In July 2021 it was announced that Kincaid would retire from the sport. Two gymnasts have since stepped forward with further allegations against Kincaid, which range from claims that she implored them to compete while seriously injured to her shaming gymnasts about their weight. Poppy Wynn, a 25‑year‑old former gymnast, said she tore her perineum at 12 years old after falling off the uneven bars during an unmonitored set and landing in oversplits. Kincaid allegedly told Wynn’s mother that she had merely started her period but doctors immediately identified a far more serious injury. “I went to Liz, I had blood dripping down my leg and she then took me into the office and gave me sanitary pads to effectively mop up the blood and then sent me back into the gym,” Wynn told the BBC. Wynn claimed that, under Kincaid, she trained on a broken hand for six weeks, while the former British champion Sophie Jameson said she was made to train on a broken ankle and she was once required to continue “excruciating” upper body training while recovering from a dislocated knee. Both gymnasts said Kincaid spoke to them demeaningly, shouting in the faces of gymnasts and weight-shaming them. Kincaid has denied all of the allegations made against her, issuing a statement to the BBC. It read: “The health, well-being and safety of the gymnasts under my care and tuition was of paramount importance to me and a matter close to my heart. To suggest I would mistreat the gymnasts goes against every principle I live by and is very upsetting.” The allegations are the latest in a long list of similar claims as gymnastics reckons with allegations of abusive coaching methods widespread around the world. In 2020 numerous British gymnasts, including Becky and Ellie Downie, Nile Wilson and Amy Tinkler, came forward with accusations of mistreatment and abuse against a number of the sport’s coaches and officials. British gymnastics is under an independent investigation led by Anne Whyte QC and initiated by UK Sport and Sport England. Its findings are due to be published next month.",Sport/Sport,Gymnastics coach was pulled from GB squad over mistreatment allegations,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/25/gymnastics-coach-pulled-from-team-gb-squad-after-allegations-of-mistreatment
4/26/2022,"Conservative whips have said they are trying to find out the identity of the Tory MP responsible for misogynistic attacks on Angela Rayner, with a view to taking disciplinary action after Boris Johnson threatened to unleash “the terrors of the earth” against the culprit. The prime minister hit out at the “sexist, misogynistic tripe” in the Mail on Sunday, which ran allegations from an anonymous MP that Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, deliberately tried to distract Johnson by crossing and uncrossing her legs in the House of Commons. Following outrage across Westminster, the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, told MPs on Monday that he had asked for a meeting with the Mail on Sunday editor, David Dillon, as well as the chair of the press gallery in the Commons. It comes after Caroline Nokes, the Conservative chair of the women and equalities committee, wrote to Hoyle asking him to look into revoking the parliamentary pass of the article’s author, Glen Owen. Amid pressure to unmask the MP behind the claims, a source close to the whips said: “Questions are being asked around the palace and if the anonymous source is identified, action will be taken.” However, their action appears to stop short of a formal investigation. The Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso) received more than 5,000 complaints about the story, which Rayner described as “gutter journalism” while accusing the sources of “spreading desperate, perverted smears in their doomed attempts to save [the prime minister’s] skin”. The newspaper had reported that a Tory MP claimed Rayner was adopting a “Basic Instinct” style ploy towards Johnson, in a reference to the Sharon Stone 1992 film in which she flashes a policeman during an interview. Following the outcry, a number of female MPs spoke of their own experiences of sexism in Westminster. Nokes told the Guardian’s First Edition newsletter that she had once been the subject of an article along with former Tory MP Claire Perry “that actually compared our boobs”. Labour MP Kim Leadbeater recounted how she had been in a meeting with a male MP who “definitely spoke more comfortably … to my male staff member than he did to me”. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, told BBC Radio 4 that a Tory MP had questioned how, with a newborn baby, she would have been able to be a cabinet minister if Labour had won the election. She said the slur against Rayner was “the sort of thing that happens day in, day out in parliament”. The incident “shines a spotlight” on other female MPs’ experiences of sexism and misogyny, she said. “I am sick and tired of the way that female MPs and women are treated in parliament, and if this story, this outrageous slur on Angela, gets change, that would be a good thing,” she said. Johnson suggested his party would investigate to find out who was responsible for the claims. Asked whether there was a cultural problem in parliament, Johnson said: “It’s hard to say on the basis of that particular story. But I have to say I thought it was the most appalling load of sexist, misogynist tripe. I immediately got in touch with Angela and we had a very friendly exchange.” In a reference to King Lear, he threatened to unleash “the terrors of the earth” on the source behind the comments if they were identified. “If we ever find who is responsible for it, I don’t know what we will do, but they will be the terrors of the earth,” he said. “It’s totally intolerable, that kind of thing.” The Speaker has not commented on the calls for Owen to lose his Commons pass but is expected to give Dillon a dressing down when he meets the newspaper’s editor. There is also a precedent for a non-MP being hauled before the House of Commons itself to apologise for an article – in 1957. On that occasion, the editor of the Sunday Express, John Junor, was brought by the serjeant at arms to the bar and admonished by the Speaker for publishing an article that cast doubt on the integrity of MPs over their constituency petrol allowances. In the Commons on Monday, Hoyle said: “I share the views expressed by a wide range of members … that yesterday’s article was reporting unsubstantial claims [that were] misogynistic and offensive. Those are what we believe. In being demeaning, offensive to women in parliament, it can only deter women who might considering standing for election, to the detriment of us all.” Earlier on Monday, Chris Philp, a junior minister, said he expected government whips would investigate and that if the source’s identity emerged then he would “imagine they would be subject to discipline”.Asked why Johnson and the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, had posted identical tweets denouncing the claims, Philp said this was “nothing surprising” because they had “reached the same view and they have used the same words”.",News/Politics,Tory whips ‘asking questions’ to find MP behind Angela Rayner claims,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/25/angela-rayner-sexism-misogyny-tory-whips
4/26/2022,"MPs and peers are set for some late nights over the next few days as government and opposition race to complete six bills in time for parliament to be prorogued by the end of this week. Though the House of Commons leader, Mark Spencer, said business would conclude by Thursday – which would give MPs next week to get some shoe leather on the pavements ahead of the local elections – the Lords may have other ideas. It means whips may decide to have the Commons sit next Tuesday and Wednesday, potentially throwing some MPs’ election schedules into disarray. The unpalatability of that prospect may force the government to compromise on amendments to legislation made by the House of Lords – who have signalled they are prepared to continue to send bills back to the Commons even at the 11th hour. The parliamentary battles in the week ahead read like a rogues gallery of all the most difficult and controversial proposals that Boris Johnson has announced – from noisy protests, to offshoring asylum seekers, to costs for renters in unsafe buildings and changes to election law. On Monday, peers amended the elections bill to strengthen the independence of the electoral commission, having previously also voted to prevent the use of voter ID. The elections bill and the nationality and borders bill are among those where compromise appears the most likely in the coming days – which could have some significant ramifications. Peers made 12 amendments to the bill, which returns to the Lords on Tuesday without compromise. At least six are expected to be returned to the Commons again on totemic issues such as the right of asylum seekers to work after six months, proposed by the Tory peer Philippa Stroud. The Lords also voted to amend the controversial offshoring proposals in the bill, which would allow asylum seekers to be sent overseas to a third country for their claims to be processed. The government announced its policy of sending claimants to Rwanda for asylum since the last debate. Another policy that peers are expected to double down on is an amendment from Labour peer Vernon Coaker to water down a provision in the bill on arriving in the UK without permission. It would clarify that the new offence applies only to those doing so in breach of a deportation order. There are other bills where Lords sources believe the government could make concessions in order to get them through in time. On the judicial review and courts bill, peers are hopefully of a win – or at the very least a commitment to review – on an amendment on legal aid for the bereaved. Peers are also likely to return their amendment to the policing bill, to change the proposed new law that would outlaw noisy protests. On all these issues, it is possible the government will not give any further ground. Or the compromises offered could be acceptable but weak – a promise of a review of the policy in a certain time period, for example. Crossbenchers, on which many of the votes will ultimately depend, often lose appetite for inflicting defeats on the elected house. But most peers who seek to change the legislation seem resolute – especially on the borders bill. It will be interesting to see if the bill about which Johnson and Priti Patel have been their noisiest will end up having some kind of quiet compromise on its most eye-watering proposals.",News/UK news,Election schedules could favour compromise on government’s most controversial bills,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/25/election-schedules-could-favour-compromise-on-governments-most-controversial-bills
4/26/2022,"Elon Musk, the owner of one of Twitter’s most followed accounts, is now its owner. On the evidence of his tweets over the past month, expect change at the social media platform. Here are some of the biggest issues you can expect him to address. Musk has described himself as a “free speech absolutist”, and the fate of the former US president’s suspended Twitter account represents a strong test of that ideal. Trump was banned permanently shortly after the Capitol riot in January 2021, as the company cited his repeated violations of the company’s rules and the risk of “further incitement of violence”. Musk said this month that he was “very cautious with permanent bans” on Twitter and would prefer a timeout system. But he has not directly addressed the issue of Trump’s account, which had almost 89 million followers. Speaking at a TED conference, Musk said: “I think it’s very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech. Twitter has become kind of the de facto town square, so it’s just really important that people have the … reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law.” However, Trump was banned in part because Twitter feared his tweets were inciting law-breaking. Musk has to reconcile his free speech principles with legal reality – and Trump’s history on the platform. On Monday evening the former president told Fox News he did not even wish to return and would use his own startup, Truth Social, instead. Nonetheless, one group of House Republicans has urged Musk to act. Hey, @elonmusk it's a great week to free @realDonaldTrump. The social media industry is coming under more stringent regulation, particularly in Europe. Last week the EU announced the Digital Services Act, under which companies such as Twitter, Facebook and Google will have to do more to tackle illegal content or face multibillion-euro fines. It will be preceded by the UK’s online safety bill, which requires social media platforms to protect their users from harmful content and comes into force at about the end of the year. In the US there are moves for regulatory change, although they must overcome perennial political gridlock. Legislative proposals in Washington include creating a new digital safety bureau at the Federal Trade Commission and the creation of new children’s safety requirements for tech companies. The latter is co-sponsored by the Democrat senator Richard Blumenthal, who led an explosive evidence session with the Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen last year and has been vocal in his support for the greater regulation of social media. Twitter investors have long been concerned with the company’s growth in revenue and users. In its most recent quarterly results, revenue grew more slowly than expected, despite rising 22% to $1.6bn in the last three months of 2021. However, daily active users rose by 25 million over the year to 217 million as the company reiterated its goal of hitting 315 million such users by the end of next year. In a since-deleted tweet this month, Musk raised the possibility of removing advertising from the platform’s premium service, Blue, which is available in the US and Australia but not the UK. Twitter makes 90% of its annual revenue of $5bn (£3.8bn) from advertising, so Musk was broaching a potentially radical move. Musk is not the first Twitter shareholder to express concerns about how the company is run. Elliott Management, an activist investment firm, took a stake in Twitter in 2020, amid reports that it thought the platform had a distracted chief executive in Jack Dorsey and was not adding innovative new products quickly enough. Dorsey survived the initial pressure but left in November last year and his replacement, Parag Agrawal, was promoted to the top post from the position of chief technology officer. In a message to the Twitter chairman, Bret Taylor, Musk made clear that another executive shake-up is in the offing if he succeeds in buying the company. “If the deal doesn’t work, given that I don’t have confidence in management nor do I believe I can drive the necessary change in the public market, I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder.” Musk is CEO of Tesla and the rocket company SpaceX, as well as being the owner of the tunnelling business the Boring Company, so there are enough demands on his time already. Tesla shareholders will want Musk to stay focused on running a $1tn electric carmaker but it would be a surprise if Musk is a hands-off owner of Twitter. There will be changes at Twitter under Musk’s ownership and an edit button is one of the options under consideration. In a flurry of tweets posted in the wake of his emergence as a 9.2% shareholder in Twitter earlier this month, Musk flagged the possibility of introducing the feature. The ability to undo a tweet posted in haste is available to Blue subscribers only, who have a 60-second grace period after posting their tweet in which they can remove it before it is seen by anyone. Do you want an edit button? Twitter subsequently confirmed that it had been looking at the edit button idea. Other changes suggested by Musk include making Twitter’s algorithm open source, meaning users would be able to view the algorithm that curates what users see. Musk has also said that Twitter users should be able to see if their post has been promoted or demoted.",News/Technology,Five things in Elon Musk’s in-tray after Twitter takeover,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/25/five-things-in-elon-musks-in-tray-after-twitter-takeover
4/26/2022,"It’s normal practice for a prime minister to report back to the House at the first available opportunity on returning from an overseas trip. So you’d have thought Boris Johnson would have been keen to make a statement to the Commons about last week’s Indian adventure. Both to tell stories of how he bravely forgot to mention India’s neutrality towards Russia in its war on Ukraine during his meeting with the prime minister, Narendra Modi, and of a country in which he isn’t universally disliked and mistrusted. But The Convict thought better of it. He used to regard the Commons as his natural habitat. An environment in which he was guaranteed to get the love and laughter that he craves. Now it’s a symbol of his disgrace. An unwelcome reminder of his dishonesty. A sore that can never begin to heal until either he does the decent thing and resigns or his fragile ego crumbles under the weight of his lies. The only MPs to even pretend to believe a word he says these days are the spineless ministerial apparatchiks, now engaged in a constant internal struggle between abject denial and cognitive dissonance – think the junior culture minister Chris Philp, who has yet to find an arse he didn’t want to brown-nose and who had sworn blind on national television on Monday morning that it was entirely plausible that Johnson and Nadine Dorries could have independently sent identical tweets: how little self-worth must you have to do that? – and fawning halfwitted sycophants, such as Micky Fabricant. The rest either confront The Convict head on, either openly laughing or spitting with rage at his deceit, or maintain a silence laced with contempt. So instead of staying in Westminster, thanking his lucky stars that he hadn’t yet received a second fixed-penalty notice for the party in which the empties and the stragglers had been picked out of the flowerbeds, Johnson had headed north to Bury. Quite what he was doing there was anyone’s guess. According to Number 10, he was campaigning for the local elections. But as most councillors now concede that he is a liability, the only thing he can have been campaigning for is to increase the number of Tory losses next week. After kicking a football aimlessly at Bury FC, Johnson did a pool clip for the lunchtime news. Inevitably, most questions focused on his reaction to the previous day’s Mail on Sunday article in which a Tory MP had claimed Angela Rayner tried to distract Johnson at prime minister’s questions by crossing and uncrossing her legs. The Convict said he was furious. Not only had a woman never managed to put him off his stride in the past – he had maintained his laser-like focus even when Jennifer Arcuri had been pole-dancing in front of him – but such misogyny had no place in his Tory party. “If we ever find who is responsible for it,” he said, “I don’t know what we will do, but they will be the terrors of the Earth.” This sounded very much like a quote from King Lear. A subject on which Johnson may yet become an expert if he ever gets round to employing a researcher to write most of the Shakespeare biography for which he has trousered a reported £800k advance. Though he might now be wishing he had chosen his Lear more carefully. The extract he referenced is from when Lear is in the process of going mad and losing his kingdom. Who knows, within a few days he might take to walking naked on the heath. Then the emperor really will have no clothes. It also wasn’t entirely clear just how seriously Johnson was taking the Rayner claims. He did at least manage not to smirk as he condemned those who had briefed the story but The Convict himself has form for sexism and misogyny. Just think of his descriptions of women beach volleyball players at the 2012 Olympics as “glistening like wet otters” and women in burkas as “letterboxes”. Or that women who voted Tory would have bigger breasts. Even when he’s seemingly not to blame, he’s still a liability. His weight of baggage is just too heavy. One person who was taking this seriously was the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, who began proceedings in the Commons by saying he had arranged a meeting with the editor of the Mail on Sunday to discuss the matter. We then moved on to Home Office departmental questions. A rather bloodless affair, which had the feel of everyone going through the motions in the run-up to another week’s recess before the state opening of parliament. Still, even an only semi-engaged Priti Patel is plenty vicious and stupid enough to provide some entertainment. She sat proudly beside Tom Pursglove, a junior Home Office minister who might possibly be dimmer than she is – even between them both they can’t supply a connecting synapse – only to stand up to once more declare Rwanda to be an African paradise. If there was a problem with her asylum seeker policy it was that the Channel would be overcrowded with refugees coming over in search of a free air ticket. And anyone who questioned Rwanda’s human rights record was just racist. It was when she got to the costs that she became seriously deranged. It wasn’t up to her to tell the Commons how much the scheme would cost, she insisted. It was up to the opposition parties to come up with different proposals. Though if she had listened, she would have realised they had. But by now, Priti Vacant was off on one. Labour shouldn’t care about what the scheme costs as they had said it was unworkable. So it wouldn’t cost the taxpayer anything anyway. She paused to give her own benches a knowing look. She genuinely thought it was a “Gotcha” moment.

4/26/2022,"The US defense secretary’s declaration that Washington wanted to see Russia weakened militarily and unable to recover quickly, marks a shift in Washington’s declared aims underlying its military support for Ukraine. At a press conference in Poland after a surprise visit to Kyiv, Lloyd Austin was asked if he would now define US goals differently from those set out soon after the Russian invasion. In response, he started out with the established administration line about helping Ukraine retain its sovereignty and defend its territory. Then Austin added a second goal: “We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine.” That meant Russia should “not have the capability to very quickly reproduce” the forces and equipment that had been lost in Ukraine. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, estimated those losses on Monday as a quarter of Russia’s pre-invasion strength, with more than 2,000 armoured vehicles knocked out, including at least 530 tanks, as well as 60 aircraft. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who travelled with Austin to see Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv, agreed with his formulation of US objectives, saying: “I think the secretary said it very well”. The two officials were talking as the first howitzers from the latest tranche of US military supplies began arriving in Ukraine, and $165m in supplies of “non-standard” ex-Soviet compatible ammunition was announced. The remarks suggested that even if Russian forces withdrew or were expelled from the Ukrainian territory they have occupied since 24 February, the US and its allies would seek to maintain sanctions with the aim of stopping Russia reconstituting its forces. It also indicated Washington is taking a position in an internal debate within Nato on whether to use the opportunity of Vladimir Putin’s strategic blunder in Ukraine to try to hobble his ability to threaten other countries in the future. “The balance in Nato itself has shifted,” Rajan Menon, the director of the grand strategy programme at the Defense Priorities thinktank, said. “The argument now seems to be this is not just about Ukraine; it’s about a larger problem, that is the threat that Russia poses to Europe as a whole. And if you look at it that way, then these comments begin to make sense.” “The Russians are on the retreat, so you have this flush of optimism which has moved the goalposts,” Menon, professor emeritus in international relations at Columbia University, said. “Once Washington says it, those in Nato who want the war to be about that are empowered, because what the US says matters.” If those are the Biden administration’s aims, there is a separate question of whether it was sensible to declare them so bluntly. It arguably weakens Russia’s incentive to withdraw, reinforces Moscow’s narrative that Nato is waging a proxy war in Ukraine aimed at weakening Russia and even regime change, deepening Putin’s paranoia. “If I was writing the secretary’s talking points, I would prefer he said: our goal is that Ukraine wins, rather than our goal is to weaken Russia because they are two sides of the same coin, but one would have been much more aligned with what the administration has been saying,” said Alina Polyakova, the president of the Center for European Policy Analysis, said. “Certainly this will be used by the Russian state media to double down on the narrative that we’ve already seen from the Russian government, that the US is ‘out to get us’, that they want to destroy Russia,” she said, but added: “Frankly, I don’t think we should worry too much about how this will be spun by the Russian media, because they can spin anything.” Ultimately, Polyakova said, Austin was voicing a widespread feeling about the long-term threat posed by Putin that is increasingly difficult to ignore. “I think the secretary’s comments were truthful in that it will be in the greater interest of global stability and European security not to have a military aggressive state, bordering Nato or bordering Europe,” she said. “I think that’s very obvious.”",News/World news,Pentagon chief’s Russia remarks show shift in US’s declared aims in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/25/russia-weakedend-lloyd-austin-ukraine
4/26/2022,"The Texas court of criminal appeals has issued a stay of execution for Melissa Lucio, the Mexican-American woman who was set to be judicially killed within 48 hours, ordering a lower court to consider new evidence of her innocence in the death of her two-year-old daughter Mariah. The court issued its order on Monday as the final clock was ticking on Lucio’s transfer to the death chamber. She would have been the first Hispanic woman executed by Texas. As Wednesday’s scheduled execution date grew closer, calls for a stay to give time for new scientific evidence of her innocence to be reviewed grew to fever pitch. The intensity of the outcry against her pending death rivaled that of the case of Troy Davis, the African American man executed by Georgia in 2011 despite serious doubts around his guilt. New evidence presented by Lucio’s legal team in a 266-page petition suggested that the murder of her toddler daughter had never even happened. Medical and eye-witness evidence pointed towards Mariah having died after accidentally falling down a steep flight of stairs at Lucio’s rental home. In a statement, Lucio thanked the court of criminal appeals for giving her the chance “to live and prove my innocence. Mariah is in my heart today and always.” Sandra Babcock, one of Lucio’s legal team and a professor at Cornell law school, said that the court’s decision paved the way for a new trial which would allow a jury to hear evidence that was not presented at her original trial in 2008. Five of the 12 jury members from that trial have said that had they known what is now known about the case they would have decided differently. Babcock said: “Melissa’s life matters. As a survivor of childhood sexual abuse and intimate partner violence, and now locked away for these past 15 years, Melissa’s voice and experiences have never been valued. The Court’s decision signals its willingness to finally hear Melissa’s side of the story.” Vanessa Potkin of the Innocence Project, who also represents Lucio, said: “Medical evidence shows that Mariah’s death was consistent with an accident. But for the State’s use of false testimony, no juror would have voted to convict Melissa of capital murder because no murder occurred.” Jeff Leach, the Republican lawmaker who led the push in the Texas House for a delay of execution, greeted the news of the stay with delight, saying it would secure “justice for Melissa and for Mariah and the entire Lucio family”. Earlier, Leach told the Guardian in an interview that the failings of the prosecution in Lucio’s case had shaken his belief in the death penalty.

Leach has been at the forefront of efforts by Texas lawmakers to persuade the authorities to postpone the execution. He orchestrated a letter to the board of pardons signed by 80 House members, 32 of whom are Republican. A similar letter has been sent by 20 Texas senators, eight Republican. In the House letter, the lawmakers pointed out that Lucio was treated by prosecutors in a completely different way to her husband, who was also responsible for Mariah’s care.

4/26/2022,"Sajid Javid is being urged to change the law to let pharmacists alter prescriptions during medicine shortages, as it emerged that some women are travelling hundreds of miles to seek hormone replacement therapy products. There have been acute shortages of some HRT products, which are used by about 1 million women in the UK to treat symptoms of the menopause. Claire Anderson, the president of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, said community pharmacists should be able to dispense substitute versions of medicines on prescription without having to contact the prescriber – typically a GP – every time. Currently, the law in England stipulates they must provide only the exact prescription. The proposed shake-up would also let pharmacists make changes to quantities, strength and formulation of HRT and other medicines dispensed. “At the moment pharmacists cannot amend prescriptions for HRT, so have to refer women back to their GPs when a medicine is not available,” Anderson said. “Enabling pharmacists to do so will save time for patients, pharmacists and doctors, as well as lessening the anxiety for women waiting for medicines.” On Sunday Javid announced plans to appoint a HRT tsar to get to grips with the shortages. The number of HRT products prescribed in England has more doubled in the last five years, contributing to stocks running low, while manufacturers have reported supply problems. Some women are sharing their prescriptions or travelling hundreds of miles to source products, and there are fears that some women may be becoming suicidal as a result of their symptoms going untreated. Anderson said she welcomed Javid’s plan to recruit a HRT tsar, but she added: “With continued concerns from patient groups about medicines supply for people with other conditions, this appointment must be part of a wider government strategy to ensure patient access to medicines.” She said: “Pharmacists spend many hours dealing with medicines shortages when we’d rather be talking to patients about their care. One solution would be to enable pharmacists to make minor changes to a prescription when something is out of stock. This is faster for patients and more efficient for the NHS. “Difficulties in accessing HRT unfairly impacts women, affects their mental health and worsens health inequalities – this is an area that not only impacts our patients but also the health and care workforce.” The Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee (PSNC), which represents NHS community pharmacies in England, said demand was outstripping supply for a small number of HRT medicines, and longer, 12-month prescriptions were exacerbating the situation. “Disruptions to medicines supply can fluctuate very rapidly and on a very localised basis,” a PSNC spokesperson said. “The situation is very variable depending on demand, local prescribing and existing stock levels in pharmacies, and it is difficult to gain a snapshot of where supply is sitting as it is constantly moving through the supply chain. “We know that some pharmacies are receiving HRT prescriptions from women and prescribers hundreds of miles away, but we don’t have anything to confirm whether there is any significant regional variation in supplies.” Janet Morrison, the chief executive of the PSNC, said: “The current disruption to supplies of some HRT medicines appears to only be affecting a small number of medicines, and most pharmacies report that they are able to help women in need of medication quickly. “The disruption appears to be being driven by sudden increases in demand for some medicines, and by some prescriptions being written for much longer periods than is usual. It is incredibly worrying for women if they are not able to access medicines that they rely on. Pharmacies teams know this, and they will do all that they can to help. In many cases, other formulations may be available, although this can take a little time for pharmacies to sort out as they will need to speak to your GP first.” The Labour MP Carolyn Harris, a co-chair of the UK menopause taskforce, welcomed ministers’ promises to address the shortages. She said: “The trouble with the menopause is for far too long women have not been listened to, women have been ignored, they’ve been prescribed and diagnosed with other conditions and the menopause wasn’t even considered.”",News/Society,Calls to relax pharmacy rules amid HRT shortages in England,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/25/calls-to-relax-pharmacy-rules-amid-hrt-shortages-in-england
4/26/2022,"Battered and bruised, France’s “republican front” did its job once more in Sunday’s presidential election runoff. Faced with the prospect of a far-right takeover of the Élysée, a sufficient number of voters put aside their reservations regarding Emmanuel Macron and made him the first president to win a second term in office for 20 years. In the end, Mr Macron’s 58%-42% victory over Marine Le Pen was much more comfortable than seemed likely a few weeks ago, when some polls predicted a knife-edge contest. For France – and the rest of Europe – the alternative outcome would have been disastrous and destabilising. Ms Le Pen’s authoritarian, nationalist and xenophobic vision would have led to civil strife domestically and undermined solidarity between western democracies at a vital time. That Mr Macron successfully averted this worst-case scenario is a cause for celebration. But as his victory speech on Sunday night tacitly acknowledged, an election won with the help of the fear factor has delivered an exceptionally fragile mandate. Describing France as riven by doubt and division, Mr Macron pledged to be “not the candidate of one camp, but the president of all of us”. Such assurances are commonplace from victorious political leaders, but it is vital that Mr Macron makes good on them during a second term, which looks challenging to say the least. As the election laid bare, France is dangerously divided along economic and generational fault lines. A majority of blue-collar workers – and more than four in 10 voters overall – opted for Ms Le Pen. This, the best score in the history of the French far right, allowed Ms Le Pen to declare her share of the vote a “victory in itself”. Disturbingly, it indicates that the normalisation of her movement is all but complete. Mr Macron’s core vote, by contrast, came from wealthy business people, middle-class professionals and retired people. Younger, well educated but economically precarious voters who supported the radical left candidate, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, in the first round were left without a dog in the fight. Reflecting widespread disillusionment with the choice on offer, particularly among the young, the rate of abstention was the highest for a presidential runoff since 1969. Among potential voters under the age of 25, more than 40% failed to cast a ballot. Enough voters on the left lent their support to Mr Macron to keep the far right out of power, but in fewer numbers than in 2017. Hostilities on the right and the left will now be resumed ahead of parliamentary elections in June. If he is to successfully navigate this volatile political landscape, Mr Macron will need to adopt a radically different playbook from the one that characterised his first five years in the Élysée. During that time, he acquired a reputation as the “president of the rich” after watering down a wealth tax, pursuing unpopular pension reforms and imposing a fuel tax that sparked the gilets jaunes movement. An autocratic style contributed to the widespread impression that Mr Macron’s declared intention to transform and liberalise the French economy would be accomplished at the expense of the less well-off. To make good on his aspirations to reach out across the divides, Mr Macron will need to do far more to address such concerns and insecurities. During a campaign that became unexpectedly close, there were signs that this was being recognised. In an encouraging early statement of intent, it has already been signalled that there will be full consultation with unions and other bodies over proposals to raise the retirement age from 62 to 65. As the cost-of-living crisis bites, in a still fragile post-Covid economy, Mr Macron should also recognise that more needs to be done to protect and improve the living standards of blue-collar workers and the youthful precariat, which voted en masse for Mr Mélenchon. As he contemplates five more years in office, Mr Macron must realise that he has been given not so much a mandate as another chance.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Macron’s victory: a fragile mandate | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/25/the-guardian-view-on-macrons-victory-a-fragile-mandate
4/26/2022,"New evidence of the extent of the privatisation of mental healthcare in England is extremely concerning. Ministers and health bosses must explain why the independent sector is earning almost £2bn a year for treating patients with psychiatric conditions – or 13.5% of NHS England’s entire mental health budget. Overall, about 7% of spending is on private providers, although this rose during the pandemic. It is difficult to think of a good reason why the proportion of mentally unwell people treated by private providers should be so much higher than the proportion of those with other conditions. If patient safety and care quality were the only considerations, extremely vulnerable mental health patients would seem to be among the least suitable candidates for outsourcing. After all, the general rule is that while standardised treatments such as cataract operations can be delivered via the independent sector relatively straightforwardly, more complex and long-term work is kept in-house. Why inpatient psychiatric care for under-18s should defy this rule, with 55% of all NHS-funded treatment delivered privately, is a troubling question for anyone who cares about the future of healthcare. The short answer, of course, is that the NHS does not have the resources or the staff to do this work itself. This leaves doctors and managers with no choice, as one psychiatrist described at the weekend. Years of underinvestment in the health service have hit the mental health sector hard. Currently, there are 10,123 private mental health beds in England (the NHS has 17,610) and private mental health providers earn 91% of their income from the NHS. But psychiatrists, the Care Quality Commission and NHS England’s national mental health director, Claire Murdoch, have all raised concerns about the quality of the care on offer. In 2019, the Priory group was fined £300,000 over failings that led to the death of a 14-year-old girl, Amy El-Keria. Last week, an inquest jury found that neglect contributed to the death of Matthew Caseby in another Priory facility. But there needs to be a longer answer too – one that addresses the underlying question of why, with average profit margins of 15%-20%, it has been made so easy to make money out of acute psychological distress. Also, whether the health and care bill that is on its way through parliament will lead to improvements or to further fragmentation, as the British Medical Association has warned that it could. Comparisons of the patient safety records of public and private providers are made difficult by a lack of data. Recent evidence has revealed grave failings in NHS hospitals too. But one doesn’t have to pretend that all is well in the public sector to reject as shameful the situation whereby businesses are enabled to make huge profits from delivering substandard care with weak oversight and minimal accountability. Patients and their families deserve better.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on mental health privatisation: unsafe spaces | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/25/the-guardian-view-on-mental-health-privatisation-unsafe-spaces
4/26/2022,"On the fourth and final day of the cross-examination of Johnny Depp in his defamation case against former wife Amber Heard, jurors were presented with audio recording in which the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise actor appeared to warn Heard of violence if their arguments escalated. “The next move, if I don’t walk away … it’s going to be a bloodbath, like it was on the island,” Depp said on the recording played in court. The 58-year-old actor could also be discerned shouting “Shut up, fat a**” after Heard told him to “put your cigarettes out on someone else! You f***ing have consequences for your actions!” But in other exchanges in the Alexandria, Virginia, courtroom on Monday, Depp wrote to his former wife’s mother describing himself as a “poor old junkie” who depended on his wife and her family. “What you do need to know [is] that your daughter has risen far above the nightmarish task of taking care of this poor old junkie. Never a second has gone by that she didn’t look out for me, to have her eyes on me to make sure that I was OK,” he wrote, the court heard. “She has the strength of a thousand men,” Depp added in the note. The exchange came close to the end of Heard’s attorneys’ opportunity, with Depp on the witness stand, to paint the actor as a violent domestic abuser whose behavior was integral to dependencies on drugs and alcohol. The actor has described the accusations of substance abuse as “grossly embellished” and argued it was Heard who escalated their fights to violence. In one recording, Depp and Heard could be heard negotiating time-outs to their disputes, with Heard saying she could not trust her husband to resume their discussions. “How I can I trust you that it will be a few minutes when you’ve done this in the past and disappeared for hours,” Heard says. “In arguments you tend to throw punches,” Depp says. “I’m talking arguments, not the times when it’s physical,” Heard responds. Yout take off right away. You dont deal with the issue. You don’t deal with the confrontation. You split.” “How I can I trust you, Johnny? You split. Under questioning from his own lawyers, Depp was asked how he felt about the article Heard wrote for the Washington Post describing herself as a “public figure representing domestic abuse” two years after she’d been granted a restraining order against him for throwing a cell phone. “At that point it had been a good two solid years since the allegations had been planted firmly on my back,” Depp testified. “I couldn’t believe it … it was clear that, the more hit pieces came out on me, it was clear that Ms Heard’s righteous chase against me was continuing.” “Something had to be done,” he said, referring to bringing the defamation complaint in Virginia. “I couldn’t take it anymore.” Depp said he felt he had no opportunity to address the allegations against him, and by then Disney had dropped him from the Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise. “It hurt, like somebody hit me in the head with a two-by-four. Even if I tried to do an interview to explain myself, it turned into a hit piece.” But Heard’s attorney, Ben Rottenborn, showed Depp negative news articles he said would show that the actor’s bad press preceded the 2018 Washington Post article at the center of the case. “I’ve been in the racket of Hollywood since 1984 … of course people write negative stories,” Depp countered. Depp also explained that his texts to Paul Bettany in which he’d suggested drowning and burning his wife were references to a Monty Python sketch. The actor told the jury that when he used the term “monster” it was his term to describe himself when he’d relapsed out of addiction recovery, or failed to attain sobriety. In his arguments with Heard, he said that when the tenor of the exchanges was reduced to scream obscenities, “the monster was just, for me, was a guy who’s dumb enough to take part in arguments that would ultimately went nowhere.” For both plaintiff and defendant, much of the legal trail has been about establishing probability that their account makes the alleged defamation seem more feasible or unlikely. Much of what has been heard is not directly relevant to the alleged libel but offered as background that could ultimately decide the fate and the reputations of the parties.

4/26/2022,"Five months after special administrators were appointed at Bulb in an act of quasi-nationalisation, the government is discovering a few truths that should have been obvious on day one. There isn’t a long queue of would-be buyers willing to pay good money for a failed energy supplier with 1.7 million customers when wholesale markets are still in turmoil. Taxpayers’ financial exposure is only increasing with every passing month. And semi-state ownership brings some level of ministerial responsibility for how the business is run, including the inexplicable decision to continue paying Hayden Wood, cofounder and chief executive, his £250,000 salary as if nothing had happened. “We do not want this company to be in this temporary state longer than is absolutely necessary,” Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, told parliament last November when announcing the administration. The initial advance of £1.7bn of public money was intended to cover Bulb’s working capital requirements for six months, which seemed to be the soft deadline for getting rid of the problem. That deadline is unlikely to be met, though a summer exit is still possible. However, neither interested party named by the Sunday Times can be regarded as unproblematic. Passing Bulb to Centrica, the owner of British Gas, would entrench the market leader’s dominance and, even in an emergency that has demonstrated the benefit of having well-capitalised suppliers that don’t fall over, ministers are still supposed to have half an eye on long-term competition. The other reported runner is Masdar, out of Abu Dhabi, which offers no experience of the UK retail energy market. Other parties could still emerge, but the burning question is whether a “sale” of Bulb would merit the term. Centrica is said to want taxpayer support for an unknown period to cover the cost of buying energy for Bulb’s customers, a demand that seems entirely sensible on its part. Current wholesale prices equate to £1,000 above today’s price cap. If the difference means losses for Centrica, its shareholders surely wouldn’t tolerate a deal without a dowry. The government’s plan B, one assumes, is a break-up of Bulb, with the customers parcelled out around the current main players. That process would be fiddly, but Kwarteng would be wise not to dismiss it; it may be needed to clear a developing political headache. In the meantime, he should ask if the public purse is getting value from the administrator, Teneo. Handing bonuses to staff to prevent a wave of resignations is theoretically defensible, but where’s the evidence that Bulb was in danger of imploding? As for Wood’s generous retainer, there is no justification. Calls for a shareholder rebellion at Just Eat Takeaway (JET) are in order for the reasons outlined here last week. This is the delivery company that over-ordered in destructive fashion for its investors: it attempted to consume Grubhub of the US before it had digested the merger of Takeaway.com of the Netherlands and Just Eat of the UK. The shares have fallen 75% since the $7.3bn (£5.7bn) Grubhub deal was unveiled in June 2020. So, yes, Cat Rock Capital, with a 6.9% stake, is right to demand a clear-out of the supervisory board that has overseen the calamity. But, among the executives, it feels perverse to target the finance boss, Brent Wissink, while slapping an “abstain” recommendation on the chief executive, Jitse Groen. The argument seems to be the idea that Grubhub was a “capital allocation mistake”, but, if so, the mistake was primarily Groen’s. He is the founder of the business, the architect of the rapid acquisition strategy and the person who publicly defended the Grubhub deal. Groen’s stake is as large as Cat Rock’s, which makes him harder to oust; and separating him from his loyal number-counter may send a useful corrective message. Ultimately, though, JET is Groen’s creation and he’s the man who should be in the spotlight. Even before Elon Musk’s $44bn purchase of Twitter was confirmed on Monday evening, one could say that the board’s devious “poison pill” defence was a waste of time. A threat to flood the market with discounted shares advertised weakness because it suggested the directors couldn’t assemble a decent argument based on creating more value independently. Far from buying time, the move seems only to have encouraged Twitter’s major shareholders to lobby the board to get to the negotiating table. In the process, Musk has avoided scrutiny over how he would run Twitter, which is the core issue for anyone who cares about the quality of public discourse. The poison pill was a self-defeating distraction.",News/Business,The only easy decision for Bulb’s future: stop paying its CEO,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/apr/25/the-only-easy-decision-for-bulbs-future-stop-paying-its-ceo
4/26/2022,"The UK’s top civil servant has privately warned Boris Johnson against forcing government workers back to the office amid growing anger in Whitehall over “scare tactics”, the Guardian has learned. Alongside Simon Case, at least four permanent secretaries – the most senior civil servants in their department – are also understood to have raised alarm over government rhetoric designed to reverse the shift to working-from-home arrangements during the Covid pandemic. Spot checks on office working by Jacob Rees-Mogg, including “sorry you were out when I visited” notes left on empty Whitehall desks, have seen the Cabinet Office minister branded “the milk monitor” by disgruntled officials. Case told the prime minister over the weekend that Rees-Mogg’s strategy was unwise and that the language against civil servants was going too far. A No 10 source said Case was fully on board with a return to more face-to-face working. On Monday No 10 backed Rees-Mogg’s approach amid a rift with Nadine Dorries over the office working drive, which the culture secretary had labelled “Dickensian”. Rees-Mogg had written to cabinet ministers urging them to coerce staff into a “rapid return to the office” and has been leaving notes for absent civil servants with the message: “I look forward to seeing you in the office very soon.” Among the rooms where he left calling cards was the national security secretariat in the Cabinet Office, causing particular disquiet in Whitehall because staff were under intense pressure in that unit, where they work on sensitive material. A government source said Rees-Mogg often had to move through other departments to get to his office at 100 Parliament Street, adding: “He is wholly focused on parts of the government under his control, not other ministers’ areas.” The minister, who is responsible for government efficiencies, presented figures to cabinet last week showing that some government departments were using 25% of office capacity in early April. Dorries’ Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) was at 43%. Rees-Mogg is understood to have done walkabouts at several government offices, including DCMS. During a visit to the Treasury, the Guardian was told he commented to one official that “you’re the first person I’ve seen working on this floor today”. He also visited the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and was unimpressed with the amount of empty desks so sent senior its officials a letter asking when they were going to shut the office given its apparent lack of use, sources said. But the Guardian understands the “threat” not to renew the lease has been abandoned. It was derided as a “scare tactic” to force teams across the government estate to justify using their space. A government source said: “The SFO have had a short-term reprieve and had their long-term requests for renewal denied by two separate ministers.” Several permanent secretaries have also privately voiced frustrations at Rees-Mogg’s “stunt”. An official working at one of Whitehall’s biggest departments said their director of communications had advised: “ignore him”. Another Whitehall source said civil service managers had promoted flexible working, with the expectation of spending one to two days a week in the office. On the civil service jobs site on Monday, more than 1,600 jobs were advertised as having flexible working arrangements. The disquiet at Rees-Mogg’s strategy also extends to ministers. One said: “I’m on team Nadine [Dorries] on this one. Who dreams this crap up? If the civil service aren’t working properly, reform them. Don’t wander round placing the physical equivalent of eye rolls on their desks.” Another Whitehall official said the push was creating a sense of injustice and warned that, coupled with a pay freeze, it would affect staff retention leading to “the worst brain drain I have ever seen”, with talented younger staff seeking to leave. They also pointed to the treatment of junior staff in No 10 and the Cabinet Office over the Partygate scandal, where civil servants have received or expect to receive fines for attending events with the prime minister or senior bosses. Dave Penman, general secretary of the civil service union FDA, said: “I am getting lots from members saying they have had enough and they are going to go. They are not going to be treated like this. “Ultimately civil servants will put up with what’s going on with cost of living and a significantly below inflation pay rise – but not this. It is so demoralising for civil servants because it’s not actually based on anything to do with their work and the best way to deliver public services.” A government spokesperson said: “There is total agreement across government on there being clear benefits from face-to-face, collaborative working and we know that this is particularly important for the learning and development of new and junior members of staff. The minister for Brexit opportunities and government efficiency has written to departments to underline the importance of workplace attendance and request that they review their existing guidance on the minimum number of days staff work in the office.” Asked if Johnson backed Rees-Mogg’s policy of leaving calling cards at vacant desks, the spokesperson said: “What the minister is seeking to achieve is to do everything possible to get the civil service to return to the pre-pandemic level … That is supported by the cabinet secretary and obviously the prime minister.” Referring to the notes left on desks, Johnson “supports any initiative that encourages people to return to pre-pandemic working”, the spokesperson said. “We are not talking about putting an end to flexible working, which continues to have a place in the modern workplace, we are talking about returning to pre-pandemic use of taxpayer-funded departmental buildings.”",News/Politics,Civil service head warns PM against forcing Whitehall workers back to office,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/25/civil-service-head-warns-pm-against-forcing-whitehall-workers-back-to-office
4/26/2022,"The UK national security adviser, Sir Stephen Lovegrove, has said he did not consult Downing Street before telling the Foreign Office it should allow staff from an animal charity to be listed for evacuation from Afghanistan, but said he has “a far from perfect memory” of precisely what happened. The foreign affairs select committee is investigating leaked emails from Foreign Office staff that say Lovegrove directed that the Nowzad staff be evacuated after consulting No 10 last August. Downing Street had previously insisted Boris Johnson and his wife, Carrie, did not intervene on behalf of their friend Pen Farthing, the charity’s founder, to airlift dogs out of Kabul while people died. The decision caused huge media controversy at the time, but Johnson said it was nonsense to suggest he intervened. Lovegrove told the committee on Monday that the Foreign Office leaked email was based on a plausible but incorrect assumption that he had consulted No 10. He said he acted after the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, tweeted at 1.15am on 25 August saying: “Now that Pen Farthing’s Nowzad staff have been cleared to come forward, I have authorised MoD to facilitate their processing.” Lovegrove said the issue was raised at a meeting at 10am that day and he checked with his national security secretariat whether the Nowzad staff were eligible by being on the “leave outside the rules” list, comprising deserving cases that did not meet other criteria. He told the committee he could not precisely remember with whom he checked “in a very complex and fraught environment”, but said he would have remembered if he had checked with either the prime minister or the defence secretary. Lovegrove said he did not know why Wallace posted the tweet, but he said it must have been due to a decision being relayed to him by Permanent Joint Headquarters, the military command. Wallace himself has said he received no instruction from No 10. Lovegrove said one of three cabinet ministers would have approved Nowzad staff being included on the “leave outside the rules” list on 21 August. Emails released by the foreign affairs committee cited an official in the office of Zac Goldsmith, a Foreign Office minister and close friend of Carrie Johnson, telling an official in his department that “the PM has just authorised their staff and animals to be evacuated”. That official later sent another message to other civil servants saying: “Having regard to the prime minister’s Nowzad decision, the foreign secretary might consider the [details redacted] vets and their dependents should be included. They might be able to get to the airport with their dependents in time.”",News/World news,Security chief denies consulting No 10 over Afghanistan charity evacuation,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/25/security-chief-denies-consulting-no-10-over-afghanistan-charity-evacuation
4/26/2022,"A senior barrister who repeated discredited police allegations about the behaviour of Liverpool supporters at the Hillsborough disaster has been cleared of misconduct by his profession’s Bar Standards Board (BSB). Jonathan Goldberg QC made his remarks last May in a BBC interview after the collapse of the final Hillsborough-related criminal trial, claiming that late-arriving Liverpool supporters had caused “a riot” at the 1989 FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough, and crushed “innocents” who had arrived early. Goldberg also made a speech outside the court, where he had represented Peter Metcalf, the then South Yorkshire police solicitor, who was acquitted of perverting the course of justice for advising that dozens of police officers’ written accounts should be amended. Goldberg described the prosecution of Metcalf and two former South Yorkshire police officers as “a witch-hunt”, and said the money spent on criminal investigations into the disaster and its aftermath “would have been better spent on building new hospitals or schools, perhaps in Liverpool”. Many relatives of the 97 men, women and children killed at Hillsborough, and the mayors of Liverpool city region and Greater Manchester, Steve Rotheram and Andy Burnham, complained to the BSB about Goldberg’s remarks. The evidence of South Yorkshire police officers, accusing Liverpool supporters of drunkenness and blaming them for the disaster, has been repeatedly rejected: by Lord Justice Taylor in his 1989 public inquiry; by the Hillsborough Independent Panel in 2012; by three senior judges, including the lord chief justice, when they quashed the first inquest in 2012; and by the jury at the 2014-16 inquest. The BSB decided, however, that Goldberg had not breached the professional standards expected of barristers, and said it remained “reasonable”, protected as a matter of free speech, for somebody “in good faith” to repeat the original police allegations. Bereaved families, survivors and supporters fought through three decades to disprove the police allegations, and against the 1991 first inquest verdict of accidental death. The new inquest jury determined in 2016 that the then 96 victims were all unlawfully killed due to gross negligence manslaughter by David Duckenfield, the South Yorkshire police officer in command at Hillsborough. Having heard the police allegations against the supporters extensively, the jury fully rejected them, and determined that no behaviour of Liverpool supporters contributed to the disaster. Duckenfield was acquitted of gross negligence manslaughter in 2019, after a trial at which his barrister again highlighted allegations of misbehaviour against supporters. Goldberg said in his BBC interview that Liverpool fans’ behaviour was “perfectly appalling on the day, causing a riot”, and that those people, let in by police through an exit gate at 2:52pm, “crushed to death … complete innocents, who were at the front of the [terrace] pens, who had arrived early and were not drunk and were behaving perfectly well”. Although some police officers originally propounded that narrative, that the people who died were all in the ground early, the 2016 inquest found by tracking their movements that 30 of the 96 had themselves come through the exit gate at 2:52pm. However, in its decision clearing Goldberg, the BSB said it was “reasonable” for him to repeat the police case, even though there remains “significant controversy” about it, and that the right of free speech allows somebody to criticise legal findings. “The [BSB] panel were of the view that it cannot be said, especially in light of the contemporaneous police accounts, that no reasonable person in the position of Mr Goldberg can in good faith have formed the view that he expressed.” Margaret Aspinall, whose son James, 18, died at Hillsborough, said families and survivors had fought for 30 years and “the truth has been proved”. “But it’s no surprise that they cleared him because as we’ve found, the establishment protects its own,” she said. Goldberg declined to retract his remarks or apologise after the uproar last year, instead issuing a “clarification”, saying he had not intended to express those views as his own, and was not endorsing the police case. The BSB said that they did not make any finding on that, because they had decided that Goldberg was entitled to express that view anyway.",Sport/Football,Bar Standards Board clears barrister over Hillsborough remarks,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/25/bar-standards-board-clears-barrister-over-hillsborough-remarks
4/26/2022,"The main private mental health hospital chains that treat NHS patients have been criticised by coroners and inquest juries dozens of times over the last decade for providing unsafe care. The Priory, Cygnet and Elysium have been censured at least 37 times for mistakes and lapses in care that were involved in the deaths of patients, including several children. After hearing evidence in court, coroners or inquest juries have identified serious failings in the care given to 23 patients who died while being treated at a Priory hospital since 2012, 11 who were in a Cygnet facility and three who were residents in an Elysium unit. They have found the same mistakes happening again and again at private units. Key failings have included staff not observing potentially suicidal patients properly, ignoring relatives’ concerns about the danger of suicide, and wrongly assessing that risk. The Guardian disclosed on Sunday that the three firms earn more than half of the £2bn a year that the NHS in England now spends outsourcing mental health care because it has too few beds. Deborah Coles, the director of the charity Inquest, which monitors the deaths of people while mental health inpatients, said: “The same basic failings are leading to preventable deaths of men, women and children. Persistent issues including with risk assessments, observations, ligature points and communication amongst staff or with families are costing lives. “For years inspections, inquests and investigations have repeatedly exposed neglect and harmful practices. Yet the NHS continues to commission these providers, at significant public expense.” In some cases the coroner has been so concerned by the evidence they have heard that they have issued a prevention of future deaths (PFD) notice – a legal warning to a public or private entity to make urgent changes to reduce the risk of someone else dying in the same circumstances. On Monday Louise Hunt, the senior coroner for Birmingham, issued a PFD ordering the Priory to make a series of changes following the death in September 2020 of 23-year-old Matthew Caseby, who died after absconding over a fence at the back of its hospital in Birmingham. The Priory had taken no action despite a previous absconsion over the same fence in October 2019. Hunt also advised the Department of Health and Social Care to bring in national guidelines for the height of perimeter fences and security in the outside areas of acute mental health units. Last month an inquest jury found that 17-year-old Chelsea Blue Mooney had died in April 2021 “as a result of insufficient care, crucially inadequate observations and the delays in emergency response” at the Cygnet hospital in Sheffield. Last November, at the inquest into the death in 2019 of 16-year-old Nadia Shah at the Potters Bar Clinic in Hertfordshire run by Elysium, the jury found it was due to “misadventure contributed to by the inadequate care at the Potters Bar Clinic”. They cited six specific flaws, including mistakes in observation and “a failure to adequately report observations to properly inform assessment of risk”. It is unknown how many times NHS mental health trusts have been criticised by coroners or juries over the same period. However, in 2019 the Care Quality Commission, the NHS watchdog, said there was a “disparity in performance” on safety between private and NHS mental health units. The Priory said that the figures for the 23 occasions on which it has been censured by a coroner or inquest were “misleading and presented without any context”. It added: “Priory, as the UK’s largest independent mental health provider, has safely and successfully treated tens of thousands of patients over the last 10 years, as a trusted partner to the NHS. Deaths are extremely rare.” A Cygnet spokesperson said: “Any incident in which a service user has died is heartbreaking for everyone involved. Care for people with mental health conditions is challenging and our staff work incredibly hard to ensure the safety and wellbeing of those in our care.” Cygnet learns lessons from every death to prevent further fatalities, they added. In a statement Elysium said: “Over the last six years, tragically a small number of deaths have occurred in our high acuity services and our thoughts remain with each affected family. On the occasions when inquests into these deaths have made important recommendations we have acted swiftly and decisively.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

4/26/2022,"Caroline Sharp believed that when her daughter Emma Pring was admitted for treatment at the private Cygnet hospital in Maidstone, it would be a turning point in her daughter’s life. “In some ways it was my naivety, but I really did think she was getting the best care,” Sharp says. During the inquest to establish how and why her daughter died while an inpatient at the hospital, and after hearing the evidence given by the staff, Sharp remembers thinking: “How on earth did I let my daughter go there?” Sharp says her daughter was fundamentally a “lovely, lively, cheeky little girl”. “She was just so lovely to everybody she met,” she says. “And even when she started having her own difficulties, she just had so many friends that she would put over and above herself. I mean, just by looking at her Facebook page, the number of tributes and the number of people who still send her messages now, just really shows how she would always put everybody else first, often to her own detriment.” The difficulties Pring experienced refers to the struggles she had with her mental health, which included depression, borderline personality disorder and PTSD which was triggered when she was raped twice at the age of 18. In April 2016, Pring’s mental health began to further decline and she began to receive care from Sussex partnership NHS trust, left her job as a nursery nurse, and was eventually detained under section 3 of the Mental Health Act. In July 2020, Pring was transferred, by the NHS trust, to the Roseacre ward at Cygnet in Maidstone, for what was meant to be long-term, specialist treatment. As a patient at the hospital, Pring received a type of trauma therapy which involved reliving what happened to her at 18, a therapy which Sharp said her daughter was “terrified” of beginning. In February 2021, although communication to her daughter was limited, Sharp says that a few days before her daughter’s death she told her mother that she wanted her to bring her home. “I said, Ems, you’re under a section 3, I’m not allowed. I can’t just do that.” Pring killed herself on 20 April 2021, aged 29. An inquest into her death, which concluded last month, found it could have been prevented by the hospital, with the jury finding there had been an “insufficient level of observation, and a misjudgment of Emma’s actual risk”. Rather than being placed on one-to-one observations that might have prevented her death, Pring was supposed to have been observed by staff every 15 minutes, a timeframe which the inquest found was not always adhered to. Cygnet’s own “root cause analysis” report found that if Pring had been placed on one-to-one observations it is likely that she would not have died. The coroner is also considering whether to issue a prevention of future deaths notice to Cygnet hospitals. Her daughter’s death has also led Sharp to question why her NHS trust was unable to provide care for mental health patients themselves, rather than contracting beds at private hospitals. “Why aren’t the NHS able to [provide this care] themselves?,” Sharp asks. “Why are there no placements on the NHS? Why are we relying so heavily on private healthcare to provide something like this?’” There have been at least 20 deaths of patients, aside from Pring, at Cygnet hospitals across the UK since 2011. Inquest, which has been tracking these deaths, believes they are concerning. Following the death of 17-year-old Chelsea Blue Mooney at a Cygnet hospital in Sheffield in April 2021, the same month that Pring died, an inquest found that “insufficient care” at the hospital had led to her death. For Sharp, hearing the jury’s conclusion at the inquest, that her daughter’s death could have been prevented and that there were failures at Cygnet hospital was “difficult to process”. “It’s just, really really difficult to come to terms with, and to know, that your daughter was failed by the people that should have been looking after her,” Sharp says. A Cygnet spokesperson said: “We would like to express our deepest condolences to Emma’s family and friends. Our thoughts remain with them. “We take the safety and wellbeing of our service users extremely seriously, and the recommendations from our review have been shared locally and across the organisation to ensure lessons learnt are identified and shared.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

4/26/2022,"The Texas Republican spearheading an extraordinary bipartisan effort to delay Wednesday’s execution of a Mexican American woman amid mounting evidence of her innocence has described the case as “the most troubling I’ve ever seen, possibly the most troubling in the history of our state”. In an interview with the Guardian, Jeff Leach, a Republican member of the Texas House of Representatives, said that even strong supporters of the death penalty – as he once considered himself – had great concern about the rapidly approaching execution. Melissa Lucio, 52, is scheduled to be put to death by lethal injection for killing her two-year-old daughter Mariah, but new scientific evidence suggests the toddler died accidentally after a fall. Leach said that a possibly innocent woman was “about to be – let’s not mince words – murdered by the state”. He said that the numerous missteps made in the prosecution of Lucio had given him “great pause” that was forcing him to reconsider his support of capital punishment. “I’m not ashamed to say I believed in the death penalty for the most heinous cases. But this case is shaking my confidence in the system. It has failed Melissa and the victim of the tragedy, Mariah, at every turn,” he said. The lawmaker had strong words to say about the agonizing wait Lucio is enduring in her final hours before her scheduled execution. “It’s barbaric,” Leach said. “There’s no reason for it. They’ve had all the information they need for weeks – someone just has to step up and make the right decision.” The Republican lawmaker ran through a litany of prosecution failures. He said: “If it was just the interrogation, or just one piece of new scientific evidence, or only one juror and not five who have now said they regret their decision, then we could talk. But when you have all of these things where the system has failed, then that causes great alarm.” Leach’s comments came as Lucio’s battle to save her own life entered its final feverish hours. Her lawyers are fighting on several fronts in the hope of securing a stay of execution. On Monday, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles is meeting to discuss the Lucio case, and its recommendation will then be passed to the Republican governor, Greg Abbott, for his final say. Abbott has the power to put a hold on the execution, grant Lucio clemency or let the process proceed to the death chamber. Legal appeals have also been lodged with a local district court in Cameron county and in the Texas court of criminal appeals in Austin. A new filing on Monday reprised the many inconsistencies in the prosecution case, including evidence that Lucio’s confession was forced and that Mariah died as a result of injuries sustained when she fell down a steep flight of stairs and not at her mother’s hands. Leach has been at the forefront of efforts by Texas lawmakers to persuade the authorities to postpone the execution. He orchestrated a letter to the board of pardons signed by 80 House members, 32 of whom are Republican. A similar letter has been sent by 20 Texas senators, eight Republican. In the House letter, the lawmakers pointed out that Lucio was treated by prosecutors in a completely different way from her husband, who was also responsible for Mariah’s care. Lucio had no previous history of violence and her children said she had never been abusive towards them; by contract her husband had a history of assault yet is now a free man having only served a four-year sentence for child endangerment. The exceptional degree of bipartisan agreement, with more than half the legislature backing calls for a stay, is extremely rare in such a riven state. Leach, however, said he was unsurprised. “I know our country is pretty divided, and we have our fights,” he said. “But when something is as clear as this, I know my legislative colleagues on both sides of the aisle are willing to do the right thing.” Leach was one of several Texas lawmakers who visited Lucio earlier this month in the Mountain View Unit in Gatesville where the women’s death row is housed. He told the Guardian that they prayed together and he held her hand. “Her faith is incredibly strong. She is comforted by the prayers of millions across the world, so it was an amazing moment.” At the encounter, Lucio invited Leach to attend her execution on Wednesday should it go ahead. “If it does go forward, I will be there,” he said. “But I’m hoping that’s a trip I don’t have to make.”",News/US news,Texas Republican urges halt to ‘most troubling’ Melissa Lucio execution,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/25/melissa-lucio-execution-jeff-leach-opposition-republican
4/26/2022,"The UK government has defended a decision to pay millions of pounds in bonuses to staff at the collapsed energy supplier Bulb, despite the fact that it has been effectively nationalised as part of a bailout that could cost taxpayers £2.2bn. Quarterly “retention bonuses” were deemed necessary to prevent an exodus of staff that could have scuppered efforts to keep the business afloat while a buyer is found, multiple sources familiar with the situation said. “The alternative is that hundreds of people leave and you won’t be able to sell it,” one Whitehall source said. “You can’t provide energy to people if there’s nobody working at the company.” Bulb Energy, which has more than 1.5 million customers, is currently run by the consultancy Teneo, appointed under the “special administration” scheme after the energy supplier became the largest of more than 20 to collapse under the weight of sky-high energy prices. The arrangement is the first test for a system designed to kick in when an energy supplier is too big for its customers to be transferred immediately to a rival. Under the arrangement, a court appointed Teneo to run the day-to-day operations on behalf of the government, which is funding the costs. The financial advisory firm Interpath has been drafted in to run Bulb’s parent company, Simple Energy. The decision to pay quarterly bonuses, first reported by the Financial Times, is understood to rest with Interpath because payroll is managed through Simple Energy. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “Bulb’s administrators have set up an employee retention scheme in order to maintain operational effectiveness and support to customers. “The special administrator of Bulb remains legally obligated to keep costs of the administration process as low as possible – which the employee retention scheme is consistent with. “The government will seek to recoup costs at a later date, ensuring that we get maximum value for money for taxpayers.” The cost of running Bulb could reach £2.2bn, the Office for Budget Responsibility has said, while some reports have suggested £3bn is not unrealistic. A government source insisted that costs had not yet reached the £1.7bn initially set aside. The cost includes a heavily criticised £250,000 salary for Bulb’s boss and co-founder Hayden Wood, who has apologised for the company’s demise. A spokesperson for Interpath said: “The teams at Simple and Bulb have worked incredibly hard since the companies entered insolvency last November, ensuring the businesses have been able to continue to trade, and providing continuity of service for 1.5 million customers, and all against the backdrop of personal uncertainty that any administration inevitably causes.” The British Gas owner, Centrica, and the Abu Dhabi-based renewable energy firm Masdar are understood to be the frontrunners to buy Bulb Energy, with the government hoping that the investment bank Lazard can find a buyer by June. A further four parties have expressed interest, according to a Whitehall source, and could be called upon if Centrica and Masdar drop out.",News/Business,UK government defends bonuses paid to staff of collapsed firm Bulb,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/25/uk-government-defends-bonuses-paid-to-staff-of-collapsed-firm-bulb-energy
4/26/2022,"Priti Patel’s refugee pushback policy has been officially withdrawn by the government days before a judicial review of the tactic was due to be heard in the high court. The government’s legal department acknowledged in a letter on Sunday that the plan to try to force people in dinghies back to France has been abandoned after Boris Johnson’s announcement that the Royal Navy would take over operations in the Channel. Patel’s officials last week received notification that the Ministry of Defence, which is now in charge of picking up refugees in the Channel, did not have permission to use the tactic, the letter said. The policy, which was finalised in the autumn by the Home Office, authorised and encouraged Border Force officials to stop migrant vessels in UK waters and forcibly redirect them to return to France. In January, Patel said pushing back boats was “absolutely still policy” when she gave evidence to the House of Lords justice and home affairs committee. In its letter, the legal department said the policy and procedures had been withdrawn and that the MoD joint commander had not had permission to authorise the use of turnaround tactics. The letter, which was signed on behalf of the solicitor general, said a “significant development” had meant the case would no longer proceed. “That development flowed from the prime minister’s announcement on Thursday 14 April 2022 that the Ministry of Defence was taking over primacy in respect of Channel operations with regard to small boat crossings. As a result of a military order notified to the secretary of state for the home department’s officials earlier on 20 April 2022, the Ministry of Defence joint commander has not had permission to authorise the use of turnaround tactics,” the letter said. It said that if a decision were taken to use turnaround tactics in the future, it would only be after a full consideration of all relevant matters. “The secretary of state for the home department [Patel] has determined that: the policy and procedures, which are the subject of the ongoing litigation, are withdrawn; if a decision were taken to use turnaround tactics in the future, it would only be after a full consideration of all relevant matters, including the evolving nature of the small boats threat, migrant behaviour and organised criminal activity; and new policies, guidance and operational procedures would need to be formulated at that point.” Four organisations – the PCS union, Care4Calais, Channel Rescue and Freedom from Torture – had challenged the Home Office policy, with the applications set down for a three-day hearing on 3 May. The climbdown comes as the nationality and borders bill reaches its final stages in parliament. The Lords has twice rejected parts of the bill that would severely penalise refugees arriving in the UK without visas, in line with their rights under the refugee convention. Patel had repeatedly said there was a legal basis for the pushback policy despite introducing express powers to turn back boats in the nationality and borders bill on the basis that there was no such current legal power. The PCS general secretary, Mark Serwotka, said: “This humiliating climbdown by the government is a stunning victory for Home Office workers and for refugees. There is little doubt that lives have been saved. “The pushbacks manoeuvre is extremely dangerous and represents a clear risk to life and limb. We were simply not prepared to allow our members to be placed in this horrendous position.” Clare Moseley, the founder of Care4Calais, said: “I find it hard to believe that anyone within government thought that performing pushbacks in the Channel was a viable policy.” Sonya Sceats, the chief executive of Freedom from Torture, said: “This momentous climbdown by the government shows that change is possible when we come together. “But we should never have had to take this government to court in order to defend the sanctity of life – it is scandalous that it reached this point.” Steven Martin of Channel Rescue said: “Pushbacks are a reckless endangerment to life and we have always maintained and reminded the government that they are unlawful. The violent forcing back of people seeking protection is abhorrent and deprives them of their right to asylum.” The Guardian disclosed on Friday that unpublished parts of the proposed pushback policy said the tactic would not be used against asylum seekers. A government spokesperson said similar tactics might be deployed in the future, however these would only be used after full consideration of all relevant factors.“It is right that we consider all safe and legal options to stop these unnecessary journeys, including turning boats around.“As we have set out previously, this tactic fully complies with both domestic and international law, however, there are extremely limited circumstances when you can safely turn boats back in the Channel.”",News/UK news,Priti Patel’s refugee pushback policy withdrawn days before legal review,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/25/uk-refugee-pushback-policy-withdrawn-judicial-review-priti-patel
4/26/2022,"A Turkish court has sentenced a leading philanthropist to life imprisonment after finding him guilty of “attempting to overthrow the government by force” in connection with the Gezi Park anti-government protests in 2013. Osman Kavala, 64, has been held since October 2017 on accusations of financing the protests which began as small demonstrations in an Istanbul park and snowballed into nationwide anti-government unrest. The court also handed out 18-year sentences to seven activists accused of assisting Kavala, ordering the immediate arrest of Mücella Yapıcı, Çiğdem Mater, Hakan Altınay, Mine Özerden, Can Atalay, Yiğit Ali Ekmekçi and Tayfun Kahraman. The courtroom, packed and overheated with fearful and exhausted observers, reportedly erupted with protest chants including “long live freedom, down with tyranny” on hearing the verdict. “We will not bow to persecution,” yelled Atalay on hearing his sentence. The sentencing marks Turkish authorities’ deepest and most public crackdown on dissent and freedom of assembly in the past decade and threatens to damage Turkish relations with Europe after heavy criticism of the marathon trial. Amnesty International called the decision “a travesty of justice”, calling the trial “a politically motivated charade”. “It’s a horrifying decision, and not one that was in any way expected,” said Emma Sinclair-Webb, Turkey director of Human Rights Watch, speaking from outside the courtroom. “This entire process from start to finish has been a show trial.” The draconian sentences, which defendants and observers claim was based on flimsy evidence, follow criticisms that the trial has been subject to political interference. “It’s completely in defiance of Turkey’s obligations to international law,” said Webb. “This case is emblematic, it’s exposed the human rights in the country as being in complete crisis – it shows that the presidency can do what it wants to people. It’s an act of utter defiance against the international order as well.” Kavala appeared in court via video link from Silivri high security prison on the outskirts of Istanbul. “I consider peaceful protests aiming to prevent government initiatives that are not in public interest as legitimate civil society activities and a requirement of democracy,” he said. “After losing four and a half years of my life, the only aspect I can find solace in is the possibility that what I experienced could contribute to confronting the crucial problems in the judiciary of Turkey, and so those tried in future could receive better treatment.” Small protests against an urban development plan in Istanbul’s Gezi Park that began in 2013 quickly transformed into huge anti-government protests. A fierce response by the authorities was followed by years-long attacks on anyone accused of aiding or organising the protest movement. Kavala was accused of financing the protests after he paid for a folding table and some snacks for protesters, and arrested in the Istanbul airport in 2017. He was later acquitted of all charges in 2020, but quickly rearrested before he could return home. He was later charged with espionage, and alleged involvement in a 2016 attempted coup. Kavala has frequently been singled out for criticism by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who accuses the Paris-born philanthropist of connections to the Hungarian-American investor George Soros. Last October, Turkey declared 10 western ambassadors, including those from the US, Germany and France, “persona non grata”, after they issued a statement condemning Kavala’s continued detention, before later reversing the decision. The trial was repeatedly condemned as unjust and politically motivated by rights groups as well as the Council of Europe, whose ministers took the highly unusual decision earlier this year to formally begin the process of accusing Turkey of infringement, after Turkish authorities refused to release Kavala after a ruling by the European court of human rights. “It is regrettable that the Turkish authorities have refused to execute the respective ECHR’s ruling. Such attitude sets a worrying precedent and further increases the EU’s concerns regarding Turkish judiciary’s adherence to international and European standards,” they said. Kavala, Yapıcı and their co-defendants remained defiant in court throughout the sentencing, and are expected to appeal. “It is evident that those who issued the indictment did not feel constrained by laws, considering that they will receive political support as they intended to prolong my detention at all costs,” said Kavala.",News/World news,Philanthropist sentenced to life in Turkey in ‘travesty’ trial over Gezi Park protests,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/25/philanthropist-sentenced-to-life-in-turkey-in-travesty-trial-over-gezi-park-protests
4/26/2022,"The UK has supplied £200m of military aid to Ukraine, the defence secretary has said, as he confirmed Britain would send a “small number” of Stormer missile launchers to Ukraine and offer a deployment of Challenger 2 tanks to Poland. In a statement to MPs, Ben Wallace said gifts of weapons by Britain could eventually total £500m, and he said 15,000 Russian soldiers had died since the invasion began on 24 February. “We have gifted in aid £200m which we propose will grow to £500m to Ukraine,” Wallace told the House of Commons. Replacement equipment would be paid for by the Treasury on an “old for new” basis, the minister said. The objective of British military support should be to help ensure Ukraine “gets to chose where it wishes to settle for peace”, Wallace said, but he added that in his view Russia should be forced out of the entire country, back to its pre-2014 border. “I want Putin not only beyond the pre-February boundaries. He invaded Crimea illegally, he invaded Donetsk illegally and he should comply with international law and in the long run leave Ukraine,” Wallace said. Britain is one of the largest suppliers in Europe of arms to Ukraine, running down its stocks of weapons to keep Kyiv’s forces supplied. But its supplies are dwarfed by those of the US, which has provided $3.7bn of military aid since Russia invaded. Stormer armoured vehicles carry Starstreak laser-guided anti-aircraft missiles and are designed to provide a roving threat to Russian jets and helicopters. On the tanks, Wallace’s language suggested a firming up of plans first floated by Boris Johnson on Friday when he said the UK was “looking at” sending British Challenger 2s to Poland so that Warsaw could in turn send Ukraine more T-72 tanks, the Russian design used by its armed forces. Wallace told MPs: “We’re also offering a deployment of British Challenger tanks to Poland to bridge the gap between Poland donating tanks to Ukraine and their replacement arriving from a third country.” Poland expects to receive the first of 250 US-made Abrams tanks later this year but is willing to send more of its arsenal of T-72s to Ukraine if the UK and other western nations come forward and provide reinforcements now. Earlier this month it was suggested that Poland could donate 100 T-72s to its neighbour, and there have been some reports suggesting some of the Soviet-designed vehicles have already secretly been sent. Wallace indicated that the UK was looking at supplying Brimstone ground-based missiles that could be used to defend Odesa against any seaborne invasion, but he ruled out giving Kyiv the UK’s dated AS90 artillery. Since the beginning of the year the UK has supplied 5,361 NLAW anti-tank bazookas, more than 200 US-made Javelin missiles and 104 Starstreak high-velocity and other low-velocity anti-tank weapons, Wallace said.",News/Politics,"UK military aid to Ukraine could rise to £500m, MPs told",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/25/uk-military-aid-to-ukraine-could-rise-to-500m-mps-told
4/26/2022,"The Queensland police service appears to have balked at substantial reform to the way it handles officers who are accused of domestic violence, after promising to act on a “concerning increase” in the volume of complaints. Last May the assistant commissioner Brian Codd told Guardian Australia that police were “grappling” with how to respond to the increase officer-involved domestic violence, and that reforms were “very much” on the agenda. “You can be a truck driver and you can be subject to a domestic and family violence order and it may not have any impact on your employment or where you sit within society … but we expect and are entitled to more from police officers,” Codd said last year. He said at the time he had met with the Queensland police ethical standards command “to work out a position we might need to take on this”. Asked last week what progress had been made in Queensland, a police spokesperson pointed to changes to the operational procedures manual in July 2021 to “support greater officer accountability and ensure the confidence of the public is maintained while an investigation takes place”. A comparison with the previous operational procedures manual shows the relevant section was updated to require additional paperwork by officers, including ensuring that the “actioning district” submits a briefing note to police ethical standards command for consideration of disciplinary action. “Immediate consideration of the officer’s circumstances, current position, and the level of contact that member may have with members of the public is reviewed on a case-by-case basis,” the police spokesperson said. Officer-involved domestic violence poses a significant problem to authorities; specifically allowing natural justice to a person accused of an offence, or subject to a domestic violence order. At the same time, women’s advocates say it is problematic that a domestic violence victim seeking assistance could theoretically encounter an officer who is subject to a complaint, charge or conviction. Domestic violence now makes up about 40% of calls for police assistance. Victoria has attempted to address the issue by establishing a specialist police unit to investigate complaints against officers. Angela Lynch, a domestic violence protection advocate, said changes to operational procedures in Queensland did not go far enough, and victims needed “confidence their case will be dealt with appropriately”. Lynch said officer-involved domestic violence would be under-reported, and Queensland should have some mechanism where complaints against officers could be made and assessed independent of police. “The community needs confidence that police acknowledge that this is a problem, and that there’s some level of independent oversight,” she said. “There has to be some oversight of the decision-making process. I don’t think the community in the end does have confidence that police can do this themselves. It’s Caesar judging Caesar.” Guardian Australia reported in 2020 that 84 serving police officers had been accused of domestic violence in the previous five years. Police say this rate is “lower than the general public” but evidence suggests officers are “as likely as anyone else” to perpetrate domestic violence. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “On occasion QPS members are subject of domestic and family violence complaint reporting,” a police spokesperson said. “While these particular matters may be lower than the rate of the general public, any report of members suspected of perpetrating domestic and family violence is taken extremely seriously. “Responding to incidents of domestic and family violence is often challenging and complex. “The Queensland police service remains committed to refining and enhancing the police response to DFV, including improving processes for reporting and investigating matters in a timely manner, taking protective action tailored to the needs of the victim and holding perpetrators to account.”",News/Australia news,Queensland police update manual after signalling reforms to how officers accused of domestic violence are handled,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/26/queensland-police-update-procedures-after-promising-to-act-on-officers-accused-of-domestic-violence
4/26/2022,"I’m tempted to start this column by writing: a well-made garment can be elusive, but we all know it when we see it. Unfortunately, I think saying so is about as helpful as the advice, “you do you”. The reality is, the quality of our clothes has been in steady decline since the late 1990s, when fast fashion caused production and consumption to rise and prices to plummet. Despite this, well-made garments do exist, if you know what you’re looking for. Here, in the first of a two-part series, experts explain how to tell if a garment has been made with care and skill before you take it into the fitting room. The owner of vintage consignment store Shop Bruce, Dan Neilsenbeck, says: “The best way to assess the quality of a garment’s construction is to look inside.” When you do this, the first thing you should be checking is if the hem and seams are thoroughly sewn down. According to Max Sanderson, a lecturer in fashion design at Parson’s Paris, a loose hem is easy to snag with a thumb or big toe. Next, Sanderson says to examine the stitching. He looks for small stitches because they’re more durable than long ones which are a giveaway that a garment has been made quickly. Finally, he inspects the whole thing for flaws to be sure there are no threads coming undone or obvious signs it has been damaged or pulled. The tags inside the garment will tell you where the garment was made, what its fabric composition is and how to care for it – key things when deciding if something is going to suit your needs. For instance, if you are looking for something to wear on a day-to-day basis, you likely want to steer clear of garments labelled hand wash or dry clean only. Similarly, the fabric composition tells you how the garment will wear. Anything made of a protein fibre like wool will keep you warm when it’s cold but will also breathe if you get hot. It also has a waxy coating, so it doesn’t need to be washed frequently and is resistant to wrinkles, so it is good for travelling. Fibres made from plant matter like cotton, linen or viscose rayon are breathable but won’t keep you as warm. They are easy to wash making them great to wear close to the body, but crease easily. Synthetic fibres like polyester or nylon are trickier. They don’t breathe and trap body odour so if you are wearing them against your skin, you may notice they cause you to sweat and smell. But Sanderson says synthetics can be necessary for performance requirements like waterproof or windproof jackets and athletic wear. According to Neilsenbeck: “High quality fabric will feel better on your skin and generally fit, drape and wear better.” To judge the quality of a garment’s fabric, you need to get a sense of the fabric’s hand, or how it feels. To test this, designer Bianca Spender pulls the fabric between her thumbs to see if it stretches or holds its form then she will gently rub it to see if it pills. Sanderson recommends rubbing the fabric against a part of your body that’s more sensitive than the palm of your hand, like the side of your neck or forearm, where the skin is more delicate. While it may have been true 20 years ago that a made in Italy tag indicated a superior level of craftsmanship and quality, that’s not necessarily the case now. Knowledge and expertise vary widely across factories and within countries, and some of the most advanced technology and skilled workforces are in China and other parts of the global south. But there are some other things to consider based on where something is made, like environmental protections and labour laws. Spender says: “You should always be asking yourself the question does the price of the clothing reflect the work that goes into it.” Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning A more technical way of judging the care and attention that went into making something are the seams. Spender says she “will always check to see if the seams are bubbling and whether the side seam is hanging straight, to check the fabric isn’t off grain”. If a garment is made of a patterned fabric, Neilsenbeck says to make sure the patterns are matched along the seams. The finish of a seam on the inside of a garment can tell you a lot about the time and care that went into making it. A good rule of thumb is that there should be no raw edges. One way of covering raw edges is to overlock the seam. Overlocking is a type of stitch that goes right to the edge of the cloth and runs in tight, zigzag lines from the edge to about half a centimetre in. According to Sanderson, an overlocked seam is the fastest way to make a garment and can be more fragile. But in certain things like jersey T-shirts or jumpers, this isn’t necessarily a problem. “It’s all about the right finishes for the right materials,” Spender says. Generally speaking, better quality garments will have bound seams, so that the raw edge of the fabric is covered. Or flat-felled seams where there are no exposed edges, so the fabric has been folded twice and stitched along both sides. A French seam is similar to this but is less visible and usually used for high end, sheer garments.

4/26/2022,"Australian voters who chose their preferred candidate before the election was called have saved time. The campaign’s policy vacuum has hardly informed voting choices, with both major parties eschewing what the former US president George Bush Sr termed the “vision thing”. Whether or not politicians, irrespective of ideological colour, have the stomach for them, important and urgent economic challenges lie ahead. Household living standards are threatened by rising costs, low wage growth, poor quality of jobs, employment insecurity, higher mortgage repayments and housing unaffordability. Downgrades in 2022 global growth from 4.4% to 3.6% and China’s slowdown, along with its reduced emphasis on infrastructure spending, diversification of commodity suppliers and the antagonistic Sino-Australian relationship, pose risks to an uneven post-pandemic recovery. With China being the world’s factory, its Covid-19 policy may continue to disrupt supply for some time. Longer term, the pandemic and geopolitical realignments may reshape the global economic order. Australia, an open economy dependent on trade and the free flow of capital, is exposed. Rising costs of providing retirement incomes, aged care, and health and disability services will need to be met. With climate change accelerating, even modest restrictions on carbon emissions will impact Australia’s fossil fuel exports. Adaptation to regular extreme weather events and resource scarcity will be expensive. Increases in public and private debt have reduced flexibility to deal with these issues. Major changes in the economic structure are needed. This requires cogent policies for managing volatile commodity incomes, demographics, the labour market, workforce and skills planning, productivity, and regulatory and tax frameworks. Welfare systems need to be redesigned to ensure they assist the disadvantaged. Yet instead of addressing these issues, the 2022 election campaign has deployed familiar tropes. Both major parties have thrown fistfuls of dollars aimed at effectively buying votes. The cost-benefit analysis of many initiatives is dubious. While individually small, a few millions here and there soon add up to serious money. Both sides favour impressive announcements which they cannot or will not implement. During the pandemic and natural disasters, many government programs were difficult to access. Intentional complexity and a lack of resources allocated to processing applications means assistance frequently goes unused. Improvements in the federal budget result from money allocated for programs but not spent. The proclamation of a headline-grabbing scheme substitutes for taking the necessary action. Population growth to underpin economic activity and high property prices is popular with the two-thirds of the population who own real estate. This ignores resource constraints and limits on available land, which is protected from the effects of climate change. Initiatives, especially on defence, run into tens of billions. Voters are meant to be impressed by the sums, incomprehensible to most, even if the project’s merits are unclear. Credit is claimed for positives, irrespective of the claimant’s contribution. Australia’s recovery is driven by factors outside policymakers’ influence – for example, Chinese iron ore and coal demand, high commodity prices and supply disruptions elsewhere. The only direct input has been substantial government spending of other people’s money. Simultaneously, external factors such as the Ukraine conflict – outside Australian control – are blamed for negatives that include rising fuel, energy, food and housing costs. Numbers are manipulated to present favourable outcomes. Budget forecasts have repeatedly underestimated revenues, overestimated outgoings and understated commodity prices to make the actual outcome better and demonstrate competence. For hard issues, inquiries or royal commissions are proposed even though the problems and solutions are already known. If all else fails there is the the belief that something, probably new technology, will turn up, because it always has. Donald Horne’s phrase “the lucky country” is resurrected, ignoring its irony and criticism of a nation lacking imagination and mired in philistinism, provincialism, complacency and its past. While grist for comedians, this policy drift has consequences. Problems become larger and solutions more costly, or they have reduced effectiveness. Future generations are left to deal with the mess. The process encourages societal “cakeism”: keeping your confectionery and eating it. It promotes unrealistic expectations that there are no costs to choices and everyone can have everything when they desire it merely because they demand it. A “looting” mentality sets in. Voters auction their allegiances to the highest bidder under a “what’s-in-it-for-me?” ethos, ignoring the wider costs. Elections should be serious undertakings, when alternative plans and visions on important issues are presented and debated. The 2022 election campaign has, to date, fallen well short of this standard. This exacerbates a lack of voter engagement, a fragmented political process and, ultimately, a loss of trust in democracy itself.

4/26/2022,"Laurena Henschke had been dead about 12 months when a letter from the Australian government turned up at her Adelaide home. “Dear Mrs Henschke,” it read. “You have moved up in the queue and I expect that you will be assigned a home care package in about three months. This package may be lower than the level you are approved for, but it lets you start to receive some home care services.” The letter was a cruel frustration for her husband and carer, Dr Philip Henschke, who had sought, and been approved for, the highest level of home care for Laurena 18 months earlier. “Laurena had two years of relentless decline with what they call a glioblastoma multiforme, which is the A-grade nasty, can’t-beat-it brain tumour,” he told the Guardian. “Life got rough in the last six to nine months.” Henschke and his daughters worked together to care for her. But the demands became significantly more difficult in Laurena’s final stages. Laurena’s balance required two people, one on each side, to get her on to a shower chair or on and off the toilet. “You’ve got to have round the clock staffing, alarms, bed rails and all that sort of thing to cope. But we got by, we bought an electric bed and slept in the room with her, and we saw her into the next life, or off the planet, at home, which was a great blessing.” The letter felt like a parting shot from a system the aged care royal commission would later describe as “unacceptably” delayed. “What frustrated me was that having gone through probate, reporting her death through the state health authorities, cancelling her bank and superannuation accounts, it was quite clear that there was no intersection between them,” Henschke said. Four years have passed since his ordeal. But, with aged care firming as a key battleground before the election, has much changed in home care since? Has access to home care – critical in managing Australia’s ageing population and relieving the strain on residential care – improved since the royal commission last year told the government to act “urgently” to fix waiting lists? Data suggests the kinds of waits Laurena and Philip Henschke faced are still significant, though improving. After the royal commission, the Coalition announced 80,000 new home care packages worth more than $7bn, which are being delivered progressively until 2023. About 30,000 packages have been released so far. Government data shows the time people spend on the waiting list – the time between approval and the availability of care – is coming down gradually. The wait times for the kinds of packages Laurena Henschke was approved for has reduced to an average of six to nine months, down from 12 months or more in 2020. But at the same time the sector has warned of a glaring problem, compromising its ability to deliver support services, even if they have been approved and funded by government. It’s one faced right across aged care: staffing. Earlier this month, the biggest home care provider in the country, myHomecare Group, sounded the alarm, with its chief executive Stuart Miller telling the Guardian its staff were at “breaking point”. Miller estimated his staff turnover was somewhere near 30% in a single year – far better than the sector average, but still an extraordinary and disruptive rate. “The staff turnover in this industry has been nothing short of abysmal,” he said. “We’ve really found that a lot of the workers are leaving earlier certainly than they wanted and finishing their careers full stop just due to the stress of the last two years.” Staffing problems, he said, meant less critical forms of support were being delayed or compromised. “When you’ve got this level of turnover, it really upsets everything, from the clients to the economics of the business itself. It’s been a real struggle for us in the last two years.” Industry peak group, Aged and Community Services Australia, delivered a similar warning. It said the sector had faced “serious workforce shortages and low wages” prior to the pandemic. The pressures of the last two years had made it ever more difficult. “Attracting home care and other aged care workers has become even more difficult through the pressures of the past two years,” Acsa’s chief executive, Paul Sadler, said. It’s an issue that was flagged in no uncertain terms by the royal commission. In its final report last year, the royal commission said it was “not confident that there is adequate capacity to supply all the services that should be funded under a needs-based system”. “It will be necessary for supply-side capacity to be assessed and, where necessary, grown, so that aged care services are available when and where they are needed,” its report said. “This requires detailed planning.” The planning, the royal commission said, would need to ensure “an adequate coverage of services to meet the population needs for major cities, rural, regional, and remote Australia”, as well as ensuring “the capacity and capability of new and existing providers to deliver more aged care services”. The aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, said last week that the home care workforce had grown by 15,000 in the past five months, which would constitute an almost 15% surge in the workforce. The figures – drawn from data only available to the minister, according to his office – are at odds with the experience of industry. Sean Rooney, chief executive of Leading Age Services Australia, an aged care sector peak group, said he had seen no figures reflecting such a significant boost to the home care workforce. “Providers report to LASA that they continue to face severe staffing challenges due to the pandemic, so it is difficult to see where these workers are coming from,” Rooney told the Guardian. Ahead of the this year’s budget, National Seniors Australia warned the government about precisely this point. The home care packages were welcome, the group said in its budget submission. But they were not enough without an adequate workforce to deliver them. It also provided several practical steps the government could take to unlock a new home care workforce, easily mobilised and often ready to work. Home care is typically provided through a combination of informal support, provided by family, and paid care workers. Yet the current pension arrangements effectively punish pensioners who want to take up caring work for family or loved ones. National Seniors said the “punitive, penny pinching pension system” punished people for working additional hours. It is advocating for exempting employment income from the age pension income test for low-wealth pensioners working in aged and health care. The group’s chief advocate, Ian Henschke, said the system was denying the sector a significant pool of workers for no good reason. “You’ve got people who work in aged care and home care who want to work more, who won’t work more because they get penalised 50 cents in the dollar,” Henschke said. “Why would anyone who is over 66.5 on a pension continue to work in aged care or home care? Yet they’re the very people who are often the most sympathetic to the older person, because they are about the age of the person’s daughter or son.” The government has provided $338.5m to expand, train and upskill the aged care workforce. The issue is personal for Henschke. Philip Henscke is his brother and Laurena was his sister-in-law. The number of people dying while waiting for their approved home care package has reduced in recent years. More than 50,000 older Australians have died since 2017-18. In the last six months of 2021, 3,802 people on the NPS died before receiving the home care package they had been approved for. More than 8,000 died in the 2020-21 financial year, and 10,563 died in 2019-20. Labor’s Mark Butler described the figures as a “national disgrace” and a sign the system was still in crisis, despite the reduction. “Most Australians want to age in their own home but the system that’s supposed to help them do that is in crisis,” he said. “There are still tens of thousands of older Australians waiting for Home Care Packages.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app The opposition has sought to make aged care a central plank of its re-election pitch. But the policies it has announced so far largely focus on residential care. Colbeck says the opposition has “offered nothing on home care”. “While Labor has offered nothing on home care – the Morrison Government is investing in aged care workforce initiatives that attract and retain a diverse range of workers with the right skills, knowledge and attributes to work and pursue a career in aged care,” a spokesperson said. “Initiatives include place-based approaches targeting local workers and national projects.” For Philip Henschke, the idea of encouraging pensioners into home care work is a good one. He had a “fantastic” care worker who was a pensioner, but told him he would be unable to work more than one day a week. “[Fixing that] would be a great help to fill the gap because we’re not going to get there,” he said. “We haven’t got the nurses, and what we really do need are these home care attendants.”",News/Australia news,"Too little, too late: who will fix the home care crisis for Australia’s ageing population?

4/26/2022,"Labor will vow to increase foreign aid to Pacific island countries and ramp up patrols to fight illegal fishing, as it makes an election pledge to “restore Australia’s place as first partner of choice for our Pacific family”. A boost to regional broadcasting is also part of the package, with Labor seeking to intensify political pressure on the prime minister, Scott Morrison, in the wake of China signing a security agreement with Solomon Islands. The shadow minister for foreign affairs, Penny Wong, who will outline the Labor plan alongside senior frontbench colleagues on Tuesday, accused Morrison of dropping the ball in the Pacific. “The vacuum Scott Morrison has created is being filled by others who do not share our interests and values,” Wong said in a clear reference to China. Morrison said on Sunday that Australia shared the same “red line” as the US and that a Chinese military base in the south Pacific would be unacceptable, but did not spell out what Australia would do if this occurred. Labor’s seven-part plan is understood to include a substantial increase to Australia’s Official Development Assistance, but the party has not revealed the exact amounts ahead of Tuesday’s announcement. Labor has released details of three other parts of the plan, including doubling Australia’s $12m in annual funding for aerial surveillance activities under the Pacific Maritime Security Program, which helps the region combat illegal fishing. An Albanese Labor government would consult Pacific countries about options for boosting aerial surveillance, such as increasing flying hours and the number of aircraft, improving sensors, and using drones. Surveillance could also be expanded to cover other security risks, including drug trafficking. Labor will also pledge to deepen existing links between the Australian defence force and its regional counterparts by setting up a new Australia-Pacific Defence School at a cost of $6.5m over four years. The school would train members of defence and security forces from Pacific island countries, with a focus on noncommissioned officer level uniformed personnel. Labor believes the new school will complement the existing Australia Pacific Security College, which is run by Australian National University and which targets senior officials and leaders with a focus on research and strategic issues. The shadow defence minister, Brendan O’Connor, said: “Rather than just talking tough, we will provide practical support for our neighbours to improve their security and protect their economies.” Another plank of the plan was focused on regional broadcasting, which was seen as a key lever of “soft power”. Labor would draw up an Indo-Pacific Broadcasting Strategy to “boost Australian content and to project Australian identity, values, and interests to the Indo-Pacific region”. This would include an $8m a year increase in funding to the ABC’s international program aimed at expanding ABC regional transmission and content production. Labor would use the strategy to review the potential restoration of Australian shortwave radio broadcasting capacity in the Pacific. The shadow minister for communications, Michelle Rowland, accused the government of complacency. “It costs us very little to tell a positive story about Australia in the region, but Scott Morrison has squandered Australia’s natural advantage of shared values with Pacific neighbours,” she said. The plan is also expected to include more support for climate infrastructure in the region and a resumption of bipartisan parliamentary trips to Pacific countries. Labor is also set to promise to improve Pacific labour arrangements to address economic challenges in the Pacific and ease Australia’s agricultural worker shortages. The opposition is mindful of the need to include safeguards to prevent worker exploitation. Morrison has been seeking to project strength on national security ahead of the 21 May election, but that message has been complicated by the finalisation of Beijing’s security agreement with Solomon Islands. The draft security agreement raised the possibility China could “make ship visits to, carry out logistical replenishment in, and have stopover and transition in Solomon Islands”, while Chinese forces could be used “to protect the safety of Chinese personnel and major projects in Solomon Islands”. Labor characterised the deal as the biggest Australian foreign policy failure in the Pacific since the second world war, but Morrison said China was exerting “enormous pressure” on Pacific island countries and did not “play by the same rules as transparent liberal democracies”. Morrison has sought to rely on assurances from the prime minister, Manasseh Sogavare, that Solomon Islands will not allow a military base. On Sunday, Morrison was asked to clarify what he meant by his statement that Australia shared “the same red line that the United States has when it comes to these issues”. “We won’t be having Chinese military naval bases in our region on our doorstep,” Morrison told reporters. Pressed on what Australia would actually do to stop such a prospect, Morrison said Sogavare had been clear that there would be no bases “and so he clearly shares our red line”. The Coalition has previously bristled at suggestions it had dropped the ball in the Pacific, insisting Solomon Islands is Australia’s third largest aid recipient overall, and the second largest in the Pacific region after Papua New Guinea. Labor has cited figures showing Australia’s bilateral official development assistance to Solomon Islands averaged $167.5m a year under the Coalition government, or about 28% lower than the $231.6m average under the former government. But the Australian government said it had offered additional assistance to the Pacific in separate programs, including Covid-related help.",News/Australia news,Labor pledges more foreign aid to Pacific with plan ‘to restore Australia’s place as first partner of choice’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/26/labor-pledges-more-foreign-aid-to-pacific-with-plan-to-restore-australias-place-as-first-partner-of-choice
4/26/2022,"Western screenwriting tradition says that conflict is the heart of all storytelling, but after a hard day you may not want to watch something stressful. Some people turn to “slow TV” – meditative footage of scenic train rides or people knitting that can go for 10-plus hours – but my preference is for what I’ll call “slow anime”, known in Japan as iyashikei or “healing-type” anime: stories that are designed to be as comfy and mellow as can be. Perhaps the best-known iyashikei anime outside Japan is Studio Ghibli’s 1988 film My Neighbour Totoro, a story in which nothing much happens until the last 20 minutes – despite the presence of soot spirits, a set of tanuki raccoons and a flying cat that is also a bus. Totoro contains many elements common to slow anime: an optimistic sense of wonder at the natural world, often explored through the prism of youth; some lush background art; and wonderfully tranquil music. Unlike other Ghibli films like Spirited Away or even the similarly chill (though more narratively focused) Kiki’s Delivery Service, Totoro revels in small joys: sharing time with family, cleaning a dusty old house together, or enjoying the fresh air while rambling through forests and fields. It all adds up to evoke the sort of feeling you might experience while doing those things yourself. It’s not that these slow anime shows and films don’t have plots, but the stories they tell tend to be simple and grounded, even if they contain fantastical elements. Episodes might be about picking apples, or going to the beach, or getting a (usually chill) part-time job, even visiting a cafe for (extremely chill) ghosts. If there’s any drama in them, it is equally mundane: someone forgot something, someone got a bit lost, it’s raining and you didn’t bring an umbrella. Despite such unexciting fare, these shows don’t feel boring so much as they do soothing. You might nod off to sleep, but it’s the sleep of someone who has had a hot chocolate under a warm weighted blanket. It’s simply nice. The genre does have its criticisms. The academic Paul Roquet traced the genre’s rise in Japan to the after-effects of the 1995 Kobe earthquake and sarin gas attacks on the Japanese underground , in an essay on the literary equivalent of iyashikei, which he calls “ambient literature”. Roquet argued that Japanese authors like Haruki Murukami and Banana Yoshimoto had created a genre that amounted to the avoidance of real problems, constituting “the ideological manipulation of those needs [healing and soothing] for commercial and political ends”. Soothing as they may be, iyashikei anime have launched merchandising empires selling anything from branded trinkets to straight-up camping gear, just like regular anime. But as Roquet also says, these criticisms apply more when the practice “slips from a form of temporary escape to a habit of perpetual withdrawal”. To my mind, iyashikei anime is like most other forms of media – if you don’t overindulge, you’ll be fine. Maybe you’ll even feel better for watching it. On that, here’s some of my best picks: Most Ghibli movies contain elements of iyashikei, but they’re often intermingled with a coming-of-age story, a romance or an adventure. Totoro is probably the purest in terms of just letting the wonders of the world wash over you. A group of high schoolers go camping in the mountains. That’s it. There’s two seasons so far and an upcoming movie I am absolutely dying to see later this year even though, inevitably, nothing much will happen. A witch moves in with her cousins in the Japanese countryside. Similar to Totoro, despite the presence of magic, most episodes are about pleasantly mundane tasks like following a cat around town or harvesting crops (screaming mandrakes, in this case). The first season of this comedy about a high school band was more traditionally structured, only in the second season does the show slow down and stop to smell the roses. The result is a joyful, somewhat nostalgic look at the everyday life of a handful of students as graduation approaches.",Arts/Culture,In praise of iyashikei: why we love soothing anime where nothing happens,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/26/in-praise-of-iyashikei-why-we-love-soothing-anime-where-nothing-happens
4/26/2022,"An inquest into the death in custody of an Aboriginal woman held in remand over theft-related offences will probe the state’s bail laws and healthcare in prisons when it begins on Tuesday. Veronica Nelson, a Gunditjmara, Dja Dja Wurrung, Wiradjuri and Yorta Yorta woman, was on remand when she was found dead in her cell at the maximum security Dame Phyllis Frost Centre in Melbourne’s west on 2 January 2020. She was 37. Nerita Waight, chief executive of the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service, said Nelson’s death was a tragedy for her family and friends. Waight said the state’s Indigenous communities have “seen far too much senseless loss of life in the Victorian justice system”. “Veronica should still be alive today and we hope to get some answers that help us understand why she is not and ensure it never happens again,” she said. An autopsy found Nelson suffered complications from Wilkie’s syndrome, a rare condition that is characterised by abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. She had been arrested three days earlier in the Melbourne CBD and denied bail after police discovered she was wanted for questioning over shoplifting. At a 2020 directions hearing, the Victorian coroner’s court heard Nelson had cried for help multiple times in the three hours before her death. During that time, prison and nursing staff did not check on Nelson physically, but communicated with her through an intercom system and a door flap, the court was told. A prison nurse gave Nelson Panadol after she reported leg camps and the anti-nausea drug Maxolon. The court also heard Nelson had been experiencing heroin withdrawals. The Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service will represent Nelson’s partner of 22 years, Percy Lovett, at the inquest. Lovett has previously described Nelson as a “strong woman” and someone who would always help others on the street, and said he wanted the inquest to ensure it was “easier for the next woman who get locked up”. Nelson’s mother, Donna Nelson, has remembered her daughter as a “warrior” with a “fighting spirit” who was deeply connected to her Aboriginal culture, and was like a “second mother” to her two brothers, Duane and Russell. Nelson had been arrested on Spencer Street in Melbourne on 30 December 2019, on theft charges and an outstanding warrant. She appeared in court later that day without legal representation and was refused bail, with a court hearing scheduled to take place two weeks later. She spent a night at the Dame Phyllis Frost Centre’s medical unit before being moved to a transition area for new arrivals. After the Bourke Street killings in 2017, the Andrews government tightened Victoria’s bail laws. Under the reform – which has resulted in a significant increase in the state’s remand population and delays for court hearings – the person charged with an offence must prove they meet “exceptional circumstances” or have “compelling reasons” to be released on bail. Thalia Anthony, a senior law lecturer at the University of Technology Sydney, said the legislative changes had shifted the focus towards “an assumption against bail”. “Systemically, the bail legislation and decision making has always worked against Aboriginal people. But when you tighten those laws and make it harder to get bail, then it’s going to impact on Aboriginal people and Aboriginal women more harshly and that bears out in the statistics,” Anthony told Guardian Australia. “The bail system, even at its best, is discriminatory because it doesn’t account for factors that would systemically discriminate against Aboriginal people. For example, there’s a higher chance of getting bail if you’re employed and have secure housing, and don’t move around.” Last month, a wide-ranging inquiry into Victoria’s criminal justice system recommended the state review its bail laws, with the changes leading to a rise in the number of people on remand. Women are disproportionately affected. It found almost half of all women in prison were on remand – an increase from 22% in 2010. A larger proportion of women had been held on remand in recent years than men, with this figure even higher for Aboriginal women. The Sentencing Advisory Council found the imprisonment rate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people almost doubled between 2010 and 2020, from 971.8 to 1,848 per 100,000 adults. The inquest will run until 27 May and will examine the circumstances and cause of Nelson’s death, including how she came to be in custody, the medical treatment she was provided and systemic issues in the state’s remand system.",News/Australia news,Inquest into Aboriginal woman’s death in custody to examine healthcare in Victoria’s prisons,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/26/inquest-into-aboriginal-womans-death-in-custody-to-examine-healthcare-in-victorias-prisons
4/26/2022,"A Coalition MP praised a now contentious trip to China featuring Labor’s deputy leader, Richard Marles, as “an invaluable opportunity to have open and candid dialogue”. The Morrison government has attempted to discredit the opposition’s claim that the major parties are united on China policy by highlighting Marles’ trip to China in 2019 and his speech to a Beijing university. Marles said at the time it would be a “profound mistake” to define China as an enemy. But it has emerged that the Liberal National party backbencher Ted O’Brien – who joined Marles and Labor’s Tanya Plibersek on the three-day study tour organised by the China Matters thinktank – praised the 2019 trip. Marles travelled to Beijing early to deliver the speech, before joining the study tour the next day. “China Matters provided an invaluable opportunity to have open and candid dialogue with thought-leaders, specialists and practitioners of the PRC [People’s Republic of China] government, business sector and civil society,” O’Brien said in a testimonial. “For Australia to continue navigating its future amidst an uncertain global political economy, it’s vitally important that we deepen our understanding of China and they deepen their understanding of us,” he said. O’Brien’s praise of China Matters appears to contradict Liberal senator James Paterson, who told the Australian newspaper on Monday that the thinktank was “a controversial organisation which is sympathetic to the Chinese Communist party”. The thinktank strongly disputes the claim. The members of the study tour also included the president of the National Farmers’ Federation, Fiona Simson, and Rio Tinto government relations adviser Brian Pontifex. When asked on Monday night whether he retained the same view about the September 2019 study tour and China Matters, O’Brien told Guardian Australia: “My testimonial stands.” But O’Brien said navigating how best to deal with China was “the biggest challenge facing our nation” and he worried the Labor party “seems so clueless”. “You need look no further than the dangerous and ill-conceived views of Richard Marles to realise the need for a far deeper understanding of China, its underlying motivations and intentions,” O’Brien said. “The same goes for China’s need to better understand Australia, as the communist regime’s current strategy of bullying and coercion and refusing dialogue has failed because our positions are based on a set of principles and values that we’re prepared to strongly defend. “While there’s a place for parliamentary delegations, they’re not enough to develop a sophisticated understanding of the various complexities of a country like China, and Richard’s views on the regime make this apparent.” The day before the study tour began, Marles delivered a speech to the Beijing Foreign Studies University in which he said Australia must seek to build the relationship with China “not just in economic terms, but also through exploring political cooperation and even defence cooperation”. Marles, who was then Labor’s defence spokesperson, said talk of a new cold war was “silly and ignorant” and Australia did not have “an exclusive right to engage with the Pacific”. The basis of Australia’s interest in the Pacific “cannot be about attempting to engage in the strategic denial of others”. After a renewed focus on the September 2019 trip in recent days, Marles noted that he had also raised human rights concerns. Labor argues the government is seeking to distract from the signing of a security agreement between China and Solomon Islands on the Coalition’s watch. Marles admitted on Monday to an “administrative mistake” in failing to disclose the China Matters-funded portion of his trip to China on the register of members’ interests. Both O’Brien and Plibersek had already done so. The Australian reported on Monday that Marles had claimed $6,191 in taxpayer funds for the initial portion of the visit to China, prior to joining the China Matters-funded study tour. Marles said the travel was “in an official capacity in accordance with the parliamentary business resources framework”. “All travel for parliamentary business is reported quarterly by the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority,” Marles said in a statement. “On this occasion, an administrative error was made and part of my trip – paid for by China Matters – was not on my register of members’ interests as it should have been. I have sought to rectify this. “My trip to Beijing has not been a secret, and has been well covered in multiple newspapers, online coverage and several interviews.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Marles has confirmed an earlier report in the Australian that he had given a copy of the speech to the Chinese embassy in Canberra in advance – but said he had not made any changes after doing so. He said on Saturday he shared the speech because he had “criticised China” and “wanted to make sure that the Chinese government were not at all surprised”. In the 2019 speech, Marles said Australia would continue to “raise our concerns, as we have about the minority Uyghur population in Xinjiang, or the situation in Hong Kong”. “We do this on behalf of all Australians who believe people have a right to express their views through peaceful and lawful assembly,” Marles said on 23 September 2019. Marles told reporters on Saturday: “How many government ministers have gone to China, and in China publicly criticised the Chinese government?” The Coalition has been seeking to shine attention on Marles’ speech since February when Paterson uploaded it to his website and questioned why it was not on the Labor MP’s own site. Paterson told Sky News: “I would never, ever share a speech in advance of giving it with a foreign authoritarian government.” In parliament, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, labelled Marles a “Manchurian candidate” before withdrawing the claim amid pushback from current and former security officials. Last week the defence minister, Peter Dutton, said: “Richard Marles, of course, went to Beijing. I don’t know who paid for his trip. I don’t know who he visited there. I don’t know who he spoke to. I don’t know the relationships that he formed. I don’t know who he’s kept in contact with since that time. But he came back with some certain views and he’s expressed those.”",News/Australia news,Richard Marles’ contentious China trip was praised by Coalition MP,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/26/richard-marles-contentious-china-trip-was-praised-by-coalition-mp
4/26/2022,"When Scott Morrison visited Western Australia in March, he briefly fumbled a question from a reporter by saying he had met the state’s opposition leader, the Liberal David Honey. Morrison had to be reminded that the opposition leader is Mia Davies, a National, after the landslide 2021 election returned just two Liberals to the WA lower house. That result sent shockwaves through the Liberal party, and suggested WA could deliver a rich return for federal Labor: Swan (on a 3.2% margin), Pearce (5.2%) and Hasluck (5.9%) could fall with a swing just one-third as big as Mark McGowan’s. Since the Labor premier’s emphatic re-election, Morrison has told Western Australians they could have both McGowan and Morrison – refining the pitch to acknowledge that although he may not be universally popular, he is at least a known quantity. But many voters in Swan and Hasluck say Morrison lacks the consistency to make the case for “better the devil you know” over Anthony Albanese’s small-target approach. Andrew, an undecided voter in Swan who Guardian Australia meets on the South Perth foreshore, complains all parties have the “same agenda”. But he has “no confidence” in the prime minister, he says, and “Morrison and his personality” may be the best thing Labor has going for it. “When he’s questioned, all his answers are deflected on to something else, there is no definite yes or no … I’d rather someone say the wrong thing and have a point of view than just change the subject.” Nigel Harrison, who votes for Labor or the Greens, says Morrison “flip-flops continuously”. He says Western Australians were frustrated by the PM’s approach to the pandemic. “He just drove us nuts,” Harrison says. “All the Liberal states were worried about businesses not the people.” WA remained blissfully Covid-free for much of the pandemic, closed to the rest of Australia despite the Morrison government’s attempts to help Clive Palmer force the state open through a high court case – which it pulled out of in the face of overwhelming unpopularity. Many undecided voters either say Morrison got in the way of McGowan’s pandemic response, or, at best, took credit for it. But Harrison worries that if people are voting on personality, Albanese “may cost us the election” – he sees the Labor leader as “a bit of a wet leaf sometimes”. Swan is a perennial must-win seat for Labor in a state where it has historically underperformed. The retiring Liberal MP Steve Irons has held it since 2007. Directly across from the Perth CBD, it takes in most of the area between the Swan River and Canning River, including the airport and Curtin University. Voters lean Liberal at its fringes along the Swan River in the west and Hasluck in the east. When we visited in March, awareness of the local candidates in Swan was low as war in Ukraine, floods on the east coast and the first community spread of Covid after the WA border reopened crowded the news cycle. Eventually, Don Stephens, a Swan voter we find out-of-electorate by Cottesloe beach, ventures that the Labor candidate “is a female engineer, which seems positive”. Labor’s Zaneta Mascarenhas tells Guardian Australia she is excited that Swan’s next member will be a woman, but emphasises the electorate has “two very different candidates” to choose from. She notes that her opponent, Liberal Kristy McSweeney, comes from a “political dynasty” and has worked for a federal MP and as a news commentator. Mascarenhas on the other hand was “born and bred in the goldfields” to a metalworker dad and a cleaner mum. Her career, she says, started “in steel-capped boots”. Asked about improving representation in politics, she replies that though some are interested in her candidacy because she is a woman of colour, she is “most excited” about the diversity of skills she will bring to parliament, as an engineer from a science background. The pitch: identity politics for blue-collar blokes. Mascarenhas plays it skilfully – and more authentically than “ScoMo”, the welding jack of all trades and master of none caricature constructed by the PM. Mascarenhas says Morrison is “not a leader” and suggests his attempts to recover the Coalition’s position through scares about national security or the economy are “desperate” and will fall flat. “Australians can spot a fake.” Out doorknocking, Mascarenhas shows her talent in the field. She calibrates her tone: respectful towards Irons when speaking to an older gent, more critical when addressing a young mother who feels left behind by the Coalition government. Federal parliament “needs more people with real skills”, she tells Bernie Lawrence, the Irons voter. “It’s not so much what you’ve done or what you’ve learned,” he replies. “It’s what you can do for the people in this area.” Delivery will be his focus when casting a vote. Despite stints as a staffer over 16 years, McSweeney, who worked for Tony Abbott and Michaelia Cash, rejects the image of her as an insider when we meet near her South Perth office. She appears on Sky News “at night time”, she says. During the day, she spent seven years building her own business, a PR consultancy – “from a laundromat,” she says, “because I couldn’t afford wifi in my apartment that I was renting”. McSweeney paints her political experience as a virtue, arguing she won’t be “bamboozled” if she makes it to Canberra. Her election would make for the “very first conservative mother-daughter team in Australian politics”. (Her mother, Robyn McSweeney, started as a social worker and ended up as child protection minister.) At Belmont Forum Shopping Centre, it’s the federal issues deciding people’s votes. Most want a change of government, perhaps because the electorate is Labor at its core. Beth Runciman, a first-time voter, “doesn’t really agree with the Liberal policies”, which she sees as “more high economic status-based”. She associates Labor with greater equality: “I’m more for helping people who need the help.” John Eaton, a teacher who votes Greens, says “the most important thing is we get rid of Morrison and his cronies”. He cites “the need for a federal Icac”, support for disadvantage in times of crisis, and Morrison’s “inability to respond to crises”. Milan Simic, a rusted-on Labor voter, criticises Morrison for “getting too much in the political side against China, which is our number one trader”. Michelle Parker says after a few terms of the Coalition, Australia “needs true leadership in our prime minister, something that’s really been lacking”. “I want to see a federal Icac, more than anything,” she says. “I think we need to look into the rorts and things that have been happening.” Party operatives say if Labor can win Swan and Pearce (vacated by the retiring Liberal MP Christian Porter) then WA will have done its share for Albanese. But Hasluck, a sprawling outer-urban electorate stretching over Perth’s north-east, is also a target – the sort of seat that could turn a nail-biting election night and hung parliament into a workable majority. At Guildford train station, Sue Millard, a nurse and Labor voter, says Morrison “hasn’t done a very good job” on the pandemic. “We’ve been very lucky in WA to have Mark McGowan and the stance he’s taken.” She cites other concerns, too – “sexism, lack of concern with the fire that happened and he was on holiday”. It’s not just progressive voters unhappy with the federal pandemic response. While that cohort wishes Morrison had left the job to McGowan, reactionary right voters criticise the PM for not stepping in enough over the state’s sweeping vaccine mandates, which cover 75% of the workforce. At Ellenbrook Central shopping centre we meet Ken Taylor and his wife, Yvonne. Ken, who lost his fly-in-fly-out construction job due to a mandate, says Covid “has been managed very poorly from the government … in the sense that it’s not a pandemic”. “I certainly won’t be voting for the major parties,” he says. “There’d be no way I’d vote for them after this.” Ken says he’ll vote independent or for minor parties, and scrutinise preferences to “make sure they’re not going to Labor or the other larger parties”. “Scott Morrison could stop this … He could turn around and say these mandates aren’t right. “I don’t think Morrison will [win] and I think it would be a disappointment if Albanese gets in the seat – he probably will.” But while Morrison is poorly rated, the Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, is a chance to hold Hasluck against a swing to Labor. Wyatt, the member since 2010, is well known in all parts of the electorate except Ellenbrook, an expanding outer-urban project home suburb redistributed into Hasluck from Pearce. Greg Waller, a former Labor voter in Midland, says he votes for Wyatt because he “does a good job”. “Really, it’s the local MP you can interact with and get issues corrected [by] that you’re worried about,” Waller says. “Scott Morrison’s not going to answer my phone call, but Ken will.” Waller is less impressed with Morrison, whose performance he says is “not real good”. “He puts his foot in his mouth sometimes,” he says, citing trade disputes that “wouldn’t have happened if he kept his cool”. Gretchen Walsh, a Liberal voter, says she is “quite happy” with Wyatt. She has “no confidence whatsoever” in Albanese however. “He only criticises everything, he doesn’t suggest, ‘we could do this or do that’,” she says. Walsh credits both Morrison and McGowan for their handling of the pandemic. “Because of these times and this Covid-19, anybody with any power has been doing the best they can.” It’s a common refrain from Liberal voters – who feel sorry for Morrison and say he has done well in the circumstances – but it’s often tinged with surprise that others have turned against the Coalition in what is usually a stronghold. We meet Wyatt outside the Ray Owens Sports Centre in Lesmurdie. It’s where the West Rise special needs basketball competition runs, of which Wyatt has been a patron since 2011. He argues the Coalition is better on both local and national levels, citing the economy and national security, including higher defence spending than under Labor and “deporting people who are significant offenders and dangerous to the community”. Asked about the PM’s line that Western Australians can have both McGowan and Morrison, Wyatt’s face falls before he makes the case the two have similarities. “The premier is popular because of the border closure and people have looked at that as a strength,” Wyatt says. “The prime minister is very pragmatic … We closed our international borders to travellers from the beginning. So we did have a border closure to protect us.” Labor’s Hasluck candidate, Tania Lawrence, says the election result will reflect that Western Australians hold Morrison “responsible for his failure to act on vaccines and on quarantine”. Lawrence says the electorate’s big issues are aged care, climate change – “given we live and breathe the risk of climate change with bushfires” – and mobile phone coverage, which is “patchy across the entire electorate”. Lawrence doesn’t have “any beef” with Wyatt, who she describes as “personable”. But she says the electorate has “expectations that the Liberal government should have delivered by now, and have failed to do so”. “Is that a reflection on Ken? That’s ultimately for the voters to decide.”",News/Australia news,Why not both?

4/26/2022,"It must be difficult to cast Funny Girl. Whoever anchors the musical stands in the shadow of two stage titans: Fanny Brice, the vaudeville star whose life provides the (loose) basis for a show that’s basically the early 20th century version of A Star is Born, and Barbra Streisand, who originated the role as a relatively unknown 21-year-old in 1964 and blended a story of singular talent and inevitable fame seamlessly with her own. (Streisand also won the best actress Oscar for the 1968 film adaptation.) For the show’s first Broadway revival, producers have handed the reins to Beanie Feldstein, a Broadway sophomore (she made her debut in 2017 as Minnie Fay in Hello, Dolly!) primarily known for her sharp screen work in Booksmart, Lady Bird and as Monica Lewinsky in Impeachment: American Crime Story. The casting makes sense on paper; Feldstein brings an endearing everygirl to Fanny. Her crisp comedic timing adapts well to the show’s slapstick gags and Fanny’s avant-klutz schtick; her deep brown eyes, wide as saucers, effectively project a real human on and off the meta-stage. Whether in diva mode or an anxious, awkward frenzy, Feldstein mostly hangs on to a torpedo of a character. But this is a musical, one with some full-tilt belting, and her singing just isn’t up to par. Paper-thin, reedy in the higher registers and overly nasal throughout, Feldstein’s voice is noticeably untextured compared to the rest of the cast. The role that gave Streisand some of her staples – People and Don’t Rain on My Parade, Funny Girl’s showstopper that Feldstein visibly musters every ounce of strength to blare – requires a power singer. Feldstein simply isn’t one. Which is a serious problem when a show hinges on the story of one woman’s undeniable talent for the stage, let alone in a role pioneered by one of the most renowned singers of the last half century; the rest of the production, directed by Michael Mayer and choreographed by Ellenore Scott, seems to be hustling to compensate for this lack. That’s accomplished mostly by tap virtuoso Jared Grimes as Fanny’s dance director Eddie Ryan, a superb Ramin Karimloo as Fanny’s suave yet feeble-minded husband Nick Arnstein, and an always entertaining Jane Lynch as her straight-shooting, salon-owning mother. (Unfortunately for Feldstein, the Glee star’s casting serves as a reminder that Lea Michele, who publicly semi-gunned for the role for over a decade, can nail Don’t Rain on My Parade.) The show, with original music by Jule Styne and lyrics by Bob Merrill from the book by Isobel Lennart, opens at Manhattan’s New Amsterdam Theater in the early 20s; Brooklyn-bred Fanny, now years into vaudeville stardom with a company called the Ziegfield Follies, has returned to the theater on the night of her husband’s release from prison for embezzlement. The anticipation triggers a flood of memories, which play as an extended flashback until late in the second act: Fanny’s start as a clumsy chorus girl desperate for stardom, honing her persona as a self-consciously unpretty comedienne, meeting the debonair gambler Nick Arnstein, supporting his dubious endeavors with her own money. Harvey Fierstein’s revised book switches some numbers around – Mrs Brice and Eddie’s Who Taught Her Everything She Knows?, a highlight of the evening, is effectively moved to the second act – and cuts down on the second half to primarily focus on Nick’s feckless swanning and swirling of the drain. (The show runs nearly three hours, including a 15-minute intermission.) The arrangement works, especially as it provides a showcase for Karimloo’s Nick, at once a lout, a charmer, a sympathetic poker player down on his luck, a devoted husband, and a pitiable figure. Feldstein, generally good as a precocious young woman, seems befuddled by the evolution into romance and marriage, leaving Karimloo to carry later scenes near single-handedly. In the slapstick dining room seduction number You Are Woman, I Am Man, for instance, Karimloo jumps from the floor to the chaise while keeping his body horizontal, as if snapped by a rubber band; Feldstein, meanwhile, keeps up the game with a too-piercing cackle. Ironically, a show about one woman’s spectacle, fame, and ineffable charm was strongest in its most populous moments – the Follies chorus, with elaborate, stunning costumes by Susan Hilferty (from diaphanous butterflies to gold-flecked soldiers). The rowdy tavern number Henry Street, featuring an excellent Toni DiBuono as nosy neighbor Mrs Strakosh. The spin of the set by David Zinn, which manages to convey action from Brooklyn to Manhattan stages to a Cleveland train station in a rotating, center stage that occasionally resembled a brick turret. Grimes deserves another mention for his tap dancing, choreographed by Ayodele Casel, which was simply mesmerizing. The full glitz provided to His Love Makes Me Beautiful, in which Fanny improvises her debut for the Follies, was a highlight both for the production and for Feldstein’s finesse of full-body physical comedy on stage. I felt for Feldstein, at times alone on stage singing numbers she just can’t fully carry. There are high points to this new Funny Girl – moments of comedy and genuine laughs. But this is Broadway; the bar is higher than that. Funniness alone didn’t make Fanny Brice, the musical character, a star.",Arts/Stage,Funny Girl review – Beanie Feldstein struggles in Broadway revival,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/25/funny-girl-review-beanie-feldstein-struggles-broadway-revival
4/26/2022,"That first training session. Has ever a training session been so romanticised and mythologised as Paul Pogba’s first for Juventus in 2012? Is there a training session you would rather have been there to see in the flesh? “He is not real,” Giorgio Chiellini remembers thinking as they watched their new teenage magician at work. “Are they blind in Manchester?” Gigi Buffon exclaimed. “We were just laughing in total disbelief,” Andrea Pirlo later wrote. “That a player with so much obvious quality was able to leave a club the size of Manchester United for free.” Well, you can write your own joke there. And yet as United prepare to part ways with Pogba for a second time, having spent almost £90m to buy him back, you will find very few at the club who feel even the slightest twinge of regret. “Fuck off,” the United fans roared at him as he was substituted against Norwich last week, six years of bottled frustration finally finding its voice. This will, in all likelihood, be Pogba’s epitaph at United: a profligate indulgence, an expensive failure, a player who can be safely jettisoned with the minimum of fuss. At which point it is probably necessary to urge a pause for reflection. Yes, this is probably for the best. No, an increasingly injury-prone 29-year-old on £200,000 a week is probably not the best man to have hanging around the place as you begin a cultural reset under a new manager. But the predominant emotion should be not relief or vindictiveness but sadness: that English football never really saw the best of a player who really could do it all. It feels like hyperbole now but it wasn’t. When Pirlo warned that “football should get ready for a new king” or Patrick Vieira described him as “the next great French midfielder” or Zinedine Zidane claimed he could be “one of the best players ever”, they were simply expressing what the educated eye was already telling them. Even now there remains enormous respect for Pogba beyond these shores, particularly in Turin where he won four scudetti with Juventus who, for all their Aaron Ramsey- and Weston McKennie‑flavoured experiments, have never really managed to replace him. This is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. On the contrary: if United are serious about examining where things have gone wrong for them, it is probably worth analysing how and why they managed to squander this generational talent. Because if the answer is simply “it was his own fault” or “he wasn’t good enough”, then they are in grave danger of making exactly the same mistakes. Even now there remains a basic misunderstanding of what Pogba was supposed to be doing at United. Even now fans and pundits complain that he did not “dominate” enough, did not take games “by the scruff of the neck”, whatever that means. Evidently that world-record fee created its own choking expectations of a midfielder who would win games on his own; Roy Keane and Paul Scholes and Michael Carrick all in one. Hey, star footballer. We buy you. Win us things. Make us big again. Whose fault was that, really? Shortly after joining United Ed Woodward – then a vice-chairman – gave an interview in which he complained that the club had only two names on the 25-man Ballon d’Or shortlist. “I don’t like that,” he said. “We should be aspiring to have the best players playing for us.” And so like Ángel di María before him, like Alexis Sánchez and Cristiano Ronaldo after him, Pogba was the right player signed for the wrong reasons: the product of a grotesque star fetish that has set United back a decade. Future historians of United will gape at the delusions that gripped them during that era, a kind of madness, a narcissism bordering on megalomania. “The level of engagement and fervour we get is on par with the world’s major religions,” Richard Arnold, then managing director, said and instead of being thrown out of the club for crimes against sanity he was promoted to chief executive: the sort of decision that can really be taken only by people who don’t know football, who don’t even really like it very much, except as an accessory to their own personal enrichment. Into this void stepped Pogba, all dabs and hashtags, all cute passing triangles but nobody to triangulate them with, a plethora of mixed messages and fluctuating emotions. Commercially he was indispensable. Fans would change their opinion of him by the week. Pundits would get weirdly enraged by him for reasons they could not really place: just this sense of different worlds, different energies, a force they could not quite understand and so ended up criticising with statements like: “His hair looks ridiculous.” There were strong rumours that he played computer games and owned a car. It is a fair criticism to point out that Pogba has not really improved in six years at United. But then who has? United is where talent goes to wither, a team with billions in the bank that is heading for the Uefa Conference League, and to place the blame squarely at Pogba’s feet is a bit like turning up at the scene of an arson and arresting the lighter fluid. Pogba rejoined United at 23 and now looks set to leave at 29. These were his best years, his footballing prime, and he gave them to a club that now actively despises him. For all this there remains a sense of promise unfulfilled, of dreams unrealised: a departure that should be mourned, not scorned.",Sport/Football,"Paul Pogba’s wasted prime should be a cause for sadness, not scorn | Jonathan Liew",https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/25/paul-pogbas-wasted-prime-should-be-a-cause-for-sadness-not-sneering
4/26/2022,"A man arrested by police investigating the disappearance of a 33-year-old woman in Burnley is said to be known to her. Detectives have been given 36 more hours to question a 50-year-old man, from Burnley, on suspicion of kidnap. In a statement on Monday, Lancashire constabulary said the man was known to Katie Kenyon, who has not been seen since Friday morning. Kenyon was seen leaving an address in Todmorden Road, Burnley. At about 9.30am, a woman matching her description was witnessed leaving with a man and travelling in a silver Ford Transit to the Bolton-by-Bowland area of north Lancashire. Kenyon, from Padiham, near Burnley, has not been seen since. Family members said her disappearance was out of character. Police have brought in mountain rescue teams and firefighters to help search the rural area. She is described as white, 5ft 9in, with shoulder-length blond hair. She was last seen wearing a blue cardigan, a light blue and white top, and black leggings.

4/26/2022,"Five railway stations in central and western Ukraine were hit by Russian airstrikes in the space of an hour on Monday, as the war ground on relentlessly in the south and east of the country. Oleksander Kamyshin, the head of Ukrainian Railways, said five train stations came under fire, causing an unspecified number of casualties, as most of Ukraine was placed under an unusually long air raid warning for two hours on Monday morning. Kamyshin said one of the attacks took place at about 8.30am in Krasne, near Lviv in western Ukraine, at what the governor of the region described as a “traction substation” that handled power supply to other lines. He said emergency workers were at the scene. Maksym Kozytskyi, the head of the regional government in Lviv, said that during the attack Ukrainian anti-aircraft systems destroyed another missile fired at the region. Ukraine’s military command said Russia was trying to bomb rail infrastructure to disrupt arms supplies from foreign countries. “They are trying to destroy the supply routes of military-technical assistance from partner states. To do this, they focus strikes on railway junctions,” it wrote in a Facebook post. Russia’s defence ministry said it had destroyed six railway facilities used to supply Ukrainian forces with foreign weapons. Meanwhile, a government building in Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria was shelled from a hand grenade launcher on Monday, the press service of the Russian-backed unrecognised state said on its Telegram channel. According to Transnistrian officials, a building belonging to the ministry of state security was hit in the region’s capital, Tiraspol, on Monday evening. There were no immediate reports of injuries. A number of images circulating on social media appeared to show smoke coming out of broken windows of the government building. It was not immediately clear who was behind the apparent attack. Last week a senior Russian commander said the goal of Russia’s new offensive was to seize control of southern Ukraine and to gain access to Transnistria, which lies on the southern Ukrainian border. While military experts have said it was unlikely that Russian forces would be able to stage an offensive towards the border with Moldova at this moment, the statements nevertheless raised fears in Moldova over Russia’s intentions. With Moscow’s support, Transnistria fought a war against Moldova in the 1990s that left the territory with de facto independence and a garrison of about 1,500 Russian troops. If confirmed to be linked to the war, it would be the first spillover of the conflict into another European country. The train station attacks in Ukraine were not the first of the war. On 8 April in Kramatorsk, in eastern Ukraine, two ballistic missiles exploded over the railway station building, dropping deadly cluster munitions that killed 59 people and injured hundreds more. On Sunday Russian missile strikes on an oil refinery and power plant in Kremenchuk killed one person and wounded seven, according to officials. Moscow said it had destroyed oil production facilities there. Serhiy Borzov, the governor of the Vinnytsia region in central Ukraine, said Moscow fired rockets at two towns, causing an unspecified number of deaths and injuries. Russian shelling and assaults continued on Monday along most of the front in the east, including missile and bomb attacks on a huge steelworks in Mariupol where 1,000 civilians are holed up along with about 2,000 Ukrainian fighters. Serhiy Volyna, the commander of Ukraine’s 36th marine brigade forces in Mariupol, said in an interview with an opposition lawmaker posted on YouTube on Sunday that Russia was targeting the complex with air and artillery bombardments. “We are taking casualties, the situation is critical … we have very many wounded men, [some] are dying, it’s a difficult [situation] with guns, ammunition, food, medicines … the situation is rapidly worsening,” Volyna said, speaking from the plant. The Russian defence ministry said it was opening a humanitarian corridor at 2pm (11am GMT) on Monday for all civilians to leave the besieged plant. “The armed forces of the Russian Federation and the formations of the Donetsk people’s republic from 2pm Moscow time on 25 April 2022 unilaterally cease any hostilities, units are withdrawn to a safe distance and ensure the withdrawal of the specified category of citizens in any directions they choose,” the defence ministry said in a statement posted on its Facebook page. Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of not holding fire during previous attempts to establish humanitarian routes out of the city. The Russian defence ministry on Monday repeated its claims that “nationalists” were holding civilians hostages as “human shields” at the Azovstal plant. It said: “If civilians are still at the metallurgical plant, then we demand that the Kyiv authorities immediately give the appropriate order to the commanders of nationalist formations for their release.” The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, have returned to Poland after a visit to Kyiv, the highest-level US visit to the capital since Russia invaded in February. During talks, Blinken and Austin told Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that the US would provide more than $300m (£235m) in military financing and had approved a $165m sale of ammunition, bringing total US security assistance since the invasion to about $3.7bn. More than $400m will also be split among 15 other nations in central and eastern Europe and the Balkans. Russia told the US to stop sending arms to Ukraine, with Moscow’s ambassador to Washington warning that large western deliveries of weapons were inflaming the conflict and would lead to more losses. Anatoly Antonov, Russia’s ambassador to the US, said such arms deliveries were aimed at weakening Russia but that they were escalating the conflict in Ukraine while undermining efforts to reach some sort of peace agreement. “What the Americans are doing is pouring oil on the flames,” Antonov told the Rossiya 24 TV channel. “I see only an attempt to raise the stakes, to aggravate the situation, to see more losses.” Antonov, who has served as ambassador to Washington since 2017, said an official diplomatic note had been sent to Washington expressing Russia’s concerns. No reply had been given, he said. “We stressed the unacceptability of this situation when the United States of America pours weapons into Ukraine, and we demanded an end to this practice,” Antonov said. The interview was replayed on Russian state television throughout Monday.

4/26/2022,"What’s gone wrong at the Home Office (‘Inhumane’ Homes for Ukraine scheme requests security scans for baby girl, 24 April)? On 22 February, we submitted an application for a visa for my wife’s 15-year-old daughter, Lisa, to come to the UK from Ukraine as the child of a parent settled in the UK. Two days later, Russian forces invaded Ukraine. On 26 February, we arranged for Lisa to travel on her own to Warsaw, where my wife, Zoriana, flew out to meet her. They submitted her biometrics in Warsaw on 28 February, and later that week I managed to get her case escalated as urgent. Since then we’ve been advised that we should abandon our application and apply for a visa under the new Ukraine family scheme. However, the advice on the long-term implications differs depending on who you talk to. We did get an email four weeks ago asking us to pay the immigration health surcharge and to check our junk mailbox for a link to pay this. If we didn’t receive the link (we didn’t), we were to let them know by sending a message to the “document upload” email address and they would “urgently” resend it. We immediately did this, and have repeated this three times, each time receiving confirmation of receipt. Since then we have heard nothing, and we fear that our application has disappeared into a black hole. All the phone lines steer you through hundreds of options, all ending with a voice message. We cannot speak to anyone. I decided to send a complaint using the online form. This is where frustration turned into despair; after filling in all the relevant details including the applicant’s name, passport number and date of birth – a message came up: “Applicants must be over 18 to complain.”Lee KnellerLondon  We are hoping to sponsor a Ukrainian family, but we have become tied up in needless bureaucracy. The family – a mother and two boys aged three and 10 – are still in Ukraine. They had a sponsor and received their visas weeks ago, but unfortunately the original sponsor had to pull out. We stepped in as new sponsors. After many attempts, we managed to speak to the immigration helpline and were informed that the family would need to apply for new visas to reflect the new sponsor. We are doing everything we can to help this family. They are stuck in Ukraine, even though they have visas. Surely it should be simple to get our police and home checks done and simply update the visa data to reflect the change of sponsor? We have applied for new visas, but the system is not at all transparent and we are fully expecting something to go wrong, as they will be confused by this second visa application.

There are individual men and women and there are families”, Margaret Thatcher, 1987). Since this is demonstrably nonsense, for such players to compete would send a message to Russian viewers that their country has incurred only limited opprobrium for invading another sovereign state, killing tens of thousands of people and reducing cities such as Mariupol to uninhabitable ruins, and that those are less important than hitting a ball over a net.Christopher ClaytonChristleton, Cheshire  Opponents of the ban on Russian tennis players at Wimbledon make much of the rights of the players as private individuals.

4/26/2022,"Ten children in the UK have required a liver transplant following a recent surge in severe hepatitis cases among young children, with the current total standing at 114 cases across all four UK nations. A lack of exposure to common adenoviruses due to Covid restrictions during the past two years combined with a recent spike in adenovirus infection as society opens back up is the most likely explanation, experts say. Adenoviruses are common viruses that can cause a range of symptoms, from common cold-like symptoms, to fever, pneumonia, diarrhoea and conjunctivitis. They do not usually cause hepatitis, although this can be a very rare complication of some types of adenovirus infection. Speaking during an emergency session at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases in Lisbon on Monday, Dr Meera Chand, incident director for UKHSA’s investigation into the hepatitis surge, said that of 81 cases reported in England so far, 43 children had fully recovered, while 38 were still in hospital. Seven of the transplant cases were in England. “The cases in England are not known to be connected to each another and are dispersed all over the country,” she said. The vast majority of cases have involved children aged one to six (median age: three), and have occurred during the past three to five weeks. None of the affected children have died. A leading hypothesis is that surge in severe hepatitis is a knock-on effect of the pandemic, with lockdowns and other restrictions having meant that many children have had less exposure to common viruses than normal, resulting in an inadequate immune response when confronted with infection as society opens back up. Adenoviruses are a prime suspect: they are spread through close personal contact, coughing or sneezing, and touching contaminated surfaces. Of the 53 children with hepatitis in England who have been tested for adenovirus so far, 40 (75%) tested positive. Adenovirus infections among one- to four-year-olds in England are also currently at their highest level compared with any other time during the past five years, Chand said. “I think our leading hypothesis, given the data that we’ve seen, is that we probably have a normal adenovirus circulating, but we have a co-factor affecting a particular age group of young children which is either rendering that infection more severe, or causing it to trigger some kind of [inappropriate immune response],” said Chand. Prof Deirdre Kelly, a paediatric hepatologist at Birmingham Women’s and Children’s NHS trust and part of a group working with UKHSA to investigate the cases, said: “It may be due to the fact that children who have been largely isolated are responding to viruses that they would normally have built up an immunity to at an early age or it could be previous infection with Covid that has affected the body’s defence systems.” Between January and April 2018, the Birmingham centre, which is the largest of three specialist centres in the UK that treat severe liver disease in children, saw six severe unexplained hepatitis cases in children. “In the same time interval this year we saw about 40,” Kelly said. “We don’t have the answer why but it’s likely to be something to do with the pandemic because we never had this before.” Another possibility is that recent Covid infection could suppress the immune system, making children more vulnerable to serious side-effects from normally fairly innocuous viruses; or that a new, more virulent strain of adenovirus is in circulation, although initial genotyping has found no evidence for this, Kelly said. Most of the infections appear to involve adenovirus 41F, which usually causes diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain and fever. Cases of severe hepatitis among young children have also been detected in 12 other countries, with at least 169 cases reported to the World Health Organization so far. Most of the reported cases have been in the UK, followed by Spain (13 cases) and Israel (12 cases). Cases have also been reported in the US, Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, Italy, France, Norway, Romania and Belgium.",News/Society,Ten UK children require transplant amid surge in hepatitis cases,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/25/ten-uk-children-require-transplant-amid-surge-in-hepatitis-cases
4/26/2022,"That the NHS has diverted so much inpatient care into the private sector is a disgrace (NHS paying £2bn a year to private hospitals for mental health patients, 24 April). When I became an NHS consultant psychiatrist in 1992, I had 70 inpatients under my care; when I retired in 2017, I had seven. I took early retirement partly because a psychiatric crisis service without enough beds is dangerous: it is like a surgeon being asked to operate without instruments. Many clinicians working in mental health are wasting time looking for non-existent NHS beds instead of treating patients. Once in a private sector bed, patients with common treatable mental health problems stay there, as private hospitals lack the multidisciplinary skills that get people better. Also, private hospitals have the perverse incentive that they do not get paid if they discharge patients. Private sector “care” is a false economy – another example of failed Tory privatisation.Jeremy SeymourSheffield  I endorse the views of the NHS psychiatrist who said that private mental health hospitals have no incentive to discharge patients (‘Woeful scarcity’: NHS psychiatrist decries lack of mental health beds, 24 April). As a member of a health authority patient review team, I found that they often resisted appeals to discharge patients until Mental Health Act tribunals said that they were fit for “release”. The hospitals were often remote, which made it difficult for relatives to keep in touch, and were very expensive.

4/26/2022,"Global stock markets fell sharply on Monday as fears of new lockdowns in China added to concerns over the health of the world economy. China’s benchmark share index posted its biggest one-day tumble since February 2020, after Beijing’s biggest district began mass testing for Covid-19 because of a rise in infections in the capital. The CSI 300 index fell by 4.9% to hit its lowest level since late May 2020, as authorities ordered that residents in Chaoyang, home to 3.45 million people, should be tested three times this week. Raw materials producers, technology companies and industrial groups were among the major fallers. Fears that restrictions will be imposed in Beijing also prompted panic buying at supermarkets, as residents braced for curbs similar to those implemented in Shanghai, where a lockdown has entered its fourth week. On Sunday, a municipality official warned that Beijing’s outbreak was “spreading stealthily” from unknown sources, and “developing rapidly”. Concerns that China could impose further lockdowns, slowing its recovery, hit markets across the region, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng shedding 3.7% and Australia’s S&P/ASX index off 1.5%. In London, the FTSE 100 index dropped by 141 points, or 1.9%, to 7380.5 points, its lowest close in more than five weeks. Mining stocks and energy firms led the fallers, as new curbs in China could hit demand for metals, coal and oil. Anglo American lost 6.85%, BP fell 6.2% and Glencore dropped 5.6%. Stocks fell across Europe, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index losing 1.8% despite relief that Emmanuel Macron had won Sunday’s French presidential election. Wall Street initially added to Friday’s losses, with the S&P 500 down 1% by midday, although it later rallied to close 0.6% higher. The yield, or interest rate, on UK, US and eurozone government bonds fell, a sign that investors were seeking a safe-haven asset and anticipating slower growth. “More than two years into the pandemic and Covid is still roiling financial markets,” said Fawad Razaqzada, a market analyst at City Index and Forex.com. “Concerns about demand have intensified after Beijing locked down parts of Chaoyang district as the virus spread there. This triggered panic as people had hoped that lockdowns would ease in Shanghai rather than more restrictions being imposed elsewhere. But now the prospects of the capital city being put into a full lockdown has unnerved investors worldwide.” Economists warned that China’s efforts to stick to its zero-Covid strategy could mean further lockdowns, disrupting global supply chains over the coming months, and adding to inflation. “Without a major overhaul of quarantine rules, the economic damage due to Omicron will likely increase,” predicted Frédérique Carrier, the head of investment strategy in Britain and Asia at RBC Wealth Management. “Premier Li Keqiang has repeatedly warned of growth risks this month, and the State Council and related government departments have ordered local authorities to minimise transportation and logistics disruptions when imposing local quarantines. “Domestic logistics and port operations disruptions may spill over to regional or global supply chains. In addition, some cities under lockdown in southern and eastern China are manufacturing hubs for electronic products, chips, and electric vehicles. Exports are likely to slow more meaningfully in the coming months.” Benchmark China iron ore futures dropped almost 11% to the lowest in more than a month, on concerns that demand from the steel industry could weaken. Palladium, used in car catalytic converters, slumped more than 10%. Oil prices tumbled more than 6%, with Brent crude dropping below $100 ($78.60) a barrel for the first time in almost two weeks. “The world’s biggest crude importer is heading for the worst oil demand shock since early 2020,” said Ole Hansen, the head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank. “Supply worries have not suddenly disappeared, with Libyan supply disruptions as well as sanctions and a potential widening ban against Russian crude oil import also lingering. For now, however, the market is in risk-off mode.” Fears that the US central bank will aggressively raise interest rates this year also hit markets, after signals from several Federal Reserve officials that they will tighten policy to pull down inflation.

4/26/2022,"The British public has “run out of patience” with English football’s failure to reform itself, the sports minister, Nigel Huddleston, has said, as he confirmed legislation for an independent regulator would be in place before the next general election. The government has endorsed 10 key principles in Tracey Crouch’s fan-led review into football governance, with a new regulator the central idea among them. Huddleston said government also expects the Premier League to distribute more money across the football pyramid and for a solution to be agreed with the Football League before the summer. “We’ve all got incredibly frustrated over years, in fact decades, of football recognising it’s got problems and singularly failing to sort them out,” Huddleston said. “Quite frankly I think the British public, and football fans in particular, have run out of patience and there is a need to intervene.” While responses to the government’s decision to support the Crouch review were largely positive, some, including Crouch herself, said the lack of a timeline for delivery of new legislation was “worrying”. Huddleston insisted the government had committed to bringing a regulator into law before the next election, which is currently scheduled for 2024. “There are some people expecting this is going to happen tomorrow or next week and there are other people thinking it’s two years but we do have the commitment to get this done before the next election,” he said. “We want to move forward quickly because we know there’s overwhelming demand for this and we know the problems in football. But, if we implemented it tomorrow, we could have exactly the opposite impact of what we are intending: making sure that clubs can survive and that they are financially sustainable.” Huddleston said that details on the regulator’s powers would be published this summer as part of a white paper, including possible measures to ensure greater financial redistribution within the English game. In its response to the fan-led review the government said that such a settlement should be agreed within football, ie between the Premier League and EFL directly, but it later confirmed that such an outcome needs to be confirmed by the summer. “I think the message to the Premier League is quite clear,” Huddleston said. “They need to act sooner rather than later because, otherwise, it will be forced on them through the regulator.” The sports minister said he encouraged football to take pro-active measures on other recommendations from the report, such as creating better representation for supporters and ensuring the preservation of assets of ‘cultural heritage’ like football stadiums, so as to avoid the possibility of those solutions being imposed by government too. Huddleston said there were those within his own party who are “very uncomfortable with this level of intervention we’re proposing”, but the Conservative government now looks to have committed itself fully to independent regulation of one of the country’s greatest culture exports. As one headline within the government’s official response put it: “The free market will not rectify the problems.”",Sport/Football,"Public ‘out of patience’ with football’s failure to reform, says sports minister",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/25/british-public-has-run-out-of-patience-with-football-failure-reform
4/26/2022,"Almost 1,000 Ukrainian families who applied for visas under the UK government’s Homes for Ukraine scheme are still waiting for the applications to be processed more than a month after submitting them. One would-be host, Lauren Corbishley, who has founded a protest group about the delays, said the failure to issue visas to some of those who applied at the beginning of the scheme was “torture” for the families. She called on the government to launch a public inquiry into what has gone wrong. A group of would-be hosts protested outside parliament on Monday and met MPs including Theresa May and Steve Baker. They presented the MPs with a dossier of 986 cases where visas have been applied for but not yet granted. Of these, 866 applied in the first two weeks of the scheme, which opened on 18 March. The government did not respond to claims from UK hosts and Ukrainian families that visa applications submitted early on in the scheme had gone astray, pointing out instead that the Home Office was now processing thousands of cases a day. Two of the protesters at parliament, Debbie and Trevor Farnfield, helped the family they hope to sponsor apply for visas on 24 March. The family fled from Ukraine to Poland and are sleeping on mattresses in a gym outside Warsaw. The parents and two children have been granted visas but a third sibling has not, which means the whole family have been unable to travel to the UK. The Farnfields held up photos of the family at the Westminster protest. “We wanted to help Ukrainian refugees because we have a family-size home but no longer have all of our family living in it,” Debbie Farnfield said. “We could not live with our consciences if we didn’t help out.” They and the family they want to support are frustrated by the delays. “The visa system has become a national embarrassment,” said Trevor Farnfield. Jo Wright, a wheelchair user, is trying to host a Ukrainian Paralympic athlete, Svitlana Tryfonova, and her two children. Wright has an accessible home and wanted a Ukrainian with a disability to be able to benefit from it. “The family have been living in a three-storey building with no lift, so Svitlana’s sons have been carrying her up and down the stairs,” Wright said. “We booked them on to a flight to the UK today but we’re still waiting for the visas so had to cancel the flight.” Visas for Tryfonova and her elder son have been processed but the family are still waiting for a visa for the younger son. A group called Vigil for Visas is calling on the government to simplify the visa process, allow applications to be tracked in real time and end the delays that they say could prove deadly for people trapped in a war zone. Corbishley’s group, Protest Over Missing Visa Applications 18-25 March 2022, is another highlighting the problems many are having with getting UK visas. A government spokesperson said: “Thanks to the generosity of the public who have offered their homes to Ukrainians fleeing the war and through the Ukraine family scheme, more than 71,800 visas have been granted with 21,600 Ukrainians arriving safely in the UK. The Home Office is now processing thousands of visas a day – this shows the changes made to streamline the service are working and we’ll continue to build on this success so we can speed up the process even further.”",News/UK news,Homes for Ukraine hosts protest over Home Office visa delays,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/25/homes-for-ukraine-hosts-protest-over-home-office-visa-delays
