4/13/2022,"Russians are forcibly sending Ukrainians to remote regions in Russia, Ukrainian officials said. The Kremlin plans on sending them as far as Siberia and the Arctic Circle, The i reported. Nearly 100,000 Ukrainians will be sent to these regions, The i said, citing a Kremlin document. Russia plans to send nearly 100,000 Ukrainians as far as Siberia and the Arctic Circle, UK newspaper The i reported, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned of ""special filtration camps"" for captured people. A Kremlin document, cited by The i, shows Russia made an emergency order last month to forcibly move 95,739 Ukrainians to far-away regions in Russia. The document suggests that Ukrainians will not be sent to major cities like Moscow or St. Petersburg, but rather to remote areas located thousands of miles away from their homes. The areas include the Siberian town of Magadan, the Arctic port of Murmansk, and the Caucasus regions of Chechnya, Ingushetia, and Dagestan, according to The i. Some Ukrainians are also being sent as far as Sakhalin — a Russian island in the Pacific Ocean, located just north of Japan — The i reported. The regions have reportedly been told to update Moscow on new arrivals monthly. The report comes after Ukrainian officials accused Russia of moving thousands of people from Mariupol — a heavily bombarded southern port city in Ukraine — to so-called ""filtration camps"" along the border before forcibly relocating them to far-away regions in Russia. In a speech to the Lithuanian parliament on Tuesday, Zelenskyy said: ""There are mass deportations of people from the occupied areas. Hundreds of thousands of people have already been deported."" ""They are placed in special filtration camps,"" he added. ""Documents are taken away from them. They are interrogated and humiliated. It is unknown how many are killed."" The Mariupol City Council said last month that Russians kidnapped 20,000 of the besieged city's residents. Several women from Mariupol who said they were forced to go to the ""filtration camps"" have since spoken to media outlets, including The Guardian and The Washington Post, about what their experience was like. One unnamed woman told the Post that she was brought via bus to the Ukrainian border town of Novoazovsk after Russian soldiers found her sheltering in an underground bunker. Once in Novoazovsk, the woman told the post she was interrogated by men who said they were part of the Russian security service, the FSB. She said she was photographed and fingerprinted and also had to hand over her phone and passwords. ""At all stages of the journey, we were treated like captives or some criminals. I felt like a sack of potatoes tossed around,"" the woman told the Post. Another unnamed woman told The Guardian that she, alongside ""two or three hundred"" others, faced interrogation and had her personal items confiscated at the ""filtration camp"" in Novoazovsk. ""It was very degrading,"" she told The Guardian about the interrogation. Both women were able to break away from their groups and managed to escape to Europe, according to the Post and The Guardian. Russia has denied that anyone from Ukraine is being relocated against their will, the Post reported. Last month, the Kremlin said it had rescued 420,000 people ""from dangerous regions of Ukraine, the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics"" and evacuated them to Russia, according to the Post.

4/13/2022,"By Mark Trevelyan and Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen LONDON (Reuters) - Russia can afford to wage a long war in Ukraine despite being hammered by Western sanctions aimed at crippling its ability to sustain the campaign, defence experts and economists say. Russia's invasion has driven up the price of the oil, gas and grain it exports, providing it with a substantial windfall to fund its ""special military operation"" - now entering a new phase as Moscow focuses on the eastern Donbas region after failing to break Ukraine's defence of the capital Kyiv. As the war grinds on, rising casualties and the need to rotate fresh troops into battle may prove more pressing challenges than the financial cost. ""This type of low-tech war can be financed almost entirely in roubles, which means they can continue pouring troops and heavy artillery into Ukraine at least until there's a more general collapse of the economy,"" said Jacob Kirkegaard, economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. Johan Norberg, senior analyst at the Swedish Defence Research Agency, said: ""The sanctions will not affect this war in the short run, because Russia's military is fighting with tanks it had already built and soldiers it had already trained."" Sanctions are expected to shrink the economy by more than 11% this year, the World Bank says, but revenues from energy exports are actually increasing. The Russian finance ministry said on April 5 that Moscow expects to earn $9.6 billion in additional revenue from energy sales in April alone thanks to high oil prices, which remain around $100 a barrel. There is no doubt, however, that Russia's vaunted military machine has taken a huge and costly hit. The United States assesses that Russia has lost about 15-20% of its combat power during its invasion of Ukraine, a senior U.S. defence official said. That includes everything from tanks, armoured vehicles, artillery systems, fighter and bomber aircraft and helicopters to surface-to-air and ballistic missiles, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. LOST TANKS According to Oryx, a closely watched military blog which tallies both sides' losses based on verifiable visual evidence, Russia had lost at least 2,770 items of military equipment as of Tuesday, including at least 476 tanks that had been destroyed, damaged, abandoned or captured. That, said Yohann Michel of the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), is more than the combined tank strength of NATO members France (222) and Britain (227). Russia, which had around 3,000 tanks before the war, according to IISS figures, is not about to run out. But experts said some of those are likely to be old, in poor condition or held for spare parts, so the effective number available for combat is lower. Mathieu Boulegue, a specialist in the Russian military at Chatham House, said Moscow had so far held back its most modern weaponry, which it is reluctant to lose, and relied heavily on an abundance of more expendable Soviet-era hardware. He said it could take ""a decade or two at least"" to rebuild equipment levels to where they were before the war - a task complicated by a host of factors including design and innovation challenges, corruption, the indebted state of defence companies and a lack of access to Western microelectronics because of sanctions. DEFENCE BURDEN Russian military spending will need to rise both because of the war with Ukraine and the resulting sharp increase in tension with NATO, which has sent thousands more troops to eastern Europe, said Richard Connolly, an associate fellow at RUSI in London and director of the Eastern Advisory Group consultancy. He said defence spending as a share of GDP could rise significantly from its current level of around 4%, potentially doubling in the next few years. Connolly said ordinary Russians would feel the impact but the state could comfortably pay for the war effort, even if its economy is plunged into recession. If necessary it could commandeer resources like fuel from state-owned companies. The more pressing question, he said, was the level of casualties and the difficulty of sustaining a war involving up to 150,000 troops at a time. Russia has so far acknowledged only 1,351 troops killed and 3,825 wounded, although Ukraine and Western governments believe the toll is many times higher. Its army and airborne troops have a combined strength of about 325,000. Eventually, Connolly said, it may have to take the politically unpopular decision to dip into its reserves, which the IISS estimates to number 2 million men under 50 with military service within the past five years. ""If you’ve got 150,000 committed to Ukraine, you’ve got half of your effective army currently in combat operations, many of which have experienced significant losses,"" Connolly said. ""So they’re going to need to replace, they’re going to need to rotate them. They're using their entire army, basically - or they will be if this goes on for very much longer.""

4/13/2022,"STORY: Ukraine officials said Tuesday (April 12) it was checking reports chemical weapons were used by Russian forces in the besieged port city of Mariupol. Hours earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy referred to the possibility in his nightly video address. ""Today we heard a statement from the occupiers confirming they are preparing for a new stage in their terror against us and our defenders. One of the spokespeople of the invaders said they are considering using chemical weapons against the defenders of Mariupol. We take it very seriously. I want to remind world leaders that a possible use of chemical weapons had been already discussed by the Russian military. At the time it meant the reaction to the Russian aggression should have been harsher and faster."" Zelenskiy did not provide any other detail on the claim. The Russian defense ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. British defense minister James Heappey said it was trying to verify the report. ""We are working urgently to understand whether or not chemical weapons have been used and if they have, as the foreign secretary has said, the people responsible will be held to account. The use of chemical weapons is abhorrent; it does cross a line and all options are on the table for how we would respond."" Should the reports be confirmed, it would mark a dangerous new development in the conflict, which is now firmly focused on the east of the country. The battle for the key port town of Mariupol is reaching a decisive phase, with Ukrainian marines holed up in the Azovstal industrial district. Russian victory there would create the land corridor it's been seeking between areas it holds to the west and east. Civilians continued to flee from areas of eastern Ukraine on Tuesday ahead of the anticipated Russian offensive. President Vladimir Putin calls his action in Ukraine a ""special military operation"" to demilitarize and ""denazify"" the country. The Russian leader said Tuesday that it would undoubtedly achieve what he said were its ""noble"" objectives.",Politics/Reuters Videos,Concern over possible use of chemical weapons in Ukraine,https://news.yahoo.com/concern-over-possible-chemical-weapons-122627635.html
4/13/2022,"""My doctor told me I was lucky that my trip to the ER didn’t reveal something more serious,"" the author writes. (Photo: Patchanu Noree / EyeEm via Getty Images) When I saw the blood in the toilet bowl, I decided it was time to go to the emergency room. I had been doubled over in pain for the better part of three hours. It started out as par for the course: I had grown accustomed to semi-regular stomach problems that left me stuck in a bathroom as my abdomen wrung itself out. I assumed it was just how my body behaved. I had considered that maybe I was dealing with irritable bowel syndrome, but I never pursued a diagnosis after several doctors didn’t seem concerned during my yearly physicals. The blood, though. That was new. At the hospital, I was escorted to the examining room right away, where I was given fluids and bloodwork. Some time later, a doctor came in. He, like all the others before him, was unconcerned. After normal test results, he sent me on my way with a suggestion to see a specialist. The pain eventually subsided, but the blood didn’t right away. For days, I held my breath whenever I went into the bathroom. My follow-up with a gastroenterologist wasn’t for two months (shout out to the health care system!), but something was nagging at me, telling me I needed to go sooner. I am so grateful I listened to that instinct. I found someone who was able to see me, and while the bleeding had mostly subsided by that point, he scheduled a colonoscopy. The prep was miserable (if I never eat lemon jello again, it will be too soon), but the anxiety was even worse. The day of my procedure, I remember feeling appreciative for the anesthesia for taking me out of my head a bit. When I woke up, my doctor delivered news I didn’t expect: I had multiple ulcers on one part of my colon. Several biopsy results and an MRI later, he came to a conclusion: My birth control pill, which I had been on nonstop since I was 17, was possibly the cause. This diagnosis was essentially a best guess. The biopsies, bloodwork and MRI ruled out conditions like Crohn’s disease, blood vessel problems and ulcerative colitis. The tests did show that the ulcers were because of an ischemic event, which is why I was in so much pain before I went to the ER. Typically, this issue happens in older people. An ischemic event occurs when blood supply is reduced to a certain part of the body. In my case, it was my sigmoid colon, which is the last part of the bowel. It’s uncommon to see it in a young, otherwise healthy woman. In some cases where it has happened to other people, the patient was on the combination pill, i.e. the birth control pill that contains estrogen. My doctor couldn’t guarantee this was the reason with 100% certainty, since this condition is understudied. What little research exists on the subject suggests that the estrogen in the pill could be to blame, but it’s “not clearly understood,” according to experts. My doctor’s other theory was that I had an infection of some sort that caused the ulcers. Regardless, he urged me to switch to a different method of birth control as soon as possible, just to eliminate that as a possible cause. Without the oral contraceptives or an acute infection causing the issue, my bowel should heal and my blood flow should go back to normal. I don’t have an official follow-up plan in place yet, but I imagine my gastro doctor will want to check back in the near future to make sure everything is healing as it’s supposed to. My doctor told me I was lucky that my trip to the ER didn’t reveal something more serious. The worst-case (and very rare) scenario was the risk of bowel necrosis, which is when the cells in your colon die due to reduced blood flow. It can be fatal. Until that moment, I thought that a diagnosis would be freeing. However, it ended up feeling paralyzing. I had gone on the pill nearly 15 years ago to help with acne and cramping during my periods. No one gave me any information at the time beyond “take it at the same time every day.” Overall, I was happy with it. My skin cleared. My periods became more tolerable. I didn’t experience any of the intense side effects that some of my friends had over the years. I continued taking the same prescription through college and then when I moved to New York. The pill almost felt like a security blanket for me. I never considered any other option after I left my initial appointment; it never even occurred to me that there could be underlying health effects. The pill almost felt like a security blanket for me. I never considered any other option after I left my initial appointment; it never even occurred to me that there could be underlying health effects. Doctors never told me about them; I didn’t read the packets that come with the medication, which are as thick as a book; and the benefits certainly outweighed the potential risks. Now, here I was over a decade later, and it was leaving me cold. You’d think making the choice to go off the pill would be a relatively easy one ― after all, my health was at stake ― but it wasn’t. I agonized over thoughts of hormonal acne taking over my face again, just in time for my wedding in May. I cried over the prospect of dealing with painful and unpredictable periods. I dreaded the very likely excruciating insertion of an IUD, which was my first-choice alternative if I ended up making the decision to stay on contraceptives.  After a ton of deliberation and more urging from my gastro, I stopped taking the pill and switched to the hormonal IUD, which doesn’t contain estrogen. I still very much support birth control in any form, including the pill. If I could still be on it, I would be. I just wish I knew more about the medicine I had been taking for 15 years. I wish there were more research on it for cases like me, so women could get a definitive diagnosis instead of a best guess. We can’t make informed decisions about our health care if our doctors are feeling around in the dark as they try to help us. Luckily, my gastro did as much investigating as he could until he found a logical and satisfactory explanation. I was shocked he made the connection. So was my gynecologist, when I told her (and after examining my case, she agreed with his assessment). Other people won’t be as lucky to have a team of health care professionals who spend the time searching for a solution — especially if there’s very little data to back it up. This is purely speculation, but I would guess that if Viagra caused reduced blood flow to the colon, there probably would be a lot more research on that. It’s simple to advise people to be their own health advocates, but doing that requires a certain level of privilege: You have to have medical professionals who believe you when you say something is wrong. You have to be able to confer with doctors who are willing to think outside of common explanations. You have to have health care coverage to see specialists in the first place.  It’s only been a month since I went off birth control, and thankfully I haven’t had any bleeding or stomach problems since my original incident (nor have I had the other side effects that I was worried about ― please send good vibes to my skin). I don’t know if that’s a coincidence or if it’s because we targeted the issue. I’m hoping my diagnosis is correct, and that changing my contraceptive is the solution to my problem.  Women’s health care ― all the way down to the research level ― is still nowhere close to what it should be. This is especially true when it comes to birth control, but it’s the case in too many other areas as well. We have to speak up for our health, and we have to be willing to ask hard questions ― sometimes over and over again ― and push back as often as necessary until we feel heard. I was fortunate it didn’t cost me my life. One day, someone else might not be so lucky.
