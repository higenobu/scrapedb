4/22/2022,"In the chaos of the twisty government U-turns before Thursday’s Partygate inquiry debate, MPs could be forgiven for losing sight of the significance of the moment. Stepping back from the internal politics, the heart of the matter is: Boris Johnson’s own MPs put so much pressure on party whips that the prime minister will now be formally investigated over whether he is in contempt of parliament for lying over lockdown parties. According to the ministerial code, this is a resigning matter. There have been many predictions about what may ultimately finish Johnson, but none have proved right so far. Even after the prime minister was found to have broken his own laws so egregiously that he was fined – and he is expected to face repeated fines – still most MPs believe he should be given the benefit of the doubt. But with an investigation by the privileges committee now certain, Johnson is once again in uncharted territory. The committee, which has six MPs who will examine the case after its Labour chair Chris Bryant recused himself, will be asked to form a view on whether what Johnson did was a resigning matter. The temptation would be to dismiss this as yet another investigation into the same issue – but it may well have very different consequences. It opens up the possibility of MPs requesting the release of damaging new messages or photographs, though that is not guaranteed. Its inquiry will produce a report to determine if Johnson was in contempt of parliament for having lied, and it can recommend punishments such as the suspension or expulsion of the prime minister. All of that is unlikely in practice. The committee has a Conservative majority and is expected to be chaired by the senior Brexiter backbencher Sir Bernard Jenkin. Its final recommendation, if it included a censure, would require a Commons vote. But it should also be said that many unlikely things have already happened – including Conservative whips being forced by their own MPs to allow this inquiry to take place in the first place. Without a doubt, the inquiry will further prolong the agony of Tory MPs. But, most crucially, this third investigation into lockdown-breaking could be the one that leads to the narrow circumstance that Johnson has conceded could be a resigning matter. Johnson has been bullish about remaining in post in the aftermath of the first two investigation into his behaviour – the Whitehall inquiry by Sue Gray and the Metropolitan police inquiry. Speaking to journalists en route to India this week, he said he would not resign in any circumstance and that he would fight the next election. But this third inquiry is different. Johnson has previously acknowledged, in a roundabout way, that the ministerial code would compel him to resign if he misled the House of Commons. At prime minister’s questions in January, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, read out a clause from the ministerial code: “Ministers who knowingly mislead parliament will be expected to offer their resignation.” Asked if that rule applies to him, Johnson said “of course” though he added: “Let me tell the House that I think he is inviting a question about an investigation … which he, as a lawyer, will know that I can’t comment on.” That has proved to be a shrewd move from Labour – which has now paid off. Over the past 48 hours Labour’s tactics have also been sharp. Its motion anticipated that Tory MPs would require the new Partygate investigation to take place after the Met concludes its work, so it was included in its motion. And Bryant struck a deal with Tory MPs, recusing himself from the privileges committee just as whips were using his chairmanship as a reason to oppose the inquiry. There is wriggle room when it comes to misleading parliament, because the crucial word is “knowingly” and this forms a key part of Johnson’s defence. He told MPs “it did not occur to me” that the lockdown breach for which he was fined, a birthday gathering in the cabinet room in June 2020, was against the rules. Yet the chaos this week suggests the prime minister’s party management is in worse straits than has been widely reported. With the new inquiry guaranteed to keep Partygate in the headlines for months, more and more MPs may begin to feel Johnson is running out of excuses.",News/Politics,New inquiry into Boris Johnson could be the one that delivers the fatal blow,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/21/new-inquiry-into-boris-johnson-could-be-the-one-that-delivers-the-fatal-blow

4/22/2022,"Wimbledon has been warned it could face legal action from the Belarusian Tennis Federation after it accused the All England Club of acting illegally by banning Russian and Belarusian players from this summer’s championships. The BTF said it was consulting international law firms to “protect” its stars, including the two-time grand slam champion Victoria Azarenka and the world No 4, Aryna Sabalenka, as it condemned Wimbledon for inciting hatred with its decision. “The Belarusian Tennis Federation categorically condemns the decision taken by the organisers of Wimbledon to suspend Belarusian and Russian tennis players,” it said. “Such destructive actions in no way contribute to the resolution of conflicts, but only incite hatred and intolerance on a national basis. “Throughout the history of tennis, armed conflicts have occurred in the world – in Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, Yugoslavia and other countries – but never until now have tournament organisers suspended athletes from the United States, Great Britain and other countries,” it added. “Illegal decisions of international tennis organisations in relation to our athletes undermine the reputation of these organisations.” It is understood that Wimbledon took legal advice before making its decision, which will significantly alter the makeup of the tournament given 17 of the Top 100 in the men’s and women’s rankings, including the world No 2, Daniil Medvedev, are from Russia or Belarus. However the BTF said it was still exploring ways to challenge it. “At the moment, consultations of the BTF leadership with international law firms on sports law are ongoing and a strategy is being developed that is aimed at protecting, first of all, Belarusian tennis players around the world, and tennis in the Republic of Belarus as a whole,” it said. Wimbledon’s decision has also been criticised by the ATP and WTA, which run the men’s and women’s tours, as well as Martina Navratilova and Novak Djokovic. Navratilova, who won Wimbledon a record nine times between 1978 and 1990, called the move “wrong”, adding: “Exclusion like this, through no fault of these players, is not the way to go. Tennis is such a democratic sport it is difficult when you see politics destroy it. Djokovic, meanwhile, said that while he understood the emotional trauma of war given Serbia’s history, he was also against the decision. “I think it is crazy,” he added. “When politics interferes with sport, the result is not good.” But Wimbledon’s move was welcomed by the former Ukrainian star Alex Dolgopolov, who said it would make those in Russia understand its leaders were acting illegally. “Wimbledon isn’t going to stop the war, it’s just an extra sign of the world condemning Putin,” he told the Independent. “The more of these signals, if it’s tennis or if it’s Fifa blocking them from football, it shows people that Russia is doing something wrong.” Meanwhile three current Ukrainian tennis stars – Elina Svitolina, Marta Kostyuk and Sergiy Stakhovsky – have called on players from Russia and Belarus to denounce their government if they want to compete at international level. “We noticed that some Russian and Belarusian players at some point vaguely mentioned the war, but never clearly stating that Russia and Belarus started it on the territory of Ukraine,” they said in a social media post. “The very silence of those who choose to remain that way is unbearable as it leads to the continuation of murder in our homeland.” The players also called on the WTA, ATP and ITF to ask such players a series of questions about whether they supported the invasion of Ukraine and the regimes of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and Belarus’ leader, Alexander Lukashenko “There comes a time when silence is betrayal, and that time is now,” they added.",Sport/Sport,Wimbledon may face legal action over ban on Russian and Belarusian players,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/21/wimbledon-may-face-legal-action-over-ban-on-russian-and-belarusian-players
4/22/2022,"A senior Bank of England policymaker has warned that Britain’s central bank could raise rates again next month to combat the risk of high inflation persisting into 2023. Catherine Mann, a former Citigroup economist who joined the BoE’s nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC) last year, said on Thursday that soaring prices of energy and food will persist next year, even if consumer demand weakens. Some economists have forecast the UK economy will shrink in the second quarter and possibly fall into recession following a collapse in consumer and business confidence in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that is likely to worsen shortages of goods and push inflation to fresh highs. However, Mann said it was important for the central bank to calm inflation expectations, which were likely to drive demands for higher wages, pushing inflation even higher. “The domestic inflation ratchet … has been my central concern,” she said in a speech. In February when the MPC voted for a 0.25% increase in the base rate she voted with a minority for a sharper 0.5% increase. Last month she voted with almost all other members for a 0.25% rise, taking the base rate to 0.75%. She said: “Monetary policy needs to keep inflation expectations anchored; by doing so now, less tightening will be required later, when demand may still be weak.” The BoE will meet on 5 May to decide on the path of interest rates at a time when most households have begun to absorb a rise in national insurance contributions and a freeze on income tax thresholds that will push hundreds of thousands of taxpayers into higher tax brackets. Inflation hit a 30-year high of 7% in March, and the BoE last month warned that the bigger-than-expected pickup in prices would squeeze growth later this year. However, Mann said it was not obvious to her that this fall in consumer demand would come soon enough to prompt businesses to rein in upcoming price rises. “Tracking these price expectations and forecast revisions is of paramount importance since inflation ultimately is due to firms systematically able to raise their prices,” she said. Moreover, staged energy price increases designed to smooth the recent shock increase in wholesale costs would extend the period of high inflation. “The underlying inflation ratchet associated with lagged CPI in firms’ pricing expectations will imply more persistence in keeping inflationary pressures above target,” she said. Financial markets expect Mann and the rest of the MPC to increase the base rate to 2.25% by the end of the year. However, many economists expect the biggest collapse in real disposable household incomes since records began in 1948 to force a U-turn. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: “We doubt the MPC will be so cavalier as to hike Bank Rate to 2.25%.” He said a 0.25% rise in May and another in August would be the most UK borrowers could expect as the economic situation worsened. Danny Blanchflower, a former MPC member and professor of economics at US Ivy League university Dartmouth College, said the BoE would be blamed for depressing household incomes at a time of rising poverty. He said Mann’s concern that inflation would persist, driven by an explosion in wage demands, was based on “no evidence”. “There is nothing in the survey evidence to show that households or financial markets believe inflation is going to last and no evidence that workers have the clout to increase wages by more than inflation. “All the evidence points to there being a recession around the corner driven by higher taxes, rising energy and food costs and an evidence-free increase in interest rates,” he said.",News/Business,Bank of England’s Catherine Mann warns rates could rise again in May,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/21/bank-of-englands-catherine-mann-warns-rates-could-rise-again-in-may
4/22/2022,"There are many solutions to the problems in our asylum system, but they all begin with a sense of humanity apparently unknown to the present government (Priti Patel: Rwanda plan critics ‘fail to offer their own solutions’, 18 April). Finding solutions means, first, accepting responsibility for those over whom the United Kingdom exercises authority and control; second, it means cooperating with France and other EU countries in providing protection for refugees; third, it requires working with the source countries of refugees to find ways of assisting their citizens, either to remain and work there, or to return in safety and dignity. Fourth, if the asylum system is indeed broken, a solution that is based on humanity will not turn on refugees, but on the system that is not working; not the 1951 convention or human rights, but a dysfunctional Home Office that is now beyond repair. The solution here is to remove decisions from the Home Office and entrust them to an independent refugee and protection agency. This is not a new idea, but it has never received the attention that it needs, because senior bureaucrats and politicians appear to enjoy playing football with others’ lives to generate the fears and apprehensions that are believed to be key to electoral success, or to open up contracts for the corporate “friends” of the government. And finally, find another home secretary, preferably one who, unlike Priti Patel or Theresa May, is in touch with humanity.Prof Guy S Goodwin-GillEmeritus fellow, All Souls College, Oxford University  How to deal with people smugglers? Simple: allow people entry to the UK for the purpose of claiming asylum, as many other countries do, thus at a stroke removing the need for traffickers. Allow all refugees, not just Ukrainian ones, to work and claim full benefits immediately. The £120m that has already been being paid to Rwanda could have been spent on additional Home Office caseworkers, enabling the enormous backlog of cases to be dealt with, and new cases to be determined in weeks rather than (in many cases) years. The appeals system is incredibly laborious, partly because Home Office caseworkers don’t have time to prepare responses, so cases are repeatedly adjourned.Mike LowensteinLudham, Norfolk  Here is a solution that would work: we need to have a cooperative agreement with France and the EU to set up processing centres in France (or indeed elsewhere in the EU) where asylum seekers could get their claims assessed rapidly and efficiently. Anyone landing in a small boat in Britain would immediately be flown back to one of these centres. This would wipe out the criminal gangs that organise the crossings. This would, however, mean an incredible culture shift in the Home Office, to becoming an organisation that exists to help people, not just to put barriers in the way of people.Peter BrayneSheringham, Norfolk  The UK is still receiving applications for asylum from Rwandans (13 were received in 2020, the most recently reported year).

4/22/2022,"My friend and colleague Martin Stevens, who has died aged 57 from Covid-related complications, was a senior research fellow at the health and social care workforce research unit at King’s College London for the past 18 years. During his career Martin chaired the UK Social Services Research Group and the Health Research Authority social care research ethics committee, in which roles he contributed much to developing ethics and governance in social care research. At his death he was chair of the Good Mental Health Co-operative committee as well as being an adviser to the National Institute for Health Research’s research design service. Martin was born in Duffield, Derbyshire, to Jill (nee Roberts), a teacher, and Paul Stevens, an educational psychologist. He went to the Arnewood school in New Milton, Hampshire, and then was educated at the universities of Southampton, where he studied philosophy as an undergraduate, and Surrey and Portsmouth, where he gained his PhD. He began his career as a residential services officer for Hampshire county council’s social services department, before becoming a research officer in the department in 1992. He was appointed as a research fellow at King’s College in 2004 and was made senior fellow 10 years later. Martin was loved as well as respected by colleagues. He had an exceptional ability to analyse complex problems from various perspectives, helping to provide valuable insights for health practitioners, managers and policymakers with clear and well-considered recommendations. I worked with him at King’s College and his kindness, generosity, sense of fun and good humour made him a wonderful colleague. Throughout most of his adult life Martin lived with chronic health problems after kidney failure, which led to years of dialysis and three kidney transplants: experiences that led him to develop a deep insight into, and empathy for, the needs of other health and care service users. His death is a huge loss to those who knew him, as well as the wider social care research community to which he contributed so much.

4/22/2022,"I hear what Owen Jones has to say about France and, as a French national living in the UK, I can only agree that in the last 20 years, far-right ideas have slowly but surely taken root in French public opinion and politics, and that only a united left may revert this, not Emmanuel Macron (A win for Macron will not be a complete defeat for France’s far right, 20 April). That Macron said Philippe Pétain was a great soldier is an inadequate case in point though. Pétain was a first world war hero – that’s the uneasy truth that Macron was acknowledging. I also wish Jones had drawn clearer parallels with the UK and exposed how, since Brexit, the far right has infiltrated British (English?) public opinion, the Conservative party, the government and its policies – think immigration, the report on racial disparities, attacks on the right to demonstrate, the BBC and Channel 4, etc. In effect, the far right is already in power in the UK. Compared with Boris Johnson, Macron is a liberal and a centrist – far too centre-right for the French left, that’s for sure. But Jones should bear in mind that, unlike the British, the French are very good at complaining about and protesting against their governments, and that, unlike first past the post, their voting system – which they do not shy away from using – allows them to express that clearly, for better or worse.Angèle David-GuillouLondon  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

4/22/2022,"Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen have ramped up their campaigning with a hectic schedule of last-minute visits to attract floating voters, as France’s hotly contested presidential race enters its final hours. While the vote is on Sunday, under French election rules all campaigning and opinion polling must end by midnight on Friday, and on Thursday the two candidates rushed to squeeze in time on the road. Le Pen headed to Arras, in her northern stronghold, for a rally while Macron entered more hostile ground in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis, where the radical-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon scored more than 60% of the first-round vote almost two weeks ago. On Wednesday night the two candidates took part in an almost three-hour debate from which Macron emerged narrowly victorious, but which was also seen as unlikely to have changed many voters’ intentions, with the president accused of being arrogant and Le Pen of lacking credibility as a potential leader. At the rally, Le Pen returned to the previous evening’s clash, criticising her rival. “I had in front of me an Emmanuel Macron who was very sure of himself, very contemptuous, very arrogant, including in his posture,” she said, “This did not surprise any French person, I think.” The far-right candidate said the re-election of Macron would bring “social devastation”. “He will no longer be limited by anything … it would be even worse than the first mandate,” she said. “I will explain to them [the French] that another choice is possible. They must vote by listening to their reason and their heart.” Macron was greeted by Saint-Denis’s Socialist mayor, Mathieu Hanotin, who unlike others on the left has called for voters to back Macron on Sunday. The president dismissed Le Pen’s accusations. “When you have no more arguments to counter [the issues] you have to look for something else,” he said. Macron said the debate had been “respectful” but that “madame says lots of bizarre things, between you and me”. He added: “I think for people things are now clear. There’s a project to reinforce Europe … and a project that means the end of Europe.” Le Pen’s programme was “imprecise”, he said, and he questioned how she was going to finance it. “Our compatriots will make their decision on Sunday. Right up to the last minute nothing is decided,” he said. Macron promised more investment in poor districts such as Saint-Denis, including increased funding for schools and to help underprivileged young people find work. Hanotin said that if Le Pen won on Sunday it would be a “catastrophe” for poor and socially mixed areas such as Saint-Denis. “We must concentrate on how we mobilise to choose the republic next Sunday. That’s the reason that despite our differences I have supported Mr Macron.” Wednesday’s marathon face-off between the two candidates was considered a key moment before Sunday’s vote. It was a rematch of 2017’s TV debate, during which the far-right leader became aggressive. This time Le Pen remained calm, though she still floundered occasionally. Le Monde likened Macron to a boa constrictor, slowly squeezing his rival to death. The interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, said it was overall a satisfactory debate. “If the presidential campaign itself has been disappointing, here we saw the choice between two kinds of France, two different visions,” he told Europe 1 radio. Jordan Bardella, the head of Le Pen’s National Rally, accused Macron of being the “No 1 public insult thrower”, adding: “When he insults Marine Le Pen as do his supporters, he is really insulting the French.” Clément Beaune, the Europe minister, accused Le Pen of seeking to organise a Frexit by stealth. “On this subject it was clear that Marine Le Pen did not have a project and that she had just cut her Frexit into smaller pieces,” he said. Gabriel Attal, a government spokesperson, said Le Pen had “changed her style but not the substance”. He accused her of wanting to “divide the French”, echoing Macron’s accusation that her proposed ban on the Islamic headscarf in public places would cause “civil war” in city suburbs. About 15.6 million people watched the debate, fewer than the 16.6 million in 2017. The figure did not include those watching online. The pollsters Elabe questioned viewers after the debate and declared that 59% found Macron more convincing, compared with 39% for Le Pen. Among supporters of Mélenchon, whose 7.7 million voters the two remaining candidates are chasing, the poll found 61% judged Macron convincing against 36% for Le Pen. Only 29% of those asked felt the far-right leader displayed “the qualities necessary to be president”. Macron was deemed to be more dynamic, slightly more sincere and to have a better programme than Le Pen. Half judged Macron to be more arrogant than his rival, while Le Pen was considered “worrying” by about half. Le Monde concluded that the debate was once again a failure for Le Pen. “Did she give the impression she is ready to govern?” asked Le Parisien in an editorial. “That is the only question that matters. Judging by the debate, she did not dispel the doubts.” Le Figaro said the debate would not have changed voters’ intentions. A poll from Opinonway carried out after the debate suggested Macron could win Sunday’s vote by 56% to 44%, a wider gap than had been projected before the face-off.",News/World news,French election: Macron and Le Pen hit the road in campaign’s final hours,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/21/french-election-macron-and-le-pen-hit-the-road-in-campaigns-final-hours

4/22/2022,"Aside from racial gerrymandering, suppressing votes, underfunding schools, upholding a biased criminal justice system, denying a woman’s right to choose, preventing access to healthcare, undermining democracy, opposing reparations and thwarting every effort for equal rights, perhaps the most preposterous part of conservative mythology is the insidiously racist idea of “bootstraps”. According to this wholly absurd construct, hard work – and hard work, alone – is a magical key that unlocks the promises of the American dream. And, if one accepts this premise, then the converse must also be true. Anyone who doesn’t achieve their dreams is simply not working hard enough. Although “pulling yourself up by your bootstraps” was originally intended to be an obviously sarcastic phrase suggesting an impossible accomplishment, the concept has become a key component of the Republican ideology, especially as it relates to racial inequality. Apparently, the infallible founding fathers and the heralded leaders of the past wasted 250 years constructing laws, traditions, practices and a constitution that provided an economic, political and social advantage to the white majority when all they had to do was put their noses to the grindstone. America’s white majority benefited from human trafficking, free labor, segregation, redlining and the whole of government-sanctioned racism. Yet, to fulfill the promise that America offers, all Black people ever needed is a strong back, a good idea and an unfailing work ethic. For Black Republicans, accepting this sliver of ahistorical fiction is the first step to ascending to a position of power and prominence in the Grand Old Party. Counterbalancing the accusations of racism lobbed at the Republican party is the main job of Black conservatives. To do this, they are required to fabricate a life story that serves as a parable and proof of the bootstrapping thesis. Even before Herschel Walker decided to vie for the Georgia Senate seat occupied by Senator Raphael Warnock, the NFL running-back-turned-bootstrap-evangelist made a habit of explaining how his work ethic and a don’t-quit mentality led to accomplishments as a student, multimillionaire and a business mogul. There was only one problem with Walker’s backstory: It doesn’t seem to be true. According to investigations by the Associated Press, Georgia Public Broadcasting and the Atlanta Constitution-Journal, there is no evidence that supports Walker’s claims to own the largest minority-owned food business in America, his supposed net worth of $65m, or his proprietary mist that can “kill any Covid in your body”. It is possible that Walker isn’t a liar; maybe he simply meant to inspire others with the story about how he worked his way out of poverty to graduate in the top 1% of his class at the University of Georgia … Except he didn’t graduate from college. Although he was hailed as the only hope of regaining the invaluable Senate seat, Walker’s Republican challengers are now convinced that his fabricated backstory, and domestic violence allegations by his ex-wife, have become a risk to the party, according to a report by Politico. Now that Walker’s con has been exposed, he is of no use to his Republican colleagues. The fairytale life that was once his biggest attribute has become “baggage”. The South Carolina senator Tim Scott is taking note. For years, he has repeatedly extolled the values of hard work as part of his origin story. He often recounts the tale of his poor, illiterate grandfather who – Scott conveniently forgets to mention – owned 900 acres in South Carolina. While Scott once told me during an interview that he “struggles to come up with a concise definition of what systemic racism looks like”, he confidently told the world that “America is not a racist country”. And, according to Axios, Scott is now preparing to give a speech that warns against “teaching kids that they are oppressors”. How convenient. I’m sure it has nothing to do with the fact that Scott’s name has been bandied about as a presidential candidate. Perhaps America’s highest-ranking Black Republican is Clarence Thomas. During his rise to the supreme court, Thomas loved to tell the tale of how his sister was content to survive on government assistance while he embraced the all-American ethos of hard work. “She gets mad when the mailman is late with her welfare check,” Thomas told a group of Black conservatives in 1980. “What’s worse is that now her kids feel entitled to the check too. They have no motivation for doing better or getting out of that situation.’’ It turns out, it was all a lie. But of course, it served its purpose. As a supreme court justice, Thomas’s life has turned into a liability that may cost his party a supreme court seat. “What has happened too often is that people who seemingly mean well have promoted things that do not encourage development of any innate talent in people,” explained another Black bootstrapper, Ben Carson. “Hence we have generation after generation living in dependent situations. It’s not that they’re bad people, it’s that this is what they’ve been given, and it’s all they know in some cases.” As secretary of the housing and urban development department, Carson, a former presidential candidate, pledged to reverse policies that “created a culture of dependency in urban communities”. Carson didn’t mention that those same policies provided shelter, food and even the ability to see clearly during his quest to become one of the most celebrated neurosurgeons in American history. But, alas, he has been discarded, too. Unlike their white counterparts, Black Republicans are required to promote the idea that – instead of discrimination, systemic inequality and history – Black people are victims of their own laziness. Kelly Loeffler, who held the Georgia Senate seat before Walker’s opponent, came from a family that profited from government assistance. However, Loeffler didn’t bear the burden of representing the shiftlessness of white “culture”. Ben Carson didn’t point out that the man who appointed him could serve as the poster boy for white privilege, if Trump could manage to wrestle the title from the man who appointed Thomas to the supreme court, George HW Bush. But that’s not what makes this a racist idea. By preaching the tenets of the bootstrap gospel, Black Republicans are essentially saying that 83% of Black voters, 63% of Hispanic voters and 72% of Asian American voters are wrong. The fact that every non-white demographic in America has rejected this narrative cannot unseat this fraudulent conservative conceit. They might not know much about history, business, systemic racism or inequality in their own country but, apparently, white people know what’s best for everyone else. The willingness to toss aside the people who labored for the conservative movement actually disproves the logic of bootstrap mythology. Ultimately, when the premise of the false narrative is exposed as a fantasy, they have no use for the Black people whose lives once supported the idea that the gears to equality are lubricated with elbow grease. It turns out, it was snake oil all along.
