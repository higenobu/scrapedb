1/23/2022,"Eddie Howe has said he does not know whether he will meet Mohammed bin Salman in Jeddah next week but any conversation with Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler is bound to be considerably easier after this. Newcastle’s manager is not taking his players to a warm weather training camp on the Red Sea coast until Sunday but at the final whistle he resembled a man feeling the sun on his back for the first time following a long, hard winter.  Jonjo Shelvey’s second-half free-kick secured Howe’s Saudi-owned side only their second win of the season, lifting Newcastle to the heady heights of 18th place. They still only have 15 points but they are only one short of Norwich, four shy of Everton and only seven behind Leeds; suddenly one of the Premier League’s greatest escapes look feasible. Marcelo Bielsa’s alternately despairing and infuriated body language highlighted the severity of this blow to his Leeds team who, not for the first time, failed to turn dominance into goals before coming undone at a set piece. Gareth Southgate looked on from the stands and, after witnessing some of the early wobbles among Newcastle’s defence, England’s 51-year-old manager might well have fancied his chances of rolling back the years and getting a game at centre-half for Howe’s side. Only a fine, point-blank save on Martin Dubravka’s part kept Dan James’s shot out after a wonderfully fluid attacking move also featuring Rodrigo and Raphinha. Slick and quick, Leeds persistently dissected Newcastle with the ease of a knife slicing through butter. Paul Dummett is an underrated, positionally intelligent, left-back but he joined a long line of counterparts who have struggled to contain Raphinha. On the opposite flank Stuart Dallas impressed enormously as an attacking left back for Bielsa’s side and his dangerous attacking incursions frequently prevented Howe’s right back, Kieran Trippier from acting as a visiting attacking catalyst. The resultant shortage of crosses left Newcastle’s £25m one-time Leeds centre forward Chris Wood largely isolated, with his side’s principal hope of a goal hinging on the sort of odd bright counterattacking moment which concluded with Ilan Meslier doing very well to save Shelvey’s volley. Generally though Meslier was well protected by a 4-1-4-1 system featuring Robin Koch, Bielsa’s German centre-half, doing a decent job serving as a midfield anchor in the enduring, injury induced absence of Kalvin Phillips. Koch’s influence emphasised Howe’s need for a midfield enforcer in addition to at least one new central defender. Bielsa could have done without Patrick Bamford being, once again, sidelined by injury. In the absence of their key striker, Leeds could not make their dominance and dynamism count and had no one to polish off Raphinha’s deliveries. If Howe’s team invariably looked in trouble when Leeds moved the ball wide, Bielsa became agitated every time Allan Saint-Maximin assumed possession for Newcastle. It was not Saint-Maximin’s best game but he still fazed a Leeds team unable to capitalise on Jamaal Lascelles’s central defensive weaknesses. Newcastle’s captain has not been at his best lately and here Lascelles repeatedly forfeited possession, often around the halfway line. Indeed he injured himself attempting to retrieve one such concession of possession and limped off to be replaced by Ciaran Clark. By then Howe had already lost Joelinton and Dummett to injury but, for once, not quite everything was going against him. When Diego Llorente dragged the overlapping Javier Manquillo, on for Dummett, back Leeds conceded a free-kick in a dangerous position just outside the box. Shelvey bent it low and it evaded everyone en route past the previously assured but horribly wrong footed Meslier who could only help the ball on its journey into the back of the net. After that Llorente cleared off the line to deny Ryan Fraser, Saint-Maximin was furious not to have had a penalty after being upended by Koch and Meslier saved smartly to keep Joe Willock’s shot out.",Sport/Football,Shelvey’s free-kick gives Newcastle crucial and timely win at Leeds,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/22/leeds-newcastle-premier-league-match-report
1/23/2022,"Arm-wrestle, tug of war, non-event, a fair share of the spoils: this was precisely where this contest was heading until, deep into added time, Marcus Rashford finished Edinson Cavani’s cross from the left to send himself, Manchester United, and the Old Trafford faithful into ecstasy. Cue Rashford, who has been off-colour, rushing across the Stretford End to knee-slide, joined by his jubilant teammates. Ralf Rangnick can take well deserved credit as both Cavani and Rashford were attacking, late introductions, as the German chased victory.  Before the showstopping climax this had been a match of mediocre fare that did not augur well for either team’s Champions League qualification hopes. Yet for Manchester United, who leapfrog West Ham into fourth – until Sunday, at least – the picture changes following a victory in Rangnick’s 10th game as the interim manager. The first action featured a Mason Greenwood shot that was blocked when he might have passed – a recurring fault of his that can frustrate Rangnick. Fernandes, too, made the wrong decision when hitting a cross-field pass that lacked power: Jarrod Bowen dragged the ball down, surged forward and shot, though not on target, a recurring theme. The next error came when Vladimir Coufal dawdled and was mugged by Fernandes, the right-back having to concede a free-kick. Cristiano Ronaldo hit this into West Ham’s wall and Greenwood – again – took aim and was once more unable to test Alphonse Areola, West Ham’s debutant goalkeeper. Harry Maguire, Manchester United’s sole change in place of the excused Victor Lindelof, whose home had been broken into during the week, was up against Michail Antonio and the centre-forward’s clumsy touch allowed the captain to win their first duel. Declan Rice also emerged a victor when challenging Ronaldo, sitting the No 7 on his backside with a robust challenge, then laying the ball off. In a ping-pong affair, Fernades’s curving delivery from the left had Ronaldo flinging himself toward – and missing – the ball. Next, poor control from Anthony Elanga, again preferred to Rashford in the starting XI, had Rangnick flinching but this hardly surprised as each team took turns to find a way to founder. For West Ham Manuel Lanzini tapped a pass to Pablo Fornals, received the ball back, and hit it straight out. The “closest” Manchester United offered to a goal-threat before the break was a Ronaldo shout for a penalty when going went down under Kurt Zouma’s challenge: Jonathan Moss waved this away and the referee was correct to do so. The half petered out, ending with zero shots on target. Manchester United were in the same position as they had been at Brentford and an initial burst involving Ronaldo, Alex Telles and Elanga was reminiscent of their second-half start there, when the latter scored. Fred then drew a first save from either keeper via a fierce drive that began low and rose and had Areola punching the ball away. Were Manchester United stirring? A Ronaldo backheel towards Greenwood that had West Ham scrambling suggested maybe. The visitors’ response took in Fornals dallying in Manchester United’s area, Bowen firing into the side-netting, and Coufal spraying the ball wildly into touch. Then Bowen drew a foul from Maguire and West Ham had promising position on the right: Aaron Cresswell pinged the free-kick in and Ronaldo headed away. This led to a Manchester United attack and corner and when Telles landed it on Raphael Varane’s head the centre-back’s flicked header was wide but at least caused “oohs” from the Stretford End as did an Elanga swivel-and-volley that, again, missed. This was the young Swede’s last act, Rangnick deciding he should be hooked for Rashford. The latter’s quick feet were involved in two openings but in these he first raced up a blind alley, and then swapped passes with Ronaldo before running out of space down the left. Towards the final whistle, Tomas Soucek nearly scored for West Ham with a glancing header that veered past David De Gea’s right post. Then, the goalkeeper’s reflexes stopped Varane scoring inadvertently past him. By the end Cavani and Martial had joined Rashford and Ronaldo and now came Manchester United’s dramatic finish – and win.",Sport/Football,Manchester United snatch victory over West Ham after Rashford’s late winner,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/22/manchester-united-west-ham-premier-league-match-report
1/23/2022,"Everton have vowed to ban any fan caught throwing objects on to the pitch at Goodison Park after several Aston Villa players were struck by a plastic bottle during their side’s 1-0 win over Duncan Ferguson’s team. Former Everton player Lucas Digne and Villa defender Matty Cash were both struck on the head by what appeared to be a full bottle of Lucozade as they celebrated Emiliano Buendía’s decisive goal in front of the home section of the Bullens Road Stand. A supporter was arrested at Goodison Park. Several objects were thrown at the Villa players in first-half stoppage time and Everton insist everyone responsible for the disgraceful scenes will be banned.  In a statement confirming the arrest, the club said: “Everton security staff and Merseyside police identified the supporter using CCTV footage. Several objects were thrown towards the pitch following Aston Villa’s goal at the end of the first half, with one missile appearing to strike two opposition players. Investigations in conjunction with the police are ongoing, and the club will issue bans to any fans identified throwing objects.” The Aston Villa manager, Steven Gerrard, made light of the incident but said his players’ reaction was key to an impressive away win. “None of the players have mentioned it. We scored at a really important time and so at half-time it was more about resetting the focus. I haven’t seen anything so I don’t want to comment on any incidents that may or may not have happened. The pleasing thing for me is that the players didn’t mention it and just focused on their football.” Ferguson, who was taking charge of his first game in his second spell as Everton’s caretaker manager, condemned the bottle throwing. “I never saw the incident but I have been told about it,” he said. “It is bang out of order. That is not the way to do things. That is totally wrong.” Several hundred Everton fans staged a sit-in protest that lasted for over an hour after the final whistle and called for chairman Bill Kenwright plus other board members to leave a club that is in serious relegation trouble. Defeat left Everton with 19 points from 20 games, the club’s lowest points tally at this stage of a season in 24 years. “For me, fans can protest and say what they want because it is their club,” Ferguson said. “They have the right to support their club in any way they want. I know how sick they are. I am gutted as much as them. I am on the floor, I am sick for the fans.”",Sport/Football,Everton fan arrested as club vow to ban bottle throwers after Aston Villa defeat,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/22/everton-fan-arrested-as-club-vow-to-ban-bottle-throwers-after-aston-villa-defeat
1/23/2022,"The home secretary, Priti Patel, faces calls to overhaul gun licensing laws as campaigners warn a “broken” system is needlessly putting lives at risk. Patel agreed last week to meet Plymouth residents about gun controls after Jake Davison, 22, a licensed gun holder, killed his mother and four passersby, including three-year-old Sophie Martyn, in an attack in the city last August.  Luke Pollard, the Labour MP for Plymouth, Sutton and Devonport, said: “The gun control system is broken and needs reform. What we’ve experienced has been so horrific and so awful that we do need to take steps to work out how this can be prevented from happening in the future.” Britain has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world as a result of restrictions brought in after the killing of 16 people in Hungerford in August 1987 and the murder of 16 children and their teacher at Dunblane primary school in March 1996. Handguns are now banned in Britain for most purposes. There are, however, concerns about the licensing regime overseen by police forces. Both gun control campaigners and shooting groups agree that the system is badly under-resourced. One expert at the British Association for Shooting and Conservation (BASC) warned the regime was “close to collapse” and it was likely some guns were now being held illegally because of delays in licence renewals after the Plymouth shootings. Gun control campaigners want major reforms to avoid further tragedies. Gill Marshall-Andrews, of the Gun Control Network, a non-profit organisation formed after the Dunblane tragedy, said: “The problem with gun licensing is that it is grotesquely underfunded and systems are not properly integrated to flag up potential problems. “The system has clearly failed. We have a very low level of gun homicide in this country, but if there was a better licensing system and the police were more vigorous, then we wouldn’t have had some of these tragedies.” The network wants an increase in the licence fees to cover the full cost of policing the system; a national gun hotline for those wishing to record concerns about a gun; and mandatory notification to partners and former partners of an individual making an application. Police forces are responsible for issuing shotgun certificates, which cost £79.50, and firearms certificates, which cost £88 and are mostly for rifles. On 31 March last year, there were 1,379,399 certificated shotguns and 617,171 certificated firearms and sound moderators, which reduce the noise or flash of a weapon, in England and Wales. Bill Harriman, the BASC’s director of firearms, agreed more resources were urgently required and said the licensing system was “shambolic”. The association is urging chief constables to “get a grip”. He said: “We are concerned that firearms licensing is close to collapse. There is a lack of trained personnel, a lack of resources and a lack of consistency in how the scheme is administered by different police authorities. “The delays for renewing a firearms certificate can be two or three months and if the certificate expires those weapons are held illegally.” He said he was very concerned that some weapons were now being held illegally because of recent delays. A report by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services in 2015 entitled Targeting the Risk warned of the danger of tragedies because of “fundamental gaps” in licensing in England and Wales. It recommended a package of reforms including statutory guidance for police forces and independent scrutiny of decisions. The report’s authors were pessimistic that any of the recommendations would be implemented. They warned: “What is highly likely is that, if change is not effected, there will be another tragedy.” Last August, when Davison went on his rampage, the key recommendation of the report for statutory national guidance of firearms licensing was still not in place. It emerged after the fatal shootings that Davison’s shotgun and certificate had been seized by police in December 2020 after he allegedly assaulted two youths in a park in the city. The weapon and certificate were returned to him the month before the killings after he reportedly attended an anger management course. Police also failed to check his social media accounts, which would have revealed his misogynistic and homophobic views and his presence in online forums for “incels” (men describing themselves as “involuntary celibates”). He compared himself in one YouTube video to the cyborg killer played by Arnold Schwarzenegger in the Terminator films. The firearms licensing department at Devon and Cornwall Police, which was responsible for granting the shotgun certificate to Davison, is under investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct. Three employees have been served disciplinary notices warning them their conduct is being scrutinised. The inquests into the people killed by Davison were formally opened last August. New statutory guidance for licensing came into force last November, but campaigners want to see a thorough review of practices and more wide-reaching reforms. People in Plymouth also want a review of rules which permit pump-action shotguns, the type of weapon Davison owned, to be kept in residential areas. The Home Office said: “Following the tragic incident in Plymouth, the home secretary asked all police forces to urgently review their firearms licensing practices. The returns provided reassurance that the police have in place robust processes for issuing and reviewing firearms and shotgun licences. We have been clear that we will update the statutory guidance for firearms licensing should there be lessons learned from this case. But the UK has some of the toughest firearms laws in the world and while we are not complacent about these high standards, thankfully such incidents are rare. “Firearms licensing is an operational matter for individual police forces. Some applications for firearm certificates are inevitably being affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, but normal procedures are being maintained as far as possible.” The National Police Chiefs Council said: “Policing takes the matter of firearm licensing incredibly seriously. Individual forces are responsible for issuing firearms certificates, and will only do so after their application has been assessed by a dedicated team of experts, a robust process of background checks is completed, and the individual meets criteria set out in the Home Office’s national legislation.”",News/World news,"‘Broken’ gun licensing scheme risks another Plymouth, warn campaigners",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/22/broken-gun-licensing-scheme-risks-another-plymouth-warn-campaigners
1/23/2022,"Aparcel arrives, inside which is a copy of Kay Dick’s dystopian novel of 1977, They: A Sequence of Unease, and a letter informing me that Faber is to reissue it next month. Crikey, but isn’t this amazing? Dick, who died in 2001, is something of a minority interest at this point. She didn’t write much and what she did is either quite peculiar or quite bad, though I’ll always be fond of Ivy and Stevie, a collection of interviews with Ivy Compton-Burnett and Stevie Smith that wears its eccentricity like some crazy hat (“I realised that she had lovely legs because, quite often, she would delve under her skirt for her handkerchief, which she tucked into her knickers,” Dick writes of the former, on whom she first “called” in 1950.)  But if this book’s reappearance is surprising, it’s also ironic. In They, Britain is in the grip of a mercilessly cruel group of philistines: a mob that burns books and paintings, punishing all those who resist. Faber hopes, very laudably, to bring it to a “new generation” of readers and to help it do so, its edition comes with praise from Margaret Atwood and an introduction by Carmen Maria Machado. The wicked thought occurs to me, however, that it’s really publishing itself that most needs this book right now. As Machado notes: “Censorious impulses… and soft bigotry are hardly the exclusive property of the right.” Dick’s novel is reborn in a world in which some imprints (not Faber, I hope) are content to excise completely writers they were delighted to publish only five minutes ago; in which social media seems more and more utterly to terrify editors; and in which, at certain moments, the Society of Authors falls oddly silent. Oh, well. The good news is that this scary little novel can now be theirs – or anyone’s – for just £8.99. Out in the world again, everything is at once the same and subtly different. On the tube, I find myself transfixed by the ads in my carriage, which now speak with one voice of the pandemic. Like a dandelion poking through a crack in a paving stone, capitalism determinedly locates our weaknesses and anxieties, the better that it might brazenly exploit them. Personalised vitamins (“we know you are weary”), a strange concoction for the turbulent gut, mindfulness delivered to your door in a little cardboard box. Be warned: the snake oil merchants are out in force. By the time you read this, I will finally have seen Rebecca Frecknall’s new production of Cabaret, starring Eddie Redmayne and Jessie Buckley, a night out I had to remortgage the house to afford. (Those ticket prices really do evoke the Weimar, I can tell you.) Will I be as high as a kite or suffering from the mother of all anticlimaxes? I don’t know. But either way, at least my pre-show nerves will at last be gone. The emails from the theatre last week were enough to bring on an attack of the vapours, their anhedonic tone somewhat at odds with the fact they purport to be from the Kit Kat Club, as if the place really exists. “Action required!” they command, after which there follows a long list of instructions involving Covid tests and arrival times. We have been told to appear a full 75 minutes before curtain up, which seems completely mad, especially since I couldn’t get two seats next to one another. Will we both be allowed to go to the same bar? Or will one of us end up – I’m reading the small print now – at the place that only serves schnapps?

1/23/2022,"Our ruling class may have been brazenly wheeling suitcases of cheap plonk past the averted gaze of Metropolitan police officers during the last year of lockdowns, but their voters are increasingly finding themselves destitute, hungry, demoralised and priced out of the cheapest bag of apples at the supermarket. It was reported last week that the consumer price index (CPI) measure for inflation rose to 5.4% in December, the highest level for nearly 30 years. The CPI and the retail price index (RPI) are used interchangeably to document the rising price levels of groceries and household goods across the UK. Yet they only tell a fragment of the story of inflation, and grossly underestimate the true cost-of-living crisis.  A collection of 700 pre-specified goods that includes a leg of lamb, bedroom furniture, a television and champagne seems a blunt and darkly comical tool for recording the impact of inflated grocery prices in a country where two and a half million citizens were forced by an array of desperate circumstances to use food banks in the last year. The Smart Price, Basics and Value range products offered as lower-cost alternatives are stealthily being extinguished from the shelves, leaving shoppers with no choice but to “level up” to the supermarkets’ own branded goods – usually in smaller quantities at larger prices. I have been monitoring this for the last decade, through writing recipes on my online blog and documenting the prices of ingredients in forensic detail. In 2012, 10 stock cubes from Sainsbury’s Basics range were 10p. In 2022, those same stock cubes are 39p, but only available in chicken or beef. The cheapest vegetable stock cubes are, inexplicably, £1 for 10. Last year the Smart Price pasta in my local Asda was 29p for 500g. Today, it is unavailable, so the cheapest bag is 70p; a 141% price rise for the same product in more colourful packaging. A few years ago, there were more than 400 products in the Smart Price range; today there are 87, and counting down. The managing director of Iceland, Richard Walker, stated on ITV on Friday that his stores were losing customers “to food banks, and to hunger”. Not to other competitors, not to better offers, but to starvation, and charity. Iceland has pledged to keep its £1 lines at the flat rate of £1 until the end of the year, a commitment to customers at the sharp end that is rare in the cut-throat world of supermarket retail. Last Thursday I was contacted on Twitter by an elderly gentleman who confessed he had eaten a teaspoon of toothpaste for his dinner in order to fool himself into thinking he had chewed, swallowed, tasted and digested something. I relayed this, on Good Morning Britain, to the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, who said he was “appalled” that such things happened in Britain today. Appalled but unsurprised, perhaps, considering the eradication of social support has been Conservative policy for 12 long years. People with very little are often the sharpest of economists and mathematicians, holding dozens of prices in our heads so we can remove objects from the shopping basket at the checkout when the total comes to more than the pittance in our bank account. Juggling late and delayed benefit payments, knocking a bit off each bill to keep the wolves from the door, shopping around for the cheapest school uniform that won’t fall apart in the washing machine, and scrutinising the shelf-edge labels for the “price per 100g” of each product, ignoring the brightly coloured offers. I have been writing about these things for 10 years now. I have given evidence to multiple parliamentary inquiries, led numerous petitions, been consulted on the School Food Plan and the National Food Strategy, spoken twice at the Conservative party conference, and still the realities of the worst of our collective experiences are dismissed by haughty money men as not matching their theoretical lamb-and-champagne metrics. So, along with a team of economists, charitable partners, retail price analysts, people working to combat poverty in the UK, ex-staff from the Office for National Statistics and others who have volunteered their time and expertise, I am compiling a new price index – one that will document the disappearance of the budget lines and the insidiously creeping prices of the most basic versions of essential items at the supermarket. At the very least, it will serve as an irrefutable snapshot of the reality experienced by millions of people. At its best, it may be a warning shot to retailers who keep their £7.50 ready meals and £6 bottles of wine at £7.50 and £6 for a decade, while quadrupling the price of basic stock cubes and broken irregular grains of white rice.

With Florence Given (Somethin’ Else) | somethingelse.comDesperately Seeking Wisdom | desperatelyseekingwisdom.comThe MLK Tapes (iHeartPodcasts/Tenderfoot TV) | apple.comBBC Sounds Audio Lab | BBC Sounds Florence Given, 23, is an illustrator and the bestselling author of Women Don’t Owe You Pretty. Her drawings have a kitsch 1960s Pucci feel; her writing, like her social media, is punchy, feminist, sexual and funny. She has a 600,000-strong Instagram following of, mostly, other young women. So, a huge, ready-made audience and an acknowledged desire to be seen and heard… she’s the perfect new podcast host. You could be snooty about this, bemoan her lack of broadcasting experience, but some people are born for the public eye, and Given is one.  And here is her new podcast, Exactly, in which she promises to discuss “really meaty and broad topics” in “conversations that allow for complexity”. Her topics are: sex, social media, feminism, relationships and body image. Perhaps not as broad as she claims, but this show sits firmly within Given’s world, which is all about promoting other noisy, sexually confident women. Et voilà! Her first interviewee is Erica Storm, who’s a dominatrix and, more interestingly, runs sexual self-empowerment classes. Storm gets her pupils to shout “pussy power” and look at their vulvas in a mirror. None of this is radical, or hasn’t been done before (Vagina Monologues; Our Bodies, Ourselves), but every generation of young women needs guidance to negotiate the slings and arrows of the patriarchy, as well as the shame and fear that can result. Given and Storm together are loud, funny and relentlessly positive; the show is one long “yas kween!”. At one point, Storm informs us that she replied to a work colleague’s question by saying: “I’ll have to ask my pussy and get back to you.” You’d have to be a right curmudgeon not to smile, and Given greets most of Storm’s answers with “Incredible! I love it!” There are tweaks that could improve things: Given’s opening five short questions are pretty lame, while the closing advice-to-listeners section is hit and miss. One answer, about a man not wanting to use condoms, was excellent: “Safe sex is self-care.” Another, for a woman who’d never had an orgasm, could have been more helpful. Still, these are niggles. Exactly is a proper blast, a pie-in-the-face slap of upbeat enthusiasm that will, you hope, help less assertive young women dance through their days into sexually satisfying evenings. Exactly is, despite its “you be you” mantra, a self-improvement show (“do the work!”). Seemingly very different but secretly along the same lines, Desperately Seeking Wisdom is a new podcast from Craig Oliver, who used to be director of communications for David Cameron, when Cameron was PM. Oliver’s old job, plus his other, very impressive stint as a TV news editor, mean that he has a bulging contact book. His first interviewees are George Alagiah, Richard Curtis and Ruth Davidson. All three interviews are definitely worth your time, because all these people are interesting, and of an age and personality where they’re happy to talk. But they’re pulled a little off course (especially Davidson) by Oliver’s desire to make his interviewees delve more deeply into their tough times and tell him how to live “simply”. Welcome, yet again, to midlife crisis man. I don’t want to be mean – I’ve written a book on midlife crises myself – but the MLC of the rich man is always the same: “Oops, I spent the whole of my life working ridiculously hard for corporations, stoking my ego and my pension, and now I find that I don’t know my family and my job doesn’t mean anything, whither me?” Yes, who knew that shilling for the Tories would leave you wondering what to do with your life? Oliver seems like a nice enough guy, and his podcast is good. I just wish it wasn’t called Desperately Seeking Wisdom, when the wisdom he seeks has been staring most people in the face for years. (As an aside, he could try reading some Jung or Tolstoy’s The Death of Ivan Ilyich or anything by Oliver Burkeman, whose series The Death of Nuance series was repeated last week on Radio 4 and was as excellent as the first time round.) Or he could take his mind off his own self – often a good idea – by listening to The MLK Tapes. This podcast started just under a fortnight ago and went straight to the top of the iTunes charts. Martin Luther King Day was on 17 January this year, and it’s more than 50 years since King was shot in Memphis by felon-on-the-run James Earl Ray. Writer and podcaster Bill Klaber has been given taped interviews with various people who were nearby when the assassination occurred. The link is another Bill – Bill Pepper – himself a close acquaintance of the civil rights leader. Pepper came into King’s orbit after Pepper wrote about Vietnam war atrocities. Their friendship led to King making an anti-Vietnam war speech in 1967, and Pepper makes a good case for this being a tipping point for the US federal authorities wanting King to disappear. The first episode drops several interesting truth bombs, including how King’s usual all-black security team was suddenly reassigned before Memphis, and that his room at the Lorraine Motel was changed for one with an outside balcony. It’s fascinating, incendiary, convincing stuff – it reminds me a little of James Ellroy’s books – and another feeder for anyone who likes to lip-smack over American conspiracies. Finally, a small hoorah for the BBC’s Audio Lab, an initiative that invited new podcast-makers to submit their ideas to be made as BBC Sounds podcasts.

1/23/2022,"Alex de Minaur had not even finished winning his third-round match when the contrasts with Nick Kyrgios were drawn. By the time a photo of his adorable golden retriever, Enzo, was being beamed around Rod Laver Arena during his post-match interview, the dichotomy had written itself. Here was Australia’s quiet achiever, a man of pure intent and earnest endeavour. Kyrgios, that brash entertainer who craves the headlines, had cast a high-profile shadow out of which other locals could only hope to step.  Cue the emergence of De Minaur, the last Australian man standing at Melbourne Park – a man for his country rather than for himself. He is the quintessential Davis Cup player, Australia’s 109th representative; we know this because he has the number tattooed on his chest. He is the quiet to Kyrgios’s loud. The humility to his ego. The cute, well-looked-after puppy to his callously smashed racket. But to define De Minaur using such one-dimensional tropes does him – and Kyrgios, who is not the devil incarnate – a disservice as a tennis player. De Minaur’s game has been sharp and implausibly quick since his breakout as a teenager about five years ago. And though he has not always produced his best at grand slams – his best run was the quarter-finals at the 2020 US Open – he may yet do so at this one. Saturday’s straight-sets defeat of the Spaniard Pablo Andújar was a performance befitting a 22-year-old who, only three weeks ago, also beat the world No 7, Matteo Berrettini, at the ATP Cup. In August last year he was ranked 17th. Since then he has picked and chosen events and duly dropped down to 42, and was handed the 32nd and last seed in Melbourne by virtue of Casper Ruud’s pre-tournament exit through injury. But now he is in the fourth round and, based on his current form, he could well progress deeper into the second week, with the fourth seed, Stefanos Tsitsipas, potentially waiting in the quarter-finals and the second seed, Daniil Medvedev, in the semis. De Minaur impressed when he won his second-round match two days ago in a couple of short hours before the evening’s headline act of Kyrgios v Medvedev, and looked strong again throughout this 6-4, 6-4, 6-2 victory. It was a composed, assured performance, played out during the primetime evening session in front of Rod Laver himself. De Minaur barely blinked each time he broke Andújar, attacking his serve and backing him into a corner until there was simply no escape. He squeezed into positions one should not squeeze into and found gaps that should not be found against a serve-volleyer who does not offer many openings. Even Andújar – a hitting partner of De Minaur in Spain, where the Australian spends half of his time – applauded an elegant lob which came from beyond the baseline, sailed over his head and kissed the outside his own baseline. “I’m happy with where my level is at, so I’m just taking care of business,” De Minaur said. “I’m very happy I was able to do that in the first week of the slam. “We’re not done, but what I’m most proud of myself was maybe I didn’t play my best level throughout the three matches, but I was solid and I got the win and I didn’t spend eight hours on court. “I went out there, did what I needed to do, great attitude, positive vibes, and got the job done. So that’s also a confidence-booster for sure.” In the last 16 he will play the 20-year-old Italian Jannik Sinner, the 11th seed with a potent backhand and fearless approach. “I hit with Jannik in Sydney,” he said. “I’ve hit with him a lot. I’ve played him. I know what’s coming: immense firepower. I’m going to have to be ready to not get bullied around the court and really take it to him.” When he does, he will not do so as the antidote to Kyrgios, but merely a different type of player with a different personality who can be enjoyed on his own merits.",Sport/Sport,Alex de Minaur sinks Pablo Andújar to reach Australian Open fourth round,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/22/alex-de-minaur-sinks-pablo-andujar-to-reach-australian-open-fourth-round
