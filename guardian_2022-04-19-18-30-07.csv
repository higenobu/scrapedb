4/19/2022,"A cabinet minister has defended Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak over their Partygate penalties, equating them to fines issued to speeding motorists, as the prime minister prepares to argue he did not mislead parliament. When asked if lawmakers could be lawbreakers, the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, told Sky News: “I think we do see consistently, whether it is through parking fines or speeding fines, ministers of both parties over the years have been in that position. “We’ve had prime ministers in the past who have received penalty notices, from what I can see, and also frontbench ministers. “I saw there was a parking notice that Tony Blair had once. We’ve seen frontbench Labour ministers [be fined] and, let’s be frank, government ministers as well.” He added: “You’ve asked me, can someone who sets the laws and the rules, can they also be someone who breaks the rules? That clearly has happened with a number of ministers over the years.” Later on Radio 4, Lewis clarified that he was not trying to equate a speeding ticket with the “sacrifices people made through Covid” but added: “A minister or a parliamentarian getting a fixed-penalty notice, accepting that, acknowledging that, and apologising for that, is the right way to handle it.” Facing claims that the prime minister deliberately misled MPs over his knowledge of a Downing Street party, Lewis said Johnson’s apology did not mean that what he had earlier told parliament was not correct. On Sky News earlier, asked when Johnson came to the view he’d broken the law, Lewis said it was “when the police had issued a fine”. Johnson is expected to use this defence as he faces MPs for the first time since he received a fixed-penalty notice for breaking his own Covid laws by attending a No 10 lockdown party for his birthday. He is expected to make a “full-throated apology” in the Commons on Tuesday, according to PA News agency. However, Johnson, thought to be the first sitting prime minister to be criminally sanctioned, is expected to stop short of addressing the Partygate allegations. He will call for a renewed focus on the Ukraine crisis, and the government’s controversial policy to send asylum seekers to Rwanda. Lewis talked down any prospect of a leadership challenge against Johnson, saying the prime minister was focused on “how we move our country forward” and getting the “big calls right” – pointing to Brexit, Covid, the war in Ukraine and the cost of living crisis. While Johnson hopes to ride out the current storm, the full Whitehall report into Partygate by Sue Gray is yet to be published, and police are still investigating up to six further gatherings where Johnson is said to have been present. In the Commons, opposition MPs will question why the prime minister insisted repeatedly that no rules had been broken. Emily Thornberry, the shadow attorney general, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We’re not going to get the result we should get unless the prime minister looks into his own conscience and decides he should do the right thing.” She added: “We’re not going to get that because the PM doesn’t tell the truth.” While Thornberry said Johnson would get “a good reception” for his actions on the Ukraine crisis, she said he was expected not only to give “another weak apology” but accept he lied to parliament and explain how he “squares that” with his own ministerial code. Opposition parties are pushing for the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, to allow a vote on a debate about whether the prime minister should be held in contempt of parliament, potentially launching an investigation into whether the Commons was misled. Anything that requires a vote, however, is likely to fail given the Conservatives’ large majority. On Saturday, Conservative MPs across the country said they believed traditional supporters were abandoning them after the prime minister’s penalty. Former immigration minister Caroline Nokes wrote in the Observer that she was sticking with her decision to submit a letter of no confidence in Johnson.",News/Politics,"Partygate penalties ‘like parking fines’, says cabinet minister",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/19/partygate-penalties-like-parking-fines-says-cabinet-minister
4/19/2022,"Welcome to The Breakdown, the Guardian’s weekly (and free) rugby union newsletter. Here’s an extract from this week’s edition. To receive the full version every Tuesday, just pop your email in below. Playing top-level sport, in the end, is less about talent than the ability to bounce back from failure. “I’ve failed over and over again in my life and that’s why I succeed,” said the great Michael Jordan, who knew a little about turning talent into consistent achievement. There is not a single great athlete who, at one stage or another, has not experienced a jolt of gut-twisting dismay. Sometimes, as happened to Marcus Smith on Easter Saturday, the worst of moments can collide with the most uplifting. Which is where this piece simply has to start. There have been hundreds of tries scored in this long northern hemisphere season but none liable to stick longer in the memory of everyone present at the Twickenham Stoop at the weekend for the Harlequins v Montpellier fixture. It was just before the half hour and the game had already been lively. Quins had made a fast start but Montpellier were still ahead in the tie and, as their director of rugby Philippe Saint-André memorably observed afterwards, had not just come over to London “to take the sun and drink beer”. At which point Danny Care, ever the optimist, leapt acrobatically to keep a restart in play inside his 22 and shovelled the ball backwards in the direction of his half-back partner Smith. The rest was a glorious blur, as if someone had pressed the fast forward button. Having scooped the ball deftly off the deck, Smith took off like a scalded Easter bunny, throwing a cheeky dummy to André Esterhuizen before goose-stepping and accelerating past five Montpellier defenders. He had almost made it to the 10-metre line when he found the speedy Cadan Murley who expertly drew the final defender to put Joe Marchant over. It will be mighty hard to beat as the European try of the season. Which was why no one at the Stoop saw the unexpected final twist coming. Smith, having had another scampering try disallowed, appeared to have clinched victory for Quins when another beautiful little delayed pass put the ever-improving Louis Lynagh over for his second try of the game. All that was needed, with Quins now just one point behind, was the angled conversion from close to the 15-metre line. Smith had slotted his previous four conversions without missing a beat and, normally, it would have been a routine kick. Except that this time it wasn’t. Smith tugged it a fraction and the ball sailed the wrong side of the left upright. It was so close that many Quins fans assumed it had gone over. Even the assistant referees behind the posts looked at each other as if slightly baffled. From the stands it looked as if Smith had not even conceived of the possibility of it missing either. So what knee-jerk conclusions should we all draw? That Smith is a flawed genius? That he choked at the crucial moment? That it just goes to show that the 23-year-old is not yet quite the finished article? Perhaps all those things are true but how many people were thinking or saying that an hour earlier? It just depends upon which of the two Saturday snapshots you perceive as the most telling. A more reasoned response, perhaps, is to remind ourselves that sport is played by human beings. The best snooker players miss the occasional black, even Wimbledon finalists find the net on match point. Does that render all the other shots they play irrelevant? Of course not. It just underlines that talent on its own is not always enough. It feels as if we are entering Rory McIlroy territory here. How good was he during the final round at Augusta? How many dull lives does his fabulous swing enrich? Sure, but how come he has never won a Green Jacket? At which point people tend to forget the fact he has finished in the top 10 in seven of his 14 trips to the Masters and is still only 32. Once again there is a choice of narrative, as there is with so many top sportspeople. Which merely underlines the universal truth: the more you achieve the greater the expectation to keep doing it. Quins’ senior coach Tabai Matson also made an interesting point after the game when he pointed out that the margin of error involved is so tiny that playmakers and goalkickers should be treated more sympathetically. “The guys who touch the ball the most get a bit of leeway,” he stressed. Which is worth bearing in mind whenever we discuss mercurial fly-halves, in particular. If Finn Russell, as he did again for Racing at the weekend, creates a try with a beautiful pass over the top, the number of people basking in its gorgeousness tend to be fewer in number than those asking why his Six Nations form for Scotland tailed off. Danny Cipriani, Owen Farrell, George Ford and even Beauden Barrett have also had to battle similarly split opinions, as has every Welsh fly-half since Barry John. But what, ultimately, is better? A mechanical robot who barely makes a mistake but creates very little? Or a magician who makes the occasional howler? The answer is an athlete who learns from his or her mistakes and, as per Jordan, emerges the stronger for the experience. Saturday’s aberration will sting but, perversely, it could just be the making of Smith’s career. What we already know for certain is that the game is fortunate to have him.",Sport/Sport,The Breakdown | Marcus Smith’s gut-twisting dismay could yet be making of his career,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/19/marcus-smith-gut-twisting-dismay-could-yet-be-making-of-his-career-the-breakdown
4/19/2022,"When Starbucks opened it flagship reserve roastery in the Meatpacking District of Manhattan in late 2018, the “sleek, inspiring, coffee extravaganza” was supposed to show the world a new, more sophisticated side of the coffee chain. A 10ft, 2,000lb copper sculpture of the Starbucks siren logo presides over the space, which includes a coffee roasting manufacturing plant, a terrarium based on Starbucks’ coffee farm in Costa Rica, a mixology bar that offers cocktails, an on-site bakery, a coffee roastery scoop bar, and full dine-in service. Now the site is also emblematic of another big trend at Starbucks – unionization. The roastery is the site of the first unionized Starbucks location in New York City, and the first Starbucks reserve roastery to unionize, after workers voted in favor of a union on 1 April, with 46 votes in favor and 36 against. Sam LaGow, who has worked at Starbucks for about six years and at the reserve roastery in Manhattan since 2019, said the union organizing effort developed from conversations between workers in the wake of the first Starbucks’ union victory in Buffalo in December. “There was plenty of impetus for it, both in terms of frustrations about working conditions and thoughts about why we like the idea of a democratized workplace,” said LaGow. He said workers at the reserve roastery face constant problems with staffing and day-to-day operations that accommodate customers far more than Starbucks employees, adding that working conditions worsened throughout the pandemic. “Since Covid, we’ve seen an almost exponential increase in our responsibilities at the roastery, and with this has come no commensurate compensation for it,” said LaGow. “Life in New York and the world at large has grown more expensive in the last year or two. Tt has everyone wondering what they the hell they’re still doing here if it’s going to get more demanding, being asked to do more for customers and management, and really only seeing often decent, but sometimes inadequate annual pay increases.” LaGow also said even some of Starbucks’ benefits, such as healthcare, are too expensive and inaccessible for workers to afford. Now that LaGow and his co-workers have won their union election, they face the daunting task of negotiating their first union agreement with the company. Organizers are circulating a bargaining survey to establish the priorities and issues workers would like to focus on in in negotiating a first collective bargaining agreement with Starbucks. “We understand just what a monumental task we have before us. But we’ve sort of come this far, and I don’t feel any less encouraged to do what I’m doing,” said LaGow. “When you put so much of your life and energy into a company, you expect something commensurate to come out of that, and not for many years has that been the case in any part of the service sector in America. That is what we’re looking to change.” Since the first union election victory in the US at a Starbucks corporate store location in Buffalo in December, workers at more than 200 Starbucks chains around the US have filed for union election petitions with the National Labor Relations Board, and 18 stores have officially won their union elections, as of 13 April. As the wave of Starbucks workers continues to expand their union organizing efforts, Starbucks senior management has remained steadfast in their aggressive opposition to unions. Starbucks’ chief executive, the billionaire Howard Schultz, who recently returned to the helm of the company, claimed the company is being “assaulted” by the threat of unionization. “Going forward, it will be important for all of you to recognize that outside labor unions are attempting to sell a very different view of what Starbucks should be,” said Schultz in a letter dated 10 April. Workers have filed dozens of unfair labor practice charges against Starbucks since the union organizing campaign took off in Buffalo, and workers in New York, Tennessee, North Carolina, Kansas and Arizona have alleged they were fired in retaliation for union organizing. Workers at stores in Washington, New York, Kansas, North Carolina, Arizona, Tennessee and Pennsylvania, have gone on strike over working conditions or held protest rallies in support of fired workers. A spokesperson for Starbucks said all allegations of retaliation are “categorically false”. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has issued two complaints against Starbucks for retaliation against workers in Arizona, and prosecutors with the board plan to declare the firing of seven workers in Memphis illegal unless the company settles the case. Miguel Perez Glassner, a Starbucks employee at the reserve roastery since October, said he had always been supportive of labor unions, but the idea began to take hold after the first Starbucks union win in Buffalo, when workers at the reserve roastery in New York City were working during a surge of Omicron cases. Several of his co-workers became ill during that surge, and Perez Glassner said it was stressful waiting for management to react and make decisions. They initially planned to switch to a to-go model, but at the last minute opted to shut down the store for three days. “There was this horrible suspense of waiting for them to decide our fate,” said Perez Glassner. “That was the moment where I realized there needs to be some kind of better system that can address our concerns for our health and our ability to staff well.” In mid-February, workers went public with their union organizing campaign at the reserve roastery in filing for a union election petition. At that point, management began pushing for workers to vote no. The company tried to use the manufacturing workers at the roastery – who pulled their union election petition before the election was held – to try to entice other workers to reject the union, claiming the union had abandoned those workers, though the workers themselves had made that decision. “Our management on the retail side of the roastery put up this letter about how Starbucks Workers United has abandoned the roasting team,” said Perez Glassner. “It’s funny to me how management had been demanding that we be respectful, but it didn’t seem very respectful in misrepresenting what was going on there. It was very misleading.” A spokesperson for Starbucks said stores throughout the company have adjusted hours and levels of operations through Covid-19 surges, including Omicron surges this winter. “We took a great deal of pride in not only communicating clearly with our partners, for making those adjustments based off the staffing levels,” they said.",News/Business,Union drive at Manhattan roastery shows spirit of Starbucks workers,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/19/starbucks-manhattan-union-drive-reserve-roastery
4/19/2022,"Basketball has distinctly North American origins: it was invented by Canadian Dr James Naismith while he was teaching at a Massachusetts YMCA. However, since the first basketball game was played back in 1892, the sport has grown into an international concern. Last week, the NBA celebrated its 75th anniversary by naming its All-Time European Teams, voted on by fans and European basketball experts. The first team was filled with familiar names. Along with two current superstars in Greece’s Giannis Antetokounmpo, of the Milwaukee Bucks, and Slovenia’s Luka Dončić, of the Dallas Mavericks, the roster was completed with three retired players who had a huge impact on the NBA: Spain’s Pau Gasol, Germany’s Dirk Nowitzki and France’s Tony Parker. The second team included only one current player, Serbia’s Nikola Jokić, who just so happens to be the reigning MVP. Alongside Jokić were four players who never quite became household names but helped establish the viability of European players in the NBA: Toni Kukoč and the late Drazen Petrović, both from Croatia, Lithuania’s Arvydas Sabonis and Serbia’s Peja Stojaković. All of those four except Stojaković have already been enshrined in the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame. Determining which of these players was truly the best is an impossibly subjective task, especially when many of them split their careers between the NBA and international leagues. A few years ago, however, this writer argued that – judged solely on his exploits in the NBA – Nowitzki had the most important career of any European basketball player. He is sixth on the all-time scoring list, just above Wilt Chamberlain and right below Michael Jordan. The German was a 14-time All-Star and has both an NBA MVP and a finals MVP to his credit. Tony Parker won four championships with the San Antonio Spurs, but as important as the Frenchman was in that dynasty, Tim Duncan was the star of those teams. Pau Gasol helped the Los Angeles Lakers win back-to-back championships but as Kobe Bryant’s sidekick. Meanwhile, when the Dallas Mavericks shocked the world by defeating LeBron James’s Miami Heat in the 2011 finals, they did it on the back of Nowitzki, who spent his entire 21-year career with the franchise (also a league record). Currently, Nowitzki towers over his competition as having the best NBA career of any European player. Yet, there’s that word “currently.” Nowitzki was 40 when he stepped away from the game: his accomplishments were as much a product of his longevity as his undeniable gifts. There is plenty of time for the younger European superstars to eventually overtake him. Let’s look first at Antetokounmpo. The Greek Freak is only 27 and already has two NBA MVPs under his belt, alongside six All-Star nods and the league title he won last year with the Bucks in a finals in which he excelled. Considering that he’s only getting better, it feels that – barring injuries – the two-way threat will continue to accumulate awards throughout his career. Antetokounmpo, in fact, is once again an MVP candidate this year, where he joins two fellow players who happen to hail from outside the US. The other two frontrunners are Philadelphia 76ers big man Joel Embiid, who was born in Cameroon, and Jokić, who is the same age as Antetokounmpo. While 2019 Rookie of the Year Dončić, Nowitzki’s successor in Dallas, isn’t a serious contender for this year’s MVP award, it’s still remarkable where he is in his career in relation to his age. He was named to the NBA’s All-Time European first team, despite being just 23 years old. Nowitzki himself has admitted that he has begun signing his former Mavericks teammate’s jerseys. Germans friends that come visit always buy jerseys. I say: hold on let me get a sharpie and they say: oh no. That’s ok. This is actually Luka’s. Do you mind getting it signed… 🙄 With the right amount of health and luck, maybe the two most important factors in any athlete’s career, any (or all) of these three players could surpass Nowitzki. Beyond that, there will be more great players to emerge from Europe who will be in the position to best those that came before. There is nothing static in sports: records are broken, accomplishments are eclipsed and even the longest-reigning king will eventually face challengers to his throne. What will never change will be those who came first: the ones that proved that European players could not just compete but establish themselves as pivotal figures in what has become a truly global sport.",Sport/Sport,Dirk Nowitzki’s reign as Europe’s NBA all-time great may be short lived,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/19/nba-all-time-european-team-basketball-dirk-nowitzki-giannis-antetokounmpo-luka-doncic
4/19/2022,"Alarge temperature differential developing across North America later this week, brought about by significant large-scale mid-level troughing, is expected to bring widespread unsettled – and potentially extreme – weather conditions. Spanning a distance of about 500 miles across the northern Great Plains and Mississippi basin, temperatures could range from more than 10C above average in the east, to more than 10C below average in the west. At this stage it is uncertain as to where the significant temperature boundary will lie, but a single state could see maximum daytime temperatures range from 25C in the east to barely scraping 0C farther west. Through Friday and this weekend, an area of low pressure will deepen rapidly, tracking north-eastwards. The notable thermal differential will encourage the development of widespread strong winds with gusts that could reach 50-70mph across central parts of the US. In addition, the associated cold front may allow for the development of severe thunderstorms, the risk gradually pushing farther north and east through the weekend as the pressure-centre shifts. These thunderstorms could be accompanied by torrential rain, large hail and tornadic activity. The Northern Plains are also likely to get significant snow accumulations where the frigid air remains. At this range, the development of the system going into next week is still uncertain, especially at local levels. On the other side of the Pacific, large temperature contrasts will also be at play this week and early next. Significant warmth across parts of north-east China, Korea and Japan will continue for the remainder of this week. Temperatures of up to 10C above the April average look likely, with areas such as central Japan, more used to maximum temperatures of 15-18C in mid-April, possibly experiencing temperatures rising into the high 20s instead. However, forecast models are indicating that the warmth is unlikely to last, with a strong cold front surging eastwards early next week, bringing with it heavy rain and strong winds. Behind this, a significant drop in temperature looks likely. Some places, particularly across north-east China, may experience a return of night-frost in places where daytime temperatures were around 30C just a couple of days earlier.",News/News,Bumpy ride in store for central US as large cold trough forms,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/apr/19/bumpy-ride-in-store-for-central-us-as-large-cold-trough-forms
