2/21/2022,"Last September, Donald Trump released a statement through his Save America website. “It is my great honor to endorse a true warrior,” he proclaimed, “a patriot who has fought for our country, who was willing to say what few others had the courage to say, who has my Complete and Total Endorsement.” Former US presidents usually reserve their most gushing praise – replete with Capital Letters – for global allies or people they are promoting for high office. A candidate for the US Senate, perhaps, or someone vying to become governor of one of the biggest states.  Trump by contrast was heaping plaudits on an individual running for an elected post that a year ago most people had never heard of, let alone cared about. He was endorsing Mark Finchem, a Republican lawmaker from Tucson, in his bid to become Arizona’s secretary of state. Until Trump’s endorsement, Finchem, like the relatively obscure position for which he is now standing, was scarcely known outside politically informed Arizona circles. Today he is a celebrity on the “Save America” circuit, one of a coterie of local politicians who have been thrown into the national spotlight by Trump as he lays the foundations for a possible ground attack on democracy in the 2024 presidential election. The role of secretary of state is critical to the smooth workings and integrity of elections in many states, Arizona included. The post holder is the chief election officer, with powers to certify election results, vet the legal status of candidates and approve infrastructure such as voting machines. In short, they are in charge of conducting and counting the vote. About three weeks after Trump lost the 2020 presidential election – and on the same day that Joe Biden’s 10,457-vote victory in Arizona was certified – Finchem hosted Rudy Giuliani at a downtown Phoenix hotel. Giuliani, then Trump’s personal lawyer, announced a new theory for why the result should be overturned: that Biden had relied on fraudulent votes from among the 5 million undocumented immigrants living in the state – a striking number given that Arizona only has a total of 7 million residents. Two weeks after that, Finchem was among 30 Republican lawmakers in Arizona who signed a joint resolution. It called on Congress to block the state’s 11 electoral college votes for Biden and instead accept “the alternate 11 electoral votes for Donald J Trump”. Finchem was present in Washington on 6 January 2021, the day that hundreds of angry Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol, resulting in the deaths of five people with 140 police officers injured. He had come to speak at a planned “Stop the Steal” rally, later cancelled, to spread the “big lie” that the election had been rigged. Communications between Finchem and the organizers of the “Stop the Steal” rally earned the lawmaker a knock on the door from the January 6 committee this week. The powerful congressional investigation into the insurrection issued a subpoena for him to appear before the panel and to hand over documents relating to the effort to subvert democracy. Finchem will have to answer to the committee for what he did in the wake of the 2020 election, or face legal consequences. But there’s a more disconcerting question thrown up by his candidacy for secretary of state: were he to win the position, would he be willing and able to overturn the result of the 2024 presidential election in Arizona, potentially paving the way for a political coup? “Someone who wants to dismantle, disrupt and completely destroy democracy is running to be our state’s top election officer,” said Reginald Bolding, the Democratic minority leader in the Arizona House who is running against Finchem in the secretary of state race. “That should terrify not just Arizona, but the entire nation.” Trump has so far endorsed three secretary of state candidates in this year’s election cycle, and Finchem is arguably the most controversial of the bunch. (The other two are Jody Hice in Georgia and Kristina Karamo in Michigan.) Originally from Kalamazoo in Michigan, he spent 21 years as a public safety officer before retiring to Tucson and setting up his own small business. In 2014 he was elected to the Arizona legislature, representing Oro Valley. Even before Finchem was inaugurated as a lawmaker, he was stirring up controversy. On the campaign trail in 2014, he announced that he was “an Oath Keeper committed to the exercise of limited, constitutional governance”. The Oath Keepers are a militia group with a list of 25,000 current or past members, many from military or law enforcement backgrounds. They have been heavily implicated in the January 6 insurrection. The founder of the Oath Keepers, Stewart Rhodes, and nine co-defendants are facing trial for seditious conspiracy based on allegations that they meticulously planned an armed attack on the heart of American democracy. Finchem entered the Arizona legislature in January 2015 and soon was carving out a colourful reputation. With his bushy moustache, cowboy hat and boots, and offbeat political views, his hometown news outlet Tucson Weekly dubbed him “one of the nuttier lawmakers” in the state. Bolding, who entered the legislature at the same time as Finchem, remembers being called into his office soon after they both started. “He wanted to show me a map of how Isis and other terrorist groups were pouring over the border with Mexico to invade the United States,” Bolding told the Guardian. One of the first measures sponsored by Finchem reduced state taxes on gold coins on the basis that they were “legal tender”. He then introduced legislation that would have imposed a “code of ethics” on teachers – a “gag law” as some decried it – that would have restricted learning in class. The nine-point code was later revealed to have been cut and pasted from a campaign calling itself “Stop K-12 Indoctrination” backed by the far-right Muslim-bashing David Horowitz Freedom Center. “In essence he wanted a pledge of fealty from teachers that they wouldn’t discuss ‘anti-American’ subjects,” said Jake Dean, who has reported on Finchem for the Tucson Weekly. It was not until Trump began to fire up his supporters with his big lie about the 2020 election that Finchem truly found his political voice. The state lawmaker was a key advocate of the self-proclaimed “audit” of votes in Maricopa county carried out by Cyber Ninjas, the Florida-based company that spent six months scavenging for proof of election fraud and failed to produce any. To this day no credible evidence of major fraud in the 2020 election has been presented, yet Finchem continues to beat that drum. Last month he told a Trump rally in Florence, Arizona: “We know it, and they know it. Donald Trump won.” In his latest ruse, Finchem this month introduced a new bill, HCR2033, which seeks to decertify the 2020 election results in Arizona’s three largest counties. There is no legal mechanism for decertifying election results after the event. As the August primary election to choose the Republican and Democratic candidates for secretary of state draws closer, attention is likely to fall increasingly on Finchem’s appearance in Washington on the day of the insurrection. Allegations that he played a role in inciting the Capitol attacks led to an unsuccessful attempt to have him recalled from the legislature, as well as a motion by Arizona Democrats to have him expelled from the chamber. “The consensus in our caucus was that individuals who participated in the January 6 insurrection do not belong serving as members of the legislature,” Bolding said. Finchem has responded to claims that he helped organize the insurrection by threatening to sue. Through lawyers he has denied that he played any role in the violent assault on the Capitol building, saying that he “never directly witnessed the Capitol breach, and that he was in fact warned away from the Capitol when the breach began”. In his telling of events, he was in Washington that day to deliver to Mike Pence an “evidence book” of purported fraud in the Arizona election and to ask the then vice-president to delay certification of Biden’s victory. For Finchem, January 6 remains a “patriotic event” dedicated to the exercise of free speech; if there were any criminality it was all the responsibility of anti-fascist and Black Lives Matter activists. The Guardian reached out to Finchem to invite him to explain his presence and actions in Washington on January 6, but he did not respond. He has repeatedly insisted that he never came within 500 yards of the Capitol building. But photos and video footage captured by Getty Images and examined by the Arizona Mirror show him walking through the crowd of Trump supporters in front of the east steps of the Capitol after the insurrection was already under way. At 3.14pm on January 6, more than two hours after the outer police barrier protecting the Capitol was overcome by insurrectionists, Finchem posted a photograph on Twitter that he has since taken down. It is not known who took the photo, but it shows rioters close to the east steps of the building above the words: “What happens when the People feel they have been ignored, and Congress refuses to acknowledge rampant fraud. #stopthesteal.” Finchem’s campaign to become the next secretary of state of Arizona is going well. Last year his campaign raised $660,000, Politico reported – more than three times Bolding’s haul. Bolding sees that as indicative of a fundamental problem. On the right, individuals and groups have spotted an opportunity in the secretary of state positions and are avidly targeting them; on the left there is little sign of equivalent energy or awareness. “The public in general may not understand what’s at stake here. All Democrats, all Americans, should be concerned about this and what it could do to the 2024 presidential election,” he said. Dean agrees that there is a perilous void in public knowledge. “What’s so insidious about the Trump plan is that it is focusing on state-level races where voters know very little about what the secretary of state does. That’s a danger, as it gives Finchem a realistic path in which he could win – and Finchem will do what Trump wants.”",News/US news,‘This should terrify the nation’: the Trump ally seeking to run Arizona’s elections,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/21/mark-finchem-trump-arizona-elections-secretary-of-state
2/21/2022,"Days before a new legislative map for North Dakota was set to be introduced in the state house, leaders of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa and Spirit Lake Nation sent a letter to the governor and other state lawmakers urging them to rethink the proposal. “All citizens deserve to have their voices heard and to be treated fairly and equally under the law,” they wrote, arguing that the proposed map was illegal, diluting the strength of their communities’ voice.  But instead, in early November, the Republican-controlled legislature approved the map, with only minor changes. And the Republican governor, Doug Burgum, quickly signed it. “Our voice is going to be muffled once again,” the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa chairman, Jamie Azure, told the Guardian. “It’s getting a little sickening, tell you the truth.” The tribes have sued the state, alleging that the map, which was meant to account for population changes identified in the 2020 census, doesn’t comply with section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The lawsuit, filed earlier this month, claims the map packs some Native voters into one House subdistrict, while putting other “nearby Native American voters into two other districts dominated by white voters who bloc vote against Native Americans’ preferred candidates”. It adds that complying with the Voting Rights Act would mean placing the two tribes in a single district, where they would “comprise an effective, geographically compact majority”. Azure said: “We never want to enter into lawsuits; we never want to do these things. But, you know, at a certain point, the goodwill just goes out the window. And, you know, we’re tired of being disrespected. And that’s how we feel with this lawsuit.” North Dakota’s secretary of state, Al Jaeger, the top election official for the state, told the Guardian in an email that they do not comment on ongoing legal cases. Indigenous people in the US have faced generations of voting restrictions. Although Indigenous people were granted citizenship in 1924, it took more than three decades before they were considered eligible to vote in every state. Since then, they have continued to face a host of roadblocks in the form of scarce polling locations, lack of access to the internet and language barriers. The National Congress of American Indians reported that they have the lowest voter turnout in the country, with 34% of Indigenous people not registered to vote. In North Dakota, the state only recently reached a settlement with two tribes over a law requiring voters to have a valid identification card with a home address (many homes on reservations don’t have a street address). The state ultimately agreed to allow Indigenous people to vote without a residential address. In this new case, the legislative map divides District 9, which includes Turtle Mountain, whose members tend to favor candidates on the political left, into two subdistricts. Since they have a majority in one subdistrict, but not the other, the result is the tribe has one less House seat in which to elect their candidate of choice, explained Michael Carter, staff attorney at the Native American Rights Fund, one of the groups representing the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. It also moved the Spirit Lake Reservation to District 15, grouping it with counties farther north. Spirit Lake tribal members are also known for favoring progressive candidates, while this area tends to be more conservative, Carter explained. The result, he said, would be a Native candidate of choice winning about 5% of the time. “This is just another one of those loopholes that they’re throwing around at us. But we have remedies for it. The remedy that is proposed would work for us and the state,” said the Spirit Lake Tribal chairman, Douglas Yankton, Sr, referring to the proposal to put both tribes into a single district. Jean Schroedel, political science professor at Claremont Graduate University and author of Voting in Indian Country: The View from the Trenches, described the redistricting as a “violation in what has previously been the interpretations of section 2 of the Voting Rights Act”. But, she added, “the court seems to be moving very much away from that.” She cited the recent supreme court decision stating Alabama did not have to redraw its congressional map before the 2022 midterm elections despite a lower court ruling the map discriminated against Black people. North Dakota is home to five federally recognized tribes, with American Indian and Alaska Native people making up about 6% of the state’s population. Some tribal members in the state do support the new map, as the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation in western North Dakota was placed in a subdistrict, as it requested. But for Yankton, who said committee members never came to the Spirit Lake or Turtle Mountain reservations during the redistricting process despite requests, the map is the latest voting rights injustice for Native people: “It’s violating our democratic right, as citizens of North Dakota, to participate and support people who choose to run for whatever offices. And it hinders us from even having a chance as Native Americans to run for offices.”",News/US news,Native American tribes sue North Dakota over ‘sickening’ gerrymandering,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/21/native-american-tribes-sue-north-dakota-gerrymandering
2/21/2022,"In 2006, the artist Hayv Kahraman moved to the US, then occupying her homeland, Iraq, and began painting a woman who has been a fixture of her work ever since. With parchment-pale skin, a swoosh of raven hair, scarlet lips and strong brows, this figure recalls the characters set against unadorned backgrounds in 12th-century Baghdad’s miniature painting, while her apple-round breasts and cool, heavy-lidded gaze suggest a quattrocento nude, rendered with the clean lines of Japanese prints. It is a composite identity its maker understands well. Kahraman was 11 when she was smuggled out of Iraq during the first Gulf war. Her family settled in Sweden, where she spent her teens; she now lives in Los Angeles. “As an immigrant, I’ve always felt on the periphery of society,” she says.  Watching her mother work as a translator for government agencies, Kahraman saw the demand for refugees to repeat their trauma. “It creates an economy of pain where suffering becomes a currency,” she says. “So how do we get unstuck? How do we not only survive but thrive?” In the past 15 years she has used her painted women to investigate the refugee condition from often surprising angles. The figures have become contortionists; canvases have been sliced up and rewoven into abstract patterns, in an allegory of the fragmented nature of memory, culture and trauma. A recent Covid-centric series interrogated the martial language of immunology, in which the human fortress is seen to be “invaded” or “colonised” by foreign bodies. Her latest exhibition, Gut Feelings, draws on recent research into the possibility of actively “rewiring” neural pathways through the gut microbiome. “The bacteria in our gut is responsible for regulating hormones like dopamine and serotonin that give us feelings,” she says. It is clear, though, from her work’s unsettling tone, that she sees any restorative process as complicated. Beauty is tempered by a jolt of body horror as the women in her paintings strike acrobat poses, entangled in thick, intestine-like nets, or crouch low, passing ropes of lilac guts between them. In small canvases she calls “neurobusts”, a woman’s body has been fragmented into a bust and displayed on a steel rod like a museum artefact. Sausage-like innards protrude from her mouth. Umbilical cords and blowjobs come to mind. These challenging images make us reflect on what we are taught to consider “normal”: “I was brainwashed into thinking anything Euro-American-centric is the ideal,” Kahraman says. The ambiguity that permeates Kahraman’s work goes far beyond its mix of the gorgeous and grotesque. Are these female prisoners or nest-builders, nurtured or force-fed? “It’s not about erasing the pain and entanglement,” she says. “It’s about thinking, feeling and working through it.” Entanglements With Torshi, 2021Kahraman has found novel ways to “collaborate with microbes” in her paintings exploring the gut microbiome. The lilac in this painting comes from the Middle Eastern beetroot torshi. “Bacteria permeates the vegetables to create this fermented food,” she says. “My mum and I used to paint with it when I was a kid.” Neurobust No 1, 2021 (pictured top)Kahraman’s interest in neuroscience began with the loss of her mother. The artist discovered that one of the last books she had been reading before her death concerned “neurosculpting”, the potential for changing neural pathways that were previously considered set. “In the field of PTSD, this is massive,” she says. “It was interesting that she, an Iraqi immigrant, had chosen this book.” Beard-Gut-Brain Axis, 2021Kahraman has begun experimenting with painting on flax, another product of bacteria permeating a plant – and what linen is made from. Linen had a strong association with Venice, “the heart of European aesthetics”, she says. “I want to dismantle that.” Entanglements No 1, 2021The artist typically uses her own body as a model, however she doesn’t see her figures as self-portraits. “It’s not individualistic; it’s more about creating a collective of women,” she says.

2/21/2022,"A warehousing company that counts John Lewis, Marks & Spencer, Morrisons and Asda among its customers has agreed a possible takeover deal worth up to £940m with a New York rival, in the latest sign of the boom in online delivery. The board of Clipper Logistics, headquartered in Leeds, unanimously recommended the possible takeover offer by New York-listed GXO Logistics of 690p a share plus shares in the Connecticut-based company worth up to 230p for each Clipper share.  Clipper’s shares jumped by 14% on Monday morning to 887p, near their record high of 910p. Warehouses have become a huge growth business in the past decade, particularly during the coronavirus pandemic, as online shopping has accounted for an ever greater share of total spending. The shift to online shopping accelerated even faster during lockdowns. Clipper serves fast-growing retailers such as Boohoo, Asos and JD Sports, and in the UK supermarket deliveries also expanded rapidly. Clipper is mainly focused on clothing, with retailers outsourcing their online deliveries to the company, which manages stock and picks and packages clothes in its warehouses. It also handles clothing returns, an important and costly issue for fashion retailers. Clipper, which claimed £3.8m from the UK government under the coronavirus job retention scheme, also benefited during the pandemic from the UK government’s massive spending on personal protective equipment (PPE), in deals that drew scrutiny because of Clipper founder Steve Parkin’s donations to the Conservative party worth £730,000. Clipper said it has processed more than 1bn PPE items during the pandemic and it described its newly created PPE unit as a “development opportunity” in its annual report. Parkin, who holds 15% of the Clipper shares, has promised to vote in favour of the deal. Clipper and GXO said the deal offered a “highly attractive valuation”, with a premium of 49% compared with the day before the offer was made. However, the premium was only 18% compared with Clipper’s closing price on Friday. Shareholders may be able to mix the proportion of shares and cash that they receive if a firm offer is made and they vote in favour. Parkin started Clipper in 1992 with a single van delivering clothes for fashion retailers, according to the Yorkshire Post. Since then it has grown to 10,000 employees in 55 sites in the UK, Poland, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and Belgium. GXO was part of another US warehouse and trucking company, XPO Logistics, until August when it was spun out and listed separately.

2/21/2022,"The family of a 16-year-old boy who died after the trail bike he was riding and an unmarked police car crashed in Sydney has called for an independent inquiry into the death. Police have launched a critical incident investigation into Saturday’s crash that killed Indigenous teenager Jai Wright, but his father Lachlan Wright says an independent inquiry is needed. He claimed police had told the family two different versions of what happened, and the family want to know if Jai was being pursued by police at the time of the crash.  Jai, a former International Grammar School student who was undertaking an electrical apprenticeship, died on Sunday afternoon after suffering serious head injuries in the crash in Alexandria on Saturday morning. Lachlan Wright said his family deserved to know exactly what happened to their “bright and lively boy”. “We’ve been given inconsistent information by police as to what caused our child’s death,” he said outside the Royal Prince Alfred hospital on Monday. “Any parent wants to know how their little boy has died. That is why we are calling for entirely independent inquiry away from the police.” The distraught father said police initially told the family that an unmarked police car “turned in front of Jai”, causing the teen to crash. But he said police later the same day “told us that there was no pursuit and … the police car was parked and Jai lost control of his bike and ran into the police car”. Wright said the family felt “disrespected” by New South Wales police. He is calling on anyone who saw the crash, has CCTV of the incident or knows anything about what happened to come forward. New South Wales police on Monday declined to answer questions regarding the crash. In a statement, police said officers noticed two suspected stolen vehicles – one of which was a blue 2019 Sherco trail bike – around 7am on Saturday near Enmore Road and King Street in Newtown. Police allege the bike was last seen turning right into Sydney Park Road in Alexandria before it was involved in a crash with the unmarked police car at the intersection of Henderson and Mitchell roads in Alexandria at 7.35am. Jai was treated at the scene by paramedics, before being taken to the Royal Prince Alfred hospital where he died on Sunday afternoon. Police say a critical incident team from Sydney City Police Area Command is investigating the circumstances surrounding the crash, with the investigation subject to an independent review. Speaking outside the hospital alongside two of Jai’s brothers, Marli and Kaidyn, as well as Jai’s mother, Kylie, Lachlan Wright described Jai as “our loving boy”. “He finished year 10 last year and started an electrician’s apprenticeship. He’s not going to be able to finish that,” Wright said. “He just seemed to get along with everyone. No one really had a bad thing to say about him. “His little little brother would say that ‘Jai Jai’ is his favourite and he’s never gonna say it again.”",News/Australia news,‘Inconsistent information’: family calls for independent inquiry into Sydney teen’s death after police crash,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/21/inconsistent-information-family-calls-for-independent-inquiry-into-sydney-teens-death-after-police-crash
2/21/2022,"Aveteran of the hip-hop scene and internationally celebrated breakdancer, Nancy Yu – AKA Asia One – has her fair share of people contacting her looking for advice. But the message she received in 2019 from a young Afghan was a little different.  Frustrated by his breakdancing crew’s inability to get visas to perform internationally, Moshtagh* was wondering if Asia could help. “He felt they were really good, but they felt, like, invisible to the world,” she says. “I liked him. He wasn’t trying to bug me or say ‘we need this right now’ … He seemed rather humble and honest.” Over the months, a friendship grew between Kabul and California, based on mutual respect and an appreciation of hip-hop culture. Moshtagh, who is in his 20s, felt he had a lot to learn from Asia, a one-time member of the Rock Steady Crew who set up the B-Boy summit, a global gathering celebrating all the elements of hip-hop: breakdancing, DJ-ing, rapping and graffiti. Only once has her belief in Moshtagh’s humility been severely challenged: when he declared, with youthful bravado, that he could be better than Tupac Shakur. “I was, like, ‘you’re out of your mind’,” Asia laughs. Last year, as the Taliban made sweeping gains across Afghanistan and even the modest freedoms enjoyed by many young people in Kabul started to feel in doubt, Moshtagh’s messages became more serious and urgent. And in the summer, as the Taliban took the capital, came the decision: the hip-hoppers, he told Asia, were leaving. It was a decision “based on complete fear”, says Asia. “You know, just that overwhelming sense of survival, that ‘if we don’t leave now, we don’t know what’s going to happen to us. And so we’re gonna risk our chance’. Because … they felt so threatened by the Taliban based on their western practices.” Now Moshtagh was asking his American mentor for different help: “He said, I feel like you guys have an obligation to help us and I was like, what do you mean?” she recalls. “And he said, well, you know, we’re all just hip-hop family. And … the more and more we spoke, the more and more I realised that much of what he was saying was true.” Ever since hip-hop first erupted in the Bronx apartment blocks of 1970s New York, its social conscience has never been far away. From the daily struggles of black America to the war on drugs to police brutality, there is little about life on the margins that hasn’t been rapped, sprayed on walls, chanted at rallies. (During the summer of 2020, it was a 1989 Public Enemy anthem that echoed at many of the protests over George Floyd’s murder. “Gotta give us what we want./ Gotta give us what we need./… We’ve gotta fight the powers that be.”) In the era of billionaire rappers and ostentatious bling, it can be easy for that activist spirit to get lost. But for Asia, who heads No Easy Props, a nonprofit running hip-hop events and classes for marginalised communities in Los Angeles, it is intrinsic to the scene and partly why she felt touched by Moshtagh. “It awoke my thought process. Here are some people that feel invisible. And hip-hop was started by a group of people that felt invisible,” she says. “To me, not being able to practise hip-hop is one thing, and not being able to live is another thing,” she says. Within days of his request for help, she started to mobilise. Moshtagh is a mild-mannered man in his 20s whose spoken English is heavily flavoured by hip-hop. He speaks of “homies,” of “breakers”, of “B-girls” and “B-boys”. As a teenager in Hamid Karzai’s Afghanistan, he fell for the moves he saw in videos of breakdancers from far away, and set about trying to become just like them – perhaps even better. In a country that retained a deep social conservatism long after the Taliban were toppled in 2001, it was not an easy path. “People didn’t accept hip-hop,” says Moshtagh. “They were just thinking that this has music: ‘it’s haram, you can’t do it, it’s illegal. What is this western culture that you guys are promoting?’ But we were just thinking we are modern people; young people need to look for modern things, and we love to do this.” Despite disapproval and threats, he and his friends made progress. “We changed people in 10 years but everything fell apart,” he says. “That building that we built, actually, it’s destroyed. There’s nothing for us to do in Afghanistan any more.” On 18 August, three days after the Taliban overthrew Ashraf Ghani’s government, Moshtagh left Afghanistan, along with some of his “homies”. They have been in a neighbouring country ever since, trying to remain hopeful butconstantly worrying about the future. “Actually, we don’t care about ourselves that much,” says Moshtagh, via Zoom, his five-year-old sister bobbing up and down in the background. “We’re just thinking about our family members. We don’t want them to be in a hard situation because of us, because of what we were doing. It’s all on our shoulders.” According to Menno van Gorp, a Dutch breakdancer with more than 100,000 Instagram followers who has been in touch with him for years, Moshtagh “is a guy that carries a lot of responsibility for the people around him … He’s the one that keeps the wheel spinning.” Alongside Moshtagh, there are 19 in the group, including two children and six women. A mixture of breakdancers, rap artists, parkourists and family members, they feel there is no place for them in Afghanistan today. “I’m sure they [the Taliban] would not accept it. There’s no space [for it],” he says. Some of the group have openly criticised the Taliban. Adding to the group’s fear is their ethnic background: all but three are Hazara, the most discriminated against minority group in the country. For one of the dancers there is the additional complication of being a woman. Before leaving Kabul, Haleema* had been hoping to compete in the 2024 Olympics – the first to have breakdancing as an official sport. When she first saw videos of people doing it she thought it must be “a kind of Photoshop” but she trained hard, and received threats to her life for doing so. But she knew she could not continue under the Taliban: the group have made their opposition to female sport clear, and breaking has the additional stigma of also being a form of dance. So inextricably connected is Haleema’s life to hip-hop, she, too, decided to leave. She insists it was not a difficult decision. “I am very young,” she says. “At my age, there is no impossible.” Van Gorp says that for years, amid chronic national instability, hip-hop gave Moshtagh and the others sanctuary. “Breaking was the thing that kept them sane,” he says. “Like, they call it ‘hip-hope’ instead of hip-hop.” Even now, in limbo, unable to go out, Haleema still dreams of competing in the Olympics. “I am just trying to find a way to get out, and to train,” she says. “I’ve got hope for the future because of the people that are helping us.” By last autumn, Asia One had built up a small but dedicated team for the #SaveAfghanHiphoppers mission. “Hip-hop culture is about giving back, so let’s help our community members in need,” reads the campaign website. They raised nearly $14,000 (£10,000) to cover the group’s basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter, as well as initial legal costs. But time is ticking on, and the costs are likely to mount, so the campaign is keen for people to donate. Nearly six months after they fled, the group is still hoping to be granted passage to a country that will give them asylum. For now, the hip-hoppers, many without passports, remain in hiding lest they are arrested and deported back to Afghanistan. “If we raise $50,000, we can get them out of there,” says Asia. “We think it’s actually very possible.” The mission’s lawyer, Jaclyn Fortini Laing, is working to find a country willing to take the hip-hoppers. The US and the UK, both key to Afghanistan’s recent history and global hip-hop culture, have proved dead ends. That’s a shame for the group and the countries in question, says Fortini Laing. “The ideals that [the hip-hoppers] stand for – freedom of speech, women’s rights – are the ideals that make them a target for the Taliban but would make them an asset to any other country that was willing to take them in,” she says. “Failure,” she says, “is not an option.” Equally determined for the mission to succeed is Michael Holman, a pioneer of hip-hop’s first wave who has gone on to have an eclectic career as a Broadway producer, film-maker and musician. When Asia rang around to see who might be willing to help the Afghans, he was one of the few who said yes. “I was like, I can’t say no,” he says. Holman, 66, is believed to be the first writer to have used the phrase “hip-hop” in print: in a 1982 interview with Universal Zulu Nation’s DJ Afrika Bambaataa for the East Village Eye, he defines “the all-inclusive tag for the rapping, breaking, graffiti, crew fashion wearing street sub-culture”. (Elsewhere in the article he rhapsodises about an evening at the Ritz where Zulu Nation “threw down” a Rolling Stones track: “Honky Tonk Woman never rocked so hard!”) Heavily involved in the early days of Grandmaster Flash and the Beastie Boys, Holman helped introduce the “park-jam culture” that had emerged uptown to downtown Manhattan, and then to the world. In 1981, he took Malcolm McLaren to the Bronx to see what all the fuss was about and, “blown away”, the former Sex Pistols’ manager asked him to put together a show featuring Jazzy Jay and Rock Steady Crew. Holman built an extensive archive of video footage, partly from his short-lived TV show, Graffiti Rock; films from the dawn of hip-hop that went all over the world. “[They] were horrible copies,” he says. “But those tapes were how these dancers learn how to dance around the world.” So he felt duty-bound to help. “I felt I owed them something,” he says. “I was a mentor, in a way, by spreading this culture, and they embraced it because I and other people like me made it a compelling, exciting and undeniable cultural thing. I now owed them something. I had a responsibility not only as a hip-hop pioneer and impresario but I now owed them something as an American.” Moshtagh has many questions for the US, widely criticised for its rushed, chaotic departure from Afghanistan. Questions, too, for the UK, which supported its 20-year mission. “Your countries came to Afghanistan to bring peace; you spent a lot of money … And now you left these people alone. Why don’t you care about them?” he asks. He doesn’t know where he will end up. Spain or Belgium appear the most likely candidates, but the process is bogged down in diplomatic negotiations. Van Gorp, in Rotterdam, is optimistic that, wherever they go, there will be a community ready-made for them. “Breaking is such a good bridge to connect with local people because it’s so open and welcoming,” he says. “It will really help them settle. So, like, wherever they will go there will be B-boys they can connect with and they will already have a small network.” Moshtagh doesn’t know if he will see Afghanistan again. He wants to be in a safe place. “It doesn’t matter [where]. This Earth is my home. Earth is for human beings,” he says. Haleema just wants the agonising uncertainty to end. “[In] real life, you’re free to do all the things that you want,” she says, simply. “I want to live free.” * Names have been changed Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",News/Global development,‘We’re all hip-hop family’: the artists fighting to get Afghan breakdancers to safety,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/21/were-all-hip-hop-family-the-artists-fighting-to-get-afghan-breakdancers-to-safety
2/21/2022,"Hundreds of people were evacuated from their homes as the approach of Storm Franklin overnight caused heavy rain and flooding. There was severe flooding in parts of Northern Ireland, and more than 150 flood warnings are in place across the north of England, with Yorkshire and Manchester the worst-hit. The Environment Agency said people in more than 400 homes in south Manchester were told to evacuate after two severe flood warnings indicated a danger to life.  Train operators urged people on Monday to avoid travel if possible as services in some parts of the country experience severe disruption and are expected to be halted by gale-force winds and heavy rain. It came as stretches of two motorways were closed after incidents during the storm. National Highways said the M60 in Greater Manchester was closed between junctions 10 and 11 due to an overturned HGV, which had come to rest on the central reservation. The M6 was closed in Lancashire between junction 27 and 28 after an HGV hit a bridge and caught fire. A spokesperson for Lancashire fire and rescue service said: “By 7am, the fire had been extinguished using four breathing apparatus and three hose reels and the M6 southbound had reopened.” It comes only days after Storm Eunice killed at least four people and left 1.4m homes without power, with about 56,000 yet to be reconnected. On Sunday evening, the Met Office issued an amber warning for wind which could cause a “risk to life” for Northern Ireland until 7am, and a milder yellow wind warning covering England, Wales and south-west Scotland from midday until 1pm. Environment agencies have issued hundreds of alerts for flooding across the country, including two rare “severe” warnings where rainfall could also pose a danger to life for communities along the River Mersey in Didsbury and Northenden, Greater Manchester. In Northern Ireland, heavy rain caused severe flooding, with Londonderry and Tyrone the worst-hit. There were efforts to prevent the Drumragh and Finn rivers from bursting their banks, with workers using pumps to try to contain the water. In Sprotbrough, South Yorkshire, the River Don burst its banks on Sunday evening with the area’s footpaths submerged, and police have warned people to stay away from dangerous fast-flowing water. North Yorkshire fire service was called in to help evacuate several Knaresborough residents as waters rose. In Shropshire, the River Severn was threatening to burst its banks and emergency teams have erected flood barriers in Ironbridge to try to prevent the waters from reaching homes. On Monday, Northern Rail issued a “do not travel” alert to passengers, while TransPennine Express is strongly urging customers to avoid travel if possible, particularly those planning to travel north of Preston in Lancashire before 10am. Great Western Railway urged customers to travel only if absolutely necessary as services are expected to be “significantly disrupted across the network”. South Western Railway also urged customers not to travel, warning the weather conditions were “likely to hamper efforts to help stranded customers”. National Rail warned anyone making essential journeys once services resume to expect major disruption to routes across most of the country including cancellations, delays and slower speeds onboard. Met Office meteorologist Becky Mitchell said last week marked the first time three major storms: Dudley, Eunice and Franklin, had been recorded within seven days since the naming system began in 2015. High winds could cause further power cuts, transport delays and damage to properties, the Met Office warned. Gusts of 60 to 70mph were predicted to hit inland Northern Ireland in the early hours of Monday morning, while 80mph speeds were expected on the coast. Gales of up to 60mph were expected to sweep the rest of the region. The Environment Agency has issued 183 warnings where “flooding is likely” for locations mainly in the north and west of England, and 172 alerts where “flooding is possible” for the north-western half of the UK, London and the south coast. Eighteen flood warnings and seven alerts have been issued across the Scottish Borders, Ayrshire, Orkney and the Western Isles by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency Natural Resources Wales has issued 26 flood warnings and 47 alerts covering much of the country.",News/UK news,Storm Franklin: hundreds evacuated and travel halted across UK,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/21/storm-frankin-hundreds-evacuated-and-travel-halted-uk
2/21/2022,"Companies will have to pay for testing and decide policies on self-isolation for staff, a business minister has said in advance of Boris Johnson’s formal announcement that all remaining domestic Covid restrictions in England will end. Ahead of the prime minister’s scheduled statement on the government’s long-term strategy for living with coronavirus, Paul Scully said free testing would be phased out, arguing the money spent on it could be used better elsewhere.  “We don’t test for flu, we don’t test for other diseases, and if the variants continue to be as mild as Omicron then there’s a question mark as to whether people will go through that regular testing anyway,” Scully told Times Radio. “But if employers want to be paying (for) tests and continuing a testing regime within their workplace, then that will be for them to pay at that point,” he said, adding that while the impact on the virus on clinically vulnerable people was a concern, “we’re not going to be having a testing regime for the next 50 years”. Under a plan being rubber-stamped by the cabinet on Monday morning, and outlined by Johnson in a Commons statement and subsequent press conference, the legal requirement for anyone with Covid to isolate will be ditched a month earlier than planned. Free PCR and lateral flow tests for all will be axed to rein in public spending as ministers attempt to restore people’s confidence that life can return to normality. The tests will reportedly be kept for the over-80s. The national contact tracing service is expected to be wound down and schoolchildren will no longer be told to get tested twice a week. In a separate interview with Sky News, Scully said it would be down to individuals and employers to decide over self-isolating. “I would say that it’s like any illness, frankly, any transmissible illness that you would say stay at home,” he said. Asked what staff could do if forced to work when ill with Covid, Scully said: “This is why we need to make sure that we’ve got really good guidance for employers. “But as I say, there will come a time when the pandemic moves to more of an endemic approach to Covid, in the same way that flu and other viruses are treated, and that’s what we’ve got to get back to.” Saying people should not “work and live under government diktat for a moment longer than is necessary”, Scully said the £2bn spent per month on free lateral flow tests could be better used elsewhere. “If you think what that £2bn might go towards, there’s a lot of other backlogs in the NHS, other illnesses in the NHS, that that money could otherwise go for,” he said. “So for every person that is worried about a test, there may be another person that’s worried about a cancer diagnosis, for instance.”",News/World news,Employers in England will have to pay for Covid testing as rules relaxed,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/covid-rules-relaxed-england-employers-pay
2/21/2022,"Ben Roberts-Smith swore at a superior officer and threatened him, saying “I should smash your face in” during a drinking session at the SAS’s unofficial Afghanistan bar, The Fat Ladies’ Arms, the federal court heard on Monday. Roberts-Smith, a recipient of the Victoria Cross, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of reports he alleges are defamatory and portray him as committing war crimes, including murder, as well as acts of bullying and domestic violence.  The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies any wrongdoing. A serving captain – now a lieutenant colonel – in the Australian army told the federal court on Monday he had been invited to drink at the SAS bar in June 2006. When the officer overheard Roberts-Smith describing a firefight during a mission that day – “I was watching the expression on the guy’s face as the bullets came closer” – the officer said he turned to look at Roberts-Smith. “What the fuck are you doing here? I should smash your face in,” Roberts-Smith allegedly told his superior. He told the court a warrant officer in the bar responded: “Pull your fucking head in, RS,” using Roberts-Smith’s nickname. The officer, known before court as Person 69 and giving evidence for the newspapers as part of their defence, said he was “shocked” to be threatened by a comrade. “I was in shock, I had never been spoken to that way by a subordinate.” “I’ve been threatened three times by my own team in my army career. I can tell you exactly the year, who it was and what they said. Because it had a profound impact on me that my own team would threaten me.” Under cross-examination, Person 69 was questioned why he did not formally reprimand Roberts-Smith. He said he did not take subsequent action because he felt the incident had been sufficiently dealt with by the warrant officer, and there had been no further antagonism from Roberts-Smith. Bruce McClintock, acting for Roberts-Smith, put it to Person 69 he took no action against Roberts-Smith because the incident never happened. “It absolutely did,” Person 69 said. The alleged conversation was put to Roberts-Smith in the witness box last year; he denied making the comment. The court heard the alleged incident at the Fat Ladies’ Arms took place the night after Roberts-Smith and his patrol returned from a mission at Koran Ghar overlooking the Chora Pass. Roberts-Smith’s patrol had been engaged in a significant firefight, encircled on a mountaintop by Taliban fighters and only able to be extracted with significant air support. Roberts-Smith and Matthew Locke, later killed in action, were both awarded the Medal for Gallantry for their actions on the mountaintop. The trial last week heard from another SAS soldier on that mission, anonymised before the court as Person One. The court heard evidence Person One did not perform well during the mission. He had forgotten to bring oil for his machine gun, which subsequently jammed, and told the court he was abused by Roberts-Smith for endangering the patrol. On Monday, Person 69 said the day after that mission he overheard an SAS soldier – whose name he did not know, – in a barracks accommodation telling another soldier about the Koran Ghar mission. The soldier said he had not fired on a young Afghan male who was seen walking across the mountainside because the young man was a reasonable distance away and “carrying no ICOM [radio], no weapon and no webbing”. The newspapers lawyers say that soldier was understood to be Person One. Person 69 said he heard the soldier say that Roberts-Smith “started to yell and abuse me” for not firing at the man. The soldier said Roberts-Smith later returned with the late Sergeant Matt Locke and said “we’ve killed him”. Person one said he “didn’t know what to do”. “I interjected [in the conversation] at this point,” Person 69 said, “and said, ‘you should probably tell someone about that’.” The soldier who said he’d been abused said: “There’s no point.” The soldier talked about his weapons stoppage, and said Roberts-Smith abused him again on their return from the operation and that “the patrol ostracised me”. Person 69 said: “I’d never worked with the Australian SAS before and I was shocked that they weren’t a collegiate team. I’d worked with other special forces … everyone makes mistakes and I couldn’t believe a junior trooper would get abused for not (doing) the right thing rather than being supported.” Person One told the court last week Roberts-Smith had threatened him after the Koran Ghar mission, telling him: “If your performance doesn’t improve on our next patrol, you’re going to get a bullet in the back of the head.” He said he interpreted the comment as a “death threat” and “it made me fearful for my personal safety”. Under cross-examination, Person One denied Roberts-Smith’s words were a warning he was in danger of being shot by the Taliban unless his performance improved. Roberts-Smith has previously told the court the man he and Locke killed on the Koran Ghar was a Taliban spotter who was a legitimate target. In his evidence last week, Person One agreed the man could have been a legitimate target. Earlier on Monday, another soldier, who has spent more than 30 years in the defence forces including a decade in the SAS, gave evidence on behalf of the newspapers that he took Person One on to his patrol in Afghanistan after he was removed from Roberts-Smith’s patrol following the Koran Ghar mission. The senior soldier, Person 21, told the court he was tasked with assessing Person One’s performance and fitness to remain in the SAS after Person One had received some negative performance reviews. “Initially, Person One didn’t want to speak about his experience in Ben Roberts-Smith’s patrol,” Person 21 said. “Eventually he told me he was threatened and he did not feel comfortable or safe.” Person 21 said Person One later told him that “Ben Roberts-Smith told me he was going to fuck me off out of the unit”. He said Person One also said “something along the lines of … ‘he threatened to kill me’”. Person 21 said he was disturbed by a lack of camaraderie and support within Roberts-Smith’s patrol. He said he had seen Person One and other soldiers “left to fend for themselves” as they prepared for the difficult mission on Koran Ghar. Under cross-examination, Person 21 said Person One grew in confidence during operations together, and said he developed into a confident and capable soldier. In his earlier evidence before the court, Roberts-Smith denied accusations of bullying. “I’ve never bullied Person One,” he said. He told the court Person One just wasn’t a “very good soldier” who wanted to cover up his poor performance. “It’s always been the case,” he said. “After the battle in Chora I said words to the effect that I didn’t think he should be in the unit and should probably be considering moving back to the regular army.” Roberts-Smith said he never threatened Person One or swore at him.

2/21/2022,"Daniel Wiles’s brutal, breviloquent debut novel opens with the first of many striking scenes that make strange and freshly terrifying a well-worn chapter in British history: the Industrial Revolution. Picture a dozen people trapped in a cage suspended on a huge iron chain, while beyond its bars, legions more scurry around a “vast sea of black land”. When eventually the cage moves, with a sound like “the cracking of fingerbones”, its momentum is downwards, deep into the belly of the Earth, where lamplit tunnels are filled with satanic bellowing, sweat and chokedamp. The year is 1872 and the setting a small Black Country village whose landscape and social fabric are being savagely refashioned by its three collieries. Among those caged miners is Michael Cash, who has taken a second job in order to send his six-year-old son to school. Having himself started work while still a boy, labour that’s left him scarred by memories too lightless to coalesce into pictures, he’s determined that this won’t be his lad’s fate. But when taking that second job loses him his first, he feels his careful plan slipping through his fingers.  As a last resort, he asks a vicar to pray for him. From that moment on, his actions are determined by perceived “signs”, none greater than the gold he finds while hewing coal. It seems like the answer to all his prayers, except that his sly workmate, Cain, has plans of his own. Soon, Michael is tearing off on a quest that will take him by canal to Dudley, the burning heart of the Industrial Revolution, a place where sinister fogs swirl and the night glows red. The gold exerts a fatal hold over Michael and goads his masculine pride, but his obsession is fired by more than hardship: finding it had felt like proof of some greater meaning, something beyond the deathly toil and dreamless sleep that comprises his days, and he is a man desperate to believe, even if it means compromising everything he’s clung to until now. Wiles, who is from Walsall and the recipient of the UEA Booker prize foundation scholarship, has a keen eye for unnerving detail and the linguistic skill to do it justice. Here’s Cain, for instance, “his nose daftly small like a shirt pocket button and stabbing silver eyes that shone oddly bright”. When it comes to depicting the environmental toll of industry’s speed and greed, he conjures up a hell-scape, a land that looks “as though it had been pulled up from what was once underneath: an open wound” and contrasts sharply with images of snow-covered fields and laughing gulls. The climate crisis is already spurring a reappraisal of the Industrial Revolution, but Mercia’s Take does something else, too: it gives voice to the long-buried experience of miners like Michael, whose lives became fodder for progress, and it does so in their own accents and argot, setting Wiles’s propulsive plot to a rhythmic beat. If this occasionally results in some jarring shifts as the novel toggles between vocabularies, and if the experimental note struck by its stark ending doesn’t feel altogether necessary, given the force of the prose and storytelling that precede it, then these are very small quibbles.
