4/13/2022,"Millions of New Yorkers began their commutes to work and school on Wednesday morning as law enforcement continued searching for the gunman who shot 10 people on a subway train during yesterday’s morning rush hour. At least four school children aged 12 to 16 are believed to be among the injured passengers requiring medical treatment after suffering from bullet wounds, smoke inhalation, falls and panic. Five of 10 people shot were reported to be in critical but stable condition; another 13 were injured, though nobody was reported to be in life-threatening condition. Authorities are offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the capture of the gunman who was wearing a gas mask as he fired 33 shots on the packed train, in what is the worst violent incident on public transit in recent history. No suspects have been named, but the manhunt continued for Frank R James who police have identified as a “person of interest” in the mass shooting. Police found a key to a U-Haul van at the scene which authorities said James, 62, rented in Philadelphia, as well as a 9mm semiautomatic handgun and extended magazines, a hatchet, fireworks, a liquid believed to be gasoline, a black garbage can, detonated and undetonated smoke grenades. James, who has addresses in Wisconsin and Philadelphia, appears to have posted dozens of angry rambling videos on social media in recent years in which he expressed a range of bigoted and bizarre views on topics ranging from mental health services and race to Ukraine. Police released a screenshot of James taken from a YouTube video posted by a channel belonging to the username prophetoftruth88. In a video posted last month, James singled out the city’s new mayor, Eric Adams, by name, criticizing his recently announced public safety policies targeting homeless people in the subway. The security detail for Adams, who is currently at home recovering from Covid, will be strengthened in light of the videos, according to New York’s police commissioner, Keechant Sewell. In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, one neighbor told the New York Times that James walked with a limp, and described him as quiet and unthreatening, while another said he was grumpy, standoffish and weird. By early Wednesday morning, subway service had resumed at the 36th Street station in Sunset Park, Brooklyn as police finished their crime scene investigation. On Tuesday, graphic images had shown chaotic scenes on the platform after the mass shooting, with wounded passengers lying on the ground as others administered tourniquets to stem bleeding from their legs. Other footage recorded as the train pulled into the station showed black smoke pouring out as the doors opened, followed by passengers, some screaming, others stumbling and falling to the platform. Phone images showed blood on the floor of the car. Law enforcement agencies are urging people to send them video footage from the crime scene to assist the manhunt after it was revealed that at least one camera at the subway station failed to capture anything during the attack due to a “malfunction”. Police presence on the subway was beefed up overnight, but Tuesday’s terrifying incident follows a spate of random attacks on the subway which will not help government efforts to convince people that the city’s underground transport system is safe. At least a third of New Yorkers – around 3 million people – ride the subway, but passenger numbers are still down more than 40% compared to pre-pandemic numbers.",News/US news,"Police offer $50,000 reward as search continues for gunman in Brooklyn subway shooting",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/13/brooklyn-subway-shooting-suspect-new-york-latest
4/13/2022,"The chair of the commission that advised on the appointment of the Evening Standard owner Evgeny Lebedev to the House of Lords has been summoned to give evidence to MPs when parliament returns next week. Paul Bew, an Irish historian, will appear before parliament’s public administration committee on Wednesday to answer what its chair described as “very serious questions” about Downing’s Street’s role in the appointment. “We will be holding an evidence session on the role of the House of Lords appointments commission with Lord Bew,” the committee’s Conservative chair, William Wragg, said in a letter to the Labour deputy leader, Angela Rayner. He said members would raise some of the issues regarding Lebedev’s elevation in the session. Controversy has surrounded Lebedev’s appointment to a peerage after it emerged that the commission expressed concerns about his elevation to the Lords and asked Downing Street to reconsider in March 2020 after advice from Britain’s spy agencies. The appointment only went through after it was resubmitted amid pressure from Downing Street. The spy agencies had told the commission that the issue related to his father, Alexander Lebedev, a one-time Moscow spy. During the late cold war period, Lebedev Sr worked undercover at the Soviet embassy in London. His real employer was KGB foreign intelligence, and he left in 1992 with the rank of colonel. Rayner said: “There remain many unanswered questions about how the business partner and son of an ‘ex-KGB’ agent was granted a seat in our parliament. And if the PM overrode security advice to grant this peerage.” Boris Johnson has known Lebedev, who with his father has owned the Standard since 2009, for many years. The prime minister has been a regular guest at parties hosted by Lebedev in London and at his converted castle in Perugia, Italy. After one such event in April 2018 he was seen at a nearby airport reportedly looking as if he had slept in his clothes. Johnson resubmitted Lebedev’s nomination for a peerage in July 2020, to the surprise of some members of the commission. Sources have said that what followed was a “to and fro” between No 10 and the commission, reflecting “concern about his antecedents”. Downing Street then sought further assurances from the security agencies. They said their fundamental assessment about the possible security risk was unchanged, but they also provided extra context, which sources said was enough to lead to a different outcome. The peers reluctantly signed off on Lebedev’s appointment, with sources saying the committee felt “bounced”. In their confirmation letter, they are said to have called on Johnson to examine Russian influence in the Lords, something highlighted by parliament’s intelligence and security committee in its Russia report. Security sources have previously told the Guardian that Lebedev’s “family links” mean he is still regarded as a potential concern. But they estimate the risk to be low, partly because peers do not see classified documents. Downing Street and Lebedev have highlighted his charitable and business activities as reasons for the peerage, and in March after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine reignited the row about his appointment, the peer insisted he was “not some agent of Russia”. Johnson has denied he overruled any security concerns about Lebedev’s appointment. “That is simply incorrect,” he said a little over a month ago.",News/Politics,MPs to question chair of appointments panel over Evgeny Lebedev peerage,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/13/mps-to-question-chair-of-appointments-panel-over-evgeny-lebedev-peerage
4/13/2022,"After two years off because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the London book fair, one of the biggest international literary events, returned in full force last week. Publishers, authors and illustrators gathered at Olympia in Kensington to buy and sell the books we will all be reading next year.So what did we learn from the deals made at the fair? Celebrity writing – from Katie Price to Tyra Banks – is an evergreen trend, but in the wake of Richard Osman’s huge success with The Thursday Murder Club series – and the forthcoming crime debut Murder Before Evensong from the Rev Richard Coles – publishers have ramped up their purchases of celebrity-authored novels. Joining Osman and Coles in the cosy crime genre is Strictly Come Dancing judge Shirley Ballas, who signed with HQ to write two novels with Sheila McClure. Meanwhile, musical theatre’s Michael Ball is publishing a fiction series that charts the stories of two families through the 20th century, via their links to a British theatre. Given the war, it’s unsurprising that people are on the lookout for things that will help them understand Ukrainian/Russian relations. The president of the Ukrainian Publishers and Booksellers’ Association, Oleksandr Afonin, pre-recorded a video for the fair, in which he urged companies to support Ukrainian publishers by donating paper and money, as well by buying rights to publish Ukrainian authors. Victoria Berezko-Frolova’s family memoir Red Sirens was hailed as one of the books of the fair, and rights were sold for The Third World War? by Yuri Felshtinsky with Mikhail Stanchev, which claims to be the first title covering the current Ukraine conflict. Readers’ appetites for new versions of popular – and obscure – tales from Greek and Roman times are limitless, with books from Madeline Miller’s Circe to Kamila Shamsie’s Home Fire being both commercial and critical successes. The latest author to join the fray is Life of Pi’s Yann Martel. The Booker prize winner will publish Son of Nobody, a retelling of the Trojan war with a “modern twist” in 2024. “Unlike Homer’s version, which focuses on nobles and kings, this version reveals the story of an unsung hero, Psoas of Midea, the son of a goatherd, a commoner who leaves his wife and children behind in order to help Menelaus get his beautiful wife back,” a spokesperson from Canongate, Martel’s publisher, said. Among many of the big deals announced at the fair were a number of novels about women in dark and desperate situations, perhaps reflecting current discussions about women’s health and safety. The Nursery by literary agent Szilvia Molnar is about a woman who begins to lose her grip on time after giving birth, while Christina Dalcher’s Vita is a high-concept thriller about a world in which a prosecutor’s life is forfeit if they seek the death penalty for someone who turns out to be innocent. In historical fiction, The Witching Tide by Margaret Meyer is inspired by true events in 1645, following a woman who becomes witness to a witch hunt. The Beholders, by Hester Musson, is about a young maid in the 1870s who finds herself trying to uncover the mysteries of her workplace. Publishers are hoping readers will turn to books to help offset the anxieties of modern life – from the soaring cost of living to the climate crisis. Among the books announced at the fair were Wintering author Katherine May’s Enchantment: Reawakening Wonder in an Anxious Age, which is about nourishment through reconnection, and The Greatest Self Help Book (Is the One Written by You) by author Vex King and his wife, beauty influencer Kaushal Modha, which includes six months of prompts to help readers forge their own paths towards self-love.",Arts/Books,What will we be reading next year?

4/13/2022,"Irish police have made an arrest and warned about the danger of dating apps after the killing and mutilation of two men in separate attacks in County Sligo. The Gardaí arrested the man, who is in his early 20s, on Wednesday in Sligo town after the discovery of two bodies, each with similar injuries. Police urged people who use dating apps to obtain a facial image of the person they intend to meet to be wary of new accounts with few followers and few posts; to notify friends about their dating plans; and to be wary of food and drinks unless they can see the preparation. Officers suspect both killings were linked and were investigating a possible link to a third attack last week in Sligo that left a man with serious facial injuries. At a press conference on Wednesday police appealed to any other victims of recent assaults in the area to come forward. The first body discovered on Monday evening was that of Aidan Moffitt, 41, at his home in Cartron, just outside the town. A single man who lived alone, Moffitt had been repeatedly stabbed, leaving deep wounds. Police are investigating whether it was a hate crime motivated by homophobia. Friends and neighbours paid tribute to Moffitt as a warm, witty, generous man. He had worked in financial services and was a branch secretary of the Fine Gael party. The taoiseach, Micheál Martin, expressed deep concern and condolences to the family. My deepest sympathies to the family and friends of Aidan Moffitt.Deeply concerned by this horrific killing and reports of another violent death in Sligo this morning.I urge anyone with any information to contact gardai. The body of Michael Snee, 58, was discovered on Tuesday night at his home, just over a mile from the scene of the first killing. Snee was also single and lived alone. Local police supported by an armed response unit swarmed a nearby area hours later, leading to the arrest. The arrested man being questioned at Sligo Garda station and can be detained for 24 hours. “We are actively investigating as to whether there is any hate related motive to these murders,” said Ch Supt Aidan Glacken. “Gardaí are also investigating whether Michael and Aidan met their attacker online. Meeting people online is a normal activity. Meeting people online should be a safe activity. But as with any online activity everybody should be aware of personal safety advice, which we have provided on the Garda website.”",News/World news,Irish police arrest man in Sligo town after bodies of two men found,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/irish-police-arrest-man-in-sligo-town-after-two-mens-bodies-found
4/13/2022,"Stephen Pagliuca, the co-owner of the Boston Celtics basketball team, has confirmed his interest in buying Chelsea, saying his takeover would ensure the club continue to be “habitual winners”, would never again try to join a European Super League and would remain at Stamford Bridge. Pagliuca’s bid for Chelsea was included last month on a shortlist of possible takeover options for the club by Raine Group, the US bank handling the sale,but little has been heard from the American, who is co-chairman of Bain Capital, a private investment firm. He has now decided to make his intentions clear ahead of submitting a formal bid prior to Thursday’s deadline. In a statement, the 67-year-old said: “This process has been a disconcerting time for the club and fans. Throughout my life and career, my ethos has always been to operate quietly, with integrity, and let my actions and results speak loudly. However, it is imperative to clarify and assure supporters about our bid group and its commitments, to emphasise how seriously we take our potential responsibility to Chelsea. “Our first focus and goal is to make strategic investments to continue competing for championships and trophies. We will support our players and managers to make sure that Chelsea are habitual winners and title contenders, whether in the Premier League, Champions League or the Women’s Super League [the only Super League we intend competing in, for the record]. In addition, we will continue to invest in the youth academy to develop the stars of the future and we would not be in this process if we did not have a exciting and inclusive vision for Chelsea. “Our second focus will be to continue to cherish and preserve the legacy and traditions of the club. In over 20 years of ownership of the Boston Celtics, we have not once considered changing the name, colours, or logo of the club. This is our guarantee to Chelsea fans. Not only are we committed to remaining at the home of Chelsea, Stamford Bridge, but we are inspired to renovate or redevelop the stadium. Chelsea is a world-class team, in a world-class city, with world-class fans: it deserves a world-class stadium.” Pagliuca’s consortium, which he has confirmed includes Larry Tanenbaum, chairman of the NBA, is complicated by the fact he and a group of co-investors recently purchased a 55% controlling stake in the Italian club Atalanta. Under Uefa rules, two clubs directly or indirectly controlled by the same entity cannot be involved in the same competition, so were a Pagliuca-owned Chelsea and Atalanta to both qualify for next season’s Champions League, one would have to drop out. Pagliuca has, however, made clear he will follow all required rules and regulations to ensure his bid for Chelsea can proceed and be successful. “We will submit a substantial and credible bid proposal – one that we expect will meet the respective requirements and regulations of the Premier League, UK government and Uefa,” he said in his statement. “We pledge to honour our commitment to credibility and good guardianship of Chelsea Football Club from day one.” Pagliuca said he had partnered with Tanenbaum and announced the other members of his consortium as the former Disney chief executive Bob Iger; Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin; businesswoman Elaine Saverin; Golden State Warriors, LA Dodgers and Los Angeles FC co-owner Peter Guber; B Capital founder Raj Ganguly; venture capitalist Jim Breyer; investor John Burbank; and tech entrepreneur Div Turakhia. The other three contenders to buy Chelsea are a consortium led by LA Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly, one led by British businessman Sir Martin Broughton and Lord Sebastian Coe, and the Ricketts family, who own the Chicago Cubs baseball team and have faced a backlash over their desire to buy Chelsea due to accusations of Islamophobia levelled at Joe Ricketts, the family’s patriarch. The Chelsea Supporters’ Trust have publicly voiced concerns about a Ricketts takeover, which has been followed by a fans’ protest outside Stamford Bridge prior to the recent Premier league defeat to Brentford. In response, the Ricketts family has said it “rejects any form of hate in the strongest possible terms”. On Tuesday Ricketts confirmed that if its bid is successful, Lord Karan Bilimoria, a Chelsea fan and founder of Cobra beer, as well as outgoing president of the Confederation of British Industry, will have a seat on the board. “I founded Cobra Beer just down the road from Stamford Bridge and have been a season ticket holder for many years,” said Bilimoria in a statement. “So when Tom Ricketts approached me to discuss a leading role in his bid group, there was no way I could refuse. Tom and the wider group have a proven track record of running successful sports teams and a strong vision for both the club and the local community.” Roman Abramovich, Chelsea’s owner since 2003, put the club up for sale on 2 March in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The 55-year-old was then sanctioned by the government on 10 March, with Downing Street claiming to have proven his links to Vladimir Putin. Chelsea have been granted a special licence to continue operating, though under strict terms, with Abramovich entirely unable to profit from Chelsea’s sale. He has vowed to write off the club’s £1.5bn debt.",Sport/Football,Boston Celtics co-owner vows to ensure Chelsea remain ‘habitual winners’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/12/stephen-pagliuca-vows-to-ensure-chelsea-remain-habitual-winners-roman-abramovich-takeover
4/13/2022,"Joe Biden has upped the ante in his criticisms of Vladimir Putin’s actions in Ukraine by accusing him of genocide, saying the Russian leader is “trying to wipe out the idea of even being Ukrainian”. But how significant is the allegation and how likely is Putin to face genocide charges? Genocide is one of four crimes prosecuted by the international criminal court (ICC) and generally considered to be the most grave. The court defines it as being “characterised by the specific intent to destroy in whole or in part a national, ethnic, racial or religious group by killing its members or by other means: causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; or forcibly transferring children of the group to another group”. The court, based in The Hague in the Netherlands, has been attacked over its limited number of successful prosecutions: 10, all for war crimes and/or crimes against humanity, with none for genocide. When the ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, announced in February that he was opening a case into events in Ukraine he said there was “a reasonable basis to believe that both alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity have been committed”. According to cases listed on the ICC website, it has charged only one person with genocide, the then Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir, in 2009 over the conflict in Darfur. After a 2003 uprising by mainly non-Arab rebels, his government armed, trained and financed bands of Arab nomads to attack villages across Darfur, killing, raping and looting as they went. He has never stood trial, having rejected the authority of the ICC. Even if Putin were to be charged with genocide, like Bashir he would be certain to reject the authority of the court – Russia withdrew from the ICC in 2016. While the ICC has never prosecuted anyone for genocide, there have been convictions at special tribunals. Genocide was first introduced as a legal concept at the Nuremberg trials, where 24 Nazis were indicted after Germany’s surrender in the second world war. It was more than 50 years later, in 1999, that Jean-Paul Akayesu, a small-town Rwandan mayor, became the first of several people to be convicted of genocide by the international criminal tribunal for Rwanda for his part in the mass killings of the civil war that erupted in the small African nation in 1994. Radovan Karadžić, the former Bosnian Serb leader, and the former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladić, were convicted of genocide at the UN-backed international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia over the 1995 Srebrenica massacre. If such a special tribunal were one day to be set up to investigate the war in Ukraine, Putin would be likely to boycott that, too.",News/Law,Will Putin face genocide charges over Ukraine atrocities?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/how-likely-putin-face-genocide-charges-ukraine-atrocities
4/13/2022,"There are some nice lines, game performances, midrange CGI and a worryingly unfunny credits sting in this otherwise likable adventure-comedy in the tradition of Romancing the Stone. Sandra Bullock plays Loretta, the author of a novel franchise-series about a Lara-Croft-type badass discovering exciting secrets in far-flung places with her lover Dash. But Loretta has to live with the fact that her books are bestsellers because of the hunky male model, Alan (Channing Tatum) who always appears on the front covers “playing” Dash – and this temperamental, over-moisturised gym bunny now gets to appear on stage with Loretta on her book tours, preening and pouting like Magic Mike for the simpering fanbase. But when an evil bearded British billionaire (Daniel Radcliffe) kidnaps Loretta and takes her to a mysterious island because he is convinced she can tell him about ancient treasure there, silly Alan has to toughen up and be the swashbuckling hero he dreams of being, by rescuing her. There are some amusing touches and quality cameos, including one from Brad Pitt as the (genuine) tough guy that they initially hire to find Loretta. Bullock duly has a stunned piece of dialogue with him: “Why are you so handsome?” “My dad was a weatherman.” There is also Da’Vine Joy Randolph as Loretta’s manager Beth, who has her own adventure getting to the island to ensure her client is safe. This is all amiable enough, with the all-important dimension of laughs: Tatum and Bullock showing that they are smart enough to know how silly it is, and that they know that we know that they know. There is also a very bizarre scene, apparently inspired by The African Queen, in which Bullock has to pluck blood-sucking slugs from Tatum’s rock-hard buttocks and is then reduced to gibbering inarticulacy at the sight of his penis. I don’t remember Katharine Hepburn doing this with Humphrey Bogart.

4/13/2022,"Draconian lockdown measures introduced in China to combat outbreaks of Covid-19 mean global oil demand will not be as high as expected, the International Energy Agency has said, helping cushion the impact of the dwindling supply from Russia. In its monthly report on world oil markets, the IEA said it expected Russia’s output to fall by 1.5m barrels per day (bpd) in April, with the decline accelerating to 3m bpd from May, as buyers either voluntarily boycott Kremlin-controlled supplies or hold back because of uncertainty over sanctions. The projection indicates that as much as 3% of global supply could be lost by the middle of spring as a result, given Russia’s position as the world’s second-largest oil producer. But there was unlikely to be a “sharp deficit” in global oil markets, the IEA said, thanks to multiple factors mitigating the impact of lost Russian flows. The most recent is the imposition of what it called “stringent” anti-Covid restrictions in China, where the one-party state has put all 26 million people in Shanghai into lockdown. Weaker-than-expected demand in countries of the OECD – a group of mostly developed nations – added to the decline, the Paris-based agency said. As a result, the organisation lowered its global oil demand forecast by 260,000 bpd compared with last month’s prediction and now expects the world to need an average of 99.4m bpd in 2022. The figure is still an increase of 1.9m bpd on 2021 because of the global economic rebound from that year, which was more heavily affected by Covid restrictions around the world. That recovery, coupled with market turmoil caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, had sent oil prices soaring to near record highs. The resulting surge in fuel prices has been felt by motorists in countries including the US and UK, where petrol and diesel have reached a succession of all-time highs, contributing to a mounting cost of living crisis. The IEA’s new lower forecast should now ease concerns about oil prices, particularly given an improved picture on oil output. Global supply increased in March, up by 450,000 bpd to 99.1m bpd, helped in particular by a rise in output from countries that do not belong to the Opec cartel of oil-producing nations. Opec countries, such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, have agreed to a 400,000 bpd increase, but did not go as far as big oil consumers such as the US and India had hoped. IEA member countries have also agreed to a coordinated release of 120m barrels of emergency reserves to help depress the oil price, a move that the organisation said had brought the price of Brent crude down $10 to $104. The price reached $114 during the early days of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and analysts were predicting it could breach the all-time high of $147.50, hit in 2008. However, the IEA releases have contributed to a long-term trend of dwindling reserves, with stocks down for 14 consecutive months. Inventories in February were 740m barrels below levels at the end of 2020, with OECD countries accounting for 70% of the decline.",News/Business,"China’s lockdowns will help lessen global oil demand, predicts IEA",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/13/china-lockdowns-will-help-lessen-global-oil-demand-predicts-iea
