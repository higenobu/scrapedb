3/21/2022,"From the future of the global economy to energy security and defence spending, the shock of Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine is provoking a dizzying rethink of policy priorities and assumptions. The Roman Abramovich-related crisis at Chelsea FC might seem a minor subplot when tectonic plates of such magnitude are shifting. But football’s global reach and modern geopolitical dimensions make it much more than that. The perfectly timed spectacle of last week’s fixture between sanctioned Chelsea and Newcastle United – owned by Riyadh’s sovereign wealth fund – marked a moral nadir for the game, coming one day after Saudi Arabia executed 81 people. It was also shaming for this country. In football, too, a paradigm shift is needed. The tools to effect this – or at least start the job now – are within the government’s grasp. Last April, six leading clubs attempted to join the reviled European Super League project; the horror of their own supporters demonstrated an underlying outrage among fans at the direction the sport has taken. The government set up the fan-led Crouch review on football governance. (As the review panel deliberated on where the game had lost its way, the Premier League waved through the takeover of Newcastle by the fund, chaired by the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.) Published in November, the review calls for the establishment of an independent regulator of the game. The independent regulator for English football (IREF) would be able to examine new potential owners according to various criteria, including an “integrity test”; the judgment would be one of whether prospective buyers would be “suitable custodians of vital community assets”. Tracey Crouch, the Conservative MP who is chair of the review panel, believes that had an integrity test been in place at the time of the Newcastle takeover, better “stress-testing” would have taken place. The Premier League has resisted the proposal (one club director denounced it as “Maoism”). But oligarchs, authoritarian states and – in the case of the Glazer family at Manchester United – asset-strippers, have run rings round the league’s own “fit and proper” test for ownership. This was originally designed to weed out small-time fraudsters and charlatans at lower league level, but has merely operated as a fig leaf of respectability while the game changed beyond recognition. The extraordinary influx of wealth has been amorally treated as a boon for everyone lucky enough to be associated with the richest league in the world. The unprecedented turmoil of the last fortnight should strengthen the government’s resolve to follow up on Ms Crouch’s recommendations. They should be in the next Queen’s speech, and a specific human rights dimension should be incorporated into the IREF’s role. Legislation to introduce a regulator would help to ensure the kind of protection appropriate to cherished national institutions. Politicians often talk about footballers’ responsibility to be role models; what about the clubs themselves? Other Crouch measures – such as a fans’ golden share giving a veto over matters vital to the identity of a club, including the stadium’s location and team colours – would begin to restore a democratic balance between the aristocrats who run clubs and the serfs who fill them. The fate of Chelsea is now subject to a bidding war. But all the focus has been on the wealth of the various corporate entities and hedge funds involved rather than what is best for the fans and the wider game. All but a few hundred Chelsea supporters were excluded on Saturday from attending a classic English football occasion – the FA Cup quarter-final at Middlesbrough – because their sanctioned club is for the time being unable to sell tickets. The ultimate outcome of the deeply unedifying episode that began when Mr Abramovich bought the club in 2003 must be a moral recalibration in the governance of the game.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on geopolitics and the Premier League: time for a divorce | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/20/the-guardian-view-on-geopolitics-and-the-premier-league-time-for-a-divorce
3/21/2022,"The House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) committee has decided that it doesn’t like Unboxed – originally seen as a festival of Brexit – which kicked off without much attention this month. Its report on the government’s handling of major cultural and sporting events concludes that the aims of the year-long, countrywide celebration of British creativity have been “vague and ripe for misinterpretation” from the first; thus, the £120m investment was, it said, “an irresponsible use of public money”. Unboxed is a series of 10 art, science and technology projects with ambitious (if at times amorphous) aims such as sending music to the moon and back, transporting a North Sea oil rig to the beach at Weston-super-Mare and turning it into a multimedia centre, and asking people in Wales to imagine what life might be like in 2052. These are all no doubt admirable, inclusive and challenging, but it is fair to say that they are somewhat removed from the Festival of Britain-type idea that Theresa May announced at the Conservative party conference in 2018 and which Brexit backers imagined would involve flag-waving, bangers and mash, and replays of speeches by Churchill. You would have to have a heart of stone not to laugh at the way their assumptions have been upended. The original notion was that the festival, the Queen’s platinum jubilee and this summer’s Commonwealth Games in Birmingham would come together in a glorious reforging of a newly confident nation. Some hope – with war in Ukraine, Covid still rampant, inflation rising and Brexit divisions far from healed. Julian Knight, the Conservative chair of the DCMS committee, complains that the three-pronged opportunity has been missed: “There is no golden thread linking them all together.” But a country’s elite cannot impose a national narrative. Politicians like to latch on to the sort of unifying “national traditions” that Eric Hobsbawm and others have exposed as bogus, and invest in grand projects such as the Millennium Dome. Such top-down impositions are doomed. TS Eliot hinted at that with his own banal list of what signifies a culture: “a cup final, the dog races, the pin table, the dart board, wensleydale cheese, boiled cabbage cut into sections, beetroot in vinegar, 19th-century Gothic churches, the music of Elgar”. The Festival of Britain in 1951 worked because it was a day out, an antidote to austerity. It captured a moment, but it didn’t encapsulate a culture. Danny Boyle had a good go at telling our “national story” in his widely admired Olympic opening ceremony in 2012 (symbol of a happier age), but even his pastoral-radical retelling was partial. What about the English civil war, the relationship with Ireland, empire, slavery, and postwar decline? Identity is a contested mess that doesn’t lend itself to being contained; it has to be suggestive, tangled, unresolved. Unboxed contends with enduring suspicion about its origins on one side, and scepticism about its results on the other. Its programme suggests it will be admirably true to itself – and almost universally disliked or ignored by those who long for simple stories, linear narratives, easy resolutions. It will stand or fall on whether it can engage and enthuse the wider public.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Unboxed: so much for the ‘festival of Brexit’ | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/20/the-guardian-view-on-unboxed-so-much-for-the-festival-of-brexit
3/21/2022,"Joe Biden’s ambassador to the United Nations warned on Sunday there was little immediate hope of a negotiated end to the war in Ukraine, as pressure continued to build on the US president ahead of a crucial Nato summit in Europe this week. Linda Thomas-Greenfield was reacting on CNN’s State of the Union to an interview with Volodymr Zelenskiy in which the Ukrainian president told the same network only talks would end the war and its devastating toll on civilians. “We have to use any format, any chance, to have the possibility of negotiating, of talking to [Russian president Vladimir] Putin,” Zelenskiy told Fareed Zakaria, the host of GPS. “If these attempts fail, that would mean that this is a third world war.” Thomas-Greenfield said she saw little chance of a breakthrough. “We have supported the negotiations that President Zelenskiy has attempted with the Russians, and I use the word attempted because the negotiations seem to be one-sided, and the Russians have not leaned in to any possibility for a negotiated and diplomatic solution,” she said. “We tried before Russia decided to move forward in this brutal attack on Ukraine and those diplomatic efforts were not responded to well by the Russians, and they’re not responding now. But we’re still hopeful that the Ukrainian effort will end this brutal war.” The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, told NBC’s Meet the Press: “Turkey is doing some real effort to try to facilitate, support talks between Russia and Ukraine. It’s far too early to say whether these talks can lead to any concrete outcome.” Biden, who faces growing dissatisfaction over his approach to the war, will travel to Brussels on Thursday. He will hear a proposal from Poland for Nato to send a peacekeeping force into Ukraine, something Thomas-Greenfield said was unlikely. “I can’t preview what decisions will be made and how Nato will respond to the Polish proposal,” she said. “What I can say is American troops will not be on the ground in Ukraine at this moment. The president has been clear on that. “Other Nato countries may decide that they want to put troops inside of Ukraine, that will be a decision that they have made. We don’t want to escalate this into a war with the United States but we will support our Nato allies.” Thomas-Greenfield was asked about reports that thousands of residents of the besieged city of Mariupol have been deported to Russia. “I’ve only heard it,” she said. “I can’t confirm it. But I can say it is disturbing. It is unconscionable for Russia to force Ukrainian citizens into Russia and put them in what will basically be concentration and prisoner camps.” Republicans were critical of the pace and content of US support for Ukraine. Following Zelenskiy’s address to Congress on Wednesday, the White House announced $800m in military aid, following a $13.6bn package. But Biden has rejected a no-fly zone and the transfer of Polish Mig fighter jets. “The president has had to be pushed and pulled to where he is today,” the Wyoming Republican senator John Barasso told ABC’s This Week. “It was Congress that brought about sanctions, that brought about the ban on Russian oil, that brought about weapons and all of this big aid package. So far the administration has only released $1bn of that. We might not have been in this situation if they had done punishing sanctions before the tanks began to roll.” Speaking to CBS’s Face the Nation, the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, said he believed Biden “needs to step up his game”. The president, McConnell said: “has generally done the right thing but never soon enough. I am perplexed as to why we couldn’t get the Polish-Russian Migs into the country.” McConnell added that Biden should visit friendly countries close to the conflict zone, such as Romania, Poland, and the Baltic nations. “They’re right on the frontlines and need to know that we’re in this fight with them to win,” he said. McConnell also condemned Republican extremists who have opposed support for Ukraine, such as the North Carolina congressman Madison Cawthorne, who has called Zelenskiy “a thug”. “There are some lonely voices out there who are in a different place,” McConnell said. Concern is rising among Biden’s allies. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the Democratic Senate whip, reiterated the call to approve air support for Ukraine. “We’re asking for one-third of the Polish air force to be sent into Ukraine,” he told ABC. The people of Poland, of course, want to make certain that they’re safe. They’re only a few miles away from the devastation that’s going on in Ukraine. “There are other ways for us to provide surface-to-air missiles and air defenses that will keep the Russians at bay in terms of their aerial attacks. There are ways to do that that are consistent with the Nato alliance and would not jeopardise expanding this into world war three or even worse.” Marek Magierowski, the Polish ambassador to the US, stressed that the proposal for a peacekeeping force in Ukraine was only “a preliminary concept”. “We can’t take any decisions unilaterally, they have to be taken by all Nato members,” he told CNN, adding: “If there is an incursion into Nato territory, I believe that Russia can expect a very harsh response on the part of our alliance.” Zelenskiy lamented the provision only of economic and limited military support. “If we were a Nato member, a war wouldn’t have started,” he said. “If Nato members are ready to see us in the alliance, do it immediately because people are dying on a daily basis. “But if you are not ready to preserve the lives of our people, if you just want to see us straddle two worlds, if you want to see us in this dubious position where we don’t understand whether you can accept us or not, you cannot place us in this situation, you cannot force us to be in this limbo.” Zelenskiy, however, appeared to acknowledge last week that Ukraine would not join Nato. On CBS’s Face the Nation, the US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, said the use of chemical weapons by Russia, which many analysts predict, would produce a “significant reaction” from the US and the international community. On NBC, Stoltenberg said the use of chemical weapons “would be a blatant and brutal violation of international law”. But he would not say such an outcome would change Nato policy towards intervention. Biden this week spoke to the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, seeking to prevent support for Russia. The Chinese ambassador to the US, Qin Gang, spoke to CBS. He said: “What China is doing is sending food, medicine, sleeping bags and baby formula, not weapons and ammunition to any party.” Gang also said Chinese condemnation of the Russian invasion, for which some have called, would not “solve the problem”. “I would be surprised if Russia will back down by condemnation,” he said. In Ukraine, fighting continues. The retired US army general and former CIA director David Petraeus told CNN the conflict had reached “a bloody stalemate, with lots of continued damage on both sides, lots of destruction, especially from the Russians”.",News/World news,US not optimistic about Ukraine talks as Zelenskiy ups pressure on Biden,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/zelenskiy-biden-us-ukraine-talks-russia-putin-china-nato
3/21/2022,"My father, Jeffrey Roberts, who has died aged 88 of heart disease, was a British diplomat whose postings took him to Pakistan, Paris, South Africa and Singapore. Born in Warrington, Cheshire, Jeff was the eldest of three sons of Margaret (nee Smith), a domestic servant, and Arthur Roberts, a wire drawer. He attended the local Boteler grammar school, where he excelled in sports. An outstanding gymnast, he played football in the Warrington under-18 league, winning the local Stockton Cup. At the age of 16 Jeff left school to start an apprenticeship as a clerk at Rylands Brothers wireworks in the town. His career was interrupted, though, by a call-up for national service in 1951. His unit was to be sent to Cyprus, but he arrived a day late, missed the boat and instead went into the Intelligence Corps, where he worked on radio intercepts. On demobilisation in 1953, he joined the civil service and spent the first years of his career working at the National Assistance Board in Widnes, helping people not covered by National Insurance. There he met Pamela Waude, and they married in 1966. The following year Jeff joined the Foreign Office and moved to London, where he and Pam bought their family home in Pinner. During his career in the Diplomatic Service, Jeff alternated overseas postings with service at the Foreign Office in Whitehall. From 1969 to 1971, he was in Rawalpindi-Islamabad in west Pakistan, where he supported people migrating to the UK. Next was Johannesburg, South Africa, where he escorted trade missions from the UK. There his two children were born in the 1970s. Further postings came in Paris (1981-84), and finally Singapore (1984-88), where Jeff was first secretary, commercial. In this role he promoted British trade in Singapore, helping UK companies build the country’s first underground rail system and acting as a guide for visiting ministers promoting British interests. In his last posting, in London, he was in charge of the flag cars for British ambassadors overseas, maintaining the fleet of vehicles at all British embassies. After retiring in 1993 he continued to live in north-west London. He loved traditional and Gypsy jazz, and would often go to music festivals. Always very sporty, he was a member of Pinner Hill golf club. He also continued to travel, too, enjoying holidays in Mexico, the US, Mauritius, China and Hong Kong as well as spending New Year’s Eve of the millennium on both sides of the international date line, crossing from Tonga to Samoa. He was a lifelong Labour voter and Guardian reader. He is survived by Pamela, their children, Nancy and me, two grandchildren, Henry and Ben, and by his brothers, Jim and Alan.",News/Politics,Jeffrey Roberts obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/20/jeffrey-roberts-obituary
3/21/2022,"The sacking of P&O Ferries workers (P&O Ferries told it could face unlimited fine if sackings unlawful, 18 March) echoes the treatment meted out to 700 workers at Gate Gourmet who were sacked by megaphone in 2005. These workers, mainly female and of south Asian origin, prepared food for British Airways flights. They were dismissed while attending a meeting called by their union to protest against the imposition of agency workers on their production line. A third of the workforce were subsequently rehired on contracts offering inferior pay and working conditions in a compromise agreement negotiated by their union, the TGWU. Among the remainder, many took voluntary redundancy, while others, including older women, were selected for compulsory redundancy. Some 60 women who refused to accept what they saw as unfair dismissal took their cases to an employment tribunal, and lost. The Gate Gourmet workers’ struggle against hire-and-fire policies has been largely forgotten, but highlighted well-founded fears about cuts in workers’ protection. We need safeguards against employers’ strategies to downgrade workers’ pay and conditions. We also need to resist pitting agency workers against those with secure contracts, British workers against migrant ones, and recognise this as an attack on all workers’ rights. The government’s response to this unfair and potentially illegal flouting of accepted process for large-scale redundancies will be watched carefully, given the steep fall in real wages and living standards across the economy.Prof Sundari AnithaUniversity of LincolnEmeritus Professor Ruth Pearson University of Leeds  P&O Ferries’ action is not exceptional. This old maritime historian remembers similar cavalier disregard for workers 34 years ago. In May 1988, P&O European Ferries sacked 400 personnel at Dover. Untrained crew and strike breakers were recruited in their place, which created a safety risk to passengers. Today P&O is wheeling in agency staff. Same risk. Today P&O says the 20% cut is part of necessary rationalisation. Same excuse. But last time, new Channel Tunnel competition was cited as justification. P&O was out to break union power. The outcome in 1988 was that the courts sequestered the seafarers’ union assets and funds. P&O finished off the National Union of Seamen, which had protected lives in this dangerous trade for over a century. P&O’s past action left seafarers, already one of the most vulnerable occupational groups, even more vulnerable.Dr Jo StanleyMarsden, West Yorkshire  Your explainer (18 March) concludes that the P&O sackings aren’t really due to Brexit. However, it could be argued that, had we not already been out of the EU, this is exactly the sort of thing that would have been blamed on our membership, instead of the normal operation of naked capitalism.Phil CoughlinHoughton-le-Spring, Tyne and Wear  No doubt P&O Ferries factored the potential costs of unfair dismissal into its decision to fire staff without notice.

I currently work 11 hours a week for a local charity.

We could argue about the rights and wrongs of MPs’ second jobs. We could also argue about the rights and wrongs of abrupt earnings caps for those on benefits.

3/21/2022,"The Rugby Football Union has leapt to the defence of Eddie Jones, insisting the under-fire England head coach has the governing body’s full support and making the remarkable claim it is “encouraged by the solid progress” despite another highly disappointing Six Nations campaign. Evidence of progress is thin on the ground after England ended the tournament with a 25-13 defeat in France, ensuring a record of just two wins and three defeats, as was the case 12 months ago. The RFU will conduct a debrief into the campaign in the next fortnight and Jones will hold a review with feedback from his assistants and players, but in terms of his future, the mind of the chief executive, Bill Sweeney, is already made up. Indeed, the RFU expressed no disappointment and made no hint of an apology towards England supporters in its statement. As was the case last year, the debrief will be led by the RFU’s advisory panel which includes Sweeney, the director of performance, Conor O’Shea, and previous England players and coaches, who the union refuses to name. Last year the review lamented a “sub-optimal” campaign and listed a number of excuses for England’s poor performance but Jones emerged blameless. Stuart Barnes, Andy Goode and Austin Healey are among the former England internationals calling for Jones to be sacked but an RFU spokesperson said: “Eddie Jones is building a new England team and against a clear strategy we are encouraged by the solid progress the team has made during this Six Nations campaign. The RFU continues to fully support Eddie, the coaching team and players and we are excited about the summer tour and the progress to rebuild a winning England team. “Eddie and his team of coaches and players will conduct a full review as is normal after each tournament. The RFU advisory panel which consists of board and executive members, former players and coaches along with Eddie will also undertake a debrief to discuss the strong positive steps forward during this campaign and the areas we need to address. The advisory group has been in place since 2019 and it meets regularly both during and after each tournament to evaluate clear targets and progression.” Jones has repeatedly talked of his New England project, insisting that his side would come good by next year’s World Cup. On Sunday he claimed that England were just 3% from where they wanted to be and urged disillusioned supporters to keep faith in him. “They’ve got to have some faith,” he said. “I think I’ve done a reasonable job for England for the past seven years. We’re going through a period now where we’re rebuilding the team and it takes time. We’ve rebuilt the side from the last Six Nations. “I think the progress is very positive. The results aren’t the results we’d like – we’d all like to be winning tournaments and be at the top of the table, but we’re not quite good enough to do that now. But within the next 12 to 14 months when we prepare for the World Cup, we will be.

3/21/2022,"Germany has agreed a contract with Qatar for the supply of liquefied natural gas (LNG) that will help the European country wean itself off its dependency on Russian energy. But the contract is a long-term solution and will do little to slow the current flow of European money into Russian coffers, estimated to be worth $285m (£217m) a day for oil alone. Germany’s economy minister, Robert Habeck, announced the deal after discussions in Doha, where he was accompanied by German business leaders. “It is great that I can say it was firmly agreed to enter into a long-term energy partnership – a cooperation,” Habeck said. “The companies that are now involved in this journey will enter into contract negotiations with the Qatari side.” He gave no detailed figures on planned imports from Qatar. Habeck, a Green party leader in the German coalition government, has faced sharp criticism in recent weeks for refusing to accept a complete energy embargo on Russia, as sought by the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. In a speech to the Bundestag last week, Zelenskiy accused Germany of having only three priorities: “economy, economy, economy”. Polling shows a majority of Germans would be prepared to make sacrifices, including higher gas prices, if it helped defeat Russia, but the German government either does not believe the polling or thinks the public do not understand the real risk of mass unemployment that an embargo would entail. Habeck’s visit to Qatar follows Boris Johnson’s apparently fruitless trip to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in an attempt to persuade two traditional British allies in the Gulf to boost oil production. Qatar is expected to almost double its production of LNG by 2025. Habeck promised that Europe was in the process of reducing its flow of energy from Russia to zero, but at present Germany has no LNG terminals. Two have just been given the go-ahead, at Brunsbüttel and Wilhelmshaven, but may take three years to build. Germany imported about 56bn cubic metres of natural gas from Russia in 2020. Nearly 55% of its gas imports came from Russia, with 40% of the demand for gas in Germany coming from industry. The EU’s total gas imports from Russia are about 168bn cubic metres. In 2020, Qatar exported 106bn cubic metres, selling the bulk of the product to Asian markets. In Doha, Habeck stressed the future for Europe was to develop a diversity of suppliers, and there would be little point in Germany transferring its dependency from one supplier to another. Germany is also in talks with Norway, Canada and the US. He admitted previous German administrations had made a mistake by becoming so dependent on Russia. Moscow also provides 34% of German oil, predominantly along the Druzhba pipeline. As a result Germany has insisted the EU does not sanction two banks that service German purchases of Russian energy. The former head of the Ukrainian state energy company Naftogaz, Andriy Kobolyev, believes Germany could take a tougher line by continuing to take Russian energy but refusing to pay for the gas until Russia pulled out of Ukraine. He said Russia cannot simply turn off the gas supplies, and there would be enough to get Germany through the next winter. Habeck has ruled out reversing the planned switch-off of nuclear power in Germany, scheduled for the end of 2022. But he is said to be open to extending the life of coal powered stations, all due to close by 2030. Disputes inside Germany rage over whether it would be possible to cut off Russian energy. Bruegel, a Brussels-based thinktank, has suggested the EU could survive next winter if all Russian pipeline imports were halted, though it would require painful measures including power rationing. The EU itself has said it aims to reduce the bloc’s gas imports from Russia by nearly two-thirds by the end of 2022, and to make Europe independent from all Russian fossil fuels well before 2030. The French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, hinted France was willing to go further, saying: “Should we immediately stop buying Russian oil, should, a little bit further down the line, we stop importing Russian gas? The president has never ruled out these options.”",News/World news,Germany agrees gas deal with Qatar to help end dependency on Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/germany-gas-deal-qatar-end-energy-dependency-on-russia

MED Theatre was the rural community theatre company he founded to serve Manaton and East Dartmoor. Mark wrote and directed more than 40 plays, incorporating original music and dance, which were performed in the round by casts of amateur actors, and toured to venues across Devon. He was the theatre’s artistic director for 33 years from its foundation in 1989. Though born in Canada, in Powell River, British Columbia, by the age of five he was settled on a Dartmoor farm with his parents, Christopher, a farmer, and Jane (nee Bowater), a writer. From school at Winchester college he went to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study classics, but switched to human sciences. After graduating he returned to live on the farm. I met Mark in 1979 when he was part of a Manpower Services Commission team (that I led) collating information on the archaeology of Devon in the newly formed Sites and Monuments Register in Exeter. A year later, his poem The Walk won a prize in the Observer/Arvon/South Bank Show international poetry competition. Ted Hughes, one of the judges, commented that “both Seamus [Heaney] and myself were very taken by it”. In the same year he married Alison Hastie. They worked closely and productively together on projects including the community theatre, but later divorced. In 1981 Mark undertook a study of blue monkeys on the Zomba plateau of Malawi under the supervision of the primatologist Vernon Reynolds. He was awarded an MPhil in primate ecology from Exeter University in 1986, and was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society. It was observation of the interaction of a “multigenerational assembly” of the blue monkeys that inspired him to found MED Theatre in 1989. Mark’s plays, rooted in the Dartmoor community, explore ecological issues, drawing on folklore, history and culture, often humorously. They were performed by amateur casts of up to 40 people, ranging from schoolchildren to pensioners. Between 1986 and 1990 four of his plays were broadcast on BBC Radio 4, and an extract from his poem The Blue Monkeys of Zomba was read on BBC Radio 3 in 1999. He also founded and edited a free community magazine, the Dart, from 1981 to 2001. Living and writing in his medieval farmhouse, Mark was an important creative voice in Devon for more than four decades. He was an inspirational teacher, gentle, patient and modest, but with an inner strength. He bore decades of spinal pain from ankylosing spondylitis stoically and without complaint. He is survived by his children, Luke and Teffan, four grandchildren, Iris, Poppy, Kit and Monty, and by his siblings, Peter, David and Oona.",Arts/Stage,Mark Beeson obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/20/mark-beeson-obituary
3/21/2022,"When an essay from a prominent Shanghai scholar suggested China needed to cut ties with Vladimir Putin as soon as possible over the Ukraine war, the online reaction was swift. Despite being published late on a Friday evening in the Carter Center’s US-China Perception Monitor, Hu Wei’s essay soon gained a million views in and outside China, and was republished into Chinese blogs, non-official media sites and social media accounts. Then came the backlash, as the article was criticised for being “reckless and dangerous” vitriol. Personal attacks on Hu and the USCPM followed. By Sunday morning, their websites were blocked in China. “Usually when the government or the censors don’t like a particular article – like [something published by] FT Chinese – they’ll just block that particular article, they don’t block the website,” said Liu Yawei, the director of the China programme at the US-based Carter Center. “So this is highly unusual.” China’s position on the invasion and how far it is willing to go in supporting Russia is one of most stridently debated topics of the war, but inside China the conversation is strictly controlled, with little tolerance for dissenting views. “I’d read a lot of commentaries in Chinese media outlets, and Prof Hu’s article certainly disagreed with the majority of those articles,” said Liu. “Hu actually tried to say these are dangerous views … I made the quick decision to put it out.” Published in English and Chinese, Hu’s essay argued that Russia’s advancement was faltering and China needed to cut ties with Putin “as soon as possible” to avoid being on the losing side and facing “further containment” from the US and the west. “China should avoid playing both sides in the same boat, give up being neutral, and choose the mainstream position in the world,” he wrote. Since the 24 February invasion, China has struggled to navigate an awkward position as a close ally of Russia but one unwilling to share the international condemnation and economic sanctions. It has sought to hold incompatible positions respecting Ukraine’s sovereignty and what it calls Russia’s “security concerns”. The confusion is reflected in its media and public statements. Hu is among a number of significant Chinese voices to challenge the official line. Wang Huiyao, the president of the Beijing-based thinktank the Center for China and Globalization, argued in the New York Times that western alliances would grow stronger and closer as the war dragged on. “That is not good for China,” he said, calling for the west to bring Beijing on as a mediator and “offer the Russian leader an offramp”, which in turn could repair China’s international standing. The messaging from China’s leadership and state media has largely presented the government as a neutral peacemaker, but blaming the US and Nato for the conflict and not criticising Russia and Putin – a key ally with whom Xi Jinping signed a “limitless” partnership shortly before the invasion. There is an apparent effort by Chinese state media to report the facts of casualties and attacks neutrally, and directives have reportedly been issued to avoid particular stances for or against Russia and Ukraine. The dominant angle is anti-western, and government mouthpiece editorials have accused the US of fake news over claims that China may give Russia weapons. But observers have noted the evening news has avoided depicting Ukrainian victims or damage which might engender sympathy, and is still not referring to it as an “invasion”. Reports and officials have also amplified Russian disinformation and propaganda, including conspiracy theories that the US is funding chemical weapon-producing biolabs in Ukraine, or fake polling that Ukrainians support the invasion, according to the Taiwan-based media analyst Doublethink Labs. Foreign-facing English-language media appears to be more inclined to report on Russian atrocities and refer to it as a “war”, signalling an awareness that its position on Russia is not being well received, but this too is contradicted by the disinformation and rhetoric coming from foreign officials. “English-language publications – such as CGTN – are directed at foreigners, and operate according to an entirely different propaganda script,” says Prof Carl Minzner, a China scholar and professor of law at Fordham law school. “But since those aren’t directed at Chinese citizens, they aren’t a good measure for evaluating how Beijing seeks to depict the conflict for its home audience.” In non-official media and social media, pro-Russian rhetoric is much more common. The pro-Russian discourse among Chinese internet users aligns with – or perhaps was born of – the strong anti-US sentiment which has fostered in recent years, says Liu. “It is dangerously negative,” says Liu, and impossible to quantify. “Thats why Hu’s voice is important,” says Liu. “We don’t know the percentage of who he’s representing but it’s an important dissenting voice.” There is huge interest in the conflict and news stories are trending with hundreds of millions of views and tens of thousands of comments. Dissenting voices are there, mostly concerned about the impact on civilians. But they are few and far between, and subject to censorship. On Friday Wang Jixian, a Chinese national in Odesa, posted two new video diaries to YouTube – a site banned in China – in which he railed against Putin, calling him a “coward” and “villain”, as well as against Putin’s supporters, and the Chinese authorities for shutting down debate. Wang, whose videos have amassed hundreds of thousands of views, said much of his content had been “cancelled” and he had been blocked from sending messages on WeChat and from contacting his parents, who are still in China. He asked people to tell them he was still alive. “Why are you pressuring my parents? Your power is bestowed to you by your people, with your guns and bombs, are these for you to fire at your own people? Do you like oppression that much? Come on, fire at your own citizen!” he said. “Making up lies is the only technique and language you have, right? I know I am gonna see more rumours about me, but do you think I really care?” Wang’s videos have drawn vitriol on the Chinese internet, including accusations of being a friend of separatists, a China-slanderer, a US-worshipper, and an embarrassment to Beijingers. “Taking advantage of both sides, refined egoism, bah, disgusting,” said one. Liu hopes Hu, who is still in China, is not punished for his essay. “For scholars to express their own opinions, and [to] allow people to debate, is very important trait of any great power,” he says. “China says it’s a great power and any great power should have the self-confidence to allow healthy, vibrant discussion.”",News/World news,Chinese article urging country to cut ties with Putin gets 1m views,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/chinese-article-urging-country-to-cut-ties-with-putin-gets-1m-views
