3/29/2022,"The deputy mayor of Mariupol, Sergiy Orlov, describes people sheltering in basements trying to survive without food, medicine or a power supply, and drinking melted snow because the water has been cut off. In Chernihiv, March 16, a line of 10 civilians queuing for bread outside a grocery shop were killed by Russian troops. Ukrainian intelligence reports indiscriminate shelling and targeting of agricultural machinery, fields and grain stores; and civilians are being blocked from leaving besieged towns and cities or killed whilst fleeing. This is a playbook familiar to any monitoring similar starvation crimes in Syria, Yemen, Tigray or South Sudan. A few very elderly Ukrainians will remember the forced starvation of the Holodomor of 1932-33, when a combination of brutally enforced collectivization and punitive confiscation of food killed about three million Ukrainians through the resulting famine. It was the occasion for Stalin’s infamous remark ‘if only one man dies of hunger, that is a tragedy; if millions die, that’s only statistics.’ He was wrong: every Ukrainian knows the story, deeply carved into their collective memory. After Ukrainian independence, monuments to the victims of famine were constructed in Kiev and Kharkhiv. It was another starvation crime that Volodymyr Zelenskiy chose to invoke when appealing to the Russians last week [16 March]. He said, ‘Citizens of Russia, how is your blockade of Mariupol different from the blockade of Leningrad during World War Two?’ During the 900-day siege of Leningrad, a million people perished of starvation and cold. Less well known is that a similar number died in Ukraine at the same time, victims of the aptly named German Hungerplan. Famine of this scale isn’t in prospect today. Scores of people have died from lack of medical care over the last three weeks and there are increasing reports of individuals perishing from thirst and suffering extreme hunger and cold. The absence—to date—of mass death from hunger doesn’t mean that the Russian forces are innocent of the war crime of starvation. The crime is defined in Article 8(2)(b)(xxv) of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court as: ‘Intentionally using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare by depriving them of objects indispensable to their survival, including wilfully impeding relief supplies as provided for under the Geneva Conventions.’ Each element of the crime is engaged in Ukraine today. First, it is intentional. The Russian commanders are waging war in such a way that, in the normal course of events, people will starve. That’s enough—the soldiers don’t need to have a blueprint for famine to be guilty of the crime. Second, they’re attacking civilians. The lawfulness of siege tactics can be debated, but it there is no grey area when it comes to civilians: they must never become the targets of attack. Third, it’s a war. Despite Vladimir Putin calling it a ‘special military operation’ it meets any objective definition of an international armed conflict. The International Court of Justice made this clear when it issued a provisional order to Russia to suspend its military operations on March 15. Four, the Russians are depriving Ukrainians of objects indispensable to survival. In law, starvation goes beyond our everyday understanding of extreme lack of food. It is the denial of anything that is necessary for life, such as farms, cattle, drinking water, irrigation works, medical supplies, means of shelter, and fuel and electricity. The UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator has described the damage in Ukraine which is leaving ‘civilians without the basics for day-to-day life.’ And lastly, there are also reports of humanitarian aid convoys being blocked from accessing Mariupol or looted on their way in, and efforts to evacuate civilians from the city being blocked. The Ukrainian Prosecutors General’s Office and civil society organisations have been documenting war crimes in Ukraine since 2014, supported by Global Rights Compliance, a foundation based in The Hague. The evidence base for starvation crimes is accumulating daily, alongside other war crimes. It’s notoriously hard to apprehend war criminals and bring them to court. And in those cases where there have been prosecutions—such as Cambodia and Former Yugoslavia—no one has been charged with starvation crimes. Just four years ago, the Russian representative at the UN Security Council cast his vote in support of resolution 2417, on the topic of ‘armed conflict and hunger.’ The resolution affirms that ‘using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare may constitute a war crime.’ Despite the ever-increasing use of hunger as a weapon of war in conflicts around the world, the UN has yet to utilize its authority to call out the culprits. Whether in Ethiopia, Myanmar, Syria or Yemen, hunger is inflicted with impunity. It’s time for our tacit tolerance of weaponized starvation to end. The evidence is in our faces; the law is in our hands; what is lacking is public clamour and political leadership. Starvation crimes should be put in their rightful place at the head of the list of acts of inhumanity so reprehensible that they are prohibited without question. Ukrainians should not be condemned to starve for the third time in a hundred years.

3/29/2022,"In a speech delivered last Friday from his office in the Kremlin, Putin criticized the west’s “cancel culture”, which, he charged, is “canceling” Russia – “an entire thousand-year-old country, our people”. It was the third time in recent months Putin has blasted the so-called “cancel culture”. Which is exactly what Trump, Tucker Carlson, and the Republican party have blasted for several years. “The goal of cancel culture is to make decent Americans live in fear of being fired, expelled, shamed, humiliated and driven from society as we know it,” Trump said as he accepted his party’s nomination at the Republican National Convention in 2020. Tucker Carlson, one of Fox News’s most prominent personalities, has charged that liberals have been trying to cancel everything from Space Jam to the Fourth of July. Putin’s fixation on transgender and gay people has also been echoed on the American right. Republican state bills aimed at limiting LGBTQ rights or discussion in schools are soaring. Last fall – months before Texas’s Republican governor Greg Abbott threatened to criminalize parents who give their transgender children gender-affirming care – Putin argued that teaching children about different gender identities was “on the verge of a crime against humanity”. Then there’s admiration for Putin himself. Just before Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Trump deemed him “savvy”, “genius”, and “smart” for “taking over a country, literally, a vast, vast, location, a great piece of land with a lot of people, and just walking right in”. On his Fox News program, Carlson asked, rhetorically: “Why do I hate Putin so much? Has Putin ever called me a racist? Has he threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him?” But Carlson called Ukraine “an obedient puppet of the Biden state department” and suggests Putin’s invasion was nothing more than a “border dispute”. Putin’s lies and the lies coming from America’s extreme right are mutually reenforcing. Carlson’s Fox News segments show up in Russian propaganda. And when the American site “Infowars” resurrected an unfounded Russian claim that the United States funded biological weapons labs in Ukraine, Putin repeated the Infowars story. To conclude from all of this that authoritarians think alike is to miss a deeper truth. Putin, Trump, Carlson, and a growing number of rightwing commentators and activists, have been promoting much the same narrative – for much the same reason. Remember, Putin was put into power by a Russian oligarchy made fabulously rich by siphoning off the wealth of the former Soviet Union. Likewise, Trump and the radical right in America have been bankrolled by an American oligarchy – Rupert Murdoch, Charles Koch, Rebekah Mercer (daughter of hedge fund tycoon Robert Mercer), Blackstone chief executive Stephen Schwarzman, and other billionaires. What do these two sets of oligarchs get in return? Strongmen who divert the public’s attention away from the oligarchs’ hijacking of their economies toward cultural fears of being overwhelmed by the “other.” Putin’s MO has been to fuel Russian ethnic pride and nationalism. The Trump-Carlson-radical right’s MO has been to fuel white American nationalism. In both cases, strongmen and their allies have mythologized a “superior” culture (replete with creation stories of blood ties, motherlands, and religion) supposedly endangered by decadent forces intent on attacking and overwhelming it. To Putin, the decadent force is the west. As he put it Friday, “domestic culture at all times protected the identity of Russia”, which “accepted all the best and creative, but rejected the deceitful and fleeting, that which destroyed continuity of our spiritual values, moral principles and historical memory”. Hence, a mythic justification for taking Ukraine back from a seductive but inferior western culture that threatens to overwhelm it and Russia. The Trump-Carlson-white nationalist narrative is similar: America’s dominant white Christian culture is endangered by Black people, immigrants and coastal elites who threaten to overwhelm it. The culture wars now being orchestrated by the Republican party against transgender people, gay people, poor women seeking abortions, and schools that teach about sex and America’s history of racism, emerge from the same narrative as Putin’s culture war against a “decadent” West filled with “sociocultural disturbances.” As does the right’s claim that “secularists” have, in the words of former Trump attorney general William Barr, mounted “an unremitting assault on religion and traditional values”. These tropes have served to distract attention from the systemic economic looting that oligarchs have been undertaking, leaving most people poor and anxious. Which is why the grievances that Putin, Trump, Carlson, and the Republican party use are unremittingly cultural; they are never economic, never about class, and most assuredly not about the predations of the super-rich. Reduced to basics, today’s oligarchs and strongmen (along with their mouthpieces and lackeys) are trying to justify their wealth and power by attacking liberal values that have shaped the west, beginning with the enlightenment of the 17th and 18th centuries – the values of tolerance, openness, democracy, self-government, equal rights, and the rule of law. These values are incompatible with a society of oligarchs and strongmen. Ultimately, the oligarchs and strongmen will lose. Putin won’t succeed in subduing Ukraine, Trump won’t be re-elected president, and Carlson and his ilk won’t persuade Americans to give up on American ideals. But the culture wars won’t end any time soon, because so much wealth and power have consolidated at the top of America, Russia, and elsewhere around the world that anti-liberal forces have risen to justify it.

3/29/2022,"Seven years ago, an anonymous source who went by the name “John Doe” provided us with the data that became the Panama Papers – 2.6 terabytes of leaked documents from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca. The leak turned out to have quite an impressive Russian component. We found shell companies connected to Vladimir Putin’s judo friends, Boris and Arkady Rotenberg, to the oligarch Alisher Usmanov and the wife of the Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. But, most significantly, we stumbled across Sergej Roldugin, a professional cellist and godfather of Putin’s eldest daughter, who had a central role in a network of secret offshore deals and vast loans worth $2bn, described at the time as the key to tracing Putin’s hidden fortune. All this hidden wealth mattered when we published the Panama Papers in 2016, two years after Russia had annexed the Crimean peninsula. Now, after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, it matters more than ever. Lawmakers in the UK, the EU, the US and Canada have sanctioned Russian banks, Russian companies and individuals close to Putin. This includes Russian oligarchs, as well as Putin’s friends, supporters and admirers who have helped facilitate his kleptocracy by hiding his wealth in accounts under their own names or just championing his kleptocracy for their own illicit enrichment. Individuals like the cellist Sergej Roldugin, the Rotenberg brothers and Usmanov. Now, the western world has decided that they want Putin’s friends to be sanctioned for the kleptocracy and harm they have facilitated and from which they have benefited. Prosecutors and investigators as well as special police units are now hunting for the riches of Putin’s friends. They are seizing yachts, grounding planes and confiscating lavish villas. Yet what they will find is probably only the tip of the iceberg. To really hit Putin and his friends where it hurts, one must go to Switzerland, to Panama, Cyprus and the British Virgin Islands. Unfortunately, investigators will probably not get much help there – as secrecy is what those countries sell.Economists like to call them tax havens or secrecy jurisdictions. But “black holes” would be more appropriate for these places where greedy lawyers, tax advisers, consultants and other crooks help the rich and powerful to hide or, as they put it, “fence” their assets. These willing helpers assist the oligarchs to make their fortunes vanish from the view of law enforcement.When we received the leak that became the Panama Papers, we found – apart from Roldugin – dozens of filthy rich Russians. When we received the Paradise Papers, another offshore data leak, the names of oligarchs Roman Abramovich, Alisher Usmanov and Oleg Deripaska appeared in the data, as did Olga Shuvalova, the wife of Russia’s first deputy prime minister. More than a year ago we got hold of the Suisse Secrets, yet another leak, and there was the sister of Alisher Usmanov and a fortune of aboutr 2bn Swiss francs. Sanctions are a powerful tool in foreign policy. Some even call it a “tool of modern war”. We understand the idea to put pressure on Putin’s inner circle and Russia’s economy. But why stop there? Let’s address the problem and not only its symptoms. Let’s change the system so governments do not have to rely on sanctions to prevent Putin and other kleptocracies from gaining more power. First and foremost, secrecy jurisdictions themselves need to be targeted. It is not enough to go after the profiteers of these countries, but the jurisdictions themselves. If necessary, the black holes themselves need to be sanctioned – to bring change not only to the war in Ukraine, but worldwide. Russia’s oligarchs are not the only ones who enjoy a luxury lifestyle financed with stolen money. Kleptocracy and corruption are far from a uniquely Russian phenomenon. Think Venezuela. Think China. Think Angola. Addressing the systemic causes of kleptocracy and corruption will inevitably mean targeting both the legal structures and professionals in the west that facilitate kleptocracy: law firms, consultants and asset managers in Zurich, London and New York who regularly lend a helping hand to kleptocrats. They profit from jurisdictions like the Cayman islands and Switzerland – and yes, the US – which still offer secrecy on a grand scale. They profit from jurisdictions without public registries of who owns real estate and companies. Defenders of secrecy claim their rights to privacy matter most. But let us face the facts: financial secrecy is the engine of global corruption and kleptocracy. It makes it too easy for corrupt elites to plunder whole continents, for traffickers of drugs and people to launder their money, and it helps to finance brutal wars. It helps Putin and his friends. Fortunately, in late 2020, the United States government finally passed legislation that requires a beneficial ownership registry for US companies. Similar registries exist in dozens of countries, because forcing companies to reveal who ultimately benefits from them makes it far more difficult for kleptocrats and their cronies to hide their illicit money. But the US legislation, the Corporate Transparency Act, does not go far enough. It forces the ultimate beneficial owners to be revealed only to the authorities and only under certain circumstances. But not to the public. And this is a huge mistake. As long as we rely on authorities and law enforcement alone, kleptocrats, autocrats and Putin’s friends will have an easier time evading sanctions and continuing to hide their ill-gotten gains. Mutual legal assistance between national law enforcement agencies takes years, and does not penetrate the numerous layers of secrecy used by evildoers around the globe. Journalists and civil society groups have proven to be far more effective. They can collaborate quickly and effectively across borders, they can work with leaked data (something law enforcement still has to learn) and connect it with publicly available data. New government task forces set up late in the day to chase Putin’s cronies’ cash will be insufficient. Governments should open up the registries: company registries, ship registries, plane registries, real estate registries. Give the investigative power to the people – and we bet: you will not be disappointed. Above all, let’s finally get rid of those black holes.

3/29/2022,"At a time when the strains of Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau (Land of my Fathers) echoing across the Irish Sea from Cardiff have stoked envy among Republic of Ireland fans who have had comparatively little to be enthused about in recent years, the pin-prick sign of what looks suspiciously like a light at the end of a long and dark tunnel has been spotted. Last Saturday Ireland came from behind twice to hold Belgium to a draw in a packed Aviva Stadium and for the first time since the pre-Covid era fans left the south Dublin ground surfing a wave of what looked like cautious optimism. Of course there are caveats; while much was made of Ireland’s draw against the top-ranked team in the world, it behoves us to point out it was only a friendly and the visitors fielded an experimental side without most of their box-office names. But as the hoary old saw goes, you can only play the team in front of you, and after an inauspicious run of 11 games without a win that followed the appointment of Stephen Kenny as manager during lockdown in 2020, Ireland are unbeaten in seven and have clearly come a long way since the embarrassment of losing a World Cup qualifier at home to Luxembourg almost a year ago to the day. On Tuesday night Ireland host Lithuania in another friendly and all eyes will be on Chiedozie Ogbene, a most unlikely saviour who plays for the League One side Rotherham United. Utilised as a wing-back for the third-tier leaders, the 24-year-old plays further forward for Ireland, made his debut against Hungary last summer and headed the first of three goals he has scored in six appearances for his country against Azerbaijan last October. Against Belgium Ogbene emphatically announced himself to the Irish public, teeing himself up for an audacious overhead kick to score the team’s first in a busy penalty area before showing commendable tenacity to keep the ball in play and provide the cross from which Alan Browne nodded past Simon Mignolet to score the late equaliser. From Cork, via Lagos, the Nigerian city from which his family relocated when he was eight years old, Ogbene grew up playing gaelic football for Nemo Rangers and “soccer” for a variety of Munster Senior League clubs before signing for Cork City. Now established at Rotherham after spells at Limerick, Brentford and Exeter City, the first Africa-born player to represent the Republic of Ireland football team is a firm favourite among fans slowly but surely falling back in love with a football team that, for all their remaining flaws and poverty of elite personnel, finally seem to be on the right track. In Kenny, Irish fans are beginning to trust. Originally viewed as the cheap option after the departing Football Association of Ireland chief executive John Delaney left behind a financial mess, the appointment of Kenny as Mick McCarthy’s replacement could scarcely have been more underwhelming. There was a succession plan for him to take over from McCarthy but Covid cancellations meant he was parachuted in earlier than expected after a successful stint in charge of Ireland’s Under-21s. With a managerial background in the League of Ireland, apart from one season at Dunfermline, Kenny lacked the celebrity cachet and credentials of foreign alternatives the FAI could not afford. Although he talked a good game – the promotion of youth, energetic pressing, playing from the back and taking the contest to opponents – his was a process that was always going to take time to implement. He was not helped by a shocking, often luckless start that had many detractors calling for his head even before the humiliation against Luxembourg. After the draw with Belgium, Kenny called for perspective when an interviewer harked back to those dark days. “When I took over, we played a [Euro 2020] play-off against Slovakia and we were outstanding out there, dominating possession before losing on penalties,” he told Sky Sports. “For the next two camps, we were minus 10 players on both occasions for Covid-related reasons, so that is tough to carry. Now we have put 15 players in the squad over the last year that have come through our own system in Ireland, that we have nourished, and all of a sudden we have a squad and competition for places. We need to improve again but we have shown against Portugal and Serbia, as well as in this game against Belgium, that we have quality and a togetherness.” Kenny has lost only one of his past 11 games, a heartbreaking late defeat snatched from the jaws of victory against Portugal in a World Cup qualifier, and this month signed a contract extension to include the upcoming Uefa Nations League and Euro 2024 campaigns. The first of these competitive matches is scheduled for early June. Although it would be premature to state the Republic of Ireland’s football future is bright, the assimilation into the squad of players such as Ogbene, one of several youngsters vying to rub shoulders with more established regulars, means it is by no means as bleak as it seemed this time last year.",Sport/Football,Republic of Ireland offer cause for optimism one year after humiliation ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/29/republic-of-ireland-cause-for-optimism-stephen-kenny
3/29/2022,"P&O Ferries has rejected the government’s call to move this week’s deadline for the 800 sacked workers to accept redundancy offers, saying most had already signed contracts and ministers were “ignoring the situation’s fundamental and factual realities”. In a bullish response to transport secretary Grant Shapps, the ferry operator’s chief executive, Peter Hebblethwaite, said the demand was legally impossible and would close the firm down. He wrote to Shapps: “Complying with your request would deliberately cause the company’s collapse, resulting in the irretrievable loss of an additional 2,200 jobs. I cannot imagine that you would wish to compel an employer to bring about its downfall, affecting not hundreds but thousands of families.” Hebblethwaite said that more than 765 of the 786 crew members summarily sacked on 17 March had “taken steps to accept the settlement offer”, and more than 500 had signed legally binding agreements. That included 67 officers who were planning to continue to work on P&O’s vessels with the new agency crew. Shapps had written to P&O Ferries on Monday offering “one last opportunity” to U-turn on its extraordinary and illegal sacking of the UK-based crew, working on Jersey contracts, before bringing in a planned package of legal measures to force its hand. The transport secretary is expected to unveil an eight-point plan to parliament on Wednesday that will include tightening employment laws for ship operators in UK waters, and tackling minimum pay. Hebblethwaite wrote that the firm welcomed proposals to increase the minimum wage for all seafarers in UK waters, adding: “From the outset, P&O Ferries has called for a level playing field regarding salaries on British ferry routes.” What unions have called a “race to the bottom” among operators was accelerated last year after the government refused to step in when Irish Ferries started operating the Dover-Calais crossing in summer 2021, using a similar model of low-paid agency staff. Calls by unions for intervention were followed by a direct personal warning to Shapps in November last year from P&O Ferries’ Dubai-based owner, the DP World chief executive Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, that Irish Ferries’ low-cost crewing model “posed challenges” to its operations. Hebblethwaite told Shapps that regardless of the minimum wage, P&O Ferries would need to adopt a different crewing model, and not pay staff for their rest periods as currently agreed with unions. The chief executive, who shocked MPs at a Commons hearing last week by admitting his firm deliberately broke the law by dismissing the workers without consultation, said: “I have endeavoured to present the facts in this letter and before the select committees with absolute candour and transparency.” He added: “We have made this difficult decision in the knowledge that it would be highly unpopular and, for some, difficult to reconcile … I am fully cognisant of the reputational cost to the P&O Ferries brand and me personally.” Sailings currently remain suspended on passenger routes. On Monday night, a second P&O ferry, the Pride of Kent, was detained by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency after failing a safety inspection.

3/29/2022,"Good morning. Ukraine’s neutrality and the status of contested areas in the east could be on the table in ceasefire talks that began this morning in Turkey, but with Russia’s invasion largely stalled, Kyiv will make no concessions on territorial integrity, officials have said. Before the discussions, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, delivered some emphatic lines in his most recent national address regarding what he described as “passive” penalties imposed by the west on Russia, saying that Ukrainians were paying for “weak” sanctions with their lives. Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson, meanwhile, has said sanctions on trade and oligarchs are akin to “total war” against Russia, and that the west has pushed the Kremlin “into the corner” with Nato expansion. Dmitry Peskov said the sanctions levelled against Russia were “quite unfriendly” and made the country feel as if it were at war with the US and its western allies. Will the talks be a success? Both sides have played down the chances of a significant breakthrough, and a senior US official said Putin did not appear ready to compromise. What else is happening? The Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich and the Ukrainian MP Rustem Umerov experienced symptoms consistent with poisoning during talks this month. Abramovich has not let that put him off, as he has been pictured at today’s talks in Istanbul. What’s happening in Ukraine? Here’s what we know on day 34 of the Russian invasion. The House select committee investigating the Capitol attack voted yesterday to recommend the criminal prosecution of two of Donald Trump’s top former White House aides, Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino, for defying subpoenas in a bid to undermine the January 6 inquiry. The select committee unanimously approved the contempt of Congress report it had been examining. The citations now head for a vote before the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, which is expected to approve resolutions for referrals to the justice department. Congressman Bennie Thompson, the chair of the select committee, said the panel was seeking the criminal prosecution for Navarro and Scavino to punish their non-cooperation over claims of executive privilege it did not recognize. “Executive privilege doesn’t belong to just any White House official. It belongs to the president. Here, President Biden has been clear that executive privilege does not prevent cooperation with the Select Committee by either Mr Scavino or Mr Navarro,” Thompson said. What about Ginni Thomas? The select committee was expected to huddle to discuss whether to demand that Ginni Thomas, the wife of the supreme court justice Clarence Thomas, assist the investigation. What did Congressman Jamie Raskin say? “This is America, and there’s no executive privilege here for presidents, much less trained advisors, to plan coups and organize insurrections.” When Senator Joe Manchin announced in December that he would not support the Build Back Better Act, House progressives immediately got to work, writes Joan E Greve. As the Congressional Progressive Caucus continued to lobby for passing a social spending package, its members also started crafting a list of potential executive orders that Biden could sign to advance the Democrats’ policy agenda. That list was released in mid-March after months of deliberations, and it outlines a specific strategy for Biden to combat the climate crisis and lower costs for American families with the flick of his pen. The suggestions from the CPC demonstrate the increasing pressure that Biden faces from progressive Democrats to take more decisive action before the midterm elections in November, where many in his party fear they could get badly beaten. Progressives warn that, if Biden does not start signing more executive orders, Democrats’ failure to follow through on many of their campaign promises will result in severely depressed voter turnout among their supporters in November, probably allowing Republicans to regain control of the House and the Senate. What’s on the CPC’s list of possible orders? The list addresses everything from the climate crisis to immigration reform and healthcare costs, covering a broad array of issues that affect a large swath of the Democratic coalition.

3/29/2022,"The government will provide $6.7m in 2022-23 to support the investigation and prosecution of potential war crimes in Afghanistan by the Office of the Special Investigator. The funds follow the report by Justice Paul Brereton which recommended charges against serving and past members of the Australian Defence Force, including members of the elite SAS. Funding includes $3.9m to the attorney general’s department to advise the Office of the Special Investigator on matters of international law, obtain legal assistance from foreign jurisdictions and to protect sensitive national security information in potential criminal proceedings.

An incentive program which involves refunding visa fees for international students who arrive by 19 March, and working holidaymakers who arrive by 19 April, will cost the budget money, but those arriving will pay tax and relieve the staff shortages in hospitality. The government is also increasing country caps for work and holiday visas by 30% in 2022-23, to allow in 11,000 backpackers. Tax changes have been foreshadowed for workers under the Australian agriculture visa scheme, with the government saying it will “clarify” the tax treatment soon “to respond to workforce shortages in the agriculture and primary industry sectors”. Sounds like an election announcement in a pumpkin field in far north Queensland is on the cards. The measures will increase receipts by an estimated $115m and cost $16m over the forward estimates. The government will provide $20.3m over three years from 2021-22 to plant trees for the Queen’s platinum jubilee. The funding was announced on 6 February and provides grants across Australia for community-led tree planting projects. The government will provide $4.1m in 2022-23 to implement the recommendations of the independent review into commonwealth parliamentary workplaces, which followed the allegations raised by Brittany Higgins and others. This includes $2.6m for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to design and establish an Office of Parliamentarian Staffing and Culture (OPSC) and undertake preparatory work to establish an Independent Parliamentary Standards Commission. A further $800,000 has been allocated to establish a shopfront for the OPSC at Parliament House and undertake a feasibility study into establishing a parliamentary health and wellbeing service. The government will provide $29.7m over four years and $800,000 a year ongoing to buy and maintain security assets at Parliament House, including improvements to the CCTV network, upgraded screening equipment and an expanded parliamentary security operations room. The government has extended funding for two years to the ATO’s tax avoidance task force targeting multinationals, large public and private companies, trusts and high wealth individuals. That’s mainly chasing down schemes that use offshore tax havens and income transfer schemes to avoid paying tax in Australia. The extension of the task force will cost an additional $652.5m over two years but the budget papers reveal this measure “is estimated to increase receipts by $2.1bn”. Sounds like a no brainer. Data system changes can be very slow, it seems. The government will defer for a year the start date of a measure announced in the 2019-20 budget to strengthen the Australian Business Number system, which is aimed at curbing the black economy. The cost of the deferral is said to be small: $5m. The government announced funding for the ABC and SBS in February. It locked in $3.3bn in funding for the ABC from July 2022 to June 2025, an increase of $87.2m over the current triennial funding period, thanks to the restoration of indexing and continuation of its enhanced newsgathering program that provides news services to the regions. The SBS will receive $953.7m over the same period. The government has granted or extended access to refunds of indirect tax (that’s GST, fuel and alcohol taxes) to the embassies and consulates of Fiji, India, Indonesia, Latvia, Malaysia, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office, the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, Tonga, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, the UK and Vanuatu. The government has also extended access to the indirect tax concessions for Papua New Guinea and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office to include construction and renovation relating to their current and future diplomatic missions and consular posts. The cost? $6.9m to the budget and a further $6.4m out of the pool of GST payable to the states and territories over the forward estimates. The veterans’ affairs and defence personnel minister, Andrew Gee, declared he would quit cabinet if money to deal with the backlog of veterans’ compensation claims was not secured. The Department of Defence release which arrived a little late in the lockup shows he has had a five minutes-to-midnight victory. “An initial $22.8m will fund 90 extra Department of Veterans’ Affairs staff to cut the backlog of unprocessed claims, and this will be followed by a further $73.2m for additional staff and other measures to further improve the veteran claims processing system and reduce waiting times,” it said. The budget itself only includes the initial $22.8m over two years from 2022-23. The follow-up money is more of a public pledge by the government than a budgeted line item.",News/Australia news,Australia’s 2022 federal budget: what we found in the fine print,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/29/australias-2022-federal-budget-what-we-found-in-the-fine-print
3/29/2022,"Several people have been injured and more are feared dead or kidnapped after gunmen attacked passengers on a train travelling between Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, and the northern city of Kaduna, entering carriages and opening fire before soldiers arrived at the scene. The incident began just before 9.00pm on Monday, according to witnesses, when assailants reportedly detonated explosives to halt the train shortly before it reached Kaduna. Authorities have not yet confirmed the attack, which looks like the most significant on the railway line from the capital since it began operating in 2016. According to local media reports, about 1,000 passengers were on board. Many Nigerians use the railway as a safer alternative to the road route between the two cities, which for years has been one of the most dangerous in the country due to kidnappings and attacks by armed groups known as bandits. The incident comes just two days after gunmen attacked Kaduna airport, killing a security guard before soldiers intervened. Details of the latest incident emerged on Monday night when passengers described being shot at on social media. Some complained that the attack continued for an hour before soldiers eventually arrived to rescue them. Unverified video footage posted to social media showed passengers with bullet wounds and damaged carriages. I'm in the train . I have been shot please pray for me. Local media said at least one person was killed. A senator in Kaduna, Shehu Sani, said passengers and police reported that many people had been shot and killed. “Police officers confirmed that three train cleaners were killed. My friend’s wife, who was on the train, also said many people in her carriage were killed and injured and many kidnapped and taken away into the bush,” he said. “I got distress calls from some of the passengers. Even from the call you can hear the gunshots.” Nigeria’s train operator, the National Railway Corporation, said on Tuesday morning: “Due to unforeseen circumstances train operations along the Abuja-Kaduna route has been temporarily suspended. Further communication would be given in due course.” Dear passengers, due to unforeseen circumstances, Train operations along the Abuja-Kaduna route has been temporarily suspended. Further Communication would be given in due course. Government authorities have yet to release a statement. However, relatives told local media several people had been taken to hospital after the attack. Much of north-west and central Nigeria has been in the grip of relentless attacks by so-called bandit groups, proscribed terrorists in Nigeria who have waged mass killings mainly in villages, rural towns and motorways. The groups – mostly ethnic Fulanis – have carried out thousands of abductions, killings, thefts and acts of sexual violence. They emerged from a historical conflict that has worsened dramatically, between largely Fulani pastoralists and farmers of varying ethnic groups, over access to water and land and the boundaries between private farmland and grazing areas. In recent years, the groups have overwhelmed communities and been more heavily armed than local police forces and vigilante groups. Airstrikes have been launched on their hideouts in a forested expanse stretching from northern Nigeria into Niger but the attacks have continued.",News/World news,Many feared dead after gunmen attack passenger train in Nigeria,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/29/injured-gunmen-attack-passenger-train-nigeria-abuja-kaduna
3/29/2022,"Parts of a fire that broke out on Monday at a gigantic landfill site on the outskirts of Delhi known as the “mountain of shame” were still smouldering 24 hours later, choking local residents who have complained of breathing in toxic fumes. Dozens of firefighters struggled to douse the flames at the landfill site in Ghazipur, due to its height and a lack of access roads. The precise cause of the fire has not been established but Monday was the hottest day in India’s capital so far this year and experts said the heat could have increased the amount of methane generated by decomposing waste. Once methane crosses a certain limit, a fire is ignited. “My son was the first to start itching his eyes and coughing,” said Shyam Biswas, who sells flowers in the local wholesale market. “Then my father began and when we went out on the balcony we saw the sky filled with black smoke.” As the landfill comes into view from the highway that passes through Ghazipur, it looks like an eerie mountain range with vultures circling above. Packed with the rubbish of Delhi’s 20 million residents, the site has grown since it was set up in 1994 to cover 80 acres and reach a height of 65 metres. It exceeded its capacity more than a decade ago but 2,500 tonnes of waste continue to be dumped on it every day. Like other Indian cities, Delhi has no system of waste disposal and treatment other than dumping it in landfills. A study in 2020 by the Centre for Science and Environment found more than 3,000 mountainous landfills across India containing 800m tonnes of rubbish. The country’s tallest mountain of rubbish – in Mumbai – is estimated to be 18 storeys high. The Ghazipur landfill is a constant health hazard. Last year, fires broke out four times. In 2017, a large part of it loosened and broke away, crashing on to the road and killing two people. For people living in the areas surrounding it, the air is always toxic. The decomposing waste releases noxious gases, exacerbating the already heavily polluted air. A World Air Quality report last week found that Delhi was the world’s most polluted capital city in 2021 for the fourth consecutive year. “The problem is that it is mixed waste that has not been segregated so the fire will have released all manner of toxins – sulphur dioxide, carbon soot, nitrogen, and particulate matter into the air, making the air far worse than usual,” said Richa Singh, from the Centre for Science and Environment. By noon on Tuesday, 24 hours later, the fire was still smouldering. The local government in Delhi is working on flattening the landfill, a sisyphean task given that rubbish continues to be dumped there every day.",News/World news,Toxic fumes fill Delhi’s skies after vast landfill site catches fire ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/29/delhi-landfill-fire-toxic-fumes
3/29/2022,"The UK government is aiming to triple the number of solar panels, more than quadruple offshore wind power and double onshore wind and nuclear energy by 2030, in a move that could lower bills for consumers and reduce the UK’s reliance on foreign energy suppliers such as Russia. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business minister, has put forward the targets as part of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy’s plans for inclusion in the upcoming energy security white paper. The paper has faced delays because the cost of approving at least six nuclear power stations as part of an expansion of the UK’s renewable energy strategy has been debated at the Treasury. BEIS’s targets include increasing solar power from its current capacity of 14GW to 50GW, offshore wind from 11GW to 50GW, onshore wind from 15GW to 30GW, and nuclear power from 7GW to 16GW, according to the Financial Times. Solar power and onshore wind generation have, to date, not had official government growth targets. Earlier this month, Kwarteng said that developing the UK’s energy independence was a matter of national security. This is no longer about tackling climate change or reaching Net Zero targets.Ensuring the UK’s clean energy independence is a matter of national security.Putin can set the price of gas, but he can’t directly control the price of renewables and nuclear we generate in the UK. pic.twitter.com/1WNLnBV7q5 Boris Johnson has set out a 10-point plan that includes a target for the UK to get all of its electricity from low-carbon sources by 2035. The expansion of wind and solar farms is likely to be opposed by some local residents and campaign groups. Johnson, who has said that his personal preference is to expand offshore wind power generation, is considering plans to offer residents affected by the construction of energy farms or nuclear power plants financial incentives to win them over. On Tuesday, SSE, the electricity generator and network company, upgraded its profit forecasts after changes to weather conditions improved output from its renewable energy generation sources. The company – which raised adjusted earnings a share from guidance to between 92p and 97p, up from 90p – also said its thermal and hydro plant benefited from the disruption seen to oil and gas markets due to the war in Ukraine. “SSE’s integrated and balanced business model has performed well in turbulent market conditions,” said the SSE finance director, Gregor Alexander, who added that capital expenditure for the year to the end of March will exceed £2bn. “Our significant investment programme will make a huge contribution towards both net zero and energy security,” he said.",News/Business,UK aims to quadruple offshore wind power in renewable energy push,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/29/uk-offshore-wind-power-renewable-energy-kwasi-kwarteng
3/29/2022,"Who is he? What happened? After watching this high-concept body-swap thriller from South Korea, I’m still scratching my head. Bourne Identity-style, it begins with a man in an expensive designer suit (Yoon Kye-sang) waking up in a car crash: he’s got a gunshot wound and no memory of who he is. But the instant he claps his eyes on his reflection he knows one thing: he’s in someone else’s body. You might wonder how he can be so certain what with the memory loss; but start picking at the plot holes and the entire movie falls apart in your hands. Things get worse for our amnesiac: at noon he wakes up in another body. Then at midnight the same thing happens – again and again, every 12 hours. After one switcheroo he finds himself in the basement of a sleazy upmarket strip club in the body of a gangland boss halfway through a nasty spot of torture. All the hosts seem to be connected to the criminal underworld – and the noirish Seoul setting provides plenty of glass and mirrors for him to cop a look at his new reflections. Interestingly, Yoon plays the hosts when the amnesiac takes up residence in their bodies, while different actors portray them at other times. I wondered whether the already-confirmed Hollywood remake will stick with that casting choice. The memory-loss device in Spiritwalker feels like exactly that: a device. It’s entertaining enough, with some well-executed car chases and bone-splintering fights. But the movie doesn’t have an awful lot to say about memory or identity, and Kye-sang’s character seems weirdly untroubled by existential terror given his predicament. My first instinct after it finished was to watch it again to try to put the pieces of the puzzle together. But then again, I’m not sure that would add very much.

3/29/2022,"Back in Black was the AC/DC song that accompanied Josh Frydenberg’s first budget, when Highway to Hell would have been more apt. Of course, Frydenberg didn’t know the Covid pandemic would hit a year later. Still, touting the modest cash surpluses planned for the 2019-20 budget and the three that followed did its immediate trick – burnishing the Morrison government’s economic credentials in a way Labor couldn’t easily match. According to that budget, by 2021-22, we would be enjoying a $17.8bn cash surplus. Instead, according to Tuesday’s budget, the underlying cash deficit is a hefty $79.8bn. It could have been a lot worse, and a large part of the 2022-23 budget involves highlighting that the outlook is improving almost by the day. Over the forward estimates to 2025-26, the underlying deficits will total almost $225bn. Painful, yes, if you’re allergic to red ink, but not as bad as the $342.4bn deficit projected a year ago for the years out to 2024-25. That was the best improvement over four years in seven decades, albeit from a low point. A key reason is that the government has ended up needing to spend less than it feared in May 2021, in part because the jobless rate has shrunk much quicker than even the most optimistic forecasts, cutting welfare payments. Still, a year ago, the government was predicting payments would total $588.7bn, when they will come in at $636.4bn, according to Tuesday’s budget. The bulge in expenditure was contained in part by the extra outlays needed to keep the economy powering through the Delta and then Omicron Covid variants. “These outcomes have been underpinned by the government’s $31bn in direct economic support, including JobKeeper, which assisted around four million individuals and 1m businesses,” the budget papers state. Thankfully for the government, revenue surpassed expectations by even more than spending overshot. A year ago the government was forecasting receipts to total $482.1bn, but in the budget the receipts came in more than $70bn better than expected at $556.6bn. Reaping more income tax by having more people in jobs helped, but so did soaring commodity prices. Treasury had tipped an iron ore price closer to US$50 a tonne than the roughly US$150 it is now trading at, and it has been even higher during the year. “Metallurgical and thermal coal spot prices have recently reached highs that are 62% and 53% above previous peaks,” the papers note. “Key commodity prices are assumed to decline from current elevated levels by the end of the September quarter 2022. The iron ore spot price is assumed to decline from US$134/tonne to US$55/tonne.” The metallurgical coal spot price is “assumed” to decline from US$512/tonne to US$130/tonne, while thermal coal’s spot price will drop from US$320/tonne to US$60/tonne. To the extent that those forecasts are too pessimistic from Australian miners’ point of view, future budgets will get a boost. The projection of debt is also a beneficiary of the improving budget outlook. Australia is good at digging holes, and the debt hole will keep growing deeper, but at a slower pace – and if the economy keeps growing it should sink slowly as a proportion of GDP. At the end of this financial year, net debt – the gross sum minus the debt owed to the Australian government – will reach $631.5bn. By June 2023 it will be at $714.9bn and a year later $772.1bn. By contrast, a year ago, the budget was projecting we would be approaching $729bn by this June, $835bn by June 2023 and $920.4bn by June 2024.",News/Australia news,How it started and how it’s going: Australia’s 2022 budget suggests black will never be back,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/29/how-it-started-and-how-its-going-australias-2022-budget-suggests-black-will-never-be-back
3/29/2022,"The Morrison government has finally bowed to pressure to offer Afghan nationals fleeing the Taliban extra humanitarian places on top of the existing global intake. The government’s previous offers to help Afghan nationals have been within the overall humanitarian program, which is capped at 13,750 a year. That stance attracted criticism from refugee advocates and religious groups which said Australia had an obligation to do more given its 20-year military engagement in Afghanistan prior to the withdrawal last year. In Tuesday evening’s budget, the government announced it would allocate an additional 16,500 humanitarian places for Afghan nationals over the next four years – 4,125 each year. Officials confirmed these were on top of the 13,750 “ceiling” for the annual humanitarian program. The supplementary places are from the 2022-23 financial year. The immigration minister, Alex Hawke, said the move was “in recognition of our sustained commitment following Australia’s two decades of operations in Afghanistan”. “In conjunction with previous announcements, this brings the total number of places available to Afghans across Australia’s Humanitarian and Migration Programs to 31,500 over the next four program years,” he said. That total includes 10,000 places that had already been pledged within the existing humanitarian program over four years and the 5,000 previously announced places in the permanent stream, such as for family members. In essence the new announcement means Afghan nationals will gain places both within the global intake and in addition to it. Advocates who had been calling on the government to do more had cited the example set by Tony Abbott in 2015 when the then prime minister announced 12,000 places for Syrian and Iraqi refugees would be in addition to the existing global intake. Refugee groups had been calling for a 20,000-strong special intake for Afghan nationals. Anglican bishops and archbishops renewed that call in a letter to the prime minister, Scott Morrison, this month. The Australian Christian Lobby – which is in regular contact with the government – had also been pressing the Coalition to do more. The budget documents say the government is allocating $666m over four years for the additional 16,500 humanitarian places for Afghan nationals. In another sign of the continuing fallout from the war in Afghanistan, the government has earmarked another $6.7m in 2022-23 to support the work of the Office of the Special Investigator (OSI) as it investigates alleged war crimes by Australian special forces. This funding includes $3.9m for the attorney general’s department to advise OSI on matters of international law, obtain legal assistance from foreign jurisdictions and to “protect sensitive national security information in potential criminal proceedings”. There is also $2.8m to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to provide legal advice to OSI, including training for investigators and brief preparation. The budget papers say the OSI funding will be offset by redirecting funding from the Department of Defence. The government’s assistance to people fleeing Russia’s war on Ukraine is being offered on a temporary basis. It flagged plans to offer a three-year Temporary Humanitarian Concern Visa (subclass 786) to Ukrainians across 2021-22 and 2022-23. Home affairs has also earmarked $9m in 2022-23 to extend existing Youth Transition Support services for 12 months “to continue the provision of services to young humanitarian entrants and vulnerable migrants”. The budget papers said this aimed to “increase engagement in education and community sport and assist in transition to employment”. As Australia seeks to move to a post-pandemic footing, the government has set a ceiling of 160,000 places for the permanent migration program in 2022-23. “The Morrison government’s migration program will focus on skilled migration, with a return to a pre-pandemic composition of roughly two-thirds/one-third across the Skill and Family streams,” Hawke said. He also announced that partner-visa processing would move to a “demand-driven model”, meaning there would be no hard cap on such places.",News/Australia news,"Federal budget to fund 16,500 more places for Afghan refugees over four years after pressure on Coalition",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/29/federal-budget-to-fund-16500-more-places-for-afghan-refugees-over-four-years-after-pressure-on-coalition
3/29/2022,"Morad Tahbaz, the British-Iranian left behind when two others were released from Iranian detention a fortnight ago, has ended a nine-day hunger strike at the pleading of his family, his daughter has said. He remains in jail in Tehran contrary to an agreement the British claimed it had struck with the Iranians. Tahbaz, a conservationist sentenced to 10 years in jail in November 2019 for being in contact with the US, has been in remission from cancer, and twice been a Covid patient. His daughter Roxanne said his family had pleaded with him to break the strike because of growing concern for his health. He ended the hunger strike on Monday. Tahbaz, 66, initially refused food in protest at being returned to jail following a confused 48 hours in which he was allowed to his family home in Tehran, then sent to a hotel before finally returning to jail. Roxanne Tahbaz, speaking on BBC Radio, said her family regretted following the UK Foreign Office’s advice to let it pursue quiet diplomacy rather than campaign for his release. The families of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori, who were released a fortnight ago, rejected official government advice to remain silent. She said: “We had been expecting to see him on the plane, but before that happened we were told this was to be an unlimited furlough and a lifting of the travel ban on my mother. Neither has come to pass. He is still in prison and she is still on a travel ban. “We have been told by the Foreign Office they are working on it, but it is more complicated because the Iranians chose to see him as an American, but it is not for the Iranians to decide. “He is stuck in a political chess game but as a pawn, but we feel no one is protecting him now because his country has left him behind. He is British and British-born no less and that should have saved him from that fate. “But here we are despite the Foreign Office advice to stay quiet and out of the press. We are now trying to shed light and ask questions because he should never have been left behind as a British citizen. “It was essential to us and to him that he was not forgotten.” Family members believe the British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, made the political decision to leave Tahbaz behind in the interest of securing the release of the others, and was misleading about the agreed length of his furlough from jail. They claim he was offered only 48 hours at his family home, not a permanent furlough, but that is disputed. There was also confusion within the family home, including for some elderly relatives, about the presence of a large number of armed guards. A potential deal nearly 18 months ago involving all three British-Iranians did not go ahead when the British refused to accept Iran’s exclusion of Tahbaz. The Foreign Office said it was working to secure his permanent release, but his plight has been made more difficult by the fact that he is a tri-national and Iran treats him primarily as a US citizen. The US special envoy for Iran, Rob Malley, said at the weekend the US had agreed that the British would take the lead in the talks about the plight of US dual nationals. The US has no direct diplomatic relations with Iran. That effectively means Tahbaz is being treated as part of a US-Iranian trade, probably in the context of the outcome of the Iran nuclear talks.

3/29/2022,"“We do not condone violence.” “Assault is never the answer.” These words have echoed through all of my social media accounts since Will Smith slapped Chris Rock for making a poor-taste joke about Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith. The joke referenced Pinkett Smith’s shaved head, a decision she made due to her struggles with the autoimmune disease alopecia. Most people agree the slap shouldn’t have happened. But there’s something that feels precious at best, and downright racist at worst, about white people’s reaction to the now-infamous smack. The Hollywood director Judd Apatow declared in a deleted tweet that Smith “could have killed” Rock (seriously?), calling it “​​pure out of control rage and violence”. Apatow later confirmed he wasn’t even watching the show when he made the remarks. The radio host Howard Stern compared Smith to Donald Trump, while white women on Twitter somehow decided that Smith’s actions meant he must be beating his wife. It would seem that there’s a layer of hyper-violence that’s being projected on to Smith simply because he is a Black man who was defending his Black wife. While it’s justifiable – important, even – to interrogate his motives for delivering the slap (was this really all about defending his wife or more about his own ego?), it’s clear that the backlash against Smith is rooted in not just anti-Blackness, but respectability politics as well. It’s also not just about what Smith did; it’s where he did it and who was watching. Anyone who has been following these shows can see that Smith is being held up to much stricter standards than white men who have behaved just as badly or even worse in those settings. In 1973, John Wayne had to be restrained by six security guards when he tried to rush the stage and attack the Native American actress and activist Sacheen Littlefeather. Littlefeather was on stage to accept the best actor award on behalf of Marlon Brando, who was boycotting the awards in protest at Hollywood’s depictions of Native Americans. Wayne got to keep his awards after the incident, but pending a review, Smith could very well have his historic best actor win revoked. Mind you, this is the same academy that gave Roman Polanski an award in absentia after he pleaded guilty to a charge of unlawful sex with a minor and fled the country before he could be sentenced. The double standard is glaring. I also find it hard to believe that the same white audiences who consume violence against Black people on screen to an almost fetishistic degree (and are quite happy to have the Academy reward these gratuitously violent projects year after year) are so distraught about an open-palm slap. Again, this kind of performative pearl-clutching is only ever reserved for Black men who mess up. But white outrage isn’t the only problem. For Black people who have been conditioned to constantly perform the most non-threatening version of themselves in order to retain white approval, the image of a Black man being “violent” in a space notorious for its overwhelming whiteness must have felt like an abomination. The ESPN commentator Stephen A Smith lambasted the actor on Twitter for “staining” the greatest moment of his career, before taking to a video to express his disappointment. It’s the Black Hollywood equivalent of being dragged to a corner and told off by your parents for “cutting up” in public and embarrassing your family. Except Smith isn’t a child and the stakes here are much higher. Either way, it’s clear that many people (even those in the community who mean well) only find the incident so objectionable because they hoped Smith would perform propriety for white people in that space. But let’s not forget why all this started in the first place. In case there was any confusion, alopecia is absolutely a disability, and one that Black women are more prone to. Whether or not Rock knew about Pinkett Smith’s condition, the politics of Black women’s hair is well known to be a historically fraught and often traumatising topic (he should know – he made a documentary about it in 2009). Still, this kind of punching down on Black women remains typical of many Black male comedians who, like the rest of the world, don’t see Black women’s struggles and experiences as real or legitimate. And this lack of care for Black women also partly explains why people were so taken aback by the image of Smith standing up for his wife in that way. The world is so used to seeing Black women as unworthy of being protected and fought for that it can’t see any merit to Smith’s actions or the emotions that spurred them. Smith has since apologised to Rock and the Academy, and this event will soon become just another wild story in our pop culture memory. But as we await the results of the Academy’s investigation, what I hope will remain is the opportunity to truly question how society views Black men, what we see as disability, and who we see as worthy of protecting.

3/29/2022,"Fresh talks between Ukraine and Russia have begun in Istanbul, with Kyiv seeking a ceasefire without compromising on its sovereignty or territorial integrity and both sides playing down hopes of an early breakthrough. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, opened the talks on Tuesday – the two delegations’ first face-to-face meeting in more than a fortnight – at the Dolmabahçe Palace in Istanbul, urging both sets of negotiators to “put an end to this tragedy”. With Russia’s invasion appearing stalled on the ground, Erdoğan said each side had “legitimate concerns” but added: “We have now entered a period where concrete results are needed.” It should be “possible to reach a solution acceptable to the international community”, he said, with further conflict “in no one’s interest”. Ukrainian media said the talks – with the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich in attendance – started with “a cold welcome and no handshake”. Mykhailo Podolyak, a political adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymr Zelenskiy, said delegations were working on “the entire spectrum of contentious issues”. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said the least he was hoping for was an end to the country’s humanitarian catastrophe, and the most was a ceasefire. “We are not trading people, land or sovereignty,” he insisted. “If we see that the mood has changed and they are ready for a serious, substantive conversation and balanced arrangements, then things will move forward,” Kuleba said. He said if it was a “repetition of their propaganda”, then talks would again fail. A senior US state department official said Russia’s leader, Vladimir Putin, did not seem ready to make any compromises to end the war, and Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian interior minister, said that he doubted there would be a breakthrough. Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February has killed an estimated 20,000 people, forced more than 10 million from their homes – including more than 3.8 million who have fled the country – and triggered an unprecedented range of western economic sanctions on Russia. Kyiv has suggested Moscow may be more flexible after failing in its initial aim of encircling the Ukrainian capital and forcing the government’s capitulation, as its forces were held up by logistical failings, heavy losses and stiff Ukrainian resistance. “We have destroyed the myth of the invincible Russian army,” the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, said. “We are resisting against the aggression of one of the strongest armies in the world and have succeeded in making them change their goals.” Ukrainian intelligence said on Tuesday thatPutin was seeking to compensate for his “weakened, disoriented” forces by trying to destroy cities through “indiscriminate artillery fire and rocket-bomb attacks”. Moscow said last week it was shifting its focus to expanding the territory held by pro-Russian separatists in the contested Donbas region, where Zelenskiy has previously hinted some compromise might be possible. Zelenskiy has also warned repeatedly, however, that while Ukraine might be prepared to accept some kind of neutral status with international guarantees, the country’s “sovereignty and territorial integrity” remain its top priority in any talks. Putin has demanded the “demilitarisation and denazification” of Ukraine, as well as the imposition of neutral status and recognition of the Donbas and Crimea, which Moscow seized in 2014, as no longer part of Ukrainian territory. Ukrainian forces retook Irpin, north-west of Kyiv, from Russian troops, who were regrouping to take the area back, Zelenskiy said late on Monday. “We still have to fight, we have to endure,” he said. “We can’t raise expectations.” A senior US defence official said Ukrainian troops had also retaken Trostyanets, south of Sumy, in the east, adding that Russia’s forces remained largely in defensive positions near Kyiv and were making little forward progress elsewhere in the country. Humanitarian conditions remain catastrophic in several southern and eastern cities, however, including the besieged and heavily bombarded southern port city of Mariupol, where the mayor’s office has said nearly 5,000 people have been killed, including about 210 children. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said she hoped three humanitarian corridors would be opened on Tuesday to evacuate civilians from besieged towns and cities, including Mariupol. Earlier peace talks, both by video and in person, failed to make progress towards a ceasefire. The latest round takes place against the background of allegations that delegates to previous informal talks in Kyiv in early March were poisoned. Abramovich and a Ukrainian MP and peace negotiator, Rustem Umerov, suffered symptoms consistent with poisoning earlier this month, according to a source with direct knowledge of the incident. Both men, who consumed only chocolate and water, were treated for symptoms that reportedly included loss of sight and peeling skin. The allegations were first reported in the Wall Street Journal and by the investigative outlet Bellingcat.",News/World news,Ukraine-Russia peace talks start in Turkey amid warnings they may again fail,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/29/ukraine-russia-peace-talks-istanbul-war-kyiv
3/29/2022,"The British Museum is facing legal action from one of the UK’s leading heritage preservation organisations over its refusal to allow the 3D scanning of a piece in its Parthenon marbles collection. The Institute for Digital Archaeology (IDA) has said it would serve an injunction against the museum imminently, raising the stakes in the dispute between the two. “We will be filing a complaint by the end of the week requesting the court to order the British Museum to grant our request,” Roger Michel, the IDA’s executive director, told the Guardian. “We want them to treat our application in exactly the same fashion that they would treat similar requests. Their refusal has been capricious and arbitrary.” The Oxford-based institute had hoped, with the museum’s blessing, to reproduce one of the high relief metopes from the Acropolis temple’s south facade as “proof of concept.” In 2016 it reconstructed Syria’s Palymyra arch of triumph out of Egyptian marble based on photographs following the monument’s destruction by Islamic State. Advocates believe 3D imaging could be employed to not only create replicas of the classical treasures but help resolve the longstanding row between Athens and London over patrimony of the Parthenon marbles. Scans would allow a robot sculptor to reproduce the artworks with sub-millimetre accuracy using the same Pentelic marble from which the originals were chiselled, according to the IDA, a supporter of the marbles’ repatriation to Greece. “Our aim is to give people a chance to see just how extraordinary a copy can be,” said Michel, a Harvard-trained American lawyer who founded the institute, which has collaborated with Unesco, and describes its mission as preserving and restoring ancient artefacts at a time when irreplaceable objects are under “obvious threat” of being lost forever. “Copies [of the Parthenon sculptures] in the past have been low-quality plaster casts. This will be orders of magnitude better. It will help people see and feel the potential of this technology in ways mere words can’t describe.” Peter Higgs, the museum’s acting keeper of Greek and Roman antiquities, conceded that digital scanning of the 5th-century BC sculptures could “unlock new discoveries”, but the IDA was told by email that its request could not be facilitated, five weeks after it was made. Michel and his team visited the British Museum last week despite the ban, deploying what he described as an “iPad on steroids” to scan the piece from the floor of the Duveen gallery. The organisation argued it was within its rights to do so as the British Museum’s own guidelines “plainly authorise” the use of 3D software to capture images of the antiquities in the gallery, it said. The news, however, prompted anger from the museum. “The British Museum was deeply concerned to hear suggestions that unauthorised scanning took place in our galleries. Any such activity would be a breach of our visitor regulations,” a statement said. “We regularly receive requests to scan the collection from a wide range of private organisations … and it is not possible to routinely accommodate all of these.” Michel responded in an email seen by the Guardian: “The guidelines plainly authorise exactly what we did, referencing as they do ‘3D software’, ‘3D imaging’, ‘scans’, ‘scanned data’, ‘cameras’, and ‘phone cameras’. “Far from expressing any doubts about the propriety of our activities, your security staff were eager to learn more about the process and were most helpful and encouraging. I’m sure it was all captured by your CCTV. In view of all these facts, your characterisation of our activities represents a gross distortion of the truth; I hope you will correct your obvious misstatements forthwith.” In a later statement to the Guardian after the IDA’s threat of legal action, a museum spokesperson restated it was not possible to routinely accommodate all requests from “private organisations – such as the IDA – alongside academics and institutions who wish to study the collection”, saying it was important to it that “any request is properly supported so that, to the best of our ability, we can ensure the highest levels of quality and academic rigour”. It added that it already used cutting-edge technologies to explore and share its collection and had facilitated visits from the Acropolis Museum in 2013 and 2017 for 3D scanning. The scanning furore has dismayed officials in Greece at time of a shift in attitudes among some of the world’s leading museums to the repatriation of contested artefacts. “How in the world can they deny such a request when the museum boasts about its educational and enlightening role?” said Elena Korka, the honorary director general of antiquities and cultural heritage at the culture ministry in Greece. “What is so worrying about a scan? To me it seems totally absurd and in total contradiction to the museum’s self-professed role.” The antiquities, regarded as the high point of classical art, have been in the British Museum’s possession since 1816 after their removal from the Parthenon at the behest of Lord Elgin, the British ambassador to the Ottoman empire, which at the time controlled what is now modern Greece. Successive Greek governments have argued that the antiquities were illegally hacked from the temple at a time when it was a subject nation without voice or sovereignty. The British Museum says they were legally acquired. Emboldened by surveys showing a majority of Britons supporting their return, the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has reinvigorated the campaign to reunite the artworks with the rest of the monumental frieze, displayed in the Acropolis Museum within view of the site where the sculptures once stood. In an unprecedented step Mitsotakis placed the issue at the centre of talks with Boris Johnson in Downing Street last November, reminding the UK prime minister of his love for Greece. As a classics student at Oxford, Johnson had been a supporter of the statuary being sent back to Athens. Michel said that while his team had managed to complete most of the digital imaging with the help of the iPad program, there were still parts of the metope that could be better scanned with a ladder if a permit was eventually granted. “There is a little bit at the top that we would like to get a better look at,” he said. In their present form, “battered and whitewashed” in the Duveen gallery, the IDA director argues, the sculptures bear no relation to the their true aesthetic in antiquity – something, he believes, the creation of replicas could also help resolve. “Reconstruction could restore the coloured surfaces of the originals – including a range of skin tones,” he said. “In short, reconstructions could help the British Museum do all the things it claims it wants to do so much better.”",Arts/Art and design,British Museum facing legal action over Parthenon marbles 3D scan refusal,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/29/british-museum-facing-legal-action-parthenon-marbles-3d-scan-refusal
3/29/2022,"A man who reportedly escaped from a prison van in Dorset dressed only in his underpants and socks has been found and arrested by armed officers. Kyle Eglington, 32, fled the van in Poole on Saturday after allegedly assaulting a security officer. The National Police Air Service helicopter and the British Transport Police were involved in the search for him and on Sunday police said he may have shaved his head and beard to change his appearance. Armed officers caught him on Monday evening. A Dorset police spokesperson said: “Officers searching for a man who reportedly escaped from lawful custody can confirm he has been located. “Dorset police received a report at 11.13am on Saturday 26 March 2022 that 32-year-old Kyle Darren Eglington had made off from a court prisoner transport vehicle in Hardy Road in Poole, having allegedly assaulted one of the security officers. “Following extensive inquiries, Kyle Eglington was located by officers from Dorset police’s tactical firearms team during the evening of Monday 28 March 2022 and arrested on suspicion of assault and escaping from lawful custody. We would like to thank everyone who shared our appeals.” Eglington had been remanded in custody after being charged with robbery in relation to an incident in Bournemouth on Thursday and appeared at Poole magistrates court the next day. Appealing for help in tracing him, Supt Heather Dixey, of Dorset police, said: “I would like to reassure members of the public that we have a number of officers carrying out searches and other inquiries in a bid to locate Kyle Eglington as soon as possible and return him to lawful custody. “I would urge anyone who has seen a man in the area in just his underwear and socks, or who matches the description given [white, 5ft 11 in tall and of medium build, with dark brown hair and a beard] and appears to be avoiding detection, to please report it to us. “There is nothing to suggest he poses a risk to the general public. However, we would urge people not to approach him and to please dial 999 immediately. “There will be an extensive police presence in the area as we carry out these inquiries and officers can be approached by members of the community with any concerns.”",News/UK news,Dorset police arrest man reported to have escaped prison van in underpants,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/29/dorset-police-arrest-man-reported-to-have-escaped-prison-van-in-underpants
