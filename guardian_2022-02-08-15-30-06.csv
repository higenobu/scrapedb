2/8/2022,"Hello, I’m Warren Murray, and I hope this will help you feel more on top of things.  MPs from all sides have accused Boris Johnson of whipping up political poison after the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, was set upon by protesters who accused him of protecting the paedophile Jimmy Savile. Starmer and the shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, had to be bundled into a police car after anti-vax protesters surrounded him near parliament with shouts of “traitor” and “Jimmy Savile”. The former chief whip Julian Smith described the events as appalling and said the prime minister’s false Savile slurs must be “withdrawn in full”. Johnson said the behaviour directed at Starmer was “absolutely disgraceful” and “completely unacceptable” but once again stopped short of apologising. Johnson is expected to reshuffle his team today including possibly sacking the chief whip, Mark Spencer. The prime minister will also continue a No 10 overhaul after recruiting Steve Barclay, the Cabinet Office minister, as his chief of staff, and Guto Harri, his former spokesperson, as his new director of communications. Harri has drawn criticism from Labour over his previous job for a lobbying firm that worked for Huawei, the company linked to the Chinese Communist party that has been banned from the UK’s 5G mobile network. Diplomacy but no detente – Emmanuel Macron and Vladimir Putin had nothing in the way of a breakthrough to show for five hours of talks at the Kremlin on the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Macron, the French president, is due today in Kyiv to hold talks with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has met with Joe Biden at the White House. Biden insisted the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany would be shut down if Russia attacked, but Scholz would not be so specific. Biden said of Putin: “I know that he’s in a position now to be able to invade, almost assuming that the ground is frozen above Kyiv. He has the capacity to do that. What he’s going to do I don’t know.” The president advised US civilians to leave Ukraine, saying: “I don’t want them to get caught in the crossfire.” As the Russian build-up continues, Britain has agreed to send a further 350 troops to Poland. Over-18 checks on porn sites – British users of pornography websites would have to provide credit card or passport details to prove they are over 18 under revived plans. Ministers have said the forthcoming online safety bill will cover commercial porn sites, updating draft legislation that now applies to providers of user-generated pornography such as OnlyFans. More than a third of the British population are estimated to watch online pornography, according to estimates by the age verification industry, meaning age checking could be both an enormous technical challenge and potentially big business. High street faces hit – Britain’s biggest retailers have warned the cost of living crisis will mean consumers tightening their purse strings over the coming months. Households already grappling with rising energy bills, petrol prices, tax, mortgage payments and rent can also expect to pay more for groceries this year. Supermarkets are responding by cutting back on staff costs; squeezing farmers and other suppliers not to increase their prices; “shrinkflation” tactics such as reducing the amount in a pack of peanuts while keeping the price the same; and cutting out unnecessary product lines. And while it won’t solve the energy price crunch, thousands of homes could soon be paid to halve their electricity usage during high-demand times. Octopus Energy and the National Grid are to trial the scheme. Toxins in tap water – Drinking water containing dangerously high levels of toxic chemicals known as PFOS was piped into the homes of more than 1,000 people in south Cambridgeshire, the Guardian can reveal. The aquifer supplying the affected houses, close to Duxford airfield, was found to have PFOS levels at almost 400 nanograms per litre (ng/l) of water – four times the Drinking Water Inspectorate’s limit. Cambridge Water has admitted it removed the supply in June last year and said the exposure was under investigation. It admitted it had not told the community but said it had blended the water with another source. It would not say how long the villages had been drinking the contaminated supply, only that modelling and sampling undertaken in 2020 suggested the levels were previously below 100ng/l. PFOS has been associated with increased cholesterol, low birthweight and suppressed immune response. In the past it was used in firefighting foams, including at airfields. Defra, the Drinking Water Inspectorate and the Environment Agency declined to comment. Runs like it’s on rails – The Elizabeth line must be “flawless” before it can officially launch this year, London’s transport chief has said, amid speculation that the £18.9bn Crossrail project’s opening could be moved to the spring – before the Queen’s jubilee celebrations. As trials continue, Gwyn Topham, the Guardian’s transport correspondent, has taken a trip on the line, riding on spacious trains along the tunnels winding from Paddington to Liverpool Street. The official deadline for opening is the end of June. Andy Byford, the transport commissioner, said he would not give the go-ahead until entirely satisfied: “Better to take an extra couple of weeks, after how long Londoners have had to wait, than have people loving the surroundings but disappointed by the reliability. Some days it is 98% on time, but some days have been 80%, and that’s not good enough.” With endorsements from celebrities and ads on TikTok, cryptocurrency has gone mainstream.

2/8/2022,"A former comrade of ex-soldier Ben Roberts-Smith has been forced to defend his service record and court evidence during a cross-examination where he was accused of being jealous and throwing Roberts-Smith “under a bus”. The anonymous SAS soldier known as Person 14 served eight deployments in Afghanistan including missions alongside Roberts-Smith.  Person 14 on Tuesday refused to answer questions about whether he had been a source for journalists and media reports. The judge in charge of the defamation case, justice Anthony Besanko, did not compel him to answer. In his evidence last week, Person 14 told the court that in April 2009 he helped form a protective cordon around the compound Whiskey 108 – a known insurgent base in the village of Kakarak. He told the court he saw in fading light a soldier carrying a Minimi machine gun – and wearing the distinctive face paint only worn by Roberts-Smith’s five-man patrol – throw a “dark figure” to the ground outside the compound before firing a one-second burst of machine-gun fire into the figure. Person 14 later examined the slain body who had a prosthetic leg. He said later on that mission he saw Roberts-Smith carrying a Minimi machine gun – a distinctive and unusual weapon. Person 14 also said that, in 2012, he witnessed Roberts-Smith order a member of the Afghan national army, through an interpreter, to murder a captive and unarmed man. The killing was carried out. Under cross-examination on Tuesday, Person 14 defended his evidence, debating with barrister Arthur Moses SC, acting for Roberts-Smith, over his recollections of missions in Afghanistan. Moses and Person 14 debated whether a figure thrown to the ground and shot during a raid on a village in 2009 was wearing “dark” or “black” clothing and whether the prosthetic leg was “beige” or “white”. Roberts-Smith earlier told the court he killed the man with the prosthetic leg but he was an insurgent running outside the compound and carrying a weapon – and was, therefore, a legitimate target killed within the laws of war. Moses said Person 14’s version of events was a fiction: “It didn’t happen did it?” “It 100% happened,” Person 14 said. “You have come here to throw Mr Roberts-Smith under the bus any way you can, haven’t you?” Moses said. “No,” was the reply. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Person 14 conceded he had drunk alcohol from the prosthetic leg after it was souvenired by another member of the SAS and taken to the soldiers’ on-base bar called the Fat Ladies Arms. Asked why he drank from the leg, Person 14 told the court: “It helped me decompress, let off steam, bond … [it is a] high-tempo life, you never know when your last day is coming.” Person 14 was also forced to defend his own service record over an alleged fight with a female US officer in Afghanistan during a party at the allied forces Tarin Kowt base. He told the court he had been officially reprimanded and prevented from going on a deployment to Afghanistan over a hard drive containing photos from his Afghanistan service that he said was stolen from his house by his estranged wife. He had been in the middle of a divorce, he told the court on Tuesday, when his wife had allegedly broken into his home and stolen the hard drive. Person 14 alleged in court his wife tried to blackmail him for $50,000 – threatening to leak the photographs to the media. Person 14 reported the loss of the hard drive to his superiors and a senior officer had to “negotiate” for the return of the files, the court heard. He later accepted a charge of disobeying a lawful general order. This charge meant he was not allowed to tour Afghanistan in 2010. On that mission, during a battle at Tizak, Roberts-Smith stormed machine gun posts for which he was later awarded the Victoria Cross, Australia’s highest military honour. Person 14 was asked whether he resented “the fact that Mr Roberts-Smith was awarded a VC?” “No,” he said. Pressed again on whether he resented Roberts-Smith being awarded a VC for actions on a tour he wasn’t allowed to go on, Person 14 replied: “No.” “But you were upset about not being able to go on that tour?” the barrister asked. The soldier replied: “100%.” Roberts-Smith is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges are defamatory and portray him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies all wrongdoing. In his evidence, Roberts-Smith told the court that winning the VC had made him a target for rumours, hostility and spiteful undermining from other soldiers. The medal, he said “put a target on my back”. Person 14 said he had not undermined Roberts-Smith and had a solid working relationship with him. He “had his doubts” about the veracity of Roberts-Smith’s citation for the VC but he kept them to himself. The trial continues.",News/Australia news,"SAS soldier denies being jealous of Ben Roberts-Smith and wanting to throw him ‘under a bus’, court hears",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/08/sas-soldier-denies-being-jealous-of-ben-roberts-smith-and-wanting-to-throw-him-under-a-bus-court-hears
2/8/2022,"Abushy pathway leads to the crossing points along the Limpopo River that are the most treacherous part of the journey for Zimbabweans seeking a better life in South Africa. The river has flooded after weeks of incessant rain, resulting in three drownings of “border jumpers” last month alone. A few kilometres away, where the roar of the river can still be heard, men and women clutching small bags of belongings trudge along a different dusty track near Malindi Transit Shed. At 9am on a Friday morning in February, the route to the bridge connecting South Africa and Zimbabwe is already heavily patrolled by soldiers clasping rifles.  The journey to Beitbridge on the Zimbabwean side is punctuated by five security checkpoints, with a bribe of 50 rand (£2.40) required by the soldiers and police at each stop. “Where are you going? Come here!” shouts a soldier at a woman in a black tracksuit. After questioning her, he allows the woman to pass. The path continues to the old Alfred Beit Bridge, where the road crosses the Limpopo between Musina in South Africa and Beitbridge in Zimbabwe. Here, border-jumping guides, known as magumaguma, are ready to assist in illegal crossings. It is a steady stream, as Zimbabweans fleeing economic turmoil seek opportunities in South Africa, a more stable economy. Rising inflation, unemployment and poverty drives most Zimbabweans to make the journey. Those who can afford the bribes take the bridge. Others try their luck in the fast-flowing waters, where crocodiles swim. The risks are high: about 100 Zimbabweans are deported daily, according to South Africa’s Department of Home Affairs. But Zimbabweans with little left at home are still making the journey in their droves. “You just pay 20 or 50 rand and they will let you pass. But at every stop, you have to part with something. This is the price one pays to gain safe passage,” says Gain Murambiwa*, 38, a taxi driver. Another driver says it is more expensive in South Africa, where security has been stepped up. “Anyone serious about crossing should at least part with 600 rand, because it is more expensive in South Africa. I normally do five or six trips because many people want to jump the border and we are here to help. There is brisk business when the border is closed like this,” he says. Moud Mbedzi*, 39, is hoping to join her husband, who left for South Africa before the pandemic. Holding a small bag of clothes, she says: “I have already communicated with someone on the other side who will help me get past security into South Africa.” She has left her two children in the care of her mother. “Luckily, my husband found a job and if I get one also, we will get enough money to take care of our children. It’s sad to leave them but I have to go,” she says. Another hopeful traveller is Bright Ntepe*, 30, an engineering graduate. “There is nothing here for me. I have tried everything. Maybe there is a better life for me in South Africa. I know it is not going to be easy but I will try,” Ntepe says. The high river levels are undoubtedly deterring some. At Spillway, a once-popular illegal crossing about a mile from Beitbridge, the men fishing say the river is too dangerous to cross. “We hardly see anyone coming to cross because the waters are too deep. It is very quiet these days,” says 30-year-old Arnold Muzemba*. But at other spots the risky crossings continue. Farther along the river, a group of men are repairing a broken wooden boat at one of the few illegal crossing points still in use since the river started rising. Moses Mbedzi*, 40, transports both people and goods across the river. His raft is big enough to carry 12 people at a time, plus a refrigerator or other home appliances. Smugglers also pay large sums to move contraband across. Driving home a nail as he tries to finish the work before the rain comes, he says three of his boats have been destroyed by the authorities in recent weeks, so he is making another one. “This is the only job I know. How do I feed my family without helping people to cross? I know it is a dangerous job but I have to do it,” Mbedzi says. “The day before yesterday, they [the security forces] destroyed my raft, but luckily they left the rope that we use to control the raft so that it is not swept away by the current. “This is a dangerous undertaking, but I cannot sit at home and do nothing.” The Limpopo runs for about 160 miles (260km) along the border, and the police have just eight bases, 20 miles apart, making it difficult to control. “These people are adamant. We always take their boats but you will see them the next day with a new one. They even tried to create a wooden bridge years ago but it was destroyed by our South African counterparts,” a Zimbabwean soldier says. Zimbabweans who succeed in breaching the border still have to get past dozens of roadblocks on the other side. According to South Africa’s home affairs minister, Aaron Motsoaledi, 13,387 people were arrested at roadblocks between 10 December and 31 December last year for border jumping and smuggling-related offences. The pandemic has exacerbated smuggling between the two countries, with the South African Police Service (SAPS) saying smuggled goods include cigarettes, explosives and stolen vehicles. “The South African Police Service is working together with other stakeholders in the Justice, Crime Prevention and Security cluster at the borders as well as on the border line to curb illegal crossings of persons and the smuggling of items,” says its spokesperson, Col Athlenda Mathe. “On a weekly basis, there are undocumented persons who are mostly job-seekers that are apprehended by the SAPS and handed over to Zimbabwean authorities through a repatriation process which is dealt with by the Department of Home Affairs,” says Mathe. But even as the authorities in both countries try to stem the flow across the border, the economic crisis in Zimbabwe shows no sign of easing and the number of people prepared to risk the crossing for a better life is only rising. * Names have been changed to protect their identity",News/Global development,Desperate Zimbabweans risk police or crocodiles in bid to reach South Africa,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/08/desperate-zimbabweans-face-police-or-crocodiles-in-bid-to-reach-south-africa
2/8/2022,"Australia’s women finished a clean sweep of the one-day matches concluding the multiformat Ashes series, winning the third ODI by eight wickets to ensure that England finished winless on tour. A total of 163 was passed by Australia in 36.2 overs, with the old firm of Meg Lanning and Ellyse Perry unbeaten after 90 runs together. In a final series points tally of 12-4, England’s points came from two 20-over matches that were rained off and Canberra’s last-gasp Test match draw. England attempted a shake-up, leaving out opener Lauren Winfield-Hill, middle-order bat Sophia Dunkley, and in-form bowler Kate Cross to make room for squad players Emma Lamb, Tash Farrant and Freya Davies, with Danni Wyatt moving up from No7 to accommodate the latter two bowlers. Given her team’s previous innings of 129 after being sent in, there was boldness in Heather Knight’s decision to bat first. On the same Junction Oval surface in Melbourne, at the same 10am, she looked like a captain determined to make her charges take on a challenge and rectify their mistakes.  What followed instead was a collective resiling from that. Asked to open the batting on her one-day debut in the last match of a lost tour, Lamb was led in proverbial style to her quick dispatching by Ellyse Perry. Tammy Beaumont, Knight, and Natalie Sciver proceeded to play with ovine timidity. Three scoreless overs followed the Lamb dismissal, then as soon as Knight stroked a couple of boundaries she was yorked by Tahlia McGrath. The score at ten overs was 20 for 2. On went Beaumont and Sciver, blocking straight back down the pitch. Perry bowled a good spell of six overs straight, backed up by Megan Schutt, McGrath, and Annabel Sutherland. It was a tricky surface where attacking shots were hard to time, and there was the pressure of a long tail with Sophie Ecclestone batting at seven. But whether through shortcomings in technique or confidence, there was very little attempt to work singles around, turning good balls into chances to dart between the wickets. In that vacuum of action, the Australians just kept hitting a good length and racking up the dots. After 25 overs in England’s previous debacle on Sunday, the score was 67 for 6. After 25 overs in this episode, it was 67 for 2. If anything, the relative lack of wickets lost made the second score the more egregious. There was no plan, just a thought bubble that survival meant something would magically happen. Phase one was bat all day, phase three was profit, but nobody could remember what was supposed to happen in phase two. With Beaumont on 29 from 86 balls, she finally came to life in the 31st over, lofting six down the ground from spinner Jess Jonassen before hitting three fours in her next five balls. But few players can switch from scoring no runs to scoring all of them, so she soon hit leg-spinner Alana King to mid off for an even 50 from 101 balls. Wyatt walked in feeling pressure to explode, hit one six, then was caught at deep cover from Sutherland. Schutt returned the ball, bowled the next over and trapped Sciver lbw on review for 46 off 95 balls. From 125 for 5 with a little more than ten overs to go, the rest slipped away, Amy Jones playing a slog to rival her effort in the Canberra Test for pointlessness, Sutherland finishing with a career-best 4 for 31. Six of Australia’s seven bowlers went at less than four per over. Nor did the disparity improve in the field, with Alyssa Healy and Rachael Haynes clattering boundaries in a 74-run opening stand. Apparently it was possible to bat on that pitch after all. Wicketkeeper Jones dropped Healy from Davies’ first ball of the match, wrongfooting herself to a routine take, and while Davies eventually got Healy for 42, with Haynes following from Ecclestone, Lanning and Perry finished it off with 57 and 31 respectively. As the sides look ahead to the World Cup, departing for New Zealand in the next few days, the distinction could not more stark. England, defending champions from five long years ago, bowled out in seven of their last nine starts in the format, and looking freshly bewildered by it. Australia, batting down to number ten, eight bowling options in any given team, just off a world-record 26-match winning streak, unbeaten in a one-day series since 2013. First match for both teams in the World Cup is: Australia versus England.

2/8/2022,"Images that tell the story of war and conflict over more than 100 years are to go on display for the first time next year in new Imperial War Museum galleries. A multimillion-pound donation from the Blavatnik Family Foundation has enabled the museum to build art, film and photographic galleries at its London base. Acquisitions will be displayed alongside works from the museum’s existing collection, which dates from the first world war to the present day.  Among the works visitors will be able to see are Walter Sickert’s 1914 painting Tipperary, which the IWM recently bought with support of the Art Fund and the National Heritage Lottery Fund. Sickert painted several versions of Tipperary, but this is the only version that includes a soldier. Other artworks include John Singer Sargent’s six-metre-long 1919 painting Gassed, which brought home to audiences the reality of first world war fighting, and paintings by Paul Nash, Laura Knight and Steve McQueen. The galleries will include images from the IWM’s collection of more than 11m photographs, including ones by Cecil Beaton, Olive Edis, and the last picture by Tim Hetherington, taken on the day he was killed by shrapnel during the 2011 civil war in Libya. A highlight of the IWM’s 23,000 hours of film footage is Peter Jackson’s award-winning 2018 film They Shall Not Grow Old marking the centenary of the end of the first world war. Helen Mavin, the head of photographs at the IWM, said the images included ones taken by people involved in conflict, such as soldiers or medics, who happened to have access to cameras or felt compelled to record their experiences. “Across the chronological period we’re covering, you see a lot of the same themes coming up – comradeship, hardship, new things they’re experiencing. These are wonderful records of the individual experience of war; not all atrocity images, some of them are much more intimate, and engaging and compelling,” she said. “People have found a need throughout history to visually record their experiences. These are records that are very emotional, and it’s worth remembering that there’s always someone behind the camera making choices about what is seen and what’s not seen.” The Blavatnik Family Foundation is headed by Sir Len Blavatnik, an oil and media magnate who also owns Warner Music. Last year Blavatnik was named as the UK’s richest person, with a fortune of £23bn. The Ukrainian-born businessman, who made his fortune in Russia, said: “I have long taken a special personal interest in the history of conflict, and the experience of war.” The IWM’s new exhibition space, the Blavatnik Art, Film and Photography Galleries, will open to the public in late 2023.",Arts/Culture,Imperial War Museum to use billionaire’s gift to open new galleries,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/08/imperial-war-museum-new-galleries-blavatnik-family-foundation-donation
2/8/2022,"At around midnight one night last week, Sgt Matthew Jacobsen of the Portland police bureau in Oregon saw a man and a woman standing next to a silver Dodge Charger on a street corner. The trunk was open and Jacobsen said he saw a tactical vest with “DEA POLICE” written across it. The sergeant also saw red and blue police lights on the rear license plate and in the front exterior on the headliner.  Upon further investigation, Jacobsen found holsters, handcuffs, badges, credentials and an AR-15 style rifle – later identified as a BB gun. The man, identified as Robert Edward Golden, told Jacobsen that he and the woman were “feds” and that he was a federal agent working in Portland. The problem was, neither of them were. That same night, Jacobsen took the pair into the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Portland office, where Golden was arrested. In a criminal complaint filed last Thursday in the US district court of Oregon, first reported by the Daily Beast, federal prosecutors alleged that Golden had been impersonating a DEA special agent and had for the past year tricked the unsuspecting woman into believing that she was “training to be a DEA agent”. Golden allegedly told authorities that he and the woman “were into ‘cosplay’ (costume play) and that is why they had the police tactical vests with DEA/Police patches, fake guns and handcuffs.” He reportedly went on to reveal that he bought the fake badges and credentials from various websites, including Amazon, eBay and Wish. However, according to the complaint, in addition to providing the unnamed woman with a fake DEA badge, Golden took her on nightly fake ride-alongs for surveillance purposes and to practice shooting. He also took her to “speak with homeless individuals to develop ‘CIs’ (confidential informants) for future use in case ‘something happened’ to Golden and he was no longer around to take care of her”. The woman, who said she attended school for criminal justice and was given credentials by Golden, said that Golden also spoke of DEA agents named Anderson, Luis, Garcia and Bennett. According to her, Golden told her she would soon be training with other agents. The complaint states there are no agents in the DEA Portland division with those names. The agency also does not provide ride-alongs, the document said. “I believe Golden has been falsely personating a DEA agent to gain credibility as a federal agent by displaying false identification and badges to gain information from unsuspecting residents, and utilizing red and blue code-3 lighting to traverse through traffic,” wrote Morgan T Barr, DEA special agent, in the affidavit. The complaint said the woman had been “tricked” by Golden into believing that she was a trainee for the DEA. She is not thought to be facing any charges. Golden has since been released to await trial on a number of conditions, including needing to secure and maintain a full-time job or attend school or both, limit travel to Oregon unless granted permission otherwise, submit to random drug tests and participate in mental health evaluations. Golden’s lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment from multiple media outlets. If convicted, Golden could face up to three years in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000, according to Greg Nyhus, assistant US attorney.",News/US news,Man impersonating DEA ‘tricked’ woman to believe she was agent trainee,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/08/man-impersonating-federal-drug-enforcement-agent-arrested-portland
2/8/2022,"An electric shock might be just the thing to persuade a cloud to produce some rain. New research suggests that supercharging a cloud could increase the attractive forces between droplets and help raindrops to grow. Have we finally found the recipe for making rain? Electric charge is all around us. Thunderclouds literally crackle with it, but even the air we breathe has some charged aerosols and droplets in it. Giles Harrison, a meteorologist at the University of Reading, and colleagues have been investigating the electric charge of drops in non-thunderstorm clouds.  In calculations led by Maarten Ambaum and published in Proceedings of the Royal Society A, they show that the greater the variation in charges, the stronger the attraction between droplets. “This advances our understanding of how charge influences drop growth and brings a new aspect to answering the age-old question: why does it rain?” says Harrison. Last year Harrison and his colleagues, who have been funded by the United Arab Emirates to research rain enhancement, flew drones equipped with ionisers into clouds and experimented with releasing positive and negative charges into the air. The new results will help them fine-tune these experiments, potentially to find ways to hasten the formation of rain where it is needed.",News/News,Have we finally found the recipe for making rain?,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/08/have-we-finally-found-the-recipe-for-making-rain
2/8/2022,"An employee at a Home Depot in Arizona has scammed the company out of hundreds of thousands of dollars since 2018, by swapping out cash from the registers for fake $100 bills, according to a criminal complaint. Adrian Jean Pineda, who used to be in charge of counting the money in Home Depot registers in Tempe, allegedly siphoned $387,500 over four years through this scheme, the New York Times reported.  Pineda was tasked to bag the cash from the registers, put it in sealed bags and move it to an account at a Wells Fargo Bank, an access that allowed him to evade “the first layer of counterfeit detection – the cashier”, Frank Boudreaux Jr of the Secret Service told the Times. During this time, Pineda lived a lifestyle far beyond his means, according to Boudreaux, including buying a new car and hiring a personal trainer. In security footage, Pineda was reportedly seen stuffing bundles of real money into his pocket, and replacing the original notes with fake ones after cashiers brought him the registers’ bills. Boudreaux said investigators subpoenaed Pineda’s Amazon records – and the value of the fake bills he purchased mirrored the amount that Home Depot was reporting as their loss. After a manager confronted Pineda, he admitted to trading out the bills, the complaint said. Boudreaux said Pineda had agreed to pay restitution. Fake dollar bills are not hard to get online, and the ones Pineda allegedly used to scam his employers had “PLAYMONEY” written in place of serial numbers. On Amazon, there are scores of “prop money” listings from numerous sellers, most of them with high reviews. An Amazon search for “prop money” generates suggestions for more specific searches such as “prop money 100 dollar bills realistic”. For about $8, buyers can purchase 150 “pieces” that include bills and coins. The products on Amazon are advertised as “pretend play” for children or for “educational” purposes. And they seem to be a favorite for parents as well. “If you do not feel it, or read the small print, you will totally believe it is real money,” reads a review of one such product that received 4.5 stars. In a statement to the Times, Amazon said company policy bars fake currency “that is not prominently and permanently marked ‘COPY”.

2/8/2022,"Record women’s sport viewing figures for 2021 have been boosted by the 11 million new viewers that tuned into the Women’s Hundred and Women’s Super League, according to a new report. The Women’s Sport Trust’s “visibility uncovered” study has found that the audience for domestic women’s sport has bucked the trend of declining TV viewing hours generally and amassed a total audience of almost 32.9 million people last year, with football and cricket the biggest drivers of the newer audience.  Tammy Parlour, chief executive and co-founder of the WST, highlighted the importance of free-to-air broadcast deals alongside those that are subscription-based and said that their impact on women’s sports “should not be underestimated,” with free-to-air bringing in 19 million new viewers. Of the total number of women’s sport’s viewers, 41% of viewing hours went to cricket, while football contributed 39%, albeit with the new broadcast deal with BBC Sport and Sky Sports beginning with the new season in September. The report also found that the 5.9 million new viewers for the WSL had not watched any other sport in 2021 before the start of the season. Of the 4.9 million new viewers of the Hundred, 71% had gone on to watch other women’s sport, with tennis and football the biggest beneficiaries. Meanwhile 25% of those who watched the Women’s Hundred or England women’s cricket did not watch any men’s cricket in 2021. In football 6.2 million people watched live WSL games in 2021 without watching a Premier League game on TV, while 1.5 million people watched live W Series coverage without watching live F1. “Domestic competitions such as the Hundred and the Women’s Super League are the perfect gateway to viewing more women’s sport and I look forward to seeing the impact other major international events this year will have on future future viewing figures,” said Parlour. “We know how important these major events are in growing viewership figures but we want this growth to be sustainable, driving greater habits amongst audiences, to ensure women’s sport continues to be visible, viable and unstoppable.” In addition, the study highlighted the importance of major mixed events in attracting a female audience with Wimbledon and the Tokyo Paralympics both having the highest percentage of female viewers from major events, with 57%.",Sport/Sport,Women’s Hundred and Women’s Super League attract 11 million new viewers,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/08/womens-hundred-and-womens-super-league-attract-11-million-new-viewers
2/8/2022,"The worsening cost of living crisis has focused attention on the cost of the weekly shop. Households already grappling with rising energy bills, petrol prices, tax, mortgage payments and rent can also expect to pay more for groceries this year. At the weekend, the chair of the UK’s biggest supermarket chain, Tesco, warned “the worst is yet to come” for food price inflation, forecasting it would soon hit 5%.  Supermarkets are managing their own inflationary pressures, facing soaring bills for basic commodities, from coffee beans to milk and wheat, alongside rising packaging, transport, energy and staff costs. Yet in the fiercely competitive UK grocery sector, if they do not do all they can to keep a lid on price rises, they risk losing customers to rivals, including the fast-growing discounters Aldi and Lidl. So what kind of ammunition do supermarkets have to fight this price war, and what are they doing to limit increases on popular items while protecting profits? Payroll costs are in the spotlight. Brexit and the pandemic have disrupted the UK employment market, forcing retailers to offer wage incentives to fill vacancies. The legal minimum wage for those aged 23 or older also rises 6.6% to £9.50 in April. Tesco announced more than 1,600 job cuts last week, cutting back on night shifts and closing more deli and meat counters to concentrate staff on other, more profitable, shopfloor jobs. Sainsbury’s and Asda have also cut back on fresh food counters. Management roles, which like night shifts offer higher wages, are also being axed, along with staff benefits such as paid breaks and extra pay for Sundays or bank holidays. Other tactics to reduce staff costs include more automation, with self-service checkouts extended to shoppers with large trolleys in some stores, and incentivising shoppers to switch to self-scanning systems such as Sainsbury’s SmartShop or Tesco’s Scan as you Shop. Asda is testing automated facial recognition at self checkouts to judge shoppers’ age for purchases of restricted products such as alcohol. Behind the scenes, retailers are also looking at more automation in warehouses and stock rooms. Tesco is planning at least 25 robot-aided online grocery packing sites in the back of stores, while Ocado is developing a robotic system that will reduce the need for humans to pack bags or stack crates of groceries ready for delivery vans. The regular battles between supermarkets and those providing their produce have stepped up this year as manufacturers and farmers try to pass on rising costs. The groceries code adjudicator, Mark White, who oversees relations between the big supermarkets and their suppliers, has warned retailers against demanding that manufacturers give them fixed notice of price changes or other unfair practices. In a tough market, Ged Futter of the consultancy The Retail Mind, which advises many suppliers, says he has seen numerous foodmakers temporarily stop supply to nearly all the supermarkets as battles over price rises have escalated. Until recently he had only seen isolated instances of such practice. “They have got to a point where they have had to stop the trucks as they cannot afford to manufacture at those prices because the level of cost increases is so high. One of my clients’ packaging costs have gone up by 60%,” Futter said. “I’ve been training suppliers for seven years and working in grocery retail for 22 years and there has never been a time like this. The level of inflation is above 10%, it’s unprecedented.” Watch out for supermarkets cutting the size of your ready meal, packet of mushrooms or bag of apples as they try to offset cost increases by providing a little less for the same price. Their suppliers are also adopting shrinkflation tactics. Walkers has cut two bags of crisps from its 24-bag multipacks while the price stayed at £3.50. KP peanuts are now 225g instead of 250g for £2.50. Bryan Roberts, a retail analyst at the consultancy Shopfloor Insights, says own-label goods are likely to be a prime candidate for changes because they are not easy to compare with the previous week or to rival stores. “You have to be a very diligent shopper, or journalist, to monitor different lasagnes,” he said. Removing more expensiveingredients – such as butter – from pre-prepared food and reducing the size of packaging are also cost-cutting options. Other tactics include reducing the frequency of store deliveries and changing how or where food is produced or ingredients sourced in order to save costs. Retailers are focusing their resources on keeping prices low on key items and ditching less profitable or popular lines. Tesco last week removed CDs and DVDs from stores, after a similar move by Sainsbury’s, while Waitrose is stopping handing out free newspapers to its loyalty card holders, offering discounts on their favourite items instead. When staff costs are high, retailers look at ways to reduce the time it takes to do work in the store so that they don’t require such a large workforce. Look out for more shelf-ready packaging and gravity-fed shelving, with which goods are fed in at the back and move forward on tilted rollers when an item is removed. Shifting to electric vehicles, cargo bikes and trains – as already done by Tesco – is also likely to become more common as retailers try to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and HGV drivers, while also meeting carbon reduction targets. As pressure on household budgets increases, retailers say anecdotally they have seen a rise in shoplifting, known in the business as “shrinkage”. Experts have already spotted new measures to counteract stock loss including putting vulnerable products – even chocolate bars – in locked plastic boxes and only displaying cardboard cutouts or empty boxes of goods that tend to be targeted by thieves so that the real thing must be collected at the till.",News/Business,Cost of living crisis: how are UK supermarkets limiting price rises?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/08/cost-of-living-crisis-supermarkets-prices-tesco

2/8/2022,"Drinking water containing dangerously high levels of toxic chemicals has been pumped into the homes of more than 1,000 people, the Guardian can reveal. Cambridge Water has admitted it removed a supply containing four times the legal limit of perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) from the homes of customers in south Cambridgeshire in June last year. But the 1,080 customers living in Stapleford and Great Shelford were never informed that they had been exposed. The company has not revealed for how long the water had been tainted.  PFOS is a man-made chemical that has been associated with increased cholesterol, low birthweight and suppressed immune response. The chemical was widely used in firefighting foams from the late 1960s until the early 2000s in large quantities at airfields and firefighting training centres. Dubbed “forever chemicals” because they are designed never to break down in the environment, the substances can percolate through the ground for years, reaching drinking water aquifers. Jamie DeWitt, professor of pharmacology and toxicology at East Carolina University in the US, said: “People who have been consistently consuming water at [these levels] will have increased risk of certain types of diseases that have been linked to epidemiological studies … including changes in cholesterol … [and] reduced vaccine antibody responses, which is concerning because we really need our immune system to be working really well right now.” The aquifer supplying the affected houses, close to Duxford airfield, was found to have PFOS levels at almost 400 nanograms per litre (ng/l) of water – four times the Drinking Water Inspectorate’s limit. She said other chemicals in the wider polyfluoroalkyl substances family – known as PFAS – “have been linked to kidney and testicular cancer and those in utero or very young are at risk of developing health problems”. The people of the affected villages remain in the dark. Malcolm Watson, the chair of Great Shelford parish council, said: “We’ve heard nothing at all from Cambridge Water … they’ve been very backward at coming forward.” Belinda Irons, the clerk of Stapleford parish council, said the organisation “had no knowledge” of the contamination. Great Shelford is home to about 5,000 people and Stapleford about 2,000, according to Watson, who said he would be surprised if the larger village of Sawston, which lies between Duxford airfield and Great Shelford, had escaped contamination. Tony Fletcher, associate professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, described levels seen in Duxford as “clearly grossly exceeding anybody’s recommended limit for drinking water”. He said PFOS accumulates in the body, with a half-life of about three to five years. “Once you get them in your body it takes a long time for you to leach them out because of the process of active reabsorption,” he said. Cambridge Water said it removed the contaminated water from its supply in June and the exposure was under investigation. It admitted it had not told the community but said it had blended the water with another source. It said it was “unable to guarantee a blend below 100ng/l for our customers at all times and … previous samples taken from the same area have shown PFOS levels below 100ng/l”. The water firm will not say how long the villages have been drinking the contaminated supply, only that previous modelling and sampling undertaken in 2020 suggested the levels were previously below 100ng/l, although it would not give an exact concentration level. A spokesperson for Cambridge Water said it has a monitoring plan in place for 47 substances, as required by the Drinking Water Inspectorate, “using a laboratory that will have an accredited analytical method very soon”. It said “public health is our top priority and we will ensure all of our PFAS risk assessments are kept under continual review”. The UK has one of the highest acceptable PFOS thresholds in the world. Philippe Grandjean, of the University of Southern Denmark and adjunct professor of environmental health at Harvard, said acceptable concentrations would be reduced as more evidence appeared. “It’s similar to what happened with asbestos and lead. In the beginning people didn’t believe it was that bad.” The more of this class of chemical that is absorbed into the body, the greater the risk of adverse effects, Grandjean said. “You’re not going to get poisoned but the exposure will add to your risk of non-communicable disease, such as endocrine disruption, like thyroid gland problems – there may be problems with a host of diseases, like you’re at a greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes and obesity. “In regard to reproductive health, there’s a lesser chance of actually achieving pregnancy, and once a woman gets pregnant then there’s a greater likelihood of preterm birth and child that is low birthweight or lower than expected.” Duxford airfield’s spokesperson said no banned substances “are knowingly used anywhere across our estate” and that it no longer uses firefighting foam “and haven’t for years, as we are aware of the sensitivity of the aquifer that Duxford sits on top of”. There has been little testing of drinking water in the UK compared with other countries, but in October the Drinking Water Inspectorate told water companies to check their supplies for 47 types of PFAS. Defra, the Drinking Water Inspectorate and the Environment Agency declined to comment.",News/Environment,High levels of toxic chemicals found in Cambridgeshire drinking water,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/08/high-levels-of-toxic-chemicals-found-in-cambridgeshire-drinking-water
2/8/2022,"The Elizabeth line must be “flawless” before it can officially launch this year, London’s transport chief told a press tour on Monday, amid speculation that the £18.9bn Crossrail project’s opening could be moved to the spring – before the Queen’s jubilee celebrations. On the first media trip to see the line in action, riding on spacious trains along the tunnels winding from Paddington to Liverpool Street, flaws appeared conspicuously absent. Twelve trains an hour are now running in the central section excavated under the capital, with an official deadline for opening at the end of June.  Andy Byford, the transport commissioner, said the opening would be “a massive fillip to London’s morale and confidence” after the capital was drained of so much life during the pandemic. “When people arrive, day one, they will be blown away by the scale and by how quiet and smooth the train ride is.” On the concourse below the glass roof of Paddington’s Elizabeth line station, Byford’s words seemed no exaggeration, with trains arriving barely audibly behind the screens sealing the track from the platforms. Mark Wild, the chief executive of Crossrail, said it was “epic, a beautiful outcome”. Most of the volumes of the newly built stations, such as the control rooms, aren’t even visible, he said: “The Shard would fit in here quite comfortably.” For passengers, there is little “clutter”, as he puts it: upgraded information screens are above the automatic doors on platforms; all the trains are fully accessible. On board, it is hard to imagine the trains crowded – each carries up to 1,500 people – but they are wide and high enough to contain two rows of straps for any who do stand, and none should have to crick their neck beside a door. The scale is such that to walk to the cab for a driver’s eye view takes a good couple of minutes; at Liverpool Street, where the platform curves into the distance, one end comes out at Moorgate, a whole other stop on the tube till now. The project is in its final trial operations phase, when volunteers are encouraged to dawdle, block the doors and get in the way, to see how it stands up to routine use. Bigger exercises with 1,000 people are due to be carried out, including staged emergencies ranging from fires to gun attacks – complete with huge cans of soup to simulate, for example, the vomit of a fainting passenger. Bond Street, whose construction fell 18 months behind schedule, has been “clawed back”, said Byford, although it will not open with the rest of the line. It will instead be ready in late 2022, when direct through-trains from the west and east sections that run to Reading or Shenfield respectively will also start running under central London. Scepticism over Crossrail has grown after previous management promised it was “on time and on budget” until just a few months before the official opening planned for December 2018 was aborted. Now, though, it is tantalisingly close. However, Byford said he would not give the go-ahead until entirely satisfied: “It has to be flawless. Better to take an extra couple of weeks, after how long Londoners have had to wait, than have people loving the surroundings but disappointed by the reliability,” he said. “Some days it is 98% on time, but some days have been 80%, and that’s not good enough.”",News/UK news,‘It has to be flawless’: long wait for London’s Elizabeth line is nearly over,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/08/it-has-to-be-flawless-long-wait-for-londons-elizabeth-line-is-nearly-over
2/8/2022,"The first sight of Alecky Blythe’s new play, Our Generation, comes via a trailer on YouTube, which seems apt for a drama that aspires to take the pulse of today’s teenagers. Out it pours in the words of 12 young people from across the UK, whose comic ups and touching downs have been meticulously recorded over five years, with every stumble and repetition left intact. “I’m an only child, it’s just me, my mum, my cat, my dog and my deceased chicken,” explains one girl. Another frets: “I have a really itchy roof of my mouth. I think I have hay fever. I’ve gotta be at 100% health so I can watch Love Island.” Yet another bubbles: “I wanna go hajj so bad. And Australia. I wanna get a tan.” A play by Blythe has become a bit of an event – ever since, weary of trying to find an agent, the home counties-born actor turned to writing in an attempt to jump-start her stalled career. She specialises in verbatim pieces, created from recorded interviews, applying the same listening skills to scenarios as wildly various as the 2011 London riots, a talent contest in Stoke-on-Trent and a brothel for mature women in Bournemouth. “I got to a stage where I wasn’t getting much acting work, and I fell in love with [writing verbatim plays], because, well, you couldn’t make it up,” she says. “As an actor, I found real joy in the fact that you could play parts that maybe you wouldn’t normally play. It really opens up your range. And I discovered that I could do it.”  For Our Generation, which opens at the National Theatre in London this month, she and a team of other “collectors” with voice recorders gathered nearly 600 hours of testimony from interviewees in London, Birmingham, Northamptonshire, Anglesey, Glasgow and Belfast. They set out expecting the dramatic shape of the piece to follow that of the secondary school years, with its familiar waypoints of success or failure in exams. But they were ambushed by the pandemic, with the fortuitous result that its 254 scenes reveal how a generation has coped with prolonged stress. Seven weeks into rehearsals, Blythe and director Daniel Evans bustle into an interview room at the top of the National with the sort of adrenalised energy that comes from keeping a rehearsal schedule going on a road littered with the tintacks of positive Covid tests. The first three previews have been cancelled, and the 15-strong cast have only this morning started to rehearse without earphones. They don’t work from scripts but learn everything by copying the original speakers, piped directly into their ears, with Evans finding the dramatic shape while Blythe is ready to pounce every time they forget an “um” or fumble an “err”. It sounds like a form of torture to me, but they insist that even actors who are at first terrified usually come to love it. Perhaps surprisingly for a connoisseur of those unintentional wrinkles in conversation that reveal so much, Blythe’s own speech is as crisp and smooth as a freshly ironed sheet, unfolding in eloquent paragraphs as Evans sits quietly listening. There are two traditions of verbatim theatre: one, pioneered at Kilburn’s Tricycle theatre (now Kiln theatre) in London, uses pre-existing transcripts of trials or inquiries. Blythe, working in a tradition pioneered by the US actor Anna Deavere Smith and the British teacher/director Mark Wing-Davey, takes all her material from face-to-face interviews. When Blythe first started writing, her plays were performed with earphones still on: actors repeated, in real time, speech that was being piped directly into their ears. Her first play, premiered in 2003, was about a 15-day police siege in Hackney, east London, that ended with the death of 32-year-old Jamaican gangster Eli Hall. Pushing her way to the front of a police cordon, she picked up her title – Come Out Eli – from the chant of the people crowding outside, some of whom she went on to interview. Some reviewers felt uncomfortable about how exposed the method left her interviewees (“The technique of recreating the voices of the witnesses often makes people – whether absurdly posh or desperately inarticulate – just sound stupid,” grumbled one). But many more recognised that she had found a new way of giving a voice to one of London’s most diverse communities. “That play ended up being quite successful, and I got a literary agent off the back of it,” says Blythe. “So I went in a different direction. And for a little while, I was both writing them and performing in them.” That changed with her brothel play, The Girlfriend Experience, which ran in 2008 at the Royal Court. “The style changed slightly in that I was casting it more to type, and I wasn’t really the right type for any of the parts. It was the first time I stepped back and was just the writer. I really enjoyed it because I could commit to it a lot more.” She made a return to the stage for Little Revolution, though, a snapshot of the 2011 London riots, in which she played herself in a dramatised scary encounter with a group of looters, who had spotted her taking photographs. The situation could have been disastrous but, after checking her camera for incriminating images, they had let her go. Our Generation marks Blythe’s first return to the National Theatre since 2011, when she pushed her work into a new musical dimension with the award-winning London Road. It was only when then NT director Nicholas Hytner said he wouldn’t produce a play with actors using earphones that she took the leap of abandoning them midway through rehearsals. Dealing with the aftermath of a string of serial killings in the Ipswich area in the 00s, this collaboration with composer Adam Cork was later made into a film. It worked the hesitations into astonishingly effective repeating choruses: “Everyone is very very nervous … UM … and very unsure of everything … BASICALLY.” The Guardian’s Michael Billington was among those who saluted London Road as fresh and revelatory. “Conventional musicals, even at their best, take us into a world of fantasy,” he wrote. “This miraculously innovative show finds a new way of representing reality.” Though Our Generation isn’t a musical, Evans was chosen to direct it because of his musicality. He is also artistic director of Chichester Festival theatre, which became a partner in the production, and will stage the show immediately after the NT. What was it that piqued his interest? “Well, I’ve been in some musicals, and I’ve directed some musicals,” he says, with an understatement that sends Blythe into a peal of laughter. As an actor, he is one of the UK’s most successful Sondheim specialists, winning Oliviers for his roles in both Merrily We Roll Along and Sunday in the Park With George. As a director, he has demonstrated a populist flair, with award-winning productions ranging from Oliver! and My Fair Lady to The Full Monty. “And I’m Welsh,” he says. “I think the Welsh bit is important. People always bang on about the tune of our accent, so I grew up with an awareness of how I sound, and this has taken it to a whole new level.” He takes a particular pride in some of the language the play’s two characters from north Wales come up with. “What, you mean the ‘My nails are longer than my future’ line?” asks Blythe. “Well there’s that,” replies Evans, before soaring off into a sentence so gloriously filthy it’s unprintable. “It’s just how language is relished unconsciously by people,” he says. “It’s very, very sensuous, I think, without them even knowing that they’re being sensuous.” Their vivacity, Evans points out, is all the more impressive from a generation growing up after decades of cuts, which mean they wouldn’t have the chance he had, as a talented child actor from the south Wales valleys, to have music and drama classes financed by the local authority. “There’s a character towards the end of the play,” he adds, sadly, “who says, ‘We’ve been left in the rubble.’” Blythe is acutely aware of her responsibilities to her young interviewees, who were all invited with their families to a taster preview on the understanding that anything they felt uncomfortable with would get the chop. “It’s really important to make sure that we are representing them as truthfully as possible, because they’ve been so generous as to give us a portion of their lives,” she says. It says something about the rapport developed between interviewees and collectors that only one interviewee dropped out over the five years, even though some of them found themselves dealing with disappointments and traumas they could never have anticipated. But it’s not all hardship. “There are others who are succeeding in sports and in academia in an immense way,” points out Evans. “Plus there’s romance,” adds Blythe. “You know, falling in love, falling out of love. Sex. Yeah. Drugs. Yes. What is remarkable about this group of people is that, despite everything, they still have hope.”  Our Generation is at the National Theatre, London, 14 February to 9 April and at Chichester Festival theatre 22 April to 14 May.",Arts/Stage,"‘My nails are longer than my future’: Our Generation, the 254-scene play about teens, cuts and Covid",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/08/alecky-blythe-future-our-generation-254-scene-play-teens-cuts-and-covid
2/8/2022,"It is hard to imagine a Tory government even five years ago promising to “end the geographical inequality that is such a striking feature of the UK”. In Philip Hammond’s 2016 “northern powerhouse” strategy, the word “inequality” did not appear once. But there it is in the government’s levelling-up paper, released last week, mentioned no less than 35 times. Buried in the 300 pages, we find an argument that “market forces” cannot simply be “left to their own devices”, and even an admission that the “wrenching structural changes” of the Margaret Thatcher years “caused large and lasting economic damage to significant parts of the UK”.  But old habits die hard. The paper acknowledges – implicitly and occasionally explicitly – that the UK’s growth model is broken, failing to spread prosperity evenly among people and places. Yet it fails to pursue this reasoning to its logical conclusion, and is thus left trying to solve these problems using the same thinking that created them in the first place. Apparently, levelling up is “about growing the economic pie, everywhere and for everyone, not re-slicing it”. Or, in other words, about having our pie and eating it too. The prescription for areas that are “lagging behind” London and the south-east is depressingly familiar; it’s the same prescription that has shaped cities such as Manchester, where I live, over the past decade. In brief, the government will attract inward investment by private capital in leading-edge, hi-tech sectors and upgraded infrastructure. This will create growth and boost productivity, generating plenty of high-skill jobs and triggering a “virtuous circle” of agglomeration. There’s just one problem with this: it doesn’t boost living standards “everywhere and for everyone”. It doesn’t work for exactly the same reason that soaring GDP in London hasn’t benefited the rest of the country, or even most Londoners. It doesn’t work because great wealth in a few hands does not trickle down. Hi-tech sectors such as life sciences and advanced materials have helped drive gentrification in Manchester city centre, while outlying towns such as Bolton and Wigan continue to be hollowed out. Meanwhile, neither the jobs created in these sectors nor the shiny flats that have popped up around them are accessible to people in deprived inner-city areas such as Moss Side. To its credit, Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) has recognised the problem, creating an independent inequalities commission to tackle it. The commission recommended that GMCA refocus its economic strategy on achieving “good lives for all”, not just growth and productivity. But, despite central government’s dizzying array of new “missions”, it doesn’t seem to have got the memo. The levelling-up white paper ponders “why measures of quality of life are often lowest in otherwise well-performing areas of the UK, such as London”, but doesn’t pause to ask what on earth it can possibly mean for an area to be “well performing”, if it is not about better lives for the people who call it home. The answer, of course, is that “well performing” simply means that someone, somewhere is making a lot of money. In London, this is largely driven by an oversized financial sector and an overheated property market – both of which have been shown to have adverse effects on the wider economy. The idea that it is either possible or desirable for every part of the country to be “levelled up” to the status of London is pie in the sky. But the very phrase “levelling up” is based on precisely this fallacy. It soothingly reassures Conservative donors that their wealth and power will not be threatened by this agenda. Instead, we will simply raise everyone else up to the same dizzying heights. In reality, we can’t all be billionaires. This leaves the government with little to say to underpaid workers in “everyday economy” sectors such as retail, hospitality and care. This is perhaps not surprising, since most of the things required to improve these workers’ incomes are anathema to the Tories: securing workplace rights, properly funding childcare and social care, and tackling the extractive ownership models which suck billions out of the system every year. Much easier to repeat tired platitudes about higher productivity being a surefire route to higher wages – a claim that the New Economics Foundation debunked last week. These workers are not failing to prosper because they are not productive enough: the problem is that they are not powerful enough. At the other end of the scale, the notion that we can all be economic winners conveniently ignores the fact that some of our economy’s biggest winners are gaining at the direct expense of somebody else. They are, as geographer Brett Christophers has pointed out, “rentiers”. Like landlords, they extract rents by controlling valuable assets, be that homes, essential infrastructure, or natural resources like oil and gas. They are not outstandingly wealthy because they are outstandingly productive, but because the value of their assets keeps on climbing – contributing to rising costs of living for the rest of us. London is the death star of this model of capitalism, which is etched in the skyline of Canary Wharf’s skyscrapers and Kensington’s luxury flats. It has been propped up through the pandemic by measures such as quantitative easing and stamp duty holidays. Once again, the white paper seems more apt to replicate this model than to challenge it. We are promised “transformational developments” of housing, shops and businesses in 20 towns and cities, but nothing is said about who will own these developments or who will benefit. If the government was serious about doing things differently, it might have looked to Preston, whose much-celebrated “community wealth building” model was sparked by the collapse of just such a development. Instead, it simply promises to repatriate government spending to UK firms – reducing community wealth-building to a sort of performative nationalism. It might even have looked to inspiring experiments in London itself, such as the proposed community-led redevelopment of the Latin Village in Seven Sisters, north London – recently endorsed by the council after a major developer pulled out – for fresh thinking on how to build “beautiful new neighbourhoods” that empower people rather than exclude them. If “levelling up” is to mean anything, it has to be the start of a national debate about who does well in the UK economy and how we can rewire it to spread prosperity more fairly. Without this, all that will be levelled up are the profit margins of a select few.

2/8/2022,"PFAS are a family of thousands of human-made substances – nicknamed “forever chemicals” because they do not break down in the environment – that have been widely used since the 1940s in a huge range of everyday consumer products and industrial processes. Valued for their nonstick and stain-repellent properties, they can be found in food packaging, cosmetics, cookware, waterproof clothing, carpets, mattresses, electronics and fire-fighting foams. In industry, they are used in processes such as metal finishing and plating, hydraulic fluids and semiconductor manufacturing.  Uses of just two of the substances – PFOS and PFOA – have been banned or restricted because of their toxic, persistent and bioaccumulative effects, but there are concerns about others on which there is less toxicity evidence available because they have been less studied. The chemicals have a relatively low profile in the UK, but in the US PFAS has become a household term. The devastating impacts of PFOA was first exposed by US lawyer Rob Bilott who has been fighting for decades on behalf of people exposed to the chemicals. His David and Goliath struggle to prove that DuPont, which was using PFOA in the manufacture of Teflon, had poisoned drinking water with PFOA, and that PFOA manufacturers had long known about its toxic effects, was portrayed by Mark Ruffalo in the 2019 film Dark Waters. Bilott’s work led to an enormous epidemiological study of 69,000 people, which linked PFOA to a range of diseases, including kidney and testicular cancer. His class actions have led to settlements of about $753m to date and have spawned similar legal cases across the world, including in Australia where PFOS from firefighting foam used at defence bases has made it into water used by a number of towns. No longer able to ignore the issue, in the US, the Environmental Protection Agency has created a list of more than 120,000 locations where people may be exposed to PFAS. In Europe, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden have signalled their intention to ban the manufacture of PFAS, most of their uses and their placement on the EU market.",News/Environment,‘Forever chemicals’: what are PFAS and what risk do they pose?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/08/what-are-pfas-forever-chemicals-what-risk-toxicity
2/8/2022,"Australian consular officials have been denied access to a dual Australian-Chinese citizen detained in Hong Kong for 11 months for alleged “subversion”. The Australian government – which has had an increasingly strained relationship with Beijing – renewed its concerns about “the erosion of basic freedoms and autonomy in Hong Kong” under the territory’s broadly worded national security law.  The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has disclosed new details about the case of a dual Australian-Chinese citizen detained in Hong Kong under that law, after officials had previously said the person was “subsequently released”. The man, born in Hong Kong, was first arrested on 6 January 2021 “for conspiring to subvert state power” and was released on bail the following day, Dfat said in a written response to a parliamentary question. “On 28 February 2021 Hong Kong police advised the individual that he was to be charged for ‘subversion’ and was required to attend West Kowloon magistrates’ court on 1 March 2021, where he was again placed under arrest. “The individual remains in detention.” That timeline means the man has been in detention for the past 11 months. The new details were first reported on Tuesday by the ABC, which notes the man faces a potential jail term ranging from 10 years to life if convicted of subversion. The Australian government has not confirmed his name. Hong Kong authorities first notified the Australian consulate general in Hong Kong of the arrest in January 2021, although China does not recognise dual nationality. “Officials from our consulate general have attended the subsequent court hearings,” a spokesperson for Dfat said on Tuesday. “However, we have been denied consular access despite multiple attempts because the individual is deemed to be a Chinese citizen under China’s citizenship laws, which do not recognise dual nationality.” Australia’s bilateral consular agreement with China, including Hong Kong, only allows access to Australian citizens who entered on an Australian passport. Dfat was “in regular contact” with the man’s lawyers and would “continue to attend future court hearings”, the spokesperson said. “Australia and many other countries have expressed concern about the erosion of basic freedoms and autonomy in Hong Kong and have called on Hong Kong and Chinese authorities to abide by their human rights obligations,” they said. “The Hong Kong National Security Law could be interpreted broadly and therefore result in detention that is arbitrary or lacks transparency as well as the removal of basic individual rights.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Beijing imposed the sweeping national security law in Hong Kong in mid-2020 in response to months of pro-democracy protests in 2019, sparking accusations from western nations that China was undermining rights and freedoms it guaranteed as part of the handover from the UK. The independent South Australian senator Rex Patrick, who first asked about the matter in Senate estimates in October, said he held “grave concerns for this individual, along with the others being held in arbitrary detention by the Chinese Communist Party”. “His arrest highlights the plight of the more than 100 Hongkongers that have been arrested and charged since the CCP repression of Hong Kong began,” Patrick said. Elaine Pearson, the Australia director of Human Rights Watch, said on Tuesday the latest case was “worrying”. “Hong Kong’s draconian national security law is a roadmap for repression – it criminalises all sorts of peaceful activism and criticism that is usually unremarkable in a democracy,” Pearson said. “We are deeply concerned about every person being prosecuted under the national security law, and it’s worrying to see even an Australian dual citizen is facing charges of ‘subversion’.” Pearson called on the Australian government to work closely with other concerned governments “to publicly denounce the national security law and advocate strongly for the release of all those who are arbitrarily detained”. In December, authorities arrested Cantopop star Denise Ho – who is also a Canadian citizen – in a raid on reporters and prominent figures linked to the Hong Kong media outlet StandNews. That matter involves allegations of conspiracy to “publish seditious materials” in Ho’s role as a former director of the independent news provider. Hong Kong’s security bureau declined to comment on individual cases, but told the ABC Chinese nationals were “not normally entitled to consular protection” in the territory “on account of their holding a foreign travel document”. It added: “Western countries such as Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand, etc. have all enacted laws to safeguard their respective national security.” The Chinese embassy in Canberra was also contacted for comment. China is particularly sensitive about criticism related to Hong Kong and Taiwan, the latter of which is a self-governed democracy of 24 million people but which Beijing claims as its territory. In December the Chinese embassy accused the Australian government of “violently interfering” in its internal affairs. That broadside came after Australia joined with its Five Eyes allies to voice grave concerns about the “erosion of democratic elements” and elimination of “any meaningful political opposition” in Hong Kong.",News/World news,Australia denied access to dual citizen detained for alleged ‘subversion’ in Hong Kong,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/08/australia-denied-access-to-dual-citizen-detained-for-alleged-subversion-in-hong-kong
2/8/2022,"Australia’s mean temperature last year was 0.56C warmer than the long-term average despite 2021 being the country’s coolest year in a decade. It was a year of contrasting weather and climate conditions, the Bureau of Meteorology said in its annual climate statement, with long-running heatwaves in northern Australia and widespread flooding in eastern states, in part due to a La Niña event.  In the west, severe tropical cyclone Seroja was the southernmost tropical cyclone to make landfall since the 1950s. Averaged across the continent, last year was Australia’s 19th warmest year on record. Mean annual maximum and minimum temperatures were above average for most of northern Australia, Tasmania, and parts of the west coast, but temperatures were cooler than average for parts of inland New South Wales and central Australia. “Although 2021 was Australia’s coolest year since 2012, temperatures were still much warmer than the historical average,” said climatologist Jonathon Pollock. “In fact, of all the years on record prior to the year 2000, only five were warmer than 2021.” The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last year reported that Australian land areas were on average 1.4C hotter than early last century, and warming was unequivocally due to human influence. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The country had its wettest November on record in 2021 and across the year experienced its highest rainfall levels since 2016. Nationally averaged rainfall was 9% above the 1961–1990 average, with 509.7mm. For much of Australia the amount of rainfall was above average compared to all years since 1900. The wetter weather was influenced by several climate drivers, including La Niña, which persisted through the 2020-21 summer and emerged again in November. A negative Indian Ocean dipole in winter and spring fuelled above-average winter–spring rainfall over parts of southern Australia, compared to the distribution of rainfall across all years since 1900. “Two years in a row of above average rainfall meant by the end of 2021, and for the first time in five years, no large parts of the country were in meteorological drought,” said Pollock. He said major water storages across eastern Australia had recorded significant increases. In western NSW, the Menindee Lakes filled for the first time since 2012. There were some exceptions, however. The most significant was in south-east Queensland, where water storages have remained low.",News/Australia news,"Australia’s coolest year in a decade still warmer than average, Bureau of Meteorology reports",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/08/australias-coolest-year-in-a-decade-still-warmer-than-average-bureau-of-meteorology-reports
2/8/2022,"When winter has settled into the bones, not a sound carrying over the stones, into the silence of earth and frost – a tiny, tinkling goldcrest drops. Along with the firecrest, it is the UK’s smallest bird, flickering through bark in busy bursts. Weighing about the same as a 20p piece, it can be hard to spot high in fir and pine trees. Yet, when you catch sight of the gold-striped head, it is not the kind of light you forget. The yellow or orange crown gleams, flooding the bark with its golden stream. Where I stand in the field by a border of pines, the ground encrusted with a rust of ice, a pair dash in and out of sight – bright sparks flying as the trees ignite. With counts slightly lower this winter, it is especially reassuring to see them. I catch one’s eye – gleaming, wild – then watch the small run of its beak and feel the tingling release. Notes so high-pitched that they’re inaudible to some strum like sunbeams across the leaves. If sunlight could be heard, perhaps it would be this – I tilt my head back to its golden pitch. Ears shift into higher frequencies for its contact call of “zree-zree-zree”.  With their small size, lighter, on average, even than the firecrest, goldcrests can use up a lot of their energy to keep warm – on cold nights, up to 20% of their body weight. But as the notes flow between us, the coldness goes. The gold seems to find its way into the bones. There is, everywhere, a warming current. Waves of sound splash upon us. The colour begins to return to my cheeks as I stand in the glow. Yellow drips down from branch to branch as the birds continue their glistening advance. Despite their small size, their impact is huge. I am held by the spectacle and cannot move. Through lit peals, their chime resounds, tolling the days through to warmer ground. Their presence, even now, delivers an ease, a heat that pours steadily down through the trees. The earth, the leaves and treetops thaw, and winter, for just a moment, withdraws.
