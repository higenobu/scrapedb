2/4/2022,"Barnaby Joyce labelled Scott Morrison “a hypocrite and a liar” in a private text message, sent before he returned to the leadership of the National party. In another blow for the embattled prime minister, the leaked text, seen by Guardian Australia, was forwarded to the former Liberal staffer Brittany Higgins by a third party.  In it, Joyce said he did not “get along” with Morrison. “He is a hypocrite and a liar from my observations and that is over a long time,” Joyce said in the message, dated March last year. “I have never trusted him, and I dislike how earnestly [he] rearranges the truth to a lie.” Joyce’s attack is the second time in a week private text exchanges, critical of the prime minister, have been leaked. On Tuesday, Morrison was blindsided when the Ten Network’s political editor, Peter van Onselen, used a televised question and answer session at the National Press Club to reveal private criticism of Morrison. Van Onselen told Morrison he had a record of a text message exchange between a party colleague and the former New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian in which she branded the prime minister a “horrible person” who was untrustworthy. “The minister is even more scathing, describing you as a fraud and ‘a complete psycho’,” Van Onselen said. “Does this exchange surprise you? And what does it tell us?” Van Onselen later said the conversation was between Berejiklian and a federal minister. The prime minister’s office confirmed in a statement on Friday night that Joyce had approached Morrison earlier this week to inform him of the critical text messages sent when he was on the backbench. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Joyce returned to the Nationals leadership in July 2021 after toppling Michael McCormack in a leadership spill. At the time, he said he returned to lead the Nationals a “better person” after spending three years on the backbench. In a statement, Morrison said after telling him about the messages, Joyce “sincerely apologised and I immediately accepted his apology in good faith”. “I understand Barnaby was in a different headspace last year, both professionally and personally, and so I know he genuinely no longer feels this way. Relationships change over time. Politicians are humans beings too. We all have our frailties and none of us are perfect. “Since coming to the role of deputy prime minister, it is fair to say that we both positively surprised each other. We were never close before this and never pretended to be. But in these roles we have really found our rhythm, as we have concluded Aukus, settled our climate change policy and continued to fight the pandemic.” In a separate statement, Joyce said: “In the last 24 hours I have become aware that a screenshot of a text message has been circulating among third-parties that contains comments I made in March 2021 when I was a backbencher. “While the text message was supposed to be private, what I said in that message was wrong; and I have unreservedly apologised to the prime minister for my comments,” the deputy prime minister said. “It is common knowledge that in the past the prime minister and I had not always seen eye to eye. But I have worked extremely closely with the prime minister over the last seven months since I returned to the role of deputy prime minister; and the prime minister is a person of high integrity and honesty in what is possibly the most difficult job in the nation.” Earlier in the week, Joyce had blasted the anonymous critic of Morrison and urged the person to reveal their identity. “I would suggest that if you know anything about this don’t wait to be outed,” Joyce told reporters on Wednesday. “And give an explanation. Maybe it was a bad day in the office, I don’t know. That’s a better way to do it. It getting out is one good rump steak, with horseradish sauce, vegetables and chips, two bottles of red wine, and some journo is going to say ‘You know who told me that?

When asked if his office would investigate the leak he replied: “I’m not fussed.” The revelation of the text message from Joyce caps off a difficult week for the prime minister. Morrison had hoped his speech to the National Press Club would be a political reset after a difficult summer battling the Omicron variant – but that outing was overshadowed by the text exchange, and an ensuing 48 hours where cabinet colleagues lined up to deny they had made the criticism. Federal parliament returns next week, and Morrison plans to call an election after the government has delivered a budget in March. Published opinion polls suggest Labor would defeat the Morrison government if an election were held today.",News/Australia news,Barnaby Joyce called Scott Morrison ‘a hypocrite and a liar’ in leaked text message,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/04/barnaby-joyce-called-scott-morrison-a-hypocrite-and-a-liar-in-leaked-text-message
2/4/2022,"There are many wonderful things about The Book of Boba Fett, Disney+’s new TV show about the bounty hunter who was first introduced in George Lucas’s original Star Wars trilogy. Unfortunately, the title character is not one of them. Which makes it a strange viewing experience, and one that should make fans question their abiding fascination for the jetpack-sporting killer-for-hire. We’ve had the return of Timothy Olyphant’s Cobb Vanth, a space cowboy to rival even Pedro Pascal’s Din Djarin for sharp-shooting insouciance. There’s that dark, black-eyed Wookiee, who has to be the most terrifying thing seen in Star Wars since it was revealed Jar Bar Binks had been elected to the Galactic Senate. In the most recent episode we got nearly 20 minutes of Luke Skywalker teaching Baby Yoda Jedi skills, while chatting casually to the incredible Rosario Dawson’s Ahsoka Tano. Geek heads duly spun right off shoulders. Was that the new Jedi temple all those multi-limbed robots were building? Do the Sand People really have personalities? What on Tatooine does the Hutts’ home planet look like? OMG is that Cad Bane from the Clone Wars show, realised in live action? The good stuff has been pretty much never-ending.  The show’s problem is Boba himself, as essayed by Temuera Morrison. Star Wars fans had been waiting more than 40 years to find out who the enigmatic bounty hunter really is under the Mandalorian armour (that appearance as a kid in the prequels doesn’t really count) only to now rather wish he’d kept it on. Is this really the same guy we saw in The Empire Strikes Back, and briefly in Return of the Jedi? The taciturn figure who inspired a thousand dodgy fan-fic efforts and a decades-long campaign to give him his own movie or TV show? The Book of Boba Fett makes us wonder why we got so excited about Lucas’s creation in the first place. It turns out his armour really was the most intriguing thing about him: a triumph of remarkable costume design; of style over substance. On this basis, why are we not seeing Disney+ shows about Gwendoline Christie’s Captain Phasma, whose battle-threads were surely equally cool, or Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren? Boba’s other interesting characteristic, his bounty hunting creed, was already explored in The Mandalorian. We’ve seen Din Djarin’s people slowly reimagined as the yin to the Jedi yang; a culture that prides itself on sticking to the rules but also values interpersonal connections and loyalty to one’s companions. Boba, on the other hand, was reintroduced with the revelation that his Mandalorian armour was most likely stolen by his clone daddy decades ago, and that he has little to do with the creed other than this. He has, effectively, been an impostor for the best part of half a century. Maybe the final episode of Boba Fett will set everything to rights. Perhaps there is some fabulous finale waiting for us in which all parties come together for a giant hurrah of laser-fire and lightsabers. Maybe Baby Yoda learned to jump-spin like Sonic the Hedgehog just in time to save Din Djarin from certain death at the hands of the twisted-looking Bane. Perhaps those Hutt twins are going to be dumped on dark Wookiee’s head from a great height. Maybe Ahsoka Tano slices and dices Jabba’s green pig monsters like slimy sweet and sour pork. Who knows, and who cares? The fact that we can’t really imagine Boba being anything other than a bystander at the centre of the final episode’s geeky sweet spots tells us everything we need to know about this character. He’s become Star Wars’s equivalent of Hawkeye – though at least Marvel had the nous to give us 20+ movies and half a dozen TV shows before finally getting to the eternally superfluous sharp-shooting superhero. Forty years after Boba Fett first turned our heads, most of us probably wish they’d given it at least the same again before he finally took off his helmet.",Arts/Film,The Book of Boba Fett: has it ruined the character’s Star Wars legacy?,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/04/the-book-of-boba-fett-wrecked-star-wars-coolest-character-mandalorian
2/4/2022,"“An impassioned protest against death,” is how Shostakovich described his Fourteenth Symphony. Written at speed in 1969 when the composer was in hospital in Moscow after his second heart attack, you could argue that it represents music’s most disquieting confrontation with mortality. Part symphony, part song cycle for soprano and bass soloists, strings and percussion, it’s an unremittingly bleak piece that sets 11 poems about untimely death by poets who themselves died young. There’s little attempt to console, no suggestion of transcendence, only a numbing and pervasive sense of finality. For some, it is Shostakovich’s greatest score, though the emotional demands it makes on audiences and performers alike can make it uncomfortable listening. Gianandrea Noseda’s performance with the London Symphony Orchestra, part of a current Shostakovich cycle, was typically uncompromising: a deeply unsettling exploration of a desiccated sound-world that eerily hovers at the limits of existence. Restraint and violence were garishly juxtaposed. String phrases seemed to echo across distances and abysses, and skeletal xylophone taps ushered death into taverns and on to battlefields.  The soloists, superbly matched, were Elena Stikhina and Vitalij Kowaljow, their singing hovering between lyricism and expressionism. The gabbled colloquy between the suicidal Lorelei and the bishop who desires her was deeply unnerving. Kowaljow’s deliberately bleached tone spoke volumes in the opening depiction of the mass graves of dead lovers, while the extraordinary beauty of Stikhina’s voice offset the bitter ironies of Waiting and the sheer horror of The Suicide. Its companion piece was Beethoven’s Seventh, the absolute antithesis of the Shostakovich in every way, a celebration of life and vitality that embraces Dionysian extremes of elation and joy. Noseda propelled the score forward with seemingly boundless energy, pressing urgently through the slow movement where some conductors are apt to hold back. The sheer exhilaration of the finale occasionally came at the price of textural clarity, but elsewhere the playing was beautifully focused, the all-important woodwind solos elegantly honed.",Arts/Music,LSO/Noseda review – uncompromising Shostakovich and exhilarating Beethoven,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/04/lso-gianandrea-noseda-review-shostakovich-beethoven-barbican
2/4/2022,"It was 40 years ago that choreographer Pina Bausch first brought Kontakthof to London (it was made in 1978) and yet its subject matter hasn’t aged a bit. Its themes centre on the endless miseries of mating, gender wars and sexual mores as well as the irritations, humiliations and pain we inflict on each other in our struggle to connect and make physical contact. The pursuit, judgment and abuse of women is ever present, too. The late Bausch was sharp in her commentary and clever in her execution. A cast of 22 populate a dull dance hall, in suits and brightly coloured silk dresses and stilettos. To the gramophone crackle of a 1930s tango, they offer themselves up for examination – teeth, face, posture – and proceed in formation across the stage, knowingly on display.  Bausch exposes private actions under stark lights, and gives physical form to psychological needling, having couples bend each other’s fingers back, tug earlobes or flick noses. But she also shows why we go to the trouble: a man holds up his hands, then a woman slips her face in between them, perfectly fitting the gap like Cinderella’s slipper. Kontakthof has bitterness, regret, moments of tenderness and brutality, but plenty of humour, too. The problem is, at three hours long, Bausch never knew when to stop. For some, that’s the point. Don’t humans go on repeating their strange behaviour endlessly year after year? Much like Peter Jackson’s epic Beatles doc Get Back, arguably you have to become immersed in the world, and from repeated riffs emerge something simple, brilliant and true. Alternatively, you could say Bausch was just terrible at killing her darlings. In 2010, Tanztheater Wuppertal performed Kontakthof in London with different casts: one made up of teenagers, one of dancers over 65, and that was revelatory, seeing the anxieties and excitement of youthful encounters, and unseen intimacies of older people. This original version is lacking by comparison, even though the cast is strong, a rich gathering of individuals, with Canadian Emma Barrowman by turns sexy, cutesy, dominant and playfully teasing in the central role.

2/4/2022,"The governor of the Bank of England has said workers should show restraint when asking for wage rises to help control inflation. Andrew Bailey said he wanted to see “quite clear restraint” in the annual wage-bargaining process between staff and their employers to help prevent an upward spiral taking hold.  With households expected to face the worst annual fall in their living standards for three decades, he told the BBC’s Today programme that controlling wage increases was key to keeping a grip on inflation. “I’m not saying nobody gets a pay rise, don’t get me wrong. But what I am saying is, we do need to see restraint in pay bargaining, otherwise it will get out of control,” he said. The governor’s comments drew a sharp response from trade unions, with workers expected to face a drop in their incomes this year. Gary Smith, the general secretary of the GMB trade union, said Bailey’s comments were a “sick joke”. He said: “The nerve of Mr Bailey is scarcely credible. Telling the hard-working people who carried this country through the pandemic they don’t deserve a pay rise is outrageous.” Bailey was paid £575,538, including pension, in his first year as the Bank’s governor from March 2020, more than 18 times higher than the £31,285 median annual pay for full-time employees in the UK. Union density in the private sector has fallen steadily since the 1970s, when high rates of inflation were fuelled by high pay settlements, to about 13%. Official figures show average weekly earnings after taking account of inflation fell in November, and remain below their pre-2008 financial crisis peak. Kate Bell, the head of economics at the TUC, said inflation was being driven by rising energy costs, not pay demands. “Working people need a pay rise now. And the best way to get one is to join a union,” she said. The Bank raised interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% on Thursday, adding to borrowing costs for consumers and businesses in a move designed to keep a lid on high rates of inflation. The central bank warned inflation could rise from the current rate of 5.4% to a peak of about 7.25% by April amid an increase in energy costs, more than three times its 2% target rate. High rates of inflation are being driven up by record prices on wholesale energy markets and disruption to global manufacturing and supply chains because of Covid-19. Official figures show wage growth has fallen in recent months close to average pre-pandemic levels. However, the Bank said it forecast wage growth would pick up to about 5% later this year amid record numbers of job vacancies and low rates of unemployment. After the worst decade during the 2010s for average pay growth since the Napoleonic wars, the Bank forecasts disposable incomes are on track to shrink by 2% this year, the biggest drop since comparable records began in 1990. The governor’s call for pay restraint comes after Boris Johnson said in the autumn he wanted to turn Britain into a high-wage, high-skill economy, and criticised company bosses for wanting to bring in cheaper workers from the EU.",News/Business,Bank of England boss calls for wage restraint to help control inflation,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/04/bank-of-england-boss-calls-for-wage-restraint-to-help-control-inflation
2/4/2022,"A coalition of climate, environmental and animal welfare groups is calling for California to remove the huge subsidies provided to dairy farms to turn animal waste into a form of energy called biogas. Manure, which emits the potent greenhouse gas methane, is a big problem for US farms, and is particularly stark in California, where the dairy industry accounts for nearly half the state’s methane emissions.  Since 2011, California has been running a policy called the low carbon fuel standard (LCFS), which now includes incentives for dairy farms to convert methane into energy to fuel vehicles by enabling them to sell offset credits. This is intended to be a win-win: reducing farm emissions while allowing fossil fuel companies to mitigate their own greenhouse gas emissions by buying these offsets. The number of anaerobic digesters used to produce the biogas has surged in the state especially among large dairy farms. But environmental advocates argue that the environmental benefits of biogas are exaggerated, and that the LCFS encourages the expansion of factory farms and could end up increasing emissions and pollution. In a petition to the California Air Resources Board (Carb), the state government’s clean air agency that runs the LCFS, six environmental groups called for dairy farms to be excluded from the policy. In January, Carb turned down the request but said it would continue to engage with the petitioners. This decision will “kick the can down the road [and] ensures that the program will remain fundamentally compromised and California will fall further behind its climate goals,” said Tyler Lobdell, a staff attorney with Food & Water Watch, one of the organizations involved in the petition. While biogas from manure is marketed as a clean alternative to fossil fuel, said Phoebe Seaton, co-director and attorney at the non-profit Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability, a signatory to the petition, “in fact it burns the same, has many of the same environmental impacts and has enormous local impacts at its production”. Under the current credit system in California, biogas from dairy farms can receive carbon intensity ratings that are 200% to 300% lower than a battery electric car powered by renewable energy from solar or wind. “That is a really stark example of the bizarre and perverse incentives that are being driven by this program,” Lobdell said. “Who in their right mind thinks that we should be prioritizing factory farm gas, which is still a combustion-based energy source?” Brent Newell, a food project senior attorney at the legal advocacy non-profit Public Justice, cited the Aliso Canyon natural gas leak settlement in California, as an example of problems with the credit program. In 2015, a ruptured well at Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility caused the US’s largest ever methane leak. As part of a settlement, the owner of the facility, Southern California Gas Company, agreed to pay more than $26m towards the construction of digesters at dairy farms. “These facilities are getting money from the Aliso Canyon settlement fund, they’re getting money from the state, and under both of those systems, they’re getting credit for reducing the same reductions twice, then they’re selling reduction credits in the market,” said Newell. Without government subsidies and grants, digesters may not be profitable according to an analysis conducted by UC Davis researchers, which found that it costs $294 a year to produce $68 of gas from one cow, excluding the upfront cost of building the digester. With LCFS credits, the revenue loss is turned on its head: one cow generates a subsidy of $1,935 a year, according to analysis by Aaron Smith, DeLoach professor of agricultural economics at UC Davis. The global biogas industry is projected to more than double by 2030 to over $126.2bn and this type of methane production could become more lucrative in the dairy industry than milk production. California has spent more than $600m since 2015 on subsidizing the construction of digesters, primarily at large factory farms with average herds of about 7,000 cows in 2017 and 2018. The Union of Concerned Scientists has criticized dairy biogas subsidies as “excessive” and vastly exceeding the costs of producing methane from manure. An analysis by the organization indicated that the LCFS will also disproportionately benefit the largest, most polluting dairy farms, potentially increasing industry consolidation as well as disincentivizing other methods of reducing methane emissions. “The revenue from the low carbon fuel standard-related subsidies is actually driving this ongoing intensification of the dairy industry and intensifies local impacts,” said Seaton. Large dairy operations have been linked to water pollution, air pollution, and health problems for residents in communities where these operations are concentrated, in addition to emissions contributing to the climate crisis. “We would not be processing biogas and using it as a replacement for fossil natural gas without these subsidies,” said Smith. In response to the criticisms of the LCFS credit system, Carb, said the agency was “committed to ensuring our program focuses on environmental justice and environmental integrity” but that “specific requests for a near-term rulemaking are premature”. A Carb spokesperson added that there would be a public workshop in the coming weeks to delve into claims regarding the LCFS program and its impact on the dairy sector.",News/Environment,"California subsidies for dairy cows’ biogas are a lose-lose, campaigners say",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/04/california-subsidies-biogas-dairy-cows-emissions-climate

2/4/2022,"During the spring lockdown in 2020, Christopher Sloman was walking down a street in Hove when he saw what looked like a green dinosaur looming towards him. The 48-year-old charity shop worker was baffled by the figure in the distance – until he realised it was a woman whose coat was so oversized that her hands (one carrying a phone, the other a coffee) “looked really small,” Sloman says. “I thought: My God, what on earth is that?” “That” turned out to be a Dryrobe – the £160 ankle-length, waterproof robe designed as an outdoor changing robe for surfers in 2010 which has become the go-to piece of kit for any half-serious outdoor swimmer.  If cold swimming became the pandemic’s Olympic sport – and an increase of 50% and more of cold-water swimmers as reported by the Outdoor Swimming Society (OSS) suggests it has – then Dryrobes were its uniform. With its towelled interior designed to help the sea-soaked get dry, the robe is oversized so you can get changed underneath it, pulling your arms inside to take off your swimwear without flashing – and many find it coat-like enough to wear home. Slowly but surely though, as we spent more time not simply in cold ponds but outdoors in general, Dryrobes began migrating inland. On his Instagram page @dry_robe_count, Sloman has spent the last year documenting Dryrobes where Dryrobes were not designed to be. There’s the woman in the supermarket; the mum on the school run; the man in the cafe; Russell Brand in a field of sheep. Elise Wilkins, a 28-year-old Brighton resident who runs the similar page, @DoYouOwnACoat, believes Dryrobes are favoured by the middle-aged and the middle class. “It’s a status symbol,” she says. Though she swims herself, Wilkins laughs when asked if she’d ever get one. “Oh my God! I can’t afford it!” Beyond Brighton, the fashion world has also taken notice of the robe. Grazia magazine has branded Dryrobes “the must-have, all-season coat” – while Amy de Klerk, digital fashion editor of Harper’s Bazaar, says Dryrobes remind her of the “comically oversized Balenciaga coats” that hit the runway in 2018. One particular Dryrobe may have played a part. You can get them in blue, black, red and purple, but the most eyecatching is a camo number with a hot-pink fluffy interior. While company founder Gideon Bright says sales are even across each colour (and customers in general are “an equal split of men and women”), the camo-pink combo is the Dryrobe that most often gets papped on Instagram pages such as Sloman’s. They don’t just stand out – Sloman thinks that people wearing them want to stand out. How and why did a speciality surfing robe become a fashion statement, and how did it come to inspire, if not an all-out culture war, at least a culture tiff? In November 2020, a laminated sign appeared on a lamppost in Sandycove, Ireland: “By order” read big bold letters: “No Dryrobe or Dryrobe types!!!”. When another sign sprang up in nearby Blackrock, warning to “beware of Dryrobe wankers”, a counter-revolution began, with “types” creating the “I am Spartacus”-esque solidarity hashtag #dryrobewankers. It has taken 12 years for Dryrobe to reach this point. It started, the tidy marketing story goes, when Bright’s mum sewed him a cape. Bright is a 54-year-old dad from north Devon who has surfed from a young age – when he was 16, his mum made him a waterproof robe with a towel lining and a hood so he could stay warm and change more easily on the beach. Years later, he improved on the prototype in his shed, selling the first official Dryrobe in December 2010. In 2012, production moved to China, and in 2016 the brand partnered with Adidas to produce Team GB Dryrobes for Olympic swimmers and divers. By last summer, Dryrobes had appeared in Vogue, newspaper style pages and on Rita Ora. Today, runners, mountain bikers and campers swear by Dryrobes, though Bright says the company didn’t actively market to other hobbyists: “It just spread naturally into other activities as people discovered how useful it can be.” Bright didn’t suddenly decide to invest millions of pounds to ensure Dryrobe took over the streets. No, it turns out that That Thing That Changed Everything in 2020 even changed the popularity of towelled robes. Anna Deacon, author of Taking the Plunge and The Art of Wild Swimming, says the popularity of wild swimming went “crackers” thanks to Covid-19 lockdowns. Her local wild swimming Facebook group went from 40-50 swimmers to 2,500. There are now a number of similar robes available, part of a growing category of post-swimwear. You can buy post-swimming robes from Shore, Robie and Mountain Warehouse. In 2020, two wild swimmers created Wylding, a £160 fleece-lined boiler suit available in three colours – marine blue, moss green and midnight black – that’s designed for the fashion-conscious as well as the wet. Deacon’s family own multiple Dryrobes – she bought her first five years ago when she started swimming outdoors regularly after moving from London to Edinburgh. “Dryrobes are incredibly useful,” she says, “It’s quite difficult to get changed on a beach when you’re very cold without dropping your towel and flashing your boobs or your bum. They don’t look great, but they’re practical.” Except, well, plenty of people seem to think they do look great – or at least good enough to wear in the supermarket or the pub. Like the Ugg and the Croc before it, the Dryrobe is a divisive piece of clothing, inspiring ire but continuing to grow in popularity. Bright himself admits that when he was first testing prototypes, people gave him “funny stares” at the beach – so how exactly did the Dryrobe leapfrog into fashion? How did a changing robe become a coat? Cost is a factor. Sloman, who has lived in Brighton since 1988, says: “The people who tend to wear them are the ones who came down [to Brighton] from London and exchanged flats for big houses here.” For him, the coats have become a symbol of gentrification. He estimates you can spot “10 in half an hour” on Hove seafront, but the best place he saw a Dryrobe was outside Waitrose. The woman wearing it “was doing squats in her Dryrobe in the queue,” he marvels. Whether or not there is a particular “Dryrobe type” doesn’t change the fact that plenty of people think there is; there’s a “dryrobe wankers” Facebook group with 478 members that bemoans “people using a Dryrobe for anything else other than its intended purpose”. Though Deacon only dons her robe after swimming – and then, only in winter – she defends those seen wearing them elsewhere. “You might drive to go swimming and then on the way back, you go to the supermarket. It might not be an intentional thing of, ‘Look at my lifestyle,’” she says. Has this culture war affected sales? Bright won’t say, only offering: “It was actually all pretty good-natured fun when we looked into it.” But Google Trends, a tool that monitors the relative popularity of a search term over the years, shows that “dryrobe” searches began growing steadily in the summer of 2020. And (unpaid, accidental) celebrity endorsements helped – when Harry Styles was pictured wearing a Dryrobe after swimming in the sea for a film scene in May 2021, Google searches saw a healthy boost (he was pictured in one again last month). Perhaps it helps that, from a distance, Dryrobes don’t look too dissimilar from the long, padded jackets sold at Uniqlo or Moncler. Those who love their Dryrobes really do love them – a Facebook fanpage, “Dryrobe Owners’ Club”, has 3,000 members. “I’m not bothered what others think,” says member Gail Moorhouse, a 50-year-old civil servant from Huddersfield. Moorhouse bought her black, turquoise-lined Dryrobe for dog walking and camping: she doesn’t actually swim outdoors. “I loved it from the first time I used it,” she says, praising its big pockets, overall size and warmth. She has worn it to the pub in bad weather. Bright doesn’t point to any one particular marketing drive or branding decision that made the Dryrobe what it is today – though the company has hired athletes (such as surfers Ben and Lukas Skinner) as ambassadors, and the company supports outdoor activity charities through its Dryrobe Warmth Project. Perhaps the real trick was creating something equally as loved as it is hated. “Do you know something? I’ve got nothing against people using them for what they’re for,” Sloman says. “The problem is that Dryrobe has become more than what it’s used for.” Could the boom be just a temporary fad? “I think it’s getting worse,” he says. “They’ve even got Dryrobe doggie coats now.” Hair and makeup: Delilah Blakeney using Charlotte Tilbury.

2/4/2022,"British boxing’s mid-winter hiatus ends on Saturday night in Cardiff as Chris Eubank Jr and Liam Williams meet in a grudge middleweight match which promises to be as bitter in the ring as it has been in the acrimonious build-up to their contest. Eubank Jr and Williams are both running out of time and opportunities at the highest level and defeat for either fighter will come as a heavy blow. The British Boxing Board of Control put the sport into a self-imposed lockdown throughout January “to allow doctors and medical experts to prioritise their work with the NHS during the pandemic.” The doctors’ crucial work at ringside, while monitoring the risk and damage that boxers face, resumes in Cardiff in front of a sold-out arena. They will be especially vigilant when Eubank and Williams enter the ring. While neither man is an elite-level fighter, they offer a sobering reminder of boxing’s dangerous undertow.  In March 2016, Nick Blackwell, who was one of Williams’s closest friends in boxing, defended his British middleweight title against Eubank. Blackwell suffered a sustained beating and was stopped in the 10th round. He then collapsed while the doctor was examining the grotesque swelling above his left eye. Blackwell was rushed to hospital and placed in a medically induced coma for nine days. He survived and partially recovered before he made the mistake of trying to spar behind closed doors, against all advice, and suffered further brain damage. That unsettling memory should temper excessive enthusiasm about the “needle” that clearly exists between Williams and Eubank. Their mutual dislike of each other appears genuine and the spite is deepened by the fact that they both feel they have to win this fight. Williams, an intensely proud Welshman, will have the vociferous backing of his home crowd, but he returns to the ring after a chastening defeat to Demetrius Andrade when the American won a wide decision and retained his WBO world middleweight title last April. Andrade, usually an ultra-cautious boxer with an awkward style, knocked down Williams in the second round and dominated the contest. The gulf between domestic and world level was made glaringly apparent to Williams. It was also his third loss, after Liam Smith beat him twice in 2017. A fourth defeat in his 28th fight would end Williams’ remaining world title aspirations at the age of 29. Eubank, the marginal favourite, has won 31 of his 33 bouts. But his two defeats, against Billy Joe Saunders in 2014 and George Groves in 2018, were clear-cut and highlighted his limitations. Yet he has always talked in the provocative style of his father, Chris Eubank Sr, who was an even more outrageous pantomime villain in the 1990s. Eubank Jr has won his last five fights and victory over Williams could secure him another crack at a world title. But defeat would be just as crushing for him, at the age of 32, as the Welshman. Such intensity and rivalry could produce a riveting domestic classic. The undercard will be illuminated by Claressa Shields, the former Olympic champion who defends her WBA, WBC and IBF world middleweight titles against Ema Kozin. The brilliant American should win comfortably and set up her return to the UK in the summer when she will meet Savannah Marshall, the WBO champion, and the only woman to have ever beaten Shields in a boxing ring. They were amateurs then but Shields and Marshall are destined for a fight that will elevate the rise of women’s boxing even further. Caroline Dubois, the prodigiously talented 21-year-old who was so disappointed to narrowly lose out on a medal at the Tokyo Olympics, makes her professional debut against Vaida Masiokaite, a Lithuanian journeywoman. Dubois expects an easy win to begin a career that is rich in promise and should scale the heights of boxing in the coming years. For the loser of the main event, whether that is Eubank Jr or Williams, such dreams of glory will come to a shuddering end. It promises to be a night full of stark dangers and vivid contrasts.",Sport/Sport,Chris Eubank Jr v Liam Williams grudge match ends boxing’s midwinter hiatus,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/04/chris-eubank-jr-v-liam-williams-grudge-match-ends-boxing-midwinter-hiatus
2/4/2022,"When I was at school there were two choices for lunch: hot or cold food. If we queued up for a hot lunch, we would get what we were given – usually some combination of meat and two veg. Back then, I didn’t know anyone with dietary preferences or limitations, such as allergies. I also didn’t think much about where food came from or what it did to my body. At home, things were much the same: dinner would be meat or fish with potato in various guises or, occasionally, rice, plus a few different types of veg. Dairy and gluten were definitely on the menu, and whether or not either of these aggravated our digestive system wasn’t a consideration.  In my late teens, I started to become aware of vegetarianism and knew a few people who adopted that lifestyle, but it wasn’t until I was in my mid-20s that I came across anyone who was vegan. At first, it seemed so extreme. So complicated. It was all about what you couldn’t eat, not what you could. Yet, in the 10 years since, I and most of my friends have, for environmental reasons, moved towards either a more flexible diet where dairy and meat consumption is limited or are fully fledged vegans. So what happened? The plant-based movement is what happened, and it’s far bigger than just us as a nation. Around the world, notions of what constitutes a healthy diet have changed rapidly. Meanwhile, our access to different foods has exploded over the past 20 years, adjusting our idea of what is “normal” when it comes to diet. According to a study for Oatly, a company that creates dairy alternatives from oats, 23% of those who responded believe the term “normal” has lost its meaning and relevance, and 29% believe they don’t live a “normal lifestyle” (compared with 61% who say they do). At the same time, 39% think a plant-based diet is now “normal”, and 73% think they themselves have a normal diet – which most respondents classify as “a combination of meat, fish, dairy and veg”. Basically, the thing that has changed most – more so than even our actual diets – is our perception of what is considered normal. Growing environmental concerns and eco-anxiety are in part responsible for this shift. A 2021 study by YouGov shows that 17% of Britons believe that the threat of a climate crisis is exaggerated, while 68% believe it’s genuine. And 72% of us now believe the climate is changing as a result of human activity, compared with just 49% in 2013. Against this backdrop, it’s not hard to see why so many people are changing their behaviours around food and eating, with more people moving towards a flexitarian diet – which is centred around plant-based foods with the occasional inclusion of meat. Food allergies are also playing a part, being far more common than they once were, and affecting between 6% and 8% of children up to the age of three, according to the National Allergy Research Foundation. While there are various possible explanations for this, allergies mean that many people who may hope to eat a “normal” diet simply can’t. In addition, as many as two in 10 people develop an inability to digest lactose (lactose intolerance) later in life, making ingesting dairy products uncomfortable. For these people, as well as those suffering from more acute allergies related to dairy, a proliferation of non-dairy products over the past few years – such as nut and oat drinks – has given them far more choice in what they eat. Whichever way you look at it, we are all thinking differently about our diet, whether it’s for health reasons or concerns about the environment. Most families these days have had to adapt their previous eating habits to cater to specific dietary requirements. In my family alone, we have one vegan, two people with dairy allergies, and at least one person with lactose intolerance. And doesn’t everyone think their family is more or less normal? Change can sometimes feel overwhelming, but it also presents great opportunities to experiment and branch out with food, which can probably only be a good thing for our health and that of the planet. And there has truly never been a better time to do so with thousands of different products and recipes to help us diversify what we put on our plates. So why not give it a try?

2/4/2022,"Iused to live on a road in London that the neighbours would often close for street parties – I’ll just come out and say it, Stoke Newington – and frankly I found the whole charade quite irritating. I was always cycling into a big plant pot someone had dragged into the road, that sort of thing. There would be a marquee up early on a Saturday with 6 Music playing too loudly for my hangover. You learn a lot about your neighbours when you watch them sit in the middle of the road and eat a focaccia finger: who, for example, has quite such a substantial amount of fabric bunting on hand at all times, and space for it in their house? I began to see them less as people and more like animals I might disinterestedly stare at in a zoo: lizards in a tank, pointing a finger to a lidless tub of hummus while saying, “Ooh that’s good – what’s that one? Red pepper? Red pepper. Yeah no I’ve never had that. Red pepper”. Anyway, big year for it. The Queen is doing something – still being the Queen, by the looks of it, well done – and we, the peasants, are being urged to celebrate her for it. With the platinum jubilee around the corner, a host of very mild British stars – Gareth Southgate, Ross Kemp, Prue Leith, Big Alan Titchmarsh – are backing plans for a celebratory street party, where they hope 10 million of us will block up the roads and put stupid union flag wigs on, and wave and rah for the Queen. It’s called National Thank You Day, and to make it all feel slightly less embarrassing it’s being wrapped up with all the NHS rainbow stuff and community spirit newspeak of the past two years. It’s quite muddy messaging, actually. It really could do with one extra spin around the thinktank.  “Mainly it’s thank you to our Queen, who has served for 70 years,” Ross Kemp told Good Morning Britain this week, from in front of Windsor Castle (she’s not gonna let you in, mate). He went on: “It’s a big thank you to her but it’s a big thank you, if you wish, to staff of the NHS, people who have volunteered, neighbours who have gone round and just checked on people.” I really love the use of “if you wish” in that sentence – if you really must insist on thanking people who have done things, sure, but for me this is mainly about Lizzy Dos – but Kemp pivoted back to keeping it on message. “And by golly do we need a big party right now! But primarily it’s a huge thank you to an extraordinary woman who has steered this country and the Commonwealth for the past 70 years with – ” at this point Ross Kemp drops into his “gangs” voice “ – a steady hand.” Meanwhile, various MPs this week have drawn up plans to make Big Ben bong 70 times in a row in honour of the jubilee, too. Extraordinary what they can get done when they actually want to, isn’t it? My beef with National Thank You Day isn’t with the Queen, so tell MI5 to call off the snipers currently aimed at my head. And it’s not with the members of the community we should be thanking right now – National Thank You Day actually emerged last year, as a sort of glorified NHS clap, and folding it up into the Queen stuff in 2022 probably does make people more likely to mark it. No: I suppose my problem with it all is that it adds to this bizarrely prevalent idea that we as a people got through Covid very nobly, thanks to that one speech the Queen did and the strength of Captain Tom and the inherent goodness and kindness of the Great British People. This is not quite how I remember it at all: sure, some people checked on neighbours, and dropped shopping off, and banged a pan every Thursday. But many others called the police on people for going for two jogs in one day, posted disappointed photos from beaches of other people going to the beach, and tutted loudly whenever someone sat down on a park bench they could vaguely see through binoculars. Meanwhile, the group that we, the people, had duly elected to steer us through the storm were too busy going through the entire national supply of Colin the Caterpillar cakes to do much about it. So we should not be packaging up the disastrous past two years in twee, apolitical, self-congratulatory “Keep Calm and Carry On” wrapping paper. National Thank You Day is ultimately harmless in the same way most British pomp is – put it in the basket with breathless 24-hour royal wedding coverage, the Last Night of the Proms, RAF flyovers and remembering the Olympic opening ceremony – but the “blitzification” of Covid cannot continue unabated. Let’s announce National We All Apologise to Each Other for How Frantic We Got Over the Past 24 Months day. See if Steve McFadden, Roy Hodgson and Charlie Dimmock want to endorse it.

2/4/2022,"1 Eat with friendsIf you have friends coming over for food and just one is following a meat-free diet, make the same meal for everyone. Not only will you spare yourself the hassle of cooking different dishes, you’ll also actually pep up your party: research from the University of Chicago shows that sharing the same food, not just sitting down to eat together, improves trust and cooperation. 2 Explore new cuisinesForget what you can’t eat and get excited about discovering new ingredients and restaurants. Ethiopia has a reputation for incredible, soul-warming vegan food. Dishes from south India are less likely to use meat and ghee than those from the north. If you’re looking up recipes, you might be able to get inspiration from certain occasions: food that’s eaten in Greece during Lent, for example, is mostly meat- and dairy-free.  3 Challenge yourself to a 30-plant weekFive a day? Old news. Scientists in the US found that people who ate 30 different kinds of plants in a week had a much more varied gut microbiome than those who ate 10 or fewer. Their research showed it could improve your digestion and reduce the risk of bowel cancer. So how do we fit more plant-based foods into our diet? Think about adding one extra vegetable to your side salad. Grate a carrot into tomato sauce in lieu of sugar. Start eating plants at breakfast, adding dried or fresh fruits to porridge, or cooking up spinach or mushrooms. 4 Hit the marketAnd no, it doesn’t have to be a bougie farmers’ market. If you’re lucky enough to live within striking distance of a local market, it’s a cheap and fun way to shop. The whole “pound a bowl!” joy makes for vibrant streets, and the stacks of fresh produce will inspire your cooking. When you have impulsively purchased a bag full of aubergines for a pound, you’ll want to find ways to use them. 5 Think of alternativesAt the supermarket, you’ll notice that the section of vegan alternatives is expanding rapidly. And, again, choosing to explore will pay delicious dividends. Jackfruit cooked as a curry or stuffed into a burrito is lush and filling. Oat drinks make for incredibly creamy porridge and smooth hot chocolate (whisk up with cocoa powder, sugar and a pinch of mixed spice). Nutritional yeast may sound a bit bleak, but it’s great for adding a savoury, cheesy flavour to sauces. 6 But what about protein?Plant-based diets can fall short on protein, but you can meet your daily requirements by eating a variety of beans, pulses, grains and nuts – all of which provide more dietary fibre than meat. About one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions come from the food system, with half of those emissions produced from the livestock (or animal-based) sector. 7 Don’t stress about labelsIn general, animal-based products have a higher environmental impact than plant-based products. If you want to reduce your climate impact, switch to a more plant-based diet. But on a personal level, it can be difficult to tell yourself you will never eat roast beef again. There’s no need to issue a press release that you’re now vegan, vegetarian, flexitarian or whatever. Ditch the labels. Just keep exploring new foods and making small changes, because every time we choose plant-based we’re helping the environment. Looking for dietary advice from a puppet? Watch THE NEW NORM&AL SHOW.
