5/18/2022,"China will seek talks with whichever party wins Saturday’s Australian federal election, with diplomatic sources declaring that they see “a good opportunity” to ease tensions in the period after the vote. A Chinese diplomatic source, who did not wish to be named, said China was “genuine in our wish to improve the relationship” with Australia, although to date it has not publicly detailed any specific actions it is willing to take. The source also pushed back at a description by the defence minister, Peter Dutton, that a Chinese intelligence gathering vessel seen off the coast of Western Australia last week was an aggressive act. “It’s nothing to be worried [about],” the Chinese diplomatic source said. “There’s no animosity that should be interpreted in such a presence of a ship in the exclusive economic zone of Australia … We don’t agree with his judgment about a threat.” Both the current Coalition government and Labor opposition in Australia view the problems in the relationship with China as structural, rather than something that can be fixed with a change in rhetoric. Australian officials have raised concerns about China’s trajectory in recent years, including its buildup of disputed features in the South China Sea, the crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong, allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang, and trade actions against a range of Australian export sectors. China’s signing of a security agreement with Solomon Islands in the early stages of the Australian election campaign has prompted a furious debate about how Australia can best counter China’s attempts to deepen its influence in the region. Dutton has repeatedly stated he has “no doubt” the Chinese Communist party wants the Morrison government to lose the election – something Labor opposition has denounced as a “conspiracy theory”. Labor has said it has the same policy as the Coalition in dealing with a “more assertive, more aggressive, more coercive” Chinese government. The Chinese diplomatic source suggested that the post-election period “offers a good opportunity” to improve ties, but made clear that this view applied regardless of whether the Morrison government was re-elected or the Albanese opposition won office. China was open to talks irrespective of who formed government. “We could have good momentum for the relationship,” the source said. “We genuinely believe this relationship should work for the interest of both peoples, as it had [in the past].” China’s new ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, has made several public overtures for dialogue since arriving in Canberra in January and has met with both the foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, and Labor’s shadow minister, Penny Wong. But despite saying the two countries should “meet each other halfway”, Xiao is yet to publicly spell out any tangible actions Beijing may be willing to take, for example reversing tariffs on Australian wine and barley that are subject to a World Trade Organization challenge. Payne and Wong have both expressed their openness to dialogue while saying Australia won’t take a backward step on matters of national interest, security and sovereignty. The Australian government has said China has continued to block meetings and calls between Australian government ministers and their direct Chinese counterparts since 2020. At a foreign policy debate last Friday, Payne and Wong were both asked what Australia could do to de-escalate the tensions. Payne said she did not accept the premise of the question, because Australia had “done the right thing in terms of protecting our national interests and our national security”. Payne said Australia would “continue to seek a constructive relationship with China, but it has to be a relationship in which our sovereignty and our interests are respected and in which no party is coerced or subjected to pressures that breach international rules”. She said Australia would not give way on any of the 14 points on the “list of grievances” issued by the Chinese embassy in 2020. Wong outlined a similar position, saying Australia’s relationship with Beijing had changed because China had changed. “An Albanese Labor government would not take a backwards step when it comes to standing up for Australia’s interests,” Wong said. “Marise is right to point to the coercive economic measures.” Wong said the reality was that there would be differences between Australia and China that would need to be managed, regardless of who won government. When asked by Laura Tingle whether there was a step China could take to show good faith to improve the relationship, Wong said: “Well, they could desist from the coercive economic positions that they put in place in relation to Australia.” Wong also urged China to “comply with the decision of arbitral tribunal in relation to the South China Sea”.",News/Australia news,China seeks to reset relationship with Australia after election,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/18/china-seeks-to-reset-relationship-with-australia-after-election
5/18/2022,"The European Union has resolved to step up its defence strategy in the Indo-Pacific region in light of fears about China’s growing presence and concerns for the international order sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Our motto is always to cooperate whenever possible, but to defend whenever necessary as well,” said Gabriele Visentin, the EU’s special envoy to the Indo-Pacific. “It’s not directed against a country or another – it’s a way of enhancing our capacity and our credibility in terms of defending our interests.” Visentin said there was no evidence to suggest a war was imminent in the region – which covers a vast sweep of the globe from the east coast of Africa to the Pacific island countries – but the EU was concerned the “multilateral rules-based order will not be fully respected”. “The pricetag that has been put on the breach of the multilateral rules-based order is quite high. It’s surely a signal to others who might wish to break the multilateral order in such a violent way, well, then they know what they can encounter.” China is viewed as the biggest such threat in the region. Visentin said China was seen as “a partner, a competitor and a rival” by the EU. Growing concerns over its military buildup and strategic intentions flared after a draft security pact between China and Solomon Islands was leaked in March, blindsiding the islands’ traditional partners such as Australia, the US and New Zealand. The loosely worded deal triggered alarm that regional stability could be jeopardised, with China having the opportunity to base its warships in the Pacific less than 2,000km off the Australian coast. While France stated it was “worrying on many levels, particularly concerning China’s ambitions as a regional security actor”, Visentin was reluctant to comment on whether the EU considered it a threat to security, until he had seen the agreement’s details, adding that every state had the right to make sovereign choices. “But of course, the signal that the Solomon Islands have sent to us is loud and clear: the EU and others have to do more.” Sujiro Seam, the EU’s ambassador for the Pacific and Solomon Islands, said the deal pointed to the EU’s need to step up in the Pacific region. “EU’s experience in matters of security and defence in the Pacific is very limited. It is a challenge for the future, and this security agreement between China and the Solomon Islands must be considered in the development of the European Union action on security and defence in the region. “Traditionally in the Pacific, the European Union has been a development partner. The main challenge is to show that we can be something else, a strategic partner in security and defence.” In March, the EU approved a plan to strengthen its global security and defence policy. The Strategic Compass, as it is known, sets out a roadmap to improve the EU’s ability to act decisively in crises and defend its security and its citizens. “The adoption of this strategy is even more relevant, given the war in Ukraine,” Seam said. “The war in Ukraine is a historic moment that contributes to the affirmation of European ambition in matters of security and defence.” A more intensive security plan would not involve the establishment of military bases nor the deploying of troops unless in a crisis, Visentin said, but rather conducting military training and live exercises on land and sea, boosting intelligence, and having EU ships pass through zones with maritime interest.",News/World news,EU to step up Indo-Pacific defence presence over China fears and Ukraine example,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/18/eu-to-step-up-indo-pacific-defence-presence-over-china-fears-and-ukraine-example
5/18/2022,"Tymofiy Seidov is the only child left in his village near the city of Kharkiv, in north east Ukraine. The eight-year-old spends much of his time drawing at a little table, dimly illuminated from above by a tiny LED light, in the corner of the otherwise almost completely dark 40-by-five-metre basement that he shares with 23 others including his mum, aunt and grandmother. Tanks feature a lot in his pictures. But today, in the gloom, he is working on some Dalek-like monsters that he says he remembers from a cartoon he watched on YouTube before the war. He also draws happier scenes, sometimes, of houses under the sun and rainbows in the sky. But the world outside this underground flea market, full of jumble, mattresses, chairs, washing lines, giant jars of pickled vegetables, dusty marked duvets, plastic bags full of clothes and framed icons proudly on display atop overturned boxes, has been out of bounds to him for months. There is a Spiderman figure, a few packs of cards, a Mike the Knight board game and a collection of felt-tip pens and pencils on his table, but Tymofiy has not seen another child since 30 April, when most of the basement was evacuated. This quiet, polite boy and his family have been living in this basement below the ruins of a two-storey kindergarten and medical centre in the village of Kutuzivka, 12 miles east of Kharkiv, since the war in Ukraine began on 24 February. The fighting around Kutuzivka has been bitter. Closer to Russia than any other large Ukrainian city, Kharkiv was a key target for Vladimir Putin and this territory was the way through. Before the war, the population of Kutuzivka was 1,500-strong. Today it is less than 50. The Russians took the village on 18 March before losing it to Ukrainian forces just two weeks ago. The abandoned protective vests, helmets, wound dressings and half-eaten plates of polenta strewn across what was the Russian headquarters in the village’s community centre suggest it was a hasty departure. But if the Russians can leave in a flash after nearly two months of occupation, the exhausted and tearful people in Tymofiy’s basement know that they could just as quickly return – or at least the artillery can. Much of the damage in their village and to their homes above has been done since the Ukrainian soldiers arrived, which was when the Russians started to batter their positions – and anything else that got in the way. Eight Ukrainain soldiers were killed nearby that very morning. While there appears to be little more to hit apart from crumbling buildings and torn metal, the sound of shelling remains constant – often very loud and close. Speaking as another thud of artillery fire sounds, Tymofiy’s mum, Rita, 32, says she never thinks about tomorrow. “I just think about surviving,” she says. A painter before the war, Rita has not put paint to paper since 24 February. “I want to forget, to never think of it – I don’t have the materials here anyway but I don’t want to paint about it,” she says. The basement has four doorless rooms. There is a calendar on display in each of them with the days of the month passed crossed off. It is, they say, important to remember how long they have been down here and to know that it will not last for ever. A small calendar above where Timofiy is working, stuck up on the wall between sketches of two Ukrainian flags, was drawn by a 15-year-old boy after he dreamed that the Ukrainians would liberate the village on 27 April. When that prophecy came true, the boy left with his parents, as did most of the 150 people, including 40 children, who had been living in the basement. But Timofiy and his family had nowhere to go. The basement residents do, however, have each other. Alla Lisnenko, 59, is the cook. With a torch attached to her head with elastic, she is chopping aubergine for tonight’s dinner. When everyone came underground on 24 February they brought the contents of their larders, but fresh food has been at a premium. It was a relief when some of the men dug shallow wells to get drinking water, but everyone soon became sick because the acrid smoke from burned-out homes had polluted them. That is where Natalya Leus, 40, a nurse who had worked in the medical centre above, came in. She used what medicines she could to try to keep the children in particular hydrated when they struggled to keep water and food down. Alla’s husband, Alexander, is a particular favourite in the basement. He had built a wood-burning stove for someone before the war and three weeks after the Russians invaded, he brought it into the freezing basement, and has been regularly feeding it with logs. He also sourced the four LED lights wired to an old truck battery that offer at least some illumination to their underground home. Nadiya Ryzkova, 75, whose house was recently destroyed, provides an ample supply of milk. She sneaks out in the early in the morning to milk the goats herself. “We drink it every day,” she says, flourishing a large bottle of it. “We can certainly share,” she laughs. With some western analysts suggesting that the Battle for Kharkiv is all but over, everyone hopes that the arrival of the Ukrainian forces is the beginning of the end. It was Alla, the cook, who irst spotted the friendly faces first during a dart back to her house for supplies and brought the news to the basement. “I heard some tanks moving by I saw Ukrainian soldiers”, she says. “I was blowing them kisses but they signalled for me to get down. ‘Get down granny’,” she laughs. “I shouted glory Ukraine.” Did they celebrate? “Not yet,” says Rita. “We don’t know what is coming next”.",News/World news,Drawing monsters in the basement: last child in Ukrainian village in ruin,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/17/drawing-monsters-in-the-basement-last-child-in-ukrainian-village-in-ruin
5/18/2022,"On the final manic drive to the ballot box, we approach the national crossroads with justified trepidation: are we heading towards the light or is that another runaway train coming to plough us down? We pollsters and pundits (and we progressives in general) are all experiencing our own form of PTSD after the car crash that was the 2019 election, where we misread the warning signs and plunged off an electoral cliff. The final Guardian Essential Report of the campaign finds Labor with an advantage that, if replicated nationally and flowing through the final 7% of undecided voters, would deliver a change of government. But there are caveats to these numbers reflected in the regional differences outlined above. In truth, this national election is at least three separate, but ultimately converging, contests. One election campaign is being fought in middle-class suburbs of our major cities, where cost of living and housing prices are biting. These are seats the Coalition held on to in 2019 on the promise not to wind back tax concessions, but with these policies off the table, Labor is making its case for safe change. A second election campaign is being fought on the fringes of our major cities where there are more low-information voters in Labor-held seats who Scott Morrison believes can be won over with tightly targeted culture wars. Finally, there is the battle in high-income inner-city seats where the Liberal party’s few remaining moderates are facing a reckoning for the party’s ongoing neglect of climate change, government integrity and gender equity. Because of the fragmented nature of the contest, national trends are not determinative, and ultimately election night will be a question about distribution of vote as much as it is one of size. There are other markers that give an indication of how this journey ends. Through the campaign we have charted the relative popularity of the leaders, where Morrison is now in net negative, while Anthony Albanese sits in net positive, basically reversing the standings of Morrison and Bill Shorten three years ago. Another key indicator is voter choice: what is the question voters are asking themselves as they enter the ballot box? Trying to proffer a fair read-out of each side’s essential propositions, for the Morrison government it’s been about a safe pair of hands to manage the economy, while for Albanese’s Labor it has been about the need for government to confront the problems the nation is facing. Lining these two choices up show that it is Labor’s frame that is defining the contest. Indeed, in recent days Morrison has conceded he has lost the voter choice battle and is attempting to recast himself as a positive agent for change. The challenge he faces is that if change is the voter choice proposition, it is hard to see the status quo prevailing. So what happens now? The windscreen is way too dirty to predict the outcome on Saturday with anything resembling confidence. The only certainty is that when we look in the rearview mirror on Sunday morning at what has just happened, it will all be crystal clear. If Labor wins a majority it will be because: Albanese has delivered on a disciplined three-year strategy that learned from the shock of 2019 by eschewing performative politics and ruthlessly focusing on winning government. Labor will have earned power by playing a constructive role though the first year of the pandemic when many state oppositions tried to score cheap points, but then being relentless in holding the government to account through 2021 when the government dallied on vaccines, neglected quarantine and politicised border closures. The reality will be that Morrison lost this election in 2019 with his Hawaiian sojourn, the handshake and the hose. This dodging of responsibility framed every later act of neglect: of women, of climate, of aged care, of the NDIS all coming home to roost in the campaign until his personal reputation was fatal on his party. His final days will be remembered for a chaotic and disjointed campaign where he seemed to deliberately sacrifice progressive seats to the teals. If Morrison manages to hold on: it will be his “second miracle”, another triumph of tactics and testimony to his mastery of the game that electoral politics has become. Enough voters will have accepted that “you couldn’t blame ScoMo for the pandemic” and that Australia did well enough compared with other countries. The Deves gambit to narrowcast bigotry to specific targets will have done its work. Morrison will emerge with immense personal authority inside the government, caring even less for accountability having seen how little performance actually matters. Labor will be left ruing their leader’s day one campaign brain fade that became an iconic political moment, giving a feral press pack a taste of blood in the water that was never sated. There will also be regrets that Albanese presented too small a target and that he left it too late to reveal himself to the electorate, allowing the government to define him on the basis of his missteps. After running “too hot” in 2019, it will be determined that Labor overcorrected though its conscious decision to take passion out of the broader progressive movement. If we end with minority government determined by independents: it will mean Australia is ready to fundamentally rewrite its political faultlines. The result will reflect the reality that more Australians have moved from the major parties to new alliances of post-material urbanites and outsider nativists. After a vitriolic campaign against the independents, Morrison will be incapable of cobbling together a stable minority, squeezed by the Nationals on the right and the teals on the left, pushing and pulling into areas the other side just won’t go. A Labor minority negotiated with the teals, Greens and other independents will have a greater chance of success, although the lessons of 2010-2013 may preclude a formal power-sharing agreement. With an angry and divided opposition egged on by a shrill Murdoch press, it will be a wild ride, but one with the potential to create a more collaborative model of politics in Australia into the future. Which road? Right now, all of these futures are possible as we enter the final straight. If I had to make a call, I think the tide has turned on Morrison and government will change. If history is our guide, that change will be decisive. A narrow win from opposition will be truly historic, but one we will take all the same. But just as I cautioned on election eve 2019, while the champagne should be put on ice, we would all be well-advised to keep the scotch close at hand on Saturday night.  Yes, this adds up to 101%, but that is because the three figures have all been rounded up.  Peter Lewis will discuss the findings of the Essential Report with Guardian Australia political editor Katharine Murphy and Australia Institute deputy director Ebony Bennett at the special election eve time of 6pm on Wednesday.

5/18/2022,"Young New Zealanders are leaving in droves as borders reopen and economic conditions tighten at home. The latest data from Stats NZ found that in the year to March, annual net migration was negative, with 7,300 more people leaving than entering. That loss marks a dramatic shift from early in the pandemic when border closures and the relative safety of Covid-free New Zealand prevented many from leaving. In the year to March 2020 there was a record net gain of 91,700. Now, many New Zealanders – particularly young professionals and graduates – are heading off overseas once more. Some are driven by tough economic conditions in New Zealand, which is dealing with high inflation of 6.9%, housing unaffordability, and sky-high living costs: petrol, rents, mortgage interest rates and groceries are all on the rise. Brad Olsen, Infometrics principal economist and director, said the latest figures “demonstrate just how momentous really the shift has been in New Zealand’s migration outcomes”, changing to a net loss from 50,000-60,000 annual net gains in the years leading up to the pandemic. “It’s a huge reversal – and the first time we’ve seen those negative figures since the global financial crisis, the Christchurch earthquakes and the Australian mining boom all combined in the early 2010s.” Stats NZ, the government’s data and statistics agency, said the losses were driven by young adults, with a particular increase in New Zealand citizens aged 18 to 27 leaving. With unemployment already at a low of 3.2%, economists say the loss of more of the workforce via migration could create ongoing labour shortages. “The difficulty finding workers is extreme around the country – you have a smaller working age population than the year before, at a time when everyone is desperately calling out for workers. [It] really just exacerbates the pressures that businesses are under,” Olsen said. In April, government documents estimated that 50,000 people would leave over the next year – but that the number could swell to 125,000 if the many young people who had delayed post-graduation trips during the pandemic left too. Asked about those projected losses, the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said that overseas trips were “part of our history” and a rite of passage for many New Zealanders, noting that she had spent time living in London. “It has been part of our history as a nation to frequently have New Zealanders come and go as part of our overseas experience, building skills and talent.” Olsen said there were a mixture of contributing factors including pent-up demand from those who delayed leaving over the past two years, high living costs, housing unaffordability, and delays fully reopening New Zealand’s borders, which meant lower numbers of migrants coming in.",News/World news,More people leaving New Zealand than entering as young flee high cost of living,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/18/more-people-leaving-new-zealand-than-entering-as-young-flee-high-cost-of-living
