1/26/2022,"The president of Fifa, Gianni Infantino, has said his plans for a World Cup every two years could stop African migrants from finding “death in the sea”, in an extraordinary address to European politicians. Speaking at a session of the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe, a trans-national body dedicated to the support of human rights, Infantino said that countries outside Europe needed greater access to national football competitions to prevent drastic consequences.  Infantino was discussing his strategy known as the Future of Football, which to this point has concentrated on doubling the frequency of Fifa’s flagship competition. He told the assembly: “This topic is not about whether we want a World Cup every two years, but about what do we want to do for the future of football. “If we think about rest of world,” he continued, “and the vast majority of Europe, then we have to think about what football brings. Football is about opportunity, about hope, about the national teams. We cannot say to the rest of world give us your money, but watch us on TV. We need to include them. “We need to find ways to include the whole world to give hope to Africans so that they don’t need to cross the Mediterranean in order to find maybe a better life but, more probably, death in the sea. “We need to give opportunities, to give dignity. Not by charity but by allowing the rest of the world to participate. Maybe the World Cup every two years is not the answer. We discuss it.” The Future of Football project, led by the former Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger, has been widely rejected by European football and its political organisations. Infantino was speaking after the British politician Lord Foulkes had presented a report on football reform, which specifically questioned “the advisability” of the biennial World Cup plan. Infantino’s remarks provoked immediate outrage. Ronan Evain, the chief executive of Football Supporters Europe, tweeted: “How low can Infantino go? Instrumentalising death in the Mediterranean to sell his megalomaniac plan is beyond words.”",Sport/Football,Fifa president: more World Cups could save African migrants from death in the sea,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/26/fifa-gianni-infantino-biennial-world-cup-could-save-african-migrants-from-death-in-the-sea
1/26/2022,"Daniil Medvedev saved a match point and recovered from two sets down to defeat Félix Auger-Aliassime and reach his fifth grand slam semi-final. The world No 2 is looking to become the first man in the Open era to follow a first grand slam title by winning the next major tournament, but his chances were hanging by a thread when Canadian Auger-Aliassime won the first two sets.  However, the Russian won a third-set tie-break, saved a match point before winning the fourth and capitalised on an early break in the fifth to take the match 6-7 (4), 3-6, 7-6 (2), 7-5, 6-4. “I was not playing my best and Félix was playing unbelievable, serving unbelievable,” said Medvedev. “I didn’t really know what to do. I don’t know if you’re going to like this but I told myself: ‘What would Novak do?’ What came into my mind, I just thought, ‘OK, I’m going to make him work. If he wants to win it, he’s going to have to fight until the last point’. I managed to raise my level.” He will next face Stefanos Tsitsipas in a rematch of last year’s semi-final. Earlier, Tsitsipas produced his best performance of the tournament to defeat Jannik Sinner in straight sets.

1/26/2022,"The thing about governments in crisis is that they have little time for governing. Boris Johnson – once king of the world, now lame duck – is a prime minister consumed with his own survival. Insiders say Johnson is motivated to hang on to power not to deliver a pressing policy agenda but to beat former Bullingdon Club chum, David Cameron: “He won’t accept the last Etonian PM having survived longer than him.” Meanwhile, in the real world, British families are about to endure the worst cost of living crisis for 30 years, and are left waiting for anyone in power to notice. For many, the money going out is about to soar, causing that coming in to shrink in real terms. Inflation rose to 5.4% last month, driven by pricier food and clothes. Energy tariffs are escalating and tax bills are set to go up too. At the same time, the £20 universal credit uplift has been cut and unemployment benefits are about to hit their lowest real value in more than three decades, a rate that experts call “only slightly more than destitution”. Ministers can claim work is the solution but it is good jobs, not any job, that is a reprieve; the majority of people living in poverty in the UK last year were in working households. The official line may be that the pandemic is over, but this too is still hitting personal finances – just ask the clinically vulnerable pensioner shielding in a cold home. The result of all this is clear enough: simply getting by is increasingly going to become a luxury.  The release of today’s report by the commission on social security – the result of a two-year initiative to outline proposals for a better benefits system led by claimants themselves – outlines the sort of ideas that could make a real difference right now. After a decade of pernicious and reduced welfare support, the report makes some useful proposals. It suggests scrapping universal credit and replacing it with a “guaranteed decent income for all”, set at 50% of the minimum wage (£163.50 a week); the end of benefit sanctions; and an end to using social security as a sticking plaster for failures elsewhere by abolishing zero-hour contracts and introducing free early child education and care. The concern here is not that Boris Johnson would never introduce such solutions – that’s hardly a surprise – but that his government is barely even engaged with the problem. Ask a minister what is the most pressing issue facing “families who are struggling to make ends meet”, and it’s not a threadbare benefits system, energy bills, rising food prices, or insecure work – it’s the BBC licence fee. That those on low incomes will be spending on average 18% of that income (after housing costs) on energy bills from April is seen by this government not as a looming threat, but an inconsequential sideshow. The crisis facing British people right now is not only that millions can’t afford the basics, it is that their leaders have no intention of helping them. Or even keeping up the pretence they will. This is a remarkable state of affairs once you really start to ponder it, though it is hardly new. People in this country have been skipping meals and wearing coats in their front rooms for some time, and no one has been paying attention to this either. The difference now, perhaps, is that such events will not be confined to the working class. Middle-class families who were previously managing could soon be tipped into financial hardship, while those who were already struggling will fall into abject poverty. Politics is often viewed through the prism of Westminster drama, a spectacle never clearer than the latest Conservative jostle for power. We are led to believe this is all that is important, that it is normal to dedicate more attention to what wine No 10 staff put in a suitcase than the fact many parents can’t afford to put food in the cupboard. Johnson clearly believes this himself to a large degree, seeing power as a game and the rest of us pawns. But politics – real politics – is not defined by the showy manoeuvres of a few at the top; it is defined by the ordinary matter of whether a teacher can afford to put the heating on in the winter. It is these mundane issues that appear to simply bore Johnson and the public school alumni around him. That staples such as eggs, butter and milk are seeing price rises may not be glamorous facts to ponder, but they are going to be part of the single most important issue facing this country in the coming months. That neither the labour market nor the social security system are fit for purpose to weather the storm is not only a deep concern for the future but a stark lesson in mistakes of the past. The way out of this will not be found through a different Tory sitting in Downing Street, nor perhaps even a change of party. What it requires above anything is a recognition that this country is crying out for dramatic change, and that playing by the same old economic rules will not get us there. This means shifting power out of Westminster and into communities, a rejuvenated modern welfare state, and a media willing to hold charlatans to account, rather than help them get elected. Until then, millions of people in Britain are going to find themselves falling below the breadline. The cost of living with Boris Johnson as prime minister is all too high.

1/26/2022,"Pioneering Australian photographer and film-maker Frank Hurley was the official witness to Sir Ernest Shackleton’s gruelling expedition attempting to cross the Antarctic landmass, which lasted three years from 1914 to 1917. For most of the time the crew were utterly cut off from news of the outside world and the expedition became an epic ordeal when, on the way there, their ship (aptly named Endurance) was crushed and sunk by pack ice. Shackleton and his men were forced to journey onwards in a lifeboat in the desolate cold, finally to South Georgia, then rescued and brought by a Chilean vessel to the harbour in Valparaíso where they were accorded a hero’s welcome. This 1919 silent movie is Hurley’s filmed record of Shackleton’s voyage and what is startling about it is its weird tonal obtuseness: so often it feels like a home-movie travelogue in which the mood is bafflingly jaunty. Towards the end of the film, just at the point when their lives have been saved and disaster averted, the film spends about 10 minutes on the adorable behaviour of the penguins. This is at the moment when Shackleton’s victory was said to consist simply in his heroic survival, the expedition itself having, of course, been a failure, but the film simply sets aside the obvious poignant or tragic dimension.  Perhaps this merely reflects the insistent stiff-upper-lip optimism and breeziness that the crew (including Hurley) had internalised in order to survive. Certainly, the first world war, which was happening at the same time, and which Shackleton’s fierce self-sacrifice and terrifying hardship could be said to mimic, is not mentioned. Probably the most sensational part of the entire film comes at the very beginning with Hurley’s glorious close-up portraits of his leading players, most prominently Shackleton. The sheer vividness of these personalities scorches out of the screen.

1/26/2022,"The Netherlands has lifted its toughest Covid controls, Denmark is to remove all restrictions within days and France will begin easing curbs next week, as many – but not all – EU countries opt to reopen despite record infection numbers. The moves come as data shows hospital and intensive care admissions are not surging in line with cases, and after the World Health Organization suggested the Omicron variant – which studies show is more contagious but usually less severe for vaccinated people – may signal a new, more manageable phase in the pandemic.  Dutch bars, restaurants and museums were allowed to reopen on Wednesday after the prime minister, Mark Rutte, said the government was “consciously looking for the limits of what is possible” as case numbers continued to hit new daily highs. Intensive care admissions and deaths, however, have been falling in the Netherlands, and the health minister, Ernst Kuipers, said a decision to prolong restrictive measures would have risked “harming our health and our society”. Cafes, bars and restaurants closed since mid-December can now reopen with reduced capacity and until 10pm as long as customers have a Covid pass, with cinemas, theatres, museums and sports events also allowed to welcome the public back. The Danish government, which two weeks ago allowed cinemas and music venues to reopen after a month’s closure, also announced on Wednesday plans to scrap remaining domestic coronavirus controls from 1 February. The move – which must be approved by parliament – will allow nightclubs to reopen, restaurants to serve alcohol after 10pm, and shops to lift limits on customer numbers. Vaccine passes will no longer be needed, and commuters may travel without wearing masks. Like the Netherlands, Denmark has set successive recent daily infection records. But while coronavirus-related hospitalisations have risen, health authorities say 30%-40% of patients with a positive test are in hospital for reasons other than Covid. “There has been a decoupling in the trend earlier in the epidemic, between increasing infection and increase in Covid hospitalisations,” the government’s expert advisory panel said. The number of Covid patients in intensive care has nearly halved since early January. Belgium last week announced a slight easing of its restrictions from Friday despite record infections, with bars and restaurants allowed to stay open until midnight and indoor activities such as play areas and bowling alleys to reopen. The country’s current Omicron wave is not expected to peak for a fortnight, but hospital admissions are rising at a far slower rate than infections and the number of patients in intensive care is falling. “The situation is manageable,” said the virologist Steven Van Gucht. France on Tuesday reported a new daily record of 501,635 new cases but, again, while hospital admissions have risen, only about half as many patients are in intensive care as during previous waves, and the number has been falling since 12 January. The health minister, Olivier Véran, said the peak of the current coronavirus wave should be reached within the next few days, while the prime minister, Jean Castex, last week announced a timetable for lifting Covid restrictions from 2 February. Castex said France’s vaccine pass, required since Monday to enter restaurants, cinemas and other public venues, would allow audience capacity limits for concert halls and sports and other events to be lifted, with working from home also no longer mandatory for many employees and face masks not needed outside. Some countries, however, are not yet ready to relax restrictions. Sweden’s health minister, Lena Hallengren, on Wednesday extended pandemic curbs by another two weeks because of “an extremely high level of spread”, meaning bars and restaurants must continue to close at 11pm. In Germany, which on Wednesday reported a new 24-hour record of 164,000 infections, MPs are preparing to debate proposals to either require or strongly encourage vaccination. About 74% of the population has received at least one dose, less than in France, Italy or Spain, but the government is divided over a possible vaccine mandate. Options include requiring all adult residents to be vaccinated against Covid, only those above 50, or merely to mandate counselling for unvaccinated people. The WHO’s Europe director, Hans Kluge, said on Sunday it was “plausible” the region was “moving towards a kind of pandemic endgame” and that Omicron could have infected 60% of the continent’s inhabitants by March. Once the current surge is over, immunity through infection or vaccination should last “quite some weeks and months”, Kluge told Agence-France Presse, adding that Covid may come back at the end of the year but not necessarily as a pandemic. He cautioned, however, that it was still too early to consider Covid endemic. “There is a lot of talk about endemic but endemic means it is possible to predict what’s going to happen. This virus has surprised us more than once,” he said, adding that other variants could still emerge.",News/World news,Netherlands lifts toughest Covid curbs with Denmark and France set to follow,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/as-omicron-fears-subside-europe-starts-to-reopen
1/26/2022,"The US investment bank Citigroup has embarked on an overhaul of its main tower in Canary Wharf that is expected to cost more than £100m. Citi will completely refurbish the 42-storey office block at 25 Canada Square in London Docklands over the next three years and create flexible work and collaboration spaces, alongside wellbeing zones for employees, to reflect the changing nature of work.  At the moment, the bank is spread across 25 Canada Square and 33 Canada Square, where its trading floor is based. All of its 9,000 London staff will relocate temporarily to 33 Canada Square and another nearby building until the skyscraper refurbishment is complete in 2025. Citi said it had hired 1,000 people in London in the past two years, and a similar number in Belfast, taking its workforce there to 3,200. It will continue to recruit more bankers in London, as well as in mainland Europe, where it still has a bigger presence than in the UK. David Livingstone, Citi’s chief executive for Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), said: “Our rejuvenated EMEA headquarters will be designed to maximise collaborative workspaces, supported by technology, to enable us to work flexibly and with maximum agility.” Citi bought the tower, one of the tallest in the UK, for more than £1bn in 2019, three years after the EU referendum, in what it said was a demonstration of its commitment to London as its EMEA headquarters, and a vital global hub for the bank. Last March, the bank’s chief executive, Jane Fraser, announced a permanent shift to hybrid working, involving “at least” three days a week in the office and up to two days at home. She also banned work video calls on Fridays to help employees break free from the “relentlessness of the pandemic workday”, designated 28 May as a company-wide holiday and encouraged staff to book more holidays or take 12-week sabbaticals. Citi decided to refurbish its Canary Wharf skyscraper, rather than demolishing it, because of the environmental impact, and believes others will follow suit. It is among the largest workplace refurbishment projects in Europe. The bank plans to add a promenade with a winter garden, more greenery, parents rooms, prayer and contemplation rooms, a wellness centre with a gym that offers health consultations, and a food court area and coffee bars. The project is a big boost to Canary Wharf, developed in the 1990s as an extension of the City of London’s financial district. It is heavily reliant on the 120,000 employees who work in the area but, as with the City, turned into a ghost town during Covid-19 lockdowns.",News/Business,Citigroup plans £100m revamp of Canary Wharf tower,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/26/citigroup-plans-100m-revamp-of-canary-wharf-tower
