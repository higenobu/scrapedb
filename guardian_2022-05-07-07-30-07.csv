5/7/2022,"A consortium led by Todd Boehly has signed a contract to buy Chelsea and the deal to end Roman Abramovich’s ownership will go through subject to Premier League and UK government approval. Boehly, a part-owner of baseball’s LA Dodgers and founder of Eldridge Industries, is expected to be the most public face of the consortium, although the largest stake in Chelsea is set to be held by the US private equity firm Clearlake Capital. Boehly has also partnered with his fellow Dodgers owner Mark Walter, the Swiss billionaire Hansjörg Wyss and the British property developer Jonathan Goldstein. Under the arrangement the Tory peer Daniel Finkelstein and the publicist Barbara Charone would become non-executive directors of the club. The group was selected as the preferred bidder last Friday and has secured an agreement despite late interest from Sir Jim Ratcliffe. A deal had appeared in doubt amid fears of Abramovich reneging on a promise to write off Chelsea’s debt but the Russian oligarch denied on Thursday he wanted his £1.6bn loan repaid and within hours it emerged an agreement would be struck with Boehly’s consortium. Chelsea are operating under a special licence triggered by the government when it imposed sanctions on Abramovich and froze his assets after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. That expires on 31 May, allowing more than three weeks for the sale to be completed. The Premier League must ensure all the consortium’s members pass its owners’ and directors’ test and Chelsea have to apply for a licence from the government to complete the takeover. Abramovich has said net proceeds from the sale will go to charity. A change of ownership would a huge relief from Chelsea, who have been unable to hand out new contracts and have faced an uncertain future. Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, said last week that the European champions were on “borrowed time”.",Sport/Football,Chelsea takeover: contract signed for Boehly group to end Abramovich era,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/06/chelsea-takeover-sale-contract-signed-boehly-group-abramovich
5/7/2022,"Antonio Conte says that only with time and lots of money can Tottenham hope to compete with the “monsters” at the top of the Premier League. As he prepares to take on quadruple- chasing Liverpool at Anfield on Saturday evening, while pursuing his target of finishing in a Champions League spot, the manager laid out the criteria that would see Spurs bridge the gap to becoming real contenders. “It’s not easy,” Conte said. “It’s a difficult path because now this league is tough and the gap that exists between the top teams and the other teams is an important gap. “If you have time, passion and a lot of money to invest, you can try to become competitive and to fight against these monsters. But in England there are many teams that want to invest a lot of money and try to fight for something special.” The Italian has never been shy – in any of his jobs – of calling for greater transfer spending. There have also been rumours regarding his commitment to a long-term project at Spurs. But as Conte made the case for more investment he also credited the January spending in bringing in Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur. “I think in these seven months, we did a really good job with the club and the opportunity we had also in January to sign two good players for us, to help us, to improve the quality of the team. “We signed Kulusevski and to see the capacity of this player to come into our team, like Bentancur, for us these two signings were very important. “When there is an important player, it is important to try to sign him because you know a top player will improve your team and the quality of your squad. If you want to win something, for sure you need players at the top, not medium-level players.” Jürgen Klopp likes to talk of his side as “mentality monsters” and this is perhaps a third quality that Conte sees as key to possible success. He argues that recent dropped points against Brighton and Brentford were as much about his team struggling to adapt to the position of being favourites for Champions League qualification as about playing against a low block. That attitude can be changed, he says, but only by winning. “Before the two games against Brighton and Brentford we were behind the others,” Conte said. “Then we got into the third and fourth places and we tried to defend that position. But I think this team and this group of players are improving with every aspect, also to manage the right pressure. “A lot of people speak about ‘winning mentality, winning mentality’ but you get the winning mentality when you start to win. Winning becomes a drug for you and you want to repeat it. You want to have this fantastic moment, to celebrate, to feel in this moment that you are the best. This is important.”",Sport/Football,Antonio Conte calls for time and money at Spurs to take on ‘monsters’ at the top,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/06/antonio-conte-calls-for-time-and-money-at-spurs-to-take-on-monsters-at-the-top
5/7/2022,"Given Roy Hodgson’s longstanding love of literature, he no doubt wanted the final chapter of his managerial career to have a happy ending. Sadly, it is not to be. After a nomadic and eventful existence stretching over four decades, taking in 17 clubs as well as four international sides, the 74-year-old will step into retirement this summer as the man who oversaw Watford’s second Premier League relegation in three seasons. It has been a tough denouement and for Hodgson there comes the prospect of a brutal twist. Watford sit 19th, 12 points from safety with four games to go, and will be down should they fail to beat Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Saturday afternoon. Given they have won only two of their previous 23 games and face a side who are far superior despite flatlining somewhat since last month’s FA Cup semi-final defeat to Chelsea, the odds of them being victorious are slim to say the least. This, then, is likely to be it for Watford and when the final whistle blows and the home crowd crow at the demise of a rival, their manager may well reflect on how so much has changed so quickly. After all, 12 months ago he was receiving adulation from Palace supporters having announced his departure from the club after four years as manager. Taking charge of his boyhood team had been a “fairytale” and back then he could not have envisaged his return would be in such nightmarish circumstances. “I am looking forward to going back,” Hodgson said on the eve of the game. “The reception I get might be different because I don’t think Watford has ever been one of Palace’s favourite opponents. I’m not expecting them to race out and embrace me with open arms. But I’d like to think the Palace fans know the job Ray [Lewington, Hodgson’s assistant coach] and I did for them.” It was undeniably a good job, with Hodgson steering Palace to 11th, 12th, 14th and 14th having taken charge when the club found itself goalless, pointless and directionless after the Frank de Boer fiasco. Equally, it was the right time for both parties to go their separate ways and for Hodgson that was supposed to mean calling it a day. Instead he answered Watford’s SOS in late January – or as he put it, “the siren call from the mermaid as the sailor passes by on his ship” – after they found themselves 19th having burned through another two managers in Xisco Muñoz and Claudio Ranieri since their return to the top flight. Hodgson was confident he could keep them up but, if anything, things have got worse, with Watford losing a record 11 consecutive home games and generally performing with a lack of leadership, defensive nous and attacking courage. All of which begs the question; does Hodgson regret stepping out of his slippers and back into the managerial fray? “My only regret is it didn’t work out in the way I dreamed it might,” he replied. “But I don’t regret accepting the job and I don’t regret that the send-off won’t be like the one from Crystal Palace. I’ve had 46 years in this profession and I’ve come to see if your hope and ambition is that every time you leave a job you will be carried shoulder high out of the ground then you are very naive and stupid. “At times the team has been quite hard done by and I do think there has been a change to the way we play. The biggest regret is that hasn’t led to the number of points we needed to stay up – we pinned a lot of hope on our front players but they have not been able to produce their best performances.” Hodgson announced this week, shortly after receiving a CBE for services to football, that he expects the end of the season really will mean the end of his time as a manager. His contract with Watford will be up and there is no desire to seek one elsewhere. It is time to prioritise his family and wellbeing, something brought into sharp focus on Thursday when Hodgson revealed he had shingles, which is why he wore sunglasses during last week’s defeat to Burnley. Yet for the man who began coaching at Halmstad in 1976 and has gone as far as the United Arab Emirates in search of work since there is no kicking the habit, with Hodgson suggesting he could be tempted back into football should the right job become available. “If one of the top three clubs suddenly decide it’s got to be me and they will accept nobody else other than me – who knows, I might have my arm twisted,” he said, seemingly only half-joking. “But I’m not looking for a further arm twist. I am looking forward to a rest and maybe another niche to keep my brain active and keep me feeling that I’ve got something to offer. That [role] will have to develop over time, really.” That is for the future. For now there is the end of a trying campaign for all concerned at Watford and for their manager, the 14th to be appointed by owner Gino Pozzo in the past 10 years, an especially notable trip to south London. “There will be emotion,” said Hodgson, having revealed he had dinner with Patrick Vieira shortly after the Frenchman succeeded him at Selhurst Park. “I was overwhelmed with the send-off not just from the fans, but from the club itself. I have only good things in my memory about Crystal Palace.”",Sport/Football,Roy Hodgson’s doomed Watford ending set for further brutal twist,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/06/roy-hodgson-doomed-watford-ending-set-for-further-brutal-twist
5/7/2022,"Frank Lampard has warned Everton that they cannot rely on the inspiration of Goodison Park to haul themselves out of trouble and must seize responsibility for ending their dreadful away form. Everton visit Leicester on Sunday and Watford on Wednesday in desperate need of a first away win since August as they attempt to avoid relegation. Lampard’s team kept Premier League survival in their hands with last weekend’s victory over Chelsea, and have won as many home matches this season – eight – as Thomas Tuchel’s side. Their away form is the worst in the division, however, and the Everton manager insists his team must show the same intensity on the road as they do before a passionate Goodison crowd. Lampard said: “As you saw with Liverpool in the first half at Villarreal and what happened in Madrid the next day, being at home does have a huge effect; on fans, momentum and moments. But in the position we are in, we can’t have that as our ‘out’. We can’t have so long a period without winning away from home. That has to be on us. We have to own it now and get results away in these last games.” Jordan Pickford performed heroics in the win over Chelsea and Lampard believes the wider recognition that followed for the England international is long overdue. “He lives right, he trains well – every day,” he said. “He’s very low maintenance and a good character. I’m delighted that Jordan is getting the recognition he deserves because sometimes people are very quick to jump on negatives. Last week there were big positives. “He’s got style and that’s part of his personality. One thing I would say on the outside, probably not on the pitch so much, is that if people question someone who has got personality or shows it in different ways, it’s unfair to criticise them. We like to see that, do we not? Certainly in the world of social media and instant reactions, if he’s going to have a pint with his mates then these things get blown up. That’s why it’s really nice to talk about him and what a great professional he is. “He’s a lad who has got personality and a character within the team. He’s a huge talent and that is all I have to worry about. I’m very fortunate to work with a goalkeeper of his level. He’s one of the leaders in our dressing room because of his stature and what he has done in the game.”",Sport/Football,Everton warned they cannot rely on Goodison factor to secure survival,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/06/everton-warned-they-cannot-rely-on-goodison-factor-to-secure-survival
5/7/2022,"An overhaul of what Boris Johnson described as “antiquated” mental health laws will make it harder to detain people with learning disabilities and autistic people in hospital. The reforms – which will be part of the Queen’s speech next week and are the first big changes to the Mental Health Act in four decades – are designed to reduce the number of people being detained under current laws in England and Wales. The number of detentions rose by 40% between 2005-06 and 2015-16 and have continued to rise year on year. Details of the new draft mental health bill were announced on Friday night by Downing Street, which said it met key manifesto commitments. They include ending a situation in which people with learning disabilities and autistic people can be detained under the act even if the patient does not suffer from any mental health conditions. This practice will be ended by removing learning disabilities and autism as mental health disorders. While current laws allows treatment to be imposed on patients against their wishes, the draft bill will allow them to voice a preference or refuse a specific treatment where a suitable alternative is available. Johnson said: “Our mental health laws are antiquated. Every person deserves to be treated with dignity, and it is our duty to ensure the rights and freedoms of our most vulnerable in society are protected and respected.” Downing Street said the reforms would help tackle disparities and reduce the number of people from minority ethnic backgrounds, in particular black African-Caribbean communities, detained under the act. Black people are more than four times more likely to be detained under the act and more than 10 times more likely to be subject to a community treatment order. The draft bill takes forward recommendations made by Prof Sir Simon Wessely’s 2018 independent review, which looked at how the Mental Health Act is used. Welcoming the news that the draft bill was being brought forward, Wessely said: “Undertaking pre-legislative scrutiny is a vital step in making sure the bill delivers on our ambitious plans for reform. By strengthening patient rights to influence their care and treatment, and to choose who supports them, we can improve people’s experience of mental health services, address current significant racial disparities and combat rising rates of detention.” The draft legislation also includes proposals to rebalance the threshold for detention – by ensuring that decisions must balance risk to the public and therapeutic benefit to the patient – and ensuring that all patients receive a timely plan on care and the route to their discharge. It also proposes reducing the use of community treatment orders, which mean people remain supervised in their community and can be sent back to hospital, and which can include restrictions such as where a person has to live. The Department of Health and Social Care is running a call for evidence seeking views before a new 10-year mental health plan and updated national suicide prevention plan. Downing Street said work to reform mental health services continued, after a government investment of £400m to eradicate outdated dormitories in mental health facilities, although health professionals and others recently have also been seeking new investment in mental health services more broadly. The pandemic has led to a dramatic rise in the numbers of people experiencing mental health problems, with 1.6 million waiting for specialised treatment and another 8 million who would benefit from support unable to get on the waiting list.",News/Politics,‘Antiquated’ mental health laws in England and Wales set for overhaul,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/06/antiquated-mental-health-laws-in-england-and-wales-set-for-overhaul
5/7/2022,"Ralf Rangnick has revealed his request to sign a striker in January was rejected by Manchester United despite the interim manager wanting cover after losing Mason Greenwood and Anthony Martial. Greenwood was arrested on 30 January on suspicion of rape, assault and threats to kill and suspended indefinitely, and a few days earlier Martial had joined Sevilla on loan. Rangnick says he had identified players including Luis Díaz, Dusan Vlahovic and River Plate’s Julián Álvarez as potential January targets but that when he asked the executive to assess adding a reinforcement he was told the market was closed. “I still believe that we should have tried in those 48 hours,” Rangnick said. “The board [at the time] sees it the same way – they agreed – but they also spoke to the scouting department at the same time. Maybe we should have tried to sign a player in these 48 hours since we knew Mason wouldn’t be available and Anthony Martial had already left on loan … But we didn’t. Maybe I should have pushed even more in order to get this additional striker. “The answer at the time was: ‘No, there is no player on the market that can really help us.’” Díaz joined Liverpool on 30 January and a day later City said they had signed Álvarez. Juventus had announced Vlahovic’s arrival on 28 January. Rangnick wonders whether United’s season could have unfolded more successfully if a forward had been added. He said of players on his list: “There were a few: Díaz who is now at Liverpool, Álvarez who will be at Man City in the summer, Vlahovic who at the time was with Fiorentina. “So those are just three of them that come across my mind now. The answer was no and that was it. We were still in three competitions: the FA Cup, the Champions League, at the time were fourth in the league. “I spoke to the board and told them: ‘Shouldn’t we at least speak and analyse and find if we can at least get a player, on loan or a permanent deal?’ In the end the answer was no. “Maybe they didn’t want to do any winter [business]. Forty-eight hours is 48 hours. “It might have been at least worth to try and internally discuss it. We didn’t.” It is understood that United’s policy of only signing a player in January who is a target for the summer was a factor that precluded a search for a forward. There was a concern, too, that any addition could affect the next manager’s close-season business and make the squad even more disjointed. There is also a questioning of Rangnick’s time frame of 48 hours to find a replacement. United’s announced they had suspended Greenwood a little more than 31 hours before the deadline, although they had been aware of the allegations against him at least seven hours before that, and a reason why Jesse Lingard’s proposed loan move to Newcastle was not allowed was because the football department viewed him as forward cover. Rangnick dismissed criticism regarding his treatment of Lingard, who did not get a farewell Old Trafford appearance against Brentford on Monday. “In the last couple of weeks under my tenure he has played far more games than he used to,” he said.",Sport/Football,Manchester United’s Rangnick claims January striker signing was vetoed,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/06/manchester-uniteds-rangnick-claims-january-striker-signing-was-vetoed
5/7/2022,"Thomas Tuchel says he has overseen a reset of his Chelsea squad during their first clear week in almost three months after fearing they had lost their edge. Since the international break at the end of March, Tuchel’s team have taken seven points from an available 18 in the Premier League and gone out of the Champions League, losing to Real Madrid in the quarter-finals. They were able to beat Crystal Palace to reach the FA Cup final. Tuchel fretted about Chelsea’s grip on a top-four place – something that had looked secure – after last Sunday’s defeat at Everton, and before Saturday’s home game against Wolves he opened up about a dip in standards. “You analyse the data and you see on a physical level that we drop intensity, we drop kilometres, we drop actually effort,” Tuchel said. “So you ask yourself: ‘Should I have been aware of it before? Should I have changed more positions, fresher legs? Where did it come from?’ “We play tomorrow for tomorrow. This is the mentality and lately, after the international break, we struggled with the focus on this very match. We struggled at Manchester United [in the 1-1 draw on the Thursday of last week] … maybe a bit too much praise for only one point and then it can be a bit too comfortable. This is what I feel and what I saw in the Everton match.” Tuchel cited the takeover saga at the club and the remorseless of the schedule as reasons for the toils. He said: “Maybe the team had a bit the feeling that we have not so much to win, not so much to lose [in the league] – you maybe lose the edge. This can be enough to lose matches and lose confidence.” The previous time that Chelsea did not have a midweek game was after the Club World Cup final victory over Palmeiras on 12 February. This week, Tuchel has put his players through proper training sessions on three consecutive days and “not like recovery, recovery and match day minus one be careful”. They have played small-sided tournaments, where the intensity has been high and the results important, according to Tuchel, rather than “only tactical and possession games”. Tuchel discussed the notion of a reset. “It is a little bit like that,” he said. “It was the time to do it. Let’s start from scratch and see who’s ready for Saturday. It’s not to install something new, it’s just to re-find it. It’s a normal process during such a long season and we are at that very point so the reaction tomorrow is important. “You need to come up with solutions and, in my experience, it is most of the time on the training pitch. You can talk about it and hold speeches and show videos, but it’s the best thing to react on the training pitch.”",Sport/Football,Thomas Tuchel uses rare clear week to ‘start from scratch’ in Chelsea reset,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/06/thomas-tuchel-uses-rare-clear-week-to-start-from-scratch-in-chelsea-reset
