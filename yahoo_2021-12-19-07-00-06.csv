12/19/2021,"The former governor of Montana and head of the Republican National Committee said the US republic could be ""at risk."" He said he noticed a shift over the past decade-and-a-half due, in part, to social-media platforms. ""It seems almost impossible to me to manage the noise,"" he said, according to the Casper Star-Tribune. Marc Racicot, the former governor of Montana and head of the Republican National Committee, said the future of the US republic was ""at risk"" due to the changing culture in the country, and due to social-media platforms. According to a report Saturday from the Capser Star-Tribune, Racicot made the comments at the 100th annual meeting of the Montana Taxpayers Association, which was held December 8. Racicot was the event's luncheon speaker, according to a report from the Independent Record. ""The most probable way for our republic to vanish is through a lack of honor and fidelity. Not surprisingly that is precisely what is required by our constitutional oath of office,"" the Republican said, according to the Star-Tribune. Racicot, 73, served as head of the RNC from 2002 to 2003 and before that was the state attorney general from 1989 to 1993 and the governor from 1993 to 2001, the report said. ""Fidelity is the exact opposite of seeking power for its own sake, which as history reveals, at the end of the day, is really a fool's errand,"" Racicot said at the luncheon, according to the Star-Tribune. ""Without accepting, embracing and discharging one's duties as guided by fidelity, it is inevitable that the life of our republic will over time, like grains of sand passing through an hourglass, be at risk,"" he added. Racicot last year in an interview with Yellowstone Public Radio said he planned to cast a ballot for now President Joe Biden, the Democratic candidate, saying of former President Donald Trump ""at the end, the content of a man's character or a woman's character to serve in that capacity is more important than any other issue that I have to consider as a matter of conscience."" He also said he hadn't voted for Trump in 2016, either, adding he had more concerns about him last year than four years prior. He also said that the relationship between people in the US and their neighbors had shifted, and said that social-media had made it more difficult to effectively communicate and understand each other's differences. ""That's how much of the country and much of the world talks to each other these days,"" he said at the December 8 event of social-media platforms. ""It's dizzying, it's vacuous and it's perilous."" ""It seems almost impossible to me to manage the noise, to control the flood of unverified and frequently inaccurate communications, conceived in anger and competition and then regretted because of all the blathering that is now a matter of public record,"" he added, according to the report.

12/19/2021,"ROME (AP) — Pope Francis doubled down Saturday on his efforts to quash the old Latin Mass, forbidding the celebration of some sacraments according to the ancient rite in his latest salvo against conservatives and traditionalists. The Vatican’s liturgy office issued a document that clarified some questions that arose after Francis in July reimposed restrictions on celebrating the old Latin Mass that Pope Benedict XVI had relaxed in 2007. Francis said then that he was reversing his predecessor because Benedict’s reform had become a source of division in the church and been exploited by Catholics opposed to the Second Vatican Council, the 1960s meetings that modernized the church and its liturgy. The Vatican repeated that rationale on Saturday, saying the clarifications and new restrictions were necessary to preserve the unity of the church and its sacraments. “As pastors we must not lend ourselves to sterile polemics, capable only of creating division, in which the ritual itself is often exploited by ideological viewpoints,” said the prefect of the Vatican's liturgy office, Archbishop Arthur Roche, in an introductory note to the world's bishops. Francis’ crackdown on the old Mass has outraged his conservative critics, many of whom have gone so far to accuse him of heresy and watering down Catholic doctrine with his focus on the environment, social justice and migrants. Francis says he preaches the Gospel and what Jesus taught, and has defended the restrictions by saying they actually reflect Benedict's original goal while curbing the way his 2007 concession had been exploited for ideological ends. His July law required individual bishops to approve celebrations of the old Mass, also called the Tridentine Mass, and required newly ordained priests to receive explicit permission to celebrate it from their bishops, in consultation with the Vatican. Saturday's decree makes clear the Vatican must explicitly authorize new priests to celebrate the rite. In addition, the new document Saturday imposes restrictions targeting the sacramental life of the church. It forbids using the ancient ritual for the sacraments of Confirmation and ordaining new priests, and will make it exceedingly difficult for traditionalists to access the sacraments of Baptism, Marriage and Anointing of the Sick according to the old rite. This de facto prohibition arises because these sacraments can only be celebrated in so-called personal parishes that were already in existence and dedicated to traditionalist communities. There are exceedingly few of these parishes around the world, and Francis barred the creation of new ones. “Roche Christmas Massacre,” tweeted Rorate Caeli, a traditionalist blog that has been critical of Francis and his crackdown on the Tridentine rite. “Benedict XVI had brought peace to the church. An end to the liturgical wars,"" the group said in a follow-up message to The Associated Press. ""The current pope has chosen to reignite them. There is no logical reason for that. Just an underlying desire for division and violence.” Francis agreed to the publication of the document, which was signed by Roche, who is prefect of the Vatican’s liturgy office. It was written in the form of questions and answers, including some that get into minute details that make clear the Vatican's effort to minimize the spread of the old Mass: Parishes may not, for example, publicize the celebration of the old liturgy in parish bulletins or allow them to be celebrated at the same time as the so-called New Order Mass. In a clear bid to dissuade seminarians from even learning the old rite, the new instruction urges seminary teachers to lead their charges “to an understanding and experience of the richness of the liturgical reform called for by the Second Vatican Council.” If a priest who is authorized to celebrate the old rite gets sick at the last minute, he can't be substituted with one who doesn't have prior approval. In addition, priests may not celebrate an old rite Mass and the New Order one on the same day. Joseph Shaw, head of the Latin Mass Society of England and Wales, said the restrictions mean celebration of the old Latin Mass “will become extremely difficult"" and the sacraments even more so. “This would drastically reduce the number of celebrations, and cause great pastoral harm,"" he said in an email.",World/Associated Press,Pope doubles down on quashing old Latin Mass with new limits,https://news.yahoo.com/pope-doubles-down-quashing-old-110637870.html
