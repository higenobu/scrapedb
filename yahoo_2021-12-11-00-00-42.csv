12/11/2021,"The fight against the coronavirus is an ongoing concern and is being tackled on many fronts. Arbutus Biopharma (ABUS) is another company in the hunt for solutions, and on Tuesday, the biotech announced it had achieved the first milestone based on its agreement with X-Chem and Proteros biostructures on the road to advancing an oral pan-coronavirus treatment. The company disclosed that it has identified a number of potent and selective small molecules which inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 main protease (Mpro), an essential protein needed for viral replication and a validated target for the treatment of Covid-19 and possible future outbreaks of the coronavirus. Given this milestone has been reached, Arbutus is set to gain the exclusive worldwide license to the identified molecules but in exchange must make an undisclosed but nominal milestone payment to X-Chem and Proteros. The collaborators have concluded the screening process of X-Chem's considerable Mpro inhibitor library. Now, making use of Proteros' state-of-the-art structure guided methods, they are now advancing into the lead optimization stage. Following which, Arbutus will look to further develop a promising candidate – or candidates - including moving forward to clinical studies. “We expect more guidance from the company on the timeline for this important program in January 2022,” said H.C. Wainwright analyst Ed Arce. “While this program is still quite early, we are encouraged by the rapid progress and continue to recognize the significant potential value of an oral pan-coronavirus treatment, even several years from now.” The announcement follows on from another recent positive development. Earlier this month, the company released preliminary data from the ongoing Phase 1a/1b clinical study of AB-836, Arbutus’ next-generation oral capsid inhibitor and indicated as a therapy for chronic hepatitis B viru B virus (cHBV). The data showed the drug was generally safe and well-tolerated, while indicating strong antiviral activity. Arce believes the early signs are “very promising.” “While this is preliminary data and the sample size (n=4) is quite small,” the analyst said, “We believe that if this robust antiviral activity at a relatively low dose is confirmed at the final result (n=10) and in other higher-dose cohorts, AB-836 may emerge with a clinical profile that is not only generally safe and well-tolerated, but also strongly efficacious and highly competitive with other HBV capsid/core inhibitors.” These developments underpin Arce’s Buy rating and $8 price target, suggesting room for ~8`0% share appreciation form current levels.

According to the $7 average price target, shares will be changing hands for a 60% premium a year from now.

12/11/2021,"Bitcoin’s massive swings aren’t for everyone, but one investing shark is hungry for more cryptocurrency: Kevin O’Leary. The O’Shares ETFs chairman and Shark Tank personality bought his first coin in 2017 and has been picking up speed ever since. “I’ve grown the portfolio remarkably,” O’Leary told his audience during a Reddit Talk session last month. “At the beginning of the year, I was at 3% weighting. The target was to get 7% by year-end. However, because of the appreciation of so many of the assets I have now, we’re almost at 10% today.” However, O’Leary’s largest investment fund, O’Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF (OUSA), doesn’t invest in crypto at all. Instead, it seeks businesses with strong profitability, balance sheets and dividend growth. If you’re looking to diversify your crypto-heavy portfolio with income-producing stocks, take a look at the top three holdings of O’Leary’s flagship fund. And if none of those appeal, O’Leary also invests in plenty of alternative assets. Home Depot may not seem as exciting as crypto, but it’s the top holding at OUSA, accounting for 6.1% of the fund’s weight. The home improvement retail giant has around 2,300 stores, with each one averaging approximately 105,000 square feet of indoor retail space, dwarfing many competitors. And while other brick-and-mortar retailers have floundered during the pandemic, Home Depot grew its sales nearly 20% in fiscal 2020 to $132.1 billion. It even boosted its quarterly dividend by 10% earlier this year and now yields 1.6%. Shares aren’t cheap, though. After rallying more than 55% year to date, Home Depot trades at over $400 per share. But you can always get a smaller piece of the company using a popular app that allows you to buy fractions of shares with as much money as you are willing to spend. Tech stocks aren’t known for their dividends, but software gorilla Microsoft is an exception. The company announced an 11% increase to its quarterly dividend to 62 cents per share in September. Over the past five years, its payout has grown by 59%. So it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Microsoft is the second-largest holding in O’Leary’s OUSA. Business has been booming of late, partially driven by the pandemic-fueled demand for its cloud-computing and video-gaming offerings. In the September quarter, Microsoft's revenue grew 22% year-over-year to $45.3 billion while adjusted earnings per share surged 25% to $2.27. Year-to-date, Microsoft shares have returned an impressive 53%, easily topping other trillion-dollar tech giants like Apple (31%) and Amazon (11%). Still, if you’re hesitant to go deep on tech stocks near all-time highs, you can always build a diversified portfolio automatically just by using your “spare change.” Procter & Gamble belongs to a group of companies commonly known as the Dividend Kings: publicly traded businesses with at least 50 consecutive years of dividend increases. In fact, P&G makes the list with ease. In April, the board of directors announced a 10% increase to the quarterly payout, marking the company’s 65th consecutive annual dividend hike. It’s not hard to see why the company is able to maintain such a streak. P&G is a consumer staples giant with a portfolio of trusted brands like Bounty paper towels, Crest toothpaste, Gillette razor blades and Tide detergent. These are products households buy on a regular basis, no matter how the economy or their personal finances are faring. Thanks to the recession-resistant nature of P&G’s business, it can deliver reliable dividends through thick and thin. Shares are up 10% year-to-date. That may not seem like much compared to Home Depot and Microsoft, but long-term investors can look back on many decades of strong performance. The company offers an annual dividend yield of 2.3% and is currently the third-largest holding in OUSA with a weighting of 4.8%. Dividends provide a great source of passive income, but you don’t have to limit yourself to the stock market. These days, retail investors have access to a variety of alternative investments, many of which offer impressive cash income. Traditionally, these opportunities have been available only to the ultra rich, like O’Leary. But now, with the help of new platforms, a single $500 investment can build a fixed-income portfolio spread across multiple asset classes that include fine art, commercial real estate and even marine finance.
