Annette L. Goodyear of North East, on crossing guard duty on Friday, holding up a hand to stop traffic. As a middle school student walked through the crosswalk, a car blew into the intersection. Goodyear pushed the child out of the way only to be hit by the car herself. Although the footage shows her falling hard to the pavement, Cecil County Public Schools Superintendent Jeffrey Lawson said on Twitter that Goodyear was treated and released and is doing well. “It was strange. As I’m lying there I’m thinking to myself this actually did happen. I didn’t even know what to think about at that point,” Goodyear told Fox 5. “It didn’t seem real as it was happening.” The child was not injured. CBS Baltimore reported that the driver was given multiple citations, including negligent driving, failure to stop for a pedestrian in the crosswalk and an expired registration. The town’s website said Goodyear has been with the department since 2008, and was its first female officer. Goodyear told Fox 5 that after leaving the hospital, she went to check on the girl, who was too shaken to go to school and went home instead. “She came down the stairs saw me standing there and as she was walking toward the door she was getting teary-eyed, and you could see it and when she got teary-eyed, then her dad started getting teary-eyed, and we all started at that point,” Goodyear told the station. “I was just so thankful she was standing there and that she was OK.” This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.",U.S./HuffPost,Hero Crossing Guard Hailed For Incredible Reflexes After Saving Kid From Car,https://news.yahoo.com/hero-crossing-guard-hailed-incredible-093945272.html
2/7/2022,"The pandemic is the primary reason former President Donald Trump is no longer in the White House. It may also prevent him from returning, but for totally different reasons. In 2020, Trump was viewed as lax and incompetent in his COVID-19 response by a critical mass of voters. President Biden won among those whose top issue was the pandemic or who prioritized controlling the virus over reopening the economy by at least 60 points. For many of the suburbanites who decided the election, it was the last straw. (This is without getting into whether the COVID voting protocols themselves worked to Trump's disadvantage.) If Trump runs again in 2024, he may face the opposite COVID critique in the Republican primaries: that he was too supportive of letting the pandemic change the way Americans lived. Although he later chafed at them, Trump backed the lockdowns. (The Biden White House is now presenting them as a Trump policy, not something Democratic elected officials or their preferred public health authorities championed.) He elevated Anthony Fauci into an expert on all things COVID. Even his role in developing the vaccines is an area of disagreement with some allies. Ambitious Republicans, like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, appear to notice that this is a rare Trump vulnerability with GOP voters. And Trump seems to recognize that Operation Warp Speed may not fire up Team MAGA in the same fashion as ""build the wall."" Rank-and-file Republicans are over COVID. They are second-guessing the economic interruption of 2020, especially as even some liberal jurisdictions are beginning to relax their policies. There is no guarantee any of this will make the party revisit its steadfast backing of Trump. But it's one of the more promising possibilities for his potential primary opponents than another Evan McMullin-style candidacy. It's unfortunate that Trump's greatest achievement could hurt him. Some in the GOP have outflanked him on the fight against business closures and mandates. And while vaccine skeptics are a minority among Republicans, they are a persistent one. COVID is roiling some conservative political parties internationally. Trump's Republicans may be no different.

2/7/2022,"By Wa Lone (Reuters) - Every day for the last three months, an average of six or seven families in Myanmar have posted notices in the country's state-owned newspapers cutting ties with sons, daughters, nieces, nephews and grandchildren who have publicly opposed the ruling military junta. The notices started to appear in such numbers in November after the army, which seized power from Myanmar's democratically elected government a year ago, announced it would take over properties of its opponents and arrest people giving shelter to protesters. Scores of raids on homes followed. Lin Lin Bo Bo, a former car salesman who joined an armed group resisting military rule, was one of those disowned by his parents in about 570 notices reviewed by Reuters. ""We declare we have disowned Lin Lin Bo Bo because he never listened to his parents' will,"" said the notice posted by his parents, San Win and Tin Tin Soe, in state-owned newspaper The Mirror in November. Speaking to Reuters from a Thai border town where he is living after fleeing Myanmar, the 26-year-old said his mother had told him she was disowning him after soldiers came to their family home searching for him. A few days later, he said he cried as he read the notice in the paper. ""My comrades tried to reassure me that it was inevitable for families to do that under pressure,"" he told Reuters. ""But I was so heartbroken."" Contacted by Reuters, his parents declined to comment. Targeting families of opposition activists was a tactic used by Myanmar's military during unrest in 2007 and the late 1980s but has been used far more frequently since the Feb.1, 2021 coup, according to Wai Hnin Pwint Thon, senior advocacy officer at rights group Burma Campaign UK, which uses the old name for the former British colony. Publicly disowning family members, which has a long history in Myanmar's culture, is one way to respond, said Wai Hnin Pwint Thon, who said she was seeing more such notices in the press than in the past. ""Family members are scared to be implicated in crimes,"" she said. ""They don't want to be arrested, and they don't want to be in trouble."" A military spokesperson did not respond to Reuters questions for this story. Commenting on the notices in a news conference in November, military spokesperson Zaw Min Tun said that people who made such declarations in newspapers could still be charged if found to be supporting opposition to the junta. VIOLENT CRACKDOWN Hundreds of thousands of people in Myanmar, many of them young, took to the streets to protest the coup a year ago. After a violent crackdown on demonstrations by the army, some protesters fled overseas or joined armed groups in remote parts of the country. Known as People's Defence Forces, these groups are broadly aligned with the deposed civilian government. Over the past year, security forces have killed about 1,500 people, many of them demonstrators, and arrested nearly 12,000 people, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a monitoring group. The military has said those figures are exaggerated. Journalist So Pyay Aung told Reuters he filmed riot police using batons and shields to break up protests and livestreamed the video on the Democratic Voice of Burma, a news website. After authorities came searching for him, he said he hid in different locations in Myanmar before fleeing to Thailand with his wife and infant daughter. He was disowned by his father in November. ""I declare I am disowning my son because he did unforgivable activities against his parents' wills. I will not have any responsibilities related to him,"" said a notice posted by his father, Tin Aung Ko, in the state-owned Myanma Alinn newspaper. ""When I saw the newspaper that mentioned cutting ties with me, I felt a little sad,"" So Pyay Aung told Reuters. ""But I understand that my parents had fears of pressure. They might have worries of their house being seized or getting arrested."" His father, Tin Aung Ko, declined to comment. Two parents who disowned their children in similar notices, who asked not to be named for fear of attracting the attention of the military, told Reuters the notices were primarily intended to send a message to authorities that they should not be held responsible for their children's actions. ""My daughter is doing what she believes, but I'm sure she will be worried if we got into trouble,"" one mother said. ""I know she can understand what I have done to her."" Lin Lin Bo Bo said he hopes to one day go home and support his family. ""I want this revolution to be over as soon as possible,"" he told Reuters. Such a reunification may be possible for some families torn apart in this way, according to Wai Hnin Pwint Thon, the rights activist. ""Unless they do it properly with lawyers and a will, then these things don't really count legally,"" she said of the disowning notices. ""After a couple of years, they can go back to being family."" So Pyay Aung, the journalist, said he fears his split with his parents is permanent. ""I don't even have a home to go back to after the revolution,"" he told Reuters. ""I am so worried all the time because my parents are left under the military regime.""

2/7/2022,"In May 2020, I injured my ankle so badly I couldn’t move a toe. The slightest twitch sent a paralyzing bolt through my leg—like head-splitting microphone feedback that makes you recoil and cover your ears. That’s what back labor felt like—but in my spine. My baby was “sunny side up”—a vaguely appetizing term that meant his head was pushing against my spine. Every time I had a contraction, it felt like my back was breaking. The pain felt unfair—like an injustice. Surely, this must be against some law! I thought, followed quickly by, I must call the head of the hospital! As the pain intensified, it became, I need to call the police! Finally, I landed on the president. Actually, scratch that. Kamala. She’d know what to do. Madam Vice President, if there’s any way you could put in a call to my uterus and ask this kid his ETA? See if he’d consider assuming a more comfortable position? I’m sure you have friends in high places, soooo… I was in labor for so long I genuinely forgot I was in the hospital to have a baby. The pain had taken over, and I thought my life was just going to be about managing it. The doctors had already tried to give me an epidural, but it didn’t work, so my options were limited: I begged the doctors to try the epidural one more time. (They couldn’t.) I begged my husband to squeeze my hips every time I had a contraction. (He did.) I begged Siri to turn on my “Breathe & Chill” playlist. (She said I had to unlock my phone first. We haven’t spoken since.) Colbert Goes Off on SCOTUS Over ‘Roe’ Challenge: ‘We Don’t Live in a Democracy’ Just when I believed I was at the very end of my rope, the nurse told me I was ready to push. And I did. For two glorious hours, I pushed like a champion. Between pushes, I cracked jokes. I told the nurses this is how I should record my stand-up special. When else would I get such a captive audience? I was sweaty, exhausted and hilarious—even if only to myself. My baby arrived slimy, half-covered in his own poop, and heavy as a bowling ball. As the nurse placed his little, loud body on my chest, I remembered why I was there and why I’d gone through all this. I remembered that this was what I had chosen to do. I wanted to create a family. I knew that this was the first of many ginormous sacrifices I would make in my son’s life. For me, birth was bearable because I had chosen it. I could only manage the nausea, pain, and expenses (financial and emotional) of pregnancy because I wanted a child. Now that I’ve experienced a full-term pregnancy and given birth, I find myself thinking about how imprisoning it would be to go through this if I didn’t choose it. If I was forced into it because laws didn’t give me any other option. Unfortunately—terrifyingly—this isn’t some far-off dystopian thought experiment. In 2021 alone, 600 abortion restrictions were introduced across the country; 90 were enacted into law. That’s more than any year since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973. And right now, the Supreme Court is deliberating a case that could overturn Roe v. Wade. This is not a drill, people. All of us with a uterus may soon be stripped of the constitutional right to an abortion. Forced pregnancy and birth sounds medieval—as medieval as secret, unsafe abortions. And yet, here we are. My life as I know it, and motherhood as I know it, was shaped by my right to make choices about my own body. In that way, my birth story is inseparable from my abortion story. Ten years ago, I was pregnant for the first time. I was living in an apartment I could barely afford with my first boyfriend out of college. We were doing whatever it took to get by. I was taking random babysitting jobs, working at a smoothie shop, and performing improv in tiny LA theaters as often as anyone would allow me on stage. I accidentally missed a day or two of my birth control, and my period was late. So, I did what countless women have done since pioneer times: I bought a two-pack of pregnancy tests, took them right there in the drug store bathroom, and buried the positive results in the trash underneath some wet paper towels. I immediately knew the right thing to do was to have an abortion. There was no handwringing, no confusion, no sleepless nights. I’ve always had a strong moral compass—the kind that sets off blaring sirens and flashing red lights in my chest if I feel like I’m doing something wrong. In this case, all was silent. My compass pointed very clearly in the direction of not bringing a child into the world that I did not want and could not care for. Within two weeks, I had a safe procedure in my doctor’s office, and it was no big deal. My abortion story is uncomplicated and straightforward, based on a decision that was all my own. I understand this is a privilege. I also understand that access to abortion should never be a privilege; it should be a protected right. Over the past decade, I’ve hardly thought about my abortion, except for when I think of those who may not have access to one. Abortion restrictions disproportionately harm those already most vulnerable in our country—from Black, Latino, and Indigenous communities to young people, immigrants, those living in poverty, and rural areas. This comes as no surprise. Marginalized Americans have always been the most impacted by racist and classist reproductive policies throughout history. I’m haunted by the prospect of what we all stand to lose. If the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, half of U.S. states could control our personal reproductive decisions by summer. Over 36 million people could be forced to give birth. Becoming a mother has made me even more adamant about access to safe, legal abortions. I now know how hard it is to carry a bowling ball-sized human to full term. I know the back-breaking will it takes to give birth to a baby. I know the toll of sleepless nights and a torn body, the necessity of support, the pause it puts on your career, relationships, and goals. I cannot fathom the cruelty of enduring all this plus a lifetime of childrearing if you do not want it. I wouldn’t wish the labor pain I experienced on anyone. Okay, except maybe the politicians who continue to use their power to try to strip us of our rights. But I wish this for them in a benevolent way. Maybe laboring would grow their empathy toward those of us whose bodies they use as talking points in their re-election campaigns. Activists hold a clothes hanger at a rally in front of the U.S. Supreme Court on Jan. 22, 2022, in Washington, D.C. It’s never been more apparent to me that the abortion “debate” is not about life or even policy; it’s about power. And while I don’t have the power to cast a vote in the Supreme Court case, I do have the power to raise my voice as one of the nearly 25 percent of women who will have an abortion in their lifetime. So, as we approach the 49th Anniversary of Roe v Wade, I am telling you all these personal details because I believe in the power of our stories to offer perspective. And more than that, the ability of our actions to create protections for everyone. Deep down, I think most Americans understand that we should all have the freedom and power to make choices about our bodies, lives, and futures. It’s 2022! I want to shout at my newsfeed. How could we live in a country where people are forced into doing something so life-altering, so personal? But shouting just wakes up the baby and accomplishes little else. Instead, we need to take action. The Senate will soon vote on the Women’s Health Protection Act (WHPA). This is critical legislation that would protect the right to abortion throughout the country. I’m calling my senators and urging them to pass the Women’s Health Protection Act. I hope you’ll join me. We need to get their attention every way we know how—email, letters, calls, protests, and, of course, that one precious vote we each have. For so many reasons, I am grateful for the beautifully boring abortion I had and the essential health care I received. Mainly because today, I can show up for my little person with open arms knowing I’ve chosen our life together. Read more at The Daily Beast.
