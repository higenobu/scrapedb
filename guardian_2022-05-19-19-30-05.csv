5/19/2022,"Good morning. As parents across the country continue to struggle to find infant formula to feed their babies, Joe Biden yesterday invoked the Defense Production Act to speed production of infant formula and authorized flights to import supply from overseas. “I know parents across the country are worried about finding enough formula to feed their babies,” Biden said in a video statement released by the White House. “As a parent and as a grandparent, I know just how stressful that is.” The 1950 law requires suppliers of formula manufacturers to fulfil orders from those companies before other customers. Biden also authorized the defense department to use commercial aircraft to fly formula supplies that meet federal standards from overseas to the US, in what the White House is calling “Operation Fly Formula”. Meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration is streamlining its review process to make it easier for foreign manufacturers to begin shipping more formula into the US. At the start of May, 43% of baby formula was out of stock at retailers. Read more here on how this crisis came to be. The war in Ukraine, which was previously known as the world’s bread basket, has helped stoke a global food crisis that could go on for years if left unchecked, the United Nations warned, as the World Bank announced an additional $12bn in funding to mitigate its “devastating effects”. Before the invasion in February, Ukraine exported 4.5m tons of agricultural produce a month through its ports – 12% of the planet’s wheat, 15% of its corn and half of its sunflower oil. With the country’s ports cut off by Russian warships, the supply can travel only on congested, far less efficient land routes, which has caused the price of food to skyrocket. “Let’s be clear: there is no effective solution to the food crisis without reintegrating Ukraine’s food production,” the UN secretary general, António Guterres, said. “Russia must permit the safe and secure export of grain stored in Ukrainian ports.” Thomas Lane, a former Minneapolis police officer, pleaded guilty yesterday to manslaughter in the murder of George Floyd in a plea agreement that will have him spend three years in state prison. Lane’s plea agreement comes a year after his former colleague Derek Chauvin, who was recorded by a bystander killing Floyd by kneeling on his neck, was convicted of murder and sentenced to more than two decades in prison. Lane and the former officers J Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao were convicted in federal court in February of violating Floyd’s civil rights, but sentences have not yet been handed down for them. GrubHub decided to offer free lunch to everyone in the New York and Tri-State area on Tuesday, resulting in catastrophe for restaurants and delivery workers. The White House is preparing for a North Korean missile or nuclear test while Biden is in South Korea and Japan this week. US traffic deaths soared to the highest totals in 16 years, with nearly 43,000 people were killed on US roads last year. With the protections enshrined by Roe v Wade likely to be struck down, Indigenous women, girls and all those who give birth – a demographic that already experiences higher rates of violence than their counterparts – are particularly at risk of increased violence and death, warned one of the leading research institutes on Indigenous and Alaska Native people across the US. “Our people are going to suffer,” Abigail Echo-Hawk, director of the Urban Indian Health Institute, told the Guardian. The Rev Peter Cook has been a constant presence at prayer gatherings and public memorials since the racist shooting that killed 10 people on Saturday in Buffalo. He has a difficult message he is trying to get through to the country: that it’s the responsibility of white Christian denominations to challenge white America’s relationship with God and guns that is intertwined with white supremacy. Brad Raffensperger became the hero of the 2020 presidential election when he, as a Republican serving as Georgia’s top election official, resisted Donald Trump’s demands to overturn the election result. But now he’s facing a re-election of his own. Can he survive Trump’s ire? On Earth Day this year, Wynn Bruce, a 50-year-old photographer who lived in Boulder, Colorado, set himself on fire on the steps of the US supreme court. His grisly self-immolation was frighteningly similar to that of David Buckel, a civil rights lawyer who, four years earlier, walked to New York City’s Prospect Park, doused himself with gasoline and set himself alight. Buckel had left a two-page note emailed to media outlets minutes before his death stating that “my early death by fossil fuel reflects what we are doing to ourselves”. Few people worried about the climate crisis are driven to self-harm over it, yet research has shown that many are struggling with anxiety over it. “Living in climate truth is like living in a nightmare. It’s absolutely horrible and I can understand why the vast majority of Americans don’t do it,” said Margaret Klein Salamon, a clinical psychologist turned climate activist. “But the worst part is that everyone’s acting normal – it’s like we are zombies. The sense of helplessness and hopelessness is holding back conversations and political action.” Want more environmental stories delivered to your inbox?

In 1998, group of pro-choice activists began running ads warning of a dystopian future where Roe v Wade would be overturned. The activists feared that this new generation who had never known a pre-Roe world would come of age unaware of what a pre-Roe world looked like – or without understanding just how precarious abortion rights always have been in the US. The vivid images are hauntingly jarring – and far too prescient, given what is happening today with the supreme court and the leaked decision that will probably strike down the protections enshrined by Roe v Wade.

5/19/2022,"The Metropolitan police have completed their investigation into lockdown-breaching parties in Downing Street and Whitehall, and issued a total of 126 fixed-penalty notices, the force has announced. Thus far Boris Johnson has received one fine. It is not immediately clear if any of the last tranche of fines involve any more for the prime minister. The Met said it had imposed fines for events on eight dates. However, on several of these, more than one event took place. The Met said that of the 12 events referred to it for investigation, “all resulted or will do so in a FPN being issued”. If Johnson ends up receiving only one fine it could bring him political respite, given predictions he could be punished multiple times. But the end of the police investigation heralds the publication of the full report into illicit gatherings by the senior civil servant Sue Gray. An interim version of Gray’s report was published, but the full details were delayed for the police investigation, and could be damning for Johnson and his team. Of the 126 fines, 53 involved men and 73 women, with some people receiving more than one fixed-penalty notice. The Met has not identified any of the people fined, although Downing Street pledged to say if Johnson or the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, were penalised. The Met’s acting deputy commissioner, Helen Ball, said that 28 people had received multiple fines, ranging from two to five fines each. She said 97 fines had so far been paid, and none of those outstanding were beyond the 28-day period people have to pay. Ball said police had no objection to the full Gray report now being released. Johnson and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, were among people fined for attending a brief birthday party for the prime minister in the cabinet room on 19 June 2020. The eight dates for which fines have been issued are: 20 May 2020, when “bring your own booze” drinks were held in the Downing Street garden. 18 June 2020, when a party was held to mark the departure of a No 10 private secretary. 19 June, the date of Johnson’s birthday party, for which he was fined. 13 November 2020, when a leaving do was held for adviser Lee Cain as well as a party in the No 10 flat. 17 December 2020 when several parties were held, including one to mark the departure of Covid taskforce boss Kate Josephs. 18 December, the date of the “cheese and wine” gathering which led to the resignation of Allegra Stratton. 14 January 2021, when gatherings were held to mark the departure of two private secretaries, as revealed by Sue Gray. 16 April, the eve of Prince Philip’s funeral, when two parties were held, one of which culminated in Wilfred Johnson’s swing being broken. In its statement, the Met said that while it did not routinely investigate historical Covid breaches, it would do so if there was evidence those involved knew they were breaking rules, where the case was clear, and “where not investigating would significantly undermine the legitimacy of the law”. The investigation saw 12 detectives work through 345 documents, including emails, door logs, diary entries and witness statements, 510 photographs and CCTV images and 204 questionnaires. Ball said: “There is no doubt that the pandemic impacted all of us in so many ways and strong feelings and opinions have been expressed on this particular issue. “When Covid regulations were introduced, the Met was clear that whilst we would not routinely investigate breaches of regulations retrospectively, there may be occasions when it would be appropriate to do so. “The information that we received with regard to the alleged breaches in Downing Street and Whitehall was sufficient to reach our criteria to begin such an investigation. “Our investigation was thorough and impartial and was completed as quickly as we could, given the amount of information that needed to be reviewed and the importance of ensuring that we had strong evidence for each FPN referral. “This investigation is now complete.”",News/UK news,Police conclude Partygate investigation into Downing Street gatherings,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/19/met-police-conclude-partygate-investigation-into-downing-street-gatherings
5/19/2022,"The supreme court is set to overturn Roe v Wade, this much has been clear since a draft opinion authored by Justice Samuel Alito was leaked earlier this month. An attempt to safeguard abortion rights via national legislation was blocked by a united front of Republicans plus Democrat Joe Manchin in the Senate last week. As a result, we must expect abortion to be banned in roughly half the country soon. It is very hard to overstate how significant this moment is. The US is about to join the very short list of countries that have restricted existing abortion rights since the 1990s – the overall trend internationally certainly has been towards a liberalization of abortion laws. And it’s also a basically unique development in US history: while the supreme court has often upheld and codified a discriminatory status quo, it has never actively and officially abolished what had previously been recognized as a constitutionally guaranteed right. The overturning of Roe v Wade and Planned Parenthood v Casey constitutes the culmination of half a century of conservative legal activism, and rejecting Roe has been a key element of conservative political identity for decades. But the impending end of Roe will still not magically appease the right. Attempts to institute a national ban are likely to follow. The people behind this anti-abortion rights crusade consider abortion murder and the epitome of everything that’s wrong and perverted about liberalism – they will tolerate the right to bodily autonomy in “blue” America for only as long as they absolutely have to. And the conservative vision for the country goes well beyond outlawing abortion. In his opinion, Justice Samuel Alito rejects the legal underpinnings of many of the post-1960s civil rights extensions that were predicated on a specific interpretation of the 14th amendment. He targets the very idea of a right to privacy, employs an extremely narrow view of “substantive due process” and claims that the 14th amendment protects only those rights not explicitly listed in the constitution that are “deeply rooted in this nation’s history and tradition”. Alito applies an arbitrary standard – one that birth control, marriage equality and even desegregation clearly don’t meet. The fact that he adds a throwaway paragraph claiming that these rights, all based on the very understanding of the 14th amendment Alito so explicitly rejects, are not in danger, shouldn’t put anyone at ease. Alito’s opinion precisely captures the essence of the supreme court’s role through most of history, and certainly today: an institution siding with tradition over change, with existing power structures over attempts to level hierarchies, with the old over the new. That’s the spirit the “deeply rooted in history and tradition” standard seeks to enshrine as dogma: established hierarchies are to be revered and protected, anything that threatens them is illegitimate. It’s a dogma that is utterly incompatible with the idea of a fully functioning multiracial, pluralistic democracy in which the individual’s political, social and economic status is not significantly determined by race, gender, religion, or sexual orientation. For conservatives, that’s exactly the point, and it is how Alito’s opinion fits into the broader assault on the post-1960s civil rights order: it’s all part of a multi-level reactionary counter-mobilization against multiracial pluralism. It is only in this context that the whole weight of what this supreme court is doing is revealed. The conservative majority on the court operates as an integral part of a reactionary political project. Alito’s opinion should be a stark reminder of what that project is all about – and why the end of Roe is very likely to be just the beginning of a large-scale reversal that seeks to turn the clock back significantly. Conservatives could not be clearer about what their goal is: their animating vision for America is 1950s-style white Christian patriarchal dominance. The evidence is in what Republicans have been pursuing on the state level. We are seeing a wave of red-state legislation rolling back basic rights and fundamental liberties, intended to eviscerate the civil rights regime that has been established since the 1960s – and banish, outlaw and censor anything that threatens white Christian male dominance. The reactionary counter-mobilization is happening on so many fronts simultaneously that it’s easy to lose sight of how things are connected. Ban abortion and contraception, criminalize LGBTQ+ people; install strict guidelines for education that are in line with a white nationalist understanding of the past and the present, censor dissent; restrict voting rights, purge election commissions. These are not disparate actions. The overriding concern behind all of them is to maintain traditional political, social, cultural, and economic hierarchies. It’s a vision that serves, first and foremost, a wealthy white elite – and all those who cling to white Christian patriarchal dominance. It’s a political project that goes well beyond Congress and state legislatures: this is about restoring and entrenching traditional authority in the local community, in the public square, in the workplace, in the family. In all these areas, the assault on democracy and the civil rights order is escalating. Longstanding anti-democratic tendencies notwithstanding, the right has been radicalizing significantly in recent years. Why now? The more structural answer is that America has changed, and the conservative political project has come under enormous pressure as a result. The Republican hold on power has become tenuous, certainly on the federal level, and even in some states that had previously been solidly “red”. The right is reacting to something real: the political, cultural and most importantly demographic changes that have made the country less white, less conservative, less Christian are not just figments of the reactionary imagination. And recent political and societal events have dramatically heightened the sense of threat on the right. The first one was the election and re-election of the first Black president to the White House. Regardless of his moderately liberal politics, Obama’s “radicalism” consisted of being Black, a symbol of the imminent threat to the “natural” order of white dominance. The right’s radicalization must also be conceptualized as a white reactionary counter-mobilization specifically to the anti-racist mobilization of civil society after the murder of George Floyd. In the Black Lives Matter-led protests of 2020 that – at least temporarily – were supported by most white liberals, the right saw irrefutable proof that radically “un-American” forces of “woke”, leftist extremism were on the rise, hellbent on destroying “real” America. The American right is fully committed to this anti-democratic, anti-pluralistic vision – which they understand is a minoritarian project. Abortion bans, for instance, are not popular at all. About two-thirds of the population want to keep Roe and believe abortion should be legal at least in some cases; a clear majority supports a law legalizing abortion nationally. Meanwhile, a complete ban – a position many Republican-led states are taking – is favored by less than 10% of Americans. Conservatives are acutely aware that they don’t have numerical majorities for their project. But they don’t care about democratic legitimacy. And the Republican party has a comprehensive strategy to put this reactionary vision into practice anyway. In Washington, Republican lawmakers are mainly focused on obstructing efforts to safeguard democracy. It’s at the state level where the rightwing assault is accelerating the most. It all starts with not letting too many of the “wrong” people vote. That’s why Republican lawmakers are introducing hundreds of bills intended to make voting more difficult, and have enacted such laws almost everywhere they are in charge. All of these voter suppression laws are ostensibly race-neutral and non-partisan. But they are designed to have a disproportionate effect on voters of color, or on young people – on groups that tend to vote Democratic. If too many of the “wrong” people are still voting, Republicans want to make their electoral choices count less. Gerrymandering is one way they are trying to achieve that goal, and it has been radicalizing basically wherever the GOP is in charge. As that might still not be enough to keep the “wrong” people from winning, Republicans are trying to put themselves in a position to nullify their future wins: we are seeing election subversion efforts up and down the country – an all-out assault on state election systems. Republican-led state legislatures are re-writing the rules so that they will have more influence on future elections, election commissions are being purged, local officials are being harassed, people who are a threat to Republican rule are replaced by Trumpist loyalists. In many key states, Trumpists who aggressively subscribe to the big lie that the 2020 was stolen are currently running for high office. Republicans understand that such blatant undermining of democracy might lead to a mobilization of civil society. That’s why they are criminalizing protests, by defining them as “riots”, and by legally sanctioning physical attacks on “rioters”. The right also encourages white militants to use whatever force they please to suppress these “leftwing” protests by celebrating and glorifying those who have engaged in such violent fantasies – call it the Kyle Rittenhouse approach. Finally, Republicans are flanking all this by a broad-scale offensive against everything and everyone criticizing the legitimacy of white nationalist rule – past, present and future – by censoring and banning critical dissent inside and outside the education sector. Ideally, the supreme court would step in and put a stop to the escalating attempts to undermine democracy and roll back civil rights. But the conservative majority on the court is actually doing the opposite, providing robust cover for the reactionary counter-mobilization. This has established an enormously effective mechanism of how to turn the clock back to the pre-civil rights era: Republican-led states will abolish established protections and count on the supreme court to let them do as they please, even if it means overthrowing precedent. That puts the onus on Congress to enact nationwide legislation that would guarantee civil rights and protect democracy – legislation that has little chance to overcome Republican (plus Sinema/Manchin) obstruction. And so we keep spiraling further and further back, with the next round of state-level reactionary legislation always guaranteed to be right around the corner. The exact same dynamic has undermined voting rights across “red” states. This is how civil rights perish and democracy dies. Even now that the conservatives on the supreme court are about to end the right to abortion, I know such a statement strikes many people as extreme, or at the very least as alarmist. They won’t go that far, will they? But by portraying their opponent as a fundamentally illegitimate faction that seeks to destroy the country, conservatives have been giving themselves permission to embrace whatever radical measures they deem necessary to defeat this “un-American” enemy. We are in deeply dangerous territory precisely because so many on the right have convinced themselves they are fighting a noble war against unpatriotic, godless forces that are in league with pedophiles – and therefore see no lines they are not justified to cross. The white reactionary counter-mobilization against multiracial, pluralistic democracy won’t stop because the people behind it have some sort of epiphany that they shouldn’t go that far. It will either be stopped or succeed in entrenching white Christian patriarchal rule.

5/19/2022,"When artistic director Benoit Swan Pouffer arrived at Rambert in 2018, he wanted to create a company of unique dancers you couldn’t take your eyes off. On current evidence, he has succeeded. These performers are diverse in bodies and backgrounds, and each has their own wow factor. Like Aishwarya Raut, in one work so jarringly android-like you can just about see the zeroes and ones racing through her operating system; or the protean Jonathan Wade, a whirlwind of astonishing speed; or Musa Motha, an amputee who, with one leg and one crutch takes flight in a corkscrewing blur. There are no duds in this triple bill, each work demanding something very different. Dutch brother and sister Imre and Marne van Opstal choreograph Eye Candy, an unsettling meditation on the fetishisation of the perfect human body. The dancers play robotic non-humans, dressed in nude suits with silicone breasts and six-packs. Their physical control is incredible, the facility to freeze any muscle at any moment; with their futile attempts at connection, it’s a pretty dystopian vision. Their glitching AI movement couldn’t be more different from the long, liquid, organic phrases of Alonzo King’s Following the Subtle Current Upstream. It’s a rare chance to see San Francisco-based King’s work in the UK. His choreography – which looks like ballet that’s eaten up any other dance style that’s crossed its path – is technically exposing, and demands focus, flow and serene equilibrium. The effect is as hypnotic as watching ripples on water. Not only can this troupe seriously dance, but they can deliver a line too. Ben Duke’s Cerberus is a very clever, very meta piece of comic dance theatre. It starts like an anxiety dream, a stage technician suddenly finding himself on stage giving a eulogy to a dancer. “But she’s just in the dressing room!” he says. Named after the dog that guards the underworld, it skates deftly over the confusions of mortality and grief, and there are some vivid solos. Duke’s talent is to be light and deep at the same time, out-there but unpretentious, amusing and surprisingly moving. Live music from drummer Romarna Campbell and divine-voiced mezzo-soprano Rebecca Leggett is a bonus. Pouffer’s judgment is spot on. At Sadler’s Wells, London, until 21 May.

5/19/2022,"My partner, Frank Goodingham, who has died aged 85, was a carver and gilder who could turn his hand to almost any craft. Frank was born in East Ham, London, the son of Minnie (nee Hand), who had managed a grocer’s shop, and Bill Goodingham, a builder. During the second world war, Frank, his mother and his elder sister, Muriel, were evacuated to Dinton, near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. He never forgot seeing the docks in flames as they left. After he left Clark’s college, Ilford, in Essex, Frank’s first job was at a West End commercial art studio, Individual Artists. He rose from tea boy to figure artist before being called up for his national service in 1956 and posted to Libya. Frank later took a series of driving jobs, including at FA Pollak, the picture framers. There, he became fascinated with woodcarving and gilding, and wangled his way into the workshop to learn the crafts from practitioners who had arrived from Germany before the war. He worked for several London framing firms and art and antique dealers, and set up a workshop in the coal-hole outside his basement flat in North Gower Street. Frank was also a self-taught multi-instrumentalist. In the 1950s, he had played the trombone in a jazz band, which later became a rock group, the Brothers Grimm, with Frank on guitar. They released a single and toured with the Rolling Stones, with Frank as roadie. After a gig at the 100 Club in the West End, he met Sheenagh Williams, then a trainee teacher. They married in 1966, and had two sons, Ben and Tim, before divorcing in the 70s. Both sons followed in Frank’s footsteps as woodworkers, training as furniture designers, and trading as Goodingham Brothers in London. I met in Frank in the 70s, and we moved to rural Lincolnshire with my son, Oli. There, Frank made puppets and took up silversmithing. In the 80s, we moved to Cambridge, where Frank met Julie Crick, the picture restorer, and together they worked for antique dealers, museums and many colleges in Cambridge. Frank restored frames and furniture, and also produced original work. He made a pair of gilded wooden pier glasses for the Old Combination Room at Trinity College, as well as restoring some huge trophy frames. He later passed on his skills to some of the cabinetmakers at Trinity. Frank also took up photography, setting up his own darkroom, taking closeups of flowers and insects, photos of Fenland waterways, and studies of decaying willow trees. He retired officially on his 80th birthday, but returned to drawing, took up the ukulele, and was still taking pictures on his iPad weeks before he died. His work, though anonymous, hangs in the Courtauld Gallery, the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, the National Horseracing Museum in Newmarket and the National Portrait Gallery.

5/19/2022,"At long last, peace. Expensive peace, certainly. But a peace without which US Soccer was never going to progress. The slogan US Soccer has tried to push for many years is “One Nation, One Team”. That’s difficult to take to heart when women’s team advocates openly mock the men’s lack of World Cup success and men’s team advocates fire back with constant reminders that the women lose to men’s youth teams. With the new collective bargaining agreements announced Wednesday by US Soccer and the players’ unions, everyone is finally on the same side. Almost. The men’s and women’s teams now have equity across the board in every apples-to-apples comparison and even a few that are closer to apples-to-pears – beating the 24th-ranked men’s team on the road is much tougher than getting a home win over the 24th-ranked team in the shallower pool of women’s soccer national teams, but they will now have identical win bonuses. That’s low-hanging fruit that could’ve and should’ve been resolved years ago. Those comparisons are easier today because the women have finally given up guaranteed salaries that provided stability when women’s pro soccer was virtually non-existent but became a legal albatross because the women negotiated for a deal with a different structure – not just different pay amounts – than the bonus-only deal the men had. More importantly, each team now directly benefits from each other’s success. Prize money and commercial revenue will be pooled together and split between the two teams. An MNT win in the World Cup round of 16 means more money for the WNT. A WNT World Cup triumph means more money for the MNT. Win-win in the most literal sense. “We’ll be each other’s biggest cheerleaders, for sure,” said Walker Zimmerman, a US men’s defender and a leader within the team’s players’ association, on a media conference call. For example – in the 2022 and 2023 World Cup, the player pool will receive 90% of any prize money their teams win. Yes – 90%, with a nine and a zero. And that might anger some of the grassroots soccer people who already think too much money is going to players’ beach houses rather than youth, coaching and referee development programs, a belief so fervent that they almost returned Carlos Cordeiro to the presidency two months ago, a mere two years after his tenure of public embarrassment and organizational calamity ended with his resignation. For sake of comparison, Norway’s much-hyped “equal pay” deal, which does not pool and share prize money, pays each team 25% of the prize money they win in major tournaments, which means the dollar amount paid to men for a similar result to the women is exponentially higher. Australia’s deal, which also isn’t “equal” in a sense that would’ve satisfied the US women or their battalion of lawyers, pays on a sliding scale up to 50% but also sets aside 5% of “player-generated revenue” for youth national teams. But the US teams’ big paychecks aren’t new. Under the previous US deals, the women received roughly 100% of the prize money for winning the World Cup, some of it paid as a “Victory Tour” bonus on top of their game fees for Victory Tour games. The men’s percentage is more difficult to calculate because it includes bonuses for each group-stage point, but a deep run in the World Cup would put the men’s share somewhere in the 60-70% range or a little higher. The prize money also drops to 80% in the next cycle, which could still be a nice payout if Fifa continues to raise, ever so slowly, prize money for the increasingly successful Women’s World Cup. And payment across the board isn’t exponentially higher than what was in past deals – for example, a friendly win over a highly ranked opponent will net each player $18,000, up just slightly from the $17,625 in the last men’s deal and the $12,750 for women who weren’t already salaried. So if these deals aren’t budget-busters, will that be enough to mollify the grassroots organizers? To recap: Cordeiro resigned when a legal brief came to light that was astonishingly insulting to the accomplished women’s team. But state associations and other federation members convinced him to run in an effort to overthrow Cindy Cone, the Hall of Fame player who had assumed the presidency when Cordeiro was pushed out. Despite warnings from sponsors and fans that restoring Cordeiro to the throne would cause considerable damage, the former president drew 47.1% of the weighted vote. Had the Athletes’ Council not recently had its share raised from 20% to 33.3% by federal law, Cone likely would not have been basking in the good news on Wednesday. On the eve of the election, US Soccer announced a $24m settlement with the women’s team. The cynical take was that the announcement timing was politically motivated to help Cone, especially because the deal was still contingent on CBA negotiations that wound up taking two more months. But that deal might have actually hurt Cone because, in the minds of many members, that was $24m that would not go to other programs – youth national teams, grassroots grants, coaching education, referee development and other national teams. To give one example: US Soccer boasts strong teams in seven-a-side soccer for players with cerebral palsy and traumatic brain injury, a discipline that used to be in the Paralympics and might one day return, and the US women just won the inaugural world championship. And the federation isn’t swimming in money, Scrooge McDuck-style, any more. US Soccer is running eight-figure deficits these days, slicing into a once-mighty pile of assets. But the budget will look a lot better without quite so many legal bills. The federation no longer has to do damage control over PR missteps such as the one that cost Cordeiro his presidency or the “equal pay” fight in general, which was largely misunderstood by everyone from lawmakers to pundits. Cone is optimistic that the settlement of such a long labor process – the men have been playing under an expired CBA since 2018, and the women sued the federation in 2019 – will lift the federation’s many boats, competitively and commercially. “Yes, this is a lot of money, but I think it’s a real positive that will help us grow the pie,” Cone said on the media call. Pay equity is never going to be exact. Under these deals, the women will surely make much more money than the men, no matter where they finish in the next World Cups. They get prize money for the Olympics; the men do not. The women’s schedule, typically focused more on crowd-pleasing home friendlies than character-building European friendlies or difficult Central American qualifying games, is easier than the men’s, which will mean they’ll rack up more win bonuses. But it’s hard to argue that disparity merits a complaint. The men will still, by all accounts, get paid quite well in comparison with their peers. And with their club teams, many of them get seven-figure salaries while the women are still struggling to get six figures. “We knew there was a chance of making less money,” Zimmerman said. “But we believe so much in the women’s team and the premise of equal pay, and ultimately, that was a big driving force for us.” This isn’t the last step forward for US Soccer. But it’s a big one.",Sport/Football,US Soccer’s historic equal pay deal represents a hard-won peace,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/19/uswnt-collective-bargaining-equal-pay

It was a rare bright moment in the story of what happened to the members of the Band who weren’t Robbie Robertson in the years following the quintet’s split, a grim saga involving bitter enmity, addiction, suicide, bankruptcy and jail.

But perhaps no performer was quite as appropriate to the event as Mavis Staples, who played a Midnight Ramble with Helm and his band in 2011. Helm had prosaic reasons for starting the shows – after suffering with throat cancer which left him unable to sing for five years, he had medical bills to pay – but his stated aim was to recreate the atmosphere of the travelling tent shows he’d seen as a child in Arkansas. The “midnight ramble”, he explained, was a second, adults-only performance, “where the songs would get a little bit juicier, the jokes would get funnier and the prettiest dancer would really get down and shake it”. It isn’t a stretch to imagine the songs that form the backbone of Staples and Helm’s live set as part of a travelling show’s 1940s repertoire – albeit in the less risque part of the evening – sung by someone who sounded not unlike Mavis Staples: a big, arresting, church-reared voice with a gritty undertow. Certainly, the bluesy gospel standards Hand Writing on the Wall, You Got to Move and This May Be the Last Time (subsequently secularised, the latter two found their way into the Rolling Stones’ ouevre) and the a cappella hymn Farther Along are all old enough to have featured. Two songs from Helm’s solo canon, When I Go Away and Wide River to Cross, feel so rooted in pre-rock’n’roll traditions that they could be decades older than they are. Augmented with a horn section, Helm’s band cooks and Staples sounds commanding: the sense that everyone on stage is having a high old time seeps through the speakers. Indeed, Staples is commanding enough to transform Bob Dylan’s Gotta Serve Somebody (“It may be the devil or it may be the lord”), a song that so incensed John Lennon he recorded a scabrous, scouse-accented response: “Yer gotta serve yerself / That’s right, la, get that straight in yer fuckin’ ’ead”. Lennon evidently thought the song was didactic and pious, but he might have changed his tune if he’d heard Staples sing it. She supplants Dylan’s nasal sneer with a vocal that slowly builds from understated and foreboding, to a series of cathartic, guttural snarls. Also transformed is This Is My Country, one of Curtis Mayfield’s most intriguing protest songs. The original flips from fury in its depictions of slavery and lives lost in the civil rights struggle, to addressing white listeners with a cordial plea for reason, at odds with 1968’s militant mood: “I know you will give consideration / Shall we perish unjust or live together as a nation?” In the second year of the Obama presidency, with ominous storm clouds already gathering on the right, Helm and Staples adjust the song’s mood accordingly. Helm’s playing emphasises drum rolls, lending the rhythm a more militaristic feel than the Impressions’ laid-back original. Staples extemporises on the lyrics, so the end of the song suggests someone’s patience finally snapping: “You got some folk throwing a party but nobody invited me / They’re mixing up the Kool-Aid and passing it off as tea / I hear a lot of people saying they want to take their country back / Don’t sound like progress to me.” The album ends with The Weight, a song the Staple Singers covered in 1968 and performed with the Band in Martin Scorsese’s film The Last Waltz. There’s a compelling argument that it’s the film’s highlight, although devotees of the extraordinary moment where Van Morrison, crammed into a hideous sequined outfit, starts high-kicking his way across the stage – looking, as one film critic memorably put it, like a “homicidal elf” – may beg to differ. In that version, Helm sings the song’s first verse, before Staples takes over. Here, the roles are reversed, so Staples’ gutsy vocal acts as a prelude for Helm’s appearance. Ravaged by illness, his voice is husky and battered, yet perfectly in tune – it has a careworn, down-but-not-out quality. He changes the personal pronouns in one line, so it seems to be referring to his own travails – “I’m gonna do myself a favour, stick around” – and toward the song’s end, lets out a defiant, crackling roar. That Helm had less than a year to live obviously lends his performance poignancy, but as epitaphs go, Carry Me Home isn’t really one suffused with what-might-have-been melancholy: it’s too exuberant, too vibrant for that. It sounds more like a man going out in a blaze of glory.

5/19/2022,"The Hamsun Centre in Hamarøy, northern Norway (a couple of hours by boat from Bodø), is dedicated to Norway’s most famous novelist, Knut Hamsun (1859-1952), hailed by many as the father of modern Norwegian literature. Designed by the American architect Steven Holl, the striking building, which dominates the landscape for miles, offers references to the man and his work, including “hair” on its head (the roof), a metallic “spine” running through the building and a beckoning hand (a yellow balcony jutting out from the dark facade).M Peyre Sala Santa Cecilia looks like a giant silver beetle or, possibly, a computer mouse. It’s one of three metallic-roofed “pods”, each with specific acoustic features, which are part of the vast complex making up Parco della Musica Auditorium. Designed by Renzo Piano, and finished in 2002, it stands on the site of the 1960 Olympic Park on the outskirts of Rome. Though the pods are definitely modernist, the 2,700-capacity outdoor theatre is a clear nod to ancient Rome, as is the use of Travertine marble throughout. We enjoyed the timeless experience of listening to music in the balmy Italian evening air.Sherry The tiny village of Wrabness in north Essex hosts Grayson Perry’s A House for Essex. Five years in the making, it was designed as a shrine to the fictional character Julie Cope. This folly is the gingerbread house out of the Hansel and Gretel fairytale. The building, clad in colourful relief tiles with a bright gold roof, has been compared to a Scandinavian stave church or a Russian chapel. Set in a tranquil landscape with views over green fields to the Stour estuary, it is a must if you ever find yourself in “England’s most misunderstood country”.Alison Barker Take a tour of common areas and a typical apartment at Le Corbusier’s Unité d’Habitation in Marseille, France.

It is a great modern structure for kids to enjoy. It is in fact a playground based on Giant Gulliver. He is lying on the ground and the different parts of him form stairs and slides for the children to play on! Entrance is free but do check the opening hours as they can vary. The park is in the east part of the Túria Gardens, close to the City of Arts and Sciences, another fine modern structure in Valencia.Sue O’Brien Cross from Asia to Europe in just 13 minutes: that’s how long it will take you to traverse the brand-new 1915 Çanakkale Bridge, straddling the Dardanelles strait, 40 miles north-east of the ancient city of Troy, across to the Gallipoli peninsula on the north side, a little way west of Istanbul. The bridge, which boasts the longest suspension span in the world, is a beautiful structure in its own right – like a sleek 21st-century version of San Francisco’s Golden Gate. The main attraction here, though, has to be the incredible views along the Dardanelles towards the Sea of Marmara to one side and the open Mediterranean to the other.Jayne Pearson I staggered off the night train from Venice recently in Graz, Austria, and decided to go for an early-morning walk around the old town.

It was built in the early 1990s – I think that qualifies as modern in architecture! It’s so unusual because it sticks out from the gothic/baroque architecture that Prague is known for. It’s right on the river in the New Town district. When I saw it for the first time, it really gave the impression that it was falling into itself, sort of like when a fantasy/sci-fi movie visualises a black hole orwormhole, where everything becomes distorted and hard structures appear liquid.

5/19/2022,"It’s the 1980s and 12-year-old Ayosa Ataraxis Brown lives in the fictional town of Mapeli, in the hills and forests of Kenya’s Rift valley. She declares herself “the loneliest girl in the world”, with only a transistor radio and the daily broadcasts of a poet named Ms Temperance to link her with the wider world. Her metaphysical companions are the Fatumas who haunt her house, “creatures of the attic, half girl and half reverie”, pulled from the Indian Ocean by a fisherman 400 years ago. When her mother could not deal with the young Ayosa, she would leave her to the Fatumas, to soothe her crying and sing her to sleep. Although the house shakes with their grievous wailing when death notices are broadcast on the radio, no one else can see them; they “let all their parts slacken”, melting their human forms into the “jagged spokes” and “sticky, bitter gel” of an aloe plant in a seagrass pannier to conceal themselves from outsiders’ eyes. Unlike the wraiths who try to lure Ayosa away from her home, the Fatumas seem to safeguard the vulnerable, courageous woman Ayosa is growing into. And yet they are trapped in the attic, just as Ayosa is trapped in her childhood dependence on her mother, on the verge of awakening a more powerful part of herself and dreaming of being free. The irony of Ayosa’s middle name is the key to Caine prize winner Okwiri Oduor’s magical, beguiling debut novel. Things They Lost tells the tales of four generations of formidable women, who have lives “nestled inside each other like Babushka dolls” – it was Lola Freedom, Ayosa’s flying-doctor grandmother, whose actions trapped them all in a cycle of violence. Ataraxis means serenity, but Ayosa’s peace is shaken by a tornado of emotions and hideous memories. Her mother’s middle name is Promise, but her promises are regularly broken. Torn between desires for independence and attention from a mother who “came and went like Blackjack needles blowing where the breeze decided”, Ayosa seeks the serenity she needs in nature: aphids, katydids, lacewings, nectar dripping from “the orange tubes of lion’s ear flowers”. The narrative voice is highly attuned to the sensuous shapes and textures of the natural riches surrounding Ayosa’s childhood home. Nabumbo Promise Brown is described by her daughter as loving “fiercely … She laughed effusively, but then, somewhere in the shade of herself, icicles tapered from above, waiting to decapitate you.” Their home is inherited from Ayosa’s great-grandmother, the eccentric English widow Mabel Eudoxia Brown, who wielded a musket that “she fired at the backs of fleeing children”. Like the house at the centre of Isabel Allende’s The House of the Spirits, the “Manor Mabel Brown” is a colonial artefact, “lurid and vulgar”, populated by “weary shadows”. At the heart of the novel is the magnetic power of “want” – that life force that makes Ayosa’s “toes curl”, whether she’s thinking of the restless river, the clamorous insects and ravenous jackals, or the possibility of having a friend such as Mbui Dash, “a throwaway girl”, who might make her feel wanted – feel like a real sister, mother or daughter. Ayosa has powers beyond mere daydreaming. She is able to access “the Yonder Days”, memories from her mother’s and grandmother’s past, a time when she was just a wiggling thing, without corporeal form, before her mother called her into being. This seer-like gift means Ayosa can also be summoned into “Jinamezi”, the Kiswahili word for nightmare, forcing her to see unbearable things and revisit painful memories. These are the titular “things they lost” – often examples of silences kept since the “disappearances” of the 1978-2002 Moi era, when the government was responsible for numerous human rights violations, including massacres, unlawful detentions, rape and torture. Delineating a matrilineal rather than patrilineal history, Ayosa gathers her most important thoughts into a notebook that balances the sins and duties of Catholicism with the wildness, pleasure and creativity of the Earth Mother. When questioned about what she is writing, Ayosa replies simply, “what it’s like for a girl like me”. Things They Lost carries echoes of Toni Morrison’s Beloved, while Oduor shares Yvonne Adhiambo Owuor’s gift for illustrating the complexity of rural inland and coastal Kenyan reality, with its intricacy of connections to Uganda, Tanzania and the Swahili coast. Her ability to tap into a depth and range of feeling, while accessing unexpected humour, is uncanny. Throughout the novel, Oduor skilfully balances whimsy with satirical, devastating realism, a trait she nails as particularly Kenyan. “If anything that was the problem with Kenyans. They did not know how to hold back with the truth. They brutalised you with the truth.” The result is a surreal novel that is beautifully written, compelling, ominous and mysterious, with a strong, young, female Kenyan voice at the centre.

5/19/2022,"It is twilight in Las Horquetas valley in Patagonia’s northern Aysén region. Several cars have pulled over beneath sandy cliffs on a wide paved road. Just metres away, three deer graze unperturbed in the glow of the car lights. The Patagonian huemul (Hippocamelus bisulcus), or South Andean deer, is the most endangered hoofed animal in South America. It has deep inset eyes, furry antlers and is no bigger than a toddler. Fewer than 1,500 survive today – two-thirds are found in Chile and the remainder in Argentina, where the huemul’s principal habitat is lenga forest and scrubland. They exist in severely fragmented groups of 101 known sub-populations, with 60% of these comprising only 10-20 individuals, making them susceptible to freak weather events. They also suffer from poor genetic diversity. The huemul was first brought to the attention of the wider public in Chile in 1834, when the British painter Charles C Wood Taylor convinced the government that a creature from the largely unexplored Patagonian territory should accompany the condor in his design for the country’s coat of arms. The huemul, “an almost unknown animal”, was chosen. It has been officially protected since 2006, when it was given Chilean natural monument status, and in 2010 Chile and Argentina agreed to jointly conserve the deer. Today, conservation efforts in Chile are being stepped up. Gustavo Saldivia, founder of the Aumen Foundation, which has been protecting huemul on an 8,500-hectare (32 sq mile) area of public land near Tortel in Chile since 2001, thinks he knows why. “It flutters its eyelashes. It’s sexy,” he says. The organisation Rewilding Chile is also working to protect huemul by buying areas of wilderness and private grazing land in Patagonia for restoration and conservation projects. In 2018, it gave 400,000 hectares of rewilded land to the country, collaborating with the government to create a Route of Parks, which today connects a patchwork of 17 national parks, extending 1,700 miles over the southern third of Chile. The Route of Parks has increased connections between disparate huemul sub-populations but ranching, hunting and construction on private land between these parks still pose a threat to the huemul. To address this, Rewilding Chile has created a huemul national corridor. “The Route of Parks is the spine,” says Rewilding Chile’s wildlife director, Cristián Saucedo, “and now the huemul corridor forms the ribcage.” Restoring the interconnectivity of huemul populations along the length of Patagonia is the ultimate goal, says Saucedo, but first their numbers must be bolstered and threats reduced in the areas they currently occupy. Since 2020, Saucedo has overseen the purchase of 670 hectares of private land and subsequent livestock fence removal in Las Horquetas valley, connecting it to the 180,000-hectare Cerro Castillo national park to create a key part of the huemul corridor. “These small contributions of land are very important because, even though they are small, they are key places to protect and connect these [huemul] ‘islands’,” says Rody Álvarez, a Rewilding Chile warden. Kristine Tompkins, co-founder of Tompkins Conservation, which launched Rewilding Chile in 2021, says: “Respecting wildlife means undoing the damage we’ve done. One way of doing that is by restoring corridors for crucial species, like the huemul, whose time is running out.” In a study earlier this year, the huemul was named as one of 20 key terrestrial species whose reintroduction could positively affect biodiversity. The lead researcher, Carly Vynne, says: “A focused effort on recovering this species would not only help the species itself but could also help complete assemblages across vast areas [of Patagonia].” Reconnecting the Patagonian pockets the huemul has been reduced to could help restore the depleted in-between landscapes, the study said. The huemul is the only large mammal missing from many Patagonian ecosystems. Saucedo describes huemul as a “sentinel species”, providing intelligence on how a damaged ecosystem is recovering. But the huemul continues to face threats, including the climate crisis and a change of land use. It has already been reduced to less than 50% of its original habitat, according to a 2018 research paper, and a further 60% reduction is expected by 2050, largely due to the impact of warmer winters. “In the last 15 years, the region has been fragmenting very quickly,” says Álvarez. “Landscapes are being divided into lots.” The owners of these properties often break up huemul habitat by putting up fences, often made of barbed wire. Concerted efforts to preserve the huemul mean that numbers are gradually increasing at Las Horquetas but the species is still in decline, according to the IUCN Red List. Wide-ranging conversations, says Saucedo, are needed between both public and private sectors, and with Argentina, where huemul populations straddle the border, if the huemul is to be saved. “To rewild huemul, you require cooperation with a long-term perspective and finally the benefits are for the whole of humanity,” says Saucedo.

5/19/2022," My brother, the environmentalist Alexander Peckham, who has died aged 59, co-founded the Centre for Environment and Business in Scotland in 1989 and then went on to establish New Zealand’s largest cider orchard and leading independent cidery. Alex was born in Cambridge, to Catherine (nee King), a paediatric epidemiologist, and Michael Peckham, an artist and oncologist. When our family moved to Paris with my father’s work, Alex was sent to the local school, an immersion that led to a fluency in French and to a lifelong passion for French culture. Back in London, he attended the French Lycée and Westminster school. At over 6 ft 3 in, he was a star oarsman and became head of Westminster’s rowing club. He then studied geology at the University of Edinburgh, and went on to obtain an MSC in hydrogeology at the University of Birmingham. Alex’s maternal grandfather, the scientist and environmentalist Alexander King, was an important influence on his life. In 1968, King had co-founded the environmental think-tank the Club of Rome, which commissioned the bestselling report Limits to Growth from a team of researchers at MIT. Encouraged by his grandfather, and in partnership with his wife, Anne-Caroline (nee Filer), whom he had married in 1987, Alex set up the Centre for Environment and Business in Edinburgh, an organisation that would help businesses understand and fulfil their obligations under the new Environmental Protection Act of 1990. In 1992, this evolved into the Institute of Environmental Management, which worked closely with UK government to establish professional NVQ standards for environmental management. Some years later, the institute merged with the Institute of Environmental Assessment to create a new professional body that continues to thrive. An early advocate of sustainability, Alex authored several educational books on environmental issues, including Global Warming (1991). In 1999, Alex and Caroline moved to Fiunary on the Morvern peninsula and built a prototype passive house on the grounds of an estate overlooking the Sound of Mull, where they homeschooled their three children. Four years later, the family moved to New Zealand and went on to found Peckham’s Cidery and Orchard in Upper Moutere, close to Nelson at the top of the South Island, where they fused their environmental concerns and technical expertise with a passion for the outdoors. In contrast to the ciders produced by large-scale industrial cideries, which use unripe, rejected fruit, or concentrate, Peckham’s uses pure juice from quality heritage fruit, which took months to track down through word of mouth and old maps of abandoned orchards. Production is overseen on the estate, from milling and pressing to fermenting and bottling. Their award-winning cider has done much to promote New Zealand’s reputation as a region of world-class craft ciders to rival its better-known wines. Alex was a person of immense charisma and vision who shied away from the glare of publicity, preferring the solitude of the open sea and mountains, or working on the orchard. A keen sailor, he was about to embark on a sailing expedition when he collapsed and was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour. He is survived by Caroline and their children, Lydia, Oliver and Scarlett, and by his mother, Catherine, and two siblings, Daniel and me.",Lifestyle/Food,Alexander Peckham obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/may/19/alexander-peckham-obituary
5/19/2022,"My father, Roger Sales, who has died after a short illness, aged 72, was a pioneer in the field of interdisciplinary studies that prospered in the new universities of the 1960s, not least at the University of East Anglia (UEA) in Norwich, where he took his BA degree, and later returned to teach for 27 years. A scholar equally of English literature and of history, he delighted in bringing the two together in writing and teaching, and became UEA’s first professor of English studies. Born in Chesterfield, one of three children of Katharine (nee Adams), a teacher, and William Sales, who worked for the National Coal Board, Roger attended Bradfield college, in Berkshire, following his uncle Richard Adams, author of Watership Down. At UEA he took a first in history, incorporating liberal elements, already, of literature and philosophy; it was a logical step from there to target as his PhD supervisor, at Cambridge, the great interdisciplinary scholar Raymond Williams. This alliance led in 1975 to a very solid thesis on The Literature of Labour and the Condition of England Question 1730-1860. After short-term teaching jobs, Roger applied successfully for a post that was the Holy Grail of many arts graduates at the time: that of research assistant at the BBC. In this role, he worked on the production of the 1979 series Shakespeare in Perspective, which would lead to his first publication, a book of that name, in 1982. But the academic life always drew him back. In 1978 he returned to UEA, the first person appointed to teach English studies, as distinct from English literature, or English history. He is remembered there as an inspirational teacher, enthusiastic, committed to clarity as well as to vision, always supportive of his students and of their own career ambitions. In due course Roger became dean of the School of English and American Studies. His own publications were on subjects that ranged from Christopher Marlowe through Jane Austen and John Clare to Tom Stoppard. After retirement in 2005 from UEA, Roger kept up his interest in, especially, Clare, and he was a regular presence at the annual John Clare festival. His major scholarly legacy remains, arguably, his definitive book John Clare: A Literary Life (2002). Roger had a wicked sense of humour, was a mean tennis and squash player and a keen watcher of cricket and football: he followed Norwich City through good times and bad. Above all, he was a family man, devoted to his children and grandchildren. Roger is survived by his wife, Anne (nee Whitney), whom he married in 1975, by their two children, William and me, and by three grandchildren, Freddie, Indira and Leo.",News/Education,Roger Sales obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/19/roger-sales-obituary
5/19/2022,"My mother, Barbara van der Zee, who has died aged 88, was a journalist and author who wrote about fashion, history, plant medicine and nutrition. Despite many sadnesses in her life, including the death of her younger daughter from leukaemia in 1992, her lovely smile and enthusiasm for life and her family were a source of infectious happiness for everyone who knew her. She was born in Chipping Campden in the Cotswolds, the youngest of five children of the artist FL Griggs and his wife, Nina (nee Muir). After studying English literature at Birmingham University, Barbara began work at Vogue under Audrey Withers, moved on to the Express and the London Evening Standard, and then became fashion editor at the Daily Mail. In 1969, she met Henri van der Zee, at that time the London correspondent of the Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf, and they married the following year. I was born in 1972, and my sister, Ninka, in 1973, and they began to write history books together: William and Mary, about the extraordinary and yet little known events of 1688, was published in 1973, and A Sweet and Alien Land, the story of Dutch New York, in 1978. By 1980, after an exhausting decade, my mother decided to leave journalism and focus on books and the topics of nutrition and herbal medicine, which she found increasingly interesting. In 1981 she published Green Pharmacy, a history of herbal medicine, which explored the natural lineage of modern pharmacology, following this with The Home Herbal (1983), and The Food Factor (1987), a look at the history of nutrition in the 20th century. From 1990 onwards she also wrote the Superfoods books in partnership with her friend Michael van Straten. In 1992 Ninka died of leukaemia, aged 18. But despite this, my mother managed to find some happiness again. Work was always a source of tremendous comfort to her: for many years she was the health editor at Country Living, and in 2005 the National Institute of Medical Herbalists made her a lifetime honorary member, of which she was very proud. Despite separating from my father, who died in 2014, she always found her family a huge source of joy and laughter.

5/19/2022,"My friend Michael Henderson, who has died aged 90, was a Christian journalist and broadcaster, and the author of books on forgiveness in personal and public life. Michael was born in Ealing, west London, elder son of Douglas Henderson, a businessman, and his wife, Erina. In 1940, he and his younger brother, Gerald, were evacuated to live with a family in Boston, MA, during the second world war. As they left London, Michael called out to his mother: “See you after the duration.” He later wrote a book of this title, telling the stories of what happened to children evacuated to North America during the war. When the boys returned to Britain in 1945, it was hard for them to settle back into family life after five years away at such a formative time. To re-establish family unity, they visited the Caux centre near Montreux, Switzerland, run by the Moral Re-Armament movement, a Christian organisation. The centre had opened the previous year as a base for postwar reconciliation and trust-building. After leaving Mill Hill school, Michael volunteered at the Caux centre and continued to work for MRA internationally for the rest of his life. He and I met in the late 1960s, after I had left school, when we worked together on a newsletter called New World News, in London, published by MRA, of which he was the editor. In the early 1970s he was a correspondent for Himmat Newsweekly in Bombay (now Mumbai), India, and wrote the first of his 14 books here, From India With Hope (1972). Another book on India, Experiment with Untruth (1977), was an exposé of the emergency period of dictatorship imposed by the prime minister Indira Gandhi. Michael married Erica Hallowes in 1966. They went to the US in 1979 and lived for more than 20 years in Portland, Oregon, where Michael was a moderator on Oregon Public Broadcasting and made radio programmes.

5/19/2022,"This rich, beautiful and inexpressibly sad film is about the friendship between men who can’t talk about their feelings and about winning and losing at the great game of life. It is set in the breathtaking and wonderfully photographed Italian Alpine valley of Aosta, which includes the slopes of Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. But the “eight mountains” of the title refers to the eight highest peaks of Nepal: a mysterious symbol of worldly ambition and conquest. Belgian film-makers Felix van Groeningen and Charlotte Vandermeersch have adapted the award-winning 2016 novel by Italian author Paolo Cognetti and have created a deeply intelligent meditation on our capacity for love, and how it is shaped by the arbitrary, irreversible experiences of childhood, and by our relationship with the landscape. The Aosta valley is depicted with magnificent sweep, and van Groeningen and Vandermeersch find a stratum of sadness under it, a kind of water table of tears. We begin with the friendship of two 12-year-old boys, Pietro and Bruno, who get to know each other when Pietro’s mum and dad – to get away from the petrol fumes of Turin – come to the (fictional) village of Grana for the summer; Pietro befriends local lad Bruno, who is staying with his farmer uncle and aunt. They roam far afield in this magical place. But their Edenic friendship is ruined by Pietro’s parents, who make a heavy-handed and misjudged offer to let Bruno live with them in the big city and attend high school there. Bruno’s absent father objects to this condescension, and takes the boy away to work with him on a building site while Pietro starts a troubled middle-class student career. Pietro never forgives his father for splitting them up, and for being more impressed by the tougher and more alpha Bruno, who is a real outdoorsman. He never speaks to his father again. But fate reunites Bruno and Pietro as tough, bearded young men, played with subtlety and gentleness by Alessandro Borghi and Luca Marinelli. After a reticent, wary start Bruno suggests that, as neither have any work on, they spend an Alpine summer building a shack in the valley that will be their special place. It is not being too facetious to call this the straight Brokeback Mountain. In building this rudimentary stone hut, they have attempted to rebuild their childhood, rebuild their love for each other. But Pietro is to make a terribly painful discovery that, in his long and bitter absence, his wounded father actually became a friend to the grown-up Bruno, hiking with him in the valley and becoming a quasi-father to him. And, to add to the mortification of having his dad stolen from him by Bruno, Pietro finds that the young woman he is sort of interested in, is more interested in the unassuming Bruno. So poor Pietro leaves all over again, travelling in Nepal and becoming a celebrated writer, but consumed with the thought that his friendship with Bruno was the best of him – and Bruno was in some elemental sense the better man. This is a movie with air in its lungs and love in its heart. It is spacious and unhurried in its devotion to beauty and to what it means to be human. Bruno is a compelling character who becomes impassioned when talking about the mountains, and it is his tragedy that he ultimately prefers them to human beings. When some of Pietro’s Turin friends come to visit and one starts rhapsodising about “nature”, Bruno snaps contemptuously that “nature” is an abstract idea for city types: he prefers the solid realities of mountains, trees and rivers. This film has mystery and passion, it climbs mountainous heights and rewards you with the opposite of vertigo: a sort of exaltation.

Origi has been at Liverpool since 2015 and has scored some notable goals, including two against Barcelona during the famous Champions League semi-final comeback at Anfield in 2019 and the winner at home to Everton a year earlier. He has been unable to hold down a regular place, though, exemplified by starting two Premier League games over the past two seasons, and hopes to get more playing time at Milan.

5/19/2022,"The England and Sussex seamer Jofra Archer, whose injury troubles have kept him out of all forms of cricket since last July, has been ruled out for the rest of the English summer after suffering a stress fracture to his lower back. The 27-year-old becomes the third England seamer to be diagnosed with the same injury in the last week, following Lancashire’s Saqib Mahmood and Yorkshire’s Matt Fisher. Mark Wood, Olly Stone, Chris Woakes, Sam Curran and Ollie Robinson were also unavailable for selection for the first Test squad of the summer, announced on Wednesday, because of injury or illness. “It’s definitely a concern and trying to find out why this is happening is something we need to look into,” Rob Key, managing director of England men’s cricket, said on Wednesday. “We need to make sure that hopefully it never happens again but as you know with all fast bowlers these, unfortunately, are things that do happen, stress fractures in particular.” The news comes precisely a week before the start of Sussex’s Vitality Blast campaign, in which Archer was hoping to make his comeback from a long-term elbow injury. In a statement the England and Wales Cricket Board said that “no timeframe has been set for his return” and that “a management plan will be determined following further specialist opinion over the coming days”. It is over a year since Archer last played international cricket, a Twenty20 against India in Ahmedabad last March. He missed last year’s T20 World Cup and the Ashes because of his elbow injury, which was operated on last May and again in December. His latest setback has put his participation in this year’s T20 World Cup, which starts in Australia in October, in doubt. Archer admitted earlier this month that he had feared his career might be over during his long spell out of the game, but that he felt close to putting those troubles behind him. “From a fitness perspective, I cannot believe how good I feel,” Archer wrote in his Daily Mail column. “What I can say is that I’ve been building up nicely and bowling some really quick balls, so there’s no doubt I am not far away. “In a situation like this, when you are forced to have operations, you do think about whether you are going to play cricket again. It’s natural for anyone to worry about the future in that kind of situation. Suppose I had rushed my comeback, I might have messed things up more or injured something totally unrelated to what I had done previously and then I would be even further down the pecking order.”",Sport/Sport,Jofra Archer ruled out for season in latest England injury setback,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/19/jofra-archer-ruled-out-for-season-in-latest-england-injury-setback-cricket
5/19/2022,"Advocates for voluntary assisted dying say they will turn their attention to the federal government to strike down restrictions which prevent the ACT and Northern Territory from passing laws allowing euthanasia. The backlash comes as New South Wales became the last state to pass the laws. The historic voluntary assisted dying bill passed NSW parliament on Thursday after a months-long campaign. The bill has been hailed by advocates, including the comedian and journalist Andrew Denton, who founded an expert advisory and health promotion charity, Go Gentle, in the wake of his own father’s death. Denton said the legislation marked “a revolution in end-of-life care” and “evolution in our compassion as a society”, saying the push to legalise voluntary assisted dying had both started and ended in NSW, after a previous bill was defeated by one vote in 2017. “Having seen what the opposition here was like five years ago we realised the only way it was likely to pass was if every other state had done it, and that was our strategy and that’s how it turned out to be,” he said. After Victoria passed its laws in 2017, the other states followed. Queensland’s laws passed last year, making NSW became the final state to make voluntary assisted dying legal. “We could see we weren’t going to get it done [in NSW] and that’s why we put all our resources into Victoria, which was the first state and that set the ball rolling,” Denton said. Denton became invested in the campaign after he began researching the issue in the wake of his father’s death. He didn’t want to become “a celebrity voice” he said, and so spent a year travelling around Australia and overseas to learn more about the issue. “I saw terrible suffering in a medical system which either couldn’t help people or wouldn’t help people,” he said. Now Denton, like other advocates, said attention would turn to the federal government. The Northern Territory was the first jurisdiction in Australia to legalise assisted dying in 1995, but it was overruled by legislation passed by the Howard government in 1997. Since then, both territories have been barred from enacting voluntary assisted dying laws. After the bill passed in NSW, Scott Morrison, said he would not overturn the ban if the Coalition was elected. “There are differences between territories and states, and that is under constitution, and we are not proposing any changes to that,” Morrison said on Thursday. “That’s not our policy.” The NSW bill – which passed 20 years after it was first debated in parliament – passed after both major parties allowed MPs a conscience vote, despite the premier, Dominic Perrottet, and opposition leader, Chris Minns, both opposing it. While Labor has also not committed to any change to the law, Anthony Albanese said on Thursday that he was “a big supporter of conscience votes”. But, he said it would not be a priority if he was elected on Saturday. “No. I’ll set the priorities according to the priorities I’ve put out during the campaign, not according to a press conference two days beforehand,” he said. “My view is well known about territories and about the territories’ right to determine their own legislation. I’ve spoken about that in parliament and I’ve spoken about that in interviews.” The MP who spearheaded the legislation in NSW, Alex Greenwich, urged both leaders to “learn from Dominic Perrottet” in allowing MPs to exercise their conscience on the issue in the federal parliament. “Our focus must shift to federal parliament and it is incumbent on our colleagues in federal parliament to pass laws to allow the territories to be able to legislate for compassionate law reform,” he said. “We are passing the baton to our federal colleagues to ensure people in the territories have the same end of life choices as now every state in the country.”",News/Australia news,Assisted dying advocates shift focus to Australian government’s territory ban,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/19/assisted-dying-advocates-shift-focus-to-australian-governments-territory-ban
5/19/2022,"An exquisitely decorated silver casket believed to have played a role in the downfall of Mary, Queen of Scots has been acquired for the nation for £1.8m. The National Heritage Memorial Fund contributed £810,000 towards the cost of the casket, along with £200,000 from the Scottish government and donations from other organisations and individuals. Chris Breward, director of National Museums Scotland, said: “This extraordinary casket is truly one of Scotland’s national treasures. Venerated as a relic of Mary for centuries, it is believed to represent a momentous and disastrous moment in her turbulent life. “Beyond this, the magnificence of the piece speaks to a queen at the height of her powers, wealth and position.” The casket goes on display at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh from Thursday. It was made in Paris between 1493 and 1510, and is thought to have been given to Mary by her first husband, Francis II of France. A handwritten note dating from the late 17th century stored with the casket records the belief that it was produced at a hearing ordered by Elizabeth I against Mary at Westminster in December 1568. It contained what have become known as the Casket Letters: love poems and letters, allegedly from Mary to her third husband, the Earl of Bothwell, that implicated the pair in a conspiracy to murder her second husband, Lord Darnley. The letters are thought by many historians to have been doctored. Following the Westminster hearing, Mary remained in English captivity for 19 years, until she was executed in 1587 for her involvement in a plot to assassinate Elizabeth I and place Mary on the English throne. The casket was bought around 1674 by Anne, Duchess of Hamilton, and remained with the family for three centuries. Neil Gray, Scottish culture minister, said: “Quite apart from the colourful history associated with the item, given the belief that it belonged to Mary, Queen of Scots, the silver casket is a stunning work of art in its own right.” It was sold by Lennoxlove House in East Lothian, which said the sale would enable long-term maintenance of the house and its contents.",Arts/Culture,"Casket linked to Mary, Queen of Scots bought for nation for £1.8m",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/may/19/casket-linked-to-mary-queen-of-scots-bought-for-nation-scotland
5/19/2022,"A woman who was repeatedly sexually assaulted and harassed by a former Labour MP has been awarded nearly £435,000 by an employment tribunal in a ruling that could have major implications for outstanding claims against MPs. A central London employment tribunal on Wednesday ordered the former member for Hartlepool Mike Hill to pay £434,435 to Woman A. She was victimised after spurning Hill’s advances, an employment tribunal ruled in July. He was found to have climbed into the victim’s bed and sexually assaulted her in his parliamentary office. The case is the first public compensation payment ordered against an MP for sexual assault, and is expected to prompt other alleged victims in parliament to take action through the civil courts. It comes as Conservative officials come under increasing pressure to remove the whip from an MP arrested on Tuesday over claims of rape and sexual assault. Woman A told the Guardian that she hoped that Wednesday’s order would encourage other women to come forward and seek justice through the courts as an alternative to the parliamentary process. “It is important that the many women who have been sexually harassed and assaulted by MPs know that there is another way of seeking justice and compensation for their losses. “The parliamentary investigation route, which I went through, is arduous and very tough and conducted in private. “Pursuing Mike Hill through the courts has meant that I might receive compensation for my financial losses and the process seems much more open and transparent,” she said. Woman A said that the decision to take on Hill has nevertheless left her homeless, traumatised by PTSD, suffering from severe depressive disorder and with limited prospects of a career. “I have gone through two and a half years of hell. I left my job with nothing while he took his pension, and several months pay and was covered by £250,000 towards his legal fees. I had to crowdfund my case. The system, even through the courts, is weighted in favour of MPs,” she said. Woman A’s barrister welcomed the ruling and said she will now seek to enforce the order against Hill’s assets but may also sue the House of Commons if Hill is unable to pay. Suzanne McKie QC said: “We will now look to enforce against Mr Hill’s personal assets and take action against the House of Commons for the shortfall.” McKie told a remedy hearing in March that nearly all of the £250,000 insurance policy that the Commons had put in place to cover an MP facing an employment claim had been spent on Hill’s legal fees. She told the hearing that the Commons bore responsibility for failing to keep some money for her client’s legal costs and compensation. “Ms A now has to consider how to effect judgment against Mr Hill when there is almost nothing left in that pot of money, and whether to sue the House of Commons for failing to put in place a sufficiently protective policy,” McKie told the hearing. MPs are covered by a £5m insurance policy if they are sued for libel or slander, but by a £250,000 policy if an employee claims sexual harassment. Andrew Bridgen, the Conservative MP for North West Leicestershire who gave evidence on behalf of Woman A to the tribunal, said he will be raising the issue of MP’s insurance with Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, and Karen Bradley, the chair of the procedure committee, about the implications of the case for parliament. “The Ipsa insurance cover should be increased to at least £1m and there should be a limit set on the amount that can be spent on defence lawyers’ fees to ensure that there is sufficient funds for compensation and the applicant’s legal costs,” he said. Hill, who was then married, conducted a campaign of sexual harassment and bullying against Woman A over a 16-month period in 2017 and 2018, according to a reserved judgment. He was in breach of the Equalities Act in subjecting the claimant “to unwanted conduct of a sexual nature”. The breaches included a telephone call on the evening of 22 September 2017 in which he told the claimant he loved her; “getting into bed with the claimant on 11 December 2017 and rubbing his erection against her”; and “sexual assaults on occasions at the Westminster office”. He was also found to have victimised her with behaviour that included deactivating her security pass, ignoring her work-related text and emails, and terminating the claimant’s employment while stating he would put notice on the flat they shared in a text message. Hill resigned as a Labour MP in March 2021, resulting in a May byelection in Hartlepool and a victory for the Conservatives.
