1/18/2022,"A woman was shoved onto NYC subway tracks on Saturday, killing her. She has since been identified as Michelle Alyssa Go, 40. A witness told The New York Times that Go had her back to the suspect and never saw him coming. The woman shoved to her death onto a subway platform in Times Square never saw the person who did it, a witness told The New York Times. Michelle Alyssa Go, 40, was pushed from a Times Square - 42nd Street platform in front of a southbound Q train on Saturday. It happened around 9:30 a.m., New York City Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell said in a briefing not long after the Go's death. She was found under a subway train and declared dead at the scene, Sewell said. Maria Coste-Weber, the witness, told The Times that Go was preparing to board a train and had her back to the suspect. ""He started running with both of his hands in front of him, like, tackling,"" Coste-Weber told The Times. ""But it was so fast, nobody realized what was going on before it was too late."" ""She had her back to this crazy person ... She never saw anything,"" Coste-Weber said. The police later identified the suspect as Simon Martial, 61, and said he was charged with second-degree murder, the Associated Press reported. The NYPD said he turned himself in shortly after the attack. The police said Martial is homeless and has a criminal history. Video published by the New York Post showed the man shouting ""go fuck yourself"" to reporters outside a police station on Saturday. The police are investigating whether the attack on Go is a hate crime, the AP reported. Go was of Asian descent. Kathleen O'Reilly, chief of transit at the New York City Police Department, said in the Saturday briefing that multiple officers were on the platform at the time of the attack, but that it had been ""unpreventable."" Go worked in strategy and operations at Deloitte in New York, according to her LinkedIn page. Jonathan Gandal, a managing director at Deloitte, said the firm was ""shocked and deeply saddened by the loss of our colleague in this senseless act of violence,"" The Times reported.

1/18/2022,"By Syed Raza Hassan KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistani health authorities on Monday announced the completion of a successful clinical trial of Chinese traditional herbal medicine for treating COVID-19, as the South Asian nation enters a fifth wave of the pandemic driven by the Omicron variant. The Chinese medicine, Jinhua Qinggan Granules (JHQG) manufactured by Juxiechang (Beijing) pharmaceutical Co Ltd, is already being used in treatment of COVID-19 patients in China. ""Since it was tried on patients with different variants of COVID-19, we expect it to be effective on Omicron as on other variants,"" Professor Iqbal Chaudhry, director of the International Center for Chemical and Biological Science (ICCBS) where trials were conducted, told reporters. The trials were conducted on 300 patients who were treated at home, and would work on mild to moderate COVID-19 cases, Dr Raza Shah, principal investigator in the trials, told reporters, adding that the efficacy rate was around 82.67%. The trials were approved by the Drug Regulatory Authority Pakistan. Pakistan reported 4,340 COVID-19 cases on Monday, the highest recorded in a 24-hour period in three months. Karachi, the country's largest city, recorded a positivity rate - the percentage of tests coming back positive - of 39.39% at the weekend, the highest so far. ""In the last seven days, COVID cases in Pakistan have increased by 170% while deaths have also increased by 62%,"" the National Command Operation Centre (NCOC), which is overseeing the pandemic response, said in a tweet on Monday.

1/18/2022,"By Alexander Ratz and Pavel Polityuk KYIV (Reuters) - German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on Monday that she hoped mounting tensions with Russia over Ukraine could be solved by diplomacy, but she warned that Moscow would suffer if it does attack the country. ""Each further aggressive act will have a high price for Russia, economically, strategically, politically,"" Baerbock, in Kyiv on a trip that will next take her to Moscow, told a joint news conference with her Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba. ""Diplomacy is the only way."" Talks between Moscow and Western states on Russia's deployment of tens of thousands of troops along Ukraine's border ended with no breakthrough last week. A cyber attack against Ukraine has further inflamed tensions. Kuleba said Ukraine and Germany were united in pushing to revive four-way peace talks on ending the war in eastern Ukraine in the so-called ""Normandy"" format, which includes Germany, France, Ukraine and Russia. Excluded from much of last week's talks, Ukraine has repeatedly sought and received reassurances from allies that no decisions would be taken about its future without its involvement and assent. ""It is important for us now that neither Berlin nor Paris makes any decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine, and does not play any game behind our backs in relations with Russia. This is the key now,"" Kuleba said at the briefing. ""For this I want to thank Annalena for taking such a principled position."" Germany has supported Ukraine with aid and diplomatic backing in its standoff with Moscow since Russia seized the Crimean peninsula and backed separatists in the Donbass region in 2014. But there are points of contention. Ukraine opposes Nord Stream 2, a pipeline, yet to open, that would ship Russian gas to Germany, circumventing transit through Ukraine. Baerbock said the pipeline was now on hold and did not comply with European energy law. Kyiv has also bristled at Berlin's refusal to sell weapons to Ukraine. Ukraine's ambassador to Germany called the decision ""very frustrating and bitter"" in an interview with German media ahead of Baerbock's visit.

1/18/2022,"Morocco led the way in North Africa earlier this month when it became the first in the region to sign on to an implementation plan for China's massive infrastructure programme, the Belt and Road Initiative. Four other North African countries - Egypt, Libya, Tunisia and Algeria - have signed belt and road memorandums of understanding but Morocco is the first to go that one step further to detail the projects it and China will deliver. Moroccan Foreign Affairs Minister Nasser Bourita said the initiative would ""open up new prospects for trade and investment, and bring additional opportunities consistent with the kingdom's New Development Model"".

But where once that agreement would have been a near-guarantee for funding, it will now not necessarily translate into greater amounts of Chinese financing, particularly for major infrastructure, observers say. Morocco is among more than 50 African countries that have either signed belt and road implementation plans or MoUs with China, with newcomers last year including Guinea-Bissau, Eritrea, Sao Tome and Principe and the Central African Republic. In the past, joining the belt and road came with high prospects of funding, often for huge infrastructure projects, from Chinese policy banks Exim Bank of China and China Development Bank. But now those banks are now demanding feasibility studies amid debt distress in the continent. Benjamin Barton, an assistant professor at the University of Nottingham's Malaysia campus, said that with the slowdown in the Chinese economy and a generally more inward-looking and conservative approach from Beijing, ""the heady days of ill-considered projects and wild spending have been - temporarily - put to rest"". Barton said funding would become more austere and driven by financial, environmental, social and political factors - rather than ""just agreeing to projects for the sake of racking up project numbers"". He said that for China the focus of the belt and road was less about expanding the roll-out to increase the scope to fund new projects and more about enlarging ""membership"" to increase the initiative's legitimacy. Barton said that since the belt and road was designed mainly to sway countries in the Global South, the more African states that signed MoUs to join, the better. ""China will continue to strive to get countries in the Global South to sign up to the [belt and road] in a bid to eventually have all countries in the Global South part of it,"" he said. Lauren Johnston, a visiting senior lecturer at the University of Adelaide and founder of New South Economics, agreed that Chinese investment was changing. She said that in the recent past, big Chinese investments were involved in large infrastructure projects, especially in the energy sector. ""[But] now the focus is on realising some of that value such as getting the exports moving, and getting employment going up, and moving some of the value chains,"" Johnston said. She said investment flows, including financing, moved in ""waves and lumps"" and did not have to rise continuously ""to express continuous commitment from China"". She also said the belt and road was only a decade old and just a title for outbound investment, trade, regional and cross-regional integration. ""That most African countries are signed up just says they are not against China. It doesn't itself signify anything else at all or even that. It's symbolic. But giving that face may help in fostering bilateral ties,"" Johnston said. ""What matters is the jobs being created, the new export opportunities, the students getting trained on scholarship, the new areas that have electricity at home and the lives saved at hospitals."" Mark Bohlund, a senior credit research analyst at REDD Intelligence, said the belt and road had been ""exaggerated as a driver of Chinese lending in Africa"" and membership did not necessarily trigger new or more financing from China. ""Overall Chinese lending to Africa [peaked] in 2013, the year the [belt and road] was unveiled,"" Bohlund said. He said Beijing signalled at November's Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in Dakar that it would continue to shift its official financial engagements with Africa towards trade financing and supporting Chinese equity-based investment rather than the large lending for infrastructure projects. He said the new additions to the initiative could be seen as a political development. ""For Beijing, the main incentive is to tie [belt and road] countries closer politically and increase its support in forums such as the UN General Assembly,"" Bohlund said. Kanyi Lui, an international finance lawyer at law firm Pinsent Masons in Beijing, also saw a shift away from just infrastructure projects. Lui, who has advised on more than 100 cross-border lending transactions involving Chinese lenders in power, resources and infrastructure projects, said Chinese lending in Africa would likely refocus to facilitating exports from the continent and providing liquidity to local banks. ""Unlike financing large construction projects, these trade financings tend to involve much longer relationships and should enhance connectivity and exchange between the host country and China,"" he said. ""We expect to see smaller but higher quality investments from China into Africa, particularly in relation to productive assets and activities which can benefit from the big infrastructure projects commissioned previously, and also boost the local economy by promoting exports."" During the Dakar meeting, Chinese President Xi Jinping promised US$10 billion in trade finance to support African exports and another US$10 billion in credit lines for financial institutions. But Xi did not say how much would go into bilateral project finance in Africa. However, Lui said this did not mean China would exit infrastructure in Africa. ""This is an area where China has a unique strength and a large pipeline of projects was built up over the last decade."" However, he said commercial banks working with multilateral lenders would probably take on an even more active role in the financing of these projects in the future.

1/18/2022,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The son of former Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos defeated on Monday a bid to disqualify him from the May 9 presidential race but still faces other petitions from human rights victims and others who have raised alarm over atrocities under his late father's rule. The Commission on Elections rejected a petition arguing that Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. should be barred from public office for having been convicted of failing to file income tax returns from 1982 to 1985 and stating in his candidacy papers that he had never been found guilty of a crime. The ruling is appealable. “Respondent did not deliberately attempt to mislead, misinform or deceive the electorate,” the ruling said. Marcos Jr. has led in popularity polls ahead of the election. “This is one challenge down,” commission spokesman James Jimenez told reporters. “But there are other challenges still pending.” He said there five other petitions against Marcos Jr.’s candidacy, three of which have been consolidated into one case. Marcos Jr.'s name will be included on the ballot, which will be printed soon, despite the pending petitions, Jimenez said. Marcos Jr.’s camp thanked the elections commission “for upholding the law and the right of every bona fide candidate like Bongbong Marcos to run for public office free from any form of harassment and discrimination.” The elder Marcos placed the Philippines under martial rule in 1972, a year before his term was to expire. He padlocked Congress and newspaper offices, ordered the arrest of political opponents and ruled by decree. He was toppled in an army-backed “people power” revolt in 1986. He died in exile in Hawaii three years later without admitting any wrongdoing, including accusations that he and his family amassed an estimated $5 billion to $10 billion while he was in power. A Hawaii court found him liable for human rights violations and awarded $2 billion from his estate to compensate more than 9,000 Filipinos who filed a lawsuit against him for torture, incarceration, extrajudicial killings and disappearances. His widow, Imelda Marcos, and her children were allowed to return to the Philippines in 1991. They have since made a political comeback, winning seats in Congress and powerful provincial posts. Marcos Jr. has called the allegations against his father “lies.” He has joined hands with Davao city Mayor Sara Duterte, President Rodrigo Duterte’s daughter, as his vice presidential running mate. Duterte backs his daughter’s run but opposes her pairing with Marcos Jr. and has vowed to never support him.",World/Associated Press,Philippine dictator's son defeats bid vs. presidential run,https://news.yahoo.com/philippine-dictators-son-defeats-bid-092245511.html
