12/10/2021,"Last Christmas was probably the worst my wife and I had spent together in all the years we have been together. We had long since accepted there was no chance of our daughter coming over from the US but the final straw was when the Covid guidelines were changed and we were unable even to see our son and his girlfriend for the day. So we glumly ate a small chicken and watched TV before sneaking off to bed round about 9pm. Now it’s looking as if we were mugs for sticking to the rules as those inside No 10 were ignoring them by holding a series of after-work parties. So far the government has not tried to deny that these gatherings took place – other than to say whatever happened was not a party – and its lines of defence have become increasingly ropey. First we have had Boris Johnson saying no one cared what happened a year ago and that an investigation wasn’t in the public interest. This was a line pursued by Dominic Raab, the justice secretary, on the Marr programme when he said the police didn’t bother to investigate crimes that had happened in the past – news for watchers of Silent Witness and Unforgotten. Though possibly Raab is under the impression the only crimes worth solving are those that have yet to be committed. Then on today’s media round, we had Kit Malthouse, the policing minister, saying he had been assured that even if a party had taken place, – which he couldn’t confirm as he hadn’t been there – then it definitely took place within the guidelines because the music had been very quiet and someone had opened the windows. Or something. Despite the fact that any gatherings were banned. No 10 just doesn’t seem to get how angry everyone is about this. Nor how many will think twice about breaking the rules if they are changed again before Xmas.  For reasons I don’t fully understand, my powers of concentration for reading have fallen off a cliff since the first lockdown. Before the pandemic I could easily manage one book a week, but now I can barely manage one every month or so. And the only books I seem to be able to read are non-fiction. The only fiction I have read since March 2020 has been a not very thrilling Scandi-noir thriller whose title I can’t even remember. It’s quite possible it was a great book and the problem was me. Just recently I have been forcing myself to make more time for reading, mostly about the coronavirus. Two books I have particularly enjoyed are Michael Lewis’s The Premonition – the story of the US scientists who tried to get the state to take a pandemic seriously – and Hilary Cooper and Simon Szreter’s After the Virus, an historical analysis, which begins with the introduction of the first poor laws in 1601 that enabled Britain to handle plagues, crop failures and recessions better than anywhere else in Europe for 200 years, moves on through the individualism of the 19th and early 20th century, the re-emergence of the welfare state post-second world war and the subsequent slide into neo-liberalism, and looks at why the UK was initially the worst hit country in Europe. Their call for a return to a greater influence of the state is heartfelt. But I think it’s time to give myself a break from Covid so this Christmas, I am determined to branch out. I’m normally a sucker for political diaries, but I rate my chances of getting through the 1,000 pages-plus of the full Henry ‘“Chips” Channon diaries as nil. So it will have to be Jane Ridley’s biography of George V and the new, posthumously published, John Le Carre. What better novel with which to dip my toes back into fiction? Durham University has got itself into an entirely predictable mess after Prof Tim Luckhurst, the principal of one of its colleges, failed to tell students he had invited Rod Liddle to give the after-dinner speech before getting them to fork out £10 each for the privilege of attending the Christmas gala. Needless to say Liddle raced through his favourite topics of sex workers, trans rights and institutional racism and got exactly the response he had been hoping for. Some students walked out, some heckled and some refused to applaud, while Luckhurst yelled out, calling them pathetic and woke for being unwilling to tolerate views that did not agree with their own. Luckhurst has since been asked to apologise for his actions and it’s not yet clear if the university will take any further sanctions against him. My sympathies are with the students. After all, I’d have been a bit pissed off to discover Liddle was the guest speaker after forking out for the ticket. And it wasn’t as if the college was offering everyone the chance to get their money back when they found out. It’s not that I’m against students having their views challenged, it’s just that you would have hoped the college principal could have found someone with more academic credibility to do so. Liddle is at heart just a provocateur: all he wants is a reaction and he got just the one he wanted. Maybe future audiences could just play it a little cannier. Either by sitting out the entire speech in silence or, better still, by carrying on talking while he is speaking. Liddle would hate that. The Downing Street parties that never happened story has become increasingly surreal. Following the leak of footage from the Downing Street “Lying Room” – aka the £2.6m briefing room that was only used for No 10 to practise lying to the country – and the subsequent resignation of Allegra Stratton for joking about breaking the Covid guidelines, Johnson has continued to insist the parties, reports of which are increasing faster than the Omicron variant, never took place. Despite this, Johnson has instructed Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, to investigate the parties for which he claims to have been given cast-iron assurances that they never took place. Let’s just hope Case wasn’t the person who gave the prime minister those assurances. And if the cabinet secretary finds it hard to distinguish between people who were too pissed to know if they were there or not and those who merely imagined the whole thing, he could do worse than interview Dilyn the Dog, on the off chance he was one of the canine superbrains identified by academics at Dalhousie University in Canada that can identify 215 words. Case could take Dilyn around various rooms in Downing Street to see if he reacts to “Who’s taken my Secret Santa?” and “Don’t chuck wine over the new wallpaper”. There again, Dilyn could be a Doggy Dunce, like my own Herbert Hound who can only identify 15 words. The chaos in Westminster continues with Johnson now reported to have misled Lord Geidt, the independent adviser on ministers’ interests, about when he discovered Lord Brownlow – we all need a man like the deep-pocketed Brownlow in our lives – was paying for the expensive refurb of his Downing Street flat. There is surprise from some quarters that Johnson has been found out to be lying again, but lying is what sociopathic narcissists do. The real surprise would be for Johnson to be caught out telling the truth. He had intended this week to be “crime week”, in which he reset the dial after some bumpy headlines with some popular law and order announcements to please the rank and file of the Tory party. All he’s done is given the police more potential crimes to investigate. As for me, even though I’ve yet to buy half my presents, Christmas can’t come a moment too soon. This year, it’s all about having the family all together for the first time in two and a half years. Fingers crossed. Next Saturday, our daughter Anna and her husband are due to arrive from the US to be with us for nearly three weeks, and in the following week our son and his girlfriend will also be coming to stay, even though my wife has converted his bedroom into her pottery studio. So I could do without the government having to rapidly change the Covid regulations – is there anything dafter than being encouraged to work from home while also being urged to go out and get trashed with your friends at an office party? – just to distract from more wrongdoing. Is that too much to ask? I’m just keeping my head down and hoping to avoid the Omicron variant. So a happy and safe Xmas to everyone, thank you for the support so many of you gave me when I was severely depressed earlier in the year and see you on the other side in 2022.

12/10/2021,"If TV quiz fans think Jasamrit Rahala’s face looks familiar, they would be right. The 17-year-old from Slough has reached the knockout finals of Channel 4’s Countdown, having been a fan of the programme since primary school. But for Jasamrit, identified as a maths prodigy aged nine, Countdown is just the latest in a string of gameshow endeavours, having become the youngest finalist on Child Genius aged 10 and competed in Britain’s Brightest Family.  Now studying double maths, physics and computer sciences A-levels at Eton College, having won a prestigious king’s scholarship, which covers his fees, Jasamrit has his eye on University Challenge and Mastermind. “I’ve always watched Countdown, since I was six or seven. And I noticed I would get the teatime teasers and decided as soon as I could I would apply,” he said. He applied on his 16th birthday – the age limit for the show – but the pandemic meant he did not appear until he was 17. He was among the series’ top scorers, earning a place in the finals. “I like computer science and maths, and I guess it’s pattern recognition,” said the schoolboy, whose next game will air on 17 December. Having been identified as a gifted pupil in year 3 and achieved a maximum 162 Mensa IQ score at 11, Jasamrit’s talent has proved challenging for his parents. When not at Eton he lives with his father Santokh, mother Sardeep, a part-time NHS healthcare assistant, and sister Tania, 12, in a modest two-up, two-down in Slough. His father said he was embarrassed to admit he didn’t spot his son’s potential early on. “I was working every hour to make ends meet, long hours, and travelling to and from work,” said Santokh, 55, now a work coach for the Department for Work and Pensions having been made redundant from a 20-year job as a buyer for a food and drink company during the pandemic. When he realised Jasamrit was very smart, “we just didn’t know what to do. There is no roadmap. Parents don’t know what to do when they have a clever child, and nor do schools.” With money tight, Santokh scoured charity shops and car boot sales “finding old books wherever I could find them,” to encourage his son’s talent. “Our family motto is: poor books, rich words,” he said. Jasamrit scored top marks in the 11-plus and passed entrance exams for five fee-paying private schools. But owing to the family’s finances he went to Herschel grammar school, within walking distance of home. At 13 he was accepted at Eton, and he now hopes to attend a top university studying computer sciences. He puts his success down to a good balance of “work, rest and play”. He plays the violin, rows, plays badminton and hockey, has volunteered at his local Sikh temple and tutors online. “When I applied to Countdown, the only thing going through my mind was not to get knocked out in the first round. I do these things just for the fun of it. If it goes wrong, it goes wrong, and if it doesn’t it’s a nice experience,” he said. It doesn’t always go right. He, his father and his cousin Parvon were knocked out in the first round of ITV’s Britain’s Brightest Family. “We don’t talk about that one,” he laughed. Now he is trying to muster a team for the BBC Two show Only Connect. “I don’t know who he gets it from. Must be his mother,” said Santokh, who said his children were encouraged to spend one hour a day on maths and another on English in addition to their school homework. “We are just super proud of him.”",Arts/Television & radio,"‘Just for the fun of it’: Countdown star, 17, targets more TV success",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/10/countdown-star-jasamrit-rahala-17-targets-more-tv-success
12/10/2021,"Restaurants suffered a sharp drop in activity, manufacturers reported zero growth, and output in the construction industry collapsed in October at the fastest rate since the first wave of Covid-19 last year. Even before the emergence of the coronavirus Omicron variant, Britain’s economy was displaying worrying signs of weakness that are hard to ignore. According to the latest official figures for October, gross domestic product barely rose on the month, with an unexpectedly sluggish 0.1% growth rate.  Suggesting the rapid recovery from lockdown risked stalling entirely amid supply constraints and a dwindling of consumer appetite, activity in the food and beverage sector fell by 7.5%, while construction slumped by 1.8%. Worse is yet to come. With tighter government restrictions and consumers reacting with caution above and beyond the official rules, the big fear is the October growth snapshot might be as good as it gets for several months to come. Hospitality firms are warning of a slew of cancelled Christmas parties and a fall in people eating out since news of the Omicron variant first broke, while tour operators and airlines report a dip in winter holiday bookings. Work from home orders will inevitably lead to a drop in spending in town and city centres, hitting consumer-facing businesses hardest. On the positive side, the latest figures show the economy is within a hair’s breadth of its pre-Covid position, at only 0.5% below February 2020 levels. The new restrictions announced so far remain relatively light-touch, while there are hopes that tougher measures may not be required, thanks to steady progress with the vaccine booster programme. However, pressure is clearly building on an economy that was already struggling for momentum before the new variant emerged, while there is heightened uncertainty over the next stage in a pandemic that is far from over. Faced with these risks, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said he had always acknowledged there would be “bumps on the road” to recovery but the government already had in place an “ongoing £400bn economic support package” to keep the country on track. That’s an odd way to describe a programme that has been largely dismantled over recent months, ostensibly because Sunak believed a return to economic normality was on the cards. The furlough scheme has gone, universal credit has been slashed and several tax breaks have been reversed. Business leaders are stepping up their warnings that failure to provide renewed support measures could squander the progress made in the economy since the easing of lockdown earlier this year; especially in the sectors most exposed to the Omicron wave, such as hospitality, travel and leisure. Despite soaring inflationary pressures exhibited this autumn, it would also be out of step for the Bank of England to raise interest rates next week. Speculation had been that Threadneedle Street would leap into action after bottling a rate rise in November. But with evidence of fading demand in the economy and the heightened uncertainty because of Omicron, waiting until early next year would seem wise. Pressure on household budgets is, however, only likely to intensify early next year. Energy bills are expected to be ratcheted higher come April, inflation is forecast to outstrip wage growth, council tax will go up and the government’s new social care levy will be introduced. Analysts are warning that Britain’s economy is likely to head into reverse this winter. The extent of the setback will depend on how long government restrictions remain in place, how businesses and households react to Omicron risks, and the willingness of the Treasury and the Bank to cushion the blow.",News/Business,UK economy risks heading into reverse unless Rishi Sunak offers more help,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/10/uk-economy-risks-heading-into-reverse-unless-rishi-sunak-offers-more-help
12/10/2021,"Octopus Energy has raised $300m of investment to value the power supplier at $5bn – despite soaring energy prices that have triggered a wave of collapses among its rivals. The long-term tie-up with Canada Pension Plan (CPP) Investment Board is the second big investment in Octopus Energy since the start of the energy crisis during which dozens of smaller supply rivals have folded.  More than 20 UK energy companies have gone bust in a little over 12 weeks after a record rise in energy market prices, including the biggest, Bulb Energy, which was unable to raise funds from investors to keep supplying its 1.7 million customers. The latest equity investment in Octopus backs its founder Greg Jackson’s plan to bring a “digital revolution” to the energy industry, and will help fund the company’s global expansion target of reaching 100 million worldwide customers. The energy startup has reached the $5bn mark a little over 18 months after it first reached “unicorn status” with a $1bn valuation in spring 2020, and five years after it was founded in 2016. Deborah Orida, the global head of real assets at CPP Investments, described the deal as “a perfect example of how investors can work with leading tech-enabled energy companies to digitally disrupt the global energy system and support the evolution to a low-carbon world”. It comes three months after Octopus secured up to $600m (£438m) from an investment fund set up by the former US vice-president Al Gore in September, which valued the company at approximately $4.6bn, to build on the growth driven by its green energy platform. The in-house technology platform, known as Kraken, uses machine learning to manage energy supply and electricity generation data digitally, which helps to unlock a low-cost and efficient use of renewable energy sources. Octopus uses the technology to supply 3 million UK households with energy – as well as customers in Germany, Spain, Italy, New Zealand, Japan and the US – and has licensed the technology to other energy companies including E.ON UK, Good Energy, EDF, Hanwha and Origin Energy. In total Kraken is used to supply 25m customer accounts and manage 3GW of electricity generation. Octopus plans to use Kraken to reach 100 million customers by 2027. Octopus Energy, which is owned by Octopus Group, also took its first steps into renewable energy generation this year by buying its sister company Octopus Renewables in a move that will hand the startup a portfolio of about 300 renewable energy projects, across six different countries, or enough to power more than 1.2m homes. Greg Jackson, Octopus Energy’s founder and chief executive, said CPP’s investment will help to drive further innovation and “accelerate investment into the renewable energy revolution” which is “vital to delivering governments’ net zero goals”.",News/Business,Octopus Energy raises long-term investment to value startup at $5bn,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/10/octopus-energy-raises-long-term-investment-to-value-startup-at-5bn
12/10/2021,"Good morning. Two Democratic senators have resisted Joe Biden’s vaccine-or-test mandate for large businesses despite having the support of scientists and public health experts.  The US Senate on Wednesday evening voted to overturn the mandate as new cases and hospitalizations continue rising in the country. The West Virginia senator Joe Manchin, who co-sponsored the bill, and Montana’s Senator Jon Tester crossed Democratic party lines to vote yes and join 50 Republicans in their political opposition to the public health policy, illustrating problems the US president faces even within a faction of his own party, The bill is seen as a largely symbolic gesture, since it would also need to pass the Democratic-led House and would probably be vetoed by Biden. Why did they co-sign the bill? Manchin, who is vaccinated and boosted, said the rule represents federal overreach. “It is not the place of the federal government to tell private business owners how to protect their employees from Covid-19,” he said. Donald Trump, the former US president, suffered a major defeat on Thursday when a federal appeals court ruled against his effort to block the release of documents related to the 6 January attack on the US Capitol. Trump is expected to appeal to the supreme court. A select committee in the House of Representatives is investigating the events on and surrounding 6 January, when a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol in an attempt to disrupt the certification of Joe Biden’s election win. Amid scenes of violence that shocked the US and the world, five people eventually died and scores were injured. Trump and a clique of his close advisers have repeatedly engaged in legal action over the committee’s investigations, including refusing to cooperate with it. What did the court decide? In a 3-0 decision, the United States court of appeals for the District of Columbia said there was a “unique legislative need” for documents that the committee has requested. What did the judge say? In a 68-page ruling, Judge Patricia Ann Millett wrote: “On the record before us, former President Trump has provided no basis for this court to override President Biden’s judgment.” A jury has found the Empire actor Jussie Smollett guilty of faking a hate crime against himself to raise his celebrity profile. The Chicago jury, which deliberated for more than nine hours, found Smollett guilty of five charges of disorderly conduct. He was acquitted on a sixth count, of lying to a detective in mid-February, weeks after Smollett said he was attacked. The charges against Smollett, who is Black and gay, had become a touchstone in the US’s culture wars at the intersection of culture, racism, politics and celebrity. Many fellow stars initially rushed to support Smollett when he first made the accusations in January 2019. What did Smollett say happened to him? Smollett told police that he had been assaulted on a darkened street by two masked men who yelled racist and homophobic slurs. He later denied any wrongdoing. What actually happened? Two brothers testified that Smollett had recruited them to fake an attack on him and paid them $3,500. Prosecutors described the evidence against Smollett as “overwhelming”. A cargo truck jammed with more than 100 people thought to be migrants from Central America has rolled over and crashed into a pedestrian bridge in southern Mexico, killing at least 53 people and injuring dozens more. Julian Assange can be extradited to the US, the high court has ruled as it overturned a judgment earlier this year. The decision deals a major blow to the Wikileaks co-founder’s efforts to prevent his extradition to the US to face espionage charges, although options to appeal remain open to his legal team. A Manhattan hotel has reopened as a homeless shelter despite protest from Billionaires Row residents. The residents spent more than $300,000 in lawsuits claiming “crime and loitering” by the occupants would lead to ‘irreparable injuries’. Joe Biden has phoned the leaders of Ukraine and nine eastern European Nato states promising support if Russia attacks Ukraine. He also reassured the leaders that nothing would be agreed with Russia about the region behind the backs of its countries. Ghislaine Maxwell’s New York sex-trafficking trial was unexpectedly adjourned early Thursday because an ill attorney needed medical care. The mid-morning adjournment meant that prosecutors were not able to rest their case against Maxwell yesterday. The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits plunged last week to the lowest level in 52 years, more evidence that the US job market is recovering from last year’s coronavirus recession. Unemployment claims dropped by 43,000 to 184,000 last week, the lowest since September 1969, the labor department said Thursday. The four-week moving average fell below 219,000, the lowest since the pandemic hit the United States hard in March 2020. Last year, with little warning, a new Amazon delivery station brought the rumble of semi-trailer trucks and delivery vans to Chicago’s Gage Park neighborhood.

A joint investigation with Consumer Reports has found people of color and low-income residents are disproportionately affected. Introduced in 2020, “Untact” is a South Korean government policy that aims to spur economic growth by removing layers of human interaction from society. It gathered pace during the pandemic and is expanding rapidly across sectors from healthcare, to business and entertainment. The push to create contactless services is designed increase productivity and cut bureaucracy but has also fuelled concerns over the potential social consequences. Grapes are among the most sensitive crops to climate changes. For some producers, warming temperatures have been advantageous, at least in the short term. Changing rain patterns, earlier springs and droughts are starting to push wine production towards the poles. However, for many wine growers the climate crisis is making life much harder. As the crisis intensifies, growers around the world are scrambling to find solutions. A man attacked by a pack of otters in a Singapore park has said that he thought he was going to die during the ordeal. Graham George Spencer, a British citizen living in Singapore, said he had been chased, pinned down and bitten “26 times in 10 seconds” by a family of otters while out for an early morning walk in the botanic gardens. He said they had lunged at him, biting his ankles, legs and buttocks and causing him to fall over. “I actually thought I was going to die – they were going to kill me,” he said.

12/10/2021,"Officials in the US are encouraging eligible adults to get boosters amid a new surge of the Covid-19 pandemic and the discovery of the Omicron variant, but some areas are facing shortages – not of the vaccines, but of pharmacy staff to administer them. More than two in three Covid vaccines are now given at pharmacies, the White House has said, but pharmacies are facing a double bind of increased workloads and staffing shortages and are struggling to keep up with demand for vaccination appointments.  “I’m not having trouble getting the vaccines. It’s just the availability for me to be able to give vaccines,” Janice Spinney, the owner and sole pharmacist at Valley Independent Pharmacy in Intervale, New Hampshire, told the Guardian. She’s the only one at her independent pharmacy, located in a rural mountain town, who can administer the vaccines. She offers vaccination appointments every two weeks. “There’s definitely demand, but because of the way that the vaccine comes in multi-dose vials, you have to make sure that you have enough people to fill the slot when you open it, so that you don’t waste it,” Spinney said. She’s still getting requests for the next appointment slot, which she hasn’t even advertised, she said. New Hampshire has the highest rate of new Covid cases in the US, even though 65% of its population – more than the national average – is fully vaccinated. It’s the worst phase of the pandemic for the small New England state, as hospitals are stretched to capacity. Those looking for the added protection of boosters in New Hampshire have seen long wait times, despite a “booster blitz” campaign the state recently launched in response to rising cases. But these delays and shortages aren’t limited to independent pharmacies and hard-hit states. Some large chain pharmacies around the country have shortened their hours and canceled appointments, sometimes without any notice. Walgreens pharmacies in Maine, Colorado, Connecticut and Indiana have reportedly closed unexpectedly or reduced their hours because of worker shortages. In Indianapolis, a CVS pharmacy closed early on Thursday due to worker shortages, and a sign over the counter informed customers of a half-hour closure each day to give the pharmacist a lunch break. While Walgreens has “adjusted pharmacy hours in a limited number of stores to accommodate current staffing needs,” Fraser Engerman, a spokesperson for Walgreens, told the Guardian in an email, “the vast majority of our stores” are operating normally. And, he said, Walgreens administered a record number of Covid-19 vaccines last week. Matt Blanchette, a spokesperson for CVS Health, said that CVS pharmacies “have the inventory to meet Covid-19 vaccine needs”, and stores are ramping up vaccination availability times and hiring new employees. It’s not just pharmacies bearing additional burdens. In Albuquerque, health officials lamented having “trouble securing venues” to offer mass vaccine events like those offered for initial shots earlier in the year. “It’s absolutely incredible that we have the demand we do for boosters, and it is critically important,” Rebecca Snead, executive vice-president of the National Alliance of State Pharmacy Associations (NASPA), told the Guardian. But, like other health care appointments, there may be wait times, she said. “I can’t just go in and get it what I want when I want it. I have to plan for it.” She likened the added demand for boosters to a funnel. “Everybody’s trying to get through the funnel,” she said. “All of healthcare is and has been strained, and the capacity is exceeding the ability.” Like other health care industries, pharmacies were often at capacity even before the pandemic hit. Drugstores are usually busy this time of year with flu vaccines. They are still administering first and second doses of the Covid vaccines, including to children over the age of five who recently became eligible, and they’ve seen a rise in Covid testing – all on top of their usual work, which is being delayed by the influx of work. “To step aside and put that time out for vaccinations, away from the dispensing requirements that you have today – it is a struggle,” Spinney said. Burnout among pharmacists and pharmacy technicians has been “no different” than among other health workers, Snead said. “We’ve been on a treadmill running as fast as we can for a couple of years now.” Unlike the rollout of earlier doses, there are fewer mass vaccination sites for boosters, and many of the volunteers who stepped in to administer vaccines have gone back to their regular jobs. “There are fewer helpers to make it all work,” Snead said. Yet vaccinations – whether for initial doses or for booster shots – are one important element to stopping surges, including from the Omicron variant. Peter McGinn, an analyst in Minnesota, was the first Omicron patient detected in the US. He said the vaccines “absolutely” helped keep his case mild – he got boosted right before his trip to New York, and encouraged others to do the same in order to reduce hospitalizations and deaths. “The exciting news is that we have a booster, we have an adequate supply, we have a workforce that is trying their best to get as many people boosters as possible,” Snead said. “​​We need people to get motivated to get their booster. We also need them to understand it’s a healthcare service.” She urged people to book their appointments in advance, and to be patient. “To be a health care provider that has provided 70% of a life-saving vaccine to this country – of course there’s pride,” Snead said. “Does everybody appreciate and understand that that has come with a tremendous personal and professional sacrifice every day?”",News/Society,Staff shortages are hobbling vaccination campaigns as demand runs high,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/10/covid-vaccine-booster-pharmacy-staff
12/10/2021,"Just a few steps away from the horse-drawn carriages that whisk tourists through New York’s Central Park and the opulence of the Plaza Hotel is an unassuming building on a quiet block in midtown Manhattan. The building is marked by an awning that reads “Park Savoy Hotel”. Nestled in between a 24-hour parking structure and an apartment building on a predominantly residential street, the Park Savoy blends in with the other hotels in the neighborhood.  A sign on the front window of the building that says “Welcome to the Park Savoy rapid re-housing program” is the only marker that indicates it is a homeless shelter, built in one of the most pricey neighborhoods in New York. One that rich locals fought for years, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars campaigning against the crime and “irreparable injuries” they said it would bring – fears that appear to have been unfounded. The shelter quietly opened its doors in early November. It is designed to house up to 80 men and is known as an “employment shelter” meant for those who are seeking employment or who are actively employed, especially in midtown Manhattan. The shelter has been taking in about five new occupants a week since it opened 8 November, according to a city spokesperson. The men will be neighbors with some of Manhattan’s wealthiest residents: the shelter abuts Billionaires Row, a nickname given to the cluster of super-tall luxury “pencil towers” that were constructed within the last decade. The penthouse of One57, the tower that is directly behind the shelter, was bought by billionaire Michael Dell in 2014 for $100m – the most expensive piece of real estate ever sold in the city at the time. New York City has the highest homeless population in the US with more than 122,000 homeless adults and families – including more than 39,000 children – living in the city’s shelter system in 2020. In 2017, a year before the shelter was supposed to open, de Blasio announced a new initiative to address homelessness in the city which included plans to build about 90 new shelters. “They’ll be in every kind of neighborhood,” de Blasio said. The Park Savoy shelter was slated to open in spring 2018, but the city entered a lengthy legal battle with residents and business owners in the area who vehemently opposed the shelter and formed a group, called the West 58th Street Coalition to block it. An online petition created in 2018 against the hotel, calling it a threat with “an enormous impact on our densely populated, narrow, high pedestrian-traffic street” garnered nearly 3,500 signatures. Members of the coalition argued that the city did not receive community input when starting plans to open the shelter and called the building “a dangerous fire trap”. Suzanne Silverstein, a leader of the coalition, told the New York Times that residents believed that the city was trying to make a statement at their expense. “[Mayor Bill de Blasio] is not sticking it to billionaires, he’s sticking it to people like myself who work 100 hours a week. We’re not bad people. We’re just trying to get ahead,” she said. Determined to stop the shelter, the West 58th Street Coalition filed a lawsuit in 2018 that argued the building was too “unsafe” for occupants and that “crime and loitering” caused by the shelter would lead to “irreparable injuries”. The coalition also spent at least $287,000 toward lobbyists advocating against the shelter, according to non-profit news site The City. They spent another $100,000 on billboards in Iowa meant to prod de Blasio during his brief run for president in 2020. Despite the coalition’s efforts, a state appellate court gave the final green light to the city in May to open the shelter. The group did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment. Steve Banks, commissioner for the city’s Department of Homeless Services, told The City that the campaign against the shelter was “the longest and the most-well-funded litigation” against the opening of any shelter. Battles against homeless shelters have erupted across the city in recent years. Manhattan’s Upper West Side was embroiled in a debate over a luxury hotel that temporarily became an emergency homeless shelter during the pandemic as the city attempted to space out occupants in shelters. Most recently, residents of a neighborhood in Queens have voiced concerns over multiple homeless shelters that have opened within a few blocks of each other. Advocates for the homeless say that fears of homeless shelters are typically overblown, creating a hostile environment for those who need a place to live. “Usually it’s a lot of fears and anxiety that don’t actually materialize once the shelters open,” said Jacquelyn Simone, policy director for the homeless advocacy group Coalition for the Homeless. Simone noted that the court’s ruling in favor of the city shows that the city can prevail in lawsuits against homeless shelters. “One must ask who would have benefited from the Park Savoy shelter if it hadn’t been stalled for this many years,” she said. While many new homeless shelters are met with opposition, some have been met with indifference and even community support. Despite vocal opposition against shelters on the Upper West Side in Manhattan and Kensington in Brooklyn, residents of both neighborhoods organized donation drives for local shelters. On a Tuesday morning almost a month after the Park Savoy shelter opened, the block seemed like any other street in midtown Manhattan, full of fast-walking office workers and groups of tourists heading to Times Square. Despite the legal battle that took place over the Park Savoy, residents of the neighborhood told the Guardian that the shelter’s opening has so far caused no problems. “I was very apprehensive about it for various reasons,” said John, who lives in a neighboring building and wished to be referred to only by his first name. “I had a feeling there would be these real bums moving in, but I’ve seen no problems at all.” “I see one or two people going in, but they look harmless.” One woman walking her dog who moved to the neighborhood a few months ago said she did not realize a homeless shelter had opened. John Sheehan, who lives in the neighborhood and works in advocacy for homeless living on the street, said he hopes the community will eventually embrace the shelter once people realize it will not affect the quality of the neighborhood. “I think the shelter is a statement that says we are willing to give people an opportunity to move on, to improve their lives, and to have a safe place to live,” Sheehan said. “That should be something we should be proud of.”",News/US news,Manhattan hotel reopens as homeless shelter despite protest from Billionaires Row residents,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/10/new-york-hotel-reopens-homeless-shelter-billionaires-row
12/10/2021,"It’s only now, when we have some distance from it, that we can reckon with last winter: five months of gloom, seclusion and burnout in which almost the entire country felt miserable. Against a background of a rising death toll, exhausted health workers and gross governmental incompetence – not to mention a cancelled Christmas – we were tasked with a third go at making the most of a bad situation. I remember the moment it really got to me. It was New Year’s Eve. I’d just had a terrible and prolonged breakup, and a few days earlier had moved out of the London flat I had shared with my ex for five years. House-sitting, alone, was not the kind of New Year bash I’d envisioned, but at least I could take some solace in the thought that no one else was having much fun.  Another single friend and I had planned to visit a couple’s home for a tiny – admittedly rule-breaking – dinner, so we wouldn’t be alone as the countdown came. But at 4pm that day, I got the call: one of our party had just watched the viral video of a UCL intensive care doctor speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live. He had said anyone who went out on New Year’s Eve would have blood on their hands. “Sure,” I said, lip quivering like a toddler’s as I was told the dinner was off, “glad we’re doing the right thing.” I put the phone down and realised I was horrified at the prospect of spending the night alone. Lockdown and winter had formed a pernicious partnership. Together they aggravated every other malady in life – overwork, illness, cold, death, loneliness, heartbreak – breathing a frosty wind over any attempts to try to mitigate the misery. A disease that insisted we stay outdoors as much as possible was bound to strike its biggest psychological blows when we felt trapped indoors. As winter returns, you can sense the trepidation. Even if the rules in the UK stay the same, we know that things won’t get back to normal this Christmas. Many offices have decided to cancel or downscale their staff parties, and now there’s the new Omicron variant to contend with. One of the leading spokespeople for the delivery industry, David Jinks of ParcelHero, has described Christmas shortages as “a certainty”. Even Tory MP David Morris has warned that we could be facing a new “winter of discontent”. For many of us, our anxiety about and inability to deal with winter is due to the fact that, despite its inevitability, we seem totally unprepared for it each year. Is there a way to reframe this period as something more positive – or even embrace it? It’s the time of year that people start throwing around the term “Sad”, short for seasonal affective disorder, and purchasing light therapy lamps. “I do think all the focus on the lamps simplifies the treatment in a rather unfortunate way,” says Dr Norman E Rosenthal, whose research on winter depression in the early 1980s led to him coining the term Sad to describe a form of depression that comes and goes in a seasonal pattern, and recommended artificial daylight lamps for those who suffer from it. “People think: ‘Use a lightbox and everything will be fine.’” Rosenthal’s book, Winter Blues, first published in 1993, remains in print and as popular as ever. It estimates that while 5% of people suffer clinically from Sad, a further 15% have some milder version of what he calls the winter blues. “It’s a matter of degrees,” he says. There is a clear difference between the two – the former tends to be manageable, whereas Sad can permeate your entire life and should be taken seriously (the NHS outlines persistent symptoms: low mood, lethargy, irritability, feelings of despair and worthlessness). I’m sure I don’t have either – but there’s still something wobbly about this winter in particular, an unease about the next four months and a struggle to remember what it is like to be cold and happy. Do we need a new term to describe something that’s not a disorder, but could still be described as our dark period? Kari Leibowitz, a health psychologist at Stanford University in California, says part of the problem is that our only framework for thinking about mental health at winter is clinical. She is fully accepting that some people do suffer from acute depression and need specialist help, but the rest of us need a different kind of narrative about the seasons. She calls it “a winter mindset”. In 2014, Leibowitz moved to the town of Trømso in Norway, which is north of the Arctic Circle and where for two months a year the sun never rises. Yet people in Trømso tend to thrive. Years later, this one research project has taken over Leibowitz’s life. “Yes, I suppose I am more in demand around now – I’m like the Mariah Carey of winter psychology,” she tells me. “I thought I’d write one article about it, put a little bow on it and then move on to other things. But now I’m writing a book on winter mindset and running workshops on how to cope with winter. It speaks to how entrenched our negative views of this season are, and how hungry people are for an alternative way to experience it.” The main difference between Trømso and the UK, she says, is that people here don’t prepare for winter. “It’s shocking to me that no workplace or even individual prepares for daylight saving ending. We should all be thinking about taking it a bit easier that week, giving us some space to sleep more and do less. Instead we get mad at ourselves for being more tired, rather than understanding that this is what it means to live in tune with the seasons.” Leibowitz says that although Covid made last winter more difficult, it can also provide some answers for making them more bearable. It may sound glib, but there have been recent mutterings of nostalgia for some of the more positive elements that came out of the first lockdown – bread baking, close community connections and the opportunity to explore hobbies. Leibowitz points out that winter can afford us those same opportunities. “People are nostalgic for that contemplation and slowness – winter is a powerful opportunity for that if we let it be. There are things that are nicer to do when the weather is bad: reading a book, using a hot oven to bake bread, taking time to write or practise music.” Rosenthal tells me about a recent study in Switzerland that says a half-hour walk in the mornings is helpful for those with Sad. “But I’m recommending it widely to all my patients. For those who are susceptible, I recommend another walk in the afternoon too, so you’re sort of mimicking the summer day.” He adds that is also important to be aware of carbohydrate cravings at this time of year, as they can “drive your eating patterns” and have an adverse effect on mental health. Covid also means that many of us are still working from home, at least some of the time, and while it might seem comfy and freeing to stay ensconced in our snoods all day (and even work from our beds), it’s probably not good for us. Getting dressed and taking a walk, regardless of the weather, can also provide a healthier framework. “The more we can make this a collective practice, something you share with your colleagues rather than hide from them, the better it is for everyone,” says Alex Soojung-Kim Pang, a four-day week advocate whose latest book is called Shorter: Work Better, Smarter, and Less. “Work used to be closely tied to the sun, tides and seasons – no more,” says Pang. “The world has trained us to overestimate how connected we need to be. For individuals, even setting aside a couple hours when we turn off email and notifications in favour of deep work can help us be more productive, without cutting us off from bosses or clients.” Leibowitz says walking in the cold is something to look forward to: “People underestimate how pleasurable it feels to go out in bad weather.” In Norway they (obviously) have a word for it, friluftsliv, which is a fondness for open-air living irrespective of season. She adds: “The air is cold but you’re warm and bundled up, you come home and feel invigorated and refreshed. I charge my students to go out on a wintry walk in the dark, and they all come back saying how surprised they were at how nice it was.” In the end, my 2020 New Year’s Eve was rescued. My bubble household – a couple who had been planning to spend the evening having a romantic dinner – invited me over at the last minute. We ate pasta and played board games, and when the clock struck midnight I was grateful not to be alone. The next couple of months were unbearable, but this winter doesn’t have to be the same. In October, as part of a grand scheme not to be ground down by gloom, I moved to New York – where I’m told the winter will be bitterly cold. But, for me at least, it will be more novel. I am looking forward to crisp morning runs, making soup while rewatching Succession, and reading all the books that I took on summer holiday but never got out of my backpack.
