2/12/2022,"The James Webb Space Telescope has finally captured its first image of a star — or rather, images. NASA has shared a mosaic of pictures (shown above) of a star taken using the primary mirror's 18 segments. It looks like a seemingly random collection of blurry dots, but that's precisely what the mission team was expecting. The imagery will help scientists finish the lengthy mirror alignment process using the telescope's Near Infrared Camera, or NIRCam. The first phase is nearly complete as of this writing. The visuals came from a 25-hour effort that pointed the James Webb Space Telescope to 156 different positions and produced 1,560 images with the NIRCam's sensors. The team created the mosaic using the signature of each mirror segment in a single frame. Visual artifacts come from using the infrared camera at temperatures well above the frigid conditions the telescope will need for scientific observation. And what you see here isn't the entirety of the mosaic — the full-resolution snapshot is over two gigapixels. NASA also provided a rare real-world glimpse at the JWST in action. The agency provided a ""selfie"" of the primary mirror (middle) created by a pupil imaging lens from the NIRCam. This too is blurry, but it offers a valuable look at the fully deployed mirror and helps explain the importance of alignment. Notice how just one segment is brightly lit by a star? It's the only one aligned with that celestial body — it will take a while before all segments are operating in concert. Researchers expect the first scientifically useful images from JWST in the summer. It's reasonable to presume those pictures will be considerably more exciting, especially as they start providing glimpses of the early universe. Still, what you see here demonstrates the telescope's health and suggests there won't be much trouble in the months ahead.",Science/Engadget,James Webb Space Telescope captures its first images of a star,https://news.yahoo.com/james-webb-space-telescope-first-star-image-165806746.html
2/12/2022,"A teenage boy was saved after falling through ice and into a pond in Ogden, Utah, on Wednesday, February 9, despite several police officers and sheriff’s deputies also falling in during the rescue operation. Body-camera footage released by Ogden Police shows officers responding to a call that two boys had fallen through the ice at the 21st Street Pond. On arrival at around noon on Wednesday, they found that one of the two males had managed to get out of the water on their own while the second was “still struggling,” police said. Two officers went out on the ice to reach the second victim but then fell into the water themselves, police said. The Weber County Sheriff’s Office (WCSO) arrived soon after to help, and said at least two of its deputies also ended up in the water. “After much effort, officers were able to rescue the victim from the ice. None of the officers or persons involved had significant injuries,” Ogden Police said. The WCSO lauded the work of the responders, paying a special mention to OPD Lieutenant Will Farr and WCSO Lieutenant Mark Horton. “Their training and quick response saved their lives. Great work, gentlemen!” the sheriff’s office said. Ogden Police said it was “grateful for the concerted effort of both law enforcement agencies” and grateful that no one sustained serious injuries. “We ask citizens to please be cautious around water where ice is present. In this season of ever-changing weather, it is uncertain as to the integrity of the ice,” they said.

2/12/2022,"Some of Mike Lindell’s closest allies alleging fraud in the 2020 election, including pro-Trump lawyer Lin Wood and former professor turned self-fashioned election expert David Clements, believe the MyPillow CEO has been duped. The infighting couldn’t come at a worse time for the pillow magnate as he continues to attempt to bring his complaint to the Supreme Court to quixotically attempt to overturn the 2020 election. Both Wood and Clements shared a Telegram posting Thursday night on their respective channels claiming that right-wing journalist Mary Fanning, an associate of Lindell’s and an individual who was a producer of his initial voter fraud documentary Absolute Proof, had a hand in subverting the pillow tycoon’s mission to overturn the 2020 election by being secretly aligned with Dominion Voting Systems. The Tragic Story of Mike Lindell’s Quack COVID ‘Cure’ Subsequently, Clements suggested “spooks” might have been “deployed to surround and infiltrate” the orbit of the pillow salesman, while Wood told his over half-million followers: “Like many, I believe Mike [Lindell] has been played at times by the enemy,” adding that “The enemy is the master of deceit and the deceiver of deceivers.” “The Deep State plays many games. But every game ends in time,” Wood further wrote alongside a picture of himself and Lindell. Reached for comment by The Daily Beast on Thursday night, Wood said Lindell has been a victim of “deception.” Lindell responded to the accusations by telling The Daily Beast that the duo’s claims are “all rubbish stuff.” He continued: “God uses evil for good, all things for good. God uses all things for good, whether they are evil, whether they’re not, or whether they’re good.” Read more at The Daily Beast. Got a tip?

2/12/2022,"""I don't want to see any other soldiers from any side have to be buried. I don't want to see any conflict in our Europe... And so I hope that by speaking today and starting that relationship that was at 0%, we can resolve a number of the issues that you've raised,"" Wallace said at the start of their meeting. Wallace laid a wreath at Moscow's Tomb of the Unknown Soldier situated at the Kremlin Wall in the Alexander Garden that holds the remains of the unknown soldiers killed in the Battle of Moscow in 1941. Russia has presented the West with a series of demands to guarantee its security, complaining it feels threatened by repeated waves of NATO enlargement and the refusal of the alliance to rule out membership for its neighbour Ukraine, a fellow former Soviet republic. Russia has more than 100,000 troops at the Ukrainian border, and the United States, Britain, the EU and NATO fear it may be planning an invasion. Moscow denies this but says it could take unspecified ""military-technical"" action unless demands are met, including barring Ukraine from ever joining the Western military alliance.",Politics/Reuters Videos,'I've buried too many soldiers' UK DefMin in Moscow,https://news.yahoo.com/ive-buried-too-many-soldiers-163535432.html
2/12/2022,"UPDATE, 2:29 PM PT: Closing arguments are scheduled for Friday in Sarah Palin’s libel case against The New York Times, after both sides rested their case. PREVIOUSLY: Sarah Palin completed her testimony in her libel case against The New York Times, as she told a New York federal court that the publication’s editorial linking her political action committee to a 2011 mass shooting “was mortifying.” More from Deadline Sarah Palin Takes Stand In Libel Trial Against New York Times; Former Editor Says He ""Felt Terrible"" For Inserting Incorrect Sentence In Op-Ed Unmasking Of Rudy Giuliani On Fox's 'The Masked Singer' Prompts Judges Ken Jeong & Robin Thicke To Walk Off In Protest Sarah Palin Tests Positive For Covid, Delaying Start Of Trial In Her Libel Suit Against New York Times --- Update The Times’ attorneys, meanwhile, tried to show that Palin’s reputation didn’t suffer from the editorial, which was corrected the day after it posted online. Among other things, they brought up Palin’s ability to still land speaking engagements before groups like Turning Point USA, media appearances on Fox News and a 2020 guest shot on Fox’s The Masked Singer. “It was devastating to read again a false accusation that I had anything to do with murder, murdering innocent people,” Palin said of the editorial. “I felt powerless. I knew I was up against Goliath and collectively the people were David, and I was David.” She said that she was up against those “who buy ink by the barrel and I had my number two pencil on my kitchen table in Alaska.” Palin said that in the wake of the piece, “the death threats really amped up,” and she “feared for my family’s safety and my supporters’ safety because of those threats.” Palin sued the Times in 2017 over the piece, which she said falsely linked her political rhetoric to the 2011 Tucson shootings in which six people were killed and congresswoman Gabby Giffords was severely wounded. The Times issued a correction and revised the editorial the day after it posted online. The Times also conceded that it had incorrectly characterized a map from Palin’s political action committee that featured crosshairs over certain Democrats’ electoral districts, including Giffords’. Palin said that she did not ask for the corrections or an apology. She said that she did find the Times’ corrections insufficient, as they did not mention her by name or identify her PAC. Asked whether she suffered any physical or emotional impact from the Times piece, Palin said, “Yes. It is hard to lay your head on a pillow and have a restful night when you know that lies are told about you, a specific lie that is not going to be fixed. That caused some stress anyone would feel. Yes, tough to get a good night sleep.” Under cross examination, Palin said that she did not consult a medical professional or therapist, but relied on a “holistic” approach, like running and hot yoga. The Times editorial, titled headlined America’s Lethal Politics, was published on the evening June 14. Earlier that day, James Hodgkinson opened fire on several Republican members of Congress who had been engaging in practice for a softball game, seriously wounding Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA). The original version of the editorial read, “Was this attack evidence of how vicious American politics has become? Probably. In 2011, when Jared Lee Loughner opened fire in a supermarket parking lot, grievously wounding Representative Gabby Giffords and killing six people, including a 9-year-old girl, the link to political incitement was clear. Before the shooting, Sarah Palin’s political action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized crosshairs.” In fact, no link was ever established between Loughner and the Palin PAC map, and there was evidence that he became focused on Giffords in 2007. In the days after the 2011 shootings, there was media attention on the Palin PAC’s map, which featured crosshairs over members’ districts, not the members themselves. In their cross examination, the Times’ legal team highlighted Palin’s rhetoric a year earlier, in 2010, after her PAC’s map was published to much criticism from Giffords another other Democrats. “Don’t retreat, Instead — RELOAD!” Palin wrote on Twitter. Palin told the court that the term is “a word I have been using all my life.” Asked by a Times attorney whether people “shied away” from her after the Times publication of the 2017 editorial, Palin could not name friends or politicians who shunned her. But she said that “based on all the comments I received … a lot of people did think lesser” of me. She has continued to get work. Palin said that her Masked Singer appearance, in which she revealed herself from a bear costume, “was the most fun 90 seconds of my life.” Asked about her payment for the gig, she said, “I will say it was good money.” Palin, though, is not seeking to recover lost income. James Bennet, who was opinion editor of the Times in 2017, testified earlier this week that he was responsible for inserting the incorrect language about Palin, and that he was “alarmed” that people were reading it to mean that she incited violence. Rather, he said that he meant the word “incitement” to have a broader context of harsh political rhetoric. He has maintained that it was a mistake and not part of an effort to malign Palin.
