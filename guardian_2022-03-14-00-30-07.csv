3/14/2022,"The defence manufacturer Sheffield Forgemasters, which was nationalised last summer, has been told by the UK government to terminate an energy contract with the Russian state-owned company Gazprom. The South Yorkshire steelmaker, owned by the Ministry of Defence but largely run independently, is a key supplier for the Trident submarine fleet. It has been told to ditch a deal with Gazprom’s UK arm, in news that was first reported by the Sunday Telegraph. While Sheffield Forgemasters has its own board that has yet to decide on the Gazprom contract, it is understood that the MoD has made clear to the company that ministers expect the arrangement to be terminated. The company’s chief finance officer, Steve Hammell, said: “We can confirm that Sheffield Forgemasters has ceased all product supply into Russia and as global energy markets react to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the board is reviewing its energy supply as a matter of urgency.” The firm declined to comment any further. Terminating the Gazprom contract would force the steelmaker to find a new supplier at a time when wholesale gas prices are soaring, and potentially pay penalty fees for an early exit from its contract. Sheffield Forgemasters, one of Britain’s oldest companies, became a Gazprom customer when the Russian business entered the UK market with the purchase of the Cheshire firm Pennine Natural Gas in the summer of 2006. In 2013, Sheffield Forgemasters revealed that it had secured a flexible contract with Gazprom that allowed it to buy gas years in advance at low prices. The news came as the UK chancellor, Rishi Sunak, called on UK firms to stop investing in Russia. He welcomed the decisions made by some companies, such as the energy firms BP and Shell, along with the investment firms Aviva, M&G and Vanguard, to divest away from Russian assets, and urged others to consider doing the same. A growing number of major international companies – including McDonald’s, Coca-Cola, Ikea and Uniqlo – are pulling out of Russia, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine more than two weeks ago. The MoD spent £2.6bn on the Sheffield Forgemasters acquisition last July, and pledged to invest as much as £400m over the next decade to replace critical equipment and infrastructure required for its military production capacity. The government has not announced sanctions on Russian gas companies yet, but has said it is “exploring options” to end Britain’s reliance on Russian gas.",News/Business,Defence firm Sheffield Forgemasters told to end contract with Gazprom,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/13/sheffield-forgemasters-ends-contract-with-gazprom-russia
3/14/2022,"In a week laced with drama and turmoil off the pitch, Chelsea were able to do what they needed to in their pursuit of Arsenal, thanks to a 92nd-minute goal from the talismanic Sam Kerr. The result meant the gap between Emma Hayes’s side and the league leaders narrowed to two points before Arsenal played on Sunday evening against Brighton. The hosts were without key players – Fran Kirby, Melanie Leupolz, Pernille Harder, to name a few – as a result of injury and illness, and it meant they had to dig out a hard-fought victory in the dying moments of the game to secure a crucial three points in the title race. Villa, who are winless and goalless since the international break, faced more misery at Kingsmeadow, in the face of a rotated and yet still powerful attack, led by Kerr and Guro Reiten. The pair linked up seamlessly from the Chelsea left; Reiten had a deflected shot caught by Hannah Hampton and then moments later delivered a cross that Kerr could only head straight into the hands of the keeper. The response from Villa was to enforce a hard press in midfield, shifting from a 4-3-3 to a defensive 4-5-1, cutting out spaces for Chelsea to counter into – and doing a great job of it for most of the first half. Hayes looked to ramp up the pressure in the Villa box, bringing on Sophie Ingle for Drew Spence at the break then Erin Cuthbert for Ji So-yun and Jessie Fleming for Beth England in the 66th minute – changes that emphasised the need for a faster, more effective attack. With the changes came a renewed charge; Hampton parried a shot into the path of an incoming Reiten and her effort trickled wide by inches, as did Ingle’s volley seconds later. With each shot at Hampton’s goal, the absence of Kirby and Harder became more apparent, and a goal from Kerr ruled offside in the 82nd minute did nothing to dampen the frustrations seeping into the Kingsmeadow air. Yet when things seemed as if they were petering out, it was Kerr again who shook off her earlier frustrations and took a shot to which this time neither Hampton nor the referee, Abigail Byrne, had an answer. Zecira Musovic in Chelsea’s goal took a long clearance towards the Villa penalty area and the Australian thumped the ball in, snuffing out both Arsenal’s and Aston Villa’s hopes for the game with one, reactive shot at goal. With three points in the bag for the hosts, all eyes now turn to Jonas Eidevall’s league leaders later this evening. Chelsea, meanwhile, travel to Everton on Wednesday evening in yet another quick turnaround in fixtures.",Sport/Football,Chelsea’s Sam Kerr breaks Aston Villa at the last to boost WSL title tilt,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/13/chelsea-aston-villa-womens-super-league-match-report
3/14/2022,"To mark the 150th anniversary of the birth of Ralph Vaughan Williams, the BBC Symphony Orchestra (BBCSO) and Martyn Brabbins turned to Vaughan Williams’s score for Charles Frend’s 1948 film, Scott of the Antarctic, about the ill-fated British expedition to the south pole in 1910-12, performed as live accompaniment to a beautifully restored print of the film itself. The score is one of the greatest ever written for cinema, and also one of the most familiar: Vaughan Williams reused much of it in his Sinfonia Antartica of 1952, an equally remarkable work, albeit at times different in tone from its source. Sections of the film have dated a bit. In particular, the opening sequences detailing preparations for the expedition and briefly sketching the lives that Scott (John Mills) and his men are leaving behind, now strike us as overly studio-bound and at times awkwardly acted. Music is used sparingly here, but when we reach the main part of the film, much of it shot on location in Norway and Switzerland, the fusion of sound and image can become overpowering with the score played live. Shifting chords, brittle percussion and the icy sound of a wordless female chorus and soprano soloist reflect the eerie polar landscape, sometimes beautiful, ultimately pitiless, across which we watch the men struggle as the unforgettable theme that represents their desperate courage surges round them. Sudden plunges into silence are integral to the overall impact, as are the moments when the sound of the blizzard that consumes lives gradually obliterates dialogue, singers and orchestra. Vaughan Williams was perhaps equivocal about the ending, in which memorials are erected and a lofty chorale rears nobly upwards – music that tellingly finds no part in the Symphony, which ends in a mood of crushing desolation and despair. The BBCSO played it all superbly for Brabbins, who was finely alert to every flicker of colour in Vaughan Williams’s often astonishing orchestration. The singers are more prominent in the film than the symphony: Elizabeth Watts was the soprano soloist, her voice hovering, disembodied and wraithlike, over the sinister, echoing ululations of the women’s voices of the BBC Symphony Chorus. Incredibly powerful and at times extraordinarily moving.",Arts/Music,BBCSO/Brabbins: Scott of the Antarctic review – astonishing orchestration is superbly played,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/13/bbcso-brabbins-scott-of-the-antarctic-review-astonishing-orchestration-is-superbly-played
3/14/2022,"Since the Black Lives Matter summer of 2020, there has been a tsunami of books, documentaries and commentary on racism. But the problem with the deluge of content (to use the modern lingo) is that it inevitably means a lack of quality and focus. If someone had nothing to add to our understanding of racism before the death of George Floyd, there is likely a good reason. Philosopher Lewis Gordon, long one of the most prominent scholars of racism, tries to enrich our knowledge with his unique brand of intellectual precision and analysis. Fear of Black Consciousness is in the tradition of his fellow Jamaican-born intellectual, the late Stuart Hall, who pioneered engaging with popular culture to understand the world. Using his own experiences and a tour through films and music, Gordon offers an explanation of why Black protest is such a dangerous prospect to the white power structure. Gordon reminds us that Black bodies have never been a problem. The reason there are so many of us in the west is because we were used as beasts of burden to build the modern world. But the idea that those bodies had minds and were fully human has sparked terror ever since we were shackled to ships. The enslaved were not permitted to read, write or to think, for fear that they would rise up and overthrow their so-called masters. Gordon explains that the same relationship to blackness exists today, when the Black body is fetishised but only if the mind is subdued. The obsession with the Black athlete or tanning beds, lip-fillers and Brazilian butt-lifts makes sense once we understand that it is only the body that is wanted. His use of Get Out!, Jordan Peele’s film about white people snatching African Americans, is the perfect avenue for this discussion. Following in a long Black intellectual tradition, Gordon distinguishes between lowercase black consciousness – recognising that you are a victim of racism – and uppercase Black consciousness, in which you are committed to fighting oppression. For anyone still questioning whether the US can be racist because of the election of Obama, Gordon explains that having a Black body is not the ultimate barrier to the presidency. The fear lay in electing a Black body with a Black consciousness. Once Obama demonstrated he posed no danger to whiteness, his body became an empty symbol of progress. Gordon uses this to offer a warning that “neoliberal racism doesn’t at first appear racist” because of the number of “people of colour” supposedly defending individual rights while enacting racist policies around migration, policing and removal of welfare protections. If ever a nation needed that reminder it is Britain, with the most diverse government in history pursuing the most racist social policy agenda in a generation. Gordon supplies an excellent critique of anti-Black societies, and puts the killing of George Floyd in context by explaining that the “police are structurally agents of social asphyxiation”, choking off resistance. He counters the backlash – from reactionary governments and rightwing alarmists – against the term “white privilege” by proposing “white licence” as a better way to capture how whiteness is a permit to be “above ethics, morality law and politics”. From lynchings to the recent attack on the US Capitol, we can see how this licence works. He does fail to explain, though, that uppercase Black consciousness is not solely defined in response to white racism. Blackness is more than a commitment to anti-racism; the colour of our skin is meant to link us back to Africa and is a political statement that we are a collective. It is not simply about struggling against whiteness. By only seeing Blackness as a by product of racism, Gordon theorises himself down the rabbit hole of defending (or at least explaining) Rachel Dolezal’s (the US activist who was, and still is, pretending to be African American) blackface as a genuine commitment to so-called transracial overcoming. Gordon also offers the movie Black Panther as an example of Black consciousness, which is an interesting choice because the movie is a case study of the kind of political identity we don’t need. An African kingdom that could have ended slavery, colonialism and the current plight of the continent but decided to sit it out to protect itself. When Wakanda finally does engage with the world, it does so with the help of the CIA and the UN, two of the best representatives of modern-day African oppression. None of this should be a surprise given that Black Panther was created by two white authors and the comics have a history of grotesque racist depictions (Gordon even acknowledges that M’Baku’s character seemed apelike because he got his powers from killing, eating and bathing in the blood of a gorilla). Fear of Black Consciousness provides an important critique and a powerful message to embrace Black consciousness. But the politics we need won’t be found on the big movie screens; it exists in the centuries of struggle that have produced the current moment.

3/14/2022,"It has taken Kojey Radical almost a decade to release his debut album. His EPs, including 2019’s Cashmere Tears, have proved the east London’s musician’s ability to take on heady subjects such as depression and God. His socially minded, genre-warping approach has made him an unpredictable maverick in British hip-hop, known for his experimentation – perhaps due to his start in fashion and spoken-word. Still, for someone who prefers the title of artist over rapper, he sure does spit with the bloodthirstiness of someone trying to out-bar his peers. Payback, which features an effortlessly sharp verse from rapper Knucks, feels like a winner’s anthem. “Dark on both sides. The dress code black,” he brags about his Blackness with the same pride as he raps about riches. “I made a mill before lunch,” he boasts on Pressure. The softer moments are some of this album’s best. Born’s dancehall beat shimmers, while Silk, featuring Masego’s syrupy vocals, is nothing short of intoxicating. “I feel like silk. Smooth. Sexy. Handsome”: a pep talk for Black men to croon in the mirror.

3/14/2022,"Brent Renaud, an award-winning US film-maker whose work has appeared in the New York Times and other outlets, has been killed by Russian forces in the flashpoint town of Irpin, outside Kyiv. A US photographer, Juan Arredondo, was wounded. Renaud, 51, was hit in the neck and died after coming under Russian fire while working on Sunday, according to local police officials and multiple Ukrainian sources. Jane Ferguson, a reporter for PBS Newshour who was nearby when Renaud was killed, tweeted: “Just left roadside spot near Irpin where body of American journalist Brent Renaud lay under a blanket. Ukrainian medics could do nothing to help him by that stage. Outraged Ukrainian police officer: ‘Tell America, tell the world, what they did to a journalist.’” Just left roadside spot near Irpin where body of American journalist Brent Renaud lay under a blanket. Ukranian medics could do nothing to help him by that stage. Outraged Ukranian police officer: “Tell America, tell the world, what they did to a journalist.” Clifford Levy, a deputy managing editor of the New York Times, issued a statement on Twitter clarifying that Renaud was not on assignment for the paper, contrary to earlier reports. “[The New York Times] is deeply saddened to learn of the death of an American journalist in Ukraine, Brent Renaud. Brent was a talented photographer and film-maker, but he was not on assignment for the New York Times in Ukraine. Early reports that he worked for Times circulated because he was wearing a Times press badge he had been issued for an assignment many years ago.” Levy added: “Brent’s death is a terrible loss. Brave journalists like Brent take tremendous risks to bear witness and to tell the world about the devastation and suffering caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.” The Kyiv region police chief, Andrei Nebitov, said in a statement: “The occupiers are cynically killing even journalists of international media who are trying to show the truth about the atrocities of Russian troops in Ukraine.” Arredondo, 45, a World Press Photo winner and adjunct professor at Columbia University, said he and Renaud had gone to Irpin to film refugees escaping the town, and they were fired on by forces near a checkpoint. Filmed describing what had occurred while he was receiving hospital treatment, he suggested they had driven into an ambush. “We crossed the first bridge in Irpin. We were going to film all the refugees leaving. We got into a car … someone offered to take us to the other bridge and we crossed a checkpoint and they started shooting at us,” Arredondo said. “So the driver turned around, and they kept shooting … and there was two of us. My friend is Brent Renaud and he’s been shot and left behind.” When the interviewer asked how Renaud was, Arredondo replied: “I don’t know. I saw he’d been shot in the neck. And we got split.” The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told CNN: “If in fact an American journalist was killed, it is a shocking and horrifying event. It is one more example of the brutality of Vladimir Putin and his forces as they’ve targeted schools and mosques and hospitals and journalists. “And it is why we are working so hard to impose severe consequences on him, and to try to help the Ukrainians with every form of military assistance we can muster, to be able to push back against the onslaught of these Russian forces.”",News/World news,US film-maker Brent Renaud killed by Russian forces in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/13/brent-renaud-us-film-maker-killed-by-russian-forces-ukraine
3/14/2022,"A Ukrainian woman has been joyfully reunited with two of her children after her husband rescued them from a war zone, where they had been sheltering in a cellar. Tetiana Hil, 36, said it was the worst day of her life when she had to leave her children Maksym, 17, and Alina, 10, in Ukraine so she could work in the UK to pay for the lifesaving heart surgery Maksym needed. He had had heart problems from birth and it was his third surgery. Her relationship with the children’s biological father had broken down and the couple had divorced. While working in the UK she met and then married Adil Arslan, 43, a British citizen, and the couple tried to bring Maksym and Alina to the UK to join the couple’s three-year-old daughter, Stefani. The children were cared for in Ukraine by Hil’s parents, Mykhailo Kulchytski and Stefaniia Kulchytska, in the village of Teklivka, about 25 miles (40km) from Ternopil in western Ukraine. But the Home Office refused permission for the children to come over. Officials wrote a letter to Alina, who does not speak English, on 1 November last year, saying: “To demonstrate that you are related to your sponsor (mother) as claimed you have submitted your birth certificate. Please provide additional evidence to show that you are related to your sponsor as claimed.” She was also asked to send officials a description of what involvement her biological father had with her life. The family say there has been no contact since 2016. After the Home Office’s refusal, an appeal was lodged by the family’s solicitors, which was due to be heard on 22 March. In the refusal letter, government officials wrote that Hil had not demonstrated satisfactorily that she had sole responsibility for her children, and that there were no “exceptional circumstances in the appellants’ cases that would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for refusing the applications”. Despite the Home Office’s refusal to grant the children’s visa, Arslan said he was determined to rescue the children as soon as Russia invaded Ukraine. “Tetiana was crying day and night about the danger the children were in in Ukraine. She couldn’t go herself as she has to look after three-year-old Stefani so I said I would go and get them,” he said. After a 20-hour drive he arrived at Poland’s border with Ukraine and collected everyone. He took the family to the visa processing centre in Brussels and after a few days officials agreed to overturn the visa application refusal for the two children. Arslan drove back and forth between Calais and Brussels to complete the process , and finally was able to reunite the two children with their mother in the early hours of Friday morning. But the children’s grandparents’ visa had not come through. That morning, after snatching a few hours sleep in the UK, Arslan drove back to Brussels to collect his in-laws after the visas were finally issued. He said his marathon journey of about 3,000 miles (4,800km) in five days was worth it “to see the smiles on everyone’s faces”. “We are happy, happy, happy now,” said Hil, who moved to the UK in 2018. “At last our family can be together and safe from this terrible war in my country. The children say the sky is different here from the sky in Ukraine because there are no bombs falling out of it. “I am so upset that the Home Office did not allow my children to come and join us before the war started. We did everything right with the application and sent a lot of documents. If they had granted permission when we applied for it my children could have avoided the war and would not have had to witness the shelling and the sirens. “They spent a lot of the time after the war started hiding in the cellar with my parents where we store the potatoes and carrots we grow. There is not much air down there but the children were frightened to go outside.” A government spokesperson said they would not comment on the case, but said: “We are standing shoulder to shoulder with Ukrainians which is why we’ve made it easier for those with Ukrainian passports to come here.”",News/World news,Ukrainian woman in UK reunited with children after husband rescues them from war zone,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/13/ukrainian-woman-uk-tetiana-hil-reunited-children-husband-rescues-russia-ukraine-war
