4/4/2022,"Ukrainian forces have claimed to have downed a Russian jet worth £38million as they continue to defend their country from Vladimir Putin's invasion. Images released by Ukrainian Armed Forces on Sunday showed the burning remains of an Su-35 fighter shot down near the city of Izyum, in the Kharkiv region. It is believed to be the first Su-35 which the Ukrainian forces have shot down since Putin ordered his troops to invade on 24 February. Video of a Russian soldier reported to be the pilot was shared on social media, showing him kneeling near the burning wreckage, although this was unverified. Ukrainian MP Anton Gerashchenko claimed the pilot ejected from the aircraft as it was going down and was captured as he tried to flee. The Su-35 is a twin-engine supermaneuverable fighter jet, bought into the Russian service in 2014. The 22m meter long aircraft can reach a top speed of 2,400kmh (1,500mph), and carries a number of weapons including rockets, air-to-air missiles and air-to-surface missiles. Russia is believed to have suffered significant losses since the conflict began, including thousands of soldiers and huge numbers of equipment. Watch: Volodymyr Zelensky sends appeal to Grammys over war in Ukraine Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky sent a video message to the Grammys in which he urged musicians to 'tell our story' and not to remain silent over the war in Ukraine. Latest figures from local news in Ukraine have estimated over 18,000 troops have died, along with 143 planes, 644 tanks and thousands of other vehicles. While the figures cannot be independently verified, Western officials have pointed towards evidence of significant losses on the Russia side as they come up against stiff opposition. It was claimed over the weekend that two Russian soldiers died after eating pies laced with poison which Ukrainian citizens ""treated"" them with. The troops from the third Motor Rifle Division, are said to have died instantly after locals in Izium ""gifted"" them the pies. Another 28 soldiers have reportedly been rushed to hospital, and hundreds more are said to be suffering ""severe illness"" from poisoned food and drink given to them. Ukraine's Ministry of Defence Intelligence wrote on social media on Saturday: ""Ukrainians resist the occupiers by all available means. ""According to available information, local residents of the Izium district (Kharkiv region) 'treated' Russians from the third Motorized Rifle Division of the Russian Federation with poisoned pies. ""As a result, two occupiers died at once, another 28 were taken to the intensive care unit. Their current state is being clarified."" Putin has been accused of carrying out a genocide in Ukraine, after Ukraine's Ministry of Defence released images on Sunday showing what was left behind in the city of Bucha following a retreat of Russian forces.  Footage showed bodies left lying in the street, some with the hands tied behind their backs and shot in the head. Ukrainian authorities have claimed 410 civilians were killed in Bucha and Irpin, with mass graves being dug for the victims. Journalist who have visited the area since the Russians retreat have said there is ""clear evidence"" of war crimes being left behind, including that of torture and rape. Ukrainian Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russian forces of torturing and executing hundreds of people in a Facebook post after the bodies were discovered. “I want every mother of every Russian soldier to see the bodies of the killed people in Bucha, in Irpin, in Hostomel,” Zelensky said. “What did they do? Why were they killed?” “War crimes in Bucha and other cities during the Russian occupation will also be considered by the UN Security Council on Tuesday,” he added.",News/Yahoo News UK,Wreckage of £38m Russian fighter jet pictured burning in field,https://news.yahoo.com/wreckage-of-38-m-russian-fighter-jet-pictured-burning-in-field-090219348.html
4/4/2022,"Tribal and state officials are warning against harassment of spearfishers as the Indigenous harvest season starts in northern Wisconsin. “Tribal members have the right to hunt, fish and gather in the Ceded Territories,” said Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul in a statement. “Any attempt to interfere with those rights is illegal and should be reported to local law enforcement and Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission.” Preston D. Cole, secretary for the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, also released a statement. “The department has zero tolerance for harassment of tribal members who are exercising their treaty rights,” he said in a statement. “We fully support Ojibwe sovereignty and treaty rights.” Officials with the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission are urging tribal citizens to remember and practice the four C’s should they encounter any harassment. Those are to create distance, confirm their location, call 911 and check in with GLIFWC. RELATED: Tribal spearfishers continue practice for food sovereignty, culture despite claims of harassment in northern Wisconsin RELATED: Wisconsin Ojibwe tribal citizens say they were harassed while spearfishing in Minnesota Tribal officials said incidents of harassment of spearfishers occur every season, yet many go unreported. Last year, a Lac du Flambeau Ojibwe family reported they were harassed while spearfishing on Mille Lacs Lake in the Ceded Territory in Minnesota. Melvin Buckholtz told police he and his family, which included his 13-year-old son, were confronted by a group of people on shore who were yelling profanities, throwing rocks at them and threatening gun violence. Last month, charges were brought against Colin James Louvar, 23, in connection with the incident. The charges include felony harassment with aggravated violations for screaming racially-charged profanities at Buckholtz’s family. In 2020, Greg (Biskakone) Johnson, a Lac du Flambeau Ojibwe citizen, reported gunfire in his direction after a confrontation with a man on shore while he and a group of others were spearfishing in northern Wisconsin. James Kelsey, 62, pleaded no contest to using a gun while intoxicated and served no jail time, but was instead ordered by a Vilas County judge to pay a $343.50 fine earlier this year, to the ire and frustration of tribal citizens and their supporters. Vilas County District Attorney Martha Milanowski said hate crime and use of a dangerous weapon charge modifiers were dropped because Kelsey pleaded no contest to possessing a firearm while intoxicated and interfering with tribal fishing rights, which is a DNR ordinance violation. The rights for Ojibwe people to hunt and fish off-reservation in what is known as the Ceded Territory, which includes much of the Wisconsin Northwoods, are guaranteed by U.S. and tribal law through early to mid-19th century treaties in exchange for the government taking Ojibwe land. Those opposed to spearfishing argue it harms the fish populations, but state officials say that’s not true. The DNR sets safe harvest amounts for each lake so there is less than a 1-in-40 chance that more than 35% of the adult walleye population will be harvested by tribal and recreational fishermen combined. “Some people say an extra harvest is given to tribal members, which is not true,” said Todd Ambs, former assistant deputy secretary of the DNR, adding that there about 500 tribal spearers compared with about 2 million licensed anglers in the state. “Other (non-tribal) anglers have harvested substantially more.” Since 1989, the total tribal harvest of walleye in the Ceded Territory averaged about 28,000 per year, according to a joint tribal, state and federal report. Tribal fisheries on reservations more than replenish those numbers every year. These hatcheries produced more than 15 million walleye eggs in 2018, of which more than 121,000 reached to extended growth fingerlings and were released into Northwoods lakes.

Anyone violating tribal rights could be charged under several Wisconsin laws, fined up to $10,000 and sentenced up to nine months in prison, according to the Department of Justice. Additionally, any tribal member whose rights are violated may bring civil action for damages and seek a restraining order. “The spring treaty fishing season is among the most highly regulated, highly enforced harvest activities in the region,” McGeshick said in a statement. “Overall, GLIFWC’s Conservation Law Enforcement Division maintains excellent working relationships with law enforcement agencies throughout the Ceded Territories. Together, we hope to help create an atmosphere where tribal members can fish, hunt, and gather without worry or apprehension.” Frank Vaisvilas is a Report For America corps member based at the Green Bay Press-Gazette covering Native American issues in Wisconsin.

4/4/2022,"Some conscripts to the Russian war effort from the Donbas region are being handed antiquated rifles designed in the late nineteenth century, forced to drink from ponds littered with dead frogs, turning on their commanders and refusing to fight on. One student draftee who was given an automatic weapon said he had received no instructions on how to fire it. The student, speaking to Reuters, said he was ordered to repel an attack by Ukrainian forces, but told a reporter: “I don’t even know how to fire an automatic weapon.” ‘It’s a Sh*tshow’: Russian Troops Are Now Turning on Each Other The student said he was put in a mortar unit but was “taught nothing…Up to that point I had only seen mortars in movies. Obviously, I didn’t know how to do anything with them.” The wife of another untrained Donbas draftee told Reuters: “He doesn’t even really know how to hold an automatic weapon.” The report follows dozens of Western intelligence briefings and information shared by Ukrainians officials, which suggest that morale within the Russian forces is at breaking point and supply lines are a disaster. Last week, a Russian soldier was caught on tape lamenting the huge losses they were taking and complaining that the army was full of “morons.” “Our brigade has totally shit themselves. There are losses, many wounded,” he told his wife. “It’s unclear why we are even here,” he said. Ukraine has made advances in dozens of regions where Russian forces made initial inroads, revealing the true scale of the horror perpetrated in President Putin’s name. Reuters said that it spoke to six people for the report. In addition to the student it spoke to “three wives of conscripts who have mobile phone contact with their partners, one acquaintance of a draftee, and one source close to the pro-Russian separatist leadership who is helping to organize supplies for the Donbas armed forces.” Draftees from the separatist Donbas region are not part of the Russian army but are fighting alongside them. The overall picture that emerges from the report is of untrained and expendable conscripts providing ineffective support to their Russian counterparts. Reuters says Donbas conscripts “were given the highly dangerous mission of drawing enemy fire onto themselves so other units could identify the Ukrainian positions and bomb them.” The claim tallies with a video published by Ukraine on March 12 in which a prisoner of war, who said he was an untrained civil servant from Donbas, said he was ordered to draw enemy fire in Mariupol to give away Ukrainian positions. Reuters said that “several” of the draftees have been armed with bolt action Mosin rifles, which were first produced in the 1880s by the Russian Empire, and were the workhorse firearm of the Russian army for decades. Production ceased after the Second World War, however large stockpiles of the weapon survive. They were last actively manufactured, in small numbers, by Finland in 1973. Horrific New Details of Carnage in Ukraine Town Emerge The student conscript said: “It’s like we’re fighting with World War Two muskets,” adding, “I hate the war. I don’t want it, curse it. Why are they sending me into a slaughterhouse?” In another episode which clearly illustrates weak morale, Reuters says a group of some 135 Donbas conscripts in Mariupol mutinied by putting down their weapons and refusing to continue to fight. The men were kept in a basement by their commanders before being subsequently released. The report also highlights the widely reported supply line issues affecting the Russian war effort, with three sources saying draftees had to drink untreated water and scavenge for food. “We drank water with dead frogs in it,” the student said while a source described as being “close to the Donetsk separatist leadership” told Reuters: “Supplies for the soldiers right now are a disaster.” The Kremlin told Reuters that the issues raised were for the leadership of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) to answer. The DNR did not comment. Read more at The Daily Beast. Get the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox. Sign up now.

Why it matters: Now as people slowly return to the office, there's confusion. Many grew accustomed to elastic waistbands; we haven't buttoned or zipped pants in a while. There are big questions: Are sweatpants OK in an office? What if they're called joggers? My editor (a queen, obviously) said I can wear whatever to the Axios office. But there are other managers who are confused, reports the WSJ. Dress codes are now ""the elephant in the room in every workplace right now,"" one told the paper. State of play: The time apart from the strictures of the office gave people the freedom to realize they didn't need to stuff themselves into a pair of tight shoes to do their jobs, accelerating a yearslong trend toward more casual office wear. ""Dressing however we wanted revealed there weren't any downstream costs to relaxing our idea of professional attire,"" said Erica Bailey, a Ph.D. candidate at Columbia Business School and co-author of a paper on pandemic business attire. What's next: Everything is up in the air right now, but Bailey said letting workers figure out what's appropriate makes them feel more authentic and in turn more engaged at work.

4/4/2022,"STORY: In the town of Bucha, 37 km (23 miles) northwest of Kyiv's city center, Reuters reporters saw a man lay sprawled by the roadside, his hands tied behind his back and a bullet wound to his head. Bucha's deputy mayor, Taras Shapravskyi, said 50 of some 300 bodies found after Russian forces withdrew from the city late last week, were the victims of extra-judicial killings carried out by Russian troops. Reuters could not independently verify those figures or who was responsible for the killings. Russia's defence ministry said in a statement issued on Sunday (April 3) that all photographs and videos published by the Ukrainian authorities alleging ""crimes"" by Russian troops in Bucha were a ""provocation,"" and no resident of Bucha suffered violence at the hands of Russian troops. Ukraine's foreign minister called on the International Criminal Court to collect evidence of what he called Russian war crimes.
