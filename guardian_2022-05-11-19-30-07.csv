5/11/2022,"Stephen Sondheim’s 1994 musical is about that most intimate thing: romantic love. It feels all the more appropriate, then, for it to be staged on the up-close-and-personal stage of the Hope Mill. At any one time, Dean John-Wilson’s Giorgio is either stationed in a provincial town with Ruthie Henshall’s Fosca or on leave in Milan with Kelly Price’s Clara. But when these love rivals sing at once, they are so close at hand they seem to claim his attention physically as well as emotionally. You can see why he can’t get them out of his head. When an all-male chorus of soldiers strike up under the musical direction of Yshani Perinpanayagam, the force of their singing is thrilling. Yes, it seems eccentric of director Michael Strassen to play the opening scene so far forward only the front row can see it, but in those moments when the performers sing directly out to the audience, they make a special connection. Inspired by Ettore Scola’s movie Passione d’Amore and, in turn, Iginio Tarchetti’s 1869 novel Fosca, the musical, with its book by James Lapine, is set among a company of soldiers in 19th-century Italy. That gives it a flavour of Rostand’s Cyrano de Bergerac, the more so because Fosca, the colonel’s cousin, has a Cyrano-like love of literature and a belief in her own ugliness. Being unlucky in love, she also has a touch of Dickens’s Miss Havisham. In her prim white dress and hair in a bun, Henshall is all stiff gestures and manic glares, a woman too constrained by her own body to express the broiling emotions within. By contrast, Price is fluid and sensual, moving freely with her instincts. They give forceful performances, even if the male-centric musical caricatures them as women helplessly governed by their own wayward natures. It argues that Giorgio’s fractious relationship with Fosca is ultimately more rewarding than his carefree affair with the married Clara. That is a sophisticated idea for a Broadway show, but in making the point, it pushes Fosca to hysterical extremes and makes Clara seem shallow. Caught in the middle, Giorgio can do no wrong. Melodrama aside, the singing is excellent and the off-stage band bright and strident, creating a suitably impassioned show.

5/11/2022,"There are several possible reactions to the news that the newly launched talkTV registered zero viewers during primetime broadcasts. One is to politely note that a new television station – especially one competing in an already saturated market – will take a little time to find its identity. Another is to realise that life is far too short and precious to spend your evenings watching Piers Morgan whip himself into a wet dribble of performative outrage over something he only slightly believes in. Both reactions are valid. I prefer the latter. What’s fascinating about talkTV’s failure to set the world on fire is how blase Morgan is about it. “Linear TV increasingly irrelevant to total eyeball potential for a global show like this, especially with younger viewers who don’t really watch TV any more,” he tweeted last week; a statement in stark contrast to the compulsive willy-waving competition he had with Dan Walker over Good Morning Britain’s ratings. But, and oh God this hurts, Morgan might have a point. It’s true that talkTV has had zero viewers – in truth, the term means that people might have watched it, but just not in enough numbers for the Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board (Barb) to register – but it’s far from alone. Last July, in the wake of one of its presenters taking a knee on air, GB News registered zero viewers too. A year before that, Steph McGovern’s lunchtime Channel 4 show did the same. In 2019, shows on the newly launched BBC Scotland recorded zero viewers, and in 2017 so did a repeat of Blue Peter. And these are just the zero-rated shows that have managed to Shawshank their way past Barb’s incomprehensibly tight clutches, leaked to the press by television insiders to prove some sort of point. In reality, there’s an enormous chance that we’re all swimming in a world of completely unwatched television. The medium is already on the decline. The UK analysis firm Digital TV Research this year predicted that 1.4m British households will bail on their pay TV subscriptions by 2027, possibly because we will have figured out that we’re paying through the nose to not watch 99% of what is on our TVs. Just dig through your EPG and you’ll see. Go all the way down to the bottom, like you do in hotel rooms when you’ve realised that you’ve left your Roku stick at home, and remember: we live in an age where streaming services let us instantly access all of the best television that has ever been made, giving near infinite choice of viewing options. Now, with that in mind, how many people are going to come home from another unsatisfying day at work and slump down in front of 30 Movie Monsters With Pat Sharp on Now 80s? How many people are going to gently kick their partner at 8.15pm, telling them to turn off Bridgerton because Joyce’s Ulcer, the third episode of the 1989 ITV sitcom Surgical Spirit, just started on Forces TV? And, sure, maybe some people would tune in for Sky Nature HD’s Dogs With Extraordinary Jobs, but my gut feeling is that they would all tune out again after 15 minutes, annoyed by the dogs boasting about their wonderful careers. And these shows don’t have the luxury of being heavily advertised by a powerful multinational media corporation, as talkTV does. My four-year-old has never seen a picture of Surgical Spirit on the side of a bus and told me that he wants to watch it, as he did with Piers Morgan Uncensored yesterday morning. It’s fine, by the way. I’ve sold him now. But if people aren’t watching talkTV, they also aren’t watching hundreds of other shows. We find ourselves in a landscape of televisual orphans, floating around in the ether, forgotten and unwatched. So, to reiterate, Morgan might have a point. People aren’t watching television, and his show certainly isn’t the least watched on television at the moment. But, having watched some of it on YouTube, I can tell you it is probably the most insufferable. Hope that helps.",Arts/Television & radio,Zero-rated?

5/11/2022,"Shireen Abu Akleh, the Al Jazeera correspondent who has been shot and killed in Jenin in the West Bank, was a veteran observer of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, renowned across the Arab world as an authoritative voice on the region’s most contested story. The 51-year-old joint Palestinian and US citizen had reported from nearly every flashpoint in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem over a three-decade career that saw her regularly criss cross between both sides telling the stories of Palestinians and Israelis from homes, battlegrounds and the drawing rooms of leaders. She covered the second intifada, the Israeli siege of Jenin in 2002, the death of Yasser Arafat, numerous West Bank raids and faltering attempts to find a sustainable peace between both sides. Abu Akleh was highly regarded throughout the region and was seen as one of the network’s pre-eminent talents, whose coverage faced the intense scrutiny of vested interests on both sides of the conflict since she made her on-screen debut in 1997. “Shireen is the face/voice of events in the Palestinian territory – probably everyone who follows news from there knows her,” said Tamara al-Rifai, the senior spokesperson for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). “It’s not possible to follow news from the West Bank and not have heard/seen reporting from Shireen. “She truly was a fixture of the Palestinian story and the fact that she has covered so many stormy events unscathed makes her death today even more shocking.” Muzna Shihabi, a longstanding friend, said: “Shireen is a resilient person who lost her parents at a very young age but she bounced back and got her journalism degree at a time where journalists in the Arab world were just followers of their governments. “She knew things were changing and she kept going on until she became the storyteller of the Palestine cause. She is a reference in the Arab world. Everyone in the street would stop and salute her for her courage and determination and unique way of telling the stories of Palestinians. Arabs cannot go to Palestine. Shireen took them there.” Abu Akleh’s colleagues claim she was killed by Israeli fire shortly after arriving at the scene of a raid near Jenin. Israel has contested the claim, suggesting Palestinan gunmen may have been responsible. The US ambassador to Israel, Tom Nides, said he was “very sad” to learn of Abu Akleh’s death. “I encourage a thorough investigation into the circumstances of her death and the injury of at least one other journalist today in Jenin,” he tweeted.",News/World news,Shireen Abu Akleh killing: ‘She was the voice of events in Palestine’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/11/shireen-abu-akleh-killing-al-jazeera-voice-events-palestine
5/11/2022,"Good morning. Ukraine’s government has suggested that Kyiv could expand its own war aims with an intensifying counteroffensive against the Russians, and said it would suspend the flow of Russian gas through its country to Europe. With the war now in its 11th week and Russia pounding the vital port of Odesa with missile strikes in an apparent effort to disrupt supply lines, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said late last night that the military was gradually pushing Russian troops away from the key city of Kharkiv and back towards the border with Russia. The Ukrainian military’s general staff said its forces drove the Russians out of four villages to the north-east of Kharkiv, a key city that has been under attack from the Russians since the beginning of the conflict. Meanwhile, trapped and wounded Azovstal soldiers are pleading for rescue. In what way might they expand? Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, seemed to indicate that the country could go beyond merely pushing Russia back to areas it or its allies held on the day of the 24 February invasion and mean “the liberation of the rest of our territories”. What else is happening? Here’s what we know on day 77 of the invasion. After the bombshell leak of a supreme court draft opinion last week revealed that the majority of justices plan to overturn Roe v Wade, a handful of states have been reaffirming and expanding their abortion care. In recent days, a flurry of bills and statements have been emerging in largely Democratic-run states as lawmakers and organizations scramble to prepare for the possibility of a post-Roe America. As some states seek to become “safe havens” for out-of-state abortion seekers, other states have been increasing abortion funding, expanding provider access and offering legal protections from lawsuits launched by citizen “bounty-hunters” against those involved in abortions. Only 38% of women of reproductive age live in states that have shown support for abortion rights, according to the research organization Guttmacher Institute. In contrast, 58% live in states that have demonstrated hostility towards abortion rights. Only 4% of women live in middle-ground states. Last month, the New York state senator Liz Krueger introduced a bill that would shield New York doctors who offer abortion services to out-of-state patients. Al Jazeera has accused Israel of deliberately killing one of its reporters during a firefight between Israeli security forces and Palestinian gunmen in the occupied West Bank town of Jenin. Shireen Abu Akleh, 51, a Palestinian American and one of the Arab world’s most well-known reporters who had covered the conflict for decades, was shot in the head this morning and taken to hospital in critical condition. She had been covering a military raid in a northern town and nearby refugee camp, a historical flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Abu Akleh was wearing a helmet and body armour clearly marked as “press”. The Qatar-based television network said her colleagues at the scene said the veteran reporter was shot by Israeli forces. In a statement, Al Jazeera called on the international community to hold Israeli forces accountable for their “intentional targeting and killing” of Abu Akleh. “In a blatant murder, violating international laws and norms, the Israeli occupation forces assassinated in cold blood Al Jazeera’s correspondent in Palestine,” it said. What has the Israeli military said? A statement said its troops had shot back after coming under “massive fire” in Jenin and that “there is a possibility, now being looked into, that reporters were hit – possibly by shots fired by Palestinian gunmen”. As president, Donald Trump repeatedly asked aides if China could be manufacturing hurricanes and sending them to damage the United States, three unnamed former senior officials told Rolling Stone. Trump also reportedly wanted to know if using such a “hurricane gun” would constitute an act of war. Survivors of the brutal regime of the late Philippines dictator Ferdinand Marcos have described his son’s apparent landslide presidential election victory as the product of trickery, warning that it is unlikely the billions stolen by his family will be recovered, and that human rights in the country will be weakened. The lifting of zero-Covid policies in China would see a “tsunami” of infections and almost 1.6 million deaths, a study claims, citing in part China’s low vaccination rate of elderly people. China’s government remains committed to a zero-Covid policy, enforcing lockdowns, strict quarantine and isolation. Vicky White spent 16 years developing a reputation as a model deputy in the sheriff’s office that operates the jail in Lauderdale county, Alabama, according to her boss. Authorities now say that makes it harder to come to grips with how she became the lover of a murder suspect incarcerated at her lockup. California’s drought is worsening yet new figures show that in March, water usage jumped nearly 19% compared with 2020, one of the driest months on record. The startling figures come despite pleas from the authorities who have urged residents to curb their water usage. They also come the same day that the Los Angeles mayor ordered residents and businesses to restrict outdoor watering to just two days a week in an effort to conserve. There is a phenomenon in recruiting that is baffling experts: while there are record level job openings in both the UK and in the US, why do many people still have to apply to sometimes hundreds of jobs, even in sought-after fields like software development, while many companies complain they can’t find the right talent? Some experts argue that algorithms and artificial intelligence now used extensively in hiring are playing a role. Idaho has long been one of the most conservative states in America with its fair share of extremism. Now, critics warn, the extremists are being normalised. Once dismissed as backwoods fanatics, the far right have entered the political arena and identified a path to power. That path leads through a state Republican party that has long exploited tensions between independent-spirited Idahoans and the federal government and more recently embraced Donald Trump’s culture of grievance. Vanuatu’s push for the international court of justice (ICJ) to protect vulnerable nations from climate change has received the backing of 1,500 civil society organisations from more than 130 countries, as it heads toward a crucial vote at the UN general assembly later this year. If it succeeds, the ICJ’s advisory opinion – although non-binding – carries legal weight and moral authority which experts say could help shape international law. A Canadian lawmaker has apologized after he was caught logging on to a parliamentary session from a toilet stall.

5/11/2022,"Professor Nabila Sadiq was only 38 when she died of Covid-19. Unable to find a hospital bed in her native India, which had been overwhelmed by the virulent new Delta variant, her heart-rending Twitter messages pleading for help were picked up around the world. The story clearly hit home with the Scottish public health expert Professor Devi Sridhar, who is around the age Sadiq was and whose family are of Indian heritage. As she writes poignantly in her new book: “She would have lived had she been in Scotland, like me”. Accidents of geography are arguably a key theme of Sridhar’s book, an ambitiously wide-ranging study of a global pandemic with the emphasis firmly on the global. As she points out, individuals’ fates were too often determined by where they happened to have been born: living through the pandemic in Vietnam or Kerala was not like living through it in Britain. The refreshing twist in her tale, however, is that often it was countries from whom we are not used to taking public health lessons that got it right while a complacent west messed up. Most people have heard of New Zealand’s zero-Covid experiment or Swedish resistance to lockdowns. But what about Senegal in west Africa, and the invaluable lessons it learned from an outbreak of Ebola? Should we have paid more attention to South Korea, an early adopter of living with Covid, which embraced social distancing and masks but sought to keep schools open and avoid full lockdown with a formidable (if very invasive) test-and-trace system? And before Delta, the Indian state of Kerala was arguably a model of coping with Covid in an impoverished population. Yet British experts, she writes, were “so used to telling poorer countries how to do global health that they completely forgot humility and to listen to what experts in those poorer countries were saying or doing”. Sridhar will be a trusted guide to many Guardian readers thanks to her regular pandemic columns, which so many of us faithfully consulted to work out how worried we should be whenever the virus took some new turn. After living under the shadow of the virus for so long, I thought I’d be happy never to read the word “Covid” again, but of all the accounts snapped up by publishers in lockdown hers was the one I was curious about. It is not a rip-roaring read, however. If you want something pacy and full of horror stories about Downing Street’s dysfunctional response to Covid then this isn’t the one (try Jeremy Farrar and Anjana Ahuja’s Spike instead). Sridhar’s account is heavy on the detail that scientists love but lay readers may occasionally find exhausting, and it could have done with a stronger narrative thread from which to hang its fascinating tales from around the globe. Since Sridhar advised Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, to whom she remains close, it would also have been good to explore Scotland’s experiment with trying to eliminate the virus in greater depth. She notes that in the summer of 2020 Scotland actually came within a whisker of getting cases down to zero, only to be foiled by a fresh wave imported by tourists. Sridhar hints that an independent Scotland – which would have been able to close its own borders and control its own furlough schemes, powers currently reserved for Westminster – might have enjoyed different outcomes. But given the political reality in 2020, was zero Covid ever a realistic aim if England wasn’t on board? It would have been fascinating to unpack all this in more detail. The book’s strength, however, is its resolutely unparochial and distinctively millennial’s eye view of the pandemic, keenly alert to all the inequalities and asymmetries of power exposed. In the end, wealth sadly became “the best shielding strategy not only from Covid-19 but from the response to it as well”, she writes, with rich countries gobbling up vaccine stocks at the expense of poor ones, and rich individuals weathering lockdown more comfortably than poor ones. Lessons must be learned, she argues, for future pandemics. But there is another lesson to be drawn from the first wave, when the west could arguably have saved itself much heartache by recognising that it wasn’t always money that talked. For Asian countries drawing on experience of previous coronaviruses, or African countries with fragile healthcare systems who recognised they couldn’t afford to be complacent, in the early days “competence not wealth” mattered. The moral of the story, perhaps, is never to assume the two automatically go together.

5/11/2022,"Welcome to The Spin, the Guardian’s weekly (and free) cricket newsletter. Here’s an extract from this week’s edition. To receive the full version every Wednesday, just pop your email in below. “The ICC and its members do not recognise privately owned tournaments or leagues in the men’s or women’s game. Any Twenty20 tournament that features the best players in the world outside ICC competitions would need to be run and controlled by one of the full members, as opposed to by a private operator.” That was the England and Wales Cricket Board’s view, as expressed by Clare Connor, in response to the radical idea of an independent women’s T20 league proposed by the Australian businessman Shaun Martyn in 2014. Eight years later, five England players are taking part in just such a private competition – the FairBreak Invitational, run by Martyn’s company FairBreak Global Ltd. The tournament started last week and is taking place in Dubai until 15 May, contested by six teams, and – uniquely – featuring players from 35 different nations (including Rwanda, Bhutan, and Vanuatu). A nice touch, epitomising the tournament’s distinctive philosophy, is that instead of numbers on the back of their shirts, players have their national flag. Five of them are sporting St George’s crosses – Sophie Ecclestone, Danni Wyatt, Sophia Dunkley, Tash Farrant and – significantly – the England captain, Heather Knight. Knight’s inclusion appears to signal the ultimate seal of approval from the ECB – a board that in 2014 banned its players from competing in such an endeavour. Somehow, in the eight years since Connor unequivocally rejected it, Martyn’s vision has gained official sanction from the ECB and International Cricket Council alike. It has not been straightforward. Since 2014, international players in almost all full member nations have been handed professional contracts; within two years of Martyn’s failed proposal, franchise tournaments owned by Cricket Australia (the Women’s Big Bash League) and the ECB (the Kia Super League) had sprung up, in what was partly a deliberate attempt to take the wind out of Martyn’s sails. “We spent a couple of years where the ICC would send us off to partner with a board, the board would send us back to get permission from the ICC, and that just became a bit of a revolving door,” Martyn tells the Spin. “So I backed off from doing that.” Instead, his vision shifted – becoming centred on the component that he felt was missing from those leagues: associate nation players. “The women’s side of the game is so diverse and so globally spread, that to think that the talent is only concentrated in a few major countries is not understanding the difference between the two games at all,” he says. “There’s great players in all countries.” Through 2018 and 2019, Martyn staged a series of charity matches involving a single FairBreak XI, made up of a mix of associate and full member players. Eventually he gained backing from Cricket Hong Kong, which paved the way for ICC endorsement and the current, fully fledged tournament. “I think the ICC understands now that we’re not trying to compete with anyone, we’re just trying to grow opportunity for all the players and coaches that we engage with,” Martyn says. He now has the support of all full-member boards, with the notable exception of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, which withdrew its players at the last minute, ostensibly due to a clash with a domestic tournament. Players such as Harmanpreet Kaur are, according to Martyn, “bitterly disappointed” to be missing out. Martyn believes the ICC’s vision for women’s cricket has up to now been limited by its inability to see beyond the existing landscape of men’s cricket. “It’s really important that assumptions are not made that because the blokes do it this way, everyone else should do it this way,” he says. “The audience for women’s cricket is quite different to the audience for men’s cricket. You can’t keep lumping them together, that diminishes the women’s game and it diminishes the opportunity for those women.” While men’s cricket is largely driven by an Indian fanbase, 142 countries are screening FairBreak. Here in England the entire tournament is being shown live on free-to-air (channel 64), courtesy of FreeSports. The other point of difference with FairBreak, says Martyn, is how much the tournament is player-led. “We spend a lot of time consulting with players. Most of the female players want to play differently to the men. They see what their tennis-playing and golf-playing counterparts do – they don’t like eight-week tournaments. With a two-week tournament, women are able to travel with their family,” he adds, pointing to the example of Pakistan’s Bismah Maroof, who has been able to travel to Dubai with her young baby, Fatima. Though Martyn does not say so – he wants, after all, to remain on its good side – the entire tournament might be viewed as rather embarrassing for the ICC, whose lack of vision for women’s cricket in associate nations has been exposed. A good example is the fact that the top-tier contracts in the tournament are worth US$20,000. For the associate players in receipt of these, it is a healthier contribution to their bank balance than anything the ICC has managed. On the other hand Martyn is oddly cagey about how, precisely, the FairBreak Invitational is actually being funded. “It’s coming from the companies and the organisations that support us, it’s come partly from work I’ve done,” he says. “Some broadcasters are paying us.” Pushed for more details, he laughs uncomfortably and replies: “I’m not going to divulge all our intellectual property around our finances. You’d have to sign an NDA for that!” Clearly, there remain question marks over whether the enterprise is financially sustainable over the longer term. Is there perhaps also something of a tension at the heart of FairBreak? Martyn insists the tournament is not in competition with existing franchise tournaments: “We’re not trying to compete with the Hundred, or the WBBL. This is a global tournament, it’s not a domestic tournament.” FairBreak has been marketed as a charitable endeavour, with the laudable developmental purpose of showcasing associate talent; it is this that has enabled Martyn to erode ICC opposition to the concept. Yet is this compatible with Martyn’s ultimate vision for FairBreak, which he wants to become “the biggest global competition that we have for women outside of a World Cup”? If he were to achieve that goal, he would be one of the most powerful men in cricket. The idea that he would be no threat to the ICC at that point seems naive at best. And with his ability to attract a genuinely global audience to FairBreak, it might already be too late to put the genie back in the bottle. Martyn says that even a week into the tournament, the levels of social media engagement and viewer numbers are “fairly incredible”. From this point “it’s going to be hard to deny that we’re a key part of the growth of the women’s game”. “We’re here, doing what we said we’d do. We’ll be doing this again next year, and we’ll grow it,” he adds.

5/11/2022,"The girl band is in crisis. As Little Mix go on their hiatus and tie up their Confetti tour, touted as their last shows “for now”, the UK finds itself without a major girl band for the first time in nearly 30 years. It is a bleak prospect, as girl bands have often acted as agitators in the UK’s male-dominated music scene. Spice Girls are the most obvious example of this, arriving in 1996 amid lad-heavy Britpop, but groups in their wake have similarly disrupted the status quo: Girls Aloud’s rambunctiousness cut through the mid-00s indie explosion; All Saints and Sugababes offered sophistication instead of bubblegum Europop; and Mis-Teeq brought bold sexuality to UK garage. But for every success story, there followed half a dozen failed attempts to capitalise on it. After the Spice Girls’ ascent the major label machine pumped out various groups, but, despite some decent hits, the likes of Atomic Kitten, B*Witched and Honeyz never achieved the same cultural dominance. The situation is worse post-Little Mix: the girl bands hoping to fill the void are, frankly, lacklustre. SVN, a group made up of the original cast of the musical Six plus an understudy, are peddling trite girlboss empowerment anthems that, in an era of Billie Eilish and Olivia Rodrigo’s weighty emo pop, feel dated. The atrociously named CuteBad, a new group backed by Girls Aloud hit-makers Xenomania, feel as if they’re desperately chasing K-pop maximalism but are already struggling to keep hold of band members. Another Xenomania outfit, Unperfect, split up before they got going, while groups like Ring the Alarm and Four of Diamonds have tried and failed to capture pop fans’ attention. Only the London trio FLO have sparked any excitement. Their debut single, Cardboard Box, produced by MNEK, is a fun hit of nostalgic 00s R&B, although it lacks the sizzling originality of Overload by Sugababes, a group that FLO are heavy-handedly styled after. It might be unfair to write these groups off before they’ve had a chance to thrive: a large part of their failure is down to a simple lack of good tunes. Yet they also seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding of what makes a girl band great. Twenty-five years ago, Sporty, Scary, Posh, Ginger and Baby were as recognisable as a red doubledecker bus. The Spice Girls’ message of girl power, lifted and commodified from its riot grrrl beginnings, signified a new era of empowerment for women and girls that prioritised independence and female friendship, and helped to push third-wave feminism – increasingly sex positive and racially inclusive – into the mainstream. Aiding this was the group’s anarchism: from those first few frames of the Wannabe video, invading the posh halls of London’s St Pancras building, they disturbed the priggish elitism that typified British culture, Mel B turning to the camera and ushering the viewer to follow suit. This behaviour spilled into real life, too: interviews with the band were disorderly, with them interrupting the (usually male) interviewers and cackling with laughter. Mockery, of each other and whoever was interviewing them, was also common, although the silliness was almost always punctuated with emotional sincerity, or seriousness on topics such as sexism and misogyny, spoken without media-trained polish. Such unfiltered charisma is absent in a band like SVN, whose basic feminist bromides feel better suited to advertising moisturiser than resonating with a more sophisticated generational understanding of girl power. The individualisation of the Spice Girls’ five members gave fans multiple access points, too. If you didn’t relate to Mel B’s scrappy truculence or Geri’s confident vampishness, then Emma Bunton’s geniality, Victoria’s detachment or Mel C’s determination might better fit your temperament. But, when taken as a whole, they represented the diversity of female friendship groups up and down the UK, where each person had something unique to give. Today, record labels seem set on marketing girl bands as single units, a fatal misunderstanding of girl group dynamics – and of individualised social media culture: it was impossible to differentiate the members of Four of Diamonds, while CuteBad’s emphasis on party-girl aesthetics has so far stripped the members of their personalities. Spice Girls wouldn’t have mattered if their music was garbage, but, unlike the Hi-NRG dance pop and new jack swing that typified most pop bands of the time, their music spanned groove-filled R&B, disco, funk, 60s girl groups and, later, Latin-inflected pop. Aside from FLO’s throwback R&B, an outlier in a pop landscape that now favours moody singer-songwriters and 00s samples, all other recent UK girl bands have produced music without any identity. CuteBad’s You Don’t Really Wanna lacks any discernible melodic thread, while Gots to Give the Girl, the debut single by Unperfect, attempted relaxed California breeziness to the point of narcolepsy. British girl bands conceived in the wake of the Spice Girls often failed to capture their lawless ebullience. This was sometimes by design: All Saints, with their sophisticated trip-hop, were like a Silk Cut and a glass of wine compared with the Spice Girls’ candyfloss. Effortless cool was the initial MO for Sugababes, too, although they also arrived with an angsty sense of disaffected ambivalence and an innovative sound in the shape of Overload. (You wonder whether the Spice Girls’ anarchy – stealing their master tapes pre-fame, sacking their manager – made the record industry exert a tighter grip on the doggedly kid-friendly girl bands who came in their wake, such as B*Witched.) Only Girls Aloud came close to recapturing the spirited chaos of the Spice Girls. Their music was often idiosyncratic: while they weren’t immune to bland covers, songs like Biology and Sexy! No No No … stitched together disparate hooks and textures. Distinct identities helped sell these pop curios: Cheryl Tweedy and the late, great Sarah Harding became tabloid fixtures, famous not only for their late-night antics but also their gobbiness (like Cheryl’s criticisms of other pop stars such as Nicole Scherzinger and Lily Allen). Again, they all felt like individuals who could come together to form something greater. Little Mix took longer to prove themselves: as the first band to win The X Factor, they had a harder time distancing themselves from their reality TV beginnings, especially as they arrived when One Direction controlled the world of pop. What they had was a sense of sisterly solidarity not felt since those early days of the Spice Girls: the band members cared deeply for one another (though the departure of Jesy Nelson has brought to light some discontent they had previously kept hidden). Like many of their fans, Little Mix fell victim to the public abuse and bullying potentiated by Instagram and Twitter: that Little Mix would then get on stage full of confidence and sexiness helped others feel that they, too, could take control and conquer their lives. And that’s exactly what Little Mix did, hitting back against jibes from Noel Gallagher and Piers Morgan, and splitting from Simon Cowell’s record label. Little Mix also levelled up the UK girl band. Performances by groups such as the Saturdays and even Girls Aloud had a ropiness to them (arguably this was part of their charm) but Little Mix threw themselves into precise choreography and powerhouse vocals. Although vocal strength has never been a prerequisite for the girl band, the low-key, low-energy, girl-next-door styling of this new crop will feel very drab after Little Mix’s explosive arena finale. However, the Spice Girls, Girls Aloud and Little Mix all benefited from a pop market that wasn’t as saturated with artists as it is today, and in the case of the latter two, a big reality TV springboard. Today, TikTok’s guileless stars have created a growing distrust of artifice – something that is incompatible with manufactured girl groups. Anyone with a whiff of label interference is swiftly shot down as an industry plant. As Dorian Lynskey wrote in the Guardian of the wider malaise surrounding the band format, in rock or pop, the limited size of a phone screen, and the portrait format of TikTok, favours the solo artist. Shrinking budgets at record labels may also be to blame – girl bands, with their multiple members, glam squads, choreographers and travel needs are a poor investment – and with musicians making so little money from music these days, why would any singer want to split their royalties four ways? So in the era of the solo artist, the closest we have to a girl band is when these solo artists collaborate. Sometimes, such as Charli XCX, Christine and the Queens and Caroline Polachek’s various team-ups, these are explorations of simpatico pop sensibilities; others, like Dua Lipa and Megan Thee Stallion’s collaboration Sweetest Pie, are calculated positioning exercises. Supergroups such as US-based Boygenius, comprising Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers and Lucy Dacus, could also signify the next iteration of the girl band: the thought of Bree Runway, Raye and other UK pop stars going full Avengers is certainly appealing. K-pop, of course, is a space where the girl band is thriving: groups like Blackpink, Twice and Everglow offer whiplash-inducing choreography, bombastic bangers and luminescent visuals with astonishingly high production values that make UK efforts look embarrassingly budget by comparison. But a new girl band is what Britain needs. If the Spice Girls took the lairy masculine energy of 90s Britain and powerfully feminised it, whoever follows Little Mix needs to similarly tap into the spirit of the age. They will require chemistry, strong personalities, irreverence, a cache of bangers, and an ability to commune with the mood of the country: one that has now been ravaged by a decade of austerity, the fallout from Brexit and vicious culture wars. Bleak times, currently soothed by the sad girls of bedroom pop, also need brightening with bold, dynamic talent, not the second-guessing of major labels. It is a mighty task, but only then will the UK spice up its life once more – Lord knows, we need it.",Arts/Music,​Girl bands made British pop great – so where have all the good ones gone?​,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/11/girl-bands-british-pop-svn-cutebad-little-mix-spice-girls
5/11/2022,"After pleading unsuccessfully for affordable housing to help ease her chronic health condition, a Canadian woman ended her life in February under the country’s assisted-suicide laws. Another woman, suffering from the same condition and also living on disability payments, has nearly reached final approval to end her life. The two high-profile cases have prompted disbelief and outrage, and shone a light on Canada’s right-to-die laws, which critics argue are being misused to punish the poor and infirm. In late April, the Spectator ran a story with the provocative headline: Why is Canada euthanising the poor? But medical and legal experts caution that oversimplified media coverage of the cases fail to capture the realities of the system – and warn that sensationalist coverage of a handful of “extreme” cases ignores a larger crisis in the country’s healthcare systems. In February, a 51-year-old Ontario woman known as Sophia was granted physician-assisted death after her chronic condition became intolerable and her meagre disability stipend left her little to survive on, according to CTV News. “The government sees me as expendable trash, a complainer, useless and a pain in the ass,” she said in a video obtained by the network. For two years, she and friends had pleaded without success for better living conditions, she said. Now a second case has emerged with several parallels: another woman, known as Denise, has also applied to end her life after being unable to find suitable housing and struggling to survive on disability payments. Both were diagnosed with multiple chemical sensitivity (MCR), a condition in which common chemicals, such as those in cigarette smoke and laundry detergents, can trigger nausea, blinding headaches and in extreme cases, anaphylactic shock. Both had also argued that specialized housing – where air flow is more controlled – would ease their debilitating symptoms. Unable to work, they each received $1,169 per month – placing them well below the poverty line in Canada’s most populous and expensive province. For activists, the cases have come to represent Canada’s failure to care for its most vulnerable citizens – and raised questions about how assisted-suicide laws are applied. But experts caution the cases are also being used by groups opposed to medical assistance in death (Maid) in an attempt to scale back legislation – rather than looking at how governments can improve people living with disabilities. “Inadequate housing is not one of the eligibility criteria for medical assistance in dying. While somebody’s living circumstances may contribute to their suffering, it does not constitute the grievous and irremediable medical condition, which must exist,” said Chantal Perrot, a physician and Maid provider. Perrot said that while housing could have helped, it was only a part of a broader struggle against the chronic condition. “The only treatment really for that is avoidance of all triggers. That’s pretty much impossible to do in ordinary life. So better housing can create a temporary bubble for a person – but there’s no cure for this,” she said. “We do this work because we believe in people’s right to an assisted death. It’s not always easy to do. But we know that patients need it and value it. We live with the challenge of the work, in part because it is important to alleviate that suffering.” When Canada introduced legislation on assisted suicide in 2016, advocacy groups raised fears that vulnerable populations could be targeted, or that physicians would be forced to override the oaths they’d taken to protect patents. “Many of the slippery-slope arguments that were made initially never happened,” said Hillary Ferguson, a bioethicist at Dalhousie University. “There were fears that the floodgates would open and all these people would be accessing Maid or even forced upon them. But that’s not been the case.” Last year, lawmakers revised the criteria for MAID after the country’s supreme court ruled that a previous version of the law, which excluded people with disabilities, was unconstitutional. The issue is once again before a special joint parliamentary committee tasked with deciding whether to expand access to consenting children and those with mental illness. Jocelyn Downie, a professor of law at Dalhousie and expert in end-of-life policy, said there are extensive guardrails in the system to protect Canadians. “You have to meet rigorous eligibility criteria. And being poor and not having a home, or a home that is suitable for you, does not make you eligible,” said Downie. Cases that involve a chronic condition are often time-consuming because clinicians are working to exhaust all other options to ease the suffering of their patients, she said. Downie said that the cases do highlight societal failures – but not with the country’s assisted dying laws. “Listen to what people living with disabilities have been asking for years,” she said, pointing to investments in accessible housing and transportation. Instead of fighting over the law, which lawmakers are unlikely to repeal given a string of supreme court cases upholding the right to physician assisted death, Downie said a greater emphasis should be on disability supports and services and mental health supports. “The reality is, it’s a small number of people who qualify for Maid. But investments in mental health and disability resources would go so far to help so many more people live their lives.”",News/World news,Assisted deaths of two Canadian women living in poverty puts spotlight on euthanasia laws,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/11/canada-cases-right-to-die-laws
5/11/2022,"Walking in, it is hard to tell where the jungle ends and the building begins. Thick green tendrils curl down from above, filtering light over paths of sinewy bejuco vine. Trees are everywhere: sprouting through the floor, bending polished concrete surfaces to their will and soaring towards the roof. The air is humid and carries a vegetal musk. It is less like being in a gallery than a vast grove, with slight Star Wars forest moon vibes. You wouldn’t be entirely surprised to find an Ewok hanging out in the canopy above. As art spaces go, SFER IK Uh May is certainly unusual – and not only because it’s located in the forests of the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico, in what feels very much like the middle of nowhere. Opened in 2018, then closed again by the pandemic, the 10-acre complex aspires to be a new kind of museum, at harmony with its surroundings and open to the kinds of art that would never make their way into MoMA or Tate. In a shady corner of the gallery – I’ve been asked to remove my shoes – a team of technicians is perched on scaffolding installing an artwork by the Japanese “botanical sculptor” Azuma Makoto: a large, teetering piece assembled using indigenous plants from across Mexico. As cacti, hot-pink bougainvillaea and snake plants are lowered into place on a wooden framework, Makoto supervises politely, snipping a leaf or two, or requesting that a spray of flowers be moved a few inches to the left. As the growing cycle does its thing, the piece, called “Mexx”, will change beyond all recognition, he explains. “It’s living,” he says. “Some parts will come into flower, other plants will die back. In six months, it will be completely unrecognisable.” And after that? “We take it apart and give it to the community. It will go back to nature.” In the last few years, sustainability has become the hottest of topics in the art world – as well it should, given that this most globalised of industries is estimated to produce roughly 70m tonnes of CO2 equivalent a year, more than some European countries. But in this corner of Mexico, the Argentinian self-taught architect, hotel owner, entrepreneur and (now) museum founder Eduardo Neira is attempting a unique experiment: to see if nature itself can be a kind of sustainable artwork. Sitting in the equally extraordinary residence he designed for himself next door, Neira (who goes by the name Roth, for reasons that are somewhat cryptic) confirms that, yes, those are real trees inside the gallery, in fact nearly 200 of them – left untouched where they were growing while the museum was erected around them. “It’s not decoration,” he says. “It’s a profound effort to recognise that we are part of nature.” Constructed by a large team of local craftspeople over a year, SFER IK is made up of a broad dome, punctuated with log bridges that lead into the trees beyond, and surrounded by a flower-filled garden where you can lounge and absorb the jungle views. From a distance, it looks rather like a rock formation growing out of the forest. I keep thinking of Victorian tropical houses such as those at Kew Gardens – but then of course this is actually in the tropics, where many of those plants come from. Rather than being another identikit white-cube-style art space, the architecture aims to be “biophilic”, says Roth: embracing the jungle rather than rejecting it. “We live in boxes. We play in squares. We work in squares. We study in squares. Our mind is a square.” How did they decide on the building’s form? It was largely improvised on site, he replies. “No plans, not even a measure.” Whatever the exact truth of that, there are no right angles in view, with undulating floorscapes and curvilinear windows giving on to the greenery. Back inside, I ask SFER IK’s new director, the Brazilian curator Marcello Dantas, if it isn’t a nightmare to stage exhibitions in. He nods enthusiastically: that’s very much the point. “The approach here is perceptual. Our approach is to ask artists to create something original, site-specific, organically constructed.” Unlike most museums, SFER IK doesn’t possess a collection, and can’t offer the strict environmental conditions required to display many artworks (it seems unlikely that anyone would lend a Rothko or Gentileschi if it risked being covered in leaf mould). Indeed, simply getting sculptures or paintings along the dirt track leading from the nearest village would be hard, Dantas explains. But they’re trying to use this as a spur to interdisciplinary imagination. “Sure, the vegetation inside means that the humidity changes, which means that oil paint will find this environment difficult. But oil paints didn’t invent art. Just use a different kind of paint!” Instead, Dantas adds, they take their inspiration from the original meaning of the word “museum”, which derives from the Greek mouseion, meaning “temple of the muses”. “A temple of the muses is a place you come to be inspired. And that’s exactly what this is.” Funding comes chiefly from Roth’s own Azulik eco-hotel resort along the coast in Tulum, which has become hugely fashionable in recent years and now claims to be the most Instagrammed hotel in the world). Like the resort, which relies on an incessant stream of foreign visitors flying into Cancún airport – among them, of course, me – the ecological credentials of the museum seem a little questionable. Despite the use of local materials, the building also employs concrete and fibreglass, there are air conditioning units hidden among the plant life, and, on a peninsula whose delicate ecosystem is threatened by overdevelopment and water pollution, electricity and water are drawn from the municipality. But Roth insists that SFER IK’s overall carbon impact is low, and it’s as much a symbol as anything else. “The only thing that makes sense for me is to do as much as I can to reconnect people with nature.” The last 30 years have seen a revolution in our understanding of what museums are and where they can be situated. One part of the new museum world has materialised in struggling post-industrial cities such as Bilbao (Guggenheim), Gateshead (Baltic) and Lens (Louvre-Lens), which have tried to revitalise local economies and draw art lovers to locations few would have visited before. Another has tried to explore relationships between collections and landscape: think of the Tadao Ando-designed Chichu Art Museum, burrowed deep into the Japanese island of Naoshima so that the Monets on its walls blend seamlessly into views of the sea, or of Spain’s Planta Project, created inside a dusty industrial estate not far from Barcelona. Other institutions seek to rewire what museology actually does – among them Zagreb’s Museum of Broken Relationships, opened in 2010, which invites anyone to send in artefacts commemorating love affairs that have gone wrong. Dantas himself has run the interactive Museum of the Portuguese Language in São Paulo and the Museo del Carnaval in Colombia. “Here we’re trying to push the definition of what the museum can be,” he says. “Who said the floors have to be flat? Who said we cannot have fire inside the museum, who said we cannot have water? These are fundamental materials of life.” Another context for the project is the art world’s increasingly guilty attempts to live up to its ecological aspirations and reduce its hefty impact on the planet. In the last few years, museums including Tate, Sweden’s Moderna Museet, the Courtauld and the Natural History Museum have declared a climate “emergency”, pledging to reduce energy consumption, cut down on shipping works by plane, recycle exhibition materials and more. Under the umbrella of the Gallery Climate Coalition (founded in 2020), even small commercial spaces have pledged to end their addiction to long-haul flights. In a globalised and hyper-connected art world, in which curators, gallerists and collectors have become used to jetting from Middle Eastern art fair to European biennale to North American opening, this is a challenge, Dantas admits: when we speak, he’s just off the plane from SXSW in Texas, and will shortly be flying back to Brazil. “But I see it as two levels,” he says. “The burden of transporting ideas, and the burden of transporting stuff. If we stop exchanging ideas and people, we’re going to go into a dark age. But when I see a work travelling from art fair to art fair, then to storage, on to another storage unit and never reaching the public, then I see a tremendous waste.” Does he not worry about the impact of art tourism, especially on this fragile corner of the planet? “Everything has a footprint. The challenge is to make it sustainable.” We stroll back towards Makoto’s sculpture, which is slowly acquiring colour as flowering plants are set in place. A river of thick leaves cascades shaggily down one wooden leg. At the summit, a technician is manoeuvring a small palm tree, which sticks jauntily upwards like a quiff. Dantas pauses next to a tree, placing his hand against the bark. It would delight him if creatures from the jungle trotted or flew inside and responded to the art, he says with a twinkle. “Just as the architecture had to respect the trees, the artists will have to respect the trees; they’re going to have to find a way to cohabitate.” He gestures around. “Wouldn’t this be a good watchword for all of us species, as we face the future?”  Mexx is at SFER IK Uh May,, Mexico, until 7 September",Arts/Art and design,Welcome to the jungle: inside Mexico’s groundbreaking natural art gallery,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/11/welcome-to-the-jungle-inside-mexicos-groundbreaking-natural-art-gallery
5/11/2022,"A mythical land where the ancient Minoans had many of their settlements, palaces and places of worship, eastern Crete is an enchanting – and lesser explored – region where life is serenaded by the lap of waves on the brightly painted hulls of traditional fishing boats, and the Alpine-like jingle of bells as shepherds take their flocks to graze in high pastures. The scenery is laced with tiny hamlets that seem lost in time (in the best possible way) and golden, sand-lined coves lapped by turquoise waters, where it’s possible to laze all day without seeing a soul. The unofficial capital of Crete’s east coast is the lively town of Agios Nikolaos, with its colourful labyrinth of shopping lanes, Venetian promenade and the legendary Lake Voulismeni at its centre where, according to mythology, the goddess Athena once bathed. Enjoy a leisurely meal in one of the laid-back tavernas around this mirror-clear pool and then follow roads fringed with sweet-scented wild fennel to Elounda. Despite briefly having a name as a swinging 60s hangout for the likes of Aristotle and Jackie Onassis, this fishing village – like the rest of this lovely region – is still surprisingly lowkey. A fisherman on Elounda bay; a selection of local cheeses; the town of Agios Nikolaos and Lake Voulismeni (below) Clustered around a harbour where fishermen can often be found sitting and mending their nets, Elounda is also home to quaint shops selling woven goods, ceramics and other souvenirs, as well as a surprising number of restaurants, bars and tavernas. And, like so many other places in this storied region, it is historically significant: Elounda lies on the site of what was one of Crete’s most important cities in antiquity. Reached via a narrow isthmus, the sunken city-state of Olous was built by the Dorians and even mentioned in Homer’s epics. The waters of Elounda (top); Spinalonga (below) From Elounda, traditional two-masted caique wooden fishing boats sail across the glittering waters of Mirabello bay to Spinalonga, where Victoria Hislop’s bestselling novel The Island was set. Here, you can spend a few hours exploring the Venetian fortifications and stone buildings of this haunting location, where the members of Greece’s last leper colony lived until 1957 – and then make a beeline for some of the beautiful Blue Flag beaches for which this part of Crete is renowned. Vai beach is fringed by Europe’s only palm forest Elsewhere, the nearby town of Malia also has plenty of golden sandy beaches lapped by sparkling waters, while the coast between Elounda and Istro is studded with a multitude of pristine coves. If you’re feeling adventurous, head farther east to laze in the shadow of Europe’s only palm forest on Vai beach, near Sitia; or take a boat from Ierapetra in the south to seek out the sea daffodil-studded dunes and ancient salt pans on eastern Crete’s Natura 2000-protected island of Chrysi. Eastern Crete is more than just glorious seascapes, however: head inland and you’ll discover the windmill-studded Lasithi plateau, known for its rugged landscapes, fertile soil and traditional hamlets such as Kritsa – home to the famed Panagia Kera church. It is also an area rich in mythology; about an hour’s drive from Kritsa is the tiny village of Psychro, where you can begin the ascent to the far-flung Diktaean cave, which is said to be the birthplace of Zeus. Having worked up a sufficient appetite, take the chance to sample some of the local cuisine in Psychro, or in any number of the nearby mountain villages, where tiny tavernas serve (usually grandma’s) homemade food. And since Crete is reputed even among the Greeks as the country’s friendliest island, don’t be surprised if you’re offered a complimentary glass or several of raki after dinner. Chrysi island (top); the church of Panagia Kera; dinner fresh from the sea Blue Palace, a Luxury Collection Resort, EloundaA stone’s throw from some of the island’s top attractions – including the ancient Minoan palace of Knossos, the Lasithi plateau and the historic island of Spinalonga – Blue Palace sits high on a hilltop with stunning views over Elounda’s deep azure bay. With its own spacious private beach and showstopping infinity pool, the resort is dotted with mosaics, rough-hewn brick walls, chandeliers and curvy divans – culminating in the stunning atrium lounge overlooking its pool. Enjoy aperitivos at Arsenali If that sounds fancy, then get ready to take it up a step: inside Blue Palace lies what can only be described as a resort within a resort – the Haven Collection, home to its most exclusive suites and villas. With an emphasis on privacy and space, expect uninterrupted sea views and elegant interiors, in addition to attentive, personalised service as part of this extra glamorous enclave. With five on-site restaurants and two bars, Blue Palace guests can drift from sunset aperitivos at Arsenali to pan-Asian food at Asia Deep Blue. Authenticity and seasonality is the focus here, with menus curated by acclaimed creative consultant chef Athinagoras Kostakos and executive chef Giannis Kallivretakis, reflecting a love for the fresh and local seen most strongly at Anthós, the farm-to-table contemporary Greek restaurant, as well as at Blue Door, the resort’s very own quintessentially Greek taverna. The stunning suites at Blue Palace provide the perfect home base for exploring the region’s charming towns and villages Whether you’re using it as a jumping-off point to explore the Mirabello Bay and beyond, indulge in local food experiences, or just coming to lay poolside with a book overlooking the Aegean Sea, a stay at Blue Palace merges nature, luxury and signature Greek hospitality. Cretan Malia ParkBuried in palm-fronded greenery near the town of Malia, Cretan Malia Park’s manicured lawns lined with sweet-scented flowers overlook a strip of Blue Flag beaches dotted with sunbeds and swing hammocks, perfect for sunbathing and sundowners alike. Focused on sustainability and authenticity, the Design Hotels member has several superb restaurants – including Mouries, where chef Lefteris Iliadis serves up contemporary Cretan food in an outdoor open kitchen setting. A plethora of beach activities are also on offer – and when you’re ready to unwind, you can indulge in treatments using selected cruelty-free products at Cute Spa. Village Heights ResortA short hop from Crete’s capital Heraklion is Village Heights Resort – Crete’s mindful retreat, home to an inviting range of suites clustered around its infinity pool and surrounded by lush vegetation, with views over Crete’s north-eastern coastline. With its a nine-hole mini golf course, a spa with a pool, sauna, steam room, and children’s pools, there’s plenty to do around the resort during the day. Keen golfers will also enjoy reduced green fees at the nearby Crete Golf Club, while Stalida’s sandy beaches are within easy reach. Village Heights is also home to two signature restaurants, serving up stylish spins on local specialities, as well a luxe indoor lounge bar and an outdoor snack bar by the pool.

5/11/2022,"With dozens of Blue Flag beaches and 300 days of sunshine, it’s little wonder Cyprus is such a popular holiday destination. But beyond the promise of sunny days and balmy nights, it is also a land of legends and love. As the birthplace of Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty, the island has golden sunsets and enchanting viewpoints in abundance. Throw in the countless candlelit dinner options, from bougainvillea-cloaked taverns to private yacht affairs, as well as luxurious stays tailored to twosomes (more about that later) and a summer-long meteor shower, and you’ve got an irresistible setting for a romantic getaway. The village of Pelendri So where to begin? Although the third largest island in the Mediterranean, Cyprus is still compact enough to make experiencing its highlights easy. One of its most renowned (and romantic) attractions is Petra tou Romiou, otherwise known as Aphrodite’s Rock. Located off a narrow stretch of beach between Limassol and Paphos, it is here that the goddess legendarily rose from sea foam – and the story goes that anyone who swims around this iconic beauty spot three times will find true love. The goddess’s adventures also touch the west coast of the island, where a small pool known as the Bath of Aphrodite is said to have been her favoured bathing spot – and the place she met her lover Adonis, a hunter who stopped here for a drink of water and fell instantly in love with her. Leading away from the natural grotto are two shaded hiking trails, appropriately called Adonis and Artemis. Aphrodite’s Rock (top); the Bath of Aphrodite; hiking at Cape Greco Unsurprisingly, the island’s deep-rooted romantic history has inspired many lovebirds to tie the knot among its olive groves, hilltop wineries and coastal outcrops. Their usual backdrop? A dreamy sunset. Rural Paphos’s Akamas peninsula at the south-western tip of the island is one of its best spots for sunset chasers, while the imposing rock formations of Cape Greco headland are a choice spot for sunset spotting (and wedding photos), and Ayia Napa’s cliffs, paired with sea caves and aquamarine waters, also create an impressive frame for a sunset. Visitors to Cyprus in August will also be treated to a spectacular – and spectacularly romantic – light show in the form of the Perseids meteor shower. Think of them as nature’s fireworks. And while Ayia Napa is known for its nightlife, it is also a destination of abundant beauty and variety. The natural stone arch Kamara tou Koraka, fittingly known as the love or lovers bridge, is well worth visiting – as is the picturesque blue and white church of Ayioi Anargyroi, built on top of a sea cave on the curve of the coast. For an unforgettable activity as a couple, it would be hard to beat a day spent scuba diving or snorkelling around the nearby Museum of Underwater Sculpture, a spectacular sunken gallery containing 93 sculptures designed to rehabilitate the local marine ecosystem. When you’re done there for the day, head back to Ayia Napa marina for a sundowner before dinner. Rock formations at Cape Greco (top); Ayia Napa Sculpture Park Where to stayA short walk away from the centre of Ayia Napa and its Blue Flag Pantachou beach is the brand-new Amanti MadeforTwo Hotel. A couples-only escape, the hotel is all about deep relaxation and quality together time, with facilities, experiences and services all designed with two in mind. The Amanti MadeforTwo Hotel The chill starts immediately. Sunbed stress be gone; each couple has their own saved spot to soak up the rays together, with fresh fruit, juices, smoothies and cool wet towels delivered to you while you lounge. When you’re ready for a dip, there are two stunning outdoor pools to choose from, both with their own hydro massage areas, as well as Pantachou beach right on your doorstep. For even deeper relaxation à deux, there is the Evera Spa and Wellness centre, where signature treatments including massage, exfoliation and aromatherapy – are designed to be enjoyed in tandem. Couples-only Amanti MadeforTwo Hotel offers relaxation and fine dining, such as pan flashed salmon and crispy black rice, at the hotel’s rooftop restaurant, Immenso Included in every stay is Amanti’s Half-Board Premium dining experience, which allows guests to sample each of the hotel’s à la carte restaurants – and selection of complimentary drinks. The hotel’s four signature restaurant concepts have been created in collaboration with Michelin-starred chef Theodor Falser. At the hotel’s rooftop – and one of the Ayia Napa’s highest points – is Immenso, which offers Nikkei cuisine, blending flavours from Asia and Latin America. For local flavours, Fort O Lana terrace restaurant serves contemporary Cypriot cuisine, with goddess-inspired cocktails Aphrodite and Selene. For all-day dining there’s Ezaría, named after the Greek word for dining room (trapezaria), with buffet breakfast and lunch options, and nightly-changing themed dinner menus. And for that extra sprinkle of romance, Nocturne serves modern Mediterranean fine dining accompanied by gentle live piano.

5/11/2022,"With hindsight, the environmental activist Helen Steel, a key figure in the 1990s McLibel case, can see that her life with John Dines was suspiciously idyllic. When they met, at a London Greenpeace meeting in the late 1980s, she was spending her free time protesting against nuclear weapons at Greenham Common, or staying in mining villages supporting striking miners. Soon he was enthusiastically joining her on hunt saboteur trips to disrupt grouse shoots in Yorkshire, or on demonstrations against the poll tax, and spending his weekends with her, helping to campaign against the environmental record of McDonald’s. It was only decades after their relationship ended that she began to understand that they got on so well because Dines was using a battery of grooming techniques perfected by colleagues in an undercover police division. The undercover officers in Dines’s unit presented themselves as vulnerable and alone in the world; often they would say they were recently bereaved or estranged from their families, preying on the women’s good nature, inviting their sympathy and love. The first time Steel went to the pub with Dines, he said his father had died very suddenly. A few months later, he told her his mother had also died unexpectedly; he said he was short of money, so she lent him the funds to fly to New Zealand for the funeral. She began to feel sorry for him and somehow these feelings evolved into a more complicated sense of attachment. Steel was just 23 when they met and was initially surprised that a man five years older than her should be so interested, but they seemed to have a lot in common, particularly their politics, so when he asked her out, eventually she agreed. They found a flat in London and moved in together. They had wonderful holidays in the Outer Hebrides and at Camber Sands. All the while he was telling her he wanted to buy a small house in the countryside with his inheritance, somewhere he could dig a duck pond for her and they could settle down and have six children. “We got on so well, sharing many of the same interests and never having arguments … Life with John was idyllic,” she writes in Deep Deception, an extraordinary account of how undercover officers from the Metropolitan police’s special demonstration squad (SDS) deceived dozens of women into fake relationships, co-written with four other women who were similarly ensnared. “All of us began by thinking that the men had in some way genuinely cared about us – even after we discovered that they were undercover officers,” she says now, describing how her anger mounted steadily as she researched and wrote the book. “As we talked through what happened to us, we saw so many patterns; it really rammed it home that there weren’t any genuine moments – they were purely manipulative and abusive.” Throughout the time they were together, Dines was married to someone else; his parents were alive and well. When his deployment was over, he left a note on the kitchen table telling her that he needed some space and abruptly disappeared. There can be no clearer example of misogyny within the Met than the undercover police division’s treatment of these women, who were duped into relationships by officers who used them to construct convincing alter egos, to mask the surveillance work they were doing on small, mostly left-leaning and non-violent protest groups. “I still don’t think the police get it. That was our purpose in writing this book – we wanted to expose the institutional sexism that allowed these relationships to happen and to stop more women being abused by officers. It’s very easy for an individual’s experience to be written off as a glitch, or just the responsibility of an individual officer, but the strength of us writing our story together – you start to see patterns, and it is the patterns that demonstrate that this was a systemic problem,” she says. Even people who think they are familiar with the broad outlines of the undercover cop scandal will be astonished by the contents of Deep Deception. The book weaves together the women’s experiences chronologically, revealing in horrifying detail how they were each tricked into relationships. One of the women lived for five years with a man with whom she hoped to have children, before he disappeared unexpectedly and without trace; it turned out he had been married with three young children throughout the time they had been together. Another had a relationship stretching more than seven years, while another from their group had two children with an officer, believing that he had genuine feelings for her. “The betrayal and the Orwellian surveillance behind it have devastated lives,” the introduction notes. But the book is a triumphant exercise in exploding the women’s status as victims; it goes on to describe their success in subsequently exposing the cynical and sordid full extent of the spy cops operation. Steel is not sure whether she was selected randomly as a way of giving Dines credibility within the activist community, or if she was targeted because of her involvement in the McDonald’s campaign. Shortly after they began their relationship in the early 90s, she was walking with Dines back to his flat when she was served with a libel writ by McDonald’s over a leaflet she had helped produce highlighting the environmental damage caused by the burger chain; she now believes he must have been involved in helping organise for the writ to be served. The case would become the longest-running legal battle in English history. Steel and her co-defendant, Dave Morris (an unemployed postal worker), became famous globally for their dogged refusal to apologise in the face of McDonald’s multimillion-pound lawsuit. As Steel prepared her defence, Dines would obligingly pick her up from meetings with the young lawyer who was helping her – a newly qualified Keir Starmer – enabling him to hear all about the defence arguments as he drove her home. Later it would emerge that another undercover officer from the same SDS unit had helped draft the offending leaflet. “They targeted anyone with a desire to protest against the status quo, anyone attempting to hold the government or big business to account. Only a handful of far-right groups were infiltrated among the many hundreds of leftwing ones,” she says. “A large part of their function seemed to be to protect corporate interests.”This riveting book exposes repeat patterns of abusive behaviour by the undercover cops, revealing how the men used well-honed strategies for building up relationships and jettisoning them at the end of the deployment. The officers were adept at a method known as “mirroring”: subtly latching on to things the women were interested in and later declaring that they, too, shared those same passions – the same music, politics, books, commitment to vegetarianism. It becomes clear that they were passing on tips and guidance to each other on how to manipulate the women they were using to provide a front for their undercover work. The undercover officers had vans and flexible work that made them available for transporting people to and from activist meetings – allowing them to eavesdrop on plans. The freelance nature of their pretend jobs (as gardeners, carpenters or delivery drivers) also permitted them to disappear for protracted stretches to spend time with their real families. They exited suddenly, after announcing they were having breakdowns and needed space; they disappeared to South Africa or the US and appeared to be untraceable. The women were devastated at the abrupt end of relationships, upset for themselves, but also worried about the welfare of the defenceless, lonely men they had loved. Steel’s story has been written about previously (not least in the excellent Undercover, by the Guardian journalists Rob Evans and Paul Lewis), but the extent to which her life was messed up by the decision of Dines to dupe her into a relationship is laid bare in this book. It is a shocking and at times painful-to-read series of dizzying, life-shattering deceptions. For a while, Steel had some residual affection for Dines; it was hard to believe that there had been nothing genuine in his behaviour towards her over the two years they had lived together. Subsequently, she has met more than two dozen other women similarly abused and her gaze has hardened. The Met continues to insist that these relationships were unsanctioned misdemeanours committed by individual rogue officers, but Steel believes this is nonsense. “We could see that what had seemed like heart-wrenching stories told by the officers at the time were so similar they could only have come through shared practice. It was chilling,” she says. Four of the women behind the book have chosen to remain anonymous, but Steel long ago abandoned any attempt to box off this chunk of her life. She writes with powerful rage about the women’s continuing battle for justice. “We were often portrayed as victims with no agency and we wanted to show that it was our detective work that uncovered this scandal, and to show that fighting back against those abuses was an empowering experience,” she says.Although there have been public apologies and financial settlements for some of the women, the book highlights how energetically the police continues to obstruct the women’s campaign to get answers. In a post #MeToo era, at a time when the Met is facing the fallout from its handling of Sarah Everard’s death, it seems remarkable that the force is resisting these women’s requests for disclosure about the details of their cases, by refusing to release the files on them. “These are akin to Stasi files. All kinds of information was put down in these police files. It is grossly intrusive. There’s no justification in a democracy for keeping those kinds of files,” Steel says. It is particularly startling to register how consistently the women’s experiences have been trivialised in the years since they exposed the unit’s actions. A judge hearing their case in 2013 described the police officers as “cads”. Another judge, Mr Justice Tugendhat, hearing a different part of the case that year, made a peculiar reference to James Bond to provide context for the behaviour of the police, arguing that the fictional spy’s behaviour showed how the intelligence services had for years used “officers to form personal relationships of an intimate sexual nature … in order to obtain information or access”. The women were treated dismissively during a home affairs select committee hearing. Writing in the Daily Mail in 2014, Richard Littlejohn derided the women as “an assortment of unwashed dopey birds who slept with undercover officers”. Most significantly, an attempt to prosecute the officers for rape and sexual assault failed in 2014, when the Crown Prosecution Service concluded that there was “insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction”. The CPS decision not to prosecute the officers was “absolutely outrageous; totally sexist,” Steel says. “There is no way that we would have consented to these relationships had we known who these men really were and what their purpose was in our lives.” The deception made the women think they were going mad; most were later diagnosed with serious psychological injuries including post-traumatic stress, extreme anxiety, depression and panic attacks. Steel discovered in 1994, through impressive, forensic investigation, that Dines, whom she knew as John Barker, had stolen the identity of a child who had died at eight of leukaemia; some time later, she realised that he was a member of the SDS. Writing the book meant she had to go through diaries and letters from the time of the relationship; she was shocked by how unkind he had been in his treatment of her, particularly the manner of his departure, when he left her and returned repeatedly over several months, telling her he loved her and feeding her new lies about his grief for his fictitiously dead parents. Rereading the letters “really struck home just how abusive and manipulative he was. And that made me really angry; it was as if he set out to destroy my sanity.” Dines, who later moved to Australia, has never explained his behaviour. Steel managed to track him down in 2016 and speak to him at Sydney airport (the mobile phone footage of that brief meeting is worth watching, as a fleeting insight into Dines’ callous dismissal of what he has done). “As far as we know, not a single one of them has faced any consequences for their actions, not even the docking of their pensions,” she says. The impact on the women, however, has been profound. Steel’s faith in her judgment was shattered, so it took a long time before she was able to have another relationship, which meant by the time she started trying to have a family it was difficult. She had seven miscarriages and was ultimately unable to have children. “It has severely affected our ability to trust other people, or to form intimate relationships again. You can’t compensate for that,” she says, noting that even the state compensation system does not see the world from a woman’s perspective, being more inclined to focus on loss of earnings. She is unimpressed by the effusive police apology issued in 2015, which she thinks does not sit well with the persistent refusal to release the women’s files so that they can properly understand why they were targeted and the nature of the information held on them. “There is a tension between them claiming it should never have happened and saying they think it’s appalling, and refusing to tell us the truth about the extent of it and who knew,” she says. In response to the book, the Met reiterated its regret, stating: “Undercover policing has changed significantly with independent judicial oversight of all operations, and past events highlighted in this book in no way reflect modern-day undercover policing. We recognise the hurt and distress caused to the authors of this book. The actions of undercover officers who deceived these women into sexual relationships were totally unacceptable.” A public inquiry into undercover policing has been running since 2015, but progress has been severely hampered by police requests for secrecy. The hearings restarted this week, however the sessions relating to the women’s experiences are not expected to begin until next year. “The public inquiry has been bending over backwards to protect the privacy and feelings of the former undercover officers. There is no concern for our privacy and our right to know,” Steel says. “We all want answers. If the police want to raid someone’s house, they have to apply for a warrant and they have to set out the reasons why they need to search the house. But with these relationships, no warrants needed to be applied for. They were living in our houses and they had access to everything we had in our homes; they had access to the contents of our heads. They could ask us whatever questions they wanted and we would answer – believing they were our trusted partners, not an undercover cop trying to get information. It was disgusting and inhumane abuse.” Deep Deception is published by Ebury Spotlight (£20). To support the Guardian and Observer, order your copy at guardianbookshop.com.
