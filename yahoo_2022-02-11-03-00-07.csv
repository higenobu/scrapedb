2/11/2022,"Kelly Renee Turner was sentenced to 16 years of prison for child abuse leading to the death of her daughter. Turner made her 7-year-old get unnecessary medical treatments and eventually signed a do-not-resuscitate order. She also raised between $100,000 and $1 million in fraudulent charity money and gifts. A Colorado woman who pleaded guilty last month to charges of child abuse causing the death of her 7-year-old daughter was sentenced to 16 years of prison on Wednesday. Kelly Renee Turner, 43, put her daughter Olivia through years of unnecessary medical treatment that eventually led to her death in 2017, the New York Times reported. In a 2019 indictment, prosecutors said Turner first requested treatments for constipation and developmental delays when Olivia was 2 years old. She continued approving ""surgery after surgery"" and eventually put her daughter in hospice care, where she insisted on a do-not-resuscitate order. Turner's stepfather believes that she had a mental disorder called Munchausen syndrome by proxy, meaning she induced illness in her otherwise healthy child to get attention, the family's lawyers said in a statement reported by the Times. ""This is a despicable crime,"" John Kellner, the district attorney, said in the statement. ""This defendant deserves to serve years behind bars."" Turner was arrested in 2018 after seeking unnecessary treatments for another daughter, prompting concern from doctors and welfare workers. Prosecutors said doctors connected the dots once they heard about Olivia's death from a ""mysterious, untreatable illness."" The other daughter's condition improved after she was removed from Turner's care, prosecutors said. The illness scam didn't stop at unnecessary treatments, NBC reported. Turner raised between $100,000 and $1 million in charity money and gifts, not to mention more than $500,000 from Medicaid to cover her daughter's care, prosecutors said. Turner also made sure the news cameras were rolling for many of Olivia's charity experiences, such as a ""bat princess"" party hosted by Make-A-Wish at a hotel that cost $11,000, NBC reported. Along with negligible child abuse, Turner pleaded guilty to charges of theft and charitable fraud. She was initially charged with first-degree murder as well, but the prosecution dropped the murder charges after Turner's plea. Olivia's cause of death, originally listed as intestinal failure, is still not clear. Doctors who testified said Turner's call to stop feeding her daughter likely contributed to her death. The Turner case echoes the story of Dee Dee Blanchard, who had her daughter Gypsy Rose medicated and using a wheelchair and a feeding tube for much of her life to make her appear ill. It turned out Gypsy was not actually sick, but many of the details of the case died with Dee Dee when Gypsy had her murdered in 2015.

2/11/2022,"Jayme Kelly, a nurse, thought she'd slept on her limbs wrong when she woke up numb at age 29. Kelly had had a stroke, and has spent the last couple years in different types of rehab. She's raising awareness of stroke signs and symptoms as an American Heart Association volunteer. Jayme Kelly thought she could sleep it off. The then-29-year-old nurse living near Boston had woken up numb in her right arm and leg, unable to walk to the bathroom or unlock her phone. But she figured she'd just slept on her limbs wrong and everything would be back to normal after a little more rest. After all, Kelly was young, ate healthy, and did Crossfit regularly. But when Kelly's roommate found her a few hours later unable to speak, the roommate called 911. ""Now I'm freaking out, like, what's wrong with me?"" Kelly later learned she'd had a stroke, and she's spent the last couple years out of work and in rehab. Now a volunteer for the American Heart Association's Go Red For Women ""Real Women"" campaign, Kelly is speaking out to raise awareness that stroke can happen to anyone — and that time is of the essence when it comes to getting help. ""Time lost is brain lost,"" she told Insider. Kelly immediately underwent an MRI at the hospital. Hearing the word ""stroke"" was surreal. ""I had every emotion running through my mind at the same time — scared, sad, anxious, angry, like, 'Why me?'"" she said. ""It's hard to come to terms with: I had a stroke."" Testing revealed Kelly had factor V Leiden, a blood disorder that increases the risk of blood clots. She was also on hormonal birth control, which too increases blood clot and stroke risk. The stroke caused weakness on her right side and numbness in her right hand, as well as trouble speaking, writing, and understanding language, Kelly said. She improved steadily with therapy, but couldn't say more than a handful of phrases for six months. Kelly says she otherwise relied on body language and some sign language, which her sister taught her, to communicate. Her one outlet was CrossFit, which emphasizes the types of big functional movements — not small motor skills — she could still perform. ""It gave me a release,"" Kelly said. ""I was really critical of myself that I can't speak well, but I pushed everything down because I didn't want everyone to know how depressed I was."" Now, two and a half years later, Kelly takes blood thinners and continues to undergo speech therapy, occupational therapy, and music therapy. She joined a book club to improve her reading skills. Her work in psychotherapy, including EMDR, which helps process traumatic memories, has been most impactful, she said. ""The more I talked about it, the better I felt,"" Kelly said. ""It's OK to cry, it's OK to be sad and anxious, but you need to talk about it."" Kelly hasn't been able to return to her job at Boston Children's Hospital, but she did take up an independent nurse role for a 4-year-old with cerebral palsy. ""I'm getting better every day,"" she said. According to the American Heart Association, 1 in 5 women has a stroke in her lifetime. Smoking, pregnancy, pre-eclampsia, birth-control pills, and migraines with aura can increase the risk. (Kelly stopped her birth control but can safely go on another type that doesn't have estrogen, her doctor told her.) Kelly wants people, and especially women, to know the signs of stroke, like numbness, confusion, blurred vision, and poor coordination. ""I think women only focus on other people their kids, their parents, their husbands, their friends,"" she said. ""Sometimes we need to focus on ourselves more and then we can focus on everyone else. And if I can have a stroke, so can all of you.""

2/11/2022,"One day after former President Donald Trump endorsed one of her Republican primary challengers, South Carolina U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace stood outside Trump Tower in New York City to make her case. In a video posted to Twitter Thursday morning, Mace defend her political credibility, touted her ties to Trump and questioned Republican Katie Arrington’s ability to deliver for Republicans, even after Arrington secured Trump’s endorsement. “If you want to lose this seat once again in a midterm election cycle to Democrats, then my opponent is more than qualified to do just that,” Mace, a Daniel Island Republican, said in her video. “If you want a Republican majority, if you want someone to continue to represent the Lowcountry, if you want someone to represent a Lowcountry with our fiscally conservative values, then I’m here to serve.” I’m standing in front of Trump Tower with a message this morning…#SC01 #LowcountryFirst pic.twitter.com/CpmMYA63qt — Nancy Mace (@NancyMace) February 10, 2022 Trump made his public pick in South Carolina’s 1st Congressional District race Wednesday evening through his political action committee after Arrington announced her candidacy in a 2-minute online video on Tuesday. His statement spent almost as much time heaping praise on Arrington as it did criticizing Mace. “Katie Arrington is running against an absolutely terrible candidate, Congresswoman Nancy Mace, whose remarks and attitude have been devastating for her community, and not at all representative of the Republican Party to which she has been very disloyal,” Trump said in explaining why he won’t support Mace, despite endorsing her in 2020. “Katie Arrington, on the other hand, is liked and respected and a true Republican.” This is a developing story.

Racking up gold medals is hungry work. American snowboarding legend Chloe Kim successfully defended her gold medal during Thursday's women's halfpipe final at the 2022 Beijing Olympics. And after celebrating her dominant victory and making her way to the post-event press conference, the 21-year-old had a startling realization.

""If anyone has some snacks in their pockets maybe?"" she said, eliciting laughter from around the press room. ""It's lunch time,"" Kim added, looking at her cell phone. The reporters immediately sprang to action, bringing all sorts of treats up to the podium for the two-time gold medalist to enjoy. ""Thank you, thank you,"" Kim said as she collected the goodies. ""It's not a hurry, just thank you. Thank you so much."" ""I'll eat this in a bit,"" she added. The next journalist in line to ask a question paused before asking Kim if she'd like to eat her snacks before answering any more inquiries.
