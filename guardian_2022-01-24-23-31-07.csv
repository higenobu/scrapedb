1/24/2022,"It was Lisa Faulkner’s deep-fried face that started it. Almost 20 years ago, swishy new BBC spy drama Spooks seized viewers by the lapels – and saw the Broadcasting Standards Commission inundated with complaints – in only its second episode when Thames House trainee Helen Flynn (played by Faulkner) volunteered for a risky undercover mission, but found herself getting served up with salt and vinegar. Brookside alumnus and lads’ mag favourite Faulkner had just completed a stint on Holby City. Among a cast of newcomers, hers was the biggest name. Viewers assumed she would be a key player in the show taglined “It’s MI5, not 9 to 5”. Hence it was a jaw-dropper in spring 2002 when her character infiltrated an extremist group but got rumbled and gruesomely murdered.  First, her hand was plunged into a deep-fat fryer by Kevin McNally’s far-right leader, which was wince-inducing enough – until he shoved poor Helen’s head in, too. Her fellow agent, Matthew Macfadyen’s Tom (not Wambsgans, sadly) was held at gunpoint and could only watch in horror. The set piece was originally pencilled in for the series finale, but as producer Jane Featherstone reasoned: “Let’s move the most dramatic thing you’ve got to episode two and kill off the only actress the audience recognise and then you’ve got them hooked.” The Guardian’s Charlie Brooker approved: “The moment her head was forced into the deep-fat fryer, viewers reared on the formulaic, it’ll-be-alright-in-the-end blandness of cookie-cutter populist dramas … sat up and blinked in disbelief: here was a major BBC drama series that actually had the nerve to confound expectation.” Despite airing after the watershed, the grisly scene sparked the most complaints of any show that year. It also set a trend in box set drama for bumping off big names early. It might be risky (what if fans switch off in protest?) but it’s a bold move that drastically raises the stakes. Viewers are kept guessing and gripped. If they can wipe out a headline name, what else might they do? ITV’s bomb disposal drama Trigger Point began with a similarly loud bang on Sunday night. Slight spoiler in case you have miraculously managed to avoid them and intend to catch up, but a central character got blown to smithereens before the credits rolled on the opening episode. As with Spooks, the message to viewers was clear. In this show, the jeopardy is real. Nobody is safe. Trigger Point, of course, hails from the Jed Mercurio stable. The don of tense TV thrillers didn’t script this one, but he executive-produced, and mentored screenwriting debutant Daniel Brierley. Mercurio the Merciless has a track record of swiftly killing off his star signings. Keeley Hawes was blown up by a briefcase bomb before the midway mark of ratings blockbuster Bodyguard. Jessica Raine, Daniel Mays and Jason Watkins got guest-star billing in Line of Duty series two, three and four respectively. None survived beyond the first episode. Sign up a major star, then unceremoniously off them – that’s the Mercurio method. His trademark life-or-death cliffhangers suddenly become a lot more potent when someone genuinely could cark it. (As a budgetary bonus, it also means paying a pricey performer’s fee for fewer episodes.) The trick soon spread across the Atlantic, where perhaps the prime exemplar was Game of Thrones. The debut season of HBO’s shagging-and-dragons saga placed Sean Bean’s brooding patriarch Eddard “Ned” Stark front and centre, not just on the billboard posters but within the narrative. It had been a casting coup to lure the craggy Lord of the Rings star back to the fantasy genre, let alone the small screen. Ned was established as the show’s moral centre – until episode nine, when he was gasp-inducingly beheaded on the whim of punchable poison dwarf Joffrey. “This is probably the first time a US drama series has ever killed off its main character in the first season as part of its master creative plan,” wrote Entertainment Weekly. “It’s just not done. You don’t cast a star, put him on bus stops and magazine ads, get viewers all invested in his story, and then dump him nine episodes later just because it arguably makes the story a bit more interesting.” Oh yes you do. Showrunner DB Weiss admitted that Ned’s early demise had been a “selling point” for him and co-creator David Benioff. “It completely ups the ante whenever a character is in danger if you know someone else didn’t survive a similar situation,” he said. Slaughtering a high-profile cast member early not only has shock value but promises all manner of unexpected twists. Christopher Eccleston’s amiable scientist was viciously mauled to death in the first episode of Sky’s frost-bitten Fortitude. Ariana Grande was dispatched equally swiftly in Ryan Murphy’s Scream Queens, stabbed in the back while sending a tweet. There’s a metaphor in there somewhere. Real-time thriller 24 gleefully killed off anyone who wasn’t Kiefer Sutherland. David Haig’s spook lasted just three episodes of Killing Eve before Villanelle did her thing. Tragedy at the end of act one provides an emotional climax early in the piece. And who can forget Nancy’s beloved bestie Barb (Shannon Purser) getting dragged into the Upside Down and killed by the Demogorgon within two episodes of Stranger Things’ debut season? It not only cranked up the fear factor but made her such a cult figure that #JusticeforBarb trended on Twitter. Purser earned an Emmy nomination for mere minutes of screen time. We got another big one – or should that be Big one? – only last month. Divisive Sex and the City sequel And Just Like That began with Carrie Bradshaw living smugly ever after with John “Mr Big” Preston. Forty cringe-making minutes later, Chris Noth’s cigar-puffing, eyebrow-waggling alpha male keeled over from a fatal heart attack after a home workout – plunging Peloton into a PR crisis in the process. HBO execs can be forgiven for breathing a sigh of relief though, because multiple women have since accused Noth of sexual assault. He has denied the allegations but writing out his character proved a smart move in more ways than one. The show itself immediately switched from nostalgic lifestyle larks to bittersweet sad-com. Not entirely successfully, sure, but at least grief and midlife widowhood made for more interesting subject matter than cosmos, corsages and camp one-liners. And just like that, Carrie swapped her bright blue silk Manolos for a deeper, darker hue. Moral of the story? On 21st-century TV, no character is safe. Nowadays the bigger the star’s name, the higher their odds of getting cruelly killed early doors.

1/24/2022,"A Russian invasion of Ukraine would be “painful, violent and bloody business”, Boris Johnson has warned a “lightning war” was possible but not inevitable. The prime minister said it would be “disastrous” if Vladimir Putin directed thousands of soldiers to cross into Ukraine seeking to take further parts of the country after the annexation of Crimea in 2014.  Russia has mobilised 100,000 troops and heavy weapons on the Ukrainian border. Tensions escalated further when Nato reinforced its eastern borders with land, sea and air forces, while the White House and Downing Street announced some diplomats’ were starting to be withdrawn from the country. Johnson said he would be talking to political leaders “in other capitals and in Washington” on Monday evening. Speaking to broadcasters on a visit to a hospital, Johnson was asked about the prospect of an imminent invasion by Russian troops. “I think the intelligence is pretty gloomy on this point,” he said. “The intelligence is very clear that there are 60 Russian battle groups on the border of Ukraine. The plan for a lightning war that could take out Kyiv is one that everybody can see. We need to make it very clear to the Kremlin that that would be a disastrous step.” Johnson stressed he thought an invasion was not inevitable and that “sense can still prevail” but added the UK was working with other countries to draw up a package of economic sanctions against Russia. He also said that if Moscow sent troops in, it would be a “painful, violent and bloody business – and I think it’s very important that people in Russia understand that this could be a new Chechnya”. If forced, Johnson said he believed the Ukrainians “will fight” and they should “understand that in the Kremlin”. He added: “The UK is in the lead in creating that package of economic sanctions, helping to stiffen the resistance of our Ukrainian friends with defensive weaponry that we’re supplying and making it clear that we stand fully foursquare with the people of Ukraine.” Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko, earlier condemned Nato’s build-up of soldiers, saying the military alliance was “demonising Russia” in order to “justify military activity on [Nato’s] eastern flank”. “The language of Nato is the language of threats and military pressure,” he said in remarks published by Russian media. “This is nothing new.”",News/World news,Johnson warns of painful and violent Ukraine ‘lightning war’ ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/24/johnson-warns-of-painful-and-violent-ukraine-lightning-war
1/24/2022,"The official memorial of Auschwitz, the largest Nazi concentration camp in which more than 1 million people were murdered, has accused the prominent anti-vaxxer Robert F Kennedy Jr of “moral and intellectual decay”, after he compared vaccine mandates to laws in Hitler’s Germany and invoked the name of Anne Frank.  The Auschwitz Memorial and Museum responded swiftly to remarks made at an anti-vaccine mandate rally in Washington DC on Sunday. In a tweet, the institution criticized Kennedy for “exploiting the tragedy of people who suffered, were humiliated, tortured and murdered by the totalitarian regime of Nazi Germany – including children like Anne Frank”. To do so during a debate about vaccines and how to deal with the coronavirus pandemic was a “sad symptom of moral and intellectual decay”, the memorial said. Kennedy made his public reputation as an environmentalist but in recent years has used his legendary family name to back conspiracy theories and oppose vaccines. At the “Defeat the Mandates” march on Sunday, which was staged by his organization Children’s Health Defense Fund, he likened government efforts to contain Covid-19 to the Holocaust. “Even in Hitler’s Germany you could cross the Alps into Switzerland, you could hide in an attic like Anne Frank did,” he said. Frank, who wrote a diary chronicling how she hid from the Nazis for two years before being arrested by the Gestapo in 1944 and sent to Auschwitz, was in fact apprehended not in Germany but in Amsterdam. She died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945. Kennedy also rehashed conspiracy theories about the Microsoft founder and vaccine advocate Bill Gates and 5G, the mobile technology which Kennedy said was designed to “control our behaviour”. He also invoked his father, the attorney general and New York senator Robert Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1968 as he was making a bid for the US presidency. “I’ve visited 1962 East Germany with my father,” Kennedy Jr told the anti-vaxxer crowd, “and met people who had climbed the [Berlin] Wall and escaped. It was possible. Today the mechanisms are being put in place where none of us can run and none of us can hide.” Survivors of the Holocaust also lamented Kennedy’s words. Lucy Lipiner, 88, who fled the Nazis from Poland when she was six, said: “Robert Kennedy Jr is so ignorant. I’m speechless.” She added: “Running/hiding in the Holocaust was rare, almost impossible. I’m lucky to have survived. Anne Frank didn’t.”",News/US news,"Robert F Kennedy Jr ‘exploited tragedy’ of Nazism in anti-vax speech, says Auschwitz memorial",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/24/robert-f-kennedy-jr-anti-vax-speech-anne-frank-auschwitz-memorial
1/24/2022,"Britain will send a team of 50 athletes to the Winter Olympics that will be more competitive in more disciplines than ever before, Team GB’s chef de mission has predicted. Georgina Harland said athletes were ready to write a new chapter in the country’s history and challenge established alpine countries in the pursuit of a record Winter Games haul in Beijing.  Harland said: “We are delighted to welcome the 50 athletes who will make up the team at Beijing 2022 and feel these athletes have the opportunity to not only challenge established winter nations but compete with the success we enjoyed at both Sochi and Pyeongchang.” “This is an exciting new chapter for British winter sport with a number of new names for the British public to enjoy and get behind and with athletes who have experienced four Olympic Winter Games, they will undoubtedly be a great support to the emerging talent. Team GB’s record medal success at a Winter Olympics is five, achieved in Sochi and Pyeongchang, however the hope among insiders is that they will be at the top end of their three to seven medal target for Beijing. “It promises to be a fantastic Olympics and Team GB will go into the Beijing Games as one of the best prepared teams and one that will be competitive across more disciplines than ever before,” added Harland. On Monday the British Olympic Association announced its 50th and final athlete for the Games, the speed skater Ellia Smeding, who will compete in the 1,000m and 1500m in Beijing. The 23-year-old will join her partner, Cornelius Kersten, as the first British long-track speed skaters to compete at an Olympics for 30 years, after she set national records in the 500m, 1,000m and 1500m last month. The Team GB squad includes three returning bronze medallists – Izzy Atkin in slopestyle, Laura Deas in skeleton and Eve Muirhead in curling. There are also high hopes for a strong team that includes alpine skier Dave Ryding, who won his first World Cup race on Saturday and world champion snowboarder Charlotte Bankes. The athletes will be departing the UK over the next 10 days.

1/24/2022,"Aviva Investors, an important UK asset manager, has put the directors of 1,500 companies on notice that it is willing to seek their removal if they fail to show enough urgency in tackling issues including the climate crisis and human rights. The firm said the way it votes on the re-election of company board members in the upcoming AGM season would be heavily influenced by its four key stewardship priorities for the year, which also include biodiversity and executive pay.  In its annual letter to 1,500 companies in 30 countries including the UK, Aviva Investors urged companies to develop their own biodiversity action plans, publicly state their commitment to human rights, with appropriate due diligence, and ensure that executive pay plans – particularly bonuses – are linked to its four stewardship priorities. Aviva Investors, which manages £262bn in assets including savings and pensions, and is a big shareholder in many leading companies, said its strong message was part of efforts to create a more sustainable, inclusive and low-carbon future. “We acknowledge the magnitude of many of these challenges and will evaluate companies on the strength of their commitments and their ability to demonstrate progress over time,” the asset manager said. “However, we will hold boards and individual directors accountable where the pace of change does not reflect the urgency required.” Last year, Aviva’s concerns over a lack of ethnic diversity on company boards – which was one of its stewardship priorities in 2021 – led to votes against directors at 137 companies. It opposed board members at 85 companies because of human rights concerns, including at the American meat processing company Tyson Foods, which was accused of negligence towards its workers during the pandemic. Aviva also rejected 33% and 68% of executive pay proposals in the UK and US respectively, amid concerns over pay levels and the structure of remuneration plans. The Aviva Investors chief executive, Mark Versey, said that this year’s stewardship priorities were meant to “encourage companies to consider the whole picture of sustainability because this is how they will create the greatest return for shareholders, while helping to build a better future for society”. Aviva welcomed the promises some firms had made to change, including during the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow. However, Versey said “companies must now turn their pledges into concrete and measurable plans of delivery”. He added: “Our letter sets out clear expectations as to how they should do this, and what those plans must address across climate impact, biodiversity and human rights.” In terms of climate commitments, Aviva Investors said all companies should be developing credible climate transition plans and work towards having them officially verified by the science-based targets initiative.

1/24/2022,"The opening of Paris haute couture fashion week, trailed as a celebratory return to live catwalk shows, was overshadowed by the death of the fashion legend Manfred Thierry Mugler. The unexpected announcement of Mugler’s death at the age of 73 made a dramatic start to fashion’s most theatrical week. Haute couture produces showstopping, headline-grabbing gowns for the upcoming red carpet season and for the world’s most extravagant parties. The pedestrian business of hemlines, which other fashion weeks concern themselves with, has no place here. Couture week had been hailed as a cheerful post-pandemic celebration of live fashion, with twice as many physical catwalk shows scheduled as last season, but the news of Mugler’s death, which came just days after a Louis Vuitton show paid tribute to the late Virgil Abloh, moved the mood music dial to bittersweet.  Daniel Roseberry, the American creative director who over the past two years has plucked the Schiaparelli name out of fashion’s history books and put it back onto Vogue covers, paid homage to Mugler at his show. A recent visit to Thierry Mugler: Couturissime, a retrospective of the designer currently being staged in Paris, “made me realise how much I had absorbed directly from his work”, Roseberry said. “[Mugler’s] legacy in fashion today is so vibrant, in the way he created characters on the runway. This is very sad news. To be able to show today, in a space that is almost like a church, is an incredible honour.” The winter sunshine that flooded the Beaux-Arts splendour of the Petit Palais gallery added sublime dazzle to a show of foxy blacked-out curves accented by pieces of polished gold which are ornaments, rather than mere accessories. There was an hourglass gold metal corset, a handbag fashioned as a miniature sofa complete with ornamental legs, and earrings in the shape of dinosaur-sized molar teeth. Delicate gold sculptures bobbed in space around the models as they walked the catwalk, echoing the mobile sculptures of Alexander Calder. Previous incumbents to the Schiaparelli design job have struggled with a brand weighed down by its history, but Roseberry has brought it back to life not by trying to move away from surrealism but by leaning hard into it – specifically into an obsession with exaggerated body parts which connects 1930s avant garde art to Instagram’s obsession with filtered bodily perfection. There are no lobsters on Roseberry’s catwalk, but plenty of teeth, breasts, ears and toes. “Anytime that people see themselves reflected back in fashion – especially seeing the body reflected back – there is a visceral reaction to that,” the designer said after his show. In its idiosyncratic hot takes on the human body, the Schiaparelli collection emphasised how Thierry Mugler presaged contemporary fashion and pop culture. Mugler once said “I have always been fascinated by the most beautiful animal on the Earth: the human being”, and a preoccupation with the body shaped not just his catwalk shows, but all three of his careers. Mugler was a professional ballet dancer before he became a fashion designer, at which point he rejected the wispy lines of the ballerina in favour of exaggerated corsetry. Later, on parting company with his fashion house, he became a full-time bodybuilder. The extent to which Mugler’s point of view remains alive in fashion was also underscored by the front row presence of Kanye West at Schiaparelli, wearing a full black face covering which, while technically rendering him anonymous, has become an attention-grabbing signature look. With matching leather trousers, boots and jacket, West’s all-black silhouette evoked ex-wife Kim Kardashian’s Balenciaga look at the most recent Met Gala. Mugler was an industry maverick who broke rules in every category, putting a just-divorced Ivana Trump on his catwalk in 1991 and scoring his biggest commercial success not with a dress but with the best-selling fragrance, Angel, which has notes of melted milk chocolate. He continued to create one-off pieces long after bowing out of fashion in its business mode, and in 2019 dressed Kardashian in a latex gown intended to look as if she had just emerged from a dip in the ocean in a wet T-shirt. Roseberry pointed to clean, sculptural silhouettes as a direction for the upcoming red carpet season. Describing last year as “a kind of disco goddess sensibility” he said he was “tired of ballgowns, tired of pouffiness. I want to see some legs.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,Haute couture in the shadow of Thierry Mugler’s death,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/24/thierry-mugler-death-haute-couture-fashion-week
1/24/2022,"Show, don’t tell. It’s one of cinema’s cardinal rules – not that anyone told Colm Meaney’s compulsively questioning priest in David Beton’s laborious thriller, or the wounded gunman (True Blood’s Stephen Moyer) who staggers into his church with a yarn to spin. You have to be very gifted to successfully flout that rule, and writer-director Beton – also responsible for 2017’s The Hatton Garden Job, under the name Ronnie Thompson – can’t get his characters to transfix, even if they keep interest flickering intermittently. Meaney’s Father Peter is admirably stoic with a gun in his face. In fact, he soon turns the tables on the interloper, Victor, who he implores to own up to whatever sins have led to him bleeding from the stomach in the nave. But while Victor recounts his saga – something about his dead wife and his estrangement from his teenage daughter – another bleeding intruder, Willow (Clare-Hope Ashitey, little seen since Children of Men), is lurking in a wardrobe in Father Peter’s study. When she finally emerges, brandishing a police badge, she upends everything Victor has been saying.  But while she is telling it, and Victor retorts, this pulpy braiding of corrupt and in-deep-cover cops feels arbitrary and inconsequential. Despite all three leads pulling their weight, the scenes only build up tepid dramatic heat and offer no real Rashomon-style perspective shifts. Father Peter has his own story, feeding into the theme of failed fathers and setting up an effective final twist. For all the rueful mood Beton tries to nurture, there’s something inert about Confession. The budget presumably prohibited it, but it is what flashbacks were invented for.  Confession is available on digital platforms on 31 January.",Arts/Film,"Confession review – priest, cop and bloodied gunman face off in church thriller",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/24/confession-review-colm-meaney
1/24/2022,"A metal detectorist who gave up his hobby when he started a family, only to return to it when his children were old enough to nag him into taking them out detecting with him, has been rewarded with one of the most extraordinary finds – a lovely example of England’s oldest gold coin, which has sold for a record-breaking £648,000 at auction. Michael Leigh-Mallory, 52, found the Henry III gold penny buried 10cm deep on farmland in the Devon village of Hemyock shortly after taking up his old hobby again. Not realising what it was, he posted a picture of the coin on social media, where it was spotted by the auctioneers Spink in London.  He will split the proceeds of the find with the landowner and plans to use his windfall to help fund the future education of his children, history-loving 13-year-old Emily, who has ambitions of studying archaeology at university, and Harry, 10. On Monday Leigh-Mallory made a pilgrimage to Henry III’s tomb in Westminster Abbey to pay his respects and offer thanks for his good fortune. “It is quite surreal really,” he said. “I’m just a normal guy who lives in Devon with his family, so this really is a life-changing sum of money which will go towards their futures. “Emily and Harry are very much a part of this story. I used to be a keen metal detectorist but once I had a family the detector ended up getting buried in a cupboard. One day my wife said to me: ‘You realise you promised you’d take the kids metal detecting.’ So, I said: ‘Right, kids, we’re going detecting.’ We found an Elizabethan coin, which they were so excited by. It really ignited my passion so I invested in a new detector. “The day after it arrived I went out into this field. It was a bright, sunny day and within 15 minutes I found the coin. I knew it was gold but I had no idea how important it was.” Leigh-Mallory, a retired ecologist from Cullompton, added: “Both of my kids are very passionate about history. Emily has joined a local archaeology society and may study it at university, so the money could go towards that. “Had it not been for a promise I made to my children to go out searching, I do not believe this gold coin would ever have been found. The fine margin between discovery and loss makes this result all the more remarkable. I really owe it to them for having found the coin in the first place, as they were my inspiration to go out prospecting.” The penny found by Leigh-Mallory was struck in about 1257 by the king’s goldsmith, William of Gloucester, with precious metal imported from north Africa. Featuring a portrait of the bearded and crowned Henry III on his throne, around 52,000 of the coins were minted. It became apparent they were financially unviable because the value of the coin was less than its weight in gold and almost all were melted down. Leigh-Mallory’s is only the eighth known example. The coin he found is thought to have belonged to John de Hyden, a former lord of the manor. Six months before the coin was introduced, De Hyden paid 120 grams of gold to the king to avoid jury service and public office. He later served in a military campaign in Wales, for which he may have received some of the gold pennies. Gregory Edmund, a senior numismatist at Spink, said: “Not only does this stand as the most valuable single coin find in British history, but also the most valuable medieval English coin ever sold at auction.” It achieved a hammer price of £540,000, with extra fees taking the final figure to £648,000. Edmund said: “It was bought by an anonymous private collector in the United Kingdom who intends to place the coin on loan to a public institution or museum. “The sale itself was very unusual because the buyer was there to bid in person. He loved that this fascinating story had unraveled from a chance discovery by a metal detector.”",News/UK news,"‘I owe it to the kids’: coin found by detectorist dad sold for £648,000",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/24/devon-detectorist-13th-century-gold-coin-sold
1/24/2022,"It was supposed to be one of those Sunday night spectacles that define a Serie A season. Milan, second in the table and needing a win to keep pace in the title race, up against Juventus, fifth and fighting for their Champions League lives. Two of the giants of Italian football squaring off at San Siro, the country’s grandest arena. Juventus were yet to beat any of the teams ahead of them in the table – Milan, Inter, Napoli or Atalanta. But their manager, Massimiliano Allegri, had never lost in 18 career meetings with his Rossonero counterpart Stefano Pioli. This was an occasion for someone to rewrite the narratives. Instead, all the pens ran dry.  There is barely a tale to recount about the football match itself. Juventus went the full 90 minutes without taking a shot on target. The last time that happened to them in a game against Milan was March 2011, with Alessandro Matri up front and Luigi Delneri in the dugout. They finished that season seventh. Milan pushed harder, but still never looked much like scoring. Rafael Leão forced Wojciech Szczęsny to get down quickly when he dug out a shot between four defenders on the edge of the box. Olivier Giroud sent a header straight at the keeper from near the penalty spot. That was as close as either team came to breaking the goalless stalemate. Perhaps things might have gone differently if Zlatan Ibrahimovic had not been forced off for Milan after 28 minutes with an achilles injury. It was he who laid the ball off to Leão for the first of those opportunities, redirecting a pass from Junior Messias into the path of their Portuguese teammate. Even before the Swede’s exit, however, this felt like a diminished spectacle: a Broadway show with a cast full of understudies, performed on a crumbling stage in an almost-empty theatre. Milan were missing the spine of their team, with Fikayo Tomori and Simon Kjaer injured, Franck Kessié away at the Africa Cup of Nations and Ismaël Bennacer returning too late to be considered for the starting XI. Juventus arrived without Leonardo Bonucci or Federico Chiesa. The players who did line up for kick-off found the pitch in a shocking state. Keeping the grass green at San Siro has been a struggle ever since the stadium’s third tier was added – blocking out sunlight – but its condition on Sunday was especially poor. This was the sixth game at San Siro in 12 days. Inter had hosted Venezia on the same turf barely 24 hours before. New Covid regulations, meanwhile, had capped the attendance at just 5,000 fans. That restriction applied across all Serie A games but inevitably was felt most keenly at a venue with more than 70,000 empty seats. Neither manager sought to make alibis. Although Pioli suggested that the heavy pitch made attacking harder, often requiring players to take an extra touch or play an extra pass, he stressed that his team should have been more precise. He framed the draw as an acceptable result, but said his “glass is half empty because of [last Monday’s] loss to Spezia.” You could not blame him for lingering on that defeat. Milan had themselves to blame for missing a hatful of chances but still ought to have taken all three points when Junior Messias swept the ball home in injury time. His goal was cancelled out by a premature whistle from the referee Marco Serra, and Spezia snatched a winner moments later. During an interview for the Observer, Pioli said he was proud of his players’ mature reaction, declining to scapegoat the referee for making a mistake. Yet regret plainly remains. By the end of Sunday night, his team had fallen four points behind Inter – who also have a game in hand. The derby that awaits in Serie A’s next round after the international pause might be make-or-break now for Milan’s hopes of sustaining a title push. Juventus’s sights are set lower. A win on Sunday would have vaulted them ahead of Atalanta into fourth place, but Allegri suggested he was happy just to keep pace for now with the Bergamo club, who drew 0-0 at Lazio on Saturday. His glass, he said, was “completely full”. The Bianconeri have tightened up after a disastrous start to the season, extending their unbeaten run to nine games and recording their eighth clean sheet in the last 12. Restoring the defensive solidity of his previous tenures has been a priority for Allegri. One wonders how many of the club’s supporters, however, shared his description of Sunday’s game as “beautiful”. Allegri also celebrated the fact that his team had “kept the gap to Milan at seven points”, a sentiment that felt alien to hear from a Juventus manager when theirs is the team trailing. The Old Lady’s sights have fallen dramatically over the past 18 months. To achieve such a robust defensive performance with the maligned Daniele Rugani at centre-back brought additional satisfaction, even if the player responded to Allegri’s praise of his timing and positioning at full-time by saying that “these are fundamentals I picked up from a few managers, in particular [Maurizio] Sarri.” Verona 2-1 Bologna, Lazio 0-0 Atalanta, Internazionale 2-1 Venezia, Genoa 0-0 Udinese, Milan 0-0 Juventus, Empoli 2-4 Roma, Torino 1-1 Sassuolo, Spezia 1-0 Sampdoria, Napoli 4-1 Salernitana, Cagliari 1-1 Fiorentina There is time yet for Juventus to upgrade their attack in this transfer window. The club’s interest in Dusan Vlahovic is well-known but up until recently the suggestion had always been that Juventus would prefer to sign him in the summer. The total absence of attacking threat on Sunday might help to persuade the club of the need to make something happen sooner, even at a higher price point. That much, though, is speculation. Milan, too, are exploring options to strengthen their squad over the next few days but if nothing else they know that the playing conditions at San Siro ought to be better by the time they face Inter – with the pitch being fully re-laid.

Composition as an act of defiance or self-definition in the face of the ultimate obscenity was the subject of the BBC Symphony Orchestra’s Total Immersion: Music for the End of Time, a day of concerts, films and talks about music written in the ghettos and camps of Nazi-occupied Europe. The programme included not only works from Theresienstadt, but also music by the communist Erwin Schulhoff, who died of tuberculosis in Wülzburg prison in 1942, and Messiaen’s Quartet for the End of Time, written in 1941 when Messiaen was a prisoner of war in Görlitz. Alpesh Chauhan conducted the BBC Symphony Orchestra in a lunchtime concert, which placed Schulhoff’s Fifth Symphony, raging against the Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia, alongside Hans Krása’s nervously ironic Overture for Small Orchestra and Pavel Haas’s taut Study for String Orchestra, both written for the Theresienstadt Orchestra. Players from the BBCSO under Josep Pons, also formed the chamber orchestra for the evening performance of Ullmann’s opera Der Kaiser von Atlantis, in an austere hard-hitting semi-staging by Kenneth Richardson, and sung by a superb ensemble cast. The opera’s bitter ironies and despairing laughter contrasted with Messiaen’s extraordinary Quartet, with its unswerving proclamation of faith amid the encroaching darkness, sensationally played by musicians from the Guildhall School.  Yet the day’s most powerful concert was given by the BBC Singers and Guildhall musicians at Milton Court in the afternoon. Devised by baritone Simon Wallfisch, it interwove choral works, chamber music and songs with a narration, spoken by Wallfisch himself and drawn from documents from Theresienstadt. A father addresses his baby son in his diary, the entries breaking off with the sudden news that the two are to be transported elsewhere. We were reminded that of the 15,000 children who passed through the camp, only 100 survived. The music embraced arrangements of traditional songs by Ullmann and Gideon Klein as well as Klein’s exquisite String Trio, and astonishing, savagely ironic cabaret numbers by Dieter Gogg. Not always easy to listen to, it was an unforgettable affirmation of the human spirit in the most appalling circumstances.  Alpesh Chauhan’s concert and Der Kaiser von Atlantis will be broadcast on BBC Radio 3 and BBC Sounds on 11 March.
