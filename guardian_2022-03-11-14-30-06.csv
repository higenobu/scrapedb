3/11/2022,"Russia is likely to expand its confrontation with the west by pressuring Serbia into undermining the independence of Kosovo and other western Balkan states, regional leaders have warned in interviews with the Guardian. They also called for the EU and Nato to speed up their approach to applications for membership from Balkans countries, and bolster defences against Russian interference. Kosovo’s prime minister, Albin Kurti, warned that “it is in the interest of the Russian Federation to have new battlegrounds because they do not want to go back to peace”. The country’s president, Vjosa Osmani, predicted that “Russia, by destabilising the western Balkans, will seek to destabilise the whole of the Europe” and said Moscow was using Serbia to endanger democratic values. Šefik Džaferović, the Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) member of Bosnia-Herzegovina’s tripartite presidency, warned that his country was particularly vulnerable to Russian meddling, as Milorad Dodik, the Serb member of the presidency who has close links to the Kremlin, is threatening to withdraw Bosnian Serb participation from the national army, judiciary and taxation system – in effect ripping up the Dayton peace treaty that ended the war in 1995. “Dodik is trying to take advantage of the fact that the attention of the west is focused on Ukraine,” Džaferović told the Guardian. “He is encouraged in his behaviour by Russia, which is always keen on showing that it can destabilise the soft underbelly of the EU and Nato. Western governments should consider this much more seriously and engage more actively and strongly in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the whole region.” “These are dark days for Europe and the whole world. We are witnessing something that is horrible. We saw a similar horror here in Bosnia-Herzegovina in the 1990s,” Džaferović said. Osmani said the appeasement of autocrats such as Vladimir Putin and the Serbian president, Alexsandar Vučić, had been shown not to work in Ukraine. She warned: “Russia is likely to use either the Baltics or the western Balkans – or both – to raise tensions and expand the crisis internationally.” Kurti said: “I fear that the longer the war lasts in Ukraine, the greater the chances of spillover in the western Balkans. And that is because it is in the interest of the Russian Federation to have new battlegrounds.” “Putin still considers Nato intervention in Kosovo as the most important recent international single event,” Kurti said. “He wants the state of Kosovo to fail in order to show that Nato success was temporary, just like in Iraq and Afghanistan.” Their remarks came as the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, started a tour of the western Balkans including Kosovo, saying she was determined to send a message that Europe was not going to let the region fall under the influence of Russia. Kosovo, Albania, North Macedonia and Montenegro have all redoubled their calls for serious progress to be made on stalled applications to join Nato and the EU. Kosovo is also applying to join the Council of Europe – from which Russia is resigning. Osmani said: “Everything we see in Ukraine brings back memories of the heavy price we had to pay to achieve our freedom. So we may be a small country, but we hope we have a big voice to say there is no price too high to defend democracy.” Kurti and Osmani, members of different parties but partners in government, face a particular hurdle, since four EU countries have yet to recognise Kosovo. Kosovo declared its independence in 2008, nearly a decade after a bloody liberation struggle that saw the Nato air force bomb Belgrade as the alliance came close to a direct confrontation with Russia – something it has not been prepared to do in Ukraine. Serbia, itself an aspirant to EU membership, is performing a delicate balancing act between its European aspirations and close cultural and political ties with Russia. Earlier this month, thousands of people waved Russian flags and pictures of Putin at a pro-Moscow demonstration after the invasion of Ukraine. Vučić has repeatedly pointed out that the country abstained in the recent key vote at the UN general assembly, rather than support Russia. Osmani pointed out: “Belgrade is the only place in Europe with pro-Putin protests, with politicians saying they support the aggression. They are the only country in Europe that has not aligned itself with EU sanctions. Quite the opposite – they have increased the number of flights from Belgrade to Russia.” Kurti said: “Neutrality is siding with the aggressor. It is the most indecent thing you can do. You cannot be neutral between fire and firefighter.” Kurti said that Serbia spends almost 3% of its GDP on military equipment and training – most of which comes from Russia. “They have 14 MiG-29 fighter jets, eight of them donations from Belarus and six from the Russian Federation – and you know, donations from the Russian Federation come with a price tag.”",News/World news,"Russia may pressure Serbia to undermine western Balkans, leaders warn",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/russia-may-pressure-serbia-to-undermine-western-balkans-leaders-warn

3/11/2022,"Many an insult has been hurled at Vladimir Putin since he invaded Ukraine a fortnight ago, causing chaos, heartbreak and death. A bloodstained aggressor. A 21st-century Stalin. A total fucking dickhead. Beelzebub. “Look at the face of Putin. You will see the devil,” one US commentator opined on Wednesday as a maternity hospital was bombed in the city of Mariupol. But for the Venezuelan pundit Alberto Aranguibel, Putin’s 24 February invasion was “la guerra necesaria” – the necessary war. The Chinese academic Wang Shuo saw it as “a US-created crisis”. “The strategic selfishness of the US has brought more disasters to the world,” Wang grumbled on Wednesday in the state-run Global Times, blaming Washington’s “selfish and short-sighted action” for plunging Ukraine into war. And for the editorial board at Mexico’s La Jornada newspaper, it was time to abandon the unhelpful fantasy that Putin’s “ambition and wickedness” was the sole culprit and face “the difficult truth” of how Nato’s eastward push had paved the way for disaster. “The west’s horror at Putin’s actions should be placed in the context of the shameful history of western powers’ involvement in illegal wars,” said an article in the prominent South African newspaper the Daily Maverick, pondering South Africa’s perceived neutral position on the war. “Has the west’s response to the Ukraine invasion been hypocritical? Unequivocally: yes,” the author argued, before also condemning Putin’s “unjustifiable and illegal onslaught on a sovereign state”. Much of the coverage exploring western hypocrisy has come from predictable quarters: state-run media outlets in authoritarian Russia allies such as Venezuela, North Korea, Syria, Cuba and China, where pro-regime journalists have largely shunned the word “invasion”. “When will they sanction the US for its crimes and invasions?” Telesur’s Venezuela correspondent, Madelein García, wondered this week after Joe Biden announced a ban on Russian oil imports. The Chavista commentator Aranguibel painted Putin not as an aggressor but the victim of “the most brutal and intense demonisation campaign ever seen”. “[The campaign is] perhaps only comparable to the one that’s been waged against president Nicolás Maduro for at least a decade,” Aranguibel wrote in Últimas Noticias, a pro-government tabloid, although the anti-US tone in Venezuela’s pro-regime media appeared to soften after talks with Biden officials last Saturday. China’s official news agency, Xinhua, calls the conflict “the Ukraine situation”. while North Korea’s state-run KCNA agency has called western sanctions an “abuse of power”. “The root cause of the Ukraine crisis totally lies in the hegemonic policy of the US and the west, which enforce themselves in high-handedness and abuse of power against other countries,” KCNA quoted a foreign ministry official as saying. In Taipei, meanwhile, media outlets pondered if Russia’s actions set a worrying precedent for Taiwan, where the threat of an invasion by China looms large. Headlines asked: “Ukraine today, Taiwan tomorrow?” Granma, the mouthpiece for Cuba’s Communist party, slammed the “Yankee empire’s ruthless campaign” against Russia while downplaying the conflict as a “desacuerdo” (disagreement) between Moscow and Kyiv. In Syria, state media have been fully behind Bashar al-Assad, who has backed Putin’s war from the outset after Russia helped him secure his own position in Syria over the last seven years. But criticism of western double standards has not been limited to state media outlets in Russian allies. An opinion article in the South African daily the Mail & Guardian called the conflict “soaked in contradictions”, criticising western media coverage and government responses that appeared to frame the war in Ukraine as worse than other conflicts outside Europe. “Even as we deplore the violence and the loss of life in Ukraine resulting from the Russian intervention … it is valuable to step back and look at how the rest of the world may perceive this conflict,” it said. “Fear of domination, potential enemies spur Russia’s invasion,” read a headline in the Guardian in Nigeria, reflecting widely held beliefs about perceived Nato expansionist aims in Europe being partially to blame. Yan Boechat, a Brazilian journalist who is reporting on the humanitarian crisis from Kyiv, scoffed at the “cynical, hypocritical” tears being shed by the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, over victims of the Ukraine conflict, given the carnage his country’s military had caused in Iraq. “Under Obama, the US was just as cruel in Mosul as Putin. Nobody was left to mourn the dead. US planes killed them all,” Boechat tweeted, recalling how he had stumbled over body parts while reporting from the devastated Iraqi city six months after the war there. “Unfortunately, cruelty, barbarity and injustice aren’t unique to Putin and the Russians,” the Brazilian journalist concluded. “Victims are mourned depending on the aggressor. [But] they are all victims: civilians who are Ukrainian, Iraqi, Syrian, Afghan.”",News/World news,‘A necessary war’: reporting on the Ukraine ‘disagreement’ outside the west,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/a-necessary-war-reporting-on-the-ukraine-disagreement-outside-the-west
