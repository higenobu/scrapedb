1/15/2022,"On a Thursday Zoom call with progressive activists, Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said that the upcoming hearings by the Jan. 6 select committee probing the riot at the U.S. Capitol staged by supporters of former President Donald Trump will “blow the roof off the House.” “We are going to do everything we can to subpoena all the information we need and to enforce our subpoenas. But even if we don’t get every last person in there, we are going to have hearings that I believe will be compared to the Watergate hearings, because they are going to blow the roof off the House in terms of explaining to America what actually happened in the attack on our democracy,” Raskin, who sits on the select committee, told an audience of approximately 40,000 people who watched his remarks on Facebook.  While former Trump administration figures and supporters have defied subpoenas for information and testimony, Raskin said the committee had spoken with more than 400 witnesses to date who have already laid the groundwork for explosive hearings.  “I hope everybody will watch and I hope everybody will discuss it and then it will lead to a report that, I hope again, will be a game changer in terms of American history,” Raskin said.  In response to questions about holding Trump personally accountable for pushing the disproven claim that he lost the 2020 presidential election due to voter fraud, which served as the motivation for the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, Raskin promised “a reckoning.” “But you know, the guy’s a walking crime wave, and he has committed crimes all over the country, including sexual harassment and assault on a lot of people. There’s bank fraud and there’s real estate fraud and there’s tax fraud,” Raskin said.  “And there are prosecutors all over the country, looking at all that stuff. I don’t want us to fetishize Donald Trump that much — he will meet you know, his maker, one place or another, there will be accountability and a reckoning with the law.” The committee has already made headlines by releasing text messages it has obtained that it says show that Fox News host Sean Hannity “had advance knowledge regarding President Trump’s and his legal team’s planning for January 6th,” and that Ivanka Trump had urged her father to stop the violence at the Capitol.  The committee also said this week that it had interviewed Trump supporter Ray Epps and released a statement that attempted to discredit the assertion made by some conservatives that he was acting as an FBI agent or informant when encouraging people to enter the Capitol. Epps appeared on the FBI's Most Wanted list shortly after the Jan. 6 riot, only to be later removed, a fact that some Republicans say points to his involvement with the FBI.  “I’m not certain the FBI is totally competent with everything, but I’m totally certain that they would not be so incompetent as to put their own agent on the most-wanted list,” Rep. Adam Kinzinger, one of two Republicans serving on the committee, told Yahoo News.  The Jan. 6 select committee has been conducting its investigation for nearly seven months, and plans to hold televised primetime hearings to lay out its findings in the coming months. Raskin said he understood that many Republicans were simply trying to “run out the clock” on the investigation until the midterm elections, when many political observers expect the Democrats to lose control of the House and, as a result, the Jan. 6 committee.  For now, though, Raskin, who served as a manager during Trump's second impeachment, sounded confident that the hearings that were soon to commence would have an impact.  “This is the most bipartisan committee I’ve ever been on, with a great Democratic chair and a great Republican vice chair and what I see is constitutional patriots working every single day and every single evening to get the truth out to the American people before it’s too late.”",Politics/Yahoo News,"Jan. 6 hearings 'are going to blow the roof off the House,' Raskin says",https://news.yahoo.com/jan-6-hearings-are-going-to-blow-the-roof-off-the-house-rep-raskin-says-221500327.html
1/15/2022,"Former Chiefs defensive tackle Saousoalii Siavii was found dead Thursday afternoon in a Leavenworth prison as he awaited trial on federal criminal charges related to drug trafficking and illegal firearm possession. Siavii, 43, was found unresponsive at the U.S. Penitentiary at Leavenworth around 2:35 p.m, Anna Armijo, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, said in a statement. He was taken by prison staff to an area hospital and pronounced dead there. Few details were immediately disclosed about the circumstances surrounding the death. Armijo said no staff or other inmates were injured and “at no time was the public in danger.” Siavii appeared in 26 games with the Chiefs in 2004-05 but never made a start. He later played for the Dallas Cowboys and the Seattle Seahawks. Before the NFL, Siavii played for the University of Oregon. On Dec. 17, Siavii was moved to the medium-security prison. He was first charged in August 2019 with illegal firearms possession after he was arrested during a struggle with police officers. Siavii was later charged as part of a drug trafficking conspiracy in the Western District of Missouri.

1/15/2022,"By Nancy Lapid Jan 14 (Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review. Many people could still be infectious after 5-day quarantine After a five-day quarantine, about a third of people infected with SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, might still be infectious, according to new data. PCR tests detect virus particles but cannot tell whether they are infectious or merely inactive remnants. For a study using samples obtained from March through November 2020, researchers used a new test. In sequential samples from 176 people with positive PCR tests, they looked for genetic material that the virus produces when it is actively making copies of itself and is still transmissible. ""At five days, 30 percent of people still exhibited clinically relevant levels of potentially active virus,"" said study leader Lorna Harries of the University of Exeter Medical School in England. After a 10-day quarantine, one in 10 people might still be infectious, her team reported on Thursday in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(21)01206-6/fulltext. Some people retained these levels for up to 68 days, the researchers said. ""There was nothing clinically remarkable about these people, which means we wouldn't be able to predict who they are,"" Harries said in a news release. The study was conducted before the Delta and Omicron coronavirus variants began circulating last year. The researchers intend to conduct larger trials to confirm their findings. In the meantime, they suggest, in facilities ""where onward transmission would be especially problematic, it may be prudent to obtain molecular evidence of remission to prevent ongoing transmission."" Vapers risk more symptoms from COVID-19 E-cigarette users infected with the coronavirus may be more likely than infected non-vapers to experience COVID-19 symptoms, according to research published in the Journal of Primary Care & Community Health https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/21501319211062672. The researchers compared 289 vapers with 1,445 people of similar age and gender who neither vaped nor smoked tobacco, all of whom had tested positive for the coronavirus on PCR tests. Compared to infected non-vapers and after accounting for participants' other risk factors, infected vapers experienced higher rates of chest pain or tightness (16% versus 10%), chills (25% versus 19%), body aches (39% versus 32%), headaches (49% versus 41%), problems with smell and taste (37% versus 30%), nausea/vomiting/abdominal pain (16% versus 10%), diarrhea (16% versus 10%) and light-headedness (16% versus 9%). ""Our research was not designed to test whether e-cigarette use increases the risk of acquiring COVID infection, but it clearly indicates that symptom burden in patients with COVID-19 who vape is greater than in those who do not vape,"" study co-author Dr. Robert Vassallo of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said in a news release. The inflammation caused by the coronavirus and the inflammation induced by vaping may combine to worsen the likelihood of inflammation throughout the body, with a resulting increase in symptoms, Vassallo and his colleagues suggested. Experimental drug targets COVID-19 from two angles An experimental drug originally being developed to treat influenza is showing promise against SARS-CoV-2 and might defend against COVID-19 from two different directions, researchers said. The drug, called zapnometinib or ATR-002, could potentially curb the proliferation of the virus in cells and also reduce the exaggerated immune response that contributes to critical illness in severe cases of COVID-19, test tube experiments indicated. The data, published on Thursday in the journal Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00018-021-04085-1, provided the basis on which the German Institute of Drugs and Medicinal Products gave manufacturer Atriva Therapeutics its approval for the drug to be tested in people. This marks the first time any drug has been shown to have a dual action against COVID-19, study co-author Stephan Ludwig of the University of Muenster said in a news release. ""Positive results from the still-ongoing clinical study in humans might already lead to an emergency approval this year,"" Ludwig said.

1/15/2022,"By Eric M. Johnson    SEATTLE (Reuters) -Boeing Co executive Michael Teal, a veteran top engineer on its 777X and 737 MAX programs, is set to retire, according to a company memo seen by Reuters on Friday.    Teal, a 35-year Boeing veteran, held various engineering leadership roles including vice president and chief project engineer on the 777X, 747-8 Freighter and 737 programs. His long-planned retirement date is April 1, the memo said.    Teal was a vice president and chief project engineer during development of the 737 MAX, signing of on the jet's technical configuration. The plane was grounded for nearly two years starting in 2019 after two fatal crashes.    David Loffing, who has held engineering roles on several programs including the 747, NMA and 737, has been named as vice president 777X chief project engineer, the memo said.    The 777X program has been hobbled for years by certification problems and weak demand for long-haul jets.    The 737 MAX was approved to return to service in late 2020.    Teal was among a number of Boeing executives who testified at U.S. Congress during an investigation into a flawed flight control system known as MCAS linked to the 737 MAX crashes.    Teal and Keith Leverkuhn, the vice president in charge of the overall 737 MAX development program, defended the jet's development, and acknowledged flawed assumptions on how the pilots would react to the problems they encountered during the crash flights.    Teal also told investigators from the U.S. House transportation committee that he was unaware MCAS could activate repeatedly.    Boeing said later that Teal and Leverkuhn, who has retired, supervised hundreds of engineers and could not have been involved in every design decision.    (Reporting by Eric M.
