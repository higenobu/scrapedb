While the debt forgiveness will come as a relief to those who qualify, the number represents only 0.26% of the 43.4 million Americans burdened by federal student loan debt.

The president said he will either extend the moratorium, which has been in place since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, or do some sort of debt cancellation before then. The White House has been looking into whether Biden has the legal authority to forgive student loan debt through executive action. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday that the president was considering limiting his student loan forgiveness program to Americans earning less than $125,000 a year. Forgiveness of $10,000 per borrower would clear loans for 15 million borrowers.
