3/29/2022,"Boris Johnson should resign if he is fined by the Metropolitan police for lockdown breaches, despite the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Labour has said, after the Guardian revealed the first tranche of fines are expected to be issued imminently. It is understood the Met is expected to issue about 20 fines on Tuesday related to the most straightforward cases, though more are expected to follow. A source said the fines would probably be imposed on “low-hanging fruit” – an indication that Boris Johnson is unlikely to be among them, as he has denied breaking the law. Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said Johnson should resign if he were fined and so should his chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who has also been issued with a police questionnaire about lockdown gatherings. Asked if it was the right moment to trigger a leadership contest, Rayner said: “I think it’s important the support that we’ve given to the Ukrainian people, and we’ve been very clear in supporting the government in that and I think that’s a very serious situation and that it’s right that we’ve been united on that. “But that doesn’t negate the prime minister from lying to the British public and if he thinks it does then he’s sadly mistaken.” She said Johnson had compounded the seriousness by potentially misleading the House of Commons. “There’s breaking the rules, and then there’s trying to lie about it, because that makes it even worse, because the British public have to have faith,” she said. “I think, to be honest, if the prime minister said at the time, OK, there was a gathering, I was at this party, I probably shouldn’t have been there, hold my hands up. But he said there was no parties. “Then he says, ‘I didn’t realise it was party,’ when it was found out that he was actually there. So it shows a pattern of behaviour where the prime minister is not telling the truth to the British public. That’s very serious.” Two months ago the force began examining material from the Whitehall inquiry carried out by the senior civil servant Sue Gray into multiple alleged breaches of Covid rules. The Met sent questionnaires to more than 100 members of staff and aides, including Boris Johnson and his wife, Carrie; the head of the civil service, Simon Case; and the prime minister’s former principal private secretary Martin Reynolds. Police are investigating 12 separate events in 2020 and 2021, six of which Johnson is said to have attended. Scotland Yard said it had obtained more than 300 photographs and 500 pages of documents showing what Gray’s inquiry believes to be potential rule-breaking. Images include photos taken at parties and those taken from security cameras showing when people entered and exited buildings. The education minister Will Quince said gatherings that took place across Downing Street and Whitehall during Covid restrictions “shouldn’t have happened” but declined to say Johnson should go if he broke the law. “I entirely understand why you asked that question. I understand the huge public interest,” he told Sky. “I completely understand the considerable upset caused – the events that took place shouldn’t have happened. “But I hope you’ll understand that both as an education minister, but more importantly, as there’s ongoing live Metropolitan police investigation, it’s just not appropriate that I comment.”",News/Politics,"Boris Johnson must resign if fined for breaching lockdown, says Labour",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/29/boris-johnson-lockdown-breach-fines-labour
3/29/2022,"The former federal attorney general, Christian Porter, has paid tribute to Peter Dutton and the Ten Network’s political editor, Peter van Onselen, for supporting him after he was accused of a historical rape allegation. In his final speech to parliament hours before Tuesday’s budget, Porter said in 2021 he had “experienced a mob of people so actually convinced in their own judgment that they didn’t need anything else other than their own judgment”. Porter announced in December 2021 he would not recontest his West Australian seat of Pearce at the upcoming federal election. Earlier in the year, he had identified himself as the subject of an ABC story alleging an unidentified cabinet minister had been accused of a January 1988 rape in a dossier sent to Scott Morrison and three other parliamentarians. Porter strenuously denied the allegations but moved to the backbench after launching a defamation action against the ABC and reporter Louise Milligan. In late May 2021, Porter agreed to discontinue the case after the ABC stated it did not intend to suggest Porter had committed the alleged offence and that it regretted that “some readers misinterpreted the article as an accusation of guilt against Mr Porter”. “I saw the real truth about how critical the protection of the rule of law is and how fragile and how every man and woman in this country should fight for those protections as if their lives depend on it,” Porter said in his valedictory speech on Tuesday. The former attorney general paid tribute to the “love and friendship” that kept him going. He said while some people “will join a mob and others will slink away [and] some will think they can harness in their own interest” he would never forget the support he received from the defence minister, Dutton, and Van Onselsen. “Peter van Onselen and Peter Dutton knowing the risks better than any two people could possibly know the risks, they stated plain public support for me while the mob was in its full fury,” Porter said. “I’ve got to say they were acts of courage that will stay with me for the rest of my life.” In the Australian newspaper in March last year, Janet Albrechtsen, along with Van Onselen – a longtime friend of Porter’s – published details from the dossier put together by friends of the alleged rape victim who killed herself in 2020. At the time, Van Onselen was criticised for comments made on the ABC’s Insiders program about his uneasiness with the allegation against Porter. “At a macro level, I couldn’t be happier that there’s a shift that has occurred and women are coming forward,” he said. “But when it’s someone you know and if they claim to be innocent, boy that’s a difficult issue.” Porter devoted much of his final speech on Tuesday to the subject of China – stating he was much more concerned about the risk posed by Beijing than when he entered parliament nine years ago. “Autocratic powers who’ve experienced massive economic growth and expansion almost invariably tend to push their political power to the edge of their strategic military capability. And in the simplest terms, our world’s capability, balance is changing radically,” he said. Porter said the Coalition’s view on China had changed significantly but Labor was yet to go through the same evolution. Porter also criticised Australia for “falling into this cycle” of being “preoccupied with the identity politics of every imaginable boutique type”. “At worst, there’s become this regularisation in the abandonment of fundamental foundational western principles. The things that have made us privileged – free speech, due process, free association – are too regularly … tossed aside. “Tossed aside when it becomes too hard in the daily news cycle to resist the demand to abandon them to produce some other outcome desired by the best organised and noisiest interest of the day.”",News/Australia news,Christian Porter thanks Peter Dutton and Peter van Onselen in farewell speech to parliament ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/29/christian-porter-thanks-peter-dutton-and-peter-van-onselen-in-farewell-speech-to-parliament
3/29/2022,"Members of Kumanjayi Walker’s family have said in submissions to the Northern Territory coroner that they weren’t consulted about the timing of the Warlpiri’s man’s inquest, raising concerns the current plan will limit their participation. Constable Zachary Rolfe shot Walker three times while trying to arrest him on 9 November 2019 in Yuendumu, about 300km from Alice Springs. A jury unanimously found Rolfe not guilty of murder and two alternative charges on 11 March this year after a six-week trial in the NT supreme court. Attention has now turned to the inquest into Walker’s death, with a directions hearing held in Darwin on Tuesday. Submissions made by the families of Walker’s father, mother, and partner say they are not satisfied with a plan for the inquest to run for three months starting in September. They say they would prefer it not be conducted in a single block as to do so would prevent them from participating in any “meaningful” way. The Walker, Robertson and Lane families submitted five reasons supporting the proposal to break the inquest into separate blocks, saying they were yet to receive financial assistance which would allow them to participate, and that the death and lengthy criminal trial had traumatised them. “Media attacks on Kumanjayi Walker’s character subsequent to the trial… have exacerbated their distress,” the submission reads. “To now expect these families to sit a further continuous three months, as currently scheduled, especially without a proper appreciation of this process, is an unfair burden on them.” The families submitted that the inquest should instead first establish the primary facts of the case, before acting NT coroner Elisabeth Armitage then asked for submissions from relevant parties – including the families – about whether further issues needed to be considered, or expert evidence was required. In their submission, the families said there were 11 issues which should be explored to determine the “primary facts” in the case. These included decisions made to send the heavily armed immediate response team, of which Rolfe was a member, to Yuendumu; the training and any disciplinary history of Rolfe; the response of the police and health authorities to the community after the shooting; the history of interactions between Walker and the justice and health systems; and actions by police immediately after the shooting. Armitage agreed on Tuesday to formally include the families as a party to the inquest, along with six other parties: the Brown family, representing Walker’s adopted mother; the NT police; NT health department; Rolfe; the North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency; and the Parumpurru Committee of Yuendumu Community. Dr Peggy Dwyer, counsel assisting the coroner, said the inquest into the Victoria police shooting of 15-year-old Tyler Cassidy served as a precedent for allowing “interest groups” such as the health department, NAAJA and Parumpurru Committee to become parties to a case. She said she was “very aware of the community’s concerns” as raised in their submissions and would continue to engage with their lawyers, but advised Armitage that issues about the duration of the inquest raised in those submissions should not be considered until a further directions hearing on 20 May. Dwyer said she planned to meet with members of Walker’s family before the next directions hearing and hoped their lawyers would help facilitate that. At almost the same time the directions hearing ended, the NT police released a statement confirming the Independent Commissioner Against Corruption was investigating its decision to charge constable Zachary Rolfe with Walker’s murder. “Northern Territory Police have been advised that the Independent Commissioner Against Corruption will investigate the process that led to the arrest and charging of Constable Zachary Rolfe,” the NT police said in a statement. “NT Police will cooperate fully with the inquiry. As the matter is now before the ICAC there will be no further comment.”",News/Australia news,Family of Kumanjayi Walker say they were not adequately consulted over inquest timing,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/29/family-of-kumanjayi-walker-say-they-were-not-adequately-consulted-over-inquest-timing
3/29/2022,"Last month, 15-year-old Jacob Sanders found himself stuck deep in the belly of a dark cave. He had stripped down to his underwear, his naked torso bleeding from scratches. And he was shivering from the cold. But he wasn’t afraid. His uncle, Calvin Sanders, and his dad were nearby, and they were confident they could get him out. In fact, they’d helped him into the tight spot, hoisting him through a small crack in the ceiling to push deeper into the Pacific north-west cave, further in than any human had ever been before. But now, without a boost or anything to push off of with his legs, he was struggling to squeeze back through the space, similar in size to the opening of a dog door, but lined with sharp, rough, lava-made basalt rock. “I first took off my hoodie to fit through,” Jacob explained on a recent video call from Washington state, where he lives. “I was covered in blood and scratches from the cave walls. And my belt loop got stuck. And I couldn’t really breathe. So I had to take my belt off. And then my pants got stuck, so I literally started to take off my pants and everything.” (Warning: do not watch the video below if you are claustrophobic.) Eventually, scratched up but smiling, Jacob made it back through to his family. The scene didn’t make it into a video on Caveman Hikes, their YouTube channel chronicling Jacob and Calvin’s often claustrophobia-inducing caving excursions, but it’s similar to the scenarios that have helped their videos go viral. In the video called “The worst claustrophobic caving you will ever see”, for example, Calvin, a 46-year-old military veteran and experienced outdoorsman, and a small team of expert cavers use a drill to chip away at a long passageway before wedging themselves in to access a larger cavern below. While the chipping makes it possible for Calvin to just barely squeeze through the passageway, it’s excruciating to watch. Gripping a GoPro camera on a selfie stick in a lightly bleeding hand, he can hardly move his head from left to right. At one point, his slightly larger colleague becomes stuck ahead of him and has to be pulled by his feet to free himself, chipping away at the rock to give himself slightly more room and make another attempt. Since Jacob is still growing, he’s able to wedge himself into even smaller spaces than most of the others. In another video, “The tightest cave squeeze ever recorded”, his uncle helps him into a 6in-by-10in hole headfirst; he calmly and expertly wriggles through to a large cavern on the other side. With a flashlight in hand, he joyfully runs up the sides of the cave walls, slapping the ceiling with the other hand and taking it in. Then he slithers back up through the hole, this time “Superman style”, with his hands and arms out front so his uncle can pull him back out. “That was awesome in there!” he exclaims, laughing. “That was so much fun!” Jacob and Calvin agreed that even if no one watched their YouTube videos, they’d still be exploring the hundreds of local underground lava tubes and tree casts of southern Washington and Oregon, created by past eruptions from nearby volcanoes such as Mount Saint Helens. They both grew up hiking, and sometimes their family chose caves over waterfalls to visit along the way. But after the Covid-19 pandemic hit, the infrequent hobby transformed into an obsession. “When I first went in caves, I was terrified,” Jacob admits, adding that initially, he would always let his uncle go first, just in case someone or something unpleasant was around the corner. But now, that uncertainty about what’s ahead delivers a rush of excitement and wonder. “Caves will always surprise me,” he said. They always offer something new, dropping off or bending in unexpected ways, or containing fascinating geological formations or conditions. “Is it going to be wet? Is it going to be dry? Is it going to be cold, dirty, muddy, clean? Is it going to be, like, pretty or is it going to be super ugly, you know, like a crawly cave that’s all spiky?” For Calvin, it’s also a creative outlet, with the lighting, shooting and editing element thrown into the mix, as well as the opportunity to recite philosophical and often funny monologues about human nature. And he loves the psychological impact the videos have on the audience, who largely seem to be people who have claustrophobia and are engaging in a kind of exposure therapy. “This video made me press pause and go outside. TWICE,” writes one commenter. “I’ve been getting better though … I used to never be able to watch a whole video.” But after running into a few challenges on their own adventures, the pair decided to join their local “grotto”, a more formally organized chapter of the National Speleological Society, which started in the 1960s, long before technology like GPS. The librarian of the Oregon Grotto, which is a bit of a misnomer because it’s focused on southern Washington, is the official keeper of approximately 600 tightly protected cave maps that reveal the secret locations of every documented cave in the region. Because the maps can present a danger to inexperienced hikers and can seem inviting to vandals and litterers when they are made public, members of the grotto commit to keeping locations private. But it’s hardly a popular sport, said the grotto chairman, Ahrlin Bauman, who has appeared in a few of the videos on the channel. The group only has about 20 active members, he said, although there are more on the official mailing list. That’s because most excursions involve a lengthy hike of up to three miles through thick forest to site locations. Some caves require rope work, rappelling down into a cavern before hiking through a tunnel or wedging oneself through sharp, rugged passageways. The lava-made surfaces are so rough, a caver’s clothes and shoes last for just one or two excursions. But with members like Jacob and Calvin, there has been fresh energy to continue surveying caves and “pushing” them – looking more closely than the previous generation’s grotto did to see if caves are longer than originally thought, sometimes extending them by more than 1,000ft. Five years ago, Bauman said, he was exploring one of his favorite caves, Scott’s Cave, when he discovered a tree well that expanded into an erosional cave linked to a lava tube – a complete visual history of what lay below a lava eruption that happened 4,000 years ago. “You find something like that and that will reinvigorate you for a whole year,” he said. “You don’t have to find anything else.” The exhilaration of discovery, being somewhere that no one else has ever been, drives the cavers to keep pushing. This year, Bauman and the grotto plan to survey an additional 58,000ft, or about 10 miles, of caves. But the grotto isn’t the official administrator of the regional caves. They sometimes butt heads with the local forestry service, which doesn’t always want them to clean up vandalized caves and may not share their goal of keeping caves open, but private, with only those in the community aware of the locations. Caves are sometimes closed up. One of Bauman’s favorite spots, Dynamited Cave, was given the name after a group of kids became stuck in it decades ago. They had used a stretchy rope to rappel themselves down into the scenic cave, known for its uniquely orange walls that glow under LED lights. But when they let go of the rope, it bounced up 10ft out of their reach. Their parents found them and they were rescued, and the entrance to the cave was blown shut using explosives. But it was later reopened and remains so, partly because the local townspeople have developed a fondness for the cave. Calvin said the types of dangers audience members ask about – such as poor air quality – weren’t real risks. And you’d never meet dangerous animals – the only wildlife are insects and bats. But there is no cellphone service, and it can be cold. The temperature is nearly always hovering around 48F. After sweating heavily through an arduous passageway, it can feel frigid. Hypothermia is a real risk, and so is pure exhaustion from over-exertion. In 2009, John Edward Jones, a 26-year-old medical student, became stuck upside down while going head first into a passageway in Utah’s Nutty Putty Cave. Despite valiant efforts to rescue him over the course of 28 agonizing hours, Jones died there, leaving behind his pregnant wife and young child. His body was never retrieved, and the cave was sealed to prevent anyone from meeting the same fate. “Sometimes if I’m in a real tight spot, I’ll just lay there and relax,” Bauman said, adding that having a sense of calm and patience is one of the most important skills a caver can have. “A lot of times people panic and start wiggling and getting stuck even more. So I’ve learned that the more you try and fight it, the worse off you are.” He’s taken that calmness to the extreme, falling asleep in tight spots to rest his weary muscles and mind.",Sport/Sport,The extreme cavers: don’t watch these videos if you’re claustrophobic ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/29/caving-youtube-videos-jacob-sanders-calvin-sanders
3/29/2022,"This extraordinary comic is a collaboration between the neuroscientists Uta and Chris Frith, their writer son, Alex, and the artist and graphic novelist Daniel Locke. Have I ever read anything like it before? No, I’m certain that I haven’t. Each page is a visual delight: as colourful and as joyful as a book for children. It’s extremely easy to read and often very funny. And yet you finish it with your mind blown. Simply by virtue of the fact that it makes some pretty cutting-edge brain science seem almost straightforward, it subtly expands the world of the reader. Afterwards, I wasn’t only more attentive to my own thought processes (hmm, I thought, as I watched my hand reach for the bottle of sauvignon); armed with a bit more insight into the way people around me might be thinking, it’s possible that it may also have liberated me, just a little, from some all too human anxieties (what are they thinking? Doesn’t she like me? Why hasn’t he called me?). Uta Frith, an emeritus professor of cognitive development at the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience at University College London, and Chris Frith, emeritus professor at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging at University College London, are not only two of the most distinguished academics in Britain; they have also been married for 50 years. In Two Heads, their son sets out not only to tell their story – it opens with the couple, hand-in-hand, arriving at the cluttered, book-filled house in London where they’ve lived for more than three decades – but to enable them to explain to the layperson some aspects of their research (Uta is known for interest in autism and dyslexia; Chris once worked on the cognitive basis of schizophrenia). Along the way, they deliver many snappy explanations of how the brain works and some potted scientific history. The result is extremely rich, but never forced. It’s as if the brain is a fabulous gallery or museum, and they are simply taking us on an access-all-areas tour. It’s dizzying to consider the notion that your brain may make a decision before you are aware of this decision yourself; if I was encouraged by what the Friths have to say about bias, fear, kindness and collaboration (our brains learn to believe stereotypes and adjust our behaviour to match them, which explains a lot, I think), I was reassured that even they, to a degree, find each other unknowable (minds are mysterious and perhaps that is a good thing, sometimes). The plasticity of the brain, and its ability to function even when parts of it are damaged, will never cease to be amazing. But I must be honest: it wasn’t the science that I relished most, so much as the storytelling talents of Alex Frith and Daniel Locke. Their strips are an all-out treat, packed with visual similes and metaphors, slapstick jokes and witty, meta footnotes. With their round heads, which may be flipped open like boiled eggs to reveal the enigmatic organ within, and their ever smiling faces, the Friths, as they are drawn here, are at once themselves, clever and authoritative, and two highly original comic book characters, always larking about, always indulging in provocative little marital arguments. Like this book, they are truly delightful; you feel glad that they, and it, exist.  Two Heads by Uta Frith, Chris Frith, Alex Frith and Daniel Locke is published by Bloomsbury (£18.99).

3/29/2022,"This psychological drama from German director Bastian Günther is based on a real-life event. A 1997 documentary by SR Bindler called Hands on a Hardbody was about the annual sleep-deprivation endurance contest run by an East Texas auto dealership, where 24 people compete to win a brand-new Nissan Hardbody pickup truck by keeping at least one hand on it for the longest continuous time. They are allowed brief hourly breaks but cannot sleep, or lean their weight against the vehicle, and if they take their hands off it for any reason, they’re out. US festival audiences found something sympathetic and humorous about these stoic hopefuls and there was even a stage musical version with a happy ending. Robert Altman was apparently developing a feature version just before he died, though reportedly envisioning something darker, like They Shoot Horses, Don’t They? Günther’s film is certainly no Broadway musical though he has created an ingenious, if far-fetched narrative twist, a contrivance whose complications he can’t quite absorb into the script. But this is audaciously structured with a sombre coda sequence placed after the end of the contest. Günther invents two key characters: Carrie Preston plays Joan, who runs the dealership PR and is a lonely divorcee on the online dating circuit. British actor Joe Cole plays Kyle, a competitor who is an unemployed local guy with a wife and baby daughter; he is desperate for cash and taking this contest far too seriously. Günther lets us savour the strangeness of this spectacle: a circle of people who look as if they are worshipping a sacred object, a laying-on-of-hands ritual in the church of capitalism or a secular seance to call up the spirit of the American dream. They also look like a group of people under arrest, keeping their hands on the car where the cops can see them. As people faint or stagger away, Kyle faces-off with an obnoxious guy playing nasty mind-games that are even creepier than we suspect; after four or five days without sleep, Kyle fears (with good reason) that he is losing his sanity and enters a dangerous new mental state. This is a watchable film, but one that somehow doesn’t allow you much access to the competitors’ minds. As they become more and more catatonic, the film does too. Günther gives Kyle dreams or hallucinatory reveries, but nothing so lenient as an illustrative flashback, except for the one that closes the film after it is all too late. We know from the film’s antecedents that bleakness is not the only way of telling this tale, nor is it necessarily the most truthful one. Yet Günther gives us his own version with conviction.

3/29/2022,"The Met Office is increasing the temperature threshold for heatwaves across eight English counties as the climate heats up. Heatwaves are defined as happening when a location records at least three days in a row with daily maximum temperatures meeting or exceeding a certain threshold. Heatwave definitions are designed to be relative to the current climate, and with average temperatures rising in the UK as a result of global heating, thresholds are being increased for parts of England. The weather and climate body said the three-day temperature threshold for a heatwave would increase from 27C to 28C for six counties: Surrey, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire, Cambridgeshire. In Lincolnshire, temperatures will have to reach 27C for three days for it to be classed as a heatwave, an increase from 26C, and the East Riding of Yorkshire will have a 26C threshold, up from 25C. Dr Mark McCarthy, the head of the Met Office National Climate Information Centre, which manages the UK’s climate records, said: “Climate statistics over time reveal an undeniable warming trend for the UK. Temperature rise has been greatest across parts of central and eastern England where they have increased by more than 1.0C in some locations, while further north areas of Scotland and Northern Ireland have seen temperatures rise by closer to 0.7C.” He added: “Although heatwaves are extreme weather events, research shows that climate change is making these events more likely. A scientific study by the Met Office into the summer 2018 heatwave in the UK showed that it was 30 times more likely to occur now than in 1750 because of the higher concentration of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, in the atmosphere. “As greenhouse gas concentrations increase, heatwaves of similar intensity are projected to become even more frequent, perhaps occurring as regularly as every other year.” Previous heatwave thresholds were based on the climate in the period 1981-2010 and were intended to be reviewed and revised to represent heatwaves relative to the current climate, the Met Office said. The new thresholds are based on the climate from 1991-2020, which was brought in as the reference period in January this year, and are being updated ahead of summer. The heatwave thresholds are separate from extreme heat warnings, which highlight very high temperatures to help protect lives and property, and from the UK Health Security Agency heat-health alert, issued in England only, to flag up the impact of prolonged heat on public health.",News/UK news,Met Office to increase heatwave thresholds across parts of England,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/29/met-office-increase-heatwave-threshold-across-parts-england
