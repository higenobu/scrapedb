Zahawi’s hint came amid reports Sunak will look again at a further council tax rebate in the autumn, after the chancellor was widely criticised for a statement that appeared to do little to ease the pressures of rising energy prices and inflation. Sunak announced a rise in the threshold for paying national insurance, as well as a 5p fuel duty cut, but no additional rise in benefits. The Resolution Foundation has predicted half a million children could be pushed below the poverty line next year. Zahawi told Sky’s Sophy Ridge that there would likely be further help, amid reported tensions between Sunak and Boris Johnson over the reception for the statement. “I think he will continue to keep an eye on this, it’s only right,” he said. “It’s irresponsible for me to say ‘job done’ because energy prices are volatile, inflation remains high, so it would be absolutely irresponsible to say ‘job done’. “But I think £22bn, in one year, of help when you’ve just spent £400bn is the right thing to do.” The Sunday Times reported that the chancellor was considering proposals for a new council tax rebate in the autumn, with consumers facing the possibility of further fuel bill rises in October. On Friday, the energy price cap will rise by almost £700 to £1,971 – but could rise to just under £3,000 by October 2022 for the average dual fuel bill. The shadow work and pensions secretary said Sunak had been “playing games” by announcing a future 1p cut to income tax in the statement while people were struggling this year. “Rishi Sunak absolutely had more room for manoeuvre in this spring statement and mini budget, but rather than acting in the interests of the British people, he was playing games,” said Jon Ashworth. “He was acting in his own interest because he thinks by offering an income tax cut in two years that’ll help him politically with Conservative MPs if there’s a leadership contest or that’ll fit the Tory election grid.” Labour has called for the chancellor to cut VAT on energy bills and to impose a windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas companies, as well as cancelling the planned rise in national insurance from April. “He’s imposed these very punishing tax rises, these very severe real-terms cuts to the pension and support like universal credit, and he’s expecting people to be grateful because two years down the road he’s saying there’s going to be an income tax cut even though that income tax cut nowhere near offsets the 15 tax rises that he has imposed on the British people, 3,000 extra per household if you do a rough and ready calculation,” he told Sky. “He is a tax-rising chancellor, he is Mr Tax and it’s the British people who are paying the price.”",News/Business,"Sunak planning further help with cost of living, Zahawi suggests ",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/27/sunak-planning-further-help-cost-of-living-zahawi
3/27/2022,"Imagine that was a league game. England found a path to victory. They were better after half-time. They had the strength of character to come from behind. It’s a sign of a title-winning team that they can still win when nowhere near their best. A lot of the squad players had a run-out. The friendly win against Switzerland, in that sense, was a satisfactory evening for Gareth Southgate. But this was not a league game. It was international football, so everything is heightened, hysterical and overblown, albeit not perhaps as much as it would have been in the pre-Southgate days. There is so little evidence available that everything has to be over-scrutinised – except, perhaps, the opposition. This is a very good Switzerland side. They’ve just progressed unbeaten through qualifying, eliminating Italy on the way. That was Murat Yakin’s first defeat in eight games as coach. They are, for what it’s worth, ranked 14th in the world, just nine places below England. Nobody had scored twice against them since the world champions France in the Euros last summer – and Switzerland ended up winning that tie on penalties. Switzerland are, by pretty much any measure, the best side England have faced since the Euros. But the tendency seems to be to think that because it’s 41 years since England lost to Switzerland then of course we should be beating this lot. But a win against Switzerland, in the present context, is a decent result. Viewing this with an eye on the World Cup, Switzerland are likely to be the level of the next best team in the group. But there must also be a sense of realism, if a friendly is to have any purpose. It was not a decent performance. The best that could be said of the defending in the first half was that at least Harry Maguire wasn’t there to take the blame. It was so shambolic that Jordan Pickford – usual demeanour: kid who’s had a fizzy 1980s orangeade before 6am on Christmas morning – was telling people to calm down. That perhaps is an indication of why Maguire is necessary, and even more so, why England will probably play with two holding midfielders in the games that matter. In that sense Saturday’s game felt like yet another example of familiar Southgate issues. There is the demand to attack, not to squander this unprecedented generation of creative talent, to unleash Jack Grealish. On the other hand, there is the reality of international football in which, necessarily given time constraints on coaches, attacking patterns are less sophisticated than in the club game. Italy and Portugal won the previous two Euros through the strength of their defence. France won the 2018 World Cup playing cautiously, relying on their attacking power when things went wrong. Germany won the 2014 World Cup by counter-attacking. Even Spain, when passing teams into oblivion, were accused of being boring in the way they stifled matches through possession. In June 1963, England beat Switzerland 8-1 in Basel. Later that year, they beat Northern Ireland 8-3. Perhaps, people began to think, Alf Ramsey might deliver on his promise that England would win the World Cup. But the following year, at a mini-tournament in Brazil, England lost 1-0 to Argentina in a game in which they had dominated possession. For Ramsey, this was confirmation of what he had already suspected: the highest level of international football is about control. It doesn’t matter whether you beat a lesser team 8-0 or 1-0; what matters is not losing against the best. And England, particularly before half-time, lacked control. The Southgate template at the Euros was clear: a back four in games in which he expects to dominate possession; a back three in games in which that is less certain. Saturday felt like a slight tweak on that: a back three protected by just one holder in Jordan Henderson, flanked by Connor Gallagher and Mason Mount – an attempt perhaps to retain control but with a little more flair. But it didn’t work because Switzerland kept winning the ball back in the England half and were repeatedly able to get balls into the box. When the wing-backs pushed up, there was a clear vulnerability behind them; when they didn’t, England were overmanned in the middle. Fielding two of Henderson, Declan Rice and Kalvin Phillips (or possibly Jude Bellingham, although that remains largely untested) would seem an obvious solution. And then there was the well-worn trope of Harry Kane dropping deep. He is very good at it and it should be a key part of England’s armoury, but it’s largely pointless unless somebody runs beyond him. That is Raheem Sterling’s game, but it is not Phil Foden’s. In Foden and Mount, England have two tactically-intelligent advanced midfielder-forwards. The thought of them playing together, creating angles, generating space, is mouth-watering, but it didn’t work against Hungary last year and it didn’t work on Saturday. In this structure, perhaps it is simply one or the other, with Kane and a runner. For all the talk of sophistication, the England goals came in the most traditional ways imaginable: squeezing up to regain possession after a high ball in behind the full-back, then a penalty following a corner. Jack Charlton could have scripted them. And there is a lesson also in that. If you have control, there are plenty of ways to score. But if you don’t have control there are plenty of ways to concede. And that’s why control, in international football, is paramount.",Sport/Football,Switzerland remind Southgate that international football is about control | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/27/switzerland-remind-southgate-that-international-football-is-about-control
3/27/2022,"A mother whose 20-year-old daughter was kicked to death because she was dressed as a goth has said she feels “ignored” and “silenced” by the justice system as her killer is set to be freed from prison. Sophie Lancaster was murdered and her boyfriend badly beaten in what a judge described as a “feral” and “savage” attack by teenagers in Lancashire in August 2007. Her killer, Ryan Herbert, was 16 when he was jailed for life in 2008 and ordered to serve a minimum of 16 years in prison. His sentence was later reduced to 14 and a half years on appeal. The Parole Board last week said Herbert, 30, can be released from prison after making “significant changes to his life”. Sophie’s mother, Sylvia Lancaster, said she had not been given an explanation for the decision and she felt that the views of bereaved families were often ignored. She said: “Fourteen years ago he was given a 16-year sentence. What are they saying? Are they saying that the crime is not as important as it was then? I find that quite a difficult concept to deal with.” Lancaster, who was awarded an OBE in 2014 for her campaigning on hate crime, worked with young offenders before her daughter’s murder and believes strongly in the ability of people to change for the better. She is also an advocate for the rehabilitation of prisoners. However, she said cannot square this belief with the level of violence suffered by her daughter in 2007. Sophie’s injuries were so severe that paramedics could not facially distinguish if she was male or female. Trainer marks were visible on her face from where Herbert and others had stamped on her head until she fell into a coma. She died 13 days after the attack. Speaking from her home in Lancashire, where framed pictures of Sophie decorate the living room and hallway, Lancaster said she did not believe Herbert’s rehabilitation “alters the facts” of her daughter’s murder. She said: “People will say he’s done his time. That’s all right for him and his family. What about me and mine? When do we finish doing our time? Not only does it take your daughter’s life and her future, in reality they take your future as well. “It doesn’t matter how liberal and left[wing] you are. At the end of the day, they’ve taken a life. That’s just as important 16 years ago as it is now. It doesn’t alter the facts.” A Parole Board hearing was told that Herbert had made “exceptional progress in his rehabilitation” and ruled that he had made “significant changes to his life which reflected his remorse, his insight and increased maturity”. He was moved to an open prison in November 2020 where he “improved his education with studies to degree level”, according to a summary of the panel’s decision. Lancaster said she was given the opportunity to submit a victim impact statement to the Parole Board hearing but chose not to as she felt it would be dismissed. Parole Board decisions are based solely on whether a prisoner would represent a significant risk to the public after release. Victims and their families are invited to explain the impact of the offence. However, it has no bearing on the board’s decision about whether a prisoner should be freed. Lancaster said she felt “fed up” after evidence to previous parole hearings was “ignored”. “They just ignored what we said. You get to the stage where you just think, well, there’s no point really. They’re not going to take any notice.” The Parole Board said it “very carefully” considered the views of victims and that it was “mindful of the life-changing impact of Mr Herbert’s offending on the victims and their families”. Lancaster said she felt let down by the justice system. “It’s as though your voice doesn’t matter. You’re silenced,” she said. “As a family, you’ve got justice – or as much justice as you’re ever going to get, and you know that. And then to start chipping away at it is really quite insulting. Once again, it seems that everything is focused on the perpetrator. Where is the victim’s voice in all of this?” Lancaster, a member of the government’s hate crime advisory group, campaigned successfully for police to record and monitor hate crimes against people from alternative subcultures. She is often asked whether she forgives her daughter’s killer. It is a question she has weighed for 15 years, and the answer is no. “I wonder sometimes if I did forgive him would that make it easier? Well, no I don’t really,” she said. “You’ve to be down and dirty to do what they did. I can’t forgive.”",News/UK news,Mother of woman killed for dressing as a goth says she feels ‘ignored’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/27/sophie-lancaster-mother-of-woman-killed-for-dressing-as-a-goth-says-she-feels-ignored
3/27/2022,"One of the oldest and largest wildlife NGOs in Belarus is being forced to shut down after accusations of “extremist activities”, as conservationists warn of “darkness” engulfing a region known for its rich natural heritage. Former employees of BirdLife Belarus (APB) were arrested and one has been in jail for six months under suspicion of attempting to destabilise the political situation in the country under the guise of protecting birds. The organisation has been ordered by a court to close next month after 24 years of work. Across the border in Ukraine, wildlife scientists working on bat conservation and the gut microbiome of venomous snakes are being accused of working on bioweapons. Vladimir Putin has erroneously claimed “dozens of laboratories in Ukraine” are experimenting with infectious diseases such as coronavirus under guidance from the US. In Belarus, environmentalists say they are concerned about phones being tapped and the safety of individuals who speak out. A source told the Guardian: “Belarus has pretty much been taken over by Putin. “The darkness that has engulfed the east of our region is catching up also with those protecting the environment,” the source said. “Aside from the sheer injustice, this a massive blow to conservation at a global scale.” These countries are home to Polesia, a wetlands area more than two-thirds the size of the UK (18m hectares), known as “the Amazon of Europe” for its extraordinary biodiversity, as well as parts of the Carpathian mountains and Danube delta, the largest river delta wetland in Europe. Adham Ashton-Butt from the British Trust for Ornithology has been working in the Belarus and Ukrainian parts of Polesia. In 2019, he said the region felt politically stable, but when he returned after the worst of the pandemic in 2021, dozens of NGOs had been closed down, with a spate of raids and arrests. APB was one of the last remaining organisations still operating. “Increasing paranoia from the government changed that,” he said. “Any organisation that was thought to have the potential to be anti-government was under threat. In terms of APB, I think this was completely false. APB were not involved in this kind of politics, they were completely focused on nature conservation.” Ashton-Butt said the organisation had achieved “huge things” with minimal funds. This included rewetting more than 17,200 hectares (42,000 acres) of carbon-rich peatlands and expanding one of Europe’s largest mire complexes, bringing it to a total size of 100,000 hectares. APB also led efforts to stop the E40 waterway development linking the Baltic and Black Seas, as well as saving the aquatic warbler from extinction. “If conservation organisations cannot work, it leads to the potential erosion of protected areas,” said Ashton-Butt, adding that it was “crazy” to think about Russian tanks driving over the pristine peatlands where he used to work. Some conservationists in Polesia have found themselves at the heart of the war, stuck in their houses without power or water. APB acted as a barrier against new development and with the organisation now gone there is more of a chance of large infrastructure projects going through, he said. “You can see drainage of wetlands and commercial forestry going ahead because no one is there to argue against it. The forests and peatlands of Belarus are the most pristine in Europe. If they are drained or degraded or cut down they will be the last forests and wetlands of their kind in Europe.” As Russia’s war on Ukraine continues and the fastest-growing refugee crisis since the second world war unfolds, human lives take priority. Environmental work is being put on hold and urgent attention is being directed to providing food and shelter for refugees leaving Ukraine. Neighbouring Romania, Slovakia and Poland are working to buy emergency supplies and deliver them to the border, as well as helping colleagues fleeing the country. The Frankfurt Zoological Society has lost more than a third of its European programme due to the war in Ukraine, where it had been doing conservation work for two decades. It has supported efforts to help refugees fleeing the conflict find a temporary place to stay in protected areas. Organisations such as WWF and the International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN have released statements saying that peace is essential for nature to thrive, condemning the war as having profound humanitarian and ecological consequences. “The damage caused by armed conflicts goes far beyond that caused by the fighting itself. By destroying governance, the reverberating ecological consequences of conflicts can last decades,” the UN said in a statement. Politically the war risks compromising the biodiversity plan of the European Green Deal, with the EU delaying publication of the sustainable use of pesticides directive and targets for “nature restoration”, citing concerns about food security arising from the war. More than 160 environment NGOs have signed a letter to the European Commission asking it not to postpone green proposals, because of the urgent need to tackle the climate and biodiversity crises. Instead of cutting provisions for nature in response to the war, they argue the commission should be cutting food waste, reducing livestock numbers, reliance on fertiliser and discouraging the use of food crops for energy. Ariel Brunner, head of policy for BirdLife Europe and Central Asia, said: “There is a furious attempt going on to derail them [the green proposals] in the name of food security. Basically, the farm lobbies are saying, ‘there is a war in Ukraine, Ukraine will not export grain, this will lead to a food security crisis’, and that we need to get back to produce, produce, produce, and drop the environmental stuff.” Brunner believes this risks killing the green agenda and fuelling the next environment crisis. “There is a scientific consensus that the one big threat to our ability to feed ourselves is climate change and the collapse of ecosystems, so using food security to not deal with these problems is completely self-defeating.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/Environment, Ukraine war deals ‘massive blow’ to nature as Belarus’s largest wildlife NGO shut down,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/27/ukraine-war-deals-massive-blow-to-nature-as-belarus-largest-wildlife-ngo-shut-down-aoe

3/27/2022,"Student strikes have forced a string of school closures across Chile’s capital amid growing anger over sexist and violent behaviour only weeks after the country returned to in-person classes after two years of Covid-19 lockdowns. “The demand is to stop the harassment,” said Javiera, 17, who was one of hundreds of girls to join protests outside the prestigious Santiago Lastarria school, after male students were found swapping intimate photos of their female classmates on Instagram. “We are demanding justice for victims, and for schools to stop protecting abusers.” In the chats, the boys allegedly discussed gang-raping their fellow students and claimed the notorious “wolfpack” case in Pamplona, Spain, as “inspiration”. Screenshots of the conversations circulated among female students in several Santiago schools, who organized the protest in solidarity with the affected students. The Lastarria school was closed for two days and the culprits have been suspended while an investigation takes place. The district’s mayor, Evelyn Matthei, launched a support helpline for schoolchildren affected by gender violence and has pledged legal action. “These threats are a crime that warrants action beyond school protocols,” she said in a press conference. Javiera believes a firm response from authorities is necessary. “Maybe [the schoolboys] haven’t caused physical harm to anyone, but such talk can often lead to something worse.” Physical attacks have also taken place in Santiago’s schools this month. Last week, a 14-year-old was reportedly raped in a classroom by an older student during a lunch break. Students and parents staged protests outside the school’s locked gates, pelting the building with rocks while demanding explanations. “I put my trust in this school and they return me a daughter who has been raped,” the girl’s father bitterly told a local news station. A statement from the school’s management confirmed the institution’s temporary closure to allow time to investigate “the very serious situation at hand”. According to the government’s education department, schoolchildren’s sexual harassment complaints have increased by 56% in 2022 compared with the same period in 2018. A Unesco report concluded that Covid school closures across the world have had gendered impacts on children, “which may also increase their vulnerability to ... gender-based violence”. Valentina Carrasco is a 21-year-old student activist who has been fighting for sexual education reforms since she was at secondary school. She believes that the pandemic has exacerbated cases of gender violence in Chile: “Young people were at home for two years without seeing people, now they’re in classes again and everything has exploded.” She believes the only way to remedy the country’s schooling crisis is to improve education. “Now more than ever we need inclusive sexual education programs that talk about consent and sexuality within a socio-cultural perspective.”",News/Global development,Chile: students force closure of Santiago schools over sexual harassment and violence,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/27/chile-students-close-schools-protest-sexual-harassment-violence

Pwdin is in love with Petula and determined to find her. His quest takes him into space. Here, he meets astronaut Neil Armstrong, a variation of Saint-Exupéry’s Little Prince, and Petula’s parents (pop stars called Beyoncé Clark and Ed Sheeran). Travelling on the back of a “flea of knowledge” called Gillian Anderson, he takes a tour of planets Petula might have visited, including one that is home to the dead and another where children wait to be born (meanwhile, on Earth, Pwdin’s vampire-actress stepmother and father are busy making him a brother). Translator/adapter Daf James recognises, in a programme note, that some people might call Fabrice Melquiot’s 2007 play “absurd”. For James, though, “it’s incredibly realistic in the way it deals with trauma and the confusion of growing up”. Whether absurd or realistic, there’s certainly a tremendous playfulness in the way that Melquiot smudges boundaries, actual and imaginary (enhanced by Jean Chan’s all-black design of a series of ball pits, spattered with Will Monks’s drop-down videos). Characters move between auditorium and stage, address the audience directly, comment on the action; Pwdin’s Earthbound family follow his progress, squinting through a giant telescope; space itself takes on physical form and delivers its opinions.

Under Mathilde López’s direction, the patterned chaos of Melquiot’s text sometimes lacks momentum; scenes need trimming and crisping up.

3/27/2022,"Whatever Sheryl Crow says, we’re not convinced change will do us good. When something we rely on disappears, it prompts emotions ranging from anger to panic. But when change is forced on us, our societies and economies are actually surprisingly resilient. In the pandemic, firms that had never heard of Zoom were operating entirely remotely in days. A tube strike in 2014 (ie back when workers went nuts if they weren’t able to commute, rather than because they’d been asked to again) closed stations, forcing people to try alternative travel plans. When stations reopened, what happened? Those who’d been disrupted were more likely to switch to new, better commuting patterns. By forcing experimentation, the strike made us more efficient. Today, the challenge is imagining living without Russian gas. Overnight bans on imports would have big economic effects, but economists have turned to history to show that disaster is by no means inevitable. In 2010, China banned exports to Japan of key industrial inputs: rare earth materials. China was the sole supplier, so you might have thought this would cripple the Japanese economy. But it didn’t, because rising costs pushed firms to adapt production radically: using rare earths more efficiently (glassmakers recycled polish that relied on a rare earth mineral) or finding alternatives. War always triggers big supply-and-demand shocks, but also shows how radically we can adapt. During the Second World War, US military planners were told their goal of producing 50,000 aircraft was impossible, before changes to assembly lines and workforce management saw almost 100,000 planes built in 1944 alone. Germany, meanwhile, suffering from petrol shortages, converted half-a-million vehicles to run by burning wood. Humans, and capitalism, are more flexible than we think.

3/27/2022,"As much of North America was locked down during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, Matty Clarke was in boat full of supplies, motoring up the Yukon River. He was searching for wild lands where he could strike it rich. “Getting myself a goldmine,” he told viewers on his YouTube channel. “Everyone’s heard about all this gold up there. You must be curious yourself – what’s actually going on up there? Can I just show up with all this stuff and end up having a goldmine? I think so.” For the last two years, Clarke has battled the bitter cold and relentless mosquitoes of the boreal forests as he set up a new home in Canada’s northern hinterlands, chronicling his survival in regular YouTube updates. But he now finds himself squaring off against a new foe: a frustrated government trying to evict him from his homestead on Ensley Creek, south of the town of Dawson City. The Yukon’s most famous poet once described the region as “unpeopled and still”, but despite its vast scale, the territory’s government says people can’t just show up to a clearing in the forest and build homes without permits. Since last year, officials have been trying to get Clarke and another self-styled pioneer, Simon Tourigny, to leave. The territory says they are illegally occupying public land and have defied orders to vacate. They are now petitioning a court to intervene. Originally from Newfoundland, Clarke operates a popular YouTube channel called “Skote outdoors”, which documented his 2020 journey up the Yukon River to stake a mining claim and a real-life tutorial on building a log cabin. In the videos, he is seen felling trees and chopping notches into the logs. “This is the real dream for me here now,” he says in one video as he speeds along a snowy landscape on a snowmobile. “It’s a good life out here. Everyone told me it was going to be a real struggle. And it was … But the hard times are vastly outweighed by the good times.” His videos often receive nearly 10,000 views – and the government has used them and his social media post as their evidence against him. The territory alleges that Clarke had errors in his mining claim and permit – and says that officials saw no evidence of mining by the YouTuber. “Even if Mr Clarke had honestly and properly staked the Claim, doing so did not give Mr Clarke authority under the [Placer Mining Act] or any other Yukon legislation to construct a cabin at the Site for his permanent residence,” said the government’s court petition. In an email to a territorial land manager, Clarke says the fight is about more than one log cabin. “I do not look at myself as a trespasser but a guardian or steward of the land,” he wrote. Clarke did not respond to a request for comment. While his videos stress Clarke’s isolation – the second season of his show is called Alone in the Yukon – his cabin is less than a kilometre from Simon Tourigny’s, as well as those of two other squatters. Tourigny, who sees himself as someone learning the “old skills” of backcountry living, arrived in the region in 2016 and admits he has no valid permits to occupy the land. But like Clarke, he has no intention of leaving. Rather than fussing over bylaws and building codes, Tourigny has employed a more abstract defence, arguing in an editorial last year that his values were under attack. “Which part of what we are doing is ‘unauthorized’? Our cabins or our lifestyles? They won’t say, either because they don’t know or because the truth cannot be admitted,” Tourigny wrote in the Yukon News. “Are we not allowed to exist in the forest?” Tourigny, who the Guardian was unable to reach, says he and others “simply took responsibility for our own lives” and are “literally living the dream of millions”. The letter kicked off fierce debate in the Yukon, with a subsequent letter from a resident calling Tourigny’s claims “whining, snivelling, self-righteous”. Both Tourigny and Clarke have built their cabins on the land of the Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in First Nation. While Tourigny has claimed “Every Indigenous person I’ve ever met seems to genuinely appreciate what I’m doing” the band has not made any public comment on their presence on the land. Neither case has been heard in court yet, but the territorial government is requesting both Tourigny and Clarke be required to leave the land – and not be able to settle anywhere else in the territory without prior authority. In his editorial, Tourigny suggests he is unwilling to back down. “We are waiting to be arrested and forcibly taken to court to be put before a judge, the last person in a long line of people refusing to listen to us where fines or imprisonment await.”",News/World news,Pioneer or squatter?
