2/28/2022,"Sometimes bosses need to take care of their own business. Taking to his Instagram Stories over the weekend, Rick Ross gave fans an inside look at his lumberjack aspirations, after he decided he needed to chop down 10 massive oak trees on his property for the sake of his farm animals. The task seemed straight forward enough for Rozzay, but he when he got a quote of $10,000‚Äî$1,000 for each tree‚Äîfrom an outside contractor, he knew he needed to take matters into his own hands. ‚ÄúI just told my homie, ‚ÄòYou go to Home Depot and you go get me the biggest motherfuckin‚Äô saw there is with a big chain, and you crank that motherfucker. Imma cut the trees down.‚Äô You heard me? The thing about business, I‚Äôm hands on so Imma handle my own‚Ä¶ Hold on, I need someone to hit Kanye and tell Kanye I need some of them boots, I‚Äôm going to cut the tree down. I need some boots. Yeezy! I need them boots, baby!‚Äù Shortly after his declaration, Ross could be seen rocking a large cowboy-esque hat as he stood in his mansion, telling his followers that he‚Äôs ‚Äúhands on‚Äù and will ‚Äúcut down my own motherfuckin‚Äô trees.‚Äù As Ross explained, it was officially time for him to make room for his animals. The Instagram story that immediately followed showed Ross with a saw in hand while he cut down his own oak trees, as promised. He was, of course, successful in his property upkeep, later riding around on an ATV and doing celebratory donuts. ‚ÄúInstead of me paying $10,000 to an outsider, went to Home Depot and bought two new saws for $2,000,‚Äù Ross said. ‚ÄúWas really only $5,000 worth of work. You take the $5,000, give that to your homies‚Ä¶ You still got $3,000 for ya pockets. Come on, man, you could go get Wing Stop, man.‚Äù Check out the entire tree-chopping saga above.

2/28/2022,"(Adds details from official) By Idrees Ali and Phil Stewart WASHINGTON, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Russia, frustrated by early battlefield setbacks in Ukraine, could be shifting its strategy to siege warfare just as President Vladimir Putin raises the risk of a catastrophic miscalculation by putting nuclear forces on heightened alert, a senior U.S. defense official said on Sunday. Putin gave the order to his nuclear forces as Washington assesses that Russian troops have made limited progress in their four-day-old invasion due to stiff Ukrainian resistance and planning failures that have left some units without fuel or other supplies, U.S. officials said. As missiles rained down on Ukrainian cities, hundreds of thousands of civilians, mainly women and children, were fleeing the Russian assault into neighboring countries. The United States assesses that Russia has fired more than 350 missiles at Ukrainian targets so far, some hitting civilian infrastructure, the senior U.S. defense official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Still, it had so far mainly focused on military targets. Citing a Russian offensive on the Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, north of Kyiv, the official cited early indications that Russia might be adopting siege tactics. ""It appears that they are adopting a siege mentality, which any student of military tactics and strategy will tell you, when you adopt siege tactics, it increases the likelihood of collateral damage,"" the official said. So far, the Russian offensive cannot claim any major victories. Russian has not taken any Ukrainian city, does not control Ukraine's airspace, and its troops remained roughly 30 km (19 miles) from Kyiv's city center for a second day, the official said. Images on social media showed some Russian military vehicles in Ukraine, including battle tanks, that had apparently been abandoned after running out of fuel, raising questions about logistical failures. ""They simply don't have a lot of experience moving on another nation state at this level of complexity and size,"" the official said. The official said it was unclear whether it was a failure in planning or execution, but added that Russian forces were likely to adapt and overcome the challenges. Russia has still not moved into Ukraine about a third of the troops that Putin had arrayed around its borders, the official said. But it has rapidly increased the number of forces Moscow has sent into Ukraine in recent days. NUCLEAR RISK The Pentagon learned of the heightened Russian alert for its nuclear forces from Putin's televised announcement, the senior U.S. defense official said, instead of from American intelligence sources. Just after Putin spoke, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the top U.S. commander for Europe, General Tod Wolters, held a pre-scheduled meeting at 8:30 a.m. (1330 GMT) at which they discussed the Russian president's decision. Although Washington was still gathering information, Putin's move was troubling, the official said. ""It's clearly, essentially, putting in play forces that, if there's a miscalculation, could make things much, much more dangerous,"" the official said. Asked whether the United States would continue to provide military assistance to Ukraine following Putin's announcement, the official said: ""That support is going to go forward."" Mick Mulroy, a former senior Pentagon official and retired CIA paramilitary officer, said he believed Putin's decision to elevate the alert of his nuclear forces was a reaction to battlefield losses. ""Russia placing its nuclear forces on alert is incredibly reckless and a clear indication that Putin realizes his military is not performing as expected in Ukraine,"" Murloy said.
