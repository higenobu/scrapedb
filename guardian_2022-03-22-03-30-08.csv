3/22/2022,"Hitting children is wrong. The Labour first minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, called Monday a “historic day” for Welsh children. He is deservedly proud of his government’s achievement in introducing a ban on smacking, which follows a similar decision in Scotland. The spotlight should now turn to England and Northern Ireland, where the “reasonable chastisement” defence to the charge of assaulting a child remains in place. That it exists at all is due to long legal precedent, including a notorious case in 1860 when a teenage boy was flogged to death at school in London. His teacher was convicted of manslaughter but the judge decreed that “reasonable” beatings should be allowed. Ever since, efforts to change the law have foundered on objections to the state’s interference in family life, and the lingering notion that parents should have the right to administer corporal punishments, even after they were banned in schools in 1987. A growing international consensus, guided by the UN convention on the rights of the child, makes it clear that they should not. Article 19 states that governments must protect children from all forms of violence. Sweden was the first state to do so in 1979. Many others have done so since. Doctors say violence makes children more aggressive and raises the risk of mental health issues. But in the UK, the Children Act of 2004 reaffirmed a parent’s right to smack or allow others to smack on their behalf. Scottish politicians overthrew this in 2019, followed by the Welsh. In Wales it was decided to take longer over introducing the new law, in order that a £2m public information campaign could happen first. Research suggests that this approach was sensible, with public opinion divided over whether the ban is a good idea. While a survey last year found that 47% believe smacking children isn’t necessary, 34% think it sometimes is. As with any new law, much will depend on enforcement. Police and social workers must be alert to the possibility of malicious reports, for example where family members are in dispute. Parents who were smacked themselves are more likely to smack their children. So care must be taken not to stigmatise families whose parenting style may be viewed by some as rough or unenlightened. The claim by the Welsh Conservatives that the law amounts to “new-age dogma” is ridiculous. Non-violent family life is a rational, humane objective; children should not be inducted by adults into a way of relating to others that involves physical threats, slaps or punches. But the state must support people as they adjust to a law which aims to change their behaviour. Research has shown that, mostly, when parents strike children it is because they have lost control. Wales’s new law, and similar laws elsewhere, will not stop people from losing their tempers. What it does is to give children the same protection, in the event that they are assaulted, as other people. This should not be regarded as a utopian scheme. To grant adults a licence to physically hurt children is to take a risk with their safety and wellbeing. The NSPCC supports the withdrawal of the “reasonable punishment” defence in England and Northern Ireland, as does Sir Keir Starmer. The Northern Ireland children’s commissioner, Koulla Yiasouma, believes that Stormont should change the law. Her English counterpart, Dame Rachel de Souza, should join the campaign. The UK doesn’t need this archaic cop-out clause any more.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on smacking bans: Wales has done the right thing | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/21/the-guardian-view-on-smacking-bans-wales-has-done-the-right-thing
3/22/2022,"My colleague and friend Peter Padfield, who has died aged 89, was a freelance author who made an outstanding contribution to the history of the sea, as a seaman, historian and analyst, across five decades. Born in Kolkata, India, Peter came from an army family. His father, William Padfield, was a captain in the Royal Engineers attached to the Indian army, and his mother, Annice (nee Abbott), was the daughter of the colonel of engineers in Bombay (now Mumbai). William died when Peter was seven, and Peter returned to England with his mother and younger brother, attending Northcliffe House prep school in Sussex, which was evacuated to Cornwall during the second world war. Later, he was educated at Christ’s hospital in West Sussex, and the Thames Nautical Training College, HMS Worcester. Peter then served as a navigating officer in P&O liners, before joining the crew of the replica 17th-century Mayflower, recreating the pilgrim fathers’ voyage, described in his first and last books, The Sea Is a Magic Carpet (1959) and Mayflower II Diary (2019). Peter met Jane Yarwood, whom he married in 1960, in London, where he worked in nautical journalism until the international success of The Titanic and the Californian (1965) encouraged him to become a full-time writer. The number of books Peter wrote, and the range of subject matter, demonstrates a wide and inclusive engagement with Britain, the sea and, in the case of his Nazi studies, the need to understand what lay on the other side of the hill in the second world war. His work was distinguished by a zest for challenging comfortable orthodoxies, whether it be about the Titanic disaster, or the politics and personality of the last leader of Nazi Germany, Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz. Peter highlighted Dönitz’s early and profound attachment to Nazi ideology, at a time when many were reimagining the war criminal as a hero. The Maritime Trilogy, Peter’s three-volume study of British maritime identity, inspired other scholars, myself included, to reconsider the connections between the state, maritime enterprise and sea power, making a critical contribution to 21st-century debates about Britishness, attracting high-profile commentary and awards. My favourite among his books is Broke and the Shannon of 1968, an elegant study of a great seaman and his defining battle, a work that continues to shape our understanding of the long-forgotten Anglo-American war of 1812. Peter was a scholar-seaman of the highest standing, an author who followed his own path and made a massive contribution to that most British of subjects, maritime history. Jane died in 2018 and Peter’s brother, Tim, died in 2020. Peter is survived by his children, Deborah, Guy and Fiona, and grandchildren, Max and Megan.",Arts/Books,Peter Padfield obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/21/peter-padfield-obituary
3/22/2022,"The Rugby Football Union has been accused of dishonesty after claiming that England have made progress under Eddie Jones during the Six Nations. Jones, contracted until the end of the 2023 World Cup, has come under increasing pressure after England finished with just two victories in the Six Nations with several former players calling for him to be sacked. The RFU, however, issued a statement on Sunday insisting he has the union’s “full support”, going on to claim that it was “encouraged by the solid progress” made by England and that “strong positive steps forward” had been taken. England, however, also finished with two wins 12 months ago and in scoring eight tries across the entire tournament they managed four fewer than last year. As was the case then, the RFU will hold a debrief into England’s campaign and while there are performance-related break clauses in Jones’s contract, there seems no prospect of the union’s chief executive, Bill Sweeney, invoking them. Addressing the statement, attributed to an RFU spokesperson, the former England and British & Irish Lions wing and Guardian columnist Ugo Monye said on the BBC ‘s Rugby Union Daily podcast: “If you are going to make a statement on behalf of the RFU, I want to know who is saying it. “I think everyone wants to know who is saying it. Who, in the eyes of the RFU, thinks that signified progress and that they are happy with how things are at the moment?. My first thought was, in fact I had to read it again, I thought, ‘this is class banter’. Genuinely. Fundamentally, it’s just dishonest. There isn’t progress. Two out of five last year was an underperformance, hence why we had to have this deep-dive review, which questioned absolutely everything.” The former Wales and Lions captain Sam Warburton, speaking on the same podcast, said the RFU was attempting to deflect attention from Jones’s future but questioned why it pointed to an “encouraging” campaign given the obvious anger among supporters. “I think that Eddie has sat down with England and they’ve gone behind closed doors: ‘You’re going to be our guy until the World Cup, whatever happens, we’re not going to change our coach now. We’re going to do this so everyone gets off your back.’ I don’t think it’s true. It’s not honest, what they’ve said. Apart from Italy, none of the other five nations in the Six Nations would see two wins as progress. Don’t lie to us. “It’s to try and get the press off Eddie’s back, so there are no questions of ‘should Eddie go?’ Everyone knows Eddie’s staying. Just say: ‘We know there are going to be questions about Eddie’s future. Eddie is going to be our coach until the next World Cup.’ If they said that, I think people would accept it. But what they’ve said ... it’s blatantly not progress. If you’re Italy, it’s progress. If you’re England, it’s definitely not progress. It’s just a lie.” The RFU, which declined to comment on the criticism, has said the playing squad’s feedback will be taken into account as part of its debrief but, publicly at least, they have come out in support of Jones. The hooker Jamie George said: “I think he’s absolutely the right man for the job. He’s been absolutely brilliant to all of the players so far and we’ve all got every confidence we can turn this around. “The pressure shouldn’t solely lie on Eddie. The players have to take some responsibility on the back of a disappointing campaign. Eddie has got the full backing of the squad.”",Sport/Sport,RFU’s rosy view of England under Eddie Jones decried as ‘dishonest’ ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/21/rfu-england-eddie-jones-six-nations

London ambulance service paramedics had tried to treat her following the collision in Green Street, Newham. Officers were called out to reports of the crash at around 1.35pm on Monday and the Met has since launched an investigation. A spokesperson said: “The Met is investigating the incident and the van driver is with police, but he has not been arrested.” Road closures were in place around the scene throughout Monday afternoon. The Met is urging any witnesses to the crash or anyone else with information to contact them on 101.

3/22/2022,"The Indianapolis Colts have acquired former NFL MVP Matt Ryan from the Atlanta Falcons, according to multiple reports. The Colts, who were looking for a new starting quarterback after trading Carson Wentz to the Washington Commanders, sent a third-round pick to the Falcons in exchange for the 36-year-old. Trade!! The #Falcons are in agreement on a trade of QB Matt Ryan to the #Colts, per @MikeGarafolo, @TomPelissero and me. ATL gets a 3rd back.Fallout from the Deshaun Watson situation, with Ryan starting over in Indy. Ryan gets a contract adjustment with more guaranteed money. Speculation that Ryan would leave the Falcons had risen in recent days after the team actively pursued Deshaun Watson, who eventually joined the Cleveland Browns. The Falcons drafted Ryan with the No 3 overall pick in the 2008 draft and he has played his entire professional career in Atlanta. He was named league MVP for the 2016 season, when he led the Falcons to the Super Bowl where they infamously lost to the New England Patriots despite at one point holding a 28-3 lead. Ryan had reportedly wanted to remain in Atlanta, even though head coach Arthur Smith had refused to say whether the team intended to stick with their veteran quarterback. “There’s not many guys like Matt that can operate the level he does,” Smith said at the end of last season. “The leadership, the real leadership that goes on behind the scenes. The way he prepares. He’s the same guy every day. That’s a huge compliment to him.” The Colts’ move opens up fresh questions about the future of Baker Mayfield, who is almost certainly on his way out of the Browns after they acquired Watson. Mayfield had reportedly favored Indianapolis as his next team after Cleveland but that possibility has disappeared with the Colts’ move for Ryan. Matt Ryan’s trade will incur a dead cap hit of $40.525M for the Falcons, the largest dead cap hit in NFL history by nearly $7M. According to the NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo Atlanta intend to pursue Marcus Mariota to replace Ryan.

3/22/2022,"The US’s top financial watchdog proposed on Monday that publicly traded companies report information on their greenhouse-gas emissions and even those of their suppliers and consumers in one of the Biden administration’s most sweeping environmental actions to date. The new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules faces staunch opposition from some politicians and members of the business community and will be open to public comment for at least two months before final rules are released. “I am pleased to support today’s proposal because, if adopted, it would provide investors with consistent, comparable and decision-useful information for making their investment decisions, and it would provide consistent and clear reporting obligations for issuers,” said the SEC chair, Gary Gensler. The proposal, which has been in the works for over a year, would force companies to make public the extent of their carbon footprint. While some companies including Apple and Microsoft now publish detailed analyses of their emissions, others have been reluctant to improve disclosure. Under the proposal publicly traded companies would have to report greenhouse-gas emissions and obtain independent certification of their estimates. Some companies would also be required to report emissions from both their supply chains and consumers, known as Scope 3 emissions. Republicans and some industry groups have already begun lobbying against the new requirements, which they argue would increase costs and go beyond the SEC’s mandate. In a speech last year Gensler said the rules would introduce consistency to company reporting at a time when investors were increasingly concerned about the impact of climate on businesses. “Today, investors increasingly want to understand the climate risks of the companies whose stock they own or might buy. Large and small investors, representing literally tens of trillions of dollars, are looking for this information to determine whether to invest, sell, or make a voting decision one way or another. Investors are looking for consistent, comparable, and decision-useful disclosures so they can put their money in companies that fit their needs,” he said.",News/Business,US watchdog plans to make companies reveal greenhouse-gas emissions,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/21/sec-greenhouse-gas-emissions-carbon-proposal
3/22/2022,"Do you feel lucky? That was the subliminal message of Alexander Novak when Russia’s deputy prime minister channeled his inner Clint Eastwood to warn the west of the consequences of extending its sanctions to his country’s oil. No question, there was a hint of both bravado and desperation as Novak said it was possible – although not likely – that the cost of crude could hit $300 (£227) a barrel. The measures imposed since the invasion of Ukraine are starting to bite. Even so, just like the cop Eastwood plays in Dirty Harry, Novak knows what a lot of politicians across western Europe are thinking: abandoning Russia as a source of energy supply is far from costless. Starting with the obvious, rising prices for oil and gas threaten to intensify cost of living crises across the west. It is a basic rule of economics that if the supply of something is reduced the price will go up until such point as the cost become prohibitive. At that point, there is a drop in demand that forces down prices, which is why each peak in oil prices has been followed by a slump. It seems unlikely – given differing views among member states – that the EU is ready yet to broaden its sanctions to include oil and gas. But unless the war ends soon energy prices will remain high, eating deep into profits and consumer spending power. A second problem is how to make up for the loss of Russian energy while at the same time meeting net zero commitments. In the medium and long term, the answer is obvious: western nations need to accelerate the transition out of fossil fuels and into renewables and the invasion of Ukraine will give added momentum to that trend. In the short term, though, governments keen to keep the lights on and to keep transport systems running will seek to replace Russian fossil fuels with fossil fuels from other parts of the world. That makes sense, because energy shortages would cause a serious recession in the west, and in the past economic downturns have led to a waning of interest in green issues. That hasn’t happened so far but there is a real risk that it might. Clearly, this is a messy compromise. More progress should have been made sooner on the green energy transition but it wasn’t. It would have been helpful had politicians yoked together recovery from the pandemic and net zero plans in a more meaningful way, but they didn’t. Given how things stand it may be a case of two steps forward, one step back. Kwasi Kwarteng says the government is angry and disappointed by the decision of P&O Ferries to sack 800 staff and replace them with cheap contract labour. Not to be outdone in the condemnation stakes, Rishi Sunak calls the company’s behaviour appalling, awful and wrong. This is bluster. Kwarteng’s business department knew what P&O planned 24 hours before the news was announced. The chancellor is happy enough for P&O’s parent company, the Dubai-based DP World, to continue investing in the freeports so dear to his heart. In his letter to P&O, Kwarteng stressed that the company could face an unlimited fine for failing to go through the proper consultation process. In other words, it is all right to replace British workers and replace them with cheap foreign labour provided you warn them first. The reality is that ministers have been caught with their trousers down. Having promised but failed to deliver an employment bill, the P&O case shows exactly why tougher protection for workers is needed. The cost of a barrel of Brent crude oil hit $138 two weeks ago. Since then, it briefly dipped below $100 a barrel and is currently trading at $114 a barrel – about $25 a barrel below its recent peak. Motorists would struggle to find any evidence of lower crude prices. As the AA points out, wholesale petrol prices were down 12p a litre on the 8 March peak but the retail price at the pump was 9p dearer. Funny how markets work in such an asymmetric way. Anybody would think the retailers were taking their customers for a ride.",News/Business,Finding fossil fuel alternative to Russian oil and gas makes short-term sense,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/mar/21/finding-fossil-fuel-alternative-to-russian-oil-and-gas-makes-short-term-sense
3/22/2022,"A 96-year-old man who survived a string of Nazi concentration camps including Buchenwald and Bergen-Belsen has been killed by an explosion during the Russian assault on the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, a spokesperson for the Buchenwald concentration camp memorial foundation has confirmed. “We are shocked to confirm the violent death of Boris Romanchenko, whose niece informed us on Monday morning that he died last Friday after a bomb or rocket hit the multistorey building where he lived in Kharkiv and his apartment was burned out,” a spokesperson told the Guardian. According to regional emergency services, more than 500 people have been killed in Kharkiv since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. Born in 1926 to a farming family in the village of Bondari outside the city of Sumy in north-eastern Ukraine, Romanchenko was taken as a prisoner of war after the German Nazi regime launched Operation Barbarossa against the Soviet Union in 1941. “The war had completely surprised us, I wasn’t able to flee,” he recalled in an interview in April 2004. In 1942, he was deported to Dortmund, in Germany’s industrial Ruhr valley, to work as forced labourer in a mine. After attempting to escape, he was seized just as he was about to board an east-bound train and was then deported to Buchenwald concentration camp in January 1943. Romanchenko was later moved to Peenemünde on the Baltic Sea island of Usedom, where he was made to work on the V2 rocket programme, as well as Mittelbau-Dora and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps. Romanchenko said he was liberated from Bergen-Belsen by British and American allied forces on 14 April 1945 just before he and other survivors were due to be killed by being fed poisoned food. He was enlisted to the Soviet army for five years after the end of the war. Afterwards, he began to play an active part in institutions that commemorate the Holocaust, acting for several years as vice-president for Ukraine on the international committee at the Buchenwald-Doramemorial foundation. He attended several commemorative events at the camp’s former site and had been invited to attend an event marking the Buchenwald liberation this year. In 2015, he read out the “Oath of Buchenwald”, a survivors’ pledge dating back to the camp’s liberation, in Russian. “Our goal is to build a new world of peace and freedom,” he read.",News/World news,"Russian attack on Kharkiv kills Holocaust survivor, 96",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/21/russian-attack-on-kharkiv-kills-holocaust-survivor-96
3/22/2022,"The Dubai-based owner of P&O Ferries is set to benefit from at least £50m of UK taxpayer support as part of the government’s freeport programme, raising questions over its role in the scheme after the sacking of 800 workers. DP World, the Emirati logistics giant behind P&O, runs the UK’s second and third-biggest shipping terminals at Southampton and London Gateway – locations among the first 12 freeports in the UK to be picked by the government last year as a flagship part of its levelling up agenda. Under the plans, each site will receive £25m of seed capital funding from the public purse to upgrade infrastructure, as part of the scheme championed by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak. Each location also benefits from tax breaks designed to encourage business investment, economic growth and job creation, with an upfront cost to taxpayers’ worth £500m over five years for all 12 freeports. However, trade union leaders and opposition MPs questioned whether DP World should play a role in the programme after the sacking without notice of 800 P&O seafarers last week. Mick Lynch, the general secretary of the RMT trade union, said: “It’s beyond belief that a company which has treated British workers in such a brutal and callous fashion could still be in the frame for a £50m windfall from the British taxpayer. The government should be banning and sanctioning this bunch of corporate oligarchs in the strongest possible fashion until they reinstate the sacked workforce.” Under the freeport programme in Scotland and Wales, operators are required to demonstrate plans for high quality employment and fair work practices – including the payment of the real living wage, as part of measures imposed by the devolved governments. However, the UK government did not pursue similar rules for English freeports, leading to criticisms of the scheme. The government insists UK employment laws apply across the country, including in freeports. “People are horrified with what they’ve seen at P&O,” said Andy McDonald, the Labour MP for Middlesbrough who counts the Teesside freeport within his constituency. “There’s no conditionality about this whatsoever [at freeports]. It guarantees corporate profit. It’s corporate welfare on an industrial scale.” The former shadow employment rights secretary said the government needed to reconsider who it does business with. “All they [freeport operators] want is to extract value out of freeports and it’s not going to make a jot of difference to poverty, health, life expectancy or anything else. They’re going to take the money and run,” he said. As well as the benefits accruing from the freeports, DP World is set for significant UK government support for its African expansion plans. The UK will be the minority partner in a joint venture in three African ports – in Senegal, Egypt and Somaliland – that will be run by DP World, with an initial $320m (£242m) investment – the largest single investment that the UK’s investment arm has ever made. The sovereign wealth fund – known as CDC Group, shortly to be renamed British International Investments or BII – said last October it would be investing up to a further $400m in DP World ports and logistics operations in Africa. BII told the Financial Times last year that it had “a shared vision with DP World … Our investment allows them to stretch their dollar further, to do more”. A spokesperson for BII said the ports were “three of about 170 different businesses in which DP World has an interest. They are entirely separate, both operationally and financially, from the P&O Ferries business.” Last autumn DP World’s chair and chief executive, Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, announced a £300m investment in its London Gateway port at an event marking the commercial launch of the Thames freeport. DP World is also investing £40m at the port of Southampton. With posed photographs alongside the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, at the Savoy hotel in London, Bin Sulayem said the firm planned to be “at the heart of Britain’s trading future” and that its investment would boost economic growth, jobs and living standards. Sunak said at the time he was “thrilled” with the investment. A government spokesperson said: “The government has been clear that we are appalled by the way P&O have behaved towards their employees and Department for Transport ministers have raised this directly with P&O company chiefs. “We are working urgently to establish the facts of what has happened in this case, and whether P&O or DP World are in breach of any of the requirements on them as partners in the Thames and Solent freeports.” A spokesperson for DP World in the UK said: “Our operation at DP World Southampton will not directly receive any public funds as part of Solent freeport. “The £11m of infrastructure funding, for which we have applied at DP World London Gateway should be seen alongside the £300m we are investing in a new fourth berth at the site, and the further £1bn which has been earmarked for investment in the UK over the next 10 years.”",News/Business,P&O Ferries’ owner to benefit from at least £50m of UK freeport scheme,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/21/po-ferries-owner-to-benefit-from-at-least-50m-of-uk-freeport-scheme
3/22/2022,"The UK government has known for many years that if it paid a £400m debt to Iran it was likely to lead to the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the former Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt has said in a letter to the foreign affairs select committee. Burt, a Tory MP until 2019, is calling for the committee to launch an inquiry into why the debt was not paid and into who – either in the governments of the UK or the US – resisted making the payment. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 43, was released last week immediately after the UK paid the debt, and at a press conference on Monday she asked why it had taken five foreign secretaries and six years to secure her release. Burt also said he repeatedly urged the government to pay the £400m, which he said was “not a ransom, but a debt owed”. Burt was Middle East minister between 2017 and 2019, and says even now he is not sure what forces were preventing the debt’s payment. It is the first time a former minister has revealed so much about the clashes within government over the failure to secure Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s release earlier. It is understood Burt has told the committee he is prepared to give evidence in public or private. The £400m debt relates to a 1970s arms deal in which the UK took money from the Shah of Iran but then did not deliver the promised Chieftain tanks after he was deposed by Islamic revolutionaries. In his letter to the committee, Burt is careful to say he could not have known for sure if the payment would have led to the release of Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori, another dual national. But, he said, he did know from his discussions with senior Iranian ministers that payment represented a chance to open up a new relationship with Iran and “remove an impediment to the relationship and possibly their release”. He said he had reported to the then foreign secretary Boris Johnson (in office from 2016 to 2018) that from his dealings with the then Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, he understood that “payment of the debt was fundamental to their release”. Burt also said he knew there were practical difficulties in paying the debt because of US sanctions, but routes were explored including payment in humanitarian aid or through undertakings by the Iranian foreign ministry that the money would not go to the Iranian army. It is understood that Burt at one point formed a view that the defence secretary Gavin Williamson at the time was opposed to the payment and challenged him, leading to a row, but he never received a direct response. Other possible blockages were the US government led by Donald Trump. Burt has also let it be known that he would be happy for his ministerial papers showing his advocacy of paying the debt to be placed on the public record in front of any foreign affairs select committee inquiry. The foreign affairs committee has also been asked to launch an inquiry by Tulip Siddiq, the Labour MP for Hampstead, and the MP representing Richard Ratcliffe, the husband of Zaghari-Ratcliffe. Burt, an experienced and respected figure across the Middle East, is curious to know if the resistance was internal inside the government or came from the Trump administration. In his letter, he writes: “I believe now we need to find out who or what stopped the payments.” Ratcliffe has said he believes a parliamentary inquiry is the best route to finding the truth, as opposed to seeking judicial review. Ministers may be reluctant for an inquiry to take place if it starts to unearth the degree to which UK policy on Iran, and the fate of the dual nationals, was being dictated by pressure from the Trump administration. In a clue to the attitude of the Trump administration to payment of the debt, Mike Pompeo, secretary of state under Trump, last week accused Britain of paying blood money by clearing its debt.

3/22/2022,"In Washington on Monday, the Texas senator Ted Cruz complained that supreme court confirmation hearings have become increasingly angry and confrontational. In Bozeman, Montana the previous day, however, the Republican was filmed becoming angry and confrontational with airport staff and an armed police officer. A short video, appearing to have been shot from behind a check-in desk, was posted to Reddit. It showed the masked senator remonstrating with the two staff members, both women, and the male officer. It was not possible to hear what was said. A caption said: “Ted Cruz accosting airline employees today at BZN after missing his flight. Law enforcement had to be called when he wouldn’t calm down.” An airport official told the Daily Mail the senator missed his check-in window for a flight and became “frustrated” as other options were limited due to spring break traffic. “One of our public safety officers was in the ticket lobby and was asked to assist with a frustrated passenger at the United ticket counter (which is not unusual),” said Scott Humphrey, the Bozeman airport deputy director. “Once travel options were explained to the passenger, he was rebooked and departed Bozeman later that evening. Our [officer] didn’t realise he was dealing with Senator Cruz until after the fact.” Cruz made it to Washington for the opening on Monday of hearings for Ketanji Brown Jackson, Joe Biden’s first supreme court nominee. The senator did not immediately comment about his experience at Bozeman airport. Critics online did. Rick Wilson, a former Republican operative and co-founder of the anti-Trump Lincoln Project, said: “Ted Cruz getting aggro with airline counter folks is so very on-brand. ‘Well, sir, if you don’t like your flight options, we can drive you to the train station.’” Keith Olbermann, a writer and TV host, said: “So Ted Cruz was apparently so out-of-control abusive to airline staff at the airport in Bozeman, Montana, that law enforcement had to get involved. It must’ve been snowing.” That was a reference to events in Texas and Mexico last year, when Cruz left his state during a lethal big freeze to fly out for a family break in Cancun. Amid controversy, Cruz admitted his mistake and flew home. Online, some altered Donald Trump’s old nickname for his rival, Lyin’ Ted, to call the senator Flyin’ Ted instead. Responding to coverage of his Cancun escapade, Cruz said: “Here’s a suggestion. Just don’t be assholes.

Meyer’s reign in Jacksonville lasted just 13 games as he became the latest successful college coach to fail in the NFL. According to The Athletic, Meyer told the Jaguars he has researched NFL players extensively as he prepared to step up to the professional game. However, it soon became apparent his knowledge was barely above the level of the most casual of NFL fans. Sources said Meyer was unaware of Pro Bowl players such as Jamal Adams and Deebo Samuel and, most damning, appeared to be unfamiliar with arguably the most talented player in the league, three-time defensive player of the year Aaron Donald. According to one source, Meyer asked: “Who’s this 99 guy on the Rams? I’m hearing he might be a problem for us.” During preseason he insulted a room full of players by saying they would not be able to get a job for “$15 an hour” if he cut them. In another meeting he reduced one player to tears and one member of the Jaguars was so incensed by the incident that he reportedly confronted the coach about it the following day. According to wide receiver DJ Chark, no one at the Jaguars felt safe during Meyer’s tenure. “He feels like threats are what motivates,” Chark told The Athletic. “I know he would come up to us and tell us if the receivers weren’t doing good, he wasn’t going to fire us, he was going to fire our coach. He would usually say that when the coach was around.” A veteran staff member described Meyer’s time in charge as “the most toxic environment I’ve ever been a part of.” Meyer would also reportedly blame his own unpopular coaching decision on his staff rather than taking responsibility himself. In January, Meyer admitted he had failed at the Jaguars. “It was the worst experience I’ve had in my professional lifetime,” Meyer said in an appearance on Don’t @ Me with Dan Dakich. “What really got me, I almost don’t want to say people accept it, I mean, you lose a game, and you just keep ... I would seriously have self-talk. I went through that whole depression thing too, where I’d stare at the ceilings and [think] ‘Are we doing everything possible?’ because I really believed we had a roster that was good enough to win games. I just don’t think we did a great job.” One of Meyer’s most damning decisions came following a Thursday night game at Cincinnati last September. He chose to stay behind with family instead of flying home with his team and then was caught on video the following night behaving inappropriately with a woman at a bar in Columbus, Ohio. Jaguars owner Shad Khan publicly reprimanded Meyer at the time, saying he needed to regain the owner’s trust and respect.",Sport/Sport,"‘Who’s this 99 guy?’: Meyer didn’t recognize NFL stars during Jags reign, says report",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/21/urban-meyer-aaron-donald-jacksonville-jaguars-nfl-football-coach
3/22/2022,"Polly Toynbee suggests that her lucky generation of homeowners with work pensions should be targeted to provide much-needed assistance for those less fortunate (Pensioner poverty is at a new high – so why are older people still voting Tory?, 18 March). As someone who relies on a work pension (and who has never voted Tory), might I point out that I and millions of others pay tax on this pension in the same way as I have done all my adult life. Also, like many people in a similar situation, I use this modest pension to help support adult children who are either forced to rent privately or are required to pay an arm and a leg to get on the property ladder. Unfortunately, Toynbee appears to be falling into the HMRC trap of hitting a captive audience (AKA shooting fish in a barrel) while properly redistributive wealth taxes, windfall taxes and accountable public control of energy and infrastructure remain comfortably bedded in their “too difficult” boxes.Ian FraserNewtown, Powys  Polly Toynbee wonders “how to lever some of the unearned wealth out of my lucky generation of homeowners with old-fashioned work pensions and redistribute it … ” Many better-off pensioners will argue that they worked hard all their lives and contributed to a pension fund, so they are entitled to a comfortable old age. There is probably little to be gained from responding that millions of people, particularly women, also worked hard all their lives in low-wage jobs but had no possibility of a work pension or house purchase. But it’s not necessary to appeal to altruism. It’s in our own interest as we get older to pay a bit more tax if we can afford it, given our increasing reliance on public services. It would take some of the burden off our children and grandchildren and leave more of the tax take for poverty relief. There is no magic money tree, nor is there a magic doctor tree. If we want to grow more doctors, we must invest more in education and health, and better-off pensioners need to chip in.Janet DobsonYork  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Could this possibly be my renewed driving licence that I had requested (as directed) via DVLA Swansea and acknowledged by it on 22 June 2021? It was instead the DVLA registration certificate for a car that I had bought three days earlier, swiftly noting its acquisition and documenting all amendments provided. I cannot understand how two departments of the DVLA could be operating with such different levels of efficiency. This suggests that the agency requires a shake-up in management to ease the problems that motorists have been facing.

3/22/2022,"One of the largest Facebook groups matching Ukrainian refugees with UK host families has warned of the dangers of infiltration posed by Russian trolls and traffickers. Room for Ukrainians in the UK is a Facebook group that was set up little over two weeks ago and already has 12,500 members. Most of those posting are Ukrainians in need of sponsors and British people who want to open their homes to the new arrivals. However, the founder of the group, Diana Shore, 57, an assistant professor at a UK university, said that alongside generous offers of help, she is also having to tackle Russian trolls trying to infiltrate the group. She has also raised concerns about traffickers taking advantage of the lack of government regulation and oversight of the Homes for Ukraine scheme. Shore has called on Facebook to step up and use the same kind of software used by online dating agencies that identifies the geographical location of a person posting messages, so that trolls in Russia or elsewhere who try to damage and disrupt the site can be more easily spotted and barred. Her call comes as a Russian court banned Facebook and Instagram from doing business in Russia on the grounds that its parent company, Meta, is an “extremist organisation”. At the moment, Shore is having to resort to searching the profiles of people who have posted suspicious things for any mention of “Russia”. Not everyone with malign intent will necessarily be Russian or use the word Russia in their Facebook profiles so it is not always possible to identify trolls among the 12,500 group members. While Shore has hailed the success of those in the group – at least 50 Ukrainian families have been matched with UK sponsors – she has urged Facebook and the government to do more to ensure the site is secure. She has also urged those using the group to register with the government scheme and has posted safeguarding notices in Russian and Ukraine on the site. Shore said that offensive posts in the group include those that urge Ukrainian men who have asked for accommodation to go back to their country irrespective of their age, health and other circumstances, and abusive comments that refer to Ukrainian women as “whores”. Shore said she set up the group because she felt she had to do something to help. “This is a tragedy on a par with the second world war,” she said. “I didn’t feel it was OK to stand aside. My grandfather helped liberate Belsen concentration camp. He was driving one of the first lorries that got in there at the end of the war. My target was to find 50 homes for refugees and we’ve done that.” “Only the government has the capacity to provide a safe matching service,” she added. “At the moment it is being left to charities and social media. Modern slavery and trafficking are disasters waiting to happen. The matching process needs to be regulated as a matter of urgency with oversight from an independent Ofsted-style regulator. “Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg needs to step up. I want to protect this site. I need to be able to identify people with malicious intentions more easily so they can be blocked. Social media has also been a force for good too with the Ukraine war. Humanity is linking arms across politics, across borders and across languages.” Facebook and the Home Office have been approached.",News/World news,Trolls and traffickers target Facebook group for Ukrainian refugees,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/21/trolls-and-traffickers-target-facebook-group-for-ukrainian-refugees
3/22/2022,"Now obviously 2022 is already an unsalvageable trainwreck and, between the prospect of crippling widespread poverty and all-out nuclear armageddon, none of us have much mental space left for lesser concerns. Having said that, is anyone else getting mighty ticked off with all the grifter shows on TV? All of a sudden they are everywhere. The Tinder Swindler was a grifter show. Inventing Anna was a grifter show. Worst Roommate Ever was a grifter show. Bad Vegan is a grifter show. WeCrashed is a grifter show. The Dropout is a grifter show. All these shows have been released in the last few weeks. Slump down on your sofa at the end of another long day spent fretting for the future of humanity, and there’s a good chance you will end up watching a series about a charismatic villain doing their best to rip off the vulnerable. We’re reaching epidemic level here, which is obviously the last thing we need. What makes things worse is that, to put it politely, almost every show I have mentioned is absolute cack. Worst Roommate Ever was a dreary by-the-numbers true crime doc. Inventing Anna appeared to be the result of several alarmingly bad decisions, in that it was primarily a show about the world’s most annoying journalist (and there’s tough competition) fretting about her career while the actual story happened in the background. WeCrashed is a bad movie stretched out into a tortuously long series to, I guess, punish humanity for its crimes. Only The Dropout, the Disney+ Theranos series, stands as competent. But who has the enthusiasm for yet another grifter show in a sea of them? Why are there so many all of a sudden? What have we done to deserve this miserable glut? They might be simply a reflection of the times in which we live. Things are bad for everyone, and swiftly getting worse, so there’s something alluring about television shows in which we can watch brazen baddies indulging in the get-rich-quick schemes that most of us only dream about. We’re all chumping along, putting in joyless shifts for pennies, for companies that don’t care a jot about our welfare – but these people are on a rocket ship to the moon. There’s something genuinely seductive about the story of Inventing Anna’s antihero, Anna Delvey, about the self-confidence she must have had to live so large on nothing but charm and promises. There’s something fascinating about the ability of The Dropout’s Elizabeth Holmes’s to attract unimaginable amounts of money for an idea that didn’t actually work. Perhaps, deep down, we all wish we had the balls to carry off scams like these. Or maybe we enjoy the fall from grace. All these shows, after all, are about people who were eventually found out, and allow us the visceral dopamine hit of watching as these grifters are punished for breaking the rules. The only reason to watch WeCrashed (and this isn’t a good enough reason, by the way, so don’t actually watch it) is for the part where the whole overinflated, overvalued WeWork empire starts to collapse. It’s the fall of Rome, but in miniature and worse because Jared Leto is in it. On the other hand, I have a theory about why this type of show has gained so much traction so quickly. My theory is that it’s all down to true crime run-off. The true crime genre has been at saturation point for years now, to the extent that every murder to have happened anywhere in the world over the last 75 years now has its own six-part Netflix series. There are so many murder shows that it is now impossible to surprise anyone. They have all started to blend into one, hitting all of the same beats at exactly the same time. A chimp could make a murder show at this point. And so we have simply moved down the ladder. Now that murder is passé, it’s time for murky financial dealings to have a moment in the spotlight. After all, they encompass many of murder’s basic moves – deception, sociopathy, a desire not to be caught – except people just end up monetarily ruined, instead of dead. I think this is just the start. Six months from now, this deluge of grifter shows will look like a trickle. They will be even more infuriatingly ubiquitous. After that, we’ll move down the ladder again. What I’m trying to say is that this fad for grifter shows is annoying, but give it a couple of years and it will seem like heaven compared to all the true crime shows about petty shoplifting we’ll have to sit through.",Arts/Television & radio,Stop making TV about scams!

3/22/2022,"The crowd keeps coming, the full length of the Duveen Galleries in Tate Britain. Many on foot, some on horseback, some carried, one in a wheelchair. Men and women and children, little drummers, people in Dogon masks and mantillas, others wearing ferocious animal heads or looking like the Creature from the Black Lagoon. There are demons and skulls, conical penitential caps, fantastical millinery, faces covered in stars and others decorated with flowers, a child with an old man’s face, others who look like they have been ravaged by disease or injured by war. Heavily pregnant women, women in cubist cardboard skirts, delicate faces cut and folded and faceted from card, people with their arms spread like dancers, figures with flowers in their hair and women all in black and in upholstered skirts who might have stepped out of a Velázquez painting. We pass by guys in sharp suits, and others who might have stepped out of a ball, but besmirched from wading through a flood. It is a crazy journey, stilled the length of Tate Britain’s spine. The Procession, Hew Locke’s 2022 Tate Britain Commission, is at times as joyful as it is filled with sorrows. By far the most accomplished, ambitious and fascinating work I have seen by the 62-year-old artist, the work includes around 150 figures, each one individuated and wearing a hand-sewn and crafted costume. The Procession roars the length of the gallery. Among much else, it shows what an artist of Locke’s ambition can achieve when given sufficient resources to work at full stretch. This is all more than fancy dress, although carnival itself takes pleasure in plays of time and place. Stilt-walkers and confraternities of hooded penitents, figures in mantles, capes, army camouflage, Easter Virgins and saints supported on catafalques and floats, as if at Holy Week; the dressed-up, the dressed down, a tatterdemalion mob, and a celebration or a funeral march. Banners and medallions, dubloons and pearls, clothing and banners decorated with company share certificates and promissory notes and pictures of the ruined and decaying houses of plantation owners – The Procession is consciously, deliriously excessive, but as orchestrated as a pageant. Edinburgh-born, raised in Guyana and living between London and Cornwall, Locke remembers a Tate briefing before the 2015 Artists and Empire exhibition, which trivialised the fact that Henry Tate made his money not simply through the sugar trade, but through the legacy of slavery. Tate’s collection, which formed the basis of the gallery’s holdings, was put together, the gallery made clear, after the abolition of the slave trade. Locke, who was included in the exhibition, was deeply uncomfortable about the gallery’s rewriting of its own past. It was a comfortable origin story. The Procession unpacks some of this problematic history, as well as taking Caribbean carnival, the story of post-colonial trade, empire and the current environmental disaster in its stride. Past and present collide and intermingle, throwing up echoes and asides. A mix of Junkanoo and Guyanese Mashramani carnivals, protest and celebration, defiance and redress, The Procession is endlessly captivating and overwhelming. In terms of its complexity, I was reminded both of Mark Wallinger’s 2007 State Britain, installed in the same spaces, and of Bahamian artist Tavares Strachan’s 2020 In Plain Sight at London’s Marian Goodman Gallery, which, like The Procession, takes Caribbean carnival (and in particular Bahamian and Jamaican Junkanoo) as a major reference point. Other references in the work abound – from John Singleton Copley’s 1783 painting The Death of Major Peirson (parts of the image cover one character’s costume) to James Ensor’s 1888 Christ’s Entry into the City of Brussels, with its crazed mob. Since the suppression of African religions across the Caribbean in the 19th century, carnival has been a kind of safety valve, a world turned upside down, a release, and an assertion of identity, including such figures as Mother Sally, the Midnight Robber and Sailor Mas, whose names and roles and origins have their roots in folklore and religion. Neither picturesque nor a diversion, The Procession makes its way from the past into the future, from old wounds to new terrors, and everything in between. Hew Locke: The Procession is at the Duveen Galleries, Tate Britain, London, from 22 March to 22 January.",Arts/Art and design,‘A roaring carnival of humanity’ – Hew Locke: The Procession review,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/21/hew-locke-the-procession-review-tate-britain-carnival
