A patient’s unexpected death during a study has given us the first recording of a dying human brain. Scientists managed to capture the unique event while monitoring the brain waves of an 87-year-old-epilepsy patient. During the study, the patient experienced a heart attack and died while still being monitored. It’s a unique situation and one that has given us a new glimpse into how the brain reacts at the time of death.

While the study wasn’t designed to record a dying human brain, it did give us some great insight. The researchers recorded around 15 minutes of brain activity surrounding the time that the heart stopped beating. To see how the brain reacts at death, though, they focused on two 30 second intervals surrounding the exact time that the heart stopped. Upon inspection, they discovered gamma oscillations in the recording. Gamma oscillations are brainwaves we associate with dreaming, memory retrieval, and meditation. As such, the phrase “my whole life flashed before my eyes” might be that far off. Based on what they saw in the recordings, the researchers say that the brain may actually play a recall of important events in our lives when we die. It’s an interesting concept, and one that many have believed for years anyway. To see it finally solidified with scientific research is exciting, though. While exciting, the results of this study have also brought about some additional questions. For one, Dr. Ajmal Zemmar, the lead author of the study, says that the findings challenge our understanding of when life ends (via New Atlas). It also raises some important questions regarding the time that organs are harvested for donation, too. The research shows that the mind continues to work in a dying human brain, even when the blood has stopped flowing to it. This means its capable of coordinated activity even after death. This isn’t the first time we’ve seen these kinds of waves in dying brains, though. We’ve also previously seen these waves in dying rats. However, this is the first time we’ve seen it in a dying human brain. Which makes it even more intriguing. This is just a single case study, though. For any definitive results, we would need to have access to a much larger pool of information. Even then, there are other factors to consider, too. This patient suffered from epilepsy, though. As such, the results from other dying human brains could be quite different. The researchers have said they hope to continue studying the process. The researchers published a paper on the research in the journal Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience. Click here to read the full article.

2/28/2022,"Elizaveta Peskova posted the words ""no to war"" to an Instagram Live, according to Russian reports. Peskova's father is Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, who justifies Russia's actions to the media. The slogan is the same chanted by Russian protesters who marched in its cities this week. The daughter of President Vladimir Putin's spokesman posted an anti-war slogan in her Instagram Live on Friday, according to multiple reports. Elizaveta Peskova, 24, posted ""HET BOЙHE"" — ""no to war,"" against a black background on her Instagram story according to a screenshot tweeted by the Russian outlet TV Rain. This slogan is the main chant used by Russian protesters to oppose the invasions of Ukraine. Peskova is the daughter of Dmitry Peskov, the most prominent spokesperson working for the Kremlin. Peskov routinely gives statements justifying Russia's actions and attacking the US and its allies. Francis Scarr, a senior digital reporter at the BBC, also noted Peskova's posting in a tweet. Soon after Scarr posted the screenshot, Washington Post reporter Mary Ilyushina said that it had been taken down. Insider was unable to find it, which is consistent with a deletion. —Mary Ilyushina (@maryilyushina) February 25, 2022 The incident is likely to be deeply embarrassing to Peskov and Putin's wider circle. Aside from the president himself, Peskov is among the most high-ranking and visible people in the Russian president's orbit, and robustly defended Thursday's decision to invade Ukraine. Peskov spoke bullishly on Friday about ""retaliatory measures"" from Russia in reaction to the recently-imposed sanctions from the West, according to state-run TASS News agency. This is not the first time Peskova has prompted political intrigue. In 2o19 it emerged that she had become an intern for a right-wing MEP, Aymeric Chauprade, prompting concerns that sensitive political information could filter back to the Kremlin, the BBC reported. Peskova did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.
