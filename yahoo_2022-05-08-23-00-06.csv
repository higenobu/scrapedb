5/8/2022,"Roscosmos chief Dmitry Rogozin claimed NATO countries could be quickly destroyed in a nuclear war. The Russian space agency leader said on Telegram that Russia could destroy them in ""half an hour."" In the same post, he urged his country not to take such a step, however. The head of Russian space agency Roscomos has claimed his country could quickly destroy NATO countries if a nuclear war was to take place. Dmitry Rogozin, who has made many outlandish and provocative comments in recent months, shared the message in Russian on his Telegram channel on Sunday. He claimed that the destruction could happen in 30 minutes. ""But we must not allow it, since the consequences of an exchange of nuclear strikes will affect the state of our Earth,"" he added. ""Therefore, we will have to defeat this economically and militarily more powerful enemy by conventional military means,"" Rogozin continued. In February, Russian president Vladimir Putin put Russia's nuclear deterrent forces on high alert amid the sweeping sanctions the US and EU have taken against it. NATO posted a statement on its website in April, saying that the organization ""condemns in the strongest possible terms Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine — which is an independent, peaceful and democratic country, and a close NATO partner."" It continued: ""The Alliance calls on President Putin to stop this war immediately, withdraw all his forces from Ukraine without conditions and engage in genuine diplomacy."" Rogozin wrote in his Telegram post: ""NATO is waging war against us. It has not declared it, but it doesn't change anything. Now it's obvious to everyone."" In April, Rogozin said Roscosmos would leave the International Space Station and that the decision had already been affirmed. He also criticized the litany of Western economic sanctions imposed on Russia. ""I believe that the restoration of normal relations between partners in the International Space Station and other joint projects is possible only with the complete and unconditional lifting of illegal sanctions,"" he tweeted in April. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, the US — along with the European Union and the UK — have ramped up sanctions against Moscow, Putin, and many individuals in the leader's inner circle. Rogozin added in his Telegram message that the war, which Putin called a ""special military operation,"" had gone ""far beyond its original meaning and geography,"" and called it ""a war for the truth and the right of Russia to exist as a single and independent state."" Scholars, however, have debunked Putin's many attempts at justifying the war, including that he aimed to ""denazify"" Ukraine. They told NPR that Putin's language was offensive and factually wrong. One of the experts, Laura Jockusch, said: ""There is no 'genocide,' not even an 'ethnic cleansing' perpetrated by the Ukraine against ethnic Russians and Russian-speakers in the Ukraine. It is a fiction that is used by Putin to justify his war of aggression on the Ukraine."" Jockush added in her email to NPR that using the word ""denazification"" was also ""a reminder that the term 'Nazi' has become a generic term for 'absolute evil' that is completely disconnected from its original historical meaning and context.""

5/8/2022,"Putin is convinced that ""doubling down"" will help Russia turn the tide in Ukraine, CIA director William Burns said. Putin may redouble his efforts because he ""doesn't believe he can afford to lose,"" Burns said, per CBS News. Russia has failed to make ground in the Donbas region, and reports say military morale is low. Russian President Vladimir Putin is set to redouble his efforts in Ukraine despite his army's flagging offensive, CIA director William Burns said on Saturday, per CBS News. ""I think he's convinced right now that doubling down still will enable him to make progress,"" Burns said at the Financial Times' Weekend Festival, CBS News reported. The Russian leader is in ""a frame of mind in which he doesn't believe he can afford to lose,"" Burns continued, according to CBS News. Putin has already ""staked a lot"" on the second phase of the Ukrainian offensive, Burns added, which has seen Russia refocus its military efforts on the south and east of Ukraine. Burns' comment that Putin will double down comes amid reports of low morale among Russian soldiers and the Pentagon's assessment, last week, that his forces are ""behind schedule."" Russia's invasion of Ukraine is now concentrated primarily in the Donbas region. After 10 weeks, Russian troops have still failed to take control of any major cities. Ukrainian resistance is stiff, with analysts telling BBC News that Ukraine's military operation is turning into a successful counter-offensive. Putin's ""biggest mistake"" throughout the invasion, Burns said, was to ""underestimate the Ukrainians."" The Russian leader is now trying ""to adapt some of the lessons from the failures of the first phase,"" Burns said, per CBS News. Some Western officials expect that Putin will make a big announcement on May 9, designed to show Russia's strength ahead of the symbolic Victory Day military parade. There are reports that he intends to formally declare all-out war on Ukraine, which Russia has so far referred to as a ""special military operation."" Other reports indicate that Putin might introduce general mobilization. ""We don't see, as an intelligence community, practical evidence at this point of Russian planning for deployment or even potential use of tactical nuclear weapons,"" Burns said, per CBS News. He added, however, that ""we can't take lightly those possibilities.""

5/8/2022,"Amber Heard said she “instantly” thought “of Kate Moss and stairs” when she recounted a fight with Johnny Depp involving her sister Whitney. On the stand on Thursday in the defamation trial between the two actors, Ms Heard walked through one of many fights between herself and Mr Depp, with this one taking place in March 2015. Ms Heard said she threw a can of Red Bull towards Mr Depp, which struck him in the back, adding that she called him a “f****** p****”. She said he became enraged and followed her up a staircase. Ms Heard said he grabbed her, at which point her sister Whitney intervened. “She threw herself in the line of fire,” Ms Heard said. “She was trying to get Johnny to stop. Her back was to the staircase, and Johnny swings at her ... I don’t hesitate and wait, I instantly think of Kate Moss and stairs.” She said the thought led her to take action. “I, for the first time, hit him, square in the face. And he didn’t push my sister down the stairs. Up to that point in our relationship, I hadn’t even landed one on Johnny,” she said. “Johnny looked stunned and then laughed at me, and then lunges at me again,” she added, at which point security staff stepped in between them, according to Ms Heard. In the summer of 2020, Ms Heard claimed that Mr Depp pushed model Kate Moss down a staircase while they dated in the 1990s. During the 2020 UK libel trial between Mr Depp and The Sun newspaper, Ms Heard said, “He pushed Kate Moss down the stairs, I heard this from two people, and this was fresh in my mind”. “I reacted in defence of my sister. I had for years been Johnny’s punch bag but for years I never hit him. It was the first time after all these years that I struck him back,” she added at the time. The defamation trial between Mr Depp and Ms Heard began on 11 April in Fairfax, Virginia following Mr Depp’s lawsuit against his ex-wife in March 2019. Mr Depp is arguing that she defamed him in a December 2018 op-ed published in The Washington Post titled “I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture’s wrath. That has to change”. In her 2018 op-ed, Ms Heard wrote that “like many women, I had been harassed and sexually assaulted by the time I was of college age. But I kept quiet — I did not expect filing complaints to bring justice. And I didn’t see myself as a victim”. “Then two years ago, I became a public figure representing domestic abuse, and I felt the full force of our culture’s wrath for women who speak out,” she added at the time. While Mr Depp isn’t named in the piece, his legal team argues that it contains a “clear implication that Mr Depp is a domestic abuser”, which they say is “categorically and demonstrably false”. Mr Depp is seeking damages of “not less than $50m”. Ms Heard has filed a $100m counterclaim against Mr Depp for nuisance and immunity from his allegations.",World/The Independent,Amber Heard references previous claim Johnny Depp pushed Kate Moss down the stairs,https://news.yahoo.com/amber-heard-references-previous-claim-132434674.html
5/8/2022,"(Corrects spelling of name in first paragraph) By Peter Graff RYBNITSA, Transdniestria, Moldova (Reuters) -""Of course we're afraid,"" said pensioner Marina Martalog, walking across a long bridge over the Dniestr River to her home in Transdniestria, a pro-Russian breakaway sliver of Moldova along the border with Ukraine. ""Who isn't afraid of war?"" Alongside her, the bridge was choked with cars and trucks, backed up across the entire 400 metre span because of extra checks from Transdniestria's separatist authorities, who have announced a state of emergency after what they say was a week of terrorist attacks aimed at drawing the region into the Ukraine war next door. Reported shootings and explosions have turned the territory of Transdniestria - long an anomaly on the post-Soviet map rarely noticed by the outside world - into the subject of international speculation that the Ukraine war could spill over frontiers. Transdniestria's separatist authorities blame Ukraine for attacking their territory to provoke war with Russian troops based in the enclave. Since last week, they say attackers shot up their security agency headquarters, blew up two radio masts, and sent a number of drones across the frontier from Ukraine armed with explosives. ""The situation is alarming because Transdniestria has suffered terrorist attacks,"" Vitaly Ignatiev, foreign minister of the separatist administration, told Reuters this week in an interview by video link from his office in Tiraspol, the region's capital. ""Honestly, I don't see any reason why the Ukrainian side would use such methods against Transdniestria. Transdniestria does not threaten Ukraine,"" he said. ""I have said several times we are an absolutely peaceful state."" Ukrainian government officials have repeatedly denied any blame for the incidents in Transdniestria, saying they believed Russia was staging false-flag attacks to provoke war. Moscow, too, has denied blame, while saying it was concerned that Kyiv was trying to escalate. Moldova's pro-Western President Maia Sandu blamed the unrest on ""pro-war factions"" among the separatists. Reuters has been unable to independently verify who is behind the attacks. For Martalog and some other residents of Rybnitsa, a factory town on the left bank of a wide and gentle stretch of the Dniestr River, there was only an ominous sense of bewilderment. Around half a dozen residents interviewed by Reuters said they did not know what to believe. ""We leave the apartment, come home. Everyone sees the same thing: what they show on the television,"" said Martalog, returning to Rybnitsa after a visit with family on the Moldovan-held side. ""Who knows?"" The separatists who control the area say they have cancelled all foreign journalist accreditations under the state of emergency they imposed last week in the wake of the attacks. Reuters was granted permission to enter the region, provided no interviews were conducted or pictures taken during the visit. For this story, a reporter walked through Rybnitsa, observing the town, before exiting separatist territory and speaking with some of the many residents crossing the bridge. ALL QUIET Apart from the extra traffic on the bridge itself, there was little sign of an emergency. There were no checks at all on the other, Moldovan-held side of the bridge, where a single policeman sat in a booth. ""You see? It's all peaceful,"" said Andrei Duca, a Rybnitsa resident walking with his pre-school son on his shoulders across the bridge for a day-trip to the smaller, tidier town of Rezina controlled by Moldovan authorities on the right bank. ""If the situation were serious, they'd have shut the border altogether. There would be speedboats zooming up and down the river. You see? It's all quiet,"" he said. A small contingent of about 1,200 Russian soldiers has remained in Transdniestria since the breakup of the Soviet Union, guarding a huge weapons dump at the town of Cobasna, a short drive from Rybnitsa on the Ukrainian frontier. Last month, a Russian general said one of Moscow's war aims was to seize a swathe of southern Ukrainian territory to link up with Transdniestria. The remarks drew a formal protest from the Moldovan government. Inside separatist-held Rybnitsa, a fruit and veg market of covered stalls was humming, with fresh seasonal strawberries and mounds of fragrant tomatoes on sale. Shelves were full at a big, busy supermarket nearby. It was a sunny, clear day. Upriver, faint smoke could be seen above a huge cement factory, one of the many heavy industrial enterprises that have thrived in Transdniestria thanks to heavily subsidised Russian gas. Kayakers were paddling in the river by the quay on the separatist side. At a bus stop on the Moldovan side, Diana Blanari sat with a baby on her lap and a young daughter by her side. ""Of course you feel it, the people over there in Rybnitsa, they are afraid to suddenly be dragged into it. What with - where all the weapons are in Cobasna,"" she said. But she smiled and so did her daughter. ""I think it will be alright. We don't believe in rumours,"" she said.
