5/19/2022,"Scott Morrison’s loving embrace and financial backing of the gas industry has been a defining feature of his prime ministership. Hit with a historical pandemic, Morrison chose gas – not renewables – to fire an economic recovery. Plans to create a new hydrogen export industry will use gas. The government has – anachronistically in the face of the climate crisis – given fossil fuel a central role in reaching net zero which it claims to have a plan for, but in reality doesn’t. Unlike coal, gas doesn’t lend itself to being held up in parliament. But you suspect if Morrison could have, he would have. “We’ve got to get the gas,” he said in January 2019. His energy minister, Angus Taylor, has claimed exporting gas will cut emissions in the region. All of this flies in the face of multiple scientific studies and the International Energy Agency which all say there can be no more new gas developments if (and that “if” should really be in bold and CAPS) the worst of the climate crisis is to be avoided. But Morrison, Taylor and the gas industry consistently reach for a “get-out-of-catastrophe free” card in this game of Monopoly (climate crisis edition). That card is carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) – an expensive, complex and serially underperforming approach to grab CO2 where it’s being released and then lock it away, usually in geological formations underground. This week the chair of the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (Appea), Ian Davies, told his annual conference the industry “must meet” the challenge of decarbonisation, saying “the technology that’s critical for us to achieve this at scale is carbon capture, utilisation and storage – a proven technology”. While Davies said it was an approach first used by Exxon in the 1970s, the reality is that after billions of dollars in investment globally, this column has written how CCUS projects still only have the ability to capture about 0.3% of the emissions caused each year by burning fossil fuels. Australia only has one commercial carbon capture and storage facility operating – the Chevron-led Gorgon project at Barrow Island off Western Australia’s Pilbara coast. Gorgon is the world’s biggest carbon capture project that is dedicated to storing the CO2, which is different from the handful of larger projects where the CO2 is used to push more oil out of the ground. Davies told the conference Gorgon had stored 6m tonnes of CO2 since it started in mid-2019. “It’s working,” he said. This statement needs more than a little bit of qualification, because Gorgon has missed government-set targets for capturing CO2, and as a percentage of the emissions that will ultimately be released from that project, it can only marginally reduce the amount of extra CO2 that will be added to the atmosphere. Chevron Australia’s director of operations, Kory Judd, was a little less emphatic earlier this week, telling Reuters: “We’ve still got a ways to go to meet the commitment to what we have the injection system designed for. What we’re doing is trying to learn our way through how you inject CO2 into the reservoirs, how do they respond, then how do you do that reliably and how do you do that and get to the point to meeting the commitments that you’ve got.” At Gorgon, the CO2 that comes up with the gas when it’s drilled in offshore fields is extracted and injected underneath Barrow Island. But there have been several costly technical issues. In the last financial year, Gorgon injected 2.17m tonnes of CO2 – about 1m tonnes short of its target. After the CO2 is extracted, what’s left is mostly methane to be compressed to liquefied natural gas (LNG) and transported overseas where it is burned, releasing far more CO2 than is captured. How much more? One analysis from the Australia Institute suggested that if Gorgon was both injecting and producing gas at full capacity then over a five-year period, about 260m tonnes of CO2 will be emitted and only 20m tonnes captured. No matter what the claims, carbon capture and storage is not working at anywhere close to a scale that would significantly lower emissions – despite the billions in taxpayers’ cash thrown at it over the years. During his speech, the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (Appea) chair, Ian Davies, repeated a claim that Australia’s LNG had the potential to lower emissions “in importing countries by around 166m tonnes of carbon dioxide each year by replacing higher-emission fuels”. Appea told this column the 166 Mt figure is from the government’s long-term emissions reduction plan report. But that report does not say how the figure is calculated – just that it came from unpublished analysis by the department of industry. Temperature Check has asked the department how the figure was reached, but was told it couldn’t respond because the government was in caretaker mode. But when Taylor made a similar claim in 2019, the department said it was based on the assumption that all of the LNG exported by Australia was burned for power (but didn’t say what kind of gas plant it was burned in, as some are more efficient than others). They then compared that to the same amount of power if it was generated from burning coal. For this figure to be credible, all of the LNG exported would need to be burned and this would need to be displacing the use of coal, rather than just satisfying Asia’s rising demand for energy. “The figure is simply wrong. The idea that LNG is substituting coal is wrong. It’s not occurring,” said gas industry finance analyst Bruce Robertson of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a thinktank tracking the transformation of the world’s energy systems. Robertson said some LNG in Australia’s major markets of China and Japan is used for heating, not power generation. LNG is actually being displaced by renewables, he said, and most new LNG power plants in Asia are to cover short-term gaps in supply and are less efficient than those that have traditionally provided baseload power. Also not considered, said Robertson, is that if only about 2% of methane gas leaks from pipes along the supply chain then the climate impact of that potent greenhouse gas renders LNG just as bad, or worse, than coal. In what the Morrison government described as the dawn of a new energy export industry earlier this year, Morrison and Taylor were effusive over a world-first shipment of so called “clean hydrogen”. At the time, government media releases said if the pilot Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain project went commercial it would turn Latrobe Valley coal into hydrogen and “save” 1.8m tonnes of CO2 a year (which, by the way, is an unimpressive one-ninth of the emissions of the coal=fired power station that’s next door to the project). This column had asked HESC and the government how that 1.8 Mt was calculated, but got no answer. But now we know. Firstly, the government relied on information provided by HESC. In freedom of information documents, HESC said it simply compared two different methods of making hydrogen – one that uses gas in a process called steam methane reforming, and its own approach that gasifies coal. Actually, that’s not quite it. The kicker is that HESC compared the steam methane process without carbon capture (even though at least two plants, one in Texas and another in Alberta use steam methane with carbon capture), and its own process with carbon capture. That is not a fair comparison. On Sunday, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, repeated a claim that Australia’s record on emissions was much better than Canada and New Zealand, and better than the average of OECD countries. This is a claim this column has explored before. Putting aside falls in emissions from a slowing of land clearing in the last three decades – which the federal government has had nothing to do with – Australia’s emissions are not better than the OECD average. A detailed ABC Fact Check on Frydenberg’s most recent claims around Australia’s comparative record – one repeated on social media posts by the Liberal party – also found it “misleading”.",News/Environment,Gas industry and Coalition reach for a get-out-of-catastrophe-free card in climate crisis Monopoly | Temperature Check,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/19/gas-industry-and-coalition-reach-for-a-get-out-of-catastrophe-free-card-in-climate-crisis-monopoly
5/19/2022,"Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy used his nightly address to say that Russia’s alleged use of laser weapons systems “indicates the complete failure of the invasion” and that mistakes had been made at the highest level. He compared their use to propaganda efforts by Nazi Germany promoting a “wunderwaffe” or “wonder weapon”. Russia has claimed it is using a new generation of laser weapons to burn up drones. Zelenskiy said he had signed a decree to extend martial law by 90 days in order to allow further time to expel invasion forces. The decree needs to be approved by parliament. The World Bank will make $30bn available to help stem a food security crisis threatened by Russia’s war in Ukraine, which has cut off most grain exports from the two countries. The total will include $12bn in new projects and over $18bn funds from existing food and nutrition-related projects that have been approved but have not yet been disbursed, the bank said. Financial markets have endured another torrid day amid concerns that the war in Ukraine, along with inflation and supply problems, was pushing the world towards recession. In the US the Dow Jones average closed down 3.57% while the broader S&P500 suffered its worst session since June 2020, plunging 4.04%. A Russian tank commander has pleaded guilty to shooting dead a civilian on a bicycle, in Ukraine’s first trial for war crimes committed during the Russian invasion. Vadim Shysimarin, 21, has been accused of firing his AK-47 at a 62-year-old man from the window of a car in the north-eastern Sumy region in late February. Sweden and Finland have formally submitted their applications to join the Nato military alliance. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, accepted the Nordic neighbours’ membership applications. The United States will work with Finland and Sweden in the event of the ‘threat of aggression’ while the two countries’ Nato membership is being considered, president Joe Biden said. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said Sweden should not expect to approve its Nato application without returning ‘terrorists’. Ankara has accused Sweden and Finland of harbouring people it says are linked to groups it considers terrorists. A spokesperson for Erdoğan later said progress on Finland and Sweden’s Nato membership bids will only be possible if concrete steps are taken to address Turkey’s national security concerns. The European Commission has proposed an extra €9bn (£7.6bn) in EU loans to Ukraine to keep the country running as well as a €210bn plan for Europe to end its reliance on Russian fossil fuels by 2027. Zelenskiy said the €9bn support package would “help Ukraine win the war, overcome the consequences of Russian forces’ aggression and accelerate the movement towards EU membership”. Russia has expelled a total of 85 diplomatic staff from France, Spain and Italy in response to similar moves by those countries, its foreign ministry said. It said it was ordering out 34 embassy staff from France, 27 from Spain and 24 from Italy. The US embassy in Kyiv has resumed operations, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said after nearly three months of closure. A small number of diplomats will return initially to staff the embassy, according to a spokesperson. Russian forces occupying parts of north-eastern Ukraine early in the war subjected civilians to summary executions, torture, and other grave abuses that are apparent war crimes, Human Rights Watch said. The rights organisation documented 22 apparent summary executions, nine other unlawful killings, six possible enforced disappearances and seven cases of torture across 17 villages and small towns in the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions. At least 10 Ukrainian civilians, including two children, were killed by Russian forces Donetsk, regional governor Pavlo Kirilenko said.

5/19/2022,"Rangers had prepared for penalties, Giovanni van Bronkhorst admitted, but by the end of the Europa League final shootout they were defeated, their dream of a first European trophy in 50 years ended by Eintracht Frankfurt. Ryan Kent had what the Rangers head coach described as a “big, big” opportunity to win the trophy in the 118th minute before Aaron Ramsay missed the decisive spot-kick following a 1-1 draw in Seville. That left Van Bronkhorst likening the disappointment to what he had felt after losing the 2010 World Cup final and vowing that Rangers will do everything can to end the season with victory in Saturday’s Scottish Cup final. “If you play in a final and lose it hurts,” Van Bronkhorst said. “It went all the way to penalties and it’s a big disappointment. You’re so close to winning a trophy but that’s football. If you play finals you will have memories that stay with vou forever if you win. But if you lose it will hurt a lot. I lost a World Cup final, the biggest disappointment there is. But we have a big game on Saturday and then next season we have to start all over again.” “It’s not going to be easy to get them ready because emotionally we are hurt,” he added. “You see a lot of subs [were used]: it was tough physically, the players gave everything, they made every effort. As a coach that’s all you can ask. We had to sub some players because they were struggling physically. We have played a couple of times after just two days recovery. We had the biggest game of the year tonight and Saturday we have to be ready, but we will do it. We will be ready to finish with the trophy.” Van Bronkhorst admitted that one of the players he had been forced to withdraw was Borna Barisic, who had been lined up to take a penalty. He also said that he had put on Aaron Ramsay and Kemar Roofe on in order to take a spot kick. Roofe scored his, but Ramsay’s was saved, handing Eintracht an advantage that would prove decisive. “We prepared well the penalties,” the said. “[Ramsay] had to go and [take one] and he is one of the first takers. We trained the penalty kicks. Some players don’t need it. You want players who take penalties and are comfortable. We had a good few of players who wanted to take a penalty and others who didn’t. “We had our list but we also had to adjust it because of the subs. Aaron of course is disappointed but he took responsibility to take the penalty and you can make it or you can miss it. Unfortunately for us, he didn’t make it.” “You do everything you can to win it and with penalties it’s a lottery and tonight we were not on the good [lucky] side.”",Sport/Football,‘It hurts’: Van Bronkhorst insists Rangers injuries affected shootout plans,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/19/it-hurts-van-bronkhorst-insists-rangers-injuries-affected-shootout-plans
5/19/2022,"Of all the millions of words uttered on the hustings during this unedifying election campaign, few, if any, will be remembered as having soared to any great oratory heights. These days election stump speeches tend to be quickly devoured in the voracious churn of the perpetual news cycle, and largely parsed in disconnected chunks for their strategic and market-tested messaging rather than their cadences and artistry. Most of the party leaders’ transcribed speeches – and those of ministers and shadow ministers – are readily available. But few beyond pundits and political tragics would seek them out and read them for their craft or evocation of emotion. Sometimes a line or two from a leader’s campaign speech resonates – or echoes – to perhaps evoke something of a more optimistic, inspirational political epoch. So it was during Anthony Albanese’s campaign launch a couple of weeks ago, when my attention shifted from an AFL match on my laptop screen to the TV as the Labor leader was speaking. It was three words: “My fellow Australians.” I started paying attention. The echo in my memory said: “My fellow citizens.” It was the voice of Gough Whitlam and the line was from his 1972 Blacktown campaign launch, a speech regarded as one of the more memorable in the pantheon of Australian election orations, and exceptional even by Whitlam’s standards. In this speech Whitlam three times referred to “fellow citizens” and, a recent reading reminds me, he also emphatically referenced “my fellow Australians” towards the end. These repeated words set something of the rhetorical pace of this Whitlam stump speech. Just as Albanese’s repetition of “my fellow Australians” (he said it, with careful measure, seven times) set the meter of his speech, perhaps with the intent of evoking the anticipation and “it’s time” optimism of 1972. Structurally Albanese’s speech was not entirely dissimilar to Whitlam’s half a century ago (but don’t get me wrong; the former does not have the captivating oratory power of the latter). Sean Scalmer, a historian at the University of Melbourne and author of On the Stump – a book about campaign oratory in Australia, US and Britain – says the 1972 Whitlam speech is powerful and memorable because of its direct, down to earth appeal to its audience, as if he is speaking with equals, rather than down to them. “Whitlam [spoke] about all the things that he said that his government would want to do. And then at one point, part way through the speech, he sort of pauses and he says, ‘I need your help’,” Scalmer recently told the Seriously Social podcast. “He invites the participation, the enthusiasm, and of course the votes of those who are listening to him. So I think that idea that a speech is not a delivery of wisdom from on high, but rather is inviting a response or reciprocation from the audience, is enormously important to an effective political speech.” Whitlam, with whom humility was not necessarily synonymous, was socially and politically equalising himself with the audience with the repeated mention of his fellow citizens. He was inviting them to share the space and the ride. Albanese may not be a Whitlam-esque orator. But he sure knows Labor history. For the most part, in Australia at least, there are probably better and more memorable political speeches that were delivered outside of a campaign context. A few years ago, together with the playwright Katie Pollock, I co-wrote two plays – The Hansard Monologues – based entirely (don’t yawn) on Hansard. As someone who’d watched parliament professionally for many years, the dramatic and occasionally comic potential was no surprise. It was rich pickings. The challenge lay in what to omit (our first drafts were many tens of thousands of words!). What made a great parliamentary speech was entirely different to what made an effective election stump oratory, although they sometimes shared similar characteristics. That is, a willingness – or impulse – to speak beyond the confines of party politics, to demonstrate humanity, candour and raw natural emotion. Perhaps the top two speeches in the house in the parliaments covered by The Hansard Monologues are then prime minister Julia Gillard’s misogyny speech and then putative prime minister Malcolm Turnbull’s condolence speech for Robert Hughes. (Meanwhile, the most extraordinary speeches I heard from all corners of the parliament were delivered on 19 June 2000, when distressed MPs lamented the suicide of the Labor MP Greg Wilton. The emotion was palpable, the honesty raw, disarming – even distressing. One of the most moving one was delivered by Tony Abbott. The words were spoken with tears and brittle sentiment as members and senators decried the brutality of politics and called for a more human and caring politics. Incidentally, the very next day was one of the most viscerally ugly and partisan in recent memory!) Paul Keating’s Redfern speech, followed closely perhaps by his speech for the unknown soldier, were exemplars of a politician’s powerful oratory delivered away from an election and parliament. It seems authenticity – a trait that can desert a politician who is too tightly controlled or overly-cautious – is everything when it comes to political stump speeches. “I think you see that ... [with] leaders who are often … good communicators before they take on the highest office. I’m thinking of Julia Gillard and Malcolm Turnbull,” Sean Scalmer says. “When they weren’t prime minister … they were seen to be more authentic, more honest, more persuasive. And then immediately when they became prime minister they seemed to be stilted, controlled and all of the things that people react against.” He points out that until the late 19th century political “stumping” in Australia and Britain were often viewed as gauche and tasteless. Charles Gavan Duffy, a radical Irishman who became premier of colonial Victoria, started making stump speeches all over the state to shore up his position. “He’s accused of importing American methods. So, this method doesn’t help him to stay in power, but what it does is it encourages his treasurer, Graham Berry. And it’s Graham Berry, about four years later, who then begins to use the stump speech to try and build up a mass political party,” Scalmer says. “And all around Australia people are watching what Berry’s doing. And in other colonies, they say, ‘well, we have to adopt these methods too, even if we think they’re a bit distasteful’.”",Opinion/Opinion,"What makes a great political speech?

5/19/2022,"As we herald this new age of record low unemployment, there is a little-known but long-term trend that ought to be injected into the public discourse. The fact the Australian Bureau of Statistics unemployment rate has dipped dramatically in the past few months, and will potentially fall below 4% on Thursday, has been welcomed by the Coalition, Labor and economists as a good thing. But what of the plight of those still locked out of the jobs market? The little-known fact is this: according to the latest statistics published by the Department of Social Services, 40% of those on the jobseeker payment – that is, the primary unemployment benefit offered by Centrelink – are unable to work full-time. And it is not because they don’t want to. It’s primarily because, according to Centrelink, they live with an illness or disability that prevents them from doing so. This is a cohort of people that has grown astronomically over the past decade, but, despite the warnings of welfare advocates, has been all but ignored by governments amid the focus on the ABS’ headline unemployment rate. As years have gone by, the average person on jobseeker has changed markedly. Not all of these people are covered by the current 4% unemployment rate compiled by the Australian Bureau of Statistics at all times: some are temporarily not looking for work because of a condition, caring responsibilities or their age. They come in and out of job searching. Others are working some hours each week, though their income is still low enough that they need welfare payments to supplement their earnings. And some people considered unemployed by the ABS don’t collect unemployment benefits at all, either because they’ve chosen not to claim them or because they’re ineligible. With unemployment at a record low, a narrative has emerged in some quarters that with many businesses desperate for workers, those who are not finding work must be choosing to be unemployed. In fact, massive changes to the welfare system (essentially making it harder to get the right payment), as well as the chronically ineffective employment services system (recently overhauled once again) – as well as age and disability discrimination – are the real story. Alex Paine, 22, lives with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in the Melbourne suburb of Clayton. Paine’s condition means she could not do many jobs, though she is required to look for work to keep getting the jobseeker payment, currently set well below the poverty line at a base rate of $46 a day. The few jobs that have been suitable have not fallen her way. “There’s a very, very limited amount of jobs that are suitable for me, because I have a lot of issues with my legs and my leg joints,” she says. “I can’t stand for long periods of time, I can’t sit for long periods of time. “So honestly, most of the jobs that I have to apply for to meet the quota are things that I just simply could not do.” Paine has been rejected from the disability pension and is classified by Centrelink as “partial capacity to work”, meaning a person with a physical, intellectual or psychiatric impairment that prevents them working at least 30 hours a week. In December 2021, the number of jobseeker payment recipients with partial work capacity was 374,647, or 40% of the 937,638 people who were on the payment in December. The growth in this cohort of individuals over the past few decades has been shocking. The same figure was less than 10%, as the Parliamentary Budget Office noted in a report released in 2020, and 25% by 2014. The same report found that in general the trend is as follows: people on unemployment benefits are increasingly female (in part due to increased workforce participation), increasingly older (due to changes to the pension age and other changes), and increasingly sick or living with a disability (due to a crackdown on the disability support pension. The report also found people are spending longer on jobseeker payments. In fact, while the average number of weeks on unemployment benefits was 113 weeks in 2014, it is now 166 weeks or more than three years at last count in December 2021. Brisbane-based Peter Williams, 52, is also classified as “partial capacity for work”. He took a medical redundancy in 2017 but has been searching for work again since 2019, after being diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis (sometimes known as chronic fatigue syndrome). “I’ve applied for an awful lot of jobs,” he says. Williams has a background in call centre work and is applying for work in that field, as well as administration. “I can only work two to three shifts a week, a maximum of five hours per shift, and I need a full day off to recover between those shifts,” he says. “So you can understand the difficulty of trying to get a job with those limitations.” “There’s never been a better time to get a job, if you’re in certain categories,” he continues. “If you’re young, if you’re healthy … If you’ve got any barriers to employment, you’re pretty much shut down.” Given the unemployment rate is at near record lows, you might be forgiven for assuming that there are also fewer people on unemployment benefits. In fact, there were still 104,310 more people on the jobseeker payment in March 2022 compared to February 2020. Despite some suggestions in the media to the contrary, the respected academics Prof Peter Whiteford of ANU and Prof Bruce Bradbury of UNSW say this does not mean there are more people on benefits who do not want to work than before. Far from it. In fact, the December 2021 data shows that 20% of all those on jobseeker payment were in fact already working, but were not earning enough to lose their benefits. “The unemployment rate paints a rosy picture, but the reality is there are 100,000 more people on jobseeker now than before the pandemic when the unemployment rate was much higher – 5.1%,” says Kristin O’Connell, a spokesperson for the Antipoverty Centre. “It ignores the complex circumstances that are keeping so many people out of work and trapped on a payment that is about half the poverty line.” Paine, who is currently readying a new disability support pension, agrees. “I just wish that people understood that this is not a choice,” she says.",News/Australia news,"In an age of low unemployment in Australia, what about those locked out of the jobs market?",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/19/in-an-age-of-low-unemployment-in-australia-what-about-those-locked-out-of-the-jobs-market
5/19/2022,"Fifa should pay reparations of at least $440m (£356m) to migrant workers whose human rights have been compromised by the Qatar World Cup, a group of non-governmental organisations has said. England and Gareth Southgate have been asked to support the initiative, described as an “innovative scheme” that would “provide some real redress” for workers, as attempts to leave a positive legacy for the tournament come into focus six months before the opening World Cup fixture in Doha. Amnesty International, alongside Human Rights Watch, Football Supporters Europe and the trade union the Building and Wood Workers’ International are among those calling for a remediation scheme that would address the documented failings of human rights protections which have scarred the history of Qatar’s World Cup. According to the organisations, Fifa should “reserve an amount not less than the $440m prize money offered to teams participating in the World Cup, to be invested in funds to support remediation. This would represent just a small percentage of Fifa’s anticipated $6bn revenues from the tournament and the $1.6bn it holds in reserves. “This amount reflects a likely ‘floor’ for the scale of harm suffered. The final amount required for remedy will be determined by the scale of the need, the harms to be redressed and reparation measures to be offered, should be decided through a participatory process and subject to an independent evaluation.” Sacha Deshmukh, the CEO of Amnesty International UK, called on England to support the idea. “We hope the FA and Gareth Southgate and the players will back this innovative scheme,” he said. “International football can easily afford to do the right thing here. This is a comparatively small share of Fifa’s enormous prize money pot – and it would provide some real redress for the serious human rights violations that underpin this tournament.” Fifa, in response, said it was “assessing” the proposals. It said it had put in place “an unprecedented due diligence process” in relation to the protection of workers and – alongside the Qatari Supreme Committee responsible for tournament – had devised its own remediation processes.

5/19/2022,"Hospital admissions for people with eating disorders in England have risen 84% in the last five years, official NHS figures reveal. There were 11,049 more admissions for illnesses such as bulimia and anorexia in 2020-21 than in 2015-16, with 24,268 admissions in total. Experts described the increase as “alarming”. The number of children and young people admitted to hospital with eating disorders grew from 3,541 to 6,713, with a 35% increase in the last year alone as the Covid pandemic hit, according to the analysis by the Royal College of Psychiatrists. A particularly stark rise in admissions – 128% – was seen in boys and young men, from 280 hospital admissions in 2015-16 to 637 in 2020-2021. The college has published guidelines to help health professionals identify people whose eating disorders have become life-threatening and get them the right care. It said the signs that somebody was dangerously ill could be missed at GP surgeries and in A&E due to a lack of guidance and training. Even when seriously unwell, people with eating disorders can appear to be healthy, with normal blood tests, the college said. For example, somebody with anorexia can have dangerously low levels of electrolytes such as potassium that are not reflected in blood tests. Patients with bulimia can also have severe electrolyte disturbances and stomach problems but can be a normal weight or overweight. Dr Dasha Nicholls, who chaired the development of the medical emergencies in eating disorders guidelines, said: “Eating disorders such as anorexia, bulimia and binge eating don’t discriminate, and can affect people of any age and gender. “They are mental health disorders, not a ‘lifestyle choice’, and we shouldn’t underestimate how serious they are. Even though anorexia nervosa is often referred to as the deadliest mental health condition, most deaths are preventable with early treatment and support. Full recovery is possible if spotted and treated early.” She said there was a need to raise awareness of common eating disorder symptoms. “Our guidance encourages healthcare professionals to spot when someone is dangerously ill, and dispel the myths surrounding them,” she said. “They remain poorly understood, with devastating consequences for thousands of patients and their families. “If we are to stop the eating disorders epidemic in its tracks, it is vital that this guidance reaches healthcare professionals urgently and that government backs them with the necessary resources to implement them.” One in five deaths of people with anorexia are due to suicide, while there are high rates of self-harm and depression with all eating disorders. James Downs, 32, who developed anorexia at the age of 15, had to wait more than six years after being diagnosed to receive specialist support. He blamed a lack of awareness of the signs of eating disorders getting worse among non-specialist healthcare professionals. In the six years it took to get support, his illness took hold and his physical health deteriorated. Downs was frequently admitted to hospital with low potassium levels, low blood sugar, heart abnormalities and other consequences of malnutrition. “Getting help early could prevent so many people from being admitted to hospital,” he said. “All healthcare professionals should be able to spot the signs and have timely and accessible treatments to offer patients.”  In the UK, Beat can be contacted on 0808-801-0677.

Data collected by Cancer Research UK (CRUK) shows that 71% of people will be overweight by 2040, a rise from 64% today. Of these, almost 36% of adults – 21 million people – will be obese. The charity described the figures as “staggering”. “These projections should serve as a wake-up call to the government about the state of our nation’s health,” said Michelle Mitchell, the chief executive of CRUK. “Ministers mustn’t keep kicking the can down the road when it comes to tackling the obesity crisis – delaying measures that will lead to healthier food options.” Last week, the government announced it was delaying measures to tackle unhealthy eating for 12 months. The former Conservative party leader William Hague said the weakening of the anti-obesity strategy was “morally reprehensible”. The U-turn will mean a ban on buy-one-get-one-free deals for foods high in fat, salt and sugar will be postponed for 12 months. A ban on TV junk food adverts before a 9pm watershed has also been put on hold for a year. “I urge them to revisit this decision and take bold action on obesity, the second biggest preventable risk factor for cancer in the UK,” said Mitchell. Being overweight or obese increases the risk of at least 13 different types of cancer and also causes other conditions such as high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes. In the UK, an estimated 22,800 cases of cancer are attributed to obesity every year. The CRUK report suggests the number of people who are obese could overtake the number who are a healthy weight as early as the late 2020s in England and late 2030s in Northern Ireland. For Scotland and Wales, the crossover is not expected to happen before 2040. Prevalence of severe obesity (a body mass index above 40) is expected to almost double across the UK from 3% to 6%. About 60% of women are currently overweight or obese but this is projected to rise to 67% by 2040. Among men, 74% will be overweight or obese by 2040, up from 68% now. The report also suggests those experiencing higher levels of deprivation could suffer the most. In 2019, 35% of people living in the most deprived areas of England were obese. This is predicted to increase to 46% by 2040. In comparison, 22% of people living in the least deprived areas were obese in 2019, with a predicted rise to 25% by 2040. Dr Julie Sharp, the head of health and patient information at CRUK, said: “Obesity is a complex issue and the world around us can make it very difficult to keep a healthy weight. “Government action is key in making sure that the healthy option is readily available and affordable for people and addressing the wider barriers that prevent people from living healthy lives. If these staggering trends continue, obesity will eclipse smoking as the biggest cause of cancer.”",News/Society,More than 42m UK adults ‘will be overweight by 2040’,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/19/more-than-42m-uk-adults-will-be-overweight-by-2040
5/19/2022,"A rare stone circle has been found at a prehistoric ritual site in Cornwall, with seven regularly spaced pits mapped by a team of archaeologists. Bracken and scrub were cleared over the winter at Castilly Henge near Bodmin to allow archaeologists to survey the site. They found the pits lying in a crooked horseshoe formation. Experts believe the pits may once have formed a complete ring but ground conditions at the time of the survey left archaeologists unable to gather clear data on the northern part of the henge interior. Some stones had been removed and taken elsewhere, while others were probably pushed face down into the pits in which they once stood upright. Castilly Henge is believed to have been built during the late Neolithic period, about 3,000–2,500BC. Defined by an external bank and an internal ditch, the henge formed an amphitheatre-style setting for gatherings and ritual activities. Not all henges contain a stone circle, and there is only one other in Cornwall – Stripple stones on the slopes of Hawk’s Tor on Bodmin Moor. Archaeologists believe henge sites would have been used for gatherings and rituals. Research at Castilly Henge began in 2021 when it was included in a scheme by Historic England to conserve and repair monuments on its at-risk register. Volunteers led by the Cornwall Archaeology Unit cleared the site of vegetation that was threatening features of the site hidden below ground. This enabled teams from Historic England to carry out the first detailed topographic and geophysical surveys of Castilly Henge. Peter Dudley, a senior archaeologist at Cornwall Archaeological Unit, said the management of the “amazing archaeological site” has been improved with re-fencing. “Now the monument is looking so much better.” Ann Preston-Jones, a project officer for at-risk heritage sites with Historic England, said: “The research at Castilly Henge has given us a deeper understanding of the complexity of this site and its importance to Cornish history over thousands of years. It will help us make decisions about the way the monument is managed and presented, so that it can be enjoyed by generations to come.” There is evidence to suggest Castilly Henge was used as a theatre in the middle ages and a gun emplacement during the English civil war.",News/UK news,Rare stone circle found at prehistoric ritual site in Cornwall,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/19/rare-stone-circle-found-castilly-henge-prehistoric-ritual-site-cornwall
5/19/2022,"Ken Bruce has retained his title as the most listened-to radio presenter in the UK, as the Radio 2 host continues the trend of mid-morning programmes attracting more listeners than breakfast shows. The pre-lunchtime 10am slot was traditionally seen as a radio backwater, as mocked by Steve Coogan’s Alan Partridge presenting a show called Mid Morning Matters. By contrast, the breakfast show tended to be the biggest show on any station’s lineup, with people tuning in as they got ready for work, headed to school or drove their car. Years of changing listening habits, exacerbated by the pandemic, have now upended the status quo on many stations, according to the latest Rajar listening figures, which cover the first three months of 2022. Bruce attracted 8.4 million listeners a week, beating the 7.4 million people who tuned in to Zoë Ball’s breakfast show. Other mid-morning shows that are reaching more people than their station’s breakfast programmes include those of LBC’s James O’Brien, TimesRadio’s Matt Chorley and Classic FM’s Alexander Armstrong, according to analysis by the audio consultancy Hallett Arendt. The pattern is not universal – Radio 4’s Today programme continues to outperform the rest of the station’s output with 6.5 million listeners a week, while Heart’s Jamie Theakston and Amanda Holden host the biggest commercial breakfast show in the UK with 3.9 million listeners. But it does suggest a wider shift in listening habits that is forcing radio schedulers to reconsider when they deploy their biggest names. BBC 6 Music also celebrated its 20th year on air by attracting a record audience of 2.8 million listeners. There is further evidence that smart speakers – such as Amazon’s Alexa – are increasingly replacing standalone radio sets in people’s houses. The devices, which only took off in popularity in the last few years, already account for about 10% of all radio listening in the UK. They pose a challenge for established radio stations as listeners are prompted to choose a station every time they turn on, rather than leaving a radio constantly tuned to the same outlet. Elsewhere, the continuing boom in speech radio and political debate has benefited Rupert Murdoch’s TimesRadio, which grew its audience by 40% to 703,000 listeners a week. TalkRadio, its culture war-loving sister radio station, also hit a record audience figure of 650,000 listeners – causing much delight among some of the station’s staff, who said they have grown the audience over several years while producing shows on a tight budget. They compared the station’s high listening figures to the poor viewing figures of the channel’s talkTV offshoot, the big-budget television show fronted by Piers Morgan. Both speech outlets remain far behind LBC, owned by the media company Global, which has a national audience of 3.5 million listeners a week and continues to attract listeners with its opinionated hosts. The rightwing current affairs television channel GB News has also begun broadcasting its audio feed as a national radio station. It managed to attract 239,000 people a week.",Arts/Television & radio,Ken Bruce remains most popular UK radio host as mid-morning trend prevails,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/19/ken-bruce-remains-most-popular-uk-radio-host-as-mid-morning-trend-prevails
5/19/2022,"Glory comes in many forms and it came for Kevin Trapp in the form of an astonishing save in the final minute of extra time. When Kemar Roofe’s cross was deflected into the path of Ryan Kent six yards out, a late winner seemed certain. But Trapp scuttled across his goal, spread himself and the ball cannoned away off his outstretched right leg, a block rooted in hour upon hour on the training ground, honing reflexes and response times, getting the angles right. He had four years at Paris Saint-Germain, but that save, even more than keeping out Aaron Ramsey’s penalty in the shootout, is what will define his career. In his second spell at Frankfurt, he became the man who won them their second European trophy. A balmy night in southern Spain, a tight stadium with two steeply banked tiers, two enormously passionate fanbases, and it was possible to believe all is right with football. That it went to extra time, that weary players, hair drenched with sweat, were forced to drag aching limbs through more gruelling minutes, felt entirely appropriate. It may even be right that the final 10 minutes of the 90 seemed to consist entirely of Rangers taking throw-ins on their left flank. The flares, the smoke, the small posse of riot police in surprisingly shiny helmets. This is what these nights are supposed to look like and this, after all, is what these events are supposed to be about: a great sense of occasion for two teams for whom European success feels not a birthright but an almost impossible quest. There have been plenty of Europa League finals that have felt as though they were mere consolation at the end of a disappointing season, but not here. For Rangers, the second-best team in Scotland, and Eintracht Frankfurt, the 11th-best team in Germany, this was an occasion beyond all expectation. These are campaigns that will be talked about for decades to come: the goals, the drama, the inconvenient journeys. And if the stadium at the end of it felt a little old-fashioned, the aisles tight, the signage inadequate, the toilets and bars almost overwhelmed, that was part of the charm. When Celtic reached the Uefa Cup final in Seville in 2003, they played at the miserable open bowl of the Olimpico a little way out of town. The Sánchez Pizjuán, with its famous tiled facade, is far more romantic than that: even the drunkest fan, as many proved, could just about manage the stagger there from the bars just north of the Alcázar. It was noisy and it was fervent. Rarely can quite so many fans have been dressed in team colours: the Frankfurt end almost entirely white, the Rangers end blue speckled with the occasional orange, some sections a mix of the two. A reported 5,500 police had been designated to the game, but most of them must have been deployed outside the stadium. Inside such segregation as existed was enforced by thin lines of yellow-tabarded stewards. Given anxieties before the game that seemed a risk but, within the stadium at least, everything passed off peacefully. There had been talk of 150,000 fans descending on Seville, but the numbers fell significantly short of that mark; the Frankfurt supporters who remained in Germany themselves created an astonishing atmosphere watching on a big screen in the Deutsche Bank Park. Fears of violence, though, were not exaggerated. Although for much of the day fans mixed happily enough, there were clashes at the west end of the bridge where Calle Enramadilla crosses Avenida San Francisco Javier, prompted, it appeared, by a group of perhaps 200 Frankfurt fans attacking Rangers ones seated outside bars. Punches and kicks were exchanged, there was a lot of posturing and some plastic furniture was thrown. The previous night, five Germans had been arrested after flares were hurled at Rangers fans. The game, in truth, rather struggled to live up to the atmosphere but even that gave it a pleasingly retro feel. The old European finals tended to be about anxiety and grind rather than overt brilliance. But they were about glory just the same. When Joe Aribo had left Charlton for Rangers in 2019, their manager Lee Bowyer had told him he was making a big mistake. But when Tuta’s slip left him clean through against Trapp 12 minutes into the second half, the possibility suddenly opened up that he could be the hero, that he could be the man to give Rangers their first European trophy in 50 years. And however cynical modern football may be, even that opportunity is surely worth a lot. Aribo took his chance, rather more cleanly than might have been expected from somebody who hadn’t scored in 18 previous European ties this season, but there were further twists to come. Ibrox immortality was dangled before him and then snatched away by Rafael Borré’s equaliser. But glory was seeking a host, and it found one in the form of Trapp. Ten years ago, he had been sent off after 19 minutes of his debut for the club. It has been a long wait, but on a night that evoked European finals of old, his transition to hero was complete.",Sport/Football,Kevin Trapp’s career-defining save lights up final for Euro nostalgists | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/18/kevin-trapp-career-defining-save-lights-up-europa-league-final-nostalgists-rangers-eintracht-frankfurt
5/19/2022,"Injured women are experiencing sex discrimination in the administration of a life-saving drug that cuts the risk of bleeding to death by 30%, researchers have warned. They found that female trauma victims were half as likely to receive tranexamic acid (TXA) as injured men – even though the treatment is equally effective regardless of sex. “These results are very concerning. TXA is the only proven life-saving treatment for traumatic bleeding. Women were treated less frequently than men regardless of their risk of death from bleeding or the severity of their injuries,” said Prof Ian Roberts of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), who was involved in the study. “This looks like sex discrimination, and there is an urgent need to reduce this disparity, so all patients who need the drug have the chance to receive it.” TXA helps blood to clot, and is used to prevent excessive bleeding in various situations, including where there is known or suspected severe bleeding after an injury. It is also given following certain types of head injury. To investigate whether the drug is equally effective in men and women, Tim Nutbeam at the University of Plymouth and colleagues reanalysed data from two large trials which showed that giving TXA within three hours of traumatic injury reduces the risk of death. They found that the drug reduces the risk of death by up to 30%, regardless of sex. Next, they examined data from 216,000 patients included on the Trauma Audit Research Network (Tarn) database, which collects information from major trauma units in England and Wales, to see if injured men and women were treated differently. “Whatever of the mechanism of injury, and whatever the bleeding risk we looked at, women were statistically less likely to receive tranexamic acid than men, apart from road traffic collisions with a very high risk of bleeding,” said Nutbeam, whose research was published in the British Journal of Anaesthesia. “However, when we looked at mechanisms of injury which we tend to associate less with major trauma, such as falls from standing, women and particularly older women were much less likely to receive it.” As striking as these results are, they are not necessarily surprising, he added: “It is already known that women with chest pain are less likely to receive aspirin, less likely to be resuscitated for out of hospital cardiac arrest, and less likely to be taken to hospital by an ambulance using lights and sirens.” Explaining why these differences in TXA administration exist requires further research. “We can only speculate,” Nutbeam said. “I think very little of it is doctors or paramedics saying: ‘I don’t like women, and therefore I’m not going to give them this drug.” One issue may be the training that doctors and paramedics have received. “Traditionally we are taught that trauma is about young men in car accidents, or doing something silly after consuming drugs or alcohol, but the reality is that it affects every spectrum of society, and it disproportionately affects older patients,” said Nutbeam. “Clinicians in the UK must be provided with clearer treatment guidance so that we can help reduce this bias.”",News/Society,"Injured women face discrimination over life-saving drugs, say researchers",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/18/injured-women-discrimination-life-saving-drugs-researchers
5/19/2022,"Rafael Santos Borré stood alone in front of a sea of blue. All that, a long hot night in Seville and an even longer wait stretching back half a century, and it came to this: one shot to clinch Eintracht Frankfurt’s first European trophy in 42 years. The Colombian, who had scored in the quarter-final, semi-final and again in the final to bring them to this penalty shootout, ran up and scored again. The ball flew beyond Allan McGregor, history made. At the other end of the Sánchez Pizjuán, Eintracht’s fans went wild, an extraordinary, unexpected run completed. Rangers’ fans, meanwhile, fell silent for the first time, although those that stayed would stand to applaud players who had given everything and were now broken, a unique opportunity snatched from them. Fifty years they had waited for a European trophy; who knows how much longer they will have to wait for another chance. They had led for just over 10 minutes, only to see Borré equalise. Then a glorious 118th-minute chance for Ryan Kent would have won it only for Kevin Trapp to make an extraordinary save from close range, the follow-up from Steven Davis somehow deflecting over the bar. That meant this final went to penalties. It was a scenario they had practised for and Aaron Ramsey had been sent on precisely to take one, but he watched Trapp save again, a crazy 19-game ride finally over in the cruellest way. So close, but defeated at the last. It had been tense at times, and it had been some occasion too. The city was packed, the Pizjuán loud. And the game was lively at times too. Certainly when these two sides, built for the break, were able to get up and running. Eintracht especially, at least to start with, Daichi Kamada taking a touch too many when the first opportunity dropped, eventually stopped by McGregor, and Djibril Sow’s unable to put away the follow up. Ansgar Knauff, JesLindstrom and Sow all had shots too, at a time when the battle for the wing announced between James Tavernier and Filip Kostic was being won by the Serb, a muscular, dynamic and very direct presence. A recurring one, too. He struck a clever shot onto the roof of the net from 20 yards and then went flying up the pitch from one area to the other only to pull wide on half an hour. Eintracht’s shot count was in double figures now; Rangers had taken just that one, although with Scott Wright getting more of the ball, John Lundstram’s header was tipped over by Trapp. And Gio van Bronckhorst’s team took the lead too, a simple Connor Goldson header returning a goal kick did the damage. Sow misjudged it, diverting the ball towards his own goal. Tuta slipped and suddenly Joe Aribo was away, running at supporters who erupted when he slotted the ball beyond Trapp. For a moment, Eintracht seemed to find it hard to comprehend what had happened, but they knew they had to take a step forward; they also knew Rangers were more likely to take a step back. A superb recovery from Calvin Bassey prevented Knauff from getting away. Then Kamada, alone in the area, lifted his shot over McGregor and on to the roof of the net, fists beating at the turf in frustration. But Eintracht did level when Kostic’s cross passed by four men in blue, Goldson the last one to see it go, just as Borré nipped in front of him at the near post to turn it into the net. Eintracht pressed, McGregor pushing away and Kostic flashing just wide, but it was Rangers who almost avoided extra time when Glen Kamara’s 95th-minute attempt was blocked. On it went, Scott Arfield, the sub, hitting over. Bassey would then have gifted Eintracht a wonderful chance but for the fact that few recover like he does and so, having missed the ball and twisted himself into knots, he unravelled again and chased down Borré inside the area. He then matched Knauff, forcing his opponent into a hurried shot. The legs were heavy, the efforts tired but not spared, even if the fear of defeat weighed as heavy as the determination to win and the errors were accumulating, shots often taken too early. Davis had one blocked and then Borna Barisic stung Trapp’s palms, beyond 105 minutes now. Ajdin Hrustic pulled wide. Kristijan Jakic swung over the bar, head turned to to the sky. Thoughts turned to the shootout, substitutions made with that in mind. And as those final seconds ticked away, an astonishing save by Trapp, denying Kent from just five yards out, ensured they got there, giving him another chance to be a hero, history made for Eintracht at Rangers’ expense.",Sport/Football,Rangers suffer Europa League final shootout defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/18/eintracht-frankfurt-rangers-europa-league-final-match-report
5/19/2022,"Thomas Tuchel has opened up on Andreas Christensen withdrawing from Chelsea’s FA Cup final defeat by Liverpool on the morning of the game, claiming it was not the first time the defender had pulled out of a match at short notice. Christensen, who is set to join Barcelona this summer, forced Tuchel into a late rethink for the final when he made himself unavailable despite not being injured. The Denmark centre-back was in line to start but he has complained of stomach issues before games in the past and it is unclear whether he will be involved when Chelsea host Leicester on Thursday and Watford on Sunday. “Andreas came in the morning of the match to inform me, speak to me,” Tuchel said. “He told me he was not ready to play the match, to start the match and be on the bench. He had his reasons. They stay private and confidential. It was not the first time as you can see over the last weeks that we had some of the same situations. “That’s why he did not play regularly over the last weeks. We thought we are in a good progression, development because he played a strong match before the final against Leeds. The conversation took place. We had to respect it. Of course. He has our support still but for tomorrow I am unsure. It was very short notice before the Cup final, not only before this match. Other matches the weeks before. No chance I have a prediction before tomorrow or the weekend.” It remains to be seen whether Christensen is given a send-off at Stamford Bridge. The 26-year-old is out of contract at the end of the season and agreed to join Barcelona after negotiations with Chelsea over a new deal broke down. Tuchel, who is also losing Antonio Rüdiger to Real Madrid, said that he wanted César Azpilicueta to stay at Chelsea. Barcelona are targeting Azpilicueta, who has triggered a one-year extension in his contract, and Chelsea could let their captain leave. “We had a lot of these talks because very genuinely it felt like he won everything after the Club World Cup,” Tuchel said. “Given his personal situation I can understand maybe a cycle is at its end. Then it’s a change of ownership, so it maybe increased his thoughts about his situation. “But then his extension kicked in and he loves the club. We are still in a dialogue and we are also selfish – we are not responsible to solve any other club’s problems. Given we already lose key defenders, it’s not ideal to think about losing Azpi. At some point if you are a legend you deserve maybe also from me and the club a second look at it.” Tuchel said he needed Azpilicueta’s leadership but he acknowledged that he must see whether the Spaniard is committed to the club after 10 years. “He is everything that Chelsea is about,” the German said. “But there are more layers to consider. If he cannot get rid of this feeling … we find out if he can give all that makes him special. “With all respect he can only be special if he is committed 100% and does not have one concern in his head that he should have done something differently.” Tuchel added that Chelsea, who cannot sell or buy players until their takeover is complete, faced a big task to strengthen their defence. They want to sign two centre-backs and are expected to revive their interest in Sevilla’s Jules Koundé after Todd Boehly’s consortium has bought the club from Roman Abramovich.",Sport/Football,‘Not the first time’: Tuchel on late Christensen pullout from Chelsea team,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/18/thomas-tuchel-late-andreas-christensen-withdrawal-chelsea-fa-cup-final-not-first-time

Musk’s tweet comes as the Tesla CEO shocked markets this week by announcing his $44bn deal to purchase Twitter was on hold as he awaited further data on fake and spam accounts on the social media platform. Analysts have speculated the Tesla executive is seeking to back out of his Twitter takeover plans, or buy the company at a lower price. His tweets since – including that he was buying the platform to “own the libs” – have attracted further controversy. On Wednesday, Musk warned that political attacks against him would “escalate” in the coming months and said he will no longer support Democrats because they were the party of “division” and “hate”. Musk, who says he is politically “moderate”, made a similar claim earlier this week, stating that he had long backed Democrats, but would now vote for Republicans.

He has also said he will reinstate Donald Trump, whom Twitter permanently banned after finding his tweets were “highly likely to encourage and inspire people to replicate the criminal acts” that took place in the January 6 Capitol attack. The billionaire’s tweets have rocked Twitter’s share price and fueled speculation about his motivations. This week he sent a poop emoji in response to Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal’s tweets about spam. Musk suggested earlier this week that he could seek a lower price for the company because of the fake accounts. “It really depends on a lot of factors here,” he said. “I’m still waiting for some sort of logical explanation for the number of sort of fake or spam accounts on Twitter. And Twitter is refusing to tell us. This seems like a strange thing.” Musk’s agreement to buy Twitter is legally binding, and he could face a $1bn break fee for walking away. “Twitter is committed to completing the transaction on the agreed price and terms as promptly as practicable,” the company said in a statement on Tuesday.",News/Technology,Elon Musk plans to ‘vote Republican’ and warns of political attacks on him,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/18/elon-musk-republican-political-attacks
5/19/2022,"Whenever a comedy based around women’s sexual adventures and misadventures arrives, I always settle down before it with one question: will it pass the mons pubis test? That is: does it have a single scene, moment, plot point or anything else that approaches the story of my friend, who was in bed with a man who was proving lacklustre – but unexpectedly asked her if she’d like oral sex. Pleasantly surprised, she said yes. He promptly bent down, kissed her on the MP – “Like you would the cheek of an elderly relative” is a description that stays with me – patted her on the flank, rolled over and went to sleep. Except for Pulling and Fleabag, the answer is rarely yes. The latest addition to the genre, Spreadsheet, an Australian import on Channel 4, but starring England’s own Katherine Parkinson (The IT Crowd, Humans, Hang Ups), alas does nothing to redress the balance. Parkinson plays Lauren, a slightly chaotic divorced lawyer and mother of two trying to carve out some time between her domestic and professional commitments for as much no-commitment sex as she can find. To this end, she and her assistant Alex (Rowan Witt) have compiled the eponymous spreadsheet, replete with columns for potential peen, salient characteristics of the men attached to them, times and dates of – uh – dates, plus post-shag notes and scores. To anticipate the traditional objection: you’re right, it wouldn’t be acceptable if the sexes were reversed. Why? You know why. Stop being disingenuous and forcing us to have the conversation about context, history, structural sexism and oppression and all the well rehearsed rest of it. Just kick back and enjoy your general privilege, ’K? Thank you! Blessings upon you! So. It is the kind of comedy where (actual) oral sex in a car park is referred to as “dining alfresco”. It is the kind of comedy in which the lead is a tech moron so sexy messages and pictures are accidentally sent to friends and colleagues instead of hook-ups. It is the kind of comedy where some online inamoratos turn out to have been using extremely flattering profile pics. It is the kind of comedy in which all of her supposed one night stands are keen to meet up again, and one of them turns out to be the PE teacher at her children’s school. “We might need to be a little more specific in the workplace column,” she tells Alex. Parkinson is as good as ever, within the limits of the material. And there are occasional touches that rise above the basics. Although the presence of an obtuse secretary in these things is de rigueur, Katrina Milosevic is so good as Ange, ever-admiring of her boss’s bravery (“All those apps. Competing with girls half your age and they’ve all got … the face”) that she’s almost worth the price of admission alone. A date with a man with suspected hyperspermia (opinion is divided as to whether his dating profile photo – which showcases many centilitres of unspeakableness – is the product of one or many deposits) is a new one on me. And Lauren’s family relationships – with her children (exceptionally good and genuinely charming turns from youngsters Maila Latukefu and Harper Nichols, which give such a lift to the family scenes), her sister-in-law and her ex-husband – are rather sweetly and sensitively drawn. Despite a handful of good lines in each episode, most of the script is slightly laboured (“A black and white [profile] picture can make a loaf of gluten-free bread look mysterious,” says Alex). And, overall, the feeling you’re left with is one of faint boredom, edging into depression. Is this really the best we can do where women and sex are concerned in the year of our lord 2022? Is a mother/professional/slightly older woman hoping to get her end away without emotional investment still a valid enough premise to get behind? It feels at this point as if we’re all just still pretending that it is. Sex without commitment has been a real thing for long enough now that making it the complicating factor of a sitcom requires a collective act of disbelief before the action even begins.

5/19/2022,"This garlanded production of Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe’s musical, fresh from Broadway, is the definition of a comforting night out at the theatre. It glides from one well-loved song to the next on an elegantly twirling set designed by Michael Yeargan. Amara Okereke, as Eliza Doolittle, has a voice that fills the auditorium. It is a thrill to see Vanessa Redgrave as Henry Higgins’s mother – even if she is gone in the blink of an eye. Higgins (Harry Hadden-Paton) himself is a foppish mashup of several Very English Types, from Colin Firth to Doctor Who – slightly bumbling and not nearly as patrician or haughty as Rex Harrison in the 1964 film. But for those who have seen that screen classic, it is hard to list the reasons to come out for this faithful revival rather than stay at home with the movie. Under Bartlett Sher’s direction, the lack of invention feels like a missed opportunity. It is thoroughly preserved in aspic – a time capsule of reassuringly good music, nice dresses and lots of insults towards women of a low social order – Eliza is a “cabbage-leaf” and “baggage” to be walloped if she is naughty. There are no knowing winks, twists or clever allusions to the here and now, except for one weak joke about Englishness and a tweaked final scene that left me puzzled and unconvinced. Lerner and Loewe’s musical take on George Bernard Shaw’s Pygmalion looks and feels much like a comforting Christmas show. At times, it begins to resemble pantomime in its over-acting and most certainly in Redgrave’s immense Ascot hat in the race day scene. It is solidly performed all round but characterless and sedate. Funny moments – the turning point in Eliza’s elocution lessons and the disdain of her dustbin man father (Stephen K Amos) for his new middle-class life – never really catch fire. Okereke’s Eliza has an exaggerated comedy walk: elbows pushed out, shrugged shoulders, stomps and squeals. We never see the softer, more vulnerable side to her character. Hadden-Paton, who starred in the original 2018 show in New York, brings a boyish charm to his part as the arrogant linguistics expert who scrapes a flower-seller off the streets of London so that he can transform her into a duchess. His derisory comments on women and the working-classes sound desperately antiquated – what would he make of the Urban Dictionary? And would his committed bachelorhood in I’m An Ordinary Man render him an incel today? But his point on regional accents as a classifier of social standing in Britain remains depressingly relevant in the assumptions we still make. The chemistry between Higgins and Eliza never kicks in and there is no real hint of an awkward romance between them, even after Eliza has sung I Could Have Danced All Night. They are better at playing mutual animosity, although there is growly shouting rather than anything more subtle. It is easy to see why this show was such a hit on Broadway, with its exportable vision of a bygone Britain filled with top hats, period lamp-posts and oak-panelled rooms. Could it be that this Disneyfied Englishness is simply built to win the hearts, and wallets, of West End tourists or is that too cynical?

5/19/2022,"Frank Lampard has said Crystal Palace’s visit to Goodison Park could be pivotal to shaping Everton’s future as his team attempt to secure their Premier League status. Everton would avoid a first relegation since 1951 with a win against Patrick Vieira’s team on Thursday. Anything less, however, and their fight to avoid the drop will go to the final day at Arsenal. Lampard denied Palace represented an “all-or-nothing” game, on the basis his side could get something at Arsenal, but admitted: “Historically it could be a big night for us because we know the situation.” The manager said: “I’m certainly not overplaying the idea of a relegation battle as if that is something to get excited about. It is just that, with the situation we are in, it is absolutely pivotal to the future of the club in the short term to get the results we need to stay in the league. Also football is about moments and about the opportunity for the players, the staff and the fans to come together and share a moment that means a lot to the club. And we shouldn’t understate that. “It won’t be cause for huge celebrations if we get the right result but at the same time everyone is fighting in the same direction for something, so we have understand what a big night that could be for the club.” Everton have missed two opportunities to reach safety, drawing at relegated Watford and losing at home to Brentford on Sunday when they had Jarrad Branthwaite and Salomón Rondón sent off. That has intensified the pressure on their final home game of an arduous campaign but Lampard believes his squad have the mentality to cope after they responded in similar circumstances to beat Manchester United and Chelsea at Goodison recently. “You have to approach every game differently in terms of the opponents,” he said. “Against Chelsea there was an expectancy to have only 30% possession and we had to defend very well and accept their passing and style. Man United was different, Palace will be different. We understand their threats. “There’s probably more onus on us against Palace to show more attacking intent and probably have a bit more possession and be higher up the pitch. So it is different in that sense but in terms of the attitude, yes, we want the same attitude as we approached Man United, Chelsea, Leicester, even Liverpool and Man City because we approached them with absolutely the right attitude. “It is really obvious what is at stake in this game, and the last two games, and the size of this game can’t be lost on anyone.”",Sport/Football,"Everton survival could hinge on Crystal Palace result, says Frank Lampard",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/18/everton-survival-could-hinge-on-crystal-palace-result-says-frank-lampard
5/19/2022,"The City watchdog will be handed powers to ensure local communities across the UK have access to cash and could ultimately fine banks that fail to comply. Under the government’s pending financial services bill, the Financial Conduct Authority will be in charge of making sure the UK’s largest banking and building societies give consumers access to withdrawal and deposit facilities such as ATMs within a “reasonable” distance from their community. The Guardian understands the FCA could dole out fines if lenders fail to maintain those facilities in line with the legislation, though what counts as a reasonable distance has not yet been confirmed. The rules will also stop short of protecting bank branches, and will more likely mean that banks provide access to free-to-use ATMs, Post Offices or mobile banking hubs. News came as Lloyds Banking Group – which also owns the Halifax and Bank of Scotland brands – confirmed plans to close a further 28 branches, leaving the group with 1,387 sites across the UK. About 5,000 bank and building society branches have disappeared from UK high streets since 2015, resulting in a near halving of the UK’s branch network, according to the Which? consumer group. The government’s announcement on the FCA was welcomed by campaigners who have long warned that the UK’s dwindling cash facilities are putting elderly and vulnerable people, who struggle to maintain bank accounts online, at risk. Access to cash has also become more important during banking outages, which can block card transactions and online bank transfers. About 5.4 million adults use and rely on cash on a daily basis, the Treasury said. Natalie Ceeney, chair of the Access to Cash Review and Cash Action Group, said she was pleased to see the government acting quickly after the Queen’s speech last week. “We need to see the consultation response in full to have a better understanding on how the legislation will work in practice,” she said. “What’s important is that a lot of work has gone into this over the past few years and I am pleased that parties of all colours recognise the importance of access to cash. It is vital that we all work together to get the best outcome for consumers and small businesses.”",Lifestyle/Money,City watchdog to ensure banks provide access to cash across UK,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/may/18/city-watchdog-to-ensure-banks-provide-access-to-cash-across-uk
5/19/2022,"The final series of Derry Girls (Channel 4) has been a triumph. Rather than resting on its laurels, it pushed itself to new heights. From its celebrity cameos – classy, sparing, and in the last ever episode, it’s fair to say surprising – to its playful decision to mix up genres, each week has been delightful. I loved the episode set almost entirely on a train, the “haunted” house trip, and the school reunion flashback to Sarah and Mary’s youth, movingly dedicated to “all the mammies”, which was so good that fans have been calling for a spinoff series. It is a rare comedy that bows out on a high like this, but Derry Girls has been bold in its victory lap. It has earned its right, then, to say a protracted farewell with not one but two episodes. The first is a classic caper, fittingly doing what the show does best by getting the gang of five into a scrape then letting them make it far worse for themselves. Fatboy Slim, or Slimboy Fat, depending who you ask, is playing in Derry on Halloween, and the girls (and I do include the wee English fella in this, as is only right and fair) will simply die if they don’t get tickets. The trouble is that a local hardman stands in the way of them and their Rockafeller Skanks. It’s the ultimate in 90s nostalgia, from its soundtrack to the Claire Danes in Romeo and Juliet idolisation to queueing at a record shop to pick up tickets made out of paper. James has to fight for the girls’ honour, which goes as well as you’d think, while Michelle gets stuck in as only she knows how: by lying through her teeth. Even Clare is finally free to be her wee lesbian self. (To its credit, Derry Girls has tried to make a virtue out of Nicola Coughlan’s clear lack of availability for filming, owing to a Bridgerton clash; almost every episode has involved a guessing game as to how Clare might not make it to whatever mess they’ve got themselves caught up in.) As well as brilliant buffoonery, Derry Girls has found a new-ish emotional maturity, and I admit to getting choked up on more than one occasion. It pulls at the heartstrings but avoids being too cheesy, so when it goes for the big dramatic moments, it almost always lands them. Episode six builds to one of those moments, but it could not have been the way they planned to end it. For a comedy so good at silliness – just watch what Orla is doing at any given moment, even when she’s not speaking – it would have been too sad to leave it like that. Thankfully, the hour-long final episode, set one year later in 1998, wraps it all up with a perfect proportion of light and shade. It is Orla and Erin’s joint 18th birthday party, and the Good Friday agreement referendum is taking place. There are huge lessons to be learned about compromise, and difficult decisions in all areas of life. Orla, for example, wants a monkey-themed party, while Erin wants it to be literary greats. “Find a middle ground, girls,” says Aunt Sarah. “Like, literary monkeys.” The middle ground proves elusive, on many levels. The budget for Erin and Orla’s party does not quite match their expectations, and the history-making referendum is stealing their thunder. This does not downplay the magnitude of the shifting political landscape (and what better time to be reminded of it) but plays it out as it affects ordinary people’s lives, which is smart and touching. Michelle and Erin row about which way they are going to vote, and it pitches into drama again, refusing to shy away from grave topics. But it always comes back to the comedy. You’d think it might be difficult to make a debate about paramilitary prisoners into a joke, but the pieces just fit together. And if there is a funnier scene on TV this year than Jenny’s commemorative Choose Hope play, put on for the school assembly to Sister Michael’s utter despair, I would be very surprised. It took a while for Derry Girls to establish itself as that rare thing, a modern comedy classic, but now it feels like it has always been there. There’s a strong sense that though it will be missed, it hasn’t outstayed its welcome. Instead, it has been absolutely cracker.",Arts/Television & radio,Derry Girls finale review – absolutely cracker ,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/18/derry-girls-finale-review-absolutely-cracker
5/19/2022,"Good morning. Aged care Covid deaths soar in Australia, Muslim Australians abandon Labor in key marginals and the US pledges Nato cooperation with Finland and Sweden. Covid deaths inside aged care facilities are occurring at rates unseen during the first two years of the pandemic, as government data reveals at least 60 people are dying a week, with more than 350 deaths since the start of the election campaign. Aged care works are preparing to strike tomorrow, citing frustration about low pay, heightened workforce pressures and workload. Scott Morrison has described every death as a “terrible loss” but explained that the high number of deaths is due to people dying “with Covid” but not necessarily “because of Covid”. Anthony Albanese flagged a new national strategy to reduce the deaths if Labor wins the election. Virologists, meanwhile, have accused both Labor and the Liberals of failing to address slowing booster uptake rates amid a creeping “complacency” in pandemic planning. As the federal election enter its final few days, Guardian Australia looks back at what we learned from visiting marginal electorates across the country. While one voter in a Tasmanian marginal seat described the two would-be prime ministers as “two cheeks, same arsehole”, Guardian staff have identified seven key policy areas in which the main parties diverge. In western Sydney, Muslim Australians have expressed frustration at Labor taking “our community for granted for so many years”, with a younger generation of Muslim voters considering alternatives. And, in case you were wondering, the child Scott Morrison knocked over on the soccer field in Devonport last night is fine. The US will work with Finland and Sweden in the event of a “threat of aggression” as the two nations edge closer to Nato membership. President Joe Biden said the US would maintain its “robust exercise activity and presence” in the Baltic Sea region, and counter “any threats to our shared security”. In Ukraine the treatment of nearly 1,000 soldiers from Mariupol’s besieged Azovstal steel plant is unclear, with the Kremlin confirming they’ve been sent to a prison colony in a Russian-controlled area of the Donetsk region. A Russian soldier has pleaded guilty to shooting an unarmed civilian during the first war crimes trial in Kyiv. More than 10,000 cases have been registered over the past few months. The number of Australians turning to crowdfunding to secure their accommodation has quadrupled in the past year in the face of dramatic rent increases and low vacancy rates in major cities across the country. The rate of tropical rainforest die-off has doubled since the 1980s, with research suggesting global heating could see forests releasing more carbon dioxide than they absorb. Burnout is driving an increasing number of healthcare staff out of hospitals in regional NSW, with policy failure at state and federal level “forcing many GPs to close up shop”. The EU is planning to commit €210bn over five years to end its reliance on Russian oil and gas, announcing a major increase in solar and wind power and a target of 45% renewables by 2030. Sudanese refugees fleeing massacres will be forcibly returned to Rwanda by the UK Home Office, with asylum seekers being issued “notices of intent” under a controversial new policy. Cryptocurrency crashes will not reduce the sector’s environmental footprint, Dutch researchers have suggested, with energy-intensive rates of “mining” remaining steady, despite nearly $1tn being wiped off the sector in the past month. “It was 2010 and DVD sales in Australia were booming.” Olivia Bennett and her mum had stumbled across an absolute bargain: five VHS cassettes for 50c at Lifeline; and after multiple trips they were well on their way to a thousand-strong collection of their favourite films – from Jim Henson’s Labyrinth to Pete’s Dragon. Michael Sun talks to several “collectors” and finds that there’s “something about a physical medium – the tactility of it … There’s just something innately comforting about that.” When Australians go to the polls this Saturday, their real wages will be about the same rate as they were when Tony Abbott took office in 2013. As Greg Jericho explains: “It really does put all talk about a strong recovery from the pandemic into context. Yes, GDP has recovered, and yes unemployment has fallen, but the ability of workers to buy things with their wages has fallen.” Geraldine Quinn bought her family’s first dial-up modem so it’s safe to say she was in on the ground floor when it comes to online giggles. And as our guest curator for this week’s 10 funniest things on the internet she’s delivering Alex Jones as you’ve never seen him before. The case for a federal anti-corruption commission: It’s a broken promise that has dogged the Morrison government, while Anthony Albanese says he’ll have one in place before 2022 is out, if Labor wins office. On this episode of Full Story, chief political correspondent Sarah Martin explains why the watchdog is needed.

Queen and Adam Lambert will open the BBC’s Platinum Party at the Palace concert with a special performance marking the actual Queen’s 70 years on the throne. May stole the show with his surprise rooftop appearance for the golden jubilee concert in June 2002. He said: “Twenty years after playing the Queen’s glorious golden jubilee, we’re very happy to be invited again. Then there was a moment when I wondered … after Buckingham Palace roof, where can you go? Well … you will see.” Alicia Keys, Nile Rodgers and Andrea Bocelli will also perform during the three-stage, two-and-a-half-hour event on Saturday 4 June. The lineup will also include Duran Duran, the Bond composer Hans Zimmer, Ella Eyre, Craig David, Mabel, Elbow and George Ezra. Ryder, who came second at the Eurovision contest in Italy on Saturday with the song Space Man, the UK’s best result in 24 years, will also perform live. Sir Elton John will appear in a pre-recorded performance. Soul legend Diana Ross, who has not performed in the UK for 15 years, will close the event with a live performance. She said: “I have had the honour of meeting the Queen many times throughout my life, including when I was with my family. “Her Majesty has and continues to be such an incredible inspiration to so many across the world and I was absolutely delighted to receive an invitation to perform on such a momentous and historic occasion.” The evening will feature appearances from sports figures and stars of the stage and screen, including Sir David Attenborough, Dame Julie Andrews, Stephen Fry, the tennis player Emma Raducanu, the former footballer David Beckham, the Paralympian swimmer Ellie Simmonds and the Royal Ballet. The dance troupe and Britain’s Got Talent winners Diversity will also perform. The evening would highlight global themes that had emerged or evolved during the Queen’s reign, organisers said, and would include British and Commonwealth contributions in the fields of fashion, sport, the environment, pop music and musicals. The latter section will be curated by Andrew Lloyd Webber and include a special appearance by the Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, plus performances featuring the casts of The Phantom of the Opera, Hamilton, Six, The Lion King and Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.

5/19/2022,"The wild ride on the US stock markets continued on Wednesday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average sinking more than 1,100 points as investors worried about a looming recession. All of the major US markets fell sharply, with the S&P closing down 4%, its largest fall since June 2020, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq losing 4.7%. On Tuesday markets had rallied following positive news about consumer spending and signs that China was relaxing its strict Covid-19 lockdowns. Just a day later concerns about an economic slowdown triggered a wide-ranging sell-off. The sell-off began after Target said supply chain costs and inflationary pressures had cut into its profits and customers were buying fewer higher-margin items such as kitchen appliances, televisions and furniture. The retailer’s announcement came a day after Walmart said its profit had also been hit by higher costs. The latest news from Target led to a sell-off for retailers including Amazon, BestBuy, Costco and Dollar General. Investors are increasingly concerned that rising inflation, and the Federal Reserve’s plans to tackle it by sharply hiking interest rates, will trigger a recession. Target’s management expects inflation to add $1bn to its fuel and freight costs this year and sees little sign of those costs easing throughout 2022. Gas prices topped $4 a gallon in every state this week for the first time. “Throughout the quarter, we faced unexpectedly high costs, driven by a number of factors, resulting in profitability that came in well below our expectations, and well below where we expect to operate over time,” said Target’s chief executive, Brian Cornell. The sell-off was broad-based. Tech companies including Apple, Meta and Tesla fell sharply, as did the makers of household goods and grocery stores including Kroger and Procter & Gamble. General Motors and American Airlines fell along with banks including JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs. Stocks have been struggling to pull out of a slump over the last six weeks as concerns pile up for investors. Trading has been choppy on a daily basis and any data on retailers and consumers is being closely monitored by investors as they try to determine the impact from inflation and whether it will prompt a slowdown in spending. A bigger than expected hit to spending could signal more sluggish economic growth ahead. The Fed is trying to temper the impact from the highest inflation in four decades by raising interest rates. On Tuesday, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, told a Wall Street Journal conference that the US central bank will “have to consider moving more aggressively” if inflation fails to ease after earlier rate hikes. Investors are also concerned about global growth as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine puts even more pressure on prices for oil and food while lockdowns in China to stem Covid-19 cases worsens supply chain problems. The United Nations is significantly lowering its forecast for global economic growth this year from 4% to 3.1%. The downgrade is broad-based, which includes the world’s largest economies such as the US, China and the EU.

5/19/2022,"A landmark bill to legalise voluntary assisted dying in New South Wales remains on track to pass through the state’s upper house, after a marathon debate which lasted until midnight on Wednesday night and will resume on Thursday. The legislation is set to reach a final vote in the upper house this week, after members debated 92 late amendments for 12 hours on Wednesday. . The approval of some amendments means the bill will now need to return to the lower house – six months after it passed there despite the opposition of both the premier, Dominic Perrottet, and Labor leader, Chris Minns – before it can become law. Although the bill enjoys a clear majority in the upper house – including support from all six Nationals MPs – opponents staged a prolonged filibuster, moving dozens of amendments in an attempt to slow the bill’s passage. Many of those had been heard during the debate in the lower house last year, including an amendment which would prevent healthcare workers from raising the option of voluntary assisted dying with patients. That amendment, as with dozens of others, was defeated. Two technical amendments put forward by the education minister, Sarah Mitchell, were approved, as well as one moved by the Nationals and one from Labor MP Greg Donnelly, who proposed more than 30 amendments. The changes mean the bill will have to return to the parliament’s lower house before it becomes law. Mitchell said she intended to vote in favour of the bill. “It’s important that members have the chance to raise any amendments that they may have,” she said. “But I would certainly like to see that bill completed this week.” The bill, introduced by the independent MP Alex Greenwich with 28 co-sponsors, limits access to voluntary assisted dying to people with terminal illnesses who will die within six months, or 12 months in the case of a person with a neurodegenerative condition experiencing unbearable suffering. The person must be found to have capacity to make the decision to go ahead voluntarily without duress, and the application would be assessed by two medical practitioners. Donnelly also proposed an amendment that would allow religious residential aged care facilities to ban residents from accessing voluntary assisted dying. He suggested it would allow terminally ill patients to move to facilities that did not oppose voluntary assisted dying but the amendments were defeated. The minister for regional health, Bronnie Taylor, spoke to oppose that amendment, saying the bill went far enough to appease the rights of aged care institutions. “People in aged care, in any form of residential care and in hospitals, must retain the right to make choices about their life, their life and their options,” Taylor said. “Why would we support a law aimed at substituting their decisions over their life with those of distanced boards and directors?” Taylor, who previously worked as a clinical nurse specialising in palliative care, said she spoke with experience. “I absolutely respect a person’s choice. This is about choice.” The numbers in the lower house mean the bill will almost certainly pass into law following the upper house debate. It would make NSW the final state in the commonwealth to pass voluntary assisted dying legislation. Victoria passed what the premier, Daniel Andrews, described as the most conservative euthanasia regime in the world when it passed in 2017. ​​Kiki Paul, the chief executive of Go Gentle Australia, an advocacy group supporting the laws, said the NSW bill’s progress had been “exceedingly slow”. “But we have been buoyed by the resounding defeat of the first two sets of opponents’ amendments – which augurs well for the final vote,” she said. Opponents of the bill characterised the changes as an attempt to provide additional safeguards. “I am an opponent of the bill, but I believe that we need to deal with the reality that is before us, which is that the voluntary assisted dying bill will pass this parliament,” the Liberal Party MP Scott Farlow said. “That is not something that I will celebrate but it is reality. In passing the bill, I think that we need to have as many protections in place as possible.” - Australian Associated Press contributed to this report",News/Society,Midnight sitting of NSW upper house fails to resolve debate over assisted dying bill,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/19/midnight-sitting-of-nsw-upper-house-fails-to-resolve-debate-over-assisted-dying-bill
5/19/2022,"Martin Shkreli, the “Pharma Bro” entrepreneur who astronomically increased the price of a life-saving drug by 5,000%, and became a symbol of corporate Wall Street greed, has been released from prison. In a statement released on Wednesday, the Federal Bureau of Prisons said he had been released to a halfway house. “We can confirm Martin Shkreli transferred on May 18, 2022, from the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) Allenwood Low to community confinement overseen by the Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) New York Residential Reentry Management (RRM) Office,” the statement said. Shkreli’s lawyer Benjamin Brafman confirmed his release, saying: “I am pleased to report that Martin Shkreli has been released from Allenwood prison and transferred to a BOP halfway house after completing all programs that allowed for his prison sentence to be shortened.” Shkreli is expected to be released from community confinement on 14 September 2022. He was originally due to be released from prison in September 2023. In a Facebook post on Wednesday, Shkreli posted a selfie of him in a car wearing a grey sweater and black glasses with the caption: “Getting out of real prison is easier than getting out of Twitter prison.” Earlier this year, the 39-year old was barred for life from the pharmaceutical industry and fined $64.6m by a US court after the Federal Trade Commission and seven states brought a case against him. Shkreli had previously been the chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals, a company that hiked the price of Daraprim, a life-saving drug used to treat Aids, malaria and cancer by over 5,000% in 2015. After his company acquired the Daraprim, it raised the price from $13.50 a tablet to $750 a tablet, prompting national outcry. In 2018, Shkreli was sentenced to seven years in prison after being found guilty of two counts of securities fraud and one count of securities fraud conspiracy. In addition to being banned for life from serving in any capacity in the pharmaceutical industry, Shkreli has also been permanently barred from running a public company.",News/US news,‘Pharma Bro’ Martin Shkreli released from prison early,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/18/martin-shkreli-release-prison-early
5/19/2022,"The White House is braced for a North Korean missile or nuclear test while Joe Biden is on a trip to South Korea and Japan, which begins on Thursday. The national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told reporters on Wednesday: “Our intelligence does reflect the genuine possibility that there will be either a further missile test, including long-range missile test, or a nuclear test, or frankly both in the days leading into, on or after the president’s trip to the region. “We are preparing for all contingencies, including the possibility that such a provocation would occur while we are in Korea or in Japan,” Sullivan added. Biden’s trip is intended in part to signal that he has not forgotten about US strategic interests in the Indo-Pacific despite the focus since February on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “The message we’re trying to send on this trip is a message of an affirmative vision of what the world can look like, if the democracies and open societies of the world stand together to shape the rules of the road, to define the security architecture of the region to reinforce strong, powerful historic alliances,” Sullivan said. Biden is due to leave for South Korea on Thursday for talks with the country’s new president, Yoon Suk-yeol. According to the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, he will not be visiting the demilitarised zone between the two Koreas. The president is then expected to travel to Japan on Sunday for a summit of the Quad, comprising US, Japan, Australia and India. US and South Korean intelligence have been briefing for some days that it is possible North Korea could conduct a nuclear test, which would be its first in five years. In March, the Pyongyang regime carried out its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in four years, and has performed three other missile tests since then. CNN cited unnamed officials on Wednesday as saying new missile launch preparations had been observed at a launch site under satellite surveillance near Pyongyang. Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia nonproliferation programme at the Middlebury Institute for International Studies, said there had been general indications of impending nuclear or missile tests, including activity at North Korea’s nuclear test site. He pointed out Kim Jong-un recently talked about the need to “simultaneously push ahead with the material and technological preparations to cope with the future threats and challenges in an all-round way”. “This might mean either a nuclear or a missile test,” Lewis said, but added: “I suspect that North Korea’s schedule has more to do with their own political concerns and technical factors than Biden’s trip.”",News/World news,White House braced for North Korean nuclear test during Biden’s Asia trip,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/18/north-korea-white-house-nuclear-biden

5/19/2022,"Afghan armed forces collapsed last year because they had been made dependent on US support that was abruptly withdrawn in the face of a Taliban offensive, according to a scathing assessment by a US government watchdog. A report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (Sigar) on the catastrophic defeat that led to the fall of Kabul on 15 August, blamed the administrations of Donald Trump and Joe Biden as well as the Afghan government of Ashraf Ghani. “Sigar found that the single most important factor in the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces’ (ANDSF) collapse in August 2021 was the decision by two US presidents to withdraw US military and contractors from Afghanistan, while Afghan forces remained unable to sustain themselves,” said the congressionally mandated report, which was released on Wednesday. The Sigar account focused on the impact of two critical events that it said doomed the Afghan forces: the February 2020 Doha agreement between the Trump administration and the Taliban, and then Biden’s April 2021 decision to pull out all US troops by September, without leaving a residual force. “Due to the ANDSF’s dependency on US military forces, these events destroyed ANDSF morale,” the inspector general said. “The ANDSF had long relied on the US military’s presence to protect against large-scale ANDSF losses, and Afghan troops saw the United States as a means of holding their government accountable for paying their salaries. The US-Taliban agreement made it clear that this was no longer the case, resulting in a sense of abandonment within the ANDSF and the Afghan population.” The ANDSF were dependent on US troops and contractors because that was how the forces were developed, the report argued, noting “the United States designed the ANDSF as a mirror image of US forces”. “The United States created a combined arms military structure that required a high degree of professional military sophistication and leadership,” it said. “The United States also created a non-commissioned officer corps which had no foundation in Afghanistan military history.” It would have taken decades to build a modern, cohesive and self-reliant force, the Sigar document argued. The Afghan air force, the main military advantage the government had over the Taliban, had not been projected to be self-sufficient until 2030 at the earliest. Within weeks of Biden’s withdrawal announcement, the contractors who maintained planes and helicopters left. As a result, there were not enough functioning aircraft to get weapons and supplies to Afghan forces around the country, leaving them without ammunition, food and water in the face of renewed Taliban attacks. The US had begun cutting off air support to the Afghan army after the Doha agreement was signed. Exacerbating its impact on morale was the fact that the deal had secret annexes, widely believed to stipulate the Taliban’s counter-terrorism commitments and restrictions on fighting for both the US and Taliban. They remain secret, apparently, even from an official enquiry. “Sigar was not able to obtain copies of these annexes, despite official requests made to the US Department of Defence and the US Department of State,” the report observes. The secrecy led to unintended consequences, the report said. “Taliban propaganda weaponised that vacuum against local commanders and elders by claiming the Taliban had a secret deal with the United States for certain districts or provinces to be surrendered to them,” it said. The Sigar report also blames the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, who changed ANDSF commanders during the Taliban offensive, appointing aged loyalists from the communist era, while marginalising well-trained ANDSF officers aligned with the US. It quotes one unnamed former Afghan government official as saying that after the Doha agreement, “President Ghani began to suspect that the United States wanted to remove him from power.” According to the former official and a former Afghan government Ghani was afraid of a military coup. He became a “paranoid president … afraid of his own countrymen” and particularly of US-trained Afghan officers. Ghani fled Afghanistan on the day Kabul fell.",News/World news,"US withdrawal triggered catastrophic defeat of Afghan forces, damning watchdog report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/18/afghanistan-us-withdrawal-defeat-watchdog-report-sigar
5/19/2022,"An extremely rare 18th-century Chinese vase bought by a surgeon in England for a few hundred pounds in the 1980s has sold at auction for almost £1.5m. The 60cm (2 ft) blue-glazed, silver and gilt vase, decorated with cranes and bats, was created for the court of the Qianlong Emperor in the 1700s. Bought by the owner’s late father for its looks, the vase sat in the kitchen of the family’s Midlands home, where it was spotted in the 1990s by antiques expert Mark Newstead during a social visit. Years later, Newstead identified the Chinese emperor Qianlong’s six-character seal mark on its base, and said the vase was likely displayed in the halls of the Qing palace in the mid-18th century. Berkshire-based auctioneers Dreweatts had estimated its value at between £100,000-£150,000, but on Wednesday the piece fetched £1.2m, with a buyer’s premium bringing the total closer to £1.5m. It was reportedly sold to an international buyer via telephone. Newstead, who is a specialist consultant in Asian ceramic art at Dreweatts, said: “I was at the house with my wife for lunch in the 1990s. I was surprised to see the vase in the kitchen and said, ‘I think that’s something rather good,’ but didn’t pick it up or inspect it, as that wouldn’t have been appropriate. “The surgeon bought it just as a decorative thing. We do not have a receipt, but the daughter is reasonably certain he bought it sometime between 1988 and 1993. We are delighted with the result. It shows the demand for the finest porcelain produced in the world.” The vase, which has a crack in its neck, was described as “a testament to the creativity” of craftspeople working during the Qianlong period, who used enamelling techniques to cater to the emperor’s taste in exotic styles. It would have required at least three firings in the kiln to achieve the different colours, including at over 1,200C for the cobalt blue.",Arts/Art and design,Rare Chinese vase kept in kitchen sells at auction for almost £1.5m,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/18/rare-chinese-vase-sells-at-newbury-auction-for-almost-15m
5/19/2022,"The lead singer of New Order has attacked “ludicrous” NHS waiting lists for mental health support, as he spoke out about his anguish at being unable to help his former bandmate Ian Curtis in the days before he took his own life 42 years ago. Speaking at a suicide prevention event in parliament, Bernard Sumner – who was a member of the post-punk band Joy Division, whose singer, Curtis, killed himself at home in Macclesfield on 18 May 1980 – described the suicide of a friend’s daughter who had been told she would have to wait 18 months for help. “You can’t go on a waiting list if you are thinking of killing yourself. It’s ludicrous,” Sumner said. “You can’t wait 18 months. You need help straight away.” There are 1.6 million people on NHS waiting lists for mental health services, with health leaders estimating a further 8 million cannot get specialist help because they are not considered sick enough to qualify. Sumner was speaking alongside the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, and a health minister, Gillian Keegan, at an event exploring how suicide rates could be cut. It was introduced by Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker of the House of Commons, who was close to tears when he talked about the suicide of his daughter. “We know there are massive waiting lists,” said Keegan, who also spoke about how she had lost a younger cousin to suicide. “I worry about it every day.” She said the government was working to train 27,000 more mental health professionals, and provide more mental health support in schools and suicide prevention policies that particularly target high-risk groups, including men aged 45 to 55, new mothers and people leaving the military. Suicide rates in England and Wales have remained stable in recent years at between 10 and 11 deaths per 100,000 people, based on deaths registered by coroners following inquests into unexpected deaths. In 2020, 5,224 suicides were recorded, three quarters of which were by males. The suicide rate is markedly lower now than it was in the early 1980s when Curtis died, when there were around 14 suicides for every 100,000 people. Sumner described how Curtis had stayed with him for a fortnight before he died in 1980. “I tried every night to talk him out of it,” Sumner said. “He agreed with me but he was on a mission. It was going to happen. I don’t know what more we could have done.” Only 23, Curtis was married with a young daughter, but his marriage was heading for divorce. He had depression and epilepsy and had made an earlier attempt to take his life. Sumner called for mental health professionals who are helping people at risk of suicide to start communicating with their families who may not know about the issues, in a challenge to current patient confidentiality rules. Keegan responded: “It isn’t easy because of the age of consent, and if someone doesn’t want you to be involved, but more family involvement will help in many cases.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

5/19/2022,"Academics and student leaders have told MPs of their frustration at the denial of and the lack of practical action to tackle the “ingrained institutional racism” experienced by black students and staff on university campuses. Nicola Rollock, a professor of social policy and race at King’s College London, said examples of racism within academia had been “trivialised beyond belief” by the media despite leading some of its victims to consider suicide. Rollock said: “We are not talking about a single, one-off, isolated incident but women and other colleagues across the sector have been subjected to, and continue to be subjected to, sets of systematic behaviours that undermine and exclude colleagues of colour over a period of time. “In other contexts that would be described as bullying. In other contexts it would described as abuse. But because the topic is one of racism it is relegated to the sidelines.” Rollock, an expert on the careers of black female professors, told MPs on the women and equalities committee of cases involving black academics’ treatment at the hands of their employers “that were so upsetting and so traumatic and so shocking that it led them to consider taking their own life”. She added: “So I want to be absolutely clear, when we are talking about everyday racism, we are not talking about the odd raising of an eyebrow or the odd slight. We are talking about systematic, ongoing undermining and patronising behaviour that comes under the banner of everyday racism.” Rollock’s comments were supported by David Richardson, the vice-chancellor of the University of East Anglia, who said it was clear that “ingrained institutional racism” was behind the differences in top grades awarded to white and black students. “My view is that we need to move on from that debate and actually progress with dismantling that institutional racism,” Richardson said. “It’s been 15 years or longer that there’s been a 20% degree-awarding gap at institutions, and in that time that awarding gap has not diminished. “I think we just have not taken the time to address these covert issues that are impacting students from black, Asian and minority backgrounds and leading to those degree awarding gaps.” Rollock said: “If we are to move forward in a meaningful way – and some colleagues may see this as controversial but I see it as necessary – then we will have to consider the levers that are going to actually encourage, or perhaps force, change. And we are not just dependent on goodwill, more reports or individual commitments.” The committee also questioned Larissa Kennedy, the national president of the National Union of Students (NUS), over the accusations of antisemitism that have dogged the organisation. Kennedy said the NUS had acted “incredibly swiftly” on complaints of antisemitism including those from the Union of Jewish Students. “We are looking forward to this inquiry and have opened ourselves up even more than was asked … because we believe that any change that we need to see has to be a commitment to real transformative change that reckons with the structural issues here,” Kennedy said. “As national president I do deeply regret that we are at this point but I also really welcome that we are able to kick off this work that is truly about transformative change.”",News/Education,"Black students frustrated at lack of action on university racism, MPs told",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/18/black-students-frustrated-lack-action-university-racism-mps-told
5/19/2022,"Conservative officials are coming under increasing pressure to remove the whip from an MP arrested over claims of rape and sexual assault, or ensure he does not come to Westminster, as it emerged one alleged offence is connected to someone under 18. The man in his 50s has been bailed after being arrested on Tuesday over a series of alleged offences spanning seven years from 2002. One accusation concerns alleged abuse of position of trust, under a law that forbids sexual activity with anyone under 18 by an adult who is in a role of trust or authority over them. The MP has not been suspended, lost the whip or been formally barred from the Commons. Chris Heaton-Harris, the Conservative chief whip, has asked him to stay away from the parliamentary estate. Labour and trade unions have called for further action, saying that in any other work context a staff member accused of such offences would be suspended, with Labour arguing that naming the MP was a necessary consequence. Tory whips are understood to be unwilling to take action to name the MP for fear of identifying the alleged victim or victims, who are granted anonymity in cases of sexual assault. But they have been assured by the MP that he will not come to parliament, and say they are confident he will comply. Police do not usually name people who have been arrested but not yet charged, while a series of privacy based court cases mean media organisations now also rarely do so. Boris Johnson’s press secretary rebuffed questions on Wednesday about the idea of proactively barring the MP from Westminster, adding that the prime minister only learned of the allegations on Tuesday, and was “shocked”. However, Keir Starmer’s spokesperson said it “doesn’t seem to be sustainable to argue” that the MP should not lose the whip, even if that meant naming them. “It’s a matter for the Conservative party what they do but our view is that given the nature of the allegations then the whip should be suspended and obviously at that point it would become public,” they said. The GMB and Prospect unions, which represent parliamentary staff, have warned that a voluntary bar on the MP is insufficient, noting that Imran Ahmad Khan, the now-departed Tory MP for Wakefield, attended Westminster during investigations which led to him being convicted for of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy. Last month, unions representing workers at Westminster urged the House of Commons procedure committee to hold an inquiry into whether all MPs under investigation over allegations of sexual harassment should be banned. Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA union that represents senior civil servants, said for most employers it would be a “no-brainer” for the person in question to be suspended. “If it was any employer, you’d say OK there’s an allegation here; it’s going to be investigated; does that raise issues in relation to my other staff, in terms of health and safety?” he said. “Does it raise issues around the confidentiality of the process? You’ve got to balance all of those things before you make a judgment.” He added: “In most cases, with an employer, if the police were involved in a situation such as this, it would cross the threshold, it would be a no-brainer.” MPs are not directly employed, either by their parties or the Commons authorities, however. In another intervention, one of the lay members of the Commons standards committee, which deals with complaints about MP, said the situation with the MP was “a calamity”. “It’s all very well to ask him to stay away, but what about the many constituency venues where that is not applicable?” Rita Dexter, a former deputy commissioner at the London fire brigade, said. “What consideration has been applied to those?” Until 2016, MPs who were arrested were automatically named by parliamentary authorities. After concerns about privacy issues, they are now consulted, and named only if there is a reason of “parliamentary privilege or constitutional significance”, on the basis that this brings their treatment into line with that of others.",News/UK news,Tory party under increasing pressure to suspend MP arrested over rape claims,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/18/accused-tory-mp-alleged-offences-include-one-relating-person-under-18
5/19/2022,"As a Conservative MP arrested on suspicion of rape is released on bail, we take a look at sexual misconduct allegations made against MPs and their outcomes. The Conservative MP for Wakefield, Imran Ahmad Khan, was found guilty in April of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy after plying him with gin at a party in 2008. Khan assaulted the boy in Staffordshire in January 2008, 11 years before he became an MP. He resigned as an MP two weeks after he was found guilty. The Conservative MP for Tiverton and Honiton in April admitted to watching porn on his phone in the House of Commons. Parish initially suggested he had opened the porn “in error” but subsequently admitted that while the first time he had watched porn in parliament was an accident, and he was in fact searching for tractors, the second occasion was deliberate. He announced his decision to resign as an MP. The Conservative party removed the whip from the MP for Somerton and Frome, who, the Sunday Times reported, is facing allegations from three women. Warburton, 56, was accused by one of the women of climbing into bed with her naked. She told the Sunday Times she repeatedly warned that she did not want to have sex with him, but alleged that he ground his body against her and groped her breasts. He is said to have denied any wrongdoing, and insisted he had “enormous amounts of defence, but unfortunately the way things work means that doesn’t come out first”. The Conservative MP for Delyn was allowed to rejoin the party despite an independent investigation finding that he sexually harassed a junior member of staff. Roberts was suspended for 12 weeks after the independent panel found he had made “significant” repeated and unwanted sexual advances towards a former member of staff and used “his position as his employer to place him under pressure to accede”. He had his membership to the party restored but continued to sit as an independent MP in parliament. In December 2021, in family proceedings a high court judge concluded that the former Conservative minister raped his wife when she was asleep and subjected her to coercive control. The judgment detailed alleged domestic abuse by Griffiths towards his wife, Kate, who is a serving Conservative MP, during their marriage. It also included pressing her into sex, physically assaulting and verbally abusing her, the judge found. Andrew Griffiths denied allegations and “adamantly denied” rape. He resigned from government as business minister in July 2018 after sending 2,000 sexually explicit messages to constituents. In November 2019 he stepped down as an MP. The MP for Dover was convicted and jailed in 2020 for sexually assaulting two women. He was found guilty of three charges, two in relation to a parliamentary worker in 2016 and one in relation to a woman at his family’s central London home in 2007. The sentencing judge described Elphicke as “a sexual predator who used … success and respectability as a cover”. During the trial, jurors heard that his first victim had suffered a “terrifying episode” when he assaulted her, then chased her round his home chanting “I’m a naughty Tory”. In July 2021, an employment tribunal ruled that the Labour MP for Hartlepool repeatedly sexually assaulted and harassed a parliamentary staff member before victimising her when she refused his advances. A central London employment tribunal found he marginalised her in parliament, changed her terms and conditions of employment and made her redundant when the staff member, known as Ms A, rejected his advances and declarations of love. Hill had resigned as a Labour MP in March 2021, resulting in a May byelection in Hartlepool and a victory for the Conservatives. In April 2018, the Labour MP for Barrow and Furness was suspended from the Labour party amid an investigation into claims he sent inappropriate text messages to a female former aide. Later that year, he quit the Labour party, saying in a resignation letter that the disciplinary case was politically motivated and rigged against him. He vehemently denied the allegations. His resignation meant the investigation was not concluded. He continued to serve as an independent and later joined the House of Lords as a crossbench life peer. Conservative Michael Fallon resigned as defence secretary in 2017, admitting that his behaviour towards women in the past had “fallen short”. Fallon apologised for making unwanted advances to the journalist Julia Hartley-Brewer, repeatedly placing his hand on her knee – although Hartley-Brewer herself insisted: “No one was remotely upset or distressed.” However, after his resignation, additional allegations were made against him. In September 2019, he announced he would not seek re-election at the 2019 general election. The Conservative MP for Preseli Pembrokeshire was referred to the party’s complaints procedure in 2017 after admitting he sent “sexual chatter” to a 19-year-old woman who hoped to work for him. He resigned as pensions secretary in 2016 after allegations that he had sent suggestive messages on WhatsApp to a woman in her 20s, whom he had met through his political role. Crabb apologised for the messages and a Conservative party investigating panel determined that his behaviour had been inappropriate, but did not constitute harassment. He remains an MP. The junior trade minister Mark Garnier was formally cleared of wrongdoing in 2017 for asking his former assistant to buy a sex toy and calling her “sugar tits”. Garnier did not deny the accusations about the events in 2010 made by his former assistant Caroline Edmondson, which prompted a one-month investigation by the Cabinet Office to see if he had breached the ministerial code. Damian Green was sacked as first secretary of state in 2017 after admitting he lied about the presence of pornographic images on his House of Commons computer. In his resignation letter, the Conservative MP for Ashford continued to maintain he did not “download or view” the pornography, but added that he “should have been clear in my press statements”. A Cabinet Office inquiry was unable to reach a definitive conclusion on separate allegations, made by the Tory activist Kate Maltby, that Green had behaved improperly towards her. Green continued to maintain he did not believe he did anything inappropriate. The Labour MP for Luton North left the party in January 2021 before an inquiry into sexual harassment allegations against him was concluded, meaning no findings were drawn. Hopkins was accused in 2017 of inappropriate physical contact and was suspended by the Labour party pending an investigation. He continued to sit as an independent until the general election last year, when he opted to stand down from the House of Commons after a 22-year career. The prominent Eurosceptic cited his wife’s health as the reason for standing down and has denied the allegations against him. In 2017, Clive Lewis, the Labour MP for Norwich South and former shadow business secretary, was cleared of allegations of sexual harassment after a party investigation. Lewis, the MP for Norwich South, was accused of grabbing a female Labour member’s bottom at a fringe event at the party’s conference in September.",News/UK news,List of sexual misconduct allegations made against MPs ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/18/list-of-sexual-misconduct-allegations-made-against-mps
5/19/2022,"With the benefit of hindsight, one can say that the stock market got wildly overexcited a year ago about the recovery prospects of consumer-facing companies. When the restrictions came off, went the thinking, punters would enjoy themselves and lockdown’s corporate losers would be transformed into winners. As happens often, an essentially sound idea was overdone. Shares in Mitchells & Butlers, the UK’s biggest pubs group, rallied from 120p in autumn 2020 all the way to 325p in spring 2021 in anticipation of good times ahead. Since then, they have fallen back to 211p. Rival Marston’s has followed a similar trajectory: from 40p to 100p and now back to 58p. The famed short-seller Jim Chanos was right when, at the height of last year’s bullishness, he diagnosed too much wishful thinking on the part of investors. “The worst thing that can happen to reopening stocks is that we reopen,” he said cutely. Real life is hard, especially when reopening is followed by soaring energy costs, higher food prices, wage inflation and a brutal cost of living squeeze. There is, though, a fair argument that investors, having overdosed on optimism, are now underestimating the ability of the likes of M&B and Marston’s – two well-run companies – to adapt to tough trading conditions. Both companies in their half-year reports on Wednesday flagged cost pressures as “a significant challenge for the industry”, as the M&B chief executive, Phil Urban, put it. His group puts cost inflation at 11.5% this year versus 2019 levels, and is assuming 6% for the next year. But both firms also seemed encouraged by current consumer behaviour. “Trading remains stable and we look forward to an uninterrupted summer,” said Marston’s boss, Andrew Andrea. It may just be the calm before the storm and there are limits to how far menus can be tweaked to mitigate the effects of food inflation. Meanwhile, energy prices – a huge variable in cost bases – can always get worse. Yet it is probably also true that pub companies, when their balance sheets are sound, remain defensive assets with “proven resilience in previous times of economic challenge”, as Andrea argued. The sight of inflation at 9% already doesn’t help, but it’s also possible that much of the current uncertainty is already priced in. Not for the first time in the great Elon Musk/Twitter saga, one can observe that life would be simpler if the scrap were conducted under UK takeover rules. At the outset, we would have been spared the Twitter board’s flirtation with a “poison pill” defence, a mechanism that would be deemed a “frustrating action” under the UK code and ruled offside. It is also safe to assume that Musk would now be told not to be silly if he tried to argue that a “material adverse change” has taken place because Twitter can’t offer cast-iron proof of the number of fake accounts on its platform. Back in 2001, WPP tried to escape its offer for the advertising group Tempus on the grounds that the 9/11 terrorist attacks were a material change. It was ordered by the Takeover Panel to go ahead anyway, the thinking being that the value of Tempus could be recovered over time. Similarly, the consortium bidders for Moss Bros were not allowed to pull their offer when the Covid pandemic arrived in 2020. The point is that the bar for a material change should be set high, otherwise chancers will try their luck. A bit of bother about bots shouldn’t get remotely near the threshold. Musk’s approach is shabby, as argued here on Tuesday. The US system is more legalistic and its regulators seem all over the place, and so it falls to Twitter’s board to try to force through the deal on the agreed terms. The fact that there’s even a debate, however, is absurd – at least to UK eyes. Under a sensible set-up, Musk would know he’s on the hook with no prospect of wriggling off. Amanda Blanc, the chief executive of Aviva, the target of shockingly sexist remarks at the insurer’s annual meeting last week, fairly wonders if the incident will provoke a rethink on how boards interact with shareholders in future. One hopes it does. Turn off the offenders’ microphone at the earliest moment, tell them to leave the meeting and ban them from next year’s event.

5/19/2022,"Salvation for golf’s purists, irked by the Saudi Arabian themes dominating their sport, may arrive in the form of a 28-year-old from Dallas. Should Jordan Spieth lift the Wanamaker Trophy on Sunday evening, a career grand slam complete, there will be an appealing narrative to at least momentarily offset incessant chatter about breakaway tours, human rights and golf’s persona non grata, Phil The Shill. Spieth arrived at Southern Hills in the kind of form that suggests this is his finest chance yet to add the US PGA Championship to the Masters, US Open and Open. He would become only the sixth man in history to win each of golf’s big four. It is to Spieth’s credit that he fully embraces another tilt at history-making. “Certainly at this point, having won the other three, it’s an elephant in the room for me,” Spieth said. “It’s a goal of mine. If you just told me I was going to win one tournament the rest of my life, I’d say I want to win this one, given where things are at. If you told me that before my career started I was going to win one tournament ever, I’d say the Masters because that was my favourite tournament growing up. “Things change, and this obviously has significant meaning. Long term, it would be really cool to say that you captured the four biggest golf tournaments in the world that are played in different parts of the world and different styles, too. So you feel like you kind of accomplished golf when you win a career grand slam. “I have come close a couple times. This hasn’t necessarily been my most successful major but I feel good heading into this week.” Spieth has won the RBC Heritage and finished second at the Byron Nelson since a surprise missed cut at the Masters. Augusta National proved a head-scratcher for the man himself. “Friday’s round, I shot 76 and I can’t tell you that I missed a shot,” he said. “It was bizarre. I just really didn’t feel like I did much wrong. I’ve had weeks like that before. You just hope that they’re not at the Masters.” By his own admission, the old Spieth would have sought technical change after playing just 36 holes in Georgia. His slump after winning the 2017 Open renders a subsequent return to the summit of golf all the more admirable. Spieth is back inside the world’s top 10, having been 92nd in early 2021. Spieth, Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy leap out as the tournament’s marquee grouping for the first two rounds here. The trio have just the 22 majors between them. “They’re both just great to play with,” said Spieth. “They’re quick. They’re positive. I think you’ve got to embrace it and have fun and recognise these are the kind of pairings I’ll get to tell my kid about some day: ‘I got to play with Tiger in a major.’ “Last year, you weren’t sure if that was ever going to happen again. I know it’s great for golf, but selfishly it’s pretty exciting to be able to play these events growing up with the guy that you idolised.” McIlroy’s form and mood look positive as he pursues a first major triumph since 2014. Jon Rahm’s touch around the greens should be a huge Southern Hills advantage. Shane Lowry has said he is “quietly confident” about his prospects of victory. Only 98 days sit between the final round of the Phoenix Open and the same point in this US PGA. If Scottie Scheffler prevails in Tulsa, he will have won five times in that window. “When I show up to tournaments, I don’t feel any different,” insisted the Masters champion. Searing temperatures, brisk winds and crossover holes mean pace of play will inevitably be an issue. It would be no shock, in fact, if the second round rumbles into early on Saturday even without weather delays. Southern Hills offers a stern physical test. As if to prove thoughts of Saudi are never far away, Richard Bland delivered a blunt response when asked whether he had second thoughts over competing in their $25m event in Hertfordshire next month.

5/19/2022,"Ministers have rejected a key recommendation from the Grenfell Tower public inquiry that all disabled tenants should be given a personal evacuation plan in the event of a fire, sparking anger from survivors and disability campaigners. Fifteen of the 37 disabled residents perished in the 2017 fire and Sir Martin Moore-Bick, the chairman of the inquiry, recommended in October 2019 that the “owner and manager of every high-rise residential building be required by law to prepare personal emergency evacuation plans [Peeps] for all residents whose ability to self-evacuate may be compromised (such as persons with reduced mobility or cognition)”. But the Home Office said it has decided it is not proportionate or practical to introduce the plan, citing problems such as the costs to landlords. It said good relations between disabled and non-disabled residents could be put at risk if the latter had to shoulder costs associated with the evacuation plans such as buying evacuation chairs, or modifying buildings. “The evidence base for Peeps is not sufficient to mandate their implementation in high-rise residential buildings at this stage,” it said, as it announced a new consultation on alternative proposals. In 2019 Boris Johnson told parliament: “Where Sir Martin recommends responsibility for fire safety to be taken on by central government, we will legislate accordingly.” Robert Jenrick, then the communities secretary, added: “As the prime minister said in his opening remarks, the government will accept all of the findings of the report and accept them in full.” Disability Rights UK said the government’s decision was “utterly reprehensible and shows that it does not consider our lives to have equal value with non-disabled people”. Fazilet Hadi, Disability Rights UK’s head of policy, said: “The recommendation that Peeps be put in place was made by the Grenfell Tower inquiry in October 2019, following evidence from fire safety experts. Almost 40% of the disabled residents living in the tower died in the fire, and it is highly likely that their lives could have been saved had Peeps been in place … the government’s decision is a dereliction of its duties under the law, and fails to uphold our human rights.” Grenfell United, which represents bereaved people and survivors, said the decision “has left us speechless. Outraged.” It said the Grenfell inquiry “concluded that the government must drop its reliance on stay put and provide personal evacuation plans for disabled residents”. “Today – three years on – the government has announced it will not implement this core recommendation,” it said in a statement. “They have decided that cutting costs is more important than the value of human life. We will not let this be brushed under the carpet.” The alternative being considered by ministers involves sharing the location of disabled residents with fire services. This would probably be limited to residential blocks with an evacuation, rather than a stay put, strategy in place – typically buildings considered more at fire risk. In these buildings, landlords would be required to ask residents to make themselves known if they feel they might need support to evacuate in the event of a fire. The Local Government Association, which represents councils, said it would be “completely unacceptable to have a situation where high-risk buildings in which residents who can do so are told to evacuate immediately if there is a fire, but disabled residents are left inside in the hope of rescue by the fire service”. “There needs to be an obligation on landlords to take reasonable steps to ensure the safety of disabled residents,” said Cllr Ian Stephens, the chair of the LGA fire services management committee.",News/UK news,Outrage as ministers reject post-Grenfell safety plans for disabled people,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/18/outrage-as-ministers-reject-post-grenfell-safety-plans-for-disabled-people
5/19/2022,"Kenneth Branagh’s depiction of Boris Johnson has been revealed in a clip from the upcoming drama series This England, which follows the prime minister’s tumultuous first months in Downing Street as he grapples with the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic. The series, formerly known as This Sceptred Isle, is co-written and directed by Michael Winterbottom and is due to air on Sky Atlantic later this year. “The drama takes us inside the halls of power as Johnson (Branagh) grapples with Covid-19, Brexit, and a controversial personal and political life,” Sky said. “The events in government are interwoven with stories from around the UK, from the experts and scientists racing against time to understand the virus; the doctors, nurses and care-home workers on the frontline working tirelessly and heroically to contain and overcome it; and ordinary people whose lives were thrown into turmoil.” The teaser, released on Wednesday, opens with a jubilant voiceover by Branagh, 61, as the prime minister, saying: “A new dawn is breaking, 2020 will be a year of prosperity.” #ThisEngland, based on Boris Johnson’s tumultuous first months as UK Prime Minister starring BAFTA and Academy Award-winner Kenneth Branagh. #UnmissableSky pic.twitter.com/h6rNkyvcjd The tone of the video shifts as Johnson’s concern for the pandemic appears to grow. “This Covid virus we need to keep an eye on,” he says. A montage of clips of No 10 follows as the pandemic escalates, with the voiceover: “500,000 deaths, that is a worst-case scenario”. An eerie soundtrack plays as the familiar rhetoric to “wash your hands” and “stay at home” plays alongside images of the prime minister hosting press conferences at Downing Street. The pressure on the prime minister appears to mount as Branagh’s Johnson says: “Isn’t it someone’s actual job to give me a heads-up?” The teaser closes with an image of the door of No 10 shutting and a radio announcer saying: “The United Kingdom has overtaken Italy to report the highest official death toll.” Ophelia Lovibond, known for her roles in the BBC sitcom W1A and the film Guardians of the Galaxy, will portray Carrie Symonds, who was to become the prime minister’s wife. Symonds gave birth to the couple’s first child in April 2020, shortly after Johnson was admitted to an intensive care unit with Covid. The Broadchurch star Andrew Buchan will portray the former health secretary Matt Hancock, who later resigned from his post after video was leaked showing him kissing his aide Gina Coladangelo in his ministerial office – in breach of his own Covid rules. The series will trace the impact of the pandemic on Britain and the response of scientists, nurses and doctors. It is based on first-hand evidence from people inside Downing Street, the Department of Health, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies , and from hospitals and care homes. Tim Shipman, chief political commentator of the Sunday Times, is a consultant on the series.

5/19/2022,"Republican candidates who questioned, denied and challenged the results of the 2020 presidential election won a string of consequential primaries in Pennsylvania and North Carolina this week, a testament to the enduring power of Donald Trump’s voter fraud myth, which continues to animate the hard-right movement he started. In a campaign season dominated by angst over the economy and frustration with leadership in Washington, several hard-right candidates successfully channeled conservative grassroots momentum, and are now in striking distance of positions that will have enormous influence over voting and elections administration in battleground states across the country. Democrats, meanwhile, who face a grim electoral outlook dampened by Joe Biden’s dismal approval ratings, chose to elevate candidates who more closely reflected the party’s base, with progressives on the verge of growing their ranks in Congress. Though not yet complete, the results from Tuesday’s highly anticipated election night delivered a composite portrait of a Republican party still in Trump’s thrall, even in races where his chosen candidate came up short. In Pennsylvania, Republicans nominated Doug Mastriano, a hard-right election denier who was a key figure in the efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election in his state. He attended and helped organize Trump’s “Save America” rally in Washington on January 6 that preceded the deadly insurrection at the US Capitol, and has been subpoenaed by the House panel investigating the assault. Mastriano’s victory sets up a high-stakes showdown with Josh Shapiro, the state’s Democratic attorney general. Should Mastriano prevail in November, he would be in charge of one of the most contested states in the country – one in which the governor appoints the secretary of state, who in turn oversees the election. During his campaign, Mastriano embraced elements of Christian nationalism, staking out controversial positions on issues such as abortion, LGBTQ rights and public health mandates. In one debate, he suggested he would oppose any exceptions to an abortion ban, including in cases involving rape or incest. Shapiro has cast himself as a defender of abortion rights, an issue that is expected to play a key role in governor’s races this fall should the supreme court strike down Roe v Wade, as is anticipated. In his victory speech Tuesday night, Mastriano lashed out at media outlets and commentators who referred to him as “extreme”. “They like to call people who stand on the constitution far-right and extreme,” he said. “Forcing your kids to mask up, that’s extreme. Forcing healthcare workers to lose their job for not getting a jab. It’s extreme when you shut down businesses in our state.” In the marquee Senate race, the Trump-backed celebrity physician, Mehmet Oz, was neck-and-neck with the former hedge fund chief executive David McCormick, with nearly all of the vote tallied. The conservative commentator Kathy Barnette had fallen far behind and was out of contention for the nomination. During the campaign, the candidates competed to claim the Maga mantle. Both Oz, who touted Trump’s endorsement, and McCormick, who is married to the former Trump administration official Dina Powell, struggled to animate the former president’s loyal base, and spent millions of dollars of their personal war chests attacking each other in one of the most expensive intra-party brawls of the cycle. That apparently left an opening for Barnette, who enjoyed a last-minute surge in the polls. Despite her Maga bona fides and endorsements from Trump’s allies, the former president warned voters that she was unelectable. In response to doubts about the strength of her candidacy, Barnette said: “Maga does not belong to President Trump.” In North Carolina, the scandal-plagued first-term congressman Madison Cawthorn lost his re-election bid despite Trump urging supporters to give the 26-year-old Maga firebrand a “second chance”. He was beaten by Chuck Edwards, a state senator who offered a record that was every bit as conservative but without the celebrity. It was a sharp fall for Cawthorn, once viewed as a rising star in the Maga universe, and a rare win for the Republican party’s old guard, which aligned against him. Trump’s choice for Senate, the North Carolina congressman Tedd Budd, also triumphed. Trump’s early endorsement of the little-known House Republican reshaped the race, elevating a candidate who objected to the certification of 2020 election results in two states. He beat out the state’s former governor, Pat McCrory, who refused to say the 2020 election was stolen. Budd now faces the former state supreme court chief justice Cheri Beasley for the seat being vacated by the retiring Republican senator Richard Burr. If elected, Beasley would be the southern state’s first Black senator if elected. Trump’s choice in Idaho also came up short, failing to unseat the state’s Republican governor, Brad Little. Janice McGeachin, the state’s far-right lieutenant governor, who twice attempted a power grab while Little was out of state, had made Trump’s false claims of a stolen election a central plank of her candidacy. While much of the focus was on Trump’s influence over his party, Tuesday’s results tested Biden’s appeal among the party’s base. In Oregon, a progressive challenger, Jamie McLeod-Skinner, appeared on track to unseat the congressman Kurt Schrader, a seven-term incumbent with a reputation for breaking with his party. Schrader was the first candidate Biden endorsed this cycle, and his loss would be a major victory for the progressive movement. In Pennsylvania, Congressman Conor Lamb, an avowed centrist from the Biden wing of the party who won difficult races in Trump country, lost handily to the state’s lieutenant governor, John Fetterman, an iconoclastic progressive with blue-collar appeal. Meanwhile, Pennsylvania state representative Summer Lee, running for an open House seat, appeared to have overcome a wave of money from outside groups aiming to counter the progressive movement. If she wins the primary in the solidly Democratic district, Lee would be on track to become the first Black woman to represent Pennsylvania in Congress. “Our victory shows that we can overcome the billionaire class that wants to divide and conquer us all with fear and lies-for-profit, if only we come together across our differences for a positive vision of multiracial democracy,” Lee wrote on Twitter after declaring victory on Tuesday night. “We can have nice things, if we fight.”",News/US news,Republican ‘big lie’ supporters triumph in sign of Trump’s enduring power,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/18/republicans-trump-big-lie-primary-election-results
5/19/2022,"Gun sales in the US have soared in recent years as the nation struggles to come to terms with the latest mass shooting, a horrific racist attack in Buffalo. According to new figures from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the manufacture of firearms has tripled in two decades, and legal sales have risen sharply as well. Officials in New York confirmed that Payton Gendron, the 18-year-old accused of the Buffalo mass murder, legally obtained the AR-15 style rifle believed to be the weapon used in the attack from a New York guns store, despite being hospitalized last year for making a murder-suicide threat. Law enforcement officials have said they are not aware of any “red flags” that would have slowed or prevented the legal sales of the three guns the shooter allegedly brought to Tops Friendly Market on Saturday, including the one used in the attack. The ATF report comes as many states have loosened “carry” laws that allow for the possession of handguns for personal protection. Since 2009, handgun sales have outstripped rifles, the report found. Total sales rose from 3,040,934 in 1986 to peak in 2016 at 11,497,441. The report also pointed to a rise in the number of “ghost guns”, or untraceable, homemade weapons, in circulation. Law enforcement recovered 19,344 privately manufactured firearms in 2021, a tenfold increase since 2016. Officials have said ghost guns are contributing to the surge in gun-related killings. In California, ghost guns make up as many as half of weapons recovered at crime scenes. On a visit to Buffalo on Tuesday, Joe Biden told reporters that he would redouble his efforts “to convince Congress” to enact new gun control measures. “We’ve done it before,” the president said, referring to the 1994 assault weapons ban that slowed their spread before it lapsed in 2004. Biden said he would have “to convince Congress to go back to what I passed years ago”. “It’s going to be very difficult. But I’m not going to give up trying,” he said. The state’s Attorney General, Letitia James, said on Wednesday that her office is investigating the social media companies where the alleged gunman planned and promoted the attack. She tweeted that her office would investigate 4chan, 8chan, Discord, Twitch and any other platforms the shooter used. Gendron had been briefly hospitalized last spring after a teacher reported to school administrators that he’d written about wanting to carry out a shooting. But since he was not involuntarily committed to an institution his name was not added to any gun prohibition, or red flag, list. “I spent 20 hours in a hospital’s emergency room on 5/28/2021,” Gendron wrote in an online entry late last year. “This was because I answered murder/suicide to the question ‘what do you want to do when you retire?’ on an online assignment in my Economics class.” Sheriff John Garcia of Erie county, New York, told CNN: “In a case like this the gun dealer was able to sell these weapons to this individual because there was no red flags that came up.” However, Gendron crossed into Pennsylvania to obtain a 30-round magazine. “What has made this so lethal, and so devastating for this community, was the high-capacity magazine that would have had to have been purchased elsewhere, that’s not legal in the state of New York,” Governor Kathy Hochul of New York said on Sunday. Multiple high-capacity magazines were recovered on Gendron and in his car, Buffalo’s police commissioner, Joseph Gramaglia, said. Gendron wrote that using a drill he had modified a lock on the weapon designed to prevent the use of an extended magazine. It is believed he fired 50 rounds during the two-minute attack. Ten people, predominantly Black, were killed and the assault was live-streamed on Twitch. Robert Donald, the owner of Vintage Firearms, told the New York Times he had sold Gendron a Bushmaster rifle. “He didn’t stand out – because if he did, I would’ve never sold him the gun,” Donald said.",News/US news,"Buffalo shooting followed tripling of gun sales in 30 years, ATF figures reveal",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/18/gun-sales-us-stats-atf-report
5/19/2022,"The Bank of England this week joined the ranks of the “enemies of the people”. Damned for the governor’s gloomy but accurate assessment that UK consumers face an “apocalyptic” spike in food prices, the Bank found itself on the front pages of the populist press. The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street stood accused of being “asleep at the wheel” as prices soared. But hiking interest rates would not have stopped escalating costs. The Bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey, was right when he said that inflation – which reached a 40-year high of 9% – had been driven by international events. Covid supply chain disruptions, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Brexit are all beyond his control. Higher interest rates are not going to produce more oil or more wheat and bring down the prices of key commodities. The Bank did deliver a fourth successive increase this month to take its lending rate to 1%. Mr Bailey could argue that if he didn’t push up interest rates when other countries were raising theirs, the pound would depreciate – with potentially inflationary consequences. Workers have suffered two decades of stagnant pay. Inflation is more than double the average pay rise. Many workers are refusing to return to jobs at poor pay. So, it appears, the only way of filling vacancies is by making Britons desperate. That would explain why, despite all the crocodile tears about inflation harming ordinary people, ministers and the Bank are determined to stop wages rising. Labour must challenge this dreary orthodoxy. Its call for an emergency budget is the right one to make because only the government can spend the money to help people deal with the cost of living crisis – and signal a better future for workers. Ministers have been briefing that they are considering a “warm home discount” on energy bills for the poorest 3 million, and a 1p cut to the basic income tax rate, brought forward from next year. The former is a small step but a welcome one. The latter is a sop to richer voters as 80% of its benefit goes to the top half of earners. Inflation is not going anywhere soon – and it should be a reckoning for a free market ideology that has come to dominate our political life. If the Conservatives can argue that taxes must come down to deal with inflation, even at the cost of a higher deficit, then surely Labour can argue that public spending could be increased for the same reason. Higher benefits are needed so that the poorest people don’t have to choose between heating and eating. Governments ought to be able to cap housing and loan costs so that ordinary people don’t end up borrowing more just to survive. If oil and gas costs are going to remain high, then surely it is time to implement, in a substantial way, policies to transition to a less energy intensive future – such as free public transport and subsidies for green home renovations. The immediate causes of inflation should not mask the predatory factor of commodity speculation. Wall Street banks are regularly fined for manipulating prices. It is worth recalling that there was plenty of grain to feed the world in February. But provisioning food has turned, to paraphrase John Maynard Keynes, into a byproduct of the activities of a casino, with predictably calamitous results. It is astounding that the Bank of England does not understand these markets – surely a prerequisite for regulating them. The prevailing ideology of the last 40 years has blinded the public to alternatives by deliberately confining the boundaries of public debate. Only by seeing the world as it really is can voters change it. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

5/19/2022,"There are two traditional means by which MPs are held responsible for their actions. They face the judgment of voters in elections, and they are subject to discipline by party whips. Those are mostly political evaluations, and there is still a large realm where MPs are their own bosses, unchecked in the way that they use their power – able too often to abuse it. Whether parliament contains a disproportionate number of bullies and sexual predators relative to other workplaces is hard to measure. Not all allegations end up being substantiated, but the known cases already give cause for national shame. Last month, Imran Ahmad Khan, a Conservative MP, resigned after being found guilty of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy. David Warburton, MP for Somerton and Frome, has been suspended from the Tory party pending an inquiry by parliament’s Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS) into an accusation of sexual harassment. He denies the allegations. The ICGS was established in 2018, in response to the flood of stories that emerged when the #MeToo movement reached Westminster. According to one recent report, the scheme is currently considering around 70 complaints relating to 56 MPs, including cabinet and shadow cabinet ministers. This week, a Conservative MP was arrested by police on suspicion of rape and sexual assault. In December 2021, Andrew Griffiths, a former Tory minister, was found by a family court to have raped and physically abused his wife. In 2020, the former Tory MP Charlie Elphicke was jailed for two years after being found guilty of sexual assault. Both men were protected by colleagues when allegations were first made against them. A common thread in many cases is the sense of powerlessness and isolation induced in the victim by a politician who uses patronage and the aura of authority bestowed by his office to exert control. That imbalance makes it easier for the abuser to evade exposure, using his privileged position to discredit accusers and intimidate them into silence. It is a common template for abuse. It happens often in opaque and informal hierarchies, such as political parties, where a young woman can be made to feel that her place depends on tolerating the intolerable, and that she will not be believed if she dares to speak out. In whips’ offices, ideology and expediency too often trump decency and duty of care. None of this is new, nor is it exclusive to one end of the political spectrum. But it is a rot that spreads fastest when power is wielded with impunity, which is more often the condition in parties after long stints in office. That is the state of the current Conservative government. Westminster culture is changing. The era when MPs could behave as unchecked petty tyrants in their own personal fiefdoms is coming to an end. Victims of abuse and harassment are finding their voice. But the pace of change is too slow and, surveying the record, it is hard to escape the conclusion that the present government, stale and arrogant in its long incumbency, has been in power too long to be a credible source of renewal.

5/19/2022,"It felt very much like the end of days. An intellectually and morally bankrupt government lurching from one crisis to the next while the country is left to flatline. No one is even surprised these days when yet another Tory MP is accused of sex offences. While we don’t know what the truth of these new allegations will be, the fact that there are fresh claims is no more than people have come to expect. The MP hasn’t even been suspended as he would have been in any other workplace. The ongoing scandal at Westminster is one that might have proved fatally toxic for some administrations, but now has become normalised. Just wait for the next story to break. And with 56 MPs, including three cabinet ministers, being investigated for sexual misconduct, it may not be long before it does. The Commons was nowhere near full for the first prime minister’s questions of the new parliament. Many Tories had clearly decided they were better off out of Westminster than enduring the laboured ramblings of their leader. No one could really blame them. Waiting to take his place on the frontbench, Boris Johnson stood behind the Speaker’s chairs while several of his parliamentary private secretaries patted him down and tried to smarten him up. But Joy Morrissey had no joy. Despite her best efforts, the Convict still looked a complete state. Crumpled, ill-fitting suit held together only by the stains. Tired and pasty-faced. An unbrushed toddler haircut. Johnson can’t clean up his own act, let alone his party’s. With inflation rising to 9%, there was only ever going to be one subject on Keir Starmer’s mind, and he duly devoted all six of his questions to the cost of living. Labour was all in favour of a windfall tax. The Tories had voted against one, even though the chancellor had said only a few days ago that he hadn’t quite made up his mind yet. Rishi Sunak needed a few more people to starve before reaching a decision. So where did Johnson stand? The Convict scratched his head. Then his arse. Not the most attractive of habits. He looked puzzled. His mouth opened and a torrent of disconnected phrases poured out. Boris can no longer speak in complete sentences. Partly because he can’t be bothered, but mainly because he now has no coherent answers to anything. Speech is no longer a form of communication, but more a smokescreen. That’s when he’s not lying, of course. “Um … er,” he mumbled. It was like this. Starmer didn’t even know what a woman was. He seemed to think this was a killer putdown, but he didn’t even get any laughs from his own MPs. It was just random, tone-deaf nonsense. Playing the culture wars card while refusing to acknowledge the genuine hardships many people were suffering was not a good look. The Convict tried to change tack. The government was not, in theory, in favour of putting up taxes. Mmm. Possibly. But it definitely is in practice. Johnson and Sunak have done nothing but put up taxes since they took office. The Labour leader continued to do his own scratching. Though rather more productively, as he was pawing away at the open sore of the windfall tax. A tax that almost everyone in the country thought was a good idea. A tax on which it was inevitable the Tories would be forced to reverse-ferret on within a few weeks. Not that it would be called a windfall tax. That would be an admission that Labour had won the argument. So it would be an excessive profit levy. None of which helped the Convict in his short-term ambition of merely getting through the next half-hour. Because Johnson really didn’t know what he actually wanted, other than for Labour to stop bugging him and for the little people to be more grateful for what he was doing for them. Whatever that was. He couldn’t remember exactly, but he was sure it would come to him in the end. His performance lapsed from the incoherent to the pathetic. Nobody could have predicted the Ukraine war, but it was our duty to suffer alongside the Ukrainian people. The Ukrainians wouldn’t expect a windfall tax at such a time, and neither should we Brits. In fact, Starmer was appeasing Putin by demanding one. The Labour benches just looked bewildered. As did Tory backbenchers. Even by the Convict’s recent standards, this was deranged. Johnson is decomposing before our eyes. Being prime minister is something beyond his shallow talents. He can no longer cope. He was only ever in it for the good times. The parties. The status. The Being There. A tanking, stagflating economy and an imminent recession is beyond his compass. Starmer ended by telling the story of a man who could barely afford the costs of running the dialysis machine that kept him alive. Johnson was choosing to let people like him struggle. The Commons was unusually quiet as the Labour leader spoke, and Johnson should have been humbled. Except the Convict has no shame. The only pity he has is reserved strictly for himself. This was far too real for him, so he pawed the air, as if to bat Starmer away. Then he went on the attack. People should just be grateful they had jobs to do as they went hungry and cold. If they wanted luxuries, why didn’t they just get jobs that paid a bit more, like Rachel Maclean had said? Hell, he had taken a pay cut to be prime minister, so how about a bit of sympathy for his suffering? And what about some applause for Crossrail? That was all down to him. It wasn’t, of course. It had been Ken Livingstone’s idea. But hey, if the Convict wants to take the credit for an infrastructure project that was years late and massively over budget, then who are we to stop him? The rest of PMQs passed in a haze of anticlimactic apathy, the only highlight being Johnson insisting that no one worked well from home. He can speak for himself. Labour could only sit and wait. They could make suggestions, but there was nothing they could do to force the government to tackle the cost of living crisis. The Tories, too, could only sit and wait, though they only had their crippling indecision to blame. They knew the Convict was just a hollowed-out, corroded hulk. There was no saviour rising from the streets to come to their rescue.",News/Politics,Johnson is so short of answers he can no longer form complete sentences | John Crace,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/18/boris-johnson-pmqs-cost-of-living-crisis
5/19/2022,"The White House resumed its coronavirus briefings on Wednesday after a six-week hiatus as Covid-19 cases rose across the nation, with the new head of Covid response calling on Congress for additional funding to pay for vaccines and treatments. “I want to make sure we have enough resources so that we can buy enough vaccines for every American. I think that is absolutely critical. We do not have the resources to do that right now,” said Ashish Jha, the White House’s new coronavirus response coordinator, who replaced Jeff Zients in March. “So without additional funding from Congress, we will not be able to buy enough vaccines for every American who wants one.” The last White House coronavirus briefing was held on 5 April. Since then, various mask mandates have been lifted across the country, including those on planes, trains and in automobiles. Jha explained that the administration has not stopped fighting the virus, however, noting that it has increased its rapid test kits allocated to each household from four to eight kits. “We know there are multigenerational households, we know that there are households with more than four people and we want to make sure that we make as many tests as we can possibly make available,” he said. Jha also revealed that the administration has seen a dramatic increase in the use of the Covid-19 pill Paxlovid, with demand increasing fourfold in just the previous month. “Our latest estimates are that about 20,000 prescriptions of Paxlovid are being given out every day. I think that is actually a really important reason why, despite the very substantial increase in infections, we have not seen a commensurate increase in deaths,” Jha said. Jha also renewed his pleas for Congress to authorize additional funding so the government could purchase more vaccines and Covid-19 treatments. “If we don’t get more resources from Congress, what we will find in the fall and winter is … a period of time where Americans can look around and see their friends in other countries in Europe and Canada with access to these treatments that Americans would not have.” The resumed briefing comes as the US marks a painful milestone, with more than 1 million people officially counted dead since the pandemic began in March 2020, with the real number likely to be much higher. The US has one of the highest mortality rates in the world: 303 dead from Covid-19 out of every 100,000 residents, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The huge toll has set the US apart from other wealthy nations, in a crisis exacerbated by the country’s deep-rooted inequality, broken healthcare system and fraught politics. “In terms of understanding why we had such a bad experience from the pandemic, we have to think about the systemic issues that already were in place when the pandemic arrived,” Steven Woolf, a social epidemiologist and population health researcher at Virginia Commonwealth University, told the Guardian. “And, on top of that, mishandling of the pandemic by the government and by the public, frankly.” According to data from the New York Times, for the first time since 20 February, the daily average of Covid-19 cases in the country surpassed 100,000, marking a 61% rise from two weeks ago. Although deaths have been declining, hospitalizations have been on the rise: up by 25% in the past two weeks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director, Rochelle Walensky, reaffirmed the importance of booster shots at the briefing. “Our vaccine effectiveness cohort studies have shown Covid-19 vaccines generally remain effective in preventing severe disease, including protecting against Omicron. However, we also know that protection from Covid-19 vaccines wanes, or becomes less protective over time, especially in the Omicron era,” she said. “This is one of the reasons vaccine boosters are so important.”",News/US news,White House resumes Covid briefings after six-week hiatus as cases rise,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/18/covid-briefings-biden-white-house-us-cases-rising
5/19/2022,"Olivia Bennett’s VHS collection started at a charity stall. She had grown up in “the type of family where we’ll always have a movie on in the background,” she says, but it wasn’t until high school that her personal interest really bloomed. It was 2010 and DVD sales in Australia were booming. People were shedding their old VHS cassettes like dead skin. Many of them, apparently, found their way onto a Lifeline table operating out of the convention centre opposite Bennett’s house in Brisbane. At 50 cents for five, she couldn’t pass up the chance to snag a handful of beloved titles on the cheap (“It was a money thing”). And then another, and then another. “My mum and I would take trolleys … each time we were going in. And we’d go several times a day [a day] and sort through.” More than a decade on, she has a thousand-strong collection which adorns one entire living room wall in her family home – edge to edge – a wallpaper of plastic anachronisms. There are “obscure Disney films like Sword in the Stone and Pete’s Dragon,” she says, alongside cult classics like Jim Henson’s Labyrinth. In the photo she sends me, three copies of Lethal Weapon take pride of place. While she’s now moved interstate, her collection back in Brisbane has held steady throughout the advent – then stranglehold – of streaming. The movies themselves may have made the jump online, but one of Bennett’s treasured features has not: the pre-show ads in all their grainy, campy glory. “There’s always that ad that’s like, ‘Don’t pirate!’ … [and] there were a lot of theatrics to trailers. You know that classic American voiceover for all the trailers? Something about that voice reminds me of a specific time.” Nostalgia is a primary force driving collectors of physical film media, whose titles sometimes predate them. Bennett’s VHS tapes, she says, are a lens to experience “the 90s … a period of time that I was born in but didn’t necessarily get to grow up in”. For others, a commitment to hard copy is the only way to skirt around the fickle decisions of streaming services, where availability of titles is subject to an impenetrable alchemy of considerations: audience demand, the whims of licensing, and sheer storage capacity. “It’s insanely expensive to store stuff for it to be streamed,” says Dr Ari Mattes, a media lecturer at the University of Notre Dame, whose own DVD and VHS collection numbers somewhere in the 40,000s. “It’s not like going to a video store … you can’t have 50,000 titles on a streaming service.” Ben Kenny, the owner of the now-defunct Film Club – Sydney’s self-described “last, best” video store – agrees. “The only way to be sure that you’ll have access to something forever is to actually own a physical copy of it.” Over its decade-long life, Film Club gained a reputation for servicing “that five or 10% of whatever generation is obsessed with films,” says Kenny, who describes the community which formed around his store as “the island of misfit toys”. When it shuttered this February, collectors all around Sydney made the pilgrimage into Darlinghurst to snap up the goods in a closing sale. Titles went fast. Some, like a 2008 Criterion Collection version of Wong Kar-wai’s Chungking Express, had been long out of print, with resales on eBay costing hundreds of dollars. “We just got hit hard by people who had clearly been eyeing off things … customers knew the value of a lot of the stuff we had. But it was good to see it go to a good home.” The scarcity of some hard copy film editions isn’t all that different to rare books, says Geoff Gardner, the founder of Cinema Reborn, a boutique film festival in Sydney dedicated to screening classics seldom seen on the big screen. There are ways, of course, to bypass the shortcomings of streaming services through what he winkingly calls “the backchannels” and “the illegitimate”, but it doesn’t compare to the solidity of “filing it away, putting it in the box”. “It’s the same as the book collector’s mentality.

But that’s nothing, he goes to great pains to emphasise, compared to fellow cinephiles. “A lot of people are very, very remorseless … they’ll spend hours in the DVD shops [overseas] finding films that have not been released in other places, but have been released in Italy, Spain, or Japan.” The subculture Gardner describes is holding steadfast. But could it ever experience a proper resurgence – like its cousin, the vinyl revival of the last decade? “With vinyl, the audio quality is actually better in terms of the range that you’re able to hear, which isn’t the case with DVDs,” says Mattes, “[But there’ll always be] something about a physical medium – the tactility of it … There’s just something innately comforting about that.”. A return to older formats, even for the average viewer, says Mattes, might also go some way in alleviating selection fatigue – the hours spent scrolling online, undone by the tyranny of choice. “Say you’re a normal person, not like me with an insane number [of titles] … when you go to pick something, it limits your choice in a really productive way. “You can look at your collection and go, ‘okay, I’ve got [a finite] number to pick from’ … instead of the absolute doubt that you have on streaming. “[There’ll always be] something about a physical medium – the tactility of it … There’s just something innately comforting about that.”",Arts/Film,‘There’s something comforting about it’: the collectors who won’t let go of their DVDs and videos,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/19/theres-something-comforting-about-it-the-collectors-who-wont-let-go-of-their-dvds-and-videos
5/19/2022,"Amal Naser initially believed the election was a chance for change, particularly for the Muslim community, and for western Sydney. But as the election enters its final week, Naser now says it is a choice between a “lesser evil” and Scott Morrison. “No one sees Labor as a party they would feel very incentivised to vote for, except for the fact that they want to vote the Liberal government out,” she says. The 21-year-old law student says that while Labor has a “longstanding relationship” with the Muslim community, that relationship is now “hanging by a thread.” “There are barely any policies, definitely nothing radical, proposed by the Labor party that is actively mobilising the Muslim community, particularly younger Muslims.” Naser reflects a changing attitude within western Sydney’s Muslim community, one that is less afraid of raising concerns and demanding better representation. But there is a frustration at the level of engagement from both parties, largely attributed to the fact that many of the electorates where Muslims live in New South Wales are largely Labor safe seats, such as Blaxland, Fowler and Watson. The same dynamic plays out in Victoria, with Muslims concentrated in the Labor safe seats of Wills, Calwell and Maribyrnong. According to the 2016 census, 59.2% of residents in Lakemba identify as Muslim, and at the 2019 election, Labor won Watson (which includes Lakemba, Greenacre, and Punchbowl, all with sizeable Muslim populations) by 13.5%. Some polling booth results in Lakemba showed the Labor vote at over 75%. But neighbouring seats in western Sydney with smaller Muslim populations, such as Lindsay and Banks, have already flipped, with many others in the region becoming marginal. A recent report from the Centre for Western Sydney found a growing “electoral volatility” in western Sydney, predicting that the region will no longer be a stronghold for either major party. It listed growing political literacy combined with lower levels of education attainment, and higher rates of multilingualism, cultural diversity and religious faith as major reasons for the shifting landscape. Naser, who lives in the seat of Banks, thinks the shift can be somewhat attributed to Labor’s attitude toward the community. “If the Labor party hadn’t taken our community for granted for so many years, and actively work with our community on the plethora of issues that we face, and a more radical platform, then people might have felt a greater need to vote for them,” she said. A generational shift in the community, from early migrants seeking to establish themselves in the 80s and 90s to a second and third generation that is wealthier and more educated, is also reshaping priorities for Muslim voters. Dr Lobna Yassine, lecturer in social work and policy studies at the University of Sydney, says that she is voting for the Greens at this election, breaking away from a family tradition of voting Labor. “I voted Labor without thought or question because my parents voted Labor,” she said. “People of my parents’ generation tried very hard to influence policies, without causing too much discomfort or disruption. I think this makes sense in the context of their limited power, and by the fact that they were pretty much limited to the two major parties.” “Liberal positioned as more conservative on issues like immigration, and Labor more compassionate on issues of immigration and welfare policy.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Yassine explains that the changing demographics of the Muslim community was causing the electoral landscape to shift, with growing rates of education, more professionals and greater wealth resulting in changing priorities. “We are now in a position to say “if you do not share our priorities or our concerns, we will take away our vote and place it with a party that does”. “In my community, a lot of us are constantly talking about other issues of concern such as atrocities committed by Israel, equality for First Nations people and Black Lives Matter, climate change, and gender equality.” Yassine says the changes are creating a “split” within the community, between those who want to maintain the traditional relationship with Labor and power, and those who want to take charge of their vote. And it is resulting in changes to their expectations of religious leaders. “There is conflict within the community about whether or not we should be continuing to invite parties into our community events, despite their lack of commitment to the issues that concern us directly.” She says hundreds of people have boycotted Lakemba mosque, one of the most prominent mosques in the country, for inviting politicians without attempting to hold them to account. These divisions have left the community without a clear sense of who to support, and which party would actually act in their interests. Lakemba mosque did not respond to requests for comment. A Labor spokesperson denied the party had taken the community for granted, and blamed Scott Morrison for communities feeling disenfranchised. “It is understandable that multicultural communities would feel disenfranchised when they see Scott Morrison turning up only for photo ops and pork barreling. “What we’ve heard is the issues that are concerning Muslim Australians are the cost-of-living crisis, housing affordability and job stability.” “Of course there’s always more we can do – and we don’t take our relationships with Muslim communities for granted.” Criminologist and former executive director of the Islamic Council of Victoria (ICV) Mohamad Tabbaa calls it a “double bind”, explaining that Muslims don’t fit neatly on a political spectrum between the left and right. “They must vote in one direction or another, and yet doing so necessarily brings a harm to themselves and to their communities,” he said “The double bind puts Muslims in unhealthy relation with themselves and their communities.” “Muslims do not face a general lack of choice, they face a lack of choices that understand their concerns and needs, that allow them to vote with the dignity of not betraying themselves, their communities and their values.” A growing distance between assumptions made of the community, and approaches made by the major parties was reflected in a recent community survey that showed rightwing extremism and Islamophobia were two major concerns they held. My Vote Matters ran the survey, and found 53% of respondents said they were “extremely concerned” about Islamophobia, with 46% saying they were just as concerned about rightwing extremism. Religious freedoms were also overwhelmingly supported, with 96% saying they wanted to see legislation that protects their ability to live by their religious principles. Adel Salman, current president of the ICV, the organisation behind My Vote Matters, defined religious freedoms for Muslims as being about preventing vilification and discrimination on the basis of religion, as well as preserving their right to live by their values. “At its core, it is about preserving your rights and upholding the rights of people of faith to live by their values, and to educate and raise their children according to those values.” “Those things are under assault at the moment,” he added. Salman says that while there is greater interest in the Coalition, the relationship between the Muslim community and Labor has been fracturing for some time. “It fell apart at the last election,” he says “Muslims have been feeling betrayed by Labor, in that they are not representing their views or values.” “Among the Muslim community, you’ll still have those who are diehard Labor, but the Labour party is on notice now, they cannot take the Muslim vote for granted.”",News/Australia news,‘Taken for granted’: western Sydney’s Muslim community rethinks a fractured Labor relationship,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/19/taken-for-granted-western-sydneys-muslim-community-rethinks-a-fractured-labor-relationship
