3/6/2022,"Strange, isn’t it, in this era of horrors, that a once-in-a-generation, definitive TV show about teenagers is so unrelentingly bleak. In many ways, one can only hope that Euphoria is not definitive, because it makes being 17 look even less appealing than actually being 17 did. Its characters are a painful mess of drugs, addictive behaviour and self-destruction. Were it not for the calibre of its performances, particularly from Zendaya as Rue, it would be borderline unwatchable. Her Disney-to-grit transformation is remarkable, and she anchors the series. Viewers love it and the show has become staggeringly popular. Last week, Euphoria’s US channel, HBO, revealed that the series is its second-most watched programme since 2004, behind only the behemoth that was Game of Thrones. It almost doubled its audience with its second season, which recently ended, and has become the most tweeted-about show of the decade. It was so ubiquitous on social media that it became possible to follow the drama without watching it and arguably some of the many memes that sprang up around it were better written than the show itself. Over to the more wobbly set side of TV and the Australian soap Neighbours finally confirmed it would end in the summer, after 37 years on air. It had been coming for some time, after Channel 5 dropped the show, leaving it with “no option” but to cease production. I haven’t watched Neighbours for years, if not decades, and the outpouring of nostalgia for it is both sweet and of the Woolworth’s variety, that particular retrospective fondness for something few have paid much attention to for a long time. Inevitably, I thought of my own Neighbours era, in my late teens, when we gathered round the communal TV every lunchtime. That was teen TV, with a bit of late-era Buffy on the side; hardly harrowing, despite the trauma of the Karl/Izzy/Susan affair. Now, more than ever, it is desperately easy to get sucked into a “we didn’t know we were born” mentality, but when I thought about the difference between what we consumed then and the options now, I couldn’t help but laugh. As an adult, I found this season of Euphoria to be too bleak for me. Perhaps I have aged out of it. But I can’t say for sure that it is not definitive and I wonder if its heaviness comes at a time when anything lighter would seem like a relic of the past. In among the many celebrations taking place to mark the 100 years since James Joyce published Ulysses, and you could do worse than treating yourself to a glance at Virginia Woolf’s increasingly irate account of reading it, a sweet Ulysses-related story appeared on BBC News that felt like a celebration of its own. A mysterious, beautifully bound edition of the novel, from 1936, was donated to the Tenovus charity shop in Cardiff and almost went on sale for £1. (There are few satisfactions greater in life than a charity shop find, a moment of joy that makes all of the duds worth it. For example, it was well worth buying a sleeping bag for dogs, even though dogs aren’t as keen on miniature sleeping bags as you’d think, in order to find a signed copy of the Duchess of Devonshire’s memoir Counting My Chickens.) “Because I’m not sure on books I would have literally put this book out for £1,” said the charity shop’s manager, Carl Scott. But a colleague recognised it might be worth something and saved it from its £1 fate. It will go to auction in a couple of weeks, where it is expected to fetch more than £800 for Tenovus Cancer Care. The small screen is overrun by adaptations of true stories, which are the new reboots in terms of television revealing the limits of its imagination. They all start with a disclaimer, explaining that they’re based on true events, but might, wink wink, have made some things up for the purposes of entertainment. The most queasy of the lot has been Pam & Tommy, dramatising the story of Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee’s romance and the theft and leaking of their sex tape. It was widely pointed out that Anderson’s lack of involvement, and rumours about her lack of approval, made the whole thing seem particularly off, given that it was about a woman being violated in the first place. It didn’t help that the series seemed not to know what it was trying to say. With mic-drop timing, Anderson has announced she will be telling her side of the story after all, just not in the form of a drama that features a talking penis. The star posted a handwritten note on Instagram, entitled My Life, in the form of a sort of declaration of independence. “Not a victim but a survivor and alive to tell the real story,” she wrote. This will appear as a Netflix documentary, directed by Ryan White, who made The Keepers, a series about murder, child abuse and the Catholic church; Netflix says Anderson’s life will be recounted “in her own words this time”. It is only fair that she has the chance to reclaim her own experiences.

3/6/2022,"“Two years of nights have turned me into a nocturnal animal,” growls Robert Pattinson’s Batman to no one in particular. The streets of Gotham City are slick with rain and sleaze; defending them is weary work. Nirvana’s dirge-like Something in the Way plays to better illustrate the point. Back at the Batcave, he swaps his cape for a hoodie and dusts off his diary, pushing his greasy, Kurt Cobain-style curtains out of his eyes as he writes down his woes. And that’s just the opening. Not to worry – there’s no shortage of brooding in Matt Reeves’s bloated three-hour take on the DC Comics superhero. Batman movies are usually goofy or dour; this film is in the latter camp, styled as a neo-noir revolving around rats, moles and the mob. In the run-up to the mayoral elections, the incumbent is brutally murdered by an empowered incel type who broadcasts his crimes on social media. When this killer leaves a perplexing note for the Batman, police lieutenant James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) enlists the help of the city’s unofficial guardian angel to help solve the riddle. As a standalone police procedural, it works quite well, but as a franchise reboot it’s not enough of a reset. Zoë Kravitz is a highlight as cocktail waitress turned cat burglar Selina Kyle. Feline with a feral edge, she stomps around in thigh-high PVC boots, bonding with the Batman over their shared daddy issues and penchant for fetishwear. As her character puts it, Gotham’s “white privileged assholes” keep turning up dead. Bruce Wayne, the man behind the Batman’s mask, could be described this way too. R-Patz plays him with an appealing vulnerability, a well-meaning philanthropist buckling under the weight of white guilt.",Arts/Film,The Batman review – Robert Pattinson’s brooding caped crusader has a lot on his mind,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/05/the-batman-review-robert-pattinson-zoe-kravitz-matt-reeves
3/6/2022,"Government officials were warned repeatedly about making misleading claims about job figures before the official statistics watchdog reprimanded Boris Johnson over the matter. Ed Humpherson, the director general of the UK Statistics Authority (UKSA), said there had been “a series of informal discussions” before the regulator took the “unusual” step of issuing public rebukes to No 10 over the same issue twice last month. During more than half a dozen editions of prime minister’s questions since November, Johnson has made the misleading claim that more people are in employment in the UK than before the pandemic began. Yet, although the numbers of workers on payrolls has risen, the number of self-employed people has dropped significantly so that the total number of people in work is down by 600,000. The chair of the UKSA, Sir David Norgrove, wrote to Johnson saying he was making “a selective use of data” and added that “public trust requires a complete statement”. A few weeks earlier, Humpherson had written about the same matter to Laura Gilbert, Downing St’s chief analyst, saying the use of payroll figures was “disappointing”. “This is not something we do lightly – we don’t have an objective to get a certain amount of column inches,” Humpherson told the Observer. “And this is not an intervention at a personal level. We are clarifying the correct interpretation of those statistics. In a sense, we’re on the side of the statistics. We are a referee in the debate. “I had written to the head of data science in No 10 about this issue. And that itself followed a series of informal discussions where we said ‘we think you need to look again at how these numbers are being referred to’.” Humpherson said politicians and civil servants usually respond well to interventions by the statistics watchdog. “We don’t have to do this very often because by and large politicians and the people who brief politicians try really hard to get it right. And the general experience is that when they don’t quite get it right, they welcome the clarification that we provide.” But he conceded that the fact that the UKSA had written repeatedly to the prime minister about his use of employment figures was unusual. “It’s unusual. We had to write twice to Matt Hancock about testing data in May and early June 2020,” Humperhson said. “It is unusual, but not without precedent.”Humpherson welcomed the declaration on government reform that the prime minister and the cabinet secretary made last year, to build greater expertise in government on data. “It was really strong on the role of data, the role of analysis and the role of validation. That’s brilliant,” he said. Referring to initiatives such as the coronavirus dashboard, he said: “The data revolution within government has been happening over time, but the pandemic really accelerated that.” He said there was a recognition that data was more useful when it was linked together from several sources, and the Office for National Statistics’s new Integrated Data Service was doing this across government. “The risk is that the data stays close to the chest,” he said. “And actually what the pandemic shows is that there is a public appetite to make it available.”",News/Politics,Downing St was repeatedly warned over Boris Johnson’s misleading jobs claims,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/05/downing-st-was-repeatedly-warned-over-boris-johnsons-misleading-jobs-claims
3/6/2022,"Sixteenth-century madrigals written by an Italian Renaissance female composer are to be performed for the first time in 400 years after the discovery of missing parts of the original music. Maddalena Casulana became the first female composer to publish her own music at a time when such creativity was far from encouraged in women. She believed that men were making a “futile error” in assuming that women could not compose as well as they could and she brought out three books of madrigals under her name between 1568 and 1583, although only one of those collections has survived complete. Now a further 17 madrigals have been added to her small surviving repertoire and 12 of those will be premiered on 8 March as part of BBC Radio 3’s special programming for International Women’s Day. In what is seen as one of the most important musicological discoveries of recent years, Laurie Stras, professor of music at the universities of Southampton and Huddersfield, has tracked down the lost alto partbook of Casulana’s 1583 book of five-voice madrigals, with such evocative titles as Breeze that Murmurs in the Woods. Vocal or instrumental polyphonic music was handwritten or printed in the 15th and 16th centuries in partbooks, with each part appearing separately. Stras said that Casulana’s madrigals could not have been performed without the missing parts: “It would be like performing a string quintet without the second violin. It wouldn’t have made sense. I’ve been able to complete it. The jigsaw puzzle has slotted into place.” She tracked down missing parts from the printed edition to the Russian State Library in Moscow, piecing together the music through other fragments in the Gdańsk Library of the Polish Academy of Sciences. It was from that Polish archive that the missing parts had disappeared in the second world war. They were presumably looted. They still bear Gdańsk’s catalogue numbers. Stras said: “The reason that these madrigals are really important is that Casulana was acknowledged by her male contemporaries as a wonderful composer. She would have had to have been. We talk about women today having to be twice as good as men. That’s exactly what it was like then. These five-voice madrigals show us why she was such an extraordinary composer and why her contemporaries thought so highly of her. She is on the cutting-edge of composition in the 16th century. She uses really interesting harmonic effects. “What we will get from hearing these madrigals is a sense of what’s considered really top-quality composition in her lifetime. She’s as good as any of the masters of her day. The closest comparison is Monteverdi’s teacher, Marc’Antonio Ingegneri, a composer of church music and madrigals.” Casulana, who was also a lutenist and singer, was only too aware that, as a female composer, her music would be judged inferior to works created by her male counterparts. Her 1568 book of madrigals bears an extraordinary dedication to her illustrious patron, Isabella de’ Medici Orsini, daughter of Cosimo I de’ Medici and an amateur musician. She wrote: “These first fruits of mine, flawed as they are … show the world the futile error of men, who believe themselves patrons of the high gifts of intellect, which according to them cannot also be held in the same way by women.” But her male contemporaries recognised her talent. One called her the “muse and siren of our age”. Another described her music, performed at the wedding of Wilhelm V of Bavaria, as “most beautiful”. Noting that little is known about Casulana, who is thought to have died in 1590, Stras said: “How did she get to be so good? Where did she get that knowledge and that skill, because you’re not just born with being able to write five-voice polyphony. It’s really hard.”",Arts/Music,Groundbreaking female composer’s lost madrigals to be heard for first time in 400 years,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/05/maddalena-casulana-missing-renaissance-madrigals-rediscovered
3/6/2022,"After the war in Ukraine led German chancellor Olaf Scholz to pivot dramatically last week on his country’s postwar creeds of faith, attention is shifting to his predecessors, who took Germany down a strategic path towards Russia that became a dead end. The conflict in the east has caused a seismic shift in Germany, where Scholz has made a U-turn on a restrictive stance on weapons exports, announced huge increases in military spending and vowed to wean the country off Russian gas. Since then, all eyes have been on Gerhard Schröder, the unrepentant ex-chancellor who in his final weeks in power shook hands with Vladimir Putin to ratify the Nord Stream pipeline underneath the Baltic Sea. Just weeks later, Schröder slipped effortlessly through the revolving door to become chairman of Nord Stream. The resultant increase in Germany’s reliance on Russian energy, politicians in Berlin now concede, may have led Putin to believe Germany would be too hamstrung to support concerted economic sanctions. As a paid-up lobbyist of energy giant Gazprom, Schröder’s motivation is transparent: on Friday, Scholz called on his party colleague and former boss to sever ties with Russian state-owned companies. Less clear is why Schröder’s course of expanding economic ties with Russia was broadly continued by his successor, Angela Merkel, and whether she did so purely out of passivity or to her political advantage. When Merkel ended her 16-year tenure in December, political obituaries singled out her dealings with Putin for praise: her support for economic sanctions over the occupation of Crimea, as well as the rescue effort she initiated to have the poisoned dissident Alexei Navalny treated at a Berlin hospital, spoke of anything but naivety in her interactions with the Kremlin. But since last week, voices have been growing louder in criticising her sidelining of the foreign policy and security experts who warned her against seeing Russia as a reliable partner in trade. “A sober assessment of the German government’s misjudgments in its dealings with Russia over the last 16 years is now overdue,” said CDU politician and former Bundeswehr officer Roderich Kiesewetter. “To Nato’s great surprise, France and Germany in 2008 blocked a Membership Action Plan for Georgia, warning that Russia would interpret it as an existential threat. But four months later, Russia invaded Georgia anyway. In 2014-2015, when the US wanted to arm Ukraine over Russia’s annexation of Crimea, Merkel and [then French president François] Hollande opposed such a strategy, instead investing in diplomatic efforts,” Kiesewetter told the Observer. “But in the shadow of such seeming diplomatic successes, Russia continued to build up its military threat.” There are also fresh questions over Merkel’s unwavering support for the Nord Stream project, whose first pipeline she ceremonially unveiled in 2011. “With Nord Stream, it is now apparent that Germany was simply tricked by the Russian side: this was always a political and not a commercial project,” said Kiesewetter. “Germany never addressed the European and the security dimension of the project.” In Merkel’s first term in power, a certain naivety towards the pipeline project could still be explained by her power-sharing arrangement with a Social Democratic Party (SPD) still moulded in Schröder’s image, and centre-left state premiers with openly pro-Russian sympathies in Germany’s north-eastern states, particularly in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. “In her home state, and in her constituency, Nord Stream was always an extremely popular undertaking,” said Claudia Müller, a Green delegate from the same region. “When it came to Russia, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern effectively ran its own shadow diplomacy.” Even after her re-election in 2009, Merkel supported the continuation and expansion of a pipeline, insisting for years it was a purely “economic project”, even if she later conceded that certain “political factors” could not be ignored. “Economic pragmatism in dealing with Russia wasn’t just a feature of the Social Democrats’ romanticism,” said Jana Puglierin, head of the European Council on Foreign Relations’ Berlin office. “Merkel, too, believed that through trade you could bind Russia into a multilateral system, and thus a rules-based order. Even after 2014-2015, when the alarm bells were ringing, she compartmentalised the problem. She simply didn’t turn it into a political issue.” Research by Policy Network Analytics, a non-profit data intelligence network that connects political decisions to strategic economic investments, suggests Nord Stream’s political dimension may have been more apparent to her than she has let on. Merkel was raised in Germany’s north-east, where she won a direct mandate from a constituency covering the Baltic Sea island of Rügen. In the federalised political system, parliamentarians are not expected to act as amplifiers of their own regional concerns, and the chancellor even less so. Yet in the summer of 2009, her home state crashed on to the national agenda: the Wadan Yards shipbuilding company in Schwerin and Rostock filed for insolvency. With national elections looming three months later, Merkel faced a humiliating loss of 2,700 jobs on her home turf. Six weeks before the country went to the polls, Merkel’s press office announced a breakthrough: “The rescue of the Wadan Yards is in sight”. At a meeting in Sochi, Merkel and Russian president Dmitry Medvedev had brokered a deal whereby the shipyards would be bought by Vitaly Yusufov, saving half of the jobs at the company. Until then, the 29-year-old Yusufov had worked as head of the Moscow office of a certain Russian pipeline company: Nord Stream AG. His father, Igor, served as energy minister during Putin’s first term and was at the time coordinating Russia’s energy cooperations as a special envoy. “There was considerable political pressure for Wadan Yards to be rescued, and it’s questionable whether the deal would have gone through so quickly without it”, said Klaus-Peter Schmidt-Deguelle, a communications adviser who was on the company’s advisory board at the time. Even at the time, there had been rumours that the shipyards’ insolvent previous owner, Russian investor Andrei Burlakov, had merely been a straw man for a Russian mafia money-laundering plot, an allegation also made by a Spanish state prosecutor investigating Russian criminals’ activities in Spain. (A criminal investigation into laundering was discontinued by the state prosecutor in Schwerin in 2012, due to lack of cooperation from the Russian side). “If Burlakov was a straw man, he stopped playing that role at some point, or otherwise he would still be alive,” Schmidt-Deguelle told the Observer. In September 2011, the Russian investor was shot by a hitman in a Moscow restaurant. According to the German communiqué about the Sochi meeting, Merkel and Medvedev not only discussed a rescue deal for the Wadan Yards but also potential Russian investment in the struggling German carmaker Opel and the micro-chip manufacturer Infineon. Neither of those plans ever materialised, to Moscow’s disgruntlement. Russian media, however, reported that the two leaders were also to discuss an “energy cooperation”. According to Nord Stream AG, planning for the second pipeline was put in motion two years later, though its exact origins have never been openly communicated. Asked by the Observer via email if the energy cooperation discussed at Sochi was the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, and whether the economic cooperations debated were contingent on one another, Merkel’s office declined to give an answer, referring instead to the only public statement she has made since the start of the war in Ukraine. “There is no justification for this blatant breach of international law,” Merkel said four days after the start of the Russian invasion. “This war of aggression by Russia marks a profound turning point in the history of Europe after the end of the cold war.”",News/World news,Germany agonises over Merkel’s legacy: did she hand too much power to Putin?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/05/germany-angela-merkel-power-to-vladimir-putin-russia
3/6/2022,"Life after Marcelo Bielsa at Leeds does not look dull but for all the promise, fun and trademark buccaneering style, there was a painfully familiar outcome as Jesse Marsch’s first game in charge of the club ended in a slender defeat. Leeds piled forward with their typical gusto and despite creating countless chances, they departed Leicester with nothing to show for an encouraging performance after Harvey Barnes’s cool second-half finish earned his side back-to-back wins. Leeds have not kept a clean sheet since November and while suffering another pounding never appeared likely, improving the Premier League’s leakiest defence must be high on Marsch’s list of priorities. Brendan Rodgers paid tribute to Bielsa in his programme notes, saying he believes “the Premier League will be a poorer place without his values”. A first glimpse of Leeds in the post-Bielsa era made for exciting viewing. Leeds flexed between a 4-2-3-1 and the 4-2-2-2 formation Marsch favoured at Red Bull Salzburg to ensure Daniel James was rarely isolated. The first half was played at a frenetic pace, James whistling a shot wide inside the opening couple of minutes and Leeds did not relent. Marsch conceded he was not in pursuit of perfection but there were plenty of positives for him to scribble on a notepad tucked into his overcoat. Junior Firpo found joy marauding forward from left-back and Rodrigo, one of two changes from the team dismantled at home to Tottenham, blasted over after a move he started but the killer blow eluded them. Leeds kept Kasper Schmeichel busy on his 461st Leicester appearance – the third-highest tally of any player in the club’s history – and Raphinha would have converted Firpo’s cross at the front post had the Denmark goalkeeper not somehow saved the ball with his legs. Daniel Amartey, again operating at centre-back, prevented Jack Harrison from taking aim at the Leeds goal, blocking after the winger wound up a shot from the edge of the box. The Leeds substitute Joe Gelhardt also went close within seconds of entering. Stuart Dallas played a cute pass into Mateusz Klich, who slipped in Raphinha down the right and he centred the ball. Gelhardt gathered the ball with his first touch and skewered a shot, which was deflected, narrowly wide. Leicester appeared out of sorts and perhaps for good reason. Rodgers was again forced to name a makeshift defence owing to the injury sustained to Ricardo Pereira in victory over Burnley in midweek and Hamza Choudhury, filling in, looked uncomfortable at right-back. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall was graceful in midfield and Barnes’s goal on 67 minutes was equally neat. He played a crisp one-two with the substitute Kelechi Iheanacho, controlling the ball on his left foot and sweeping a right-footed shot into the far corner beyond Illan Meslier with his next touch. It was just the lift Leicester required, Rodgers punching both fists into the air. Leeds may have consigned a miserable February to the past but there is no guarantee things will get better.",Sport/Football,Leicester’s Harvey Barnes punishes Leeds to hand Jesse Marsch losing start,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/05/leicester-leeds-premier-league-match-report
