4/16/2022,"Elon Musk offered to buy Twitter (TWTR) for $54.20 per share in a filing made public Thursday, calling it his ""best and final offer."" But the Tesla (TSLA) CEO will have to reconsider that offer if he’s serious about taking over the social media company, according to one analyst. “No one believes this is the final price. No board in America is going to take that number,” said Jefferies analyst Brent Thill. Twitter shares jumped 4% on news of the all-cash offer, before falling in the afternoon session Thursday. In the amended SEC filing, Musk wrote his offer to pay $54.20 per share amounted to a 54% premium on the stock, compared to its price the day before Musk began investing in the company. But in comments at TED2022 Musk cast doubt on his plan to take Twitter private, saying, “I’m not sure I will actually be able to acquire it.” “The intent is to retain as many shareholders as is allowed by the law in a private company,” he said. “So, it's definitely not from the standpoint of let me figure out how to monopolize or maximize my ownership of Twitter.” Musk added that his move was not about finding a way ""to make money."" “I don’t care about the economics at all,” he said. Regardless of Musks’ motives, Thill said his offer simply doesn’t add up for Twitter’s board, in part because the billionaire hasn’t laid out how he plans to ""transform"" the company. Thill also alluded to Musk’s use of the number “420,” a popular reference to marijuana, as ""borderline unprofessional."" “It's not going to be anything with a 420, OK, so take that out. Bring the bid to $60 and then put together a constructive structure around how they would run it,” Thill said. “Then maybe, maybe, but that's what it’s going to take.” Twitter publicly acknowledged the takeover offer Thursday, saying in a statement that it plans to “carefully review the proposal to determine the course of action that it believes is in the best interest of the Company and all Twitter stockholders.” But behind the scenes, the board reportedly views the offer as ""unwelcome,"" suggesting it is willing to put up a fight, according to The Information. The potential battle comes just five months after new CEO Parag Agrawal assumed leadership from Twitter Co-founder Jack Dorsey last fall. Thill said Musk’s offer could open the door to other bidders interested in the social media company, although Washington’s increased antitrust scrutiny on big tech firms will likely prevent any deal from getting done. “It's hard because the government is going to say no to any large transaction even if the rest of tech wanted to do this,” Thill said. “It’s hard to see who the next logical player will be.” Akiko Fujita is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.

4/16/2022,"Most Americans have less in their retirement accounts than they’d like, and much less than the rules say they should have. So, obviously, if that describes you then you’re not alone. Now, most financial advisors recommend that you have between five and six times your annual income in a 401(k) account or other retirement savings account by age 50. With continued growth over the rest of your working career, this amount should generally let you have enough in savings to retire comfortably by age 65. Consider working with a financial advisor as you flesh out your retirement plan. What Your Retirement Savings Should Look Like by Age 50 Financial experts sometimes suggest planning for your retirement income to be about 80% of your pre-retirement income. So, for example, someone who earned $100,000 per year going into retirement would plan on having about $80,000 per year while retired. The reason for this discrepancy is that most households tend to have fewer needs and responsibilities while in retirement, and therefore fewer expenses. The only major exception to this rule is when it comes to healthcare. You should expect those costs to rise in your later years. To make your savings last, financial experts recommend that you plan on withdrawing about 4% per year from your retirement fund. This will depend on three main factors: How much money you have in your retirement fund The average rate of return that your retirement fund generates Your anticipated Social Security income So, for example, say you plan on needing $80,000 per year in retirement. First, you should look up how much money you can expect each month from Social Security. This income will depend on how much you made during your working life, as well as when you choose to retire. If you are an average Social Security recipient it will come to approximately $1,650 a month, or $19,800 a year. So you should plan on withdrawing an additional $60,200 per year to make up the difference. Applying the 4% rule of thumb, $60,200/0.04, suggests that this household will want about $1.5 million in their retirement fund. Other, more conservative, recommendations suggest making these plans without accounting for Social Security. In that case, you would want about $2 million in your retirement fund.

Sign up today. The 4% rule may entail withdrawing too much. It comes from, in part, conservative estimates of your retirement fund’s returns. By the time you retire you should have shifted your portfolio to safe assets. Many retirement funds, with comparatively safe assets, will have a return rate of around 3% to 5% by this point, allowing you to hover right around the replacement rate for your withdrawals. So someone who earns $100,000 per year will want to have around $1.5 million in their retirement fund by age 65. At age 50, then, many experts suggest that this retiree would need to have – at a bare minimum – around $600,000 up in a 401(k), or other tax-advantaged account. That would give the retiree 15 years to boost their retirement nest egg by an additional $900,000, or grow by an average of $60,000 annually for each of the next 15 years. That is unlikely to happen without significant capital appreciation in the retiree’s tax-advantaged account. Many advisors recommend seeking a rate of return around 7% to 8% to reach the needed $1.5 million. Reaching the Retirement Finish Line Besides making sure that the asset allocation of your retirement fund is sufficiently aggressive, there are at least four other steps you can take to get from $600,000 at 50 to $1.5 million at 65. Max Out Your Catch-Up Contributions This is the most important thing you can do. The IRS limits how much you can contribute to 401(k), individual retirement account (IRA) and Roth IRA in a single year. After you turn 50 it raises the cap, allowing you to make what are called “catch up contributions.” In 2022, for example, most workers can only contribute up to $20,500 to their 401(k) account. However, anyone age 50 or older can contribute up to $27,000. That extra $6,500 is significant, and between age 50 and age 65 it has time to add up to something very real. Take advantage of it. Open Simultaneous Retirement Funds The IRS allows you to contribute to a 401(k), an IRA and a Roth IRA in the same year. However, there is overlap between the contribution limits for an IRA and a Roth IRA. If you are already maximizing your contribution limits to your 401(k) but are still concerned that it isn’t enough, consider opening an IRA or a Roth IRA to supplement your savings. Doing so will allow you to put money into multiple retirement accounts at the same time, helping you to boost your savings considerably. If you already have simultaneous retirement accounts, consider simply opening an earmarked account. Even though it won’t see the same tax advantages, there’s no reason that you can’t save for retirement with an ordinary investment portfolio. You can put as much money into it as you like then just plan on leaving it there for retirement. Manage Debt, Manage Spending An excellent way to free up some cash is to stop making interest payments on debt. If you have existing debt, paying it off more quickly will reduce the amount that you spend on interest and fees. This will, in turn, give you more cash to dedicate toward your retirement account. When it comes to long-term debt, like a mortgage, paying it off more aggressively can also reduce your potential expenses in retirement. You won’t have to make those payments, which can reduce the amount of money you’ll need each month once you’ve stopped working. At the same time, consider your overall lifestyle. If you think you may not have enough for your retirement, are there ways that you can shift your lifestyle over the long run that will reduce expenses? Is there someplace less expensive you could live, for example? This isn’t as simple as skipping your morning latte. Instead, consider whether you can shift your monthly needs in a way that might significantly change your budget both today and in retirement. Consider Working More and Retiring Later If you don’t have enough money to fund additional retirement accounts, consider taking on additional work to earn that money. This can range from freelance or gig work to a formal part-time job. This is not a recommendation we make lightly. By the time you’re in your 50s, the last thing most people will want to do is “hustle.” However, secondary work is a good way to boost your finances, and if you need the money for retirement then it has to come from somewhere. More importantly, while it would be unpleasant to need a second job at 55, it would be far worse to need a job at 75. Working today might help ensure that you don’t have to do so tomorrow. The jump in Social Security payments from normal retirement age to 70 is significant. If you were born between 1943 and 1954, If you start receiving benefits at age 66 you get 100% of your monthly benefit. Should you start receiving retirement benefits at age 67, you’ll get 108% of the monthly benefit because you delayed getting benefits for 12 months. If you start receiving retirement benefits at age 70, you’ll get 132% of the monthly benefit because you delayed getting benefits for 48 months. Bottom Line Most financial experts suggest that retirees should have around five to six times their annual income saved up in their retirement account by age 50. If you haven’t hit that mark, it’s probably a good time to maximize catchup contributions and consider opening one or more additional retirement accounts. In addition, make sure your investments are poised for capital appreciation, which of course entails more risk, and cut your discretionary spending.

4/16/2022,"Jamie Dimon is changing his tune on the chances of a recession hitting, as even America’s biggest banks seem powerless to stop the forces at play. One year ago, almost to the day, the JPMorgan Chase CEO issued a bubbly, confident forecast for the global economy going into 2022 and 2023. In his annual letter to shareholders, Dimon called the confluence of readily available vaccines, high consumer savings, and a likely big increase in public spending a “Goldilocks moment” for the U.S. economy. “It’s a lot of money, and it’s bound to cause a booming economy,” Dimon said last April in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. But even for Dimon, that Goldilocks moment is now beginning to look less and less like a fairy tale. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Dimon said that the ongoing war in Ukraine, high inflation, and the Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance on monetary policy could combine to significantly increase the chances of a recession. “Those are very powerful forces, and those things are going to collide at one point,” he said. “No one knows what’s going to turn out.” Dimon still predicts a relatively strong and growing economy for the rest of 2022, but he said it is difficult to be certain of the future beyond that. The CEO compared the threat of inflation and tight monetary policy to “storm clouds on the horizon that may disappear, they may not.” When asked if a recession was a possibility, Dimon responded: “Absolutely.” Dimon held back from expressing complete certainty that a recession was in the cards, but the change in his forecast is a reminder of how fickle the economic landscape is, and how vulnerable it can be to external geopolitical forces. Dimon joins a number of billionaires, investors, and economists warning about a potential recession, a list that has been steadily growing for weeks. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers recently wrote in a Washington Post op-ed that the current climate is eerily similar to other pre-recession periods, while last week analysts from Bank of America issued a report forecasting an increasingly inevitable “recession shock.” And even if Dimon himself refrained from calling a recession inevitable, his bank appears to be preparing for all eventualities. In its first earnings report of 2022, released on Wednesday, JPMorgan Chase revealed it had set aside $902 million in credit reserves, ​​“largely due to higher probabilities of downside risks.” The larger allotment to credit reserves is part of the reason why Chase’s profits had fallen 42% from a year ago. Last year was an outrageously good one for banking, so a drop is normal, but banks were also hit by unexpected factors including the war in Ukraine, supply-chain issues, and inflation. Dimon reiterated his bleak long-term outlook for the global economy in statements included in the earnings report. “We remain optimistic on the economy, at least for the short term—consumer and business balance sheets as well as consumer spending remain at healthy levels—but see significant geopolitical and economic challenges ahead due to high inflation, supply-chain issues, and the war in Ukraine,” Dimon wrote. JPMorgan Chase’s report kicked off a release of more banking quarterly calls, each posting similar earnings drops. On Thursday, Goldman Sachs announced a 42% drop in profits, while Citigroup’s earnings had fallen by 46%. In its earnings report, Citi announced it is setting aside $1.9 billion in potential loan losses related to the bank’s ties to Russia and “broader impact of the conflict in Ukraine on the macroeconomic environment.” This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Business/Fortune•yesterday,JPMorgan CEO warns of ‘powerful forces’ threatening U.S. economy into a recession,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jpmorgan-ceo-warns-powerful-forces-164626735.html

4/16/2022,"(Reuters) -President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Moscow would work to redirect its energy exports eastward as Europe tries to reduce its reliance on them, adding that European nations would not be able to ditch Russian gas immediately. Russia supplies around 40% of the EU's natural gas, and western sanctions over what Moscow calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine have hit its energy exports by complicating the financing and logistics of existing deals. While the EU debates whether to slap sanctions on Russian gas and oil and member states seek supplies from elsewhere, the Kremlin has been forging closer ties with China, the world's top energy consumer, and other Asian countries. ""The so-called partners from unfriendly countries concede themselves that they won't be able to make do without Russian energy resources, including without natural gas, for example,"" Putin told a televised government meeting. ""There is no rational replacement (for Russian gas) in Europe now."" Putin also said that Europe, by talking about cutting off energy supplies from Russia, was driving up prices and destabilising the market. He said Russia, which accounts for around a tenth of global oil production and around a fifth of gas, would need new infrastructure to boost energy supplies to Asia. He ordered the government to present a plan by June 1 including on ""expanding transport infrastructure to countries of Africa, Latin America (and the) Asia Pacific."" He also sought clarity on the possibility of including two pipelines - China-bound Power of Siberia and the far-eastern Sakhalin-Khabarovsk-Vladivostok in Russian unified system of gas supplies. Plugging those routes into the wider network may allow Russia, in theory, to switch gas flows from Europe to Asia and visa versa. Russia launched pipeline gas supplies to China in the end of 2019 and in February agreed a 30-year contract via a new pipeline, yet to be built, with plans to settle sales in euros. Putin also said that the role of national currencies in exporting deals should rise, amid Russia's plans to switch to roubles in payments for its gas supplies, mainly to Europe. Russia has seen a steep decline in production of oil, its key source of revenues, amid difficulties with payments for trading and vessels. Major global trading houses are planning to reduce crude and fuel purchases from Russia's state-controlled oil companies as early as May 15, sources said, to avoid falling foul of EU sanctions on Russia. Putin said the sector's most acute problems were related to the disruption of energy supply logistics.

4/16/2022,"One of the sweetest deals going for individual savers – a government-backed, inflation-protected bond -- is about to get sweeter. But already, there are signs the party won’t last forever. Next month, the Treasury Department will reset the rate for its I Bonds. Since their rate is tied to the government inflation index which just came in at 8.5%, analysts say I Bonds are likely to rise to about 9.6% for the next six months, up from the current 7.12%. That’s at a time when the interest on many banks’ checking or short-term savings accounts is unlikely to pass 2%. “Given the current environment of rising rates and inflation, investors are looking to I Bonds to earn significantly more returns on their savings over time,” said Mychal Campos, head of investing at digital investment advisor Betterment. “If you purchase an I Bond in April, you're essentially locking in 7.12% annualized return over the next six months and then another 9.6% of annualized returns in the six months after. So that's a very favorable outcome for the growth of your savings,"" he said. But even though savers are protected from downsides in several ways, they face the prospect that inflation may fall as gasoline prices taper off. If that happens, I Bond rates will fall. I Bonds are a variety of government savings bond. Since they are sold direct to the public at treasurydirect.gov, not through brokerages, they generally don’t attract much attention. Plus, individuals are limited to $10,000 in purchases of I Bonds a year. But as inflation has spiked, the investment has taken on a new luster. Starting next month, the deal that’s already good may only get better. Experts say I Bonds are worth a look. “This is a no-brainer for everyone,” said Ken Tumin, senior industry analyst at LendingTree and founder of LendingTree’s rate tracker Deposit Accounts. He believes the rate will hit 9.62% based on Treasury's formula. He is quick, however, to add an exception: Investors who are just starting to build an emergency fund should not sink all their savings into the I Bond because it can’t be redeemed for the first year. After that, there is a withdrawal penalty of three months of interest for the first five years. “That 3-month penalty isn’t much, but not being able to access your money for 12 months could be an issue if all or most of your emergency fund money is in there,” Tumin said. Remember, too, that the I Bond’s rate will continue to fluctuate based on inflation. It has been as low as 0% for six months in 2015 -- it can't dip below 0% so investors can never lose any of their principal -- but it has gone as high as 10.85% for those who bought I bonds in 2000 and held them ever since. They were created in 1998. ►Closer look: High-ethanol E15 gasoline is cheaper, but is it safe for your car? Some economists forecast inflation rates to fall from their current 40-year high, which would cause future I Bond rates to drop. Much of the inflation announced Tuesday is being blamed on record gasoline prices, which rose more than 18% in March. But fuel prices are since starting to ease with President Joe Biden pledging to tap the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve to add to the nation’s oil supply. Used car prices are down a bit, too, though they remained 35% higher in March than the year before.
