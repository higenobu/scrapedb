12/15/2021,"CHICAGO (AP) — The only Black juror on the panel that convicted Jussie Smollett of lying to Chicago police said he couldn't get past what the actor did not do after he claimed attackers looped a noose around his neck: Rip it off and keep it off. If others saw the noose as Smollett's clumsy effort to portray his attackers as racist, Andre Hope saw much more. “As an African American person, I'm not putting that noose back on at all, "" Andre Hope told WLS-TV. At trial, Smollett testified that after the attack in downtown Chicago in January 2019, he returned home and put the rope back around his neck so police who came to his apartment soon after could see it. Hope was not the only Black person who struggled with Smollett's use of such a potent symbol of racism in the U.S. to convince authorities he was the victim of a hate crime. In an interview with NewsNation Now after Smollett was found guilty last Thursday, Eddie Johnson — who was Chicago police superintendent in January 2019 when Smollett said he was attacked — said virtually the same thing.  “I was concerned because I don’t think there’s many Black people in America with a noose around their neck and wouldn’t immediately take it off,” Johnson said.  Hope said the evidence against Smollett was overwhelming. At trial, two brothers testified that Smollett recruited them to carry out the fake attack. Hope said the counter narrative put forth by Smollett's attorneys that the pair had actually planned the attack on Smollett did not make sense.  ""When you just use your common sense as what’s there, yeah it just, it didn’t add up,” said Hope a 63-year-old father of two who lives in suburban Bellwood, west of Chicago.  Hope listened to prosecutors argue Smollett staged the hoax because he was angry that the studio where he filmed the television program “Empire” did not take hate mail he received seriously. But after all the evidence was presented, after all the witnesses testified, Hope still has one big question.  “I still have not figured out a motive for why he did, why this had to even happen,” Hope said. “He was a star.” Smollett faces up to three years in prison when he returns to court next year for sentencing. But experts have said it is far more likely that he will be placed on probation and ordered to perform community service.  That would be fine with Hope, who thinks Smollett does not deserve to go to prison. And, he said, he hopes the actor — who testified that he has lost his livelihood — would be given a chance to resume his career. ",U.S./Associated Press,Black juror: Smollett's reaction to noose makes no sense,https://news.yahoo.com/black-juror-smolletts-reaction-noose-173931705.html
12/15/2021,"A referee stabbed in the head multiple times by a pro wrestler during a choreographed stunt gone haywire says he’s a disabled combat veteran whose PTSD was triggered by the shocking episode. Lando Deltoro, who served in the Navy as a hospital corpsman, told The Daily Beast on Tuesday that he went into hypovolemic shock in the ring—extreme blood loss that can cause the body’s organs to suddenly shut down—which a still-woozy Deltoro said set off a panic attack as he was rushed to a Dallas emergency room. “I haven’t seen that much blood since Fallujah,” said Deltoro, who served in the Persian Gulf War and the Iraq War before retiring from the service in 2003. “It was scary.” Deltoro’s injuries, which came at the hands of 39-year-old Devon Nicholson, who is known professionally as the “Blood Hunter” and “Hannibal,” required seven staples and emergency surgery to repair a severed artery in his skull. Deltoro said he was told he lost close to a liter-and-a-half of blood. The gruesome assault occurred in the aftermath of a match in the “Christmas Star Wars” series, an event annually hosted by indie promotion World Class Pro Wrestling. Deltoro, who is going on 50, said he grew up attending Christmas Star Wars in the 1980s with his uncle and parents. But after his wife died in July, he decided to take a break from the wrestling scene. However, when World Class Pro Wrestling asked him to ref the bout last Saturday, he reluctantly said yes. “Because it was an actual paid gig, with Christmas coming up, I needed money for Christmas,” Deltoro explained. “So that’s why I decided to do it. Because mentally, I don’t think I was ready. Emotionally, I don’t think I was ready. But you know, you buck up and you do the job,” adding, “It was kind of full circle for me.” He said he was paid $75 for the night, but asked for an additional $125 after his hospitalization. The agreement Deltoro worked out before the match was that Nicholson “was going to hit me with a spike.” Deltoro would then surreptitiously “blade” himself with a razor, a time-honored pro wrestling move also known as also known as “juicing,” “gigging,” and “getting color.” A proper blading requires three things, according to Deltoro: “Aspirin, preferably a shot of whiskey—to thin your blood—and you also need sweat, to mix in with the blood, to make it look like you’re bleeding profusely. Well, I hadn't worked [yet] at all that night, so I wasn't sweating.” Deltoro said the plan was for him to “go down, blade, and then roll out and just wobble off. I guess I didn’t blade hard enough to his liking.” However, Deltoro claimed he couldn’t find Nicholson prior to showtime. “He was not around, and normally, as a ref, I like to talk to the people I’m working with to get an idea what they want, exactly where they want me, and how we're going to do this,” Deltoro said. In video footage taken on Saturday night, horrified audience members can be seen screaming at the 280-pound Nicholson to stop as blood flows down Deltoro’s head and face. Blaze, Nicholson’s girlfriend who also works as a manager for Great North Wrestling—a Canadian promotion company owned by Nicholson—climbed into the ring and attempted, unsuccessfully, to pull Nicholson away from Deltoro. Another match official, Colby Cowperthwaite, finally grabbed Deltoro’s legs and pulled him to safety. Paramedics were called, who then transported Deltoro to Parkland Hospital. Cowperthwaite took to Reddit after the event to allege that “something was off” with Nicholson that night. “Bloodhunter went totally off the hinges and refused to listen to me,” he wrote. “He tore the other referee up, then hid the weapon he used to do it.” Cowperthwaite said that Nicholson had stumbled and meandered on his way into the ring. The wrestler allegedly fought to keep his balance as he climbed up on the turnbuckles to taunt the crowd. The Tragic End to Wrestling’s First Great ‘Madman’ A day after the incident, World Class Pro Wrestling CEO Jerry Bostic said Nicholson had been banned from the promotion. “World Class, moving forward, will not be associated with Devon Nicholson… in any way, shape, form, or fashion,” he said in a video statement. “I cannot, will not, condone what happened last night. I didn’t see the actual incident. I didn’t see anything until I came out and Lando was laying on the ground and it was one of the most horrifying things I’ve ever seen.” On Monday, Nicholson uploaded a video to YouTube, insisting he’d been the one to end his relationship with World Class Pro Wrestling, not the other way around. After he sent an email to Bostic saying that it would be best for him “to focus on running my own company in Canada for now,” he said Bostic “put out a video two or three hours later claiming they were the one ending it.” “It was actually me,” he repeated, adding later that he thought the World Class Pro Wrestling team were “scumbags” for “trying to say they fired me, when I clearly quit.”    A post shared by Colby Cowperthwaite (@franklinthecow) Nicholson said Deltoro had been hired because he was a “bleeder,” and that Deltoro had not worked any other matches on the card that night. “His sole purpose of why he was hired was to bleed,” Nicholson said. Nicholson said he’d never seen or handled the spike prop before it was handed to him “by someone” in the ring. “Apparently it was the actual spike that was used with Dusty Rhodes and Kevin Sullivan in the eighties,” he said. Nicholson claimed he thought the bottom of his hand had been covering the spike. Deltoro gave “zero indication to me in the ring that he wasn’t just selling, and [was] legitimately hurt. He never said, ‘Stop.’ He never said, ‘No.’” However, Deltoro took issue with Nicholson’s assertion that he could have stopped the attack at any time. “It’s kind of hard to say ‘stop’ or talk when there is the knee of a 300-pound man on your back, jabbing you in the head with a spike and then at the same time he turns around and chokes you and is jabbing you,” he told The Daily Beast. “So as far as me giving no indication that he was hurting me, I couldn’t because I was starting to pass out.” Nicholson called Deltoro after he got out of surgery to apologize, according to Deltoro. “He asked for forgiveness,” said Deltoro, who described himself as a devout Christian. “I forgave him…I don’t want anything bad to happen to the guy. If the man has demons, if the man has problems, I want him to get help. I want him to be more safe in the ring.” Deltoro said his pillow was still “covered in pus and blood” when he woke up on Tuesday. No charges will be filed, said Deltoro, explaining that the police took a report but have already closed the case. In a month’s time, Deltoro will be tested for Hepatitis C, as Nicholson infamously contracted the viral infection during a bloody bout in 2007 with Larry Shreve, or Abdullah the Butcher, a WWE Hall of Famer ironically known for his excessive use of blading. “I am 90 percent sure I don't have it,” Deltoro said. “Because [Nicholson] wasn't bleeding when I was in the ring with him… But at the same time, you know, there's that 10 percent. You want to be absolutely sure.” A GoFundMe campaign to help Deltoro with his medical bills has raised a little more than $4,700 as of Tuesday afternoon. “I was hired to do a job and it went off-script,” Deltoro said. “It went way off-script.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

12/15/2021,"Chloe Girardier says she was denied an initial appointment for her cough due to her age. After five months and seven doctor's visits, she demanded an X-ray and was diagnosed with cancer. Other young women have spoken up about advocating for themselves in the healthcare system. When Chloe Girardier developed a cough in July, she thought it was a cold. But when it persisted, she sought a doctor's appointment. At first, she said, she was denied. ""They kept telling me I wasn't eligible for an urgent appointment because it was just a cough,"" Girardier, a 23-year-old home health worker in the UK said, according to The Sun. They kept asking her if she'd taken a COVID test without considering other possibilities, she said. Eventually, Girardier said, she was given antibiotics, inhalers, and acid reflux tablets, but her symptoms didn't change. They were getting worse: Girardier said she was losing weight, too. After five months and seven doctors appointments with no answers, Girardier said she insisted on a chest X-ray. The scan revealed a 4.25-inch mass in her chest that turned out to be Hodgkin's lymphoma. The rare cancer causes cells in the lymphatic system grow abnormally and sometimes spread. It can cause a persistent cough, unexplained weight loss, and fatigue, among other symptoms, the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society says. Girardier is set to undergo intensive chemotherapy on December 20. ""I can't believe it wasn't looked into further and if I hadn't pushed for the chest X-ray, I may still not have a diagnosis,"" she said. She's speaking out to encourage young people to listen to their bodies. ""It's been dragged on so long because of my age,"" Girardier said. Research has found that women report more severe levels of pain, more frequent pain, and longer periods of pain than men, but are treated for it less aggressively. One 2018 survey found 62% of women have felt dismissed by a male doctor compared to 42 percent of men. When visiting female clinicians, 47% of women feel dismissed and 37% of men do. Those slights can be dangerous. 24-year-old Danielle Soviero was diagnosed with a brain tumor that had hemorrhaged — and yet she says she was sent home and told to live life ""as normal."" Over six months later she experienced a debilitating migraine and a ""strange pressure"" in her head and demanded an MRI. Even after the scan revealed the tumor had doubled in size and hemorrhaged again, the doctor said it couldn't be removed, Soviero said. ""I was angry. I decided that I needed to take matters into my own hands,"" Soviero told Insider. She found a surgeon who removed the tumor, and after months of occupational, physical, and speech therapy, is almost back to her old self. Another young woman, Brittany Scheier, previously told Insider her symptoms were brushed off in the ER as drug- or alcohol-related. She was later diagnosed with a stroke at age 27. Another woman told Insider that her birth-control linked blood clot was also dismissed as alcohol or drugs at age 15. And TikTokers, including one pregnant woman whose stroke was misdiagnosed as dehydration, have encouraged others to speak up for themselves. Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, a cardiologist in New York City, previously told Insider she often hears women say ""I was listening to the doctor. Maybe they're right,'"" she said. ""No one knows our bodies as well as we do. Nobody is living in our bodies. We know when we're not OK.""

12/15/2021,"The decline of American Christianity is continuing apace. The Pew Research Center reports today that the number of self-identified Christians has declined by 12 percentage points since 2012, while religious ""nones"" have grown by 10 points during that time. (Other surveys have shown similar drops.) Christians are still the dominant cultural group in America — at 63 percent of the population, they still have a two-to-one advantage over the non-religious — but they're not quite as dominant as they used to be. The secularization of America is a long-term process and has many causes, and the percentage of Christians has been trending downward since Pew first surveyed the issue in 2007. Moreover, not everything in public life over the last decade has been about former President Donald Trump, even if it sometimes feels that way. Still, Trumpism might be both the beneficiary and accelerant of Christianity's loosening grip on the culture. On the one hand, a 2018 study suggested Trump's victory in 2016 was driven by a cohort — white Christian men — who feared they were losing their cultural dominance: Support for Trump was linked to a belief that ""high status"" groups actually faced more discrimination than ""low status"" groups like minorities and Muslims. ""This sense of ownership of America just runs so deep in white evangelical circles,"" Robert P. Jones of the Public Religion Research Institute told columnist Michelle Goldberg earlier this year. As president, Trump cemented the loyalty of this group by fashioning his administration as a champion of ""religious liberty,"" which was mainly a project to preserve the declining cultural power of conservative Christians. It worked: Some 85 percent of white evangelicals who attend services at least once a month voted for Trump in 2020. Yet Pew's report suggests evangelicals are continuing to lose ground, albeit more slowly than Christianity at large, dropping from 30 percent of the population in 2007 to 24 percent in the new report. (Pew previously reported some conservatives have flocked to evangelical churches in recent years.) But many pastors report their churches have been riven by political conflict as never before, and there's anecdotal evidence that some young people are fleeing their churches rather than be seen as aligning with Trump's toxicity. Some researchers believe the decline in churchgoing is a repudiation of that brand of Republican politics. White evangelicals are not all of American Christianity, of course. Catholics — who evenly split their votes in 2020 — have seen their numbers hold steady in recent years. But you can see where this is going: If Christianity's decline feeds Trumpism, and if Trumpism feeds Christianity's decline, then American churches might be locked in a nasty spiral, with the rest of the country along for the ride.
