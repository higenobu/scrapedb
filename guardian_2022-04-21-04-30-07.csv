4/21/2022,"The UK will “reform” the Northern Ireland Brexit protocol if the EU will not, Jacob Rees-Mogg has warned, raising the possibility of a dramatic intervention after the assembly elections in a fortnight’s time. The Brexit opportunities minister said he could not reveal any more due to the sensitivities of the Stormont election in Northern Ireland, where tensions have flared over the protocol. He told MPs on the EU scrutiny committee that the protocol was written in such a way that it could be “superseded”. “That is really important to understand because a lot of commentary that says: ‘Well, we signed it and therefore surely we should accept it lock, stock and barrel.’ That’s absolute nonsense. “We signed it on the basis that it would be reformed. And there comes a point at which you say: ‘Well, you haven’t reformed it and therefore we are reforming it ourselves.’ And the United Kingdom is much more important than any agreement that we have with any foreign power,” he told MPs. Asked what moves he had in mind in relation to reforms, he said: “I think I oughtn’t say anymore with elections going on,” but added that “the wheels are in motion”. “We can do what we want, ultimately,” the Brexit opportunities minister told MPs in relation to clause 38 (b) in the EU Withdrawal Act 2020 which underlines parliamentary powers in domestic law. His comments come amid rife speculation in Northern Ireland industry circles that the government is planning an “internal market bill 2.0” a reference to the controversial 2020 attempt to unilaterally tear up some of the protocol. That move was abandoned after government claims it would only breach the international Brexit treaty in a “specific and limited” way were denounced by opposition parties and some leading Conservative figures. Rees Mogg was being questioned about reforms to EU retained law and the so called Brexit reforms bill. He revealed that not all the 1,500 EU laws the government wanted to remove or change would be in the bill as a “trade off” to getting it ready in time for the Queen’s speech. But he said some changes would be definitely included, such as streamlining of procurement rules which, pre-Brexit, required public bodies to tender across the EU, and to data protection laws. He also hinted that the UK would not be following a new EU move to put speed limiters on cars as some reports have suggested. “It is not a policy that has received collective agreement,” he said. Rees Mogg’s comments on Northern Ireland comes as the EU and UK continue to negotiate a revised version of the protocol with a deal already agreed and approved to remove barriers blocking the sale of British medicines in NI which observes EU trade rules under the protocol. Sources close to the talks say progress is not expected until after the assembly election with hopes a deal could be done on one of the main sticking points – customs paperwork.",News/Politics,"UK will ‘reform’ Northern Ireland protocol if EU will not, says Rees-Mogg",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/20/brexit-uk-northern-ireland-protocol-jacob-rees-mogg
4/21/2022,"The two finalists in France’s presidential elections are facing off in a live TV debate that could be crucial in persuading wavering voters - particularly on the left - four days before the decisive second round vote. This article will be updated regularly with key exchanges and reaction as the debate progresses Asked to open the debate by stating what kind of president she would be, Marine Le Pen says she would be “a president of daily life, of the value of work … A president of national fraternity, uniting the national around a collective project. Another choice is possible,” she says. Macron says he has traversed a “difficult time” with the countrty, a time when “fears, concerns are there”. He aims to continue to do so because “I believe that we can make our country more independent, and stronger”. Cost of living crisis: Le Pen says seven out of 10 people feel their purchasing power has fallen over the past five years. She says she will cut taxes, reward hard work, and help those who are vulnerable. I will “give the French their money back”, she says, to the tune of €150-200 per month per household. Macron says purchasing power has risen under his presidency but admits “life is becoming more expensive”. He says it is more effective to cap prices than to cut taxes, and notes that Le Pen voted against price caps in parliament. He also notes that Le Pen’s promise to raise salaries by 10% is not in her gift: “It is employers who decide that.” Macron adds that his government’s measures have kept inflation significantly lower in France than in its EU neighbours.",News/World news,Macron-Le Pen debate: key moments in the French election head-to-head,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/20/macron-le-pen-debate-key-moments-in-the-french-election-head-to-head
4/21/2022,"Home Office staff have threatened to strike and drawn comparisons to working for the Third Reich over Priti Patel’s plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda, it has emerged. Comments on an internal online noticeboard include calls for industrial action to stop the policy and concern from a staff member of 20 years who feels “deep shame” and is considering their position. One anonymous civil servant drew a comparison to serving under Adolf Hitler. In a reference to the post-second world war Nazi trials at Nuremberg, they wrote: “The words ‘I was only obeying orders’ are echoing down through history to me and making me queasy.” They were later chastised by a colleague for making “absurd comparisons”. It comes as a Conservative MP challenged the government’s plan to build a processing centre for asylum seekers in a small North Yorkshire village. The internal comments, first disclosed by Mail+, reveal that dozens of staff have voiced their opposition to the agreement with Rwanda, which was signed off by the home secretary this week and has been applauded by Boris Johnson. One Home Office staff member asked whether staff would have a duty to campaign against the policy. “Do we have a responsibility to not just leave, but to organise and resist? We cannot simply wash our hands and walk away,” they wrote. Another asked: “I find the government proposal totally unethical and it impacts directly upon my workstream. As a civil servant can I refuse this type of work in contravention of my own ethics?” Another said: “I’ve worked for the Home Office for 20 years. There’s been some ups and downs in that time. But this announcement has made me feel deep shame and is the first time I am considering my position here and whether I need to get out of this department.” Another stated: “Can the permanent secretary and seniors give staff any advice on coping with our conscience with these sort of policies? I don’t feel safe telling people I work for the Home Office any more and now just make up a nondescript role in another government department when asked what I do for a job.” The report has been confirmed as accurate by a Home Office source. The comments will be put to the Home Office permanent secretary, Matthew Rycroft, during an online group call for staff on Thursday. In a further development, the local Tory MP has challenged plans for a new centre at the former RAF base Linton-on-Ouse, announced as part of the government’s new migration measures. Kevin Hollinrake, representing Thirsk and Malton, initially suggested he was sympathetic to the plans. But on Wednesday, after meeting Patel, he called for the proposal to be reversed and threatened to support a judicial review if it is not. “The current proposal of 1,500 young men in an an open camp in the heart of a small rural village is not workable, sustainable or acceptable,” wrote Hollinrake in a letter to the home secretary. “It simply cannot be that availability of a site dictates the appropriateness of the location,” he said. Some Conservative MPs raised concerns over the Rwanda policy on Wednesday as they debated the government motion to disagree with Lords’ amendments to the nationality and borders bill. Simon Hoare, the MP for North Dorset, said: “A safe route clearly would kill the evil traffic of people smuggling at a stroke. That’s one way of dealing with it. “I fail to see how moving people to Rwanda is going to in any way disrupt this money-making scheme which these people traffickers have. They’re just going to use different routes to land people on our shores. I’m just not getting it, I’m afraid.” The Conservative former minister Sir Bob Neill suggested using the £120m paid initially to the Rwandan government to improve the UK’s system for handling claims. “Can I make the point that the salary of an immigration tribunal judge, first tier tribunal judge, is £117,000. If you put on on costs, even most generously, that’s about £200,000. “Look at the £120m so far committed to the Rwanda scheme; there’s about 600 first tier tribunal judges could be bought for that, or any number of hundreds of Home Office case workers. Would that not be an alternative, actually to invest in the current system? ... That would be a constructive alternative, surely,” he said. Tom Pursglove, the the junior migration minister, replied: “That of itself will not solve this issue and I genuinely believe that the approach that we are taking through the comprehensive plan will shift the dial, will change the dynamic and will ultimately help us to shut down these evil criminal networks.” The Home Office was approached for a comment.",News/UK news,Home Office staff threaten mutiny over ‘shameful’ Rwanda asylum deal,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/20/home-office-staff-threaten-mutiny-over-shameful-rwanda-asylum-deal
4/21/2022,"Spoiler alert: this article is for people watching Moon Knight on Disney+. Do not read unless you have seen episodes one to four. Considering my role here as the writer of this Moon Knight recap, I know I am supposed to be the one offering insight, explaining plot developments, searching for clues and positing the odd theory, so I understand it’s not that helpful when I kick things off by asking: “What on Earth was that about”? But really, what on Earth was all that about? I was merrily watching Oscar Isaac playing second fiddle to May Calamawy in his own show and thinking about how, even though the series wasn’t going in the direction I thought it would, I was still really enjoying it. It seems like a very long time ago that we saw Moon Knight fighting rampaging hellhounds on the streets of London – or Moon Knight at all come to think of it – but the Tomb Raider/Uncharted adaptation of the opening 35 minutes of this episode were a blast, and certainly better than Tom Holland’s actual Uncharted adaptation. And then BAM. Just as I didn’t see Marc’s bullets in the chest coming, I wasn’t expecting things to go all One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, either. They were all there, in the “psychiatric hospital” – and I’m using quote marks as I don’t believe it’s really a hospital … Bek the henchman, Crawley the living statue without his makeup, annoying Donna and the fake police officers Billy and Bobbi. The whole gang. Then Harrow showed up as the doctor. Thankfully, Marc smelled a rat, even in his heavily sedated state, seeing one too many details in the room for it to be coincidence – the cane, the Egyptian artefacts, the drawing of Khonshu, the repeated line about not being able to help him, those awful sandals – and made a dash for it. At this point, the hospital being a construct, a trick played by Harrow, seemed certain. When Marc smashed that window, I was fully expecting the desert to be on the other side of the door, reminiscent of the scene in The First Avenger when Captain America realised he wasn’t in the 1940s and escaped into modern-day New York. But no, the illusion, if it is an illusion, runs deeper than that. This episode, The Tomb, asked more questions than it answered. How can Marc and Steven meet when they share a body? How can Taweret, the Egyptian goddess most closely associated with fertility, childbirth and rejuvenation, be there? Judging by the hippo’s cheery greeting, she’s happy to see Marc and Steven, and has possibly even seen them before, or knows who they are, but, given the way the episode cut to black with them screaming, they were just as confused as us viewers. Of course, it could be that everything we’ve seen in the three-and-a-bit episodes leading up to this point happened only in Marc’s head, but that seems the least likely explanation. Prior to all this, we got nearer the truth about Layla’s father, although there is still more to come on that front. We know that Abdullah was an “archaeologist on a mission”, and was working with a team in the desert when Marc’s partner got greedy and killed them all. All plausible, but who was Marc’s bloodthirsty partner? Is it going to be another person – and if that is the case, I don’t believe it’s a character we have already met. More likely, it’s the so-far-hinted-at maniacal third personality we may have caught a glimpse of in Cairo in episode three. Overall, I thought it was the strongest episode of the series so far. The danger with introducing a character like Moon Knight, with no obvious ties to the MCU, is that it feels rootless, given that one of the biggest draws to Marvel films and TV series is the connectivity. Now, four episodes in, while we’re still adrift, but we’ve learned enough about Marc, Steven, Layla and Harrow to feel invested. I didn’t miss Moon Knight or Khonshu in this episode, although I might start asking questions if their absence goes on much longer. With two episodes to go, I’m still not sure what the end point will be, but I’m going to stick around to find out – and not just because I am writing these recaps and it’s my job to do so. The actor playing Dr Steven Grant in Tomb Busters was Joseph Millson, best known for long stints in Peak Practice and Holby City. He was also Alan Jackson in The Sarah Jane Adventures. Jeff Lemire’s 2016 Moon Knight comic run had a storyline where Marc woke up in a psychiatric hospital only to be told that he’d been there for years and that he wasn’t Moon Knight. The hospital later transpired to be a fake and that Ammit, in disguise, was one of Marc’s doctors. Could that be what’s going on here? Who or what was in the third sarcophagus in the hospital? Taweret has never appeared in any Moon Knight or Marvel property before, making this her debut across all formats. The scene where Layla and Harrow speak about her father was written in because Calamawy and Ethan Hawke wanted to spend more time on screen together. Hawke apparently went away after shooting one day and had the whole conversation mapped out by the following morning. The location of Alexander the Great’s tomb is an enduring mystery, with more than 140 official attempts to find it. In 2021, Egyptian officials claimed they had found it in Siwa, near the Libyan border. What did you think? Is the institution in Marc’s head, or a trick played by Harrow? Will Khonshu be freed and give Marc back his powers?

4/21/2022,"The former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he hoped military alliances like Nato could be ultimately disbanded, saying they could create “greater danger” in the world. In comments that are likely to inflame further tensions with Labour HQ, Corbyn said he did not blame Nato for the Russian invasion of Ukraine but that it had to be looked at in historical context. Corbyn is currently suspended from holding the Labour whip after comments made in the wake of the Equality and Human Rights Commission report into antisemitism in the party under his leadership. The Islington North MP said that people should “look at the process that could happen at the end of the Ukraine war” and questioned: “Do military alliances bring peace?” “I would want to see a world where we start to ultimately disband all military alliances,” he told Times Radio. “The issue has to be: what’s the best way of bringing about peace in the future? Is it by more alliances? Is it by more military buildup? “Or is it by stopping the war in Ukraine and the other wars … that are going on at the present time, which are also killing a very large number of people? And ask yourself the question: do military alliances bring peace? Or do they actually encourage each other and build up to a greater danger? “I don’t blame Nato for the fact that Russia has invaded Ukraine. What I say is look at the thing historically, and look at the process that could happen at the end of the Ukraine war.” The former leader said he would be “supporting Ukraine’s right to defend itself” if he was PM but would be focused on encouraging dialogue. Asked whether he backed Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, he said: “I’ve never met him. I don’t know … I think he speaks well and I admire that.” Corbyn said the decision not to readmit him as a Labour MP was a “wrong, totally unjustified decision” by Labour leader Keir Starmer. Starmer told the Guardian last week that further comments by Corbyn, including his support for the Stop the War Coalition, had made his readmittance more difficult, saying he expected all Labour MPs to be supportive of Nato and not to draw “false equivalence” between Russia and Nato. Those comments led to a swift rebuttal from the former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, who said it was absurd to suggest there had not been commitment to Nato under Corbyn’s leadership. “A commitment to Nato has been Labour policy democratically determined by party conference and accepted by every Labour leader for inclusion in every Labour manifesto, including by Jeremy Corbyn, since Nato’s inception,” he tweeted. “If we can’t be honest in our assessments of Nato’s performance, lessons for how it performs its role in the future will never be learnt. On this basis I see no reason why Jeremy Corbyn doesn’t meet these new conditions for entitlement to the Labour whip.”",News/Politics,Jeremy Corbyn would like to see Nato ‘ultimately disband’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/20/jeremy-corbyn-would-like-to-see-nato-ultimately-disband

A murder investigation has been launched after the bodies of a man and woman in their 60s and another man in his 50s were discovered in Spring Gardens, Bourne End on Tuesday evening. All three victims were understood to be known to each other. Officers from Thames Valley Police were called to reports of a disturbance at the property shortly before 9.55pm. A spokesman said the evidence suggested a “serious assault” had occurred. Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the killings. Senior investigating officer DS Kevin Brown, of the major crime unit, said: “The next of kin have been informed and are being supported by specially trained officers, our thoughts remain with them at this most difficult time. “We are in the very early stages of this investigation and we are dealing with a very complex inquiry, which appears a targeted attack. We are not looking for anyone else in connection with it. “We would ask anyone who may have heard a disturbance or who may have seen anyone or anything unusual in or around Orchard House or Spring Gardens between 5pm and 10pm yesterday to please come forward and call 101, quoting reference 2037 of 19/4/2022.” He added that a crime scene would remain in place for a number of days and that the public would see an increased police presence in the area.

4/21/2022,"Johnny Depp’s courtroom exploration of his life and marriage with Amber Heard continued in the US on Wednesday, with the actor recounting how his deteriorating marriage mirrored his relationship with his mother. Depp recalled how Heard subjected him to an “endless parade of insults”, how he had “wanted to try to make it work, to help her. The Amber Heard I knew was not this opponent. She wasn’t my girl, she’d become my opponent.” Frequently the focus of their conflict, he said, was his drinking. “She’d been pretty brutish about telling me I needed to stop drinking,” Depp said, telling the actor he was “weak, a complete mess, an alcoholic ruining everything”. Depp said the exchanges frequently escalated into full-scale arguments. “Her need for conflict and violence erupts out of nowhere,” he said. “I learned to deal with it exactly as I did as a child, which was retreat.” A strategy of placation only seemed to inflame his partner, Depp said, though he persisted with it because “placation seemed the best route if I was unable to escape her clutches”. The court in Fairfax, Virginia, has yet to hear Heard’s version of events but over a day and a half of Depp’s testimony so far, jurors have been given a tour of an unstable celebrity marriage colored by addiction. Depp is suing Heard for $50m, accusing her of defamation after she alleged violent domestic abuse. At issue throughout much of their marriage, Depp said, was Heard’s anger at his inability to stop using substances. At one point, he convinced Heard to stay at a bungalow at the Beverly Hills hotel while he attempted to come off Roxicodone, a brand of potent prescription opioid painkillers, under the care of his doctor, David Kipper. “You won’t have to sit around ‘Mr Shakey’,” he told the jury he had said to his wife. He continued in his second day of testimony: “She wasn’t happy with it but she did eventually leave. So for a few days I sat around in a metal chair with one song on a loop so I could focus on the lyrics and the power of the song to help me get through it.” On another, after returning from Boston where he had been filming the movie Black Mass in May 2014, Depp said he paid for Heard and her friends to stay at the Chateau Marmont hotel in Los Angeles, while he again attempted to kick his habit. He had not been drinking to excess on the plane, where Heard alleges that an assault took place, but had taken two painkillers and locked himself in the bathroom to avoid her badgering, he said. “If I had [been drunk], I’d have been hugging the porcelain,” he said, a reference to vomiting. Depp said that Heard had become enraged when he had started drinking in Australia during the filming of one of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise films and had thrown a bottle of vodka at him, severing the top of his finger. Depp testified that he had suggested Heard also stop drinking and taking drugs, which Depp has itemized as wine, ecstasy, mushrooms, and “a high-velocity speed”. He told the court: “I said, ‘How about this? You stop drinking, stop drinking to help me through this.’ She said no, she didn’t have a problem.” Depp’s testimony has sometimes appeared to tend towards the simplistic, such as when the actor said he “was doing anything I could bring a smile to her face, as opposed to a frown”. “I tried to bring her mood up. I wanted to try. Not understanding fully what I was up against, I kept trying, but to no avail whatsoever,” he said. Through this extended life story, Depp has weaved in aspects of his history with other women. Heard has said that the first time she was assaulted was when Depp slapped her in 2013 after she mocked a tattoo that had once said “Winona Forever” – a reference to the actor and former girlfriend Winona Ryder – but had since been changed to “Wino Forever”. “It didn’t happen,” he said of the alleged assault. “Why would I take such great offense to someone making fun of a tattoo on my body? That allegation never made any sense to me.” Heard, he suggested was jealous that Depp had not had himself inscribed with her name. Despite the difficulties in their brief marriage, Depp maintains that he never assaulted Heard, the allegation that goes to the heart of the defamation he claims she made in a 2018 Washington Post column. On Wednesday, he repeated that denial saying that his disputes with Heard would never cause him to hit her. “Violence isn’t necessary,” Depp said. “Why would you hit someone to make them agree with you?

4/21/2022,"The UK, US and Canada have staged a coordinated walkout of a G20 meeting in protest against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, amid growing risks of division between leading nations hitting the world economy. Representatives from the three countries left the session as Russian delegates spoke at the meeting in Washington. Sources said the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, and a senior Treasury official were among those to leave the talks. The walkout at the session, which was taking place on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings, came amid growing fears that a breakdown in international relations would severely undermine the global economy’s recovery from the pandemic and add to soaring inflation, pushing millions more people into poverty worldwide. In comments made shortly before the protest, the head of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, warned 75 years of development gains were being put at risk by a splintering of international cooperation. Asked about reports of a potential walkout at the G20 meeting, Georgieva said the world had reached a “watershed moment” for global partnerships to tackle a range of issues including the pandemic, war in Ukraine, the climate emergency and rising poverty. “There are clearly very, very unsettling facts we have to deal with. I can say honestly I never thought that I would live through another war in Europe on the scale this one takes place,”she said. “We also recognise how interdependent we are. Just make the list of questions – no country can solve [them] on its own. It is so obvious that cooperation must and will continue.” The walkout came as western leaders challenged Russia’s membership of the G20 group of leading economies, which includes the US, UK, France and Germany, as well as powerful developing countries including China, Brazil and India. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, tweeted that UK representatives had walked out of the meeting. “We are united in our condemnation of Russia’s war against Ukraine and will push for stronger international coordination to punish Russia,” he said. Sources said the UK, US and other western nations were pushing for a consensus position on Russia’s continued membership of the G20 and had questioned the attendance of Kremlin representatives. The US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, told attendees she disapproved of a senior Russian official’s presence, according to Reuters. The US Treasury said earlier on Wednesday that Yellen met with Sri Mulyani Indrawati, the finance minister of Indonesia – which currently holds the rotating presidency of the G20 – to emphasise that there would “be no business-as-usual for Russia in the global economy”. Mohamed El-Erian, a former deputy director of the IMF who is now president of Queens’ College, Cambridge, said the flare-up showed the G20 was not functioning as an international body. “The future of multilateralism is at risk at a time when we need it most,” El-Erian said as he called on governments to continue to work together through alternative means. “The G20 is too divided, and lacks continuity. Its always been a puzzle to me why it doesn’t have a secretariat. You go through presidency by presidency it changes every time. So very little gets done,” he said. “The one exception was the April 2009 London summit under Gordon Brown, that was the one exception. The G7 is too narrow in terms of membership. In terms of your existing tools it is a reformed and revamped IMF and World Bank.” The IMF said on Tuesday that risks to the global economy were growing as Russia’s war in Ukraine drove up inflation. The Washington-based fund said the war had increased the risk of a more permanent fragmentation of the global economy into geopolitical blocs. Such a “tectonic shift” would entail high adjustment costs for the global economy, it said.",News/World news,"US, UK and Canada walk out of G20 meeting over war in Ukraine",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/20/us-uk-and-canada-walk-out-g20-meeting-war-in-ukraine-russia
