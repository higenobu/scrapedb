2/27/2022,"Boris Johnson has said there are some “very grim days ahead for Ukraine”. Speaking at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire on Saturday night, the prime minister said he had “just come off the phone” to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. “Let’s be in no doubt, things are not going all the way of President Putin, very far from it,” he said. “The Ukrainians are fighting heroically, and in some places with great success, as many of us thought they would because they’re a great country and a very brave country. “But as you rightly point out, there are some terrible atrocities being committed and there will be some very grim days ahead for Ukraine. We’ve got to do everything we can to change the heavy odds that Ukraine faces and to help them, and so that’s why we’re sending humanitarian supplies, we’re sending financial supplies and military supplies as well.” Johnson also said there was growing support to ban Russia from the Swift banking system. Shortly after his statement it was announced that the UK, EU, US and Canada would remove “selected Russian banks” from Swift. At the Oxfordshire airbase, he said: “You ask: ‘should we do more?’ The answer is yes. And we need to make sure that we apply those much tougher economic sanctions, including Swift, and what’s starting to happen is that the horror of what is unfolding in Ukraine is becoming clear to western audiences, and that is, in turn, putting huge pressure on western politicians. “We’ve got to act together and we’ve got to do more.” He added: “Swift is the mechanism that stops people making payments to Vladimir Putin’s Russia. It’s incredibly important for tightening the ligature, the economic ligature around the Putin regime.” Johnson said that Vladimir Putin’s engagement in diplomacy had been a “charade”. “I think we have to face the hideous reality that the diplomacy, as far as President Putin was concerned, was a charade,” he said. “He never really intended to alter his course. You read the article that he wrote many months ago – it was clear that he’s attached to a weird, semi-mystical view of Ukraine as part of Russia. “And that is a view that the Ukrainian people fervently, passionately reject and they’re showing that they will fight to reject it. Our job now is to help them, to help change the very heavy odds they face and that’s why we’re sending the support that we are.” When pushed on whether the UK would take refugees fleeing from the conflict Johnson insisted: “Of course we’re going to take refugees … The UK is way out in front in our willingness to help with refugees. We’ve sent 1,000 troops to the theatre, to be ready to help with the influx and, of course, we will help people fleeing in fear of their lives.” When asked if there was frustration at countries such as China abstaining rather than voting to condemn Russia’s illegal invasion at the UN security council, Johnson said there was a growing sense of “disgust” at the actions of Russia. “I think what you’re seeing today and over the last few hours is a sense around the world that this is a horror that they simply hadn’t expected,” he said. “And I think that feeling is strong and growing not just in countries in the middle ground, but in Russia itself.” With regard to whether the UK should break off sporting connections with Russia following Poland and Sweden’s refusal to play the national football team in the World Cup play-offs, Johnson added: “It’s a sad thing because I don’t think we’ve had a situation like this for a very, very long time, but it’s inconceivable to me to imagine that normal sporting relations with Putin’s Russia can continue.”",News/World news,Boris Johnson warns of ‘very grim days ahead for Ukraine’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/26/boris-johnson-warns-of-very-grim-days-ahead-for-ukraine
2/27/2022,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has amplified pressure for tougher economic sanctions on Moscow. On Saturday night the US, Canada, UK, and Germany, have agreed to remove “selected Russian banks” from Swift – the world’s main international payments network – with the aim of hitting Russian trade and making it harder for its companies to do business. Swift (the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) is the main secure messaging system that banks use to make rapid and secure cross-border payments, allowing international trade to flow smoothly. It has become the principal mechanism for financing international trade. In 2020, about 38 million transactions were sent each day over the Swift platform, facilitating trillions of dollars’ worth of deals. Swift, founded in the 1970s, is a cooperative of thousands of member institutions that use the service. Based in Belgium, it remains neutral in trade disputes, being run principally as a service to its members. Run-of-the-mill transactions would need to be conducted directly between banks, or routed through fledgling rival systems, adding to costs and creating delays. One reason was that the impact on Russian businesses might not be so serious. The head of a large Russian bank, VTB, said recently he could use other channels for payments, such as phones, messaging apps or email. Russian banks could also route payments via countries that have not imposed sanctions, such as China, which has set up its own payments system to rival Swift. A ban on Russia using Swift could accelerate a the use of China’s rival Cips system. There is also a fear that it could damage the US dollar’s status as the global reserve currency, and accelerate the use of alternatives such as cryptocurrencies. The Biden administration was concerned that a ban could harm its allies as much as it did Russian firms. Russia is a big buyer of foreign manufactured goods, especially from the Netherlands and Germany. Russia is the main EU supplier of crude oil, natural gas and solid fossil fuels, and European countries could find it harder to find replacement suppliers. However, the EU has now also got behind the ban. In the past, Swift has resisted calls to impose bans on certain countries, describing itself as neutral. But in 2012, the European Union barred Swift from serving Iranian firms and individuals sanctioned in relation to Tehran’s nuclear programme, setting a precedent for action against Russia. A Swift spokesperson declined to say how the organisation would respond to any US sanctions, Reuters said.",News/Technology,What is Swift and what will shutting Russia out of it achieve?,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/24/what-is-swift-international-payments-network-russia-sanction
2/27/2022,"Fabinho has said it would be even more special for Liverpool if they win the Carabao Cup against Chelsea on Sunday because they were denied the chance to celebrate with their supporters when they became Premier League champions. The Brazilian was part of the team which ended Liverpool’s 30-year wait for a 19th league title in 2020 but, with fans banned from grounds because of coronavirus restrictions, Jordan Henderson lifted the trophy in an empty Anfield. While they won the Champions League in 2019 and then the European Super Cup and the Club World Cup the following season, all were abroad and in front of fewer supporters so Sunday’s game offers the chance for more fans to see them secure silverware. Liverpool have been allocated 32,999 tickets and Fabinho insists the presence of a crowd gives him extra motivation. “When we won the Premier League it was in Covid times so we couldn’t celebrate in the right way with our fans, so to have them in the stadium will be special,” the midfielder said. “It will be 50-50 between the supporters, hopefully the red part will be really beautiful. We know our fans will be behind us. Everything would make this final special: we play at Wembley and our fans are behind us. It will be really nice to win this title. It would be my first national cup with Liverpool.” Trent Alexander-Arnold has said that Liverpool should aim to lift at least one honour every year and Henderson said: “It will be another big moment for us as a team to win a trophy this season. Hopefully at the end of the day we can celebrate with our fans.” The Liverpool captain, the one survivor of their last League Cup-winning team a decade ago, believes they can use victory on Sunday as the springboard to further success in their pursuit of a historic quadruple. Henderson feels they are picking up a head of steam as they improve and feels securing the season’s first silverware would increase their morale for their challenge on three other fronts. Liverpool have won their past nine games in all competitions to revive their Premier League title hopes, reached the FA Cup fifth round and take a 2-0 lead from the opening away leg of their Champions League last-16 tie with Internazionale. Henderson said: “As this season has gone on, we have got stronger and stronger and as we are getting to the business end, I hope we can continue, starting with a huge game for us. If we do that, then we will have a good chance of winning and if you win trophies this early in the season, it can give you a big boost.” This competition has often been a catalyst for clubs to earn more honours. In Pep Guardiola’s reign, Manchester City have won the Carabao Cup and then the Premier League three times in the same campaign, while in each of his spells at Chelsea, José Mourinho did the double of the Carling Cup, as it then was, and the title. When Liverpool won four consecutive League Cups in the 1980s, they either went on to claim the old Division One, the European Cup or both on each occasion. However, Henderson is aware that Chelsea are following in Liverpool’s footsteps by using Champions League glory as a platform to further honours. “Chelsea have won a few trophies over the past year so they are in a very good moment,” he said. “We know ourselves when you win one trophy, you keep going and keep going and you have got momentum and pick up one or two more. They seem to have done that after the Champions League but it is our job to stop that and make sure we are the ones going home with the trophy.” Liverpool went seven years without silverware after their 2012 League Cup triumph against Cardiff on penalties. The 2019 Champions League was the first of four prizes but Henderson said he retains his hunger to claim more. “You should be challenging for trophies year in, year out: that’s the expectancy at Liverpool Football Club, that doesn’t change. “We’ve won one or two things over the past few years but you always want more, you always want the next one, you always want to improve as a team. “I feel as though we have done that but you’ve got to get over the line in finals and you’ve got to win big trophies and have big moments. Hopefully, there’s another big moment for us.”",Sport/Football,Fabinho yearns to celebrate a Carabao Cup success with Liverpool fans,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/26/fabinho-carabao-cup-final-liverpool-fans
