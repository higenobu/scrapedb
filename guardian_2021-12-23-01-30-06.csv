12/23/2021,"When Ryan King was called about reports of a saw-scaled viper found in a brickyard he was doubtful. They are among the world’s deadliest snakes and they don’t tend to live in Salford. The RSPCA inspector, however, quickly realised he was wrong. It was indeed a saw-scaled viper, and it had apparently survived a 4,000-mile trip from Pakistan in a shipment of bricks.  “I was a bit sceptical,” King said. “Sometimes we go to jobs like this and it turns out to be a harmless grass snake. We have even attended snake reports which turn out to be plastic toys.” A forklift truck driver at Manchester Brick Specialists in Salford spotted the viper last Friday in a container of bricks that had come in about a month ago. Workers researched what it could be and concluded it looked like a saw-scaled viper, but were unaware of how dangerous it could be. The firm’s logistics manager, Michael Regan, put a cardboard box over it and called the RSPCA. “I knew to keep a safe distance but obviously had no idea how deadly this snake was,” he said, recalling the moment he was told. “It was pretty shocking.” Saw-scaled vipers are quite small but have a venomous bite. In India, where around half of the world’s snake-bite deaths are thought to take place, they are feared for their high-speed strikes. There are four species which together account for the highest number of human fatalities. King said he quickly realised it was a dangerous snake when he saw it. In full protective clothing he was able to pop it in a snake bag and transport it to a new home, an establishment licensed to care for venomous reptiles. “I just think it was so lucky that they had spotted the snake,” he said. “They are very small and it could have easily bitten someone. “Anti-venom is available in the countries where the viper originates from, but the snake is so venomous even then it does not always save the victim. “It was quite an honour to deal with this snake and I am pleased he has a home where he will be looked after. The RSPCA recommends that anyone who sees a stray exotic snake should keep a safe distance and call its helpline on 0300 1234 999.",News/UK news,Forklift driver finds deadly saw-scaled viper in Salford brickyard,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/22/forklift-driver-finds-deadly-saw-scaled-viper-in-salford-brickyard
12/23/2021,"As we hurtle towards the end of the year, it’s always a time for reflection. Getting through the festive period will be a challenge: after a couple of hours of chatting at a dinner party recently I had to go and lie down to rest, to switch my body and brain off and allow them to recharge. It’s an improvement from last year, when I wouldn’t have got there to begin with, let alone managed a glass of fizz and engaged in conversation. I caught Covid in March 2020, and was by definition a “mild” case: not admitted to hospital and no risk factors for severe disease, but how it has affected and my family is anything but mild. Having been fit and active, I now find that on bad days I still struggle with everyday chores, and my usually quick-firing brain remains in slo-mo (“brain fog”), a far cry from the way it used to function when I was still working as a consultant in infectious diseases. Days become a hierarchy of lists: on bad days I have to prioritise only that which is essential, and on good days I have to be careful not to overdo it. Pacing has become vital, and the joy of spontaneity has been vanquished. Everything has to be planned, to allow for time and rest between each activity, be it physical or mental. As I write this, I am aware I am not following that mantra, and there will probably be payback tomorrow.  For many months, it has felt as though long Covid has not been on the political agenda, but many people are still struggling with their everyday lives, and struggling to get the help they need. Why is long Covid not included in the daily statistics, or as one of the main incentives to avoid Omicron, and to get a vaccine and booster jab? It’s never mentioned, and it often feels as if sufferers don’t exist. Long Covid did return to the news last week, with the publication of data from a multi-centre study suggesting that fewer than 30% of patients hospitalised with acute Covid had fully recovered a year later. It’s a stark statistic – yet this study did not account for the significant number of us who were never admitted to hospital, and have still not fully recovered. The most recent ONS data from October reports that 1.2 million people are living with long Covid (in hospitalised and non-hospitalised patients); 36% of those have had it for more than a year, with greatest prevalence in health and social care workers, and people living in more deprived areas. Even if the new variant results in milder disease than previous ones, could more people still end up like me? And how will an already stretched NHS cope if there are new cases of long Covid after this current viral surge? There’s a lot we still don’t know about Omicron; a fuller picture will become evident over the coming weeks and months. Experience from previous variants suggests that vaccination gives some protection against symptoms, even if it doesn’t prevent infection altogether. Long Covid is a complicated, multi-system disease, whose pathological processes have yet to be fully understood, making treatment difficult. This is further compounded by the diverse range of symptoms, so there is no “one size fits all” treatment. Health professionals have been extrapolating treatment strategies from other diseases, but management is not consistent between clinics. A current study aims to address this lack of standardisation by producing a “gold standard” for care, and Nice recently updated its guidance to include individualised treatment plans for those with long Covid. Research into the disease received significant funding in the UK after it was officially recognised in October 2020, with £18.5m in February, at the same time the World Health Organization was emphasising the need for recognition, research and rehabilitation. A further £19.5m was awarded in July this year. It will be a while before we get conclusive data to guide management of the disease, but trials are under way. We’ve come a long way since June 2020, when people with prolonged and unusual symptoms after Covid infection were being dismissed as neurotic. Increasingly vocal individuals and groups posted on social media and found that they weren’t alone in the symptoms that they were experiencing. Primary and secondary care physicians had to take notice, and, once long Covid was officially recognised as a disease, £10m was announced to fund dedicated clinics. This finally opened up care to those who had not been hospitalised. There are now 60 clinics in England to be referred to, and 90 assessment services for triaging patients but availability of care remains a postcode lottery. Northern Ireland has only recently launched its first clinics, but Wales and Scotland still have none. However, even where there are clinics, waiting lists are long, and funding remains insufficient in many places. Additionally, a lack of dedicated physicians and physiotherapists presents a major problem. To improve access, in June this year NHS England announced a further £100m for the expansion of care for long Covid services, including 15 hubs for children and young people, but the lack of a consistent workforce is an ongoing problem. With nowhere to turn to last May, and as a yoga teacher, I set up a group for others I knew who were similarly affected, focusing on exercises to help us improve our breathing. Finally, after a year of illness, I got the support of a physiotherapist, which has been essential for my improvement. I also joined a programme run by the English National Opera that focuses on breathing retraining via singing, where the camaraderie was as helpful as the singing itself. We’ve been on the same physical and emotional rollercoaster of long Covid, sharing health concerns, coping strategies, employment issues and rejoicing in our baby steps of improvements. We laugh, we cry and every fortnight we sing together. Our dream is to meet in person and sing on the stage of the Colosseum. Long Covid isn’t going away soon. Post-viral syndromes are not new, but we have never seen anything on such a scale. I dread the thought of getting the Omicron variant. Who knows how my body would react this time? I first wrote about long Covid a year ago, and I could never have imagined that I would still be unable to work at this point. It seems so strange that, as a consultant in infectious diseases, I’ve had to sit out the entire pandemic from the sidelines, when I should have been playing a vital role.

12/23/2021,"Most New York stories ultimately revolve around property, but one TikTok user has shown the world just how crushing the city’s rental apartment situation has become despite the Covid-19 pandemic. In a 46-second viral clip, AJ Webber offered a tour of his minute, 75 sq ft, low-ceiling West Village dwelling that just barely contains a sink, a microwave, and a loft bed. The short video has now had more than 26m views on the platform.  Webber showed his small shelf space for food with one bowl, one plate and a window. “Here is what it’s like living in the smallest apartment in New York,” Webber, a musician, said. “Whatever your expectations are, lower them.” Webber did not reveal the monthly cost of his apartment, though the New York Post estimated that a similar dorm-like room would be priced at $1,600. Amid the many indignities of New York life, property is among the most contentious. In recent years, landlords have touted the charms of micro-apartments, and the efficiencies of enforcing a no-clutter life. Two years ago, a 242-sq-ft studio on West 12th Street went on the market for $550,000 while developers were rushing to build micro-apartment complexes across the city with dozens of tiny dwellings. Many of Webber’s TikTok correspondents noticed that something was missing from his hidey-hole – namely a bathroom. “Did you not see the window,” he replied to one. In truth, there is a shared bathroom in the building. If he forgets toilet paper, he said, “you have to do a little waddle back to your room”. Responding to Webber’s post, one TikToker wrote simply: “Whatever you’re paying is too much.”",News/US news, Room for one plate: viral TikTok shows off ‘the smallest apartment in New York’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/22/smallest-apartment-new-york-city-tiktok
12/23/2021,"It was early August 2021 and Leighanne was having yet another conversation with her aunt, Samantha Murray, about the Covid vaccine. The former scientist in her 50s was adamant her niece should not get jabbed due to the unknown risks. “She kept saying these vaccines were different and can get into your DNA,” Leighanne remembers. “She was also worried it would affect my fertility.” Almost a month later, on 6 September, Murray, known as Sammie, died at Queen Alexandra hospital, Portsmouth, surrounded by loved ones. Murray, who had refused to get vaccinated, caught Covid-19 in the hotter summer months. She was unable to speak in her final days and induced into a coma. Leighanne’s final interactions with her aunt included video calls where she watched as Murray struggled to speak due to oxygen deprivation.  Her death is among thousands that have taken place since so-called freedom day on 19 July. In the summer, the public awaited what had been billed as a return to normality after more than a year of coronavirus restrictions. Nightclubs reopened as restrictions on large events and social distancing ended. Since then, more than 18,000 people have died from coronavirus and behind those numbers are losses that have left gaping holes in families. Murray was never worried about getting seriously unwell with Covid, Leighanne says. Her aunt was very healthy and although she had asthma she was a vegan who was a keen crossfit fan, she adds. The 53-year-old believed if she did succumb her symptoms would be mild. Leighanne also wants to make it clear that her aunt was not a “crazy anti-vaxxer” and had a history working in clinical trials. She says her aunt wanted more information about the long-term effects. Much of her fears around risks to fertility have been debunked and answered in scientific papers since her death, her niece says. Murray, a former University of Portsmouth PhD student, contracted coronavirus alongside her husband, Silvan Chafiie, and their 15-year-old son, Gabriel. “It was immediate [Murray getting sick]. She was in bed for a few days and could not breathe,” Leighanne says. “I think she had a period feeling better and then she took a turn for the worse and they decided to put her on a ventilator and induced her into a coma.” Leighanne travelled from her home in Barcelona to see her aunt before she died. “She was a very fiercely loyal and very present person who was always on my side,” Leighanne says, remembering her as someone who always enjoyed cooking for her family. Speaking in her eulogy, Leighanne said she had been a nervous child but her aunt was always there to help her stand up for herself. “If something was unjust and someone bullied me she would be outraged and thought it was not right ... She was like a mother and sisterly figure,” she says. Denise Osman lost her friend and ex-partner Christopher Adedeji, 53, in the months after freedom day. The football agent and father of six died on 29 September. Adedeji had a kidney transplant in 2019 so was immunocompromised. He had been vaccinated. Osman was in hospital at the same time, suffering from Covid, so got to spend time with Adedeji before he died. “I had recovered enough to get out and about, although I was very ill myself with it. But as I had contracted it they allowed me on to the ward as I was less of a risk,” she says. She says she had opposed vaccinations before getting sick. “I was prepared to lose my job rather than get the vaccine but seeing people on the ward … it was really scary,” she adds, noting she is now vaccinated. Osman says she found it difficult to recover, while watching her friend deteriorate. “When they decided to put him on a ventilator he knew that he was not going to come back around from that.” She says it was “highly emotional” as her friend realised how ill he was. “He was a massively inspiring person.” Adedeji was a keen footballer as a young man. He moved from Nigeria to Antwerp, Belgium, to play for a team, before being signed to another team in Europe. He later moved to the UK and lived in Levenshulme, Manchester. When he stopped playing he started coaching. Osman says that was his passion and he enjoyed helping young players overcome hurdles to get into the game. “He had six children, and his death is a massive loss for them,” she says. Adedeji was in hospital for a long time and had limited visitors but luckily Osman could be there for him, spending his last few hours by his side. Despite being there, she says, she still finds it hard to acknowledge her friend is gone. “He was such a strong character, such a strong man – such a big character. He is so seriously missed.”",News/World news,"‘A massive loss’: two of the 18,000 UK Covid victims since ‘freedom day’",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/22/massive-loss-two-of-18000-uk-covid-victims-since-freedom-day
12/23/2021,"An analysis of DNA from a 5,700-year-old tomb has revealed the world’s oldest family tree, shedding “extraordinary” light on the importance of family and descent among people who were some of Britain’s first farmers. A research team has examined the bones and teeth of 35 people in one of Britain’s best preserved neolithic tombs, near the village of Hazleton in the Cotswolds. The results, said Dr Chris Fowler of Newcastle University, are nothing short of “astounding”.  The researchers have discovered that 27 were biological relatives from five continuous generations of a single extended family. The majority were descended from four women who all had children with the same man. “It tells us that descent was important,” said Fowler. “When they were building these tombs and deciding who to include in them, certainly in this case, they were selecting people who were close relatives of the people who were first buried there. They have this close connection to their immediate ancestors and that extends over several generations. “Family was important and you can see that with the inclusion of some very young children in the tomb as well.” The tomb, known as the Hazleton North long cairn, is divided into two L-shaped chambered areas and fresh research also shows that the dead were buried according to the women they were descended from. That shows, the study concludes, “that these first-generation women were socially significant in the memories of this community”. The prehistoric group of people in question lived around 3700–3600BC and were some of Britain’s first farmers, with the tomb constructed about 100 years after cattle and cereal cultivation had been introduced from continental Europe. It would be another 700 years before construction started on the most famous neolithic legacy, Stonehenge. Archaeologists know that the people moved around the landscape and were probably herding animals as they did so. They consumed dairy products and had a protein-rich diet and they made pots for storing and cooking food. The latest research shows that family ties also mattered to them. The research is a collaboration between archaeologists from Newcastle University and geneticists from the universities of Harvard, Vienna and the Basque country. The conclusions – the first study to reveal in such detail how prehistoric families were structured – are published in the journal Nature. “This research is really important because it allows us to see what’s going on in neolithic society,” said Fowler. “They are carrying out these burial practices that are tracing lines of descent … they are projecting their community forward into the future. The DNA analysis has revealed ages, genders and family ties. “We have built up a much more detailed biographical picture of those individuals which makes them much more relatable to us as people,” he said. Fowler said similar studies of tombs in Ireland had concluded that remains were not biologically related, which makes the Hazleton North discovery “quite an extraordinary result”. Researchers also found that males who today we would call stepsons were adopted into the lineage, suggesting “blended” families can’t be considered just a modern phenomenon. Iñigo Olalde, the lead geneticist on the study, said using the latest technologies in ancient DNA recovery had allowed the team “to uncover the oldest family tree ever reconstructed and analyse it to understand something profound about the social structure of these ancient groups”. Fowler said the task now was to look at other neolithic tombs to see if a similar pattern existed. Ron Pinhasi, of the University of Vienna, said: “It was difficult to imagine just a few years ago that we would ever know about neolithic kinship structures. But this is just the beginning and no doubt there is a lot more to be discovered from other sites in Britain, Atlantic France, and other regions.”",News/Science,"World’s oldest family tree revealed in 5,700-year-old Cotswolds tomb",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/dec/22/worlds-oldest-family-tree-costwolds-tomb-hazleton-north-long-cairn-dna
12/23/2021,"Daily cases of Covid-19 have passed 100,000 in the UK, according to government figures – making it the highest number since the pandemic began.

More details soon …",News/World news,"Number of new Covid cases in UK passes 100,000 for first time",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/22/number-of-new-covid-cases-in-uk-passes-100000-for-first-time
12/23/2021,"Throughout Britain’s Covid emergency, the public have overwhelmingly supported drastic but necessary measures to combat the virus – even at the cost of their personal freedom. As the Alpha variant threatened to cripple the NHS in January, 85% of people supported lockdown – as near universal as you are likely to achieve in a democratic society – with only 11% opposed, and of those just over half opposed strongly. From the beginning, the prevailing criticism among the electorate has been that Boris Johnson’s administration has been too slow and soft in reacting: in the first weeks of the crisis, two-thirds believed it should have acted faster.  Yet since Omicron revived the Covid threat, that consensus has collapsed. Last week, just 23% of adults in England supported closing pubs and restaurants, 26% backed not allowing people to meet indoors with people outside their household, and there was an even split on large sporting and entertainment events. Those numbers may shift more in favour of restrictions as cases continue to rise, but the difference from last year is stark. The public’s often militant support for authoritarian measures has disintegrated. This is not to say we should succumb to fatalism and let disillusionment with Covid measures veto any response at all. The core dilemmas of the pandemic remain. How do we keep cases as low as possible, above all else to prevent the NHS from being so overwhelmed by Covid patients that it cannot perform its basic function? There is obviously a point where restrictions would be unavoidable, and the lag between infections and later hospitalisation and death makes determining that point and selling the public on it difficult. But we must acknowledge that the waning support of the wider public cannot simply be dismissed as Covid denialism. Or as conspiratorial delusion and heartless contempt for human life, precisely the sort of perverse crankery epitomised by Piers Corbyn. Indeed, to do so risks abandoning the growing ranks of the disenchanted to conspiracy-mongers who claim drastic measures to preserve public health and human life were always as unnecessary as they were malign in intent. Their exhaustion is understandable. It is no surprise that polling shows young people generally most opposed to new restrictions. They have acted as a cordon sanitaire to protect old and medically vulnerable people. While the threat of long Covid to young people should not be dismissed, the risk to their lives has been very low. Yet the ability to socialise or establish relationships in their best years has been criminalised; their educations have been injured; their mental health more damaged than that of older generations. On top of more than a decade of austerity policies that disproportionately targeted the young – and a government which believes there is little to be gained electorally from policies that alleviate their distress – they quite rationally believe they have been abandoned. More widely, consider the 8 million people who live alone, condemned to often painful solitude; the low-paid who, unlike middle-class professionals, were compelled to travel to often unsafe workplaces; or the families in overcrowded flats with no gardens where their children can play. The severity of lockdown always depended on your generation and your class. The trouble isn’t that the public no longer want to stop Covid, rather that the social contract underpinning the pandemic has been shredded. Overwhelming support for lockdown persisted for so long because there seemed to be a stable exit route: that mass vaccination of the population would protect the NHS from the menace of Covid-related collapse. Now that certainty has evaporated an endgame no longer seems sure and the prospect of open-ended restrictions looms. That those responsible for designing the rules and demanding public acquiescence did not abide by the rules themselves – while homeless people were being unlawfully prosecuted for breaking lockdown – further damaged the contract. The true threat posed by Omicron isn’t yet understood, and measures to protect the basic functions of the NHS may need to be taken. But whether the public’s overwhelming obedience to restrictions will endure this time round is now an open question, particularly among younger and poorer Britons who have suffered the worst excesses of the pandemic response. That means emphasising approaches to combat Covid that don’t simply rely on universally restricting freedom. Hiking statutory sick pay and other forms of economic support so workers can afford to self-isolate would improve currently dismal compliance rates, for example. There should also be more support for those who want to work from home, and an emergency programme to improve ventilation in schools and workplaces. As well as helping to contain infections, this would send a powerful message that the government isn’t simply waiting for a new crisis point to be reached before once again abruptly curtailing our freedoms in panicked response. More broadly, there needs to be a focus on permanently and dramatically expanding the capacity of the NHS. In “normal” times this would be of great benefit – people could enjoy a much-improved, less-pressured service – but crucially, the NHS would be protected from shocks such as Covid overwhelming it. This isn’t an instant, straightforward solution – training more medical staff takes time – but a public debate on expanding capacity must surely be the focus. One medical consultant suggests that increasing NHS bed capacity by 10% – back to pre-austerity levels – would allow the service to cope with 200,000 Omicron cases a day, noting it would need to be complemented with improved pay and conditions to retain and recruit staff. If yet another dangerous variant emerges, more restrictions might still be needed – but at least the public would be assured that the government has pursued every possible avenue first. Lockdowns were always understood to come with dire social and educational consequences: but they were a lesser evil than allowing a virus to kill hundreds of thousands, and cause the collapse of the NHS. A sizeable minority are content with indefinite suspensions of freedom – a poll earlier this year found nearly a fifth supported a 10pm curfew, and a quarter the closure of all nightclubs and casinos – but most are rightly not. The false dichotomy between harsh authoritarian measures or mass death must be abandoned for good. But that will require the government to fund and support more targeted measures. A new consensus must be built around such an approach because the public are beginning to snap, and nearly two years on from the outbreaks of mysterious pneumonia-like cases in Wuhan, our suffocated reality is no longer sustainable.

12/23/2021,"Russia claims it has has agreed to begin talks with the US early next year to discuss Moscow’s demands for “security guarantees” in Europe, including a ban on Ukraine’s entrance into the Nato military alliance. If confirmed, the talks would begin a contentious effort to avert a Russian offensive in Ukraine this winter, as Kyiv and eastern European governments have demanded not to be left out of any deal with Moscow that affects their interests as well.  Moscow has moved tanks and artillery towards the border with Ukraine in an apparent invasion threat and issued a contentious list of security guarantees in a draft treaty with Nato that its leadership has called unacceptable. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, announced the talks during an interview with the RT television station on Wednesday, where he said negotiations would start “at the very beginning of next year”. “The first round will be held in the form of a bilateral contact between our and US negotiators, who have already been named and are acceptable for both sides,” Lavrov told the broadcaster, which is backed by the Russian state. The exact agenda and scope of the talks has not been made public and the Kremlin may be keen to exaggerate its diplomatic efforts as it positions itself for a potential attack against Ukraine. US officials have not spoken publicly about the talks yet. “We do not want war,” Lavrov said during an interview. “We do not need conflicts and, hopefully, everyone else does not view conflicts as a desirable course of action.” He also said similar talks would be held with Nato and with the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Details of those talks were also not given. A Kremlin spokesperson also welcomed the talks, telling reporters: “The very fact that such preparedness [for talks] has been reaffirmed is good as it is.” He warned that Russia was wary of the discussions being dragged out and was not interested in participating in “a marathon”. Vladimir Putin had appeared frustrated on Tuesday as he railed against Nato expansion since the fall of the Soviet Union, telling his top military commanders that growing western influence in Ukraine left Russia “nowhere further to retreat to” and that he would not stand by and “watch idly”. Last week, Russia released a draft of a potential treaty with Nato that demanded the military alliance remove all troops and infrastructure installed from European countries that joined the alliance after 1997. That includes countries that were part of the Soviet Union or the Warsaw pact, whose officials say the Russian proposals undermine their sovereignty and security. Nato officials said Jens Stoltenberg, the organisation’s secretary general, had signalled on Tuesday that the military alliance would call for a meeting of the Nato-Russia council early next year, and that any talks with Moscow would have to involve all European members of the alliance and Ukraine. Nato pointed to remarks made by Stoltenberg in a press conference with Romania’s prime minister on Tuesday in which he had said: “Any dialogue with Russia needs to be based on the core principles of European security and to address Nato’s concerns about Russia’s actions. And it needs to take place in consultation with Nato’s European partners, including with Ukraine.” A Nato official said talks would have to be conducted on the basis of reciprocity and must address Nato concerns about the Russian military build-up and other actions, in line with a joint statement from the alliance’s North Atlantic Council agreed last week.",News/World news,‘We do not want war’: Russia says it will begin talks with US and Nato,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/22/we-do-not-want-war-russia-says-it-will-begin-talks-with-us-and-nato
12/23/2021,"Skiers heading for Austria will face increased restrictions this season as after it was announced that all tourists, including those from the UK, will have to show proof of a Covid booster dose. The country’s government met on Wednesday morning to discuss what measures needed to be taken in anticipation of a surge in infections from the Omicron variant when the ski season peaks in January. The variant has already reached Austria, but fewer than 1,000 cases have been confirmed.  The country was open to those who were either fully vaccinated or had proof of recovery from Covid, but this extra restriction – requiring travellers to show proof of a booster vaccine – takes effect immediately. Anyone who hasn’t had their booster will need to have proof of a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours before arrival. A statement on Austria’s official tourism site states: “Austria is reacting to the expansion of the Omicron variant with new entry regulations … this new regulation applies to entry from all countries (including day trips) with the exception of the virus variant areas. Entry without vaccination or convalescence is de facto not possible for vacation purposes.” Responding to the announcement, Crystal Ski Holidays said: “We’re aware that the Austrian government has announced that anyone aged 12 and over will now be required to take a PCR test within 72 hours before their flight arrival time unless they’ve had a booster jab. We’ll be in touch with customers directly to discuss their options.” Elsewhere, Malaysia and Singapore became the latest Asian countries to tighten travel restrictions. Singapore temporarily stopped selling tickets for its quarantine-free “travel lanes” system, which allows vaccinated people from 24 countries to enter, while Malaysia froze sales of bus and flight tickets to Singapore – its only travel corridor. On Monday, Indonesia added people travelling from Britain, Norway and Denmark to its list of those banned from entering the country, and on Tuesday Thailand announced that it will reinstate mandatory Covid quarantine for foreign visitors and scrap a quarantine waiver. The Thai government said the action was being taken because of concerns over the spread of the Omicron variant. However, Switzerland moved in the opposite direction and relaxed some restrictions: fully vaccinated arrivals are now permitted to use cheaper lateral flow, rather than PCR, tests to enter the country. Visitors can now enter Switzerland if they are fully vaccinated and have proof of a negative PCR test (not older than 72 hours) or a lateral flow test (not older than 24 hours) when boarding.",Lifestyle/Travel,Travellers to Austria will need proof of booster vaccine to enter country,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/dec/22/skiers-to-austria-must-show-proof-of-booster-dose-covid-omnicron
12/23/2021,"The UK government’s vaccine advisers have issued new guidance on Covid vaccinations for young people in light of the rapidly spreading Omicron variant. The advice opens up Covid vaccinations for children as young as five and extends the booster programme to more teenagers.  Covid vaccination has been approved for children aged five to 11 after a safety and effectiveness review by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. The approval has paved the way for the independent Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) to recommend Covid jabs for about 330,000 at-risk children in the age group. Children aged five to 11 who are in a clinical risk group or who are a household contact of someone who is immunosuppressed are now eligible to receive a Covid jab. Eligible at-risk five- to 11-year-olds will be offered the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine at one-third of the dose (10 micrograms) used for adults. The recommendation is for a primary course of two doses given eight weeks apart. The JCVI also recommended an extension of the booster programme, with a full 30 microgram Pfizer/BioNTech booster now recommended for three specific groups: 16- to 17-year-olds; 12- to 15-year-olds who are in a clinical risk group, or who live in a house with someone who is immunosuppressed; and 12- to 15-year-olds who are severely immunocompromised and have already had a third primary dose of vaccine. The boosters should be given no sooner than three months after the last shot of their primary course. While the majority of children aged five to 11 are at very low risk of severe Covid, some children with underlying health conditions have a higher risk that can be reduced with vaccination. For those who have already had a primary course of Covid vaccine, the booster will provide added protection against Omicron. The JCVI, which advises on how vaccines should be used once they are approved, expects to issue further advice on Covid vaccines for healthy five- to 11-year-olds in due course. The group wants to review more data before making a recommendation, including evidence of how much protection children acquire against Omicron after a Covid infection. More than 5m doses of the Pfizer vaccine have already been given to five- to 11-year-olds in the US alone. Based on that rollout and evidence from around the world, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has concluded that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the known and potential risks of Covid. The CDC has recorded nearly 2m cases of Covid among the 28 million children aged five to 11 in the country. The virus generally causes mild disease in young people, but Covid remains one of the top 10 causes of death among five- to 11-year-olds. In November, the European Medicines Agency came out in favour of using the Pfizer vaccine for those in the same age group after a randomised clinical trial children. They tend to be. The most common side-effects in children are a sore arm from the injection, tiredness, headache, achy muscles and joints, and sometimes fever, but these typically clear up within a couple of days. The NHS will announce when it can offer the shots, potentially in the next few days, but its primary focus at the moment getting more booster shots into adults. The US medical regulator approved the Pfizer/BioNTech shot for five- to 11-year-olds in November, clearing the way for millions of healthy children to receive a Covid vaccine. The children are given a third of the dose used for adults. Europe has also pressed ahead with vaccinating children in the age group. France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Greece and Hungary are all offering the jabs in the hope of reducing the spread of the virus while keeping schools open.",News/World news,Covid vaccination for UK children: what has been approved?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/22/covid-vaccination-uk-children-what-approved
12/23/2021,"Do you believe in miracles? The NHL and its players’ union apparently do not. They’ve decided to take away the opportunity to put their sport on a grand stage, taking the rash, short-sighted decision to keep their players home while lower-tier journeymen and youngsters skate for Olympic gold in Beijing.  The decision, formalized on Wednesday, was made because of Covid-19 concerns, specifically: 1 The NHL has already postponed many games due to the recent surge in numbers, and they now see the Olympic fortnight as a window in which those games can be played. 2 Beijing’s quarantine rules may be stricter than they like, keeping players out of the country and out of action longer than necessary. The latter is a legitimate concern, but it’s one that can still be discussed with the IOC and Beijing organizers. The deadline for declaring whether NHL players would go to Beijing is 10 January. So why make the decision on 21 December? The former is a misunderstanding of hockey’s place in the sports landscape. The NHL miscalculated in 2018, keeping players out of the Games – that time, to the consternation of the players’ association, which pointedly reminded the league of the opportunity it was missing: “A unique opportunity lies ahead with the 2018 and 2022 Olympics in Asia. The NHL may believe it is penalizing the IOC or the players, or both, for not giving the owners some meaningful concessions in order to induce them to agree to go to Pyeongchang. Instead this impedes the growth of our great game by walking away from an opportunity to reach sports fans worldwide.” Some sports are bigger than the Olympics. Tennis and golf have grand slams. Basketball has the NBA. Men’s soccer has the World Cup. (Women’s soccer does as well, but the World Cup and Olympics are roughly equivalent in the public eye in that case.) Hockey is not one of these sports. In North America, it has a grand tradition and the coolest trophy in sports, the Stanley Cup. In the rest of the world, it has much less. The annual world championship runs during the Stanley Cup playoffs and therefore struggles to attract the best players. A “World Cup” in 2016 was a merely an NHL preseason gimmick. It’s not that the NHL is in terrible shape. The league has expanded to Las Vegas and Seattle, and it has made lucrative long-term deals with ESPN and Turner Sports. But the low ratings for late games on TNT, the four-digit attendance figures in Buffalo and even a dip in attendance in hockey-obsessed Canada are stark reminders that hockey’s place in an increasingly crowded sports landscape is far from guaranteed. The NHL has long been considered one of the ‘“Big Four” US sports leagues. Today, the Premier League and other soccer broadcasts compete quite comfortably with the NHL for ratings. Major League Soccer’s average attendance is higher, though the venues are larger and weeknight games are rare. Women’s basketball and soccer are surging. Factor in MMA and all of the other sports, even cornhole, fracturing the viewing audience, and the “Big Four” could easily become a “Big Three and a Half” or even a “Big Three and Everything Else.” So the NHL can ill afford to squander good will. And yet it’s doing so. NHL leaders are forgetting Olympic hockey’s rich history. The Miracle on Ice, in which a ragtag bunch of US amateurs beat the mighty Soviet Union team in 1980, captured the public’s attention and spawned a major movie. The stakes are so high that Russian fans protested in Moscow after a controversial call helped the US beat Russia in a lengthy penalty shootout. And that was in the preliminary round, with no medals at stake. And the players jump at the opportunity. Olympic basketball teams don’t always draw the best NBA players for a variety of reasons, but Olympic hockey from 1998 to 2014 has been a glittering showcase of the world’s top players. Do we really want to see perennial All-Stars like Seth Jones go through their peak years without having a chance to play in the Games? It’s also a treat for viewers to see hockey on a larger rink, giving skilled players more room to operate. The game is faster and sharper. Viewers don’t seem to miss the fights that are still a part of the game in the NHL. Viewers also respond to rivalries, an aspect of the game the NHL cherishes. Any game featuring any two out of Canada, Russia and the US is must-see TV. A February game between the Arizona Coyotes and Los Angeles Kings is not. To get a sense of what the NHL is throwing away, consider the 2010 gold medal showdown between host Canada and the US. Zach Parise scored with 24 seconds to give the US a tie, only to see Canada’s favorite son, Sidney Crosby, net the winner in overtime. That game drew 27.6m viewers in the US alone. In Canada, roughly half of the population watched. This event wasn’t just a North American phenomenon. Check this video of broadcasts all over the world capturing the drama of Crosby’s winner. Would anyone want to deny players the opportunity to play in such a game? Would anyone want to deny viewers the opportunity to watch such a game? Would anyone want to deny their own sport the opportunity to reach a global audience? Wouldn’t any sports executive move heaven and earth to make sure this opportunity exists? The window might eventually close on its own, given the unpredictable path Covid-19 is taking. But the smart course of action was clearly to keep that window pried open as long as possible rather than slamming it shut so soon.",Sport/Sport,The NHL’s rash decision to skip the Olympics accelerates ice hockey’s decline,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/22/nhl-olympics-beijing-covid-coronavirus
12/23/2021,"The photography book that I returned to more than any other this year was Encampment Wyoming by Lora Webb Nichols, an extraordinary record of life in a US frontier community in the early 20th century. Comprised of photographs by Nichols and other local amateur photographers, it emanates a powerful sense of place. Domestic interiors and still lifes punctuate the portraits, which range from the spectral – a blurred and ghostly adult plaiting the hair of a young girl – to the stylish – a dapper, besuited woman peering through a window. An intimate, quietly compelling portrait of a time, a place and a nascent community.  Perhaps because of the strangely suspended nature of our times, I was also drawn to contemporary books that dealt in quiet reflection. Donavon Smallwood’s Languor was created during the lockdown spring and summer of 2020, as he wandered through the woods in the relatively secluded north-west corner of New York’s Central Park. Smallwood’s images of glades, streams and ravines suggest stillness amid the clamour of the city and are punctuated by his deftly composed portraits of the individuals who were regularly drawn there during the pandemic. The book’s subtext deals with the fraught history of Central Park, a space that has often echoed the city’s racial tensions. “What’s it like to be a black person in nature?” asks Smallwood in this quietly powerful debut. Russian-born photographer Irina Rozovsky’s In Plain Air trained her acute outsider’s eye on another bucolic New York landscape, Brooklyn’s Prospect Park, which, in summer, is a microcosm of the city’s multicultural dynamic. Again, the pandemic is the looming backdrop for these studies of people in human-made nature: walking, resting, working, playing and interacting with each other and their surroundings. A masterfully sustained study in mood, atmosphere and landscape. A much more otherworldly landscape is the setting for another impressive debut, Speak the Wind, by the Iranian-born photographer, Hoda Afshar. She was drawn to the islands of Qeshm, Hormuz and Hengam in the strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf by an age-old local belief that the wind that has shaped the dramatic terrain is also the source of sickness and possession by spirits. Her vividly atmospheric portraits and landscapes evoke the otherness of the islands, but also suggest the invisible and intangible forces, historical and communal, that have shaped this in-between place, and helped form its customs and beliefs. An ambitious, multilayered narrative that repays close attention in its glancing approach to myth, ritual, landscape and the long shadow of colonial history. Originally self-published in a now sought-after limited edition, Tereza Zelenkova’s The Essential Solitude is an altogether different imaginative response to a mysterious place. In this instance, the setting is the gloomy interior of a Grade II listed house in London’s East End, which belonged to the late Dennis Severs, an eccentric who styled it on his imagined idea of what an 18th-century Huguenot dwelling might look like. Influenced by often esoteric literature, from the Decadents to transgressive thinkers such as Maurice Blanchot and Georges Bataille, Zelenkova’s work is rich in symbolism and suggestion, her singular gaze capturing the disorienting atmosphere and fading grander of a house haunted by the extravagant imagination of its creator. A sense of foreboding also attends American photographer Carolyn Drake’s mysterious Knit Club, another ambitiously atmospheric meditation on place and community. Framed as a collaboration between the photographer and an anonymous group of women, part sisterhood, part secret cult, the book is a mischievous play on the southern gothic tradition that also contains a subversive feminist subtext. Drake’s shifting narrative is borrowed from William Faulkner’s novel, As I Lay Dying, while her deftly constructed images nod to clandestine rituals and the contested history of the US south. An often invisible US emerges powerfully from the pages of Matt Black’s epic American Geography, which was six years in the making, the photographer traversing the country by van and Greyhound bus to visit communities with a poverty rate above 20%. He was interested, he told me back in 2016, in “the psychology of poverty”, and he has succeeded in evoking that complex dynamic in monochrome images that are austere and haunting. The visual narrative is threaded though with his own observations, snatches of overheard conversation, and everyday ephemera encountered in bus stations, truck-stops and roadside cafes. A masterwork of contemporary documentary. Perhaps the photography book event of the year was the long-awaited publication of Whatever You Say, Say Nothing, by Gilles Peress, a two-volume epic of his photographs from the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Structured across 22 semi-fictional days, the book is probably the most visceral, and certainly the most ambitious evocation of what it was like to live though the tumult of those violent times. What impresses above all is Peress’s uncanny ability to capture single dramatic moments – of violence, mourning, resistance, brutality – that are repeated throughout like small variations on a bigger theme of tribal and political division. The narrative is overwhelming, as it should be, and an accompanying volume, Annals of the North, provides much needed context. An immensely important book, but a prohibitively pricey one aimed squarely at the photo-book collectors market. Two exhibition catalogues stood out for me this year: James Barnor’s Accra/London: a Retrospective, which accompanied the Ghanaian-born photographer’s exhibition at the Serpentine Gallery, and Coming Up for Air, which was published in tandem with Stephen Gill’s survey show at the Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol. The first showed how Barnor, who is 91, moved effortlessly between genres – portraiture, photojournalism, fashion – while also creating a vibrant record of the lives of ordinary Africans in his native Ghana and the diaspora in the UK. The second was a journey inside the restlessly inventive mind of one of Britain’s most original contemporary photographers that traces Gill’s mischievously subversive gaze from inner city Hackney to rural Sweden. Both are highly recommended. In a strong year for books by female photographers, I was also drawn to Nancy Floyd’s epic of self-portraiture, Weathering Time, which she describes as “my visual diary, personal archive, and record of my changing body and my environment over the past 30-plus years.” Since 1982, Floyd has tried to photograph herself every day, mostly standing impassively on her own, sometimes doing stuff with a dog or a family member in attendance. The book is edited from more than 2,500 images, all of which are pretty ordinary, but accrue a profound resonance when sequenced chronologically. Finally, perhaps the most quietly resonant photo-book I received this year was Odd Time by Mirjana Vrbaski, in which a selection of austerely beautiful portraits that nod to the Dutch old masters give way to almost ghostly images of the deep forest landscapes of the Dalmatian coast. There is a strange purity to both sequences, but it is the portraits of the young women that haunt the imagination with their poise and unreadable expressions. The silence emanating from Vrbaski’s portraits speaks of a deep engagement with her subjects and invests her images with an almost unsettling presence that is hard to pin down, but extraordinarily palpable. A small, perfectly formed book in which the images speak for themselves.",Arts/Art and design,Pandemic park life and a secret knitting cult: the best photography books of 2021,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/dec/22/pandemic-park-life-and-a-secret-knitting-cult-the-best-photography-books-of-2021
