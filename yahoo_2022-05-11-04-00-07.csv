5/11/2022,"An annual event at Lake George in Florida lived up to its name – ""Mayhem at Lake George"" – after videos circulated online of brawls breaking out in the water. Last weekend at the lake 40 miles west of Daytona, hundreds gathered – many on boats – to enjoy music and libations until the mayhem started. “People are just out there to have a good time, but like anything else, when you have a huge concentration of people like this and you have alcohol involved, you do have some incidents,” Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood told WESH 2, an Orlando-Daytona, Fla. NBC TV station. A video posted to the sheriff's office Facebook page show men punching each other in the face and tackling each other into the water near the DJ deck. One man was seriously injured, the Volusia County Sheriff's Office told USA TODAY via email. That man was transported by boat to land then airlifted to a nearby hospital. The sheriff's office said they were following up on the incident and charges are pending. What's everyone talking about?

5/11/2022,"One of John McCain's former top aides alleged the late GOP senator lied about his relationship with a lobbyist. Steve Schmidt claimed he lied on the Senator's behalf to discredit a New York Times article. ""For 14 years I have remained silent because I didn't want to do anything to compromise John McCain's honor,"" Schmidt said. One of John McCain's former top aides said Sunday that he had lied to discredit a New York Times article that reported on McCain's close relationship with a lobbyist. In an essay posted to Substack on Sunday, Steve Schmidt — the senior strategist for McCain's 2008 presidential campaign — said ""John McCain's lie became mine."" Schmidt said he knew about McCain's close relationship with the lobbyist and lying to protect the reputations of McCain and his family. The New York Times reported in 2018 that lobbyist Vicki Iseman was receiving special treatment from the GOP presidential candidate, and shared speculation from some that their relationship may have turned romantic. Both John McCain and his wife, Cindy, denied the accusations of a relationship at a press conference. ""Immediately following the story's publication, John and Cindy McCain both lied to the American people at a news conference that I prepared them for on that same day,"" Schmidt wrote. Schmidt said that after the article came out — which he said ""accurately detailed that relationship"" — McCain told him the truth about the relationship backstage at an event in Ohio. ""For 14 years I have remained silent because I didn't want to do anything to compromise John McCain's honor,"" Schmidt said after apologizing to the Times journalists who wrote the story. He said that McCain's daughter, Meghan McCain, ""abused and bullied"" him to stay silent in the last 14 years. ""The truth is the only remedy that I know to make Meghan's abuse stop,"" he said. ""The truth requires that – at long last – I speak out. It is not a story that I relish telling, but I must because my continued silence stipulates the validity of untrue allegations and petty slanders."" Representatives for Meghan McCain said she declined to comment on the post, as she ""hasn't spoken to [Schmidt] in 14 years."" Of McCain's legacy, Schmidt concluded: ""It is time to look up and out. It is time to look for new leaders. It is time to move on.""

5/11/2022,"Tesla perma-bull Cathie Wood shocked investors on Tuesday after it emerged she had trimmed her holdings in Elon Musk’s electric vehicle manufacturer to buy stock in legacy rival General Motors. Wood has become something of a tech industry oracle for retail investors thanks to her early and aggressive bets on disruptive technologies like EVs, and Tesla has traditionally been her top holding. On Monday, however, the ARK Invest firm she manages as CEO and chief investment officer revealed it had sold 15,862 shares in Musk’s company, worth about $12.7 million, while buying 158,157 shares in GM for nearly $6.1 million, among other portfolio adjustments. While Wood occasionally takes profits on Tesla, also to ensure the fund doesn’t become too top-heavy from the trillion-dollar megacap, the move is striking as even a high-quality name like Tesla has found itself in a slump owing to Musk’s planned acquisition of Twitter. Moreover, ARK Invest itself released research last month that included an extremely bullish price target of $4,600 per share for Tesla in 2026—hardly a signal to markets Wood might shift some of her portfolio toward an incumbent like General Motors. “Hell has officially frozen over,” tweeted Stanphyl Capital fund manager Mark Spiegel, one of the fiercest critics of both Tesla and Wood. Wood however didn’t buy shares in GM because of its exposure to the growing EV market. The company has in fact been heavily mocked by Tesla fans for selling just 483 electric vehicles in its domestic U.S. market over a six-month period through the end of March. In fact, GM shares were added not to the flagship ARK Innovation ETF, but to her ARK Autonomous Technology and Robotics ETF. That’s because the Detroit carmaker is at the forefront of robotaxi development thanks to its 80% stake in Cruise. Wood however continues to concentrate some of the highest risk, highest return stocks in one portfolio, undeterred by market weakness. In December she claimed that some of her favorite names, such as telemedicine service provider Teladoc, were poised for an eventual rebound after recent routs. “Innovation stocks are not in a bubble: We believe they are in deep value territory,” she wrote at the time. Unfortunately for Wood, an inflation-fighting Federal Reserve has for the moment proved otherwise. Its aggressive preparations for a tightening cycle have turned out to be kryptonite for growth-stock–heavy funds like her own. On top of the Fed poisoning über-bullish market sentiment on Wall Street, her reputation for stock picking has also suffered despite her long-term conviction in Tesla. In the run-up to Teladoc’s Q1 results, she added to her position in the company, which already counted her as its largest investor. The bet blew up in her face when the stock promptly lost half its value. The company revealed a larger than expected quarterly loss after effectively admitting it had overpaid $6.6 billion for the takeover of Livongo. As a result, ARK Innovation is trading at levels not seen since the March 2020 lows when the pandemic first erupted. Currently it’s trading down 5% on Tuesday. A deeply religious Christian known for her close friendship with Bill Hwang, Wood recently revealed she had founded ARK Invest with the help of the convicted Archegos hedge fund manager.

5/11/2022,"A driver with Brink’s security used his company-issued clear lunch bag to steal more than $1 million from ATMs at Michigan banks and credit unions, officials said. The driver — who stopped showing up to work after he is believed to have stolen from 24 teller machines on six days — is now being charged in federal court. His last day of work was Dec. 28, the sixth day money was stolen from ATMs. Authorities say Reginald Carman, 23, stole $1,060,200 in cash from seven federally insured financial institutions while working as a driver who serviced their ATMs, according to a criminal complaint filed in court. While most of the money has been returned in its “original ‘bricked’ or ‘strapped’ condition,” authorities say $22,260 was still missing as of the March court filing. Carman’s defense attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment from McClatchy News on May 10. After Carman was caught, the man did admit to a Brink’s regional security manager that he had been stealing money, according to court records. “Carman advised that his father had recently passed away and his mind was not right when he was stealing the money,” authorities said. “(He) said he did not spend any of the money and did not think about spending the money.” Authorities note that some of the bricks of cash returned were “loose,” and four bricks are short a total of $3,720. This is included in the $22,260 still missing. Brink’s did not immediately respond to a request for comment from McClatchy News on May 10. On Jan. 6, a credit unit representative reported to the FBI that its ATMs have been short about $350,000 since the middle of December, records say. The representative said Brink’s notified the credit union of the discrepancy. The next day, a special agent says he spoke with a Brink’s regional security manager. The manager reported he was investigating the earlier incident and identified Carman as the driver who had serviced those machines. In Dec. 21 video footage, Carman was seen placing what appeared to be a “Brink’s clear bag full of currency into a Brink’s clear bag/lunch box,” according to court records. Those bags are issued to workers so lunch and personal belongings can be seen by surveillance. “Later in the day, shortly before arriving back at the Brink’s Lansing branch, (he) stopped the truck, looked out of the truck windows, grabbed the Brink’s clear bag/lunch box, and exited the truck with the Brink’s clear bag/lunch box, taking it to what appeared to be a dark-colored truck or sport utility vehicle,” officials said. Brink’s security noted the bag appeared “full and heavy,” as Carmen used both hands to pick it up, according to the complaint. But earlier footage shows the bag “appeared to be light and mostly empty at the start of Carman’s shift.” When Carman was asked to return the money, officials say he gave back about $650,000 — more than Brink’s estimated was missing. During the Jan. 6 meeting, Carman “said he could not justify his actions regarding the thefts and that he did not have a reason for stealing the money,” according to court records. He also admitted to using the clear bag to steal money, and he signed a statement saying he stole from the ATMs. As Brink’s continued to investigate, authorities identified Carman as a suspect in more thefts at more banks. “I don’t even know at this point,” Carman is recorded saying on Jan. 12 when asked which institutions he stole from. He also returned more money and “said he knew that his actions were wrong and that he did not know why he stole money or why he did not stop stealing money.” Carman met with the investigator on several occasions throughout the investigation, turning in more money as it continued, officials said. Authorities believe Carman is responsible for thefts that occurred from Nov. 15 to Dec. 28. Of the $1,060,200 that was stolen, Carman has returned $1,037,940. Carman was indicted on 12 counts of bank larceny in federal court on April 19. A jury trial has been scheduled for June 28. Duped ‘lottery winners’ swindled out of $460,000, feds say.

5/11/2022,"By James Pearson NEWPORT, Wales (Reuters) -Russia was behind a massive cyberattack against a satellite internet network which took tens of thousands of modems offline at the onset of Russia-Ukraine war, the United States, Britain, Canada, Estonia and the European Union said on Tuesday. The digital assault against Viasat's KA-SAT network in late February took place just as Russian armour pushed into Ukraine. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the cyberattack was intended ""to disrupt Ukrainian command and control during the invasion, and those actions had spillover impacts into other European countries."" British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss called the satellite internet hack ""deliberate and malicious"" and the Council of the EU said it caused ""indiscriminate communication outages"" in Ukraine and several EU member states. The Viasat outage remains the most publicly visible cyberattack carried out since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in part because the hack had immediate knock-on consequences for satellite internet users across Europe and because the crippled modems often had to be replaced manually. ""After those modems were knocked offline it wasn't like you unplug them and plug them back in and reboot and they come back,"" the U.S. National Security Agency's Director of Cybersecurity Rob Joyce told Reuters on the sidelines of a cybersecurity conference on Tuesday. ""They were down and down hard; they had to go back to the factory to be swapped out."" The precise consequences of the hack on the Ukrainian battlefield have not been made public, but government contracts reviewed by Reuters show that KA-SAT has provided internet connectivity to Ukrainian military and police units. The satellite modem sabotage caused a ""huge loss in communications in the very beginning of war,"" Ukrainian cybersecurity official Victor Zhora said in March. In a statement, Ukraine's State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection said that Russia ""is an aggressor country attacking Ukraine not only on our land, but in cyberspace too."" The Russian Embassy in Washington did not immediately return a message seeking comment. Moscow routinely denies it carries out offensive cyber operations. Viasat said in a statement that it ""recognized"" the announcement and would continue to work with government officials to investigate the hack. The company did not provide an update on a Viasat official's comments to Reuters in late March that the hackers were still trying to interfere with the company's operations, albeit to limited effect. [L2N2VW2XC] The satellite modem-wrecking cyberattack remains the most visible hack of the war, but many others have taken place since and not all of them have been made public. ""That was the biggest single event,"" said Joyce. ""It certainly had new and novel tradecraft, but there have been multiple attacks."" (Reporting by James Pearson.

5/11/2022,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China would prefer to take over neighboring Taiwan without military action but is working to get to a position where its military could prevail even if the United States intervenes, U.S. intelligence chiefs said on Tuesday. China views Taiwan, a democratically governed island, as its ""sacred"" territory and has never renounced the possible use of force to ensure eventual unification. The United States, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is its most important international supporter and arms supplier, making it a constant source of tension between Beijing and Washington. ""It's our view that they (the Chinese) are working hard to effectively put themselves into a position in which their military is capable of taking Taiwan over our intervention,"" Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told the Senate Armed Services Committee. Haines and Lieutenant General Scott Berrier, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, testifying on worldwide threats to U.S. national security, discussed the lessons China may be taking from the war in Ukraine and the international response to it. Haines said she did not believe the war was likely to accelerate China's plans on Taiwan. Berrier said using the military to achieve its objective was not Beijing's top choice. ""I believe the PRC (People's Republic of China) would rather not do it by force. I think they would rather do this peacefully over time,"" Berrier said. China was learning ""some very interesting lessons"" from the Ukraine conflict including the importance of leadership and small unit tactics, as well as effective training with the right weapons systems and a strong non-commissioned officer force, Berrier said. U.S. officials needed to work with their partners in the Indo-Pacific and Taiwan's leadership, Berrier said, ""to help them understand what this conflict has been, about what lessons they can learn and where they should be focusing their dollars on defense and their training. ""They have a largely conscript force. I don't believe it is where it should be,"" Berrier said of Taiwan.
