3/3/2022,"Following a segment on Tucker Carlson Tonight, Wednesday, Carlson, who is Fox News's most popular opinion host, came under fire for questioning the credentials of President Biden’s Supreme Court Nominee, Ketanji Brown Jackson. This came just days after he attacked her very nomination, saying it would humiliate the Supreme Court, and make the U.S. look like Rwanda. Taking a different approach than he did for any of former President Trump’s three nominees, all of whom are white, Carlson demanded to know what Brown got on her Law School Admission Test, otherwise known as LSAT. “So is Ketanji Brown Jackson, that even Joe Biden has trouble pronouncing, one of our top legal minds in the entire country? Certainly hope so. Biden’s right, appointing her is one of his gravest constitutional duties,” Carlson said. “So it might be time for Joe Biden to let us know what Ketanji Brown Jackson’s LSAT score was. How’d she do on the LSATs? Why wouldn’t he tell us that? That would settle the question conclusively as to whether she’s a once-in-a-generation legal talent. It would seem like American’s in a democracy have a right to know that and much more before giving her a lifetime appointment, but we didn’t hear that.” Carlson’s demand was not well received on Twitter. DNC Chair Jaime Harrison took it upon himself to put forth Jackson’s academic accomplishments. Judge Brown Jackson graduated Magna Cum Laude from Harvard, Cum Laude from Harvard Law, & was the editor of the Harvard Law review. She is the real deal. I’ve never heard “Tie Too Tight” ask about lsat scores for other nominees, but typical of those who feel a bit “inadequate.” https://t.co/GeU6qE1isG — Jaime Harrison, DNC Chair (@harrisonjaime) March 3, 2022 So, despite not knowing the meaningless answer to what Jackson got on the LSAT, Carlson’s question about her academic prowess has been answered. Tucker Carlson Tonight airs weeknights at 8 p.m. on Fox News Channel. Watch Stephen Colbert handle a hilarious gaffe on a live Late Show following the State of the Union: There was a bit of a gaffe on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert Tuesday, which aired live following President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address. As always with live TV, you never know what is going to happen. In this case, the wrong clip played that in no way went with the punchline Colbert began to deliver.
“Biden touted his COVID response,” Colbert said, before a clip played in which Biden announced that the Department of Justice would soon name a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud.
“Wow,” Colbert said, “I didn’t know Joe was in the cast…”
That’s as far as Colbert made it before he doubled over laughing.
“We’ve skipped ahead in our video a little bit. We’ve never made a live mistake before, so…you’re all…” Colbert said, laughing. He added, “This is how the sausage is being made, ladies and gentlemen. But rarely do we let live cameras in.”
The clip of Biden that was supposed to play, and this makes a lot more sense given the punchline, was the president talking about antiviral pills to treat COVID going forward.
“I’ve ordered more pills than anyone in the world has,” Biden says in the clip. “Wow, I didn’t know Joe was cast in the next season of Euphoria,” Colbert said, straight-faced before celebrating getting it right. “There you go! Boom! Oh! Oh! Nothing like a live show, ladies and gentlemen.”
For those who are unaware, Euphoria is a show on HBO about drug-addicted teens starring Zendaya.
