5/7/2022,"Olha Hlushchenko - Saturday, 7 May 2022,  01:55 The Armed Forces of Ukraine has killed 21 invaders and destroyed some of the aggressors’ military equipment, including a Grad multiple rocket launcher, a TOR surface-to-air missile system and howitzers at the southern borders of Ukraine's defence. Source: ""Pivden"" (South) Task Force on Facebook Details: The aggressors continued to conduct hostilities at occupied positions, but have not been specifically active over the past 24 hours in the Kherson and Mykolayiv regions. Meanwhile, the aggressors launched 5 missile attacks and conducted shelling using Smerch multiple rocket launchers. One missile was destroyed by anti-aircraft fire in the Mykolaiv region, while the rest struck a previously destroyed railway bridge. Air Defence Force destroyed an aggressors’ missile near Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi, Odesa region in the morning of 6 May. Two missiles struck Odesa in the evening on 6 May. No casualties had been reported. The aggressors’ attempts to carry out air reconnaissance with UAV in the Mykolayiv region failed with the destruction of the Orlan-10 UAV. The total aggressors’ losses over the past 24 hours amounted to 21 invaders and 7 units of military equipment, including, in addition to the Orlan UAV,  4 self-propelled howitzers, one Grad multiple rocket launcher, one TOR surface-to-air missile system, which was deployed for use on Zmiinyi (Snake) Island. The naval group of the Russian fleet continues to control the north-western part of the Black Sea, blocking Ukraine’s ports and international shipping, and threatening missile strikes on all Ukrainian territory from the sea. Psychological pressure and propaganda to make the civilian population accept living conditions in the fake republics continues in the occupied territories. Exits from the occupied settlements are blocked. The aggressors’ forces are attempting to carry out provocations and information jamming in the areas bordering Transnistria: they allege that Ukrainian defence forces are carrying out aggressive actions. ""However, the border is well protected, our units have not recorded any unusual situations that affect the state of border protection,"" reads a statement by ""Pivden"" Task Force.",World/Ukrayinska Pravda,South: Ukrainian Armed Forces kill 21 invaders and destroy aggressors equipment,https://news.yahoo.com/south-ukrainian-armed-forces-kill-225558075.html
5/7/2022,"People against vaccine and mask mandates have argued that they impose on a person's bodily autonomy. That rallying cry of ""my body, my choice"" was rooted in the abortion-rights battles of Roe v. Wade. Yet those people against vaccine and mask mandates are now encouraging the potential demise of abortion rights. The leak of the Supreme Court draft opinion that would end Roe v. Wade has been met with approval by many conservatives who championed the very same notion of bodily autonomy and personal choice throughout the pandemic. Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona, for example, urged the justices to move ahead with the decision on Tuesday. Yet, while railing against vaccine mandates last June, he said that they ultimately mean that ""personal autonomy means nothing. It is no longer your body, it is no longer your choice."" Bodily autonomy has become a familiar line of argumentation from anti-vaxxers, vaccine skeptics, and anti-maskers in recent years. ""Medical freedom,"" ""bodily autonomy"" and ""my body, my choice"" became watchwords of an anti-vaccine movement turbocharged in the COVID-19 pandemic. Leading anti-vaccine campaigners and conspiracy theorists — such as Erin Elizabeth and Sherri Tenpenny — have marshaled the cause of ""bodily autonomy"" over and over again. Both were infamously dubbed among the ""Disinformation Dozen"" by the Center for Countering Digital Hate. Tenpenny has called abortion ""slaughter."" But the concept of personal control over what medical choices one takes gained prominence in the abortion-rights movement that led to the landmark 1973 judgment of Roe v. Wade. Then, it was applied to the decision of whether or not to bear a child to term. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott invoked that thinking last December when railing against vaccine mandates, telling Fox News' Sean Hannity the issue was about ""whether or not somebody is going to have something put into their body that they do not want put into their body,"" Rolling Stone reported. Yet in May that year Abbott imposed one of the most restrictive abortion bills in the US, banning abortions after six weeks even in the case of rape or incest. He also called on the Supreme Court to follow through with the draft opinion, the Houston Chronicle reported. ""The conceptual inconsistency would be laughable if the issues weren't so crucially important,"" Prof. Timothy Caulfield, an expert in public-health ethics at the University of Alberta, told Insider. ""Their argument was often that it is an infringement on individual rights to, for example, ask someone to wear a mask during a pandemic,"" he said. ""But this same community is totally fine restricting something a fundamental as reproductive autonomy. Huh?"" Throughout the pandemic, this view was precisely mirrored — and inverted — by the vaccine skeptics. ""If you support a national vaccine mandate, but shout 'my body, my choice!' in support of aborting of a baby with its OWN AUTONOMOUSLY BEATING HEART … you might be an evil asshole,"" tweeted Steven Crowder, a conservative comedian, last September. On Tuesday, Crowder said that he ""can't contain"" his excitement at the Supreme Court decision. Elizabeth, of the ""Disinformation Dozen,"" made the same point in a Telegram post on the day of the leak. ""It is just so preposterous to me that the people saying 'my body my choice' are the same ones who demanded that we be vaccinated in order to go to our jobs or in order for our children to go to school,"" she said. Prof. Tina Rulli, an ethicist at the University of California's philosophy department, told Insider: ""The irony is that the exact reverse is true."" In a co-authored paper for the journal ""Bioethics,"" Rulli and Prof. Stephen Campbell of Bentley University's philosophy department compared the competing claims of infringement on bodily rights brought about by the vaccine-skeptic and pro-life movements. Even if one accepts the premise that a fetus has same human rights as a legal person — a far from universal view — the logic of ""my body, my choice"" is weaker when marshaled against vaccine mandates rather than forced birth, they wrote. The paper argued that with abortion, the death of a fetus is a serious, intentional, moral decision made towards an identifiable being. By contrast, an unvaccinated person who caused someone else's COVID-19 death may never learn of it, and most likely didn't intend it, they wrote. However, the harms caused to others by refusing to be vaccinated can extend to many people, and range from mild to multiple deaths — and getting jabbed is much less inconvenient than the burden of carrying to term and giving a lifetime of care to a child, the professors wrote. ""Pro-life advocates who believe that the 'sanctity of life' justifies the enormously burdensome costs of gestation mandates should have a very low tolerance for actions that pose a substantial risk of death to others when the costs of avoiding such risks are minimal,"" they wrote. A vaccine mandate means that ""worst case, you can't attend school or you lose your job,"" Rulli told Insider. ""That's serious, but it's not a bodily imposition."" ""Abortion restrictions, however, are true physical impositions; pregnant people are required to stay that way and give birth even at risk to their health,"" she said. ""[...] Being an anti-vaxxer who cares about bodily autonomy while also being pro-life makes no sense.""
