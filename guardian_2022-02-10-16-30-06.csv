2/10/2022,"Surprise is not much of a factor in Death on the Nile, Kenneth Branagh’s second gaudy, glossy all-star adaptation of an Agatha Christie chestnut. As with its predecessor, 2017’s marginally worse Murder on the Orient Express, this old-school mystery pulls from a source text so well-known that its twists have practically become embedded genre tropes; even if you don’t know the oft-told story, you can guess your way through it on cliches and character types alone.  Decked out with chintzy CGI, stiff performances and enough processed cheese to fill the Nile, it’s not exactly a good film — even “proficient” feels like a stretch — but it is an oddly comforting one. Watching Branagh’s absurdly moustachioed Hercule Poirot waddle through the motions of supposedly expert crime-solving — as bloodied, satin-clad corpses pile up around him — offers equivalent satisfaction to piecing together a jigsaw puzzle on a rainy Sunday: you know what the outcome is going to be, but there’s something soothing in putting it all together. If it’s a murder-mystery you aren’t already familiar with, so much the better, but the genre’s process-based pleasures are consistent either way. A good whodunnit, or even an attractively bad one, is the fictional equivalent of Marie Kondo organising your sock drawer. Evidently, I’m not the only person to feel this way, since a full century after Hercule Poirot first appeared in print, the good old-fashioned whodunnit is suddenly hot property again. Branagh hasn’t been the only major film-maker to usher it back into popular culture. Neither of his Christie films can claim the hip currency of Rian Johnson’s nifty 2019 potboiler Knives Out, which blended wink-wink Christie homage — a rambling house full of oddball murder suspects, one eccentrically accented gentleman detective to figure it all out — with decidedly less retro class politics pulled straight out of Donald Trump’s America. The cocktail worked more successfully than even Johnson surely imagined. After grossing over $300m worldwide and landing him an Oscar nomination, the film wasn’t just approved for a sequel but a whole megabucks franchise: Netflix paid a whopping $469m to secure the next two adventures of Detective Benoit Blanc, plunging the improbably cast Daniel Craig, newly escaped from his 007 stint, right back into franchise-lead duty. Pitting Craig’s Neo-Poirot against a fresh batch of big-name subjects including Janelle Monae, Kathryn Hahn and Ethan Hawke, Knives Out 2 (a cleverer title is doubtless to be confirmed) completed shooting in Greece last summer and will be out later this year, with its plot (naturally) kept strictly under wraps. Whether it matches the popular impact of its predecessor remains to be seen, but Netflix is counting on the accessibility of their release model to keep the series hot. It’s not the streaming giant’s only whodunnit sequel of the year either. The generically titled Murder Mystery may not have made much of an impression on cinephiles in 2019, but like so many of the disposable comedies made under Adam Sandler’s ongoing Netflix contract, it was a stealth phenomenon with subscribers, and remains one of the streamer’s most-viewed originals. Nearly three years on, I couldn’t tell you a thing that happens in it — Sandler, Jennifer Aniston, murdery hijinks on a luxury yacht — but Murder Mystery 2 is inevitably in production just the same, the Lidl adjunct to Johnson’s Waitrose caper. Expect both franchises to run in parallel for some time. Somewhat more enticing is See How They Run, a debut feature from British TV director Tom George that appears to be all plummy throwback charm: Sam Rockwell in a fedora and walrus ‘tache as a jaded inspector, Saoirse Ronan as his naive police-constable sidekick, a case involving multiple murders in London’s theatre scene. You can practically hear the warm creak of the floorboards; the classy supporting cast includes Ruth Wilson, David Oyelowo and Harris Dickinson. (Well, there’s no sense in a rogue’s gallery of faces you don’t recognise.) Meanwhile, just as Lego Movie co-creator Chris Miller’s murder-mystery comedy series The Afterparty is taking off on Apple TV — with Tiffany Haddish as a detective investigating a murder at a high-school reunion — the 2022 release slate also offers Reunion, a low-profile film with an identical-sounding premise and a cast including Lil Rel Howery and Billy Magnussen. One suspects The Afterparty will dwarf it in publicity stakes, though Miller’s series has yet to match the noise generated by TV’s biggest new whodunnit hit: sparked by the unlikely combination of Selena Gomez with Steve Martin and Martin Short, Only Murders in the Building built enough of a devoted word-of-mouth following last year to be renewed for a second series. Co-created by Martin himself, the arch, playful Only Murders in the Building boasts a postmodern premise that may in itself partly explain the genre’s grand resurgence. Forgoing a detective figure, the film instead focuses on three neighbours in an Upper West Side apartment block attempting to unravel a suspicious death in the building on their own, driven by their own shared fascination with true-crime podcasts. The rise of true-crime storytelling over the last decade — whether in podcast or Netflix docuseries form — seems an obvious cue for fiction’s re-embrace of the procedural mystery. Such true-crime works may often be cloaked in solemn journalistic trappings and an air of social import, but they often lure in their audience on the same basis as any Agatha Christie potboiler — appealing to our collective lurid fascination with human evil, and our rational urge to piece together some manner of explanation or corrective to it all. At a time when public trust in official law and order is at an understandable low, it’s perhaps no surprise that escapist stories allowing the audience to solve crime for themselves are back in vogue. That private detectives like Poirot and Benoit Blanc exert authority without being cops seems key to their renewed appeal, though they’re also mere proxies for the viewer’s own mental sleuthing.",Arts/Film,Killer comeback: the big-star Hollywood whodunnit is back again,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/10/knives-out-death-on-the-nile-whodunnit-murder-mystery-movies
2/10/2022,"Northern Ireland’s first legally binding climate act faces a race against time to get passed before the devolved institutions at Stormont are dissolved in the coming weeks. The second of two climate change bills – introduced by the agriculture minister, Edwin Poots – has moved through consideration stage, with a batch of new amendments prompting more than 25 hours of assembly debate.  But its passage into law is threatened by a congested legislative timetable in the time before Stormont’s dissolution next month to allow for elections. After Paul Givan’s resignation as first minister last week, deputy first minister Michelle O’Neill said the climate bill was among high-priority pieces of legislation that parties would hope to fast-track before the approaching deadline. New features to the bill will see the legislation introduce a 2050 net zero target for Northern Ireland, along with an independent Climate Change Commissioner’s office. Other amendments added to the bill will include a “just transition” fund aimed at supporting agriculture, statutory carbon budgets, targets for biodiversity and soil quality. There will also be a commitment that 10% of future transport budgets will go towards active travel. Northern Ireland is the only jurisdiction in the UK and Ireland at present without dedicated climate legislation. The country’s low public transport spend (27% per head compared with the UK average) and declining biodiversity levels, among other considerations, have emboldened calls for a promised climate act. The Green party NI leader, Clare Bailey, who tabled a first climate bill in 2020, told assembly members this week: “A majority of MLAs have made it clear that they support robust and ambitious climate legislation for Northern Ireland. We will have a net zero Climate Change Act for Northern Ireland, in whatever form it takes, because people want it, and the climate emergency demands it. The Tory members Craig Mackinlay Steve Baker Peter Lilley Esther McVey Robert Halfon Julian Knight Anne Marie Morris (currently independent) Andrew Bridgen David Jones Scott Benton Damien Moore Mark Jenkinson Andrew Lewer Karl McCartney Marcus Fysh Greg Smith Lee Anderson Philip Davies Adam Holloway Craig Tracey “It was not so long ago that climate denial was rife in Stormont. I never thought we would see the day where we had such consensus across the political spectrum that action on climate change was urgent and necessary. “The voice of the people has been heard. The will of the assembly has been recorded. I hope that the minister will respect democracy. It’s time for a Climate Change Act for Northern Ireland.” An amendment proposing greater monitoring of Northern Ireland’s nitrogen levels was voted down last week and another proposed amendment seeking an outright ban on fracking was excluded from the consideration stage debate. A separate fracking bill, which follows a 2020 moratorium on petroleum licensing and drilling, is making its way through the assembly. About two weeks are expected for any final amendments to be made to the climate change legislation, before the bill progresses to a final-stage vote and can then become law. Civil society groups and campaigners who had previously criticised the bill’s lack of ambition have welcomed the new additions to the legislation. Daithí McKay, from the Climate Coalition Northern Ireland group, said the bill in its amended form “represents a progressive way forward to net zero”. He added: “The public expects the assembly to deliver and we now need a clear timetable from the minister setting out when he plans to complete the passing of the climate change act.” Friends of the Earth NI director James Orr said: “If the amended bill passes, Northern Ireland will be in a position to hold its head high with the right climate action alongside the rest of the UK and the ROI and will no longer be the only place on these islands without climate legislation. “We must ensure that these amendments are refined and developed to form a collective climate change act that is greater than the sum of its parts – one which truly reflects the gravity of the climate crisis and what needs to be done.”  Greenwashing is a form of marketing spin, in which companies persuade the public that their products, aims and policies are environmentally friendly. The term was coined by environmentalist Jay Westerveld in 1986 to refer to the corporate practice of making sustainability claims to cover a questionable environmental record. An absolute greenhouse gas emissions target aims to reduce overall climate pollution by a specific amount.  A net-zero goal is meant to offset all greenhouse gas emissions by  capturing them, planting trees to absorb them, or paying for the development of cleaner energy.  An intensity reduction seeks to cut the rate of planet-heating emissions that accompanies each unit of energy produced. Poots, a strong advocate for Northern Ireland’s agrifood industry, said that implementing a 2050 net zero target would have “profound and irreversible consequences” for the sector. He has also suggested he would seek to “exempt” farmers from some of the bill’s requirements. He said: “I am disappointed that the assembly have agreed an amendment to my climate change bill to set a 2050 net zero target. “To push to net zero within that timeframe will have profound and irreversible consequences for our agri-food sector and our economy. “I will now consider my next steps and aim to find a way forward that minimises the impacts on our agri-food sector and maximises the benefits for the climate change agenda. The approach and actions have to balance climate change, the economy and the wider environment.”",News/Environment,Climate change bills in Northern Ireland edge closer to completion,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/10/climate-change-bills-in-northern-ireland-edge-closer-to-completion
2/10/2022,"In the church we catch sight of a 17th-century cavalier, ringlets cascading over his shoulder armour, rising on to his elbow as if disturbed from a long nap. Under the bell tower we discover stones incised with the shapes of broadswords, medieval faces and a Celtic whale. Then, emerging into the sunlight, we investigate the strange circular graveyard, wondering if this must have been a pagan site. From the shadows of ancient yew trees, a green bird bursts out, showing us the way down into a field full of furrows where a crystal stream burbles. Ahead of us on a turfed mound is a peculiar shrine.  “This is exactly what I want,” says my companion for the day, Carol Watson. “A good fort should be about exploration and discovery.” We are actually inside an ancient military encampment, an enormous one, with earthworks and ramparts covering about 300 hectares of fields and woodland near the North Yorkshire village of Stanwick St John, about six miles from Scotch Corner on the A1. When Sir Mortimer Wheeler first excavated the site in 1951, he concluded that it was a massive fort built around the time of the Roman invasion of Britain by a tribal queen called Cartimandua. She famously sided with the Romans and, when the chance came, handed the rebel leader Caractacus over to them. Digs have turned up all sorts of objects: Italian glass, wine amphorae, chariot wheels, swords and, famously, the Meyrick helmet, one of only four iron age helmets to have been discovered in Britain (it’s now in the British Museum). More recently, a Durham University team uncovered a burial site in which a horse’s head had been placed on the body of an adult male. Carol and I walk up through some impressive ramparts, then across empty fields to a line of trees. Here we pick up the line of the rampart again and find a section of wall that Wheeler had rebuilt to give an idea of the original wall. It is an impressive four and a half metres tall. We push on through undergrowth, following a faint trail that eventually ends at a faded wooden sign hand-painted with the word “Private”. Stanwick St John has many footpaths, but the site requires a bit of detective work and exploration, which is exactly what Carol wanted when she started the website Fort for the Day. “Ever since I explored the Roman ruins at Bainbridge as a child, I’ve been fascinated by forts. Then during the first lockdown, while I was working for English Heritage at Richmond Castle, I started to realise that there were hundreds of forts marked on Ordnance Survey maps of Great Britain – sites that probably attract very few visitors, but are great to explore.” The website she devised gives location details for a new fort every day of the year, plus links to OS maps to help users work out a walking route. Other links give an understanding of what’s there. After that, the exploration and discovery is up to you. There are few parts of the country where a fort cannot be found. Carol has many favourites: “Spitbank in the Solent and Inch Garvie in the Firth of Forth are wonderful. Cramond and Bo’ness near Edinburgh. Many places don’t even have names and you might not think there’s much to see, until you start exploring.” Our own walk curls back round to the church of Saint John the Baptist, where we started, and the alabaster figure of Sir Hugh Smithson (d.1670), but we have barely scratched the surface. I can see there is a possible longer route around the outer perimeter. Stanwick itself remains slightly enigmatic, no doubt still hiding many secrets. What we do know is that around AD70, the fort was either abandoned or taken by the Romans. Then came layer upon layer of history, notably the Anglo-Saxon stones and the church’s handsome grave effigies. It’s been a fascinating day and I’m now determined to investigate a location I spotted years ago: a large earth mound near my house that is marked on the OS map simply as “Fort”. It’s about time I explored it. Roman fort, Wimbledon Common Caesar’s Camp fort on Wimbledon Common is a 300-metre-diameter hill fort that actually dates back to the third century BC. These days it serves as a feature on a golf course, but there are some plaques to denote the boundaries. A footpath skirts the northern edge and another bisects the site from east to west. The common is a good place for urban wildlife watching, with badgers, foxes and muntjac deer spotted. Unfortunately, the common’s most secretive creature, the Womble, is rarely seen these days.OS Landranger map LR 176 West London. Grid ref: TQ 224711 St Ann’s Hill, ChertseyIt’s no surprise that forts were built at important crossroads, but this one turns up at the intersection of the M3 and M25. It’s a fine lookout point that has been used since prehistoric times, and over the years archaeological digs have produced flints and spearheads. In medieval times monks grew vines here. Later it was owned by the courtesan Mrs Armistead, who started her career working in brothels and later married Whig politician and dandy Charles James Fox. The site offers a nice woodland walk with views to the Chilterns – and Heathrow airport.OS Landranger map LR 176 West London. Grid ref: TQ 02656745 Bainbridge, North YorkshireWatson’s early inspiration boasts an impressive location: on top of an ice age drumlin. Around AD100, the Romans built a defensive position overlooking the confluence of the rivers Bain and Ure, with good views up and down Wensleydale. Stonework was added around AD190, but only the evocative ramparts survive. Carol’s favourite view of the fort is from the north bank of the Ure.OS Landranger map 98, Wensleydale & Upper Wharfedale.

2/10/2022,"“It’s the whole ecosystem – just gone in that area,” said James Cole. The eighth or ninth generation of Whitby fishers in his family, Cole has never seen anything like the death and decimation of marine life that has plagued the waters since autumn, from coral, crabs, seals and sea birds. He has witnessed “nothing on that scale or that magnitude to cause that type of damage.”  The first worrying report was in October, from fishers in South Gare, at the mouth of the River Tees in Redcar and Cleveland, along England’s north-east coast. “Their lobsters died,” recounts Cole, as he unloads a meagre catch from his boat, Good Intent, at Whitby fish market. Then Coles heard from anglers in the same area looking for shore crabs, normally easily caught in rockpools or shallow waters. “They couldn’t find none, they were all dead.” More worryingly, says Coles: “From there, day on day, it spread up along the coast with the prevailing flood tide.” Four months on, crab and lobster fishers from Hartlepool to Scarborough report that their catches are a tenth of what they would normally expect at this time of year. This is a brutal blow to the coastline that is home to the largest lobster and brown crab fishery in Europe. More than 3,000 tonnes of shellfish have landed in the three main ports of Bridlington, Scarborough and Whitby, Yorkshire. “My heart is broken at the scenes of devastation,” says Stan Rennie. A Hartlepool-based commercial fisher, he received his first fishing boat for his thirteenth birthday. He contrasts waters which were “rich fishing grounds only five months ago” to the present day. “There’s nowt to catch. Fishermen are relying on savings, to try and pay the bills and boat maintenance, they could be staring unemployment in the face, if the stocks don’t recover fast enough, otherwise they’ve had it.” Cole is not only concerned for the fishing industry. “This is about more than just jobs. It’s the destruction of the environment.” This seems to have affected most living creatures on the seabed. “We’ve seen dead octopus, all varieties of crab, lobster, dead men’s fingers – a soft sponge. They take some scraping off a rock … but we even saw them on the beaches,” he said. Sally Bunce, a seal rescue volunteer, has seen a sharp increase in emaciated grey seal pups – sometimes below their birth weight – washing ashore in recent months. Many have to be put down because they lack the blubber to survive at sea. At first, she attributed it to the aftermath of Storm Arwen, but is increasingly convinced it is linked to the loss of marine life. “We are just getting so many skinny pups. For me, there has to be a connection, because when they’re weaned off, they’re not skilled at chasing fish. So they’ll head to the bottom and they’ll scavenge on whatever’s in the inshore bottoms of the water, your crustaceans, your flatfish – and I know we’ve had a lot of flatfish washed up dead as well.” A multi-agency investigation coordinated by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), found “the deaths of the crabs and lobsters potentially resulted from a naturally occurring harmful algal bloom.” Amid concerns that the deaths could have been caused by contaminated sediment dredged from the River Tees and dumped into the ocean, Defra said it is “unlikely that chemical pollution, sewage or infectious aquatic animal diseases were the cause of the deaths”. An independent expert, commissioned by the North East Fishing collective, found evidence linking the deaths to pyridine. Defra’s conclusions were greeted by Tees Valley mayor, Ben Houchen, who said he hoped “it’s not too long before we see a positive changes along our coast.” The mayor said dredging work carried out last autumn was part of the required maintenance of the river, and was unconnected to the freeport. Work to deliver the South Bank Quay, part of the Teesworks freeport project, will continue. “Following extensive geotechnical and environmental analysis, including substantial sediment sampling which is ongoing around Teesworks, will include a programme of dredging.” Although fishers and seal conservationists are unlikely bedfellows, they are united in pushing for further investigation to ensure any future dredging is safe. “I’m not a scientist,” Bunce said, “but you’ve only got to think about the Tees – it has a hundred-year history of toxic industry, so you can’t say that that sediment is safe.” “None of us are against Teesport being made into a superport. Dredge it up, put in new quays for windmills, loads of jobs, blah blah blah. Just do it properly”, said Cole. “Levelling up? Great, but I don’t see why your environment has to get flattened to level something up,” he added.",News/Environment,‘My heart is broken’: death of marine life is devastating England’s fishing industry,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/10/my-heart-is-broken-death-of-marine-life-is-devastating-englands-fishing-industry
2/10/2022,"The number of in-person visits to public libraries plummeted by 159m last year, as the pandemic forced branches to close around the country. Annual figures from the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (Cipfa) show physical library visits fell from 214.6m to 59.7m in the year to March 2021, a drop of 72%, as Covid-19 restrictions shut branches for much of the 12-month period. The closures also led to a major decline in the number of books borrowed by readers, with 72.9m books issued by libraries last year, down 56% from 165.9m in 2020.  Unsurprisingly, the number of web visits grew – up by 18% to 154.7m over the period – as visitors unable to borrow physical books from their local branch turned to ebook borrowing instead. “Clearly, physical visits have dropped due to Covid-19 restrictions and the closure of library facilities. But, while this decline may be steep, the increase in digital visits shows that communities still want to use library services. Libraries continue to be of significant cultural value for our communities,” said Cipfa chief executive Rob Whiteman. “Only time will tell if this recent shift to digital will prove to be a long-term model for our use of libraries.” The Cipfa figures also reveal that the total income of libraries decreased by nearly £20m to £56.6m over the last financial year, a reduction of 25%. Librarian numbers remained relatively static, falling by 85 over the period, but volunteers – who have been instrumental in keeping some library services running in the face of government cuts – declined “sharply”, said Cipfa, down by almost 50% on the previous year to 25,709. ‘‘Given how stretched public services were during the pandemic, it’s not surprising to see such a sharp decline in libraries’ income, visitors and volunteer staff,” said Whiteman. “It’s worth noting that the reduced levels of income we’ve seen have occurred despite increases in specific grant funding. Without this additional grant funding, we would have expected to see lines of income even lower. The fiscal reality that libraries are facing is bleak.” At Cilip, the UK’s library and information association, chief executive Nick Poole called the latest figures “sobering”, pointing to new research by the University of Strathclyde showing that digital services cannot replace the benefits of physical library services. “Libraries have done life-changing work for their communities throughout the pandemic,” said Poole. “Local people continue to need and want quality local library services, and this continues to be a statutory duty for councils. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has made it clear that councils cannot use Covid disruption as a pretext for cuts to services, and that volunteers should not be used to replace paid professional staff.” Poole said Cilip would be working with the Local Government Association and others “to encourage them to return investment to pre-pandemic levels”. “But most importantly of all, instead of putting services at risk through successive cuts, as a society we ought to be far more ambitious on behalf of future generations,” he said. “As we look to recover from the pandemic and embrace new ways of working, we ought to be building more libraries as a vital part of levelling up.” Isobel Hunter, chief executive of the charity Libraries Connected noted that “libraries were not allowed by the government to fully reopen until April 2021, which is after this survey period, but since then the picture has changed dramatically.” The charity’s own surveys suggest that borrowing of physical books had returned to around 84% of pre-Covid levels by December 2021, although digital and audio borrowing have remained high, which “brings its own challenges to library budgets.” Hunter added “The pandemic also clearly demonstrated that the diverse needs of local people cannot be met by digital services alone. The current squeeze on local authority and household incomes mean that libraries will need even more support to continue to innovate for their communities online and in person.” One unexpected spark of good news in the Cipfa figures was the report that the number of library branches in the UK increased to 3,842 in 2021. The growth, from 3,662 branches recorded in the year to March 2020, follows years of decline, but Cipfa admitted it was based on “provisional” data, from authorities that have submitted their returns, and that “some figures may change once final data is released”. There has been a “slightly lower response rate” to the survey this year compared with previous years, because of the continued impact of the pandemic, said the organisation, but it is confident the figures “give an accurate snapshot of the library landscape in the UK at present”.",Arts/Books,"Library use plummeted in 2021, but e-visits showed 18% rise during lockdown",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/10/library-use-plummeted-in-2021-but-e-visits-showed-18-rise-during-lockdown
2/10/2022,"There is “compelling evidence” that British women and children currently detained in camps in north-east Syria were trafficked to the country against their will, according to a new parliamentary report. After a six-month inquiry by the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on trafficked Britons in Syria, the report published on Thursday highlights how systemic failures by UK public bodies enabled Islamic State trafficking of vulnerable women and children as young as 12.  About 20 British families remain detained in north-east Syria in camps controlled mainly by Kurdish-dominated groups. Investigations by the NGO Reprieve suggest that most of the British women detained are victims of trafficking based on evidence that they were subjected to sexual and other forms of exploitation and were either transported to Syria as children, coerced into travelling to Syria, or kept and moved within Syria against their will. During its inquiry, the APPG received evidence from a range of experts, including legal and anti-trafficking experts, current and former government officials from the UK and its allies, former police and prosecutors, and global security advisers. The APPG heard evidence of a “siloed approach to counter-terrorism and anti-trafficking by UK police and other authorities”. As a result, “key decision-makers failed to recognise signs of grooming and that vulnerable young girls were at risk of being lured out of the country by traffickers”. The report highlighted multiple missed opportunities to protect vulnerable women and children from being groomed by IS. In one instance, UK authorities initially prevented a child from leaving the country with an adult who was not a relative. Despite being sufficiently concerned to prevent their travel, the authorities did not inform the family of the incident. The child left the UK by a different route the day after. The family of the child believe that had the authorities contacted them at the time, they may have been able to prevent her from being transported to Syria. In another case, the police, school, health professionals and local authority were aware of evidence of domestic violence and knew that the girls in question had been taken out of school by their father unexpectedly. Yet investigations revealed that it was only a month after the girls had been taken to Syria that the local authority raised “safeguarding concerns” with the family’s GP and proceeded to complete a child missing education form. The UK’s refusal to repatriate the British families exacerbates the risk of re-trafficking, by forcing women to consider other means of escaping the camps, such as placing their lives and their children’s lives in the hands of unscrupulous smugglers and traffickers who may subject them to further exploitation. Despite these risks, the report found the UK government has refused to provide essential consular assistance and made no effort to establish whether British women and children in north-east Syria detention camps were victims of trafficking. Instead, it has implemented a policy of blanket stripping of citizenship on the grounds that women travelled to Syria of their own volition, when in fact many of the women were groomed, coerced or deceived into travelling. The APPG “heard first-hand from the families of those now detained in Syria about the devastating and discriminatory effects of these policies on their own sense of security and belonging within the UK. Many family members of those detained in Syria report feeling like second-class citizens as a result of the government’s response”, the report said. The APPG report concluded the UK government has failed to fulfil its obligations to identify, investigate, and protect potential victims of trafficking.",News/Global development,"British women and children detained in Syria failed by UK government, inquiry finds",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/10/british-women-and-children-detained-in-syria-failed-by-uk-government-inquiry-finds
2/10/2022,"“Ithink,” said my friend Dai, “there should be a tie amnesty.” In the course of a clearout, he was dismayed to find he had 30 ties in his collection, a count not much greater than the number of years since he’d last had cause to wear one. I remember my dad telling me, donkey’s years ago, that you knew were getting old when you bought yourself a black tie for funerals, instead of borrowing one from your old man. I passed that milestone a while ago. You know you’re really cracking on when you have 60 ties, but the black one is the only one you have any use for.  I thought I only had half as many, but I found more in a bag at the back of the wardrobe, waiting to be taken somewhere. But where? Who would want them? Charity shops must be sick of the sight of them. What is going to become of them all? The average length of a tie is, I read, 58 inches or just short of 1.5 metres. My collection alone, laid end to end, would stretch for 90 metres. Let’s say there are 30 million males in the UK – including all the tie-wearing schoolboys – and they have, on average, five ties each: that comes to well over 200,000km of ties. A use must be found for them. One reason that I have so many is that, being of Croatian heritage, I have always felt the need to boast about my country’s gift to the world. Natty neckties are first thought to have been sported by Croatian mercenaries serving for the French during the thirty years’ war of the 17th century. I love the idea of big Croatian brutes larging it around Paris in their small, traditional, knotted neckerchiefs, arousing the interest of Parisian fashionistas. “Très chic!” they must have cried. The Croats call themselves Hrváti; the French call them Croates. Conflate the two and you get cravat. C’est bon! Soon, Louis XIV was wearing one, and that was that. So I can’t possibly ditch my many Croatian ties. That would surely be treasonable and I’ve not long had my passport. As for the others in my collection, my television presenting career came at the end of the era in which tie-wearing was compulsory. I started out on a programme called Working Lunch on BBC Two in 1994, where the editor took the radical decision that we shouldn’t wear jackets. Traditionalists in the main newsroom were sniffy. Some took to calling the programme Naked Lunch rather than Working Lunch. Miseries. Heaven forfend if we’d also chosen to dispense with ties. Tellingly, this was never considered; there’s radical and then there’s radical. I have many ties from this era, none of which could be worn today without causing consternation. They are loud, they’re wide, they’re garish. They will never come back into fashion, if they ever were. Very few of the programmes I went on to present required me to wear a tie. The exception, oddly, was football. For some reason, televised football clung on to the tie longer than any part of the business, other than straight news bulletins. For a long while, absurdly, the only time I ever wore a tie was at football matches. And funerals, obviously. Now, it’s just the latter. Powerful forces seem determined to stop the rot. In January 2020, GQ declared: “It’s official – everyone is wearing ties again.” But then the pandemic happened and just about the only tie-wearers left in the land were Chris Whitty, Patrick Vallance and whichever government bod stood at the lectern between them. GQ hasn’t given up yet, though. Just last September, it asserted: “Men’s ties are bold, brash, and better than ever.” Like Croatian mercenaries, the tie-lovers fight on.

2/10/2022,"Good morning, Warren Murray pleased to present your Thursday news briefing.  All Covid regulations including isolation after testing positive are due to be abolished in England from Thursday 24 February, Boris Johnson has announced, moving the plan forward by a month. Downing Street confirmed people would be advised to avoid going to work if they tested positive for Covid – though without the current legal obligation and possible fines. Some scientists have warned it risks signalling the pandemic is “all over” while unions said the PM is “going too far, way too soon” and charities warned it could leave clinically vulnerable people exposed. Here is what the changes will mean for work, travel, isolation, testing, financial support and other issues where the pandemic has a bearing. Hannah Devlin, Guardian science correspondent, looks at the risks for controlling the impact of Omicron and other possible variants. As well, Guardian readers have shared their reactions to the decision, from calling it “laughably shortsighted” to “fully justified”. ‘Firm and united’ – Boris Johnson will be in Poland today before travelling to Brussels to meet the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, about the Ukraine crisis. Johnson is considering further deployments to eastern Europe. Keir Starmer will also visit Nato headquarters. Labour said he would send a “firm and united” message to allies – and to the Kremlin – in support of the UK government’s policy on Ukraine. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, is in Moscow to meet her Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, though her plan to have put the UK’s “toughest sanctions regime against Russia” on the statute book in time for the trip has fallen through. Labour contacts Met over reno-gate – Scotland Yard is considering whether to investigate Boris Johnson over the funding of his Downing Street flat renovation. Solicitors on behalf of Labour have written to the Met commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick, suggesting the force is “duty-bound” to begin a formal investigation because of a “reasonable suspicion” Johnson broke anti-bribery laws. They said the prime minister may have acted improperly by having “linked” a request for funds to cover the refurbishment works – which eventually cost at least £112,000 – with a promise to “promote a project” backed by the benefactor. A No 10 spokesperson called the allegations “categorically untrue” and a clear misrepresentation of the facts. It comes on top of the investigation into Downing Street lockdown parties, in which more than 50 people, possibly including the PM, are to face questions. Harry: as with Covid, get HIV test – Prince Harry has urged people to get tested for HIV, saying he hopes to carry on his mother’s work to tackle the virus. More must be done, said the Duke of Sussex, to make progress towards the UK goal of ending new HIV cases by 2030. Noting there had been a drop in HIV testing during Covid, he said that with people regularly testing for coronavirus, it should be “ingrained in us that that’s what we need to do, to know our status in order to be able to keep other people safe”. The former Welsh rugby captain Gareth Thomas, who lives with HIV, said that taking a test “wouldn’t be scary if you understood what living with HIV in 2022 is”. Of his own diagnosis, he said: “I take a moment at 6am … I take my HIV medication, which is one tablet, and I feel that my day then begins. I’m very active, I go to the gym, I work as hard as I possibly can.” Free HIV test kits to do at home can be ordered from www.startswithme.org.uk Longer lives ‘have to be paid for’ – Wealth taxes will be needed to fund a £76bn a year increase in government spending by the end of the decade, caused by an ageing population and more expensive healthcare, the Resolution Foundation says. The thinktank argues previous ways of raising money – such as reducing defence spending and raising national insurance contributions – will no longer be feasible. Dan Tomlinson, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “We’ll all benefit from people living longer, healthier lives – as well as reducing our carbon footprint – but it will have to be paid for.” Hawking blackboard on show – Stephen Hawking’s blackboard goes on display today as part of a collection of office items acquired by the Science Museum in London. The Cambridge cosmologist, who died in 2018 at the age of 76, treasured a blackboard that became smothered with cartoons, doodles and equations at a conference on superspace and supergravity that he arranged in 1980. What all the graffiti and in-jokes mean is taking some time to unravel, so curators are hoping surviving attendees of that conference will drop by to explain. The temporary display called Stephen Hawking at Work includes his 1966 PhD thesis, his wheelchair, and a host of memorabilia including a jacket from the Simpsons, which he appeared on many times. Gavin Barwell was in No 10 when Tory MPs were plotting the downfall of his boss, Theresa May. Now, as Boris Johnson’s premiership hangs in the balance, he tells Nosheen Iqbal what it’s like on the inside when things start falling apart.

As debate rages over what to do with the huge empty site, the city is becoming a test case for where Britain’s urban centres may be heading. At the Winter Olympics, the Team GB’s women’s curling team have played their first game of the day, which Switzerland won 6-5. The men will play Italy before the women return against Sweden. Matt Weston sat tied for 13th after today’s skeleton, and Huw Nightingale is competing in the snowboardcross. The American snowboarder Chloe Kim has become the first woman to successfully defend the Olympic halfpipe title, while compatriot Nathan Chen has won gold in men’s figure skating. Keep up with all the action at our live blog. Tottenham fluffed their lines against Southampton. They would get nothing in the 3-2 loss, which was what they deserved, in the first serious misstep of Conte’s Premier League tenure. Rather like Aston Villa, swashbuckling their way into a 3-1 lead before dipping away to allow Leeds to battle back for a draw, Steven Gerrard built up Jacob Ramsey’s candidature for an England call-up before asking us all to stay calm and let him develop. Manchester City seem intent on making their title defence a procession. After a 2-0 defeat of Brentford their lead is now 12 points and though Liverpool can cut it back to nine by beating Leicester on Thursday, Pep Guardiola’s team have a relentlessness that may soon propel them far into the distance. Joe Marler has revealed “in-house bitching” is becoming a thing of the past within the England squad after holding his hands up for how he choked during his costly lineout clanger in the defeat by Scotland. Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad are insisting their omission from England’s squad to tour West Indies next month is “not the end of the road” and are focused on forcing their way back into the Test side, according to Andrew Strauss. Simone Biles and Lindsey Vonn are among the US sports stars who have thrown their support behind Mikaela Shiffrin as the American Alpine skiing star’s nightmarish start to the Winter Games continues. Shipping costs are soaring for British businesses as the supply chain problems convulsing the world economy continue to bear down on consumers. Pickering’s Gin saw the cost of shipping glass bottles from China rise sixfold last year and although it has come down a bit, it’s still four times more expensive than pre-pandemic. The FTSE100 is looking flat this morning, as is the pound at $1.353 and €1.184 ahead of US inflation data later. The Guardian’s front page today has “Covid rules to be abolished in England in a fortnight”. Also the story of the man who murdered two partners – after Ian Stewart was arrested for killing his fiancee in 2016, it was discovered his first wife had also died at his hands six years earlier. Stewart, 61, has been jailed on a whole-life order. The Times says “PM among 50 set to be questioned by police” about partygate. A picture of the PM with an “open bottle of bubbly” is on the front of the Metro and the headline is “Cops’ quiz question”, referring to a “Downing Street Christmas quiz” that took place. The i’s wording is “Police quiz Johnson and 50 staff for partying in lockdown”. The Mirror has the quiz picture on the front though its main story is about Coleen and Wayne Rooney’s marriage. The Telegraph says “Police to contact fifty No10 partygoers”. As on some other fronts, Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, is shown taking a photo-op in front of colourful scenery in Moscow where she is to meet her Russian counterpart about the Ukraine crisis. It’s a happy day for the Daily Mail: “England tears up Covid rules – and leads the world”. The Express is also gleeful and cries “Freedom!” And the top story in the Financial Times is “US regulator moves to strengthen disclosure rules for private equity funds”; while a big moment in fusion power research is summed up as having produced enough power to “boil 60 kettles”.
