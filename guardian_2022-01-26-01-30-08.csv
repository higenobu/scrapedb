1/26/2022,"Olavo de Carvalho, the coronavirus-denying mentor of Jair Bolsonaro and Brazil’s radical right, has died in the United States, with one of his children citing Covid-19 as the cause. “The family … asks for prayers for the professor’s soul,” relatives said on Twitter after announcing the passing of the 74-year-old polemicist – a towering figure in contemporary Brazilian politics who was adored and abhorred in equal measure by millions of followers and foes.  The statement did not say how Carvalho – a former astrologer who repeatedly trivialized Covid as the “moronavirus” – had died. However, his estranged daughter, Heloísa de Carvalho, said coronavirus was the cause. “He has blood on his hands,” she told the magazine Veja, blaming her father’s “denialist ideas” and dissemination of fake news for the Brazilian government’s delay in purchasing Covid vaccines. “But I do not celebrate his death.” Bolsonaro – whose shock 2018 election was turbocharged by Carvalho’s extreme and often expletive-ridden teachings – lamented the loss of “one of the greatest thinkers in our country’s history”. “Olavo was a … beacon for millions of Brazilians,” Brazil’s ultraconservative president claimed. The president’s son, Eduardo, also celebrated the pipe-smoking septuagenarian whose influence was such that he reputedly named several members of Bolsonaro’s cabinet despite having lived in the US since 2005. Progressive Brazilians – disgusted by the leading role they claim Carvalho played in poisoning their country’s social and political life and spreading life-threatening misinformation about Covid – rejected such eulogies. Before his death Carvalho continually minimized coronavirus – which has killed nearly 625,000 Brazilians and 5.6m people globally – peddled conspiracies about its origins, and attacked those trying to slow its spread. It is unclear if he had been vaccinated. In May 2020, as Covid pummeled South America, Carvalho tweeted: “The fear of a supposedly deadly virus is nothing more than a little horror story designed to scare the population and make them accept slavery as they would a present from Father Christmas”. Carvalho branded containment measures “the most enormous and sordid crime ever committed against the entire human species” and once alleged the global health emergency “simply doesn’t exist”. On another occasion he said only “a perfect fool” would believe the spread of the “Chinese virus” was accidental. “Does the moronavirus really kill people or does he just help them become statistics?” he wondered last January as Brazil’s death toll rose to over 200,000. When Twitter deleted one of Carvalho’s posts for violating its rules on spreading harmful or misleading information about Covid, he told the company’s then president Jack Dorsey: “You can stick your network up your” buttocks. Felipe Neto, one of Brazil’s top online influencers, tweeted: “The far-right will now try to turn Olavo de Carvalho into a martyr, a hero. Olavo is one of the main culprits for the sea of mud into which we have sunk.” Journalist André Fran wrote: “My condolences to all those whose relatives have fallen victim to the Bolsonarista hatred and denialism that Olavo did so much to a disseminate.” Carvalho’s daughter also had harsh words for her father, who was reportedly diagnosed with Covid on 16 January. “May God forgive him all the evil he has done,” she tweeted, recalling losing a friend to Covid on the day her father falsely claimed the world had not seen a single confirmed death. “She was a widower and left three orphaned children under the age of 10.” Brian Winter, a Brazil specialist who interviewed Carvalho at his rifle-filled Virginia home, said Bolsonaro’s guru had helped import “a kind of tropicalized Fox News culture focused on gender, guns and anti-globalism”. Winter said during the first decade of this century – as Brazil flourished under the leftist government of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva – Carvalho was widely considered a “crazy crank”. However, during the 2010s, as the country sunk into profound recession and political turmoil, his intellectual-sounding “profanity-laced vitriol” against the left suddenly gained traction. Bookshops sold hundreds of thousands of copies of his most famous work, The Least You Must Know to Avoid Being an Idiot – a tome Bolsonaro promoted after winning power. Winter remembered first seeing Carvalho’s name at a 2013 anti-government protest on a poster reading: “Olavo was right”. “He and Bolsonaro were products of the titanic trauma that Brazil endured during the 2010s: the worst recession in a hundred years, the collapse of the political establishment, corruption scandals everywhere you looked, 70,000 homicides a year. Out of this despair, he and Bolsonaro happened to emerge as the winners because they sounded so radically different from anything that happened before. That was their appeal.” Many believe that appeal is now fading, with former president Lula seemingly poised to trounce Bolsonaro in October’s election. “Part of the struggle Bolsonaro is having now is that he’s still going around talking about gun rights and gender and these other Olavista ideas in a Brazil where people just want solutions to the pandemic, hunger and unemployment,” Winter said. “Bolsonaro is playing the Olavista oldies and most Brazilians want to be hearing something else.”",News/World news,"Covid ‘denialist’ and Bolsonaro ally Olavo de Carvalho died of virus, says daughter",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/25/covid-denialist-bolsonaro-ally-olavo-de-carvalho-dies-coronavirus
1/26/2022,"At least four people have died and dozens are missing after strong winds and heavy downpours wreaked havoc in Malawi and Mozambique as Tropical Storm Ana made landfall on Monday. Almost 16,000 people in the south of Malawi have been affected, according to the Red Cross, as search and rescue operations continue after the first cyclone of the region’s season. At least two people were killed and 66 injured in Mozambique on Monday and a further two people died on Tuesday in Malawi.  Felix Washon of the Malawi Red Cross Society said people were sheltering in schools-turned-evacuation centres as the organisation rushed to provide survivors with basic necessities, including shelter, food, kitchen utensils, water buckets and washing facilities such as toilets and clean water, adding that they are running short on supplies. “The rains are still coming and the water levels are still rising, meaning more people are going to be affected. Roads are impassable and there are fears that some places might not be reachable,” he said. Heavy flooding has forced the main hydropower supplier to shut down, and much of the country is still without electricity. The Electricity Generation Company of Malawi said in a statement: “We are experiencing flash floods in the power station. As such, we have been forced to shut down some machines to protect the intake structure from damage.” Eveness Masanjala, 47, who lives in Mulanje, southern Malawi, was forced to run with her children on Monday evening when water surrounded her house. Along with dozens of others, she is now being given shelter by neighbouring villagers. “The water just came abruptly and I managed to grab my children and run,” she said. “I’m not sure what remains in the house as it’s submerged in the water. There is fertiliser, poultry, cash for farming and everything.” Dr Victor Mithi, president of Malawi’s Society of Medical Doctors, said the electricity blackout is dangerous. “At the moment most hospitals don’t have power apart from those that depend on fuel. If you think of all the small health centres and small community hospitals – they completely don’t have any source of power. This is very dangerous because if you think of patients that need oxygen therapy, they cannot be assisted. Those babies born prematurely may not be in proper nursery care because there is no power. Drugs that have to be kept at a specific temperature may not be there. We’re not sure when this might end, but we might lose lives.” The Malawi Department of Disaster Management Affairs said on Tuesday that the cyclone made landfall over Nampula province in Mozambique the day before, after crossing from Madagascar. “Councils are conducting assessments to establish the extent of damage and assisting all those in need. Meanwhile, the department has deployed a search and rescue team,” said a statement by Charles Kalemba, Malawi’s commissioner for disaster management. The Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services advised Malawians to move to higher ground and avoid crossing flooded rivers and streams. Southern African countries have been repeatedly struck by severe storms and cyclones in recent years, which experts say are worsening as waters warm due to the climate emergency.",News/Global development,At least four killed after tropical Storm Ana hits Malawi and Mozambique,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/25/at-least-four-killed-after-tropical-storm-ana-hits-malawi-and-mozambique
1/26/2022,"The fire that ripped through Glasgow School of Art’s Mackintosh building in 2018 was so fierce and all-consuming that the cause can never be known conclusively, according to a long-awaited report. The art school said it “shared the frustration” that the exact cause of the fire, which destroyed the iconic Grade A-listed building as it neared the end of a £35m restoration project following an earlier blaze in May 2014, had not been identified in the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) report, published on Tuesday.  The report stated that, after the most complex and resource-intensive investigation ever undertaken by the service, involving more than 172 weeks of excavation and examination of hundreds of tonnes of debris along with careful analysis of witness testimonies, CCTV and photographic footage, the cause of the fire has been recorded as “undetermined”. But it also noted that wilful fire raising and electrical failure could not be “fully discounted”. Paul Sweeney, Scottish Labour MSP for Glasgow and board member of the Glasgow City Heritage Trust, said he was “appalled” at the time taken for progress to be made both on the investigation and restoration plans, adding that the report was “hardly worth the wait and tells us nothing we couldn’t have deduced from a cursory glance at aerial photographs”. According to the report, the building was so badly damaged by the fire that complex engineering works had to be carried out initially to stabilise and make safe the remaining structure before investigators could access the site. They discovered that much of the physical evidence which could have provided clues, such as the Fire Warning System (FWS) control panel and the CCTV hard drive, had been so badly damaged that they could provide no data. An investigation into the May 2014 fire, which reported in November that year, found that the first blaze began when flammable gases from a foam canister used in a student project were ignited. In September 2018, three months after the second fire, a Holyrood inquiry heard criticism of “systemic failures” on the part of the art school’s management. Penny Macbeth, director of the Glasgow School of Art and Kristen Bennie, interim chair of the GSA board of governors, said that they “share the frustration that many will feel that the exact cause of the fire has not been identified”, but thanked the SFRS for its “meticulous” approach. They added that the report was an important milestone in the progress of their Mackintosh Project, outlined last October, which will see the “faithful reinstatement” of the Mack building, although it is not expected to be back in use for at least six years. Sweeney urged the GSA to act quickly now: “Three years on and it is still not clear when are contracts going to be awarded, is it financed, will the insurance pay out, are we appointing people to get this back on track? “This is the single biggest disaster to hit Scotland’s built heritage in a century and lack of pace and grip shown by the authorities from the School of Art itself to the Scottish government has been nothing short of disgraceful.”",Arts/Art and design,Cause of fire that destroyed Glasgow School of Art ‘will never be known’,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/25/cause-of-fire-that-destroyed-glasgow-school-of-art-will-never-be-known
1/26/2022,"What some call science fiction, I prefer to call science possible or sometimes science probable. One branch of sci-fi is based on imagined technological or scientific advances, and major social or environmental changes. It was that branch that I embraced when I wrote Pig Heart Boy. I loved the idea of exploring xenotransplantation through the eyes of Cameron, a 13-year-old boy with a bad heart who just wants to live. I found the whole notion of transplanting organs from one species into another fascinating and the perfect subject matter for a children’s book. Now I hasten to add that I’m not a scientist or expert on xenotransplantation, nor do I claim to be. I’m a layperson with a love of science who occasionally reads science magazines. My approach was from an author’s angle, spending months on research before writing a single word.  So where did I get the idea? Whenever I attend a literary or school event, that question is invariably asked. For Pig Heart Boy, the answer is simple. Back in the mid 1990s, I read a newspaper article written by a doctor who speculated that we would eventually have to turn to xenotransplantation as a possible solution to the lack of human organ donors. The article considered the pros and cons of mechanical hearts versus xenotransplantation, and suggested that for xenotransplantation to be successful, gene editing would have to be employed. This would mean the introduction of human DNA into animal embryos to reduce the chance of organ rejection. For the recent pig heart transplant that took place on 7 January, scientists also altered 10 genes in the donor pig, again to lessen the chance of the heart being rejected. And if the bio-sealed environment in which the pigs live allows them to lead a reasonable free-range life, does that mitigate the fact that these genetically modified animals are being purposely bred as organ donors? In the case of heart transplants, for a human to live a pig must die. Of course, every year approximately 10 million pigs are bred and slaughtered in the UK for their meat alone. When I read that article in the 1990s, it left my mind buzzing with questions. What were the ramifications? Do we really have the right to treat animals as mere organ repositories for humans? Is it OK because they are already farmed for food? So I headed to my nearest bookshop and bought all the books I could on heart transplants in particular, and transplant operations in general. I’ve found questions are one of the best places to start from when writing a novel. In my story Cameron, who needs a heart transplant, knows he is unlikely to see his next birthday unless he receives one, but he is a long way down the waiting list. When a genetically modified pig’s heart is offered by a pioneering doctor, Cameron decides to go for it – and his new heart completely changes his life in unexpected ways. Now some people might think that the subject matter is not suitable for children. I completely disagree. As a children’s author, it never ceases to amaze me how some adults underestimate what subject matter will interest and stimulate children and teens. I wanted to write a story that provided no right or wrong answers, but which would provide food for thought and discussion. A story that would allow the reader to walk in Cameron’s shoes for a while and think about what decisions they would make and how they would react if they too were faced with his dilemma. I believe the best stories encourage children to think for themselves. Fictional stories that explore new ideas when it comes to STEM subjects also have a part to play in enriching our children’s reading and learning. Various studies have shown that reading fiction enhances our children’s ability to grasp new concepts and as such has cross-curriculum benefits. Pig Heart Boy was my attempt to incorporate science possible into a believable, thought-provoking story. So now that science fiction has become science fact, do I feel that maybe the time is right to return to Cameron and his family in a sequel?

1/26/2022,"Like a sad, greedy king in some fairytale or parable, the Georgian billionaire and former prime minister Bidzina Ivanishvili set out, six years ago, to buy and uproot hundreds of magnificent mature trees and transport them at colossal expense and difficulty across Georgia to be transplanted in his own huge private garden. It sometimes involves taking a tree by water, along the Black Sea coast – a truly surreal image.  Salomé Jashi’s fascinating and deadpan film shows, in a series of tableau-type shots, the effect that these purchases are having up and down the land. Local workers squabble among themselves at the dangerous, strenuous, but nonetheless lucrative job of digging them up. The landowners and communities brood on the sizeable sums of money they are getting paid and Ivanishvili’s promises that roads will also be built. But at the moment of truth, they are desolate when the Faustian bargain must be settled and the huge, ugly haulage trucks come to take their trees away in giant “pots” of earth, as if part of their natural soul is being confiscated. (Surely at least some of these trees will have died en route, although this is not revealed.) Whole villages are clearly in the throes of emotions they cannot understand: angry, upset, yet also weirdly elated at the undoubtedly extraordinary spectacle that they have facilitated – a Birnam Wood coming to Ivanishvili’s exclusive Dunsinane. Transporting these trees is a Fitzcarraldo-type operation: a folie de grandeur of staggering proportions. And finally, far from the remote villages from which the trees have been abducted, sometimes in darkness (perhaps to avoid mass protests from those suffering seller’s remorse) we see the strange private garden that the oligarch has built, with its trees and manicured lawns. The whole country is the real garden which he has attempted to subdue, reducing it to the tamed sterility of private property.

1/26/2022,"Doctors have discovered an “antibody signature” that can help identify patients most at risk of developing long Covid, a condition where debilitating symptoms of the disease can persist for many months. Researchers at University hospital Zurich analysed blood from Covid patients and found that low levels of certain antibodies were more common in those who developed long Covid than in patients who swiftly recovered.  When combined with the patient’s age, details of their Covid symptoms and whether or not they had asthma, the antibody signature allowed doctors to predict whether people had a moderate, high or very high risk of developing long-term illness. “Overall, we think that our findings and identification of an immunoglobulin signature will help early identification of patients that are at increased risk of developing long Covid, which in turn will facilitate research, understanding and ultimately targeted treatments for long Covid,” said Onur Boyman, a professor of immunology who led the research. The team studied 175 people who tested positive for Covid and 40 healthy volunteers who acted as a control group. To see how their symptoms changed over time, doctors followed 134 of the Covid patients for up to a year after their initial infection. Blood tests on the participants showed that those who developed long Covid – also known as post-acute Covid-19 syndrome (Pacs) – tended to have low levels of the antibodies IgM and IgG3. When Covid strikes, IgM ramps up rapidly, while IgG antibodies rise later and provide longer-term protection. The scientists combined the antibody signature with the patient’s age, whether they had asthma and details of their symptoms to produce a long Covid risk score. To confirm that the score was useful, they ran the test on a separate group of 395 Covid patients that had been followed up for six months. The test cannot predict a person’s risk of long Covid before they are infected because details of their symptoms are needed, but Dr Carlo Cervia, the first author on the study, said people with asthma and low IgM and IgG3 levels beforehand could assume they were at an increased risk. “This is expected to improve care for long Covid patients as well as motivate high-risk groups, such as asthmatic patients, to get vaccinated and thus prevent long Covid,” Cervia said. The research is published in Nature Communications. Although there is no effective cure for long Covid, being able to work out who is most at risk could help doctors direct patients to clinical trials for long Covid therapies and arrange early rehabilitation. Better control of the infection through antibody treatments, antivirals and anti-inflammatory drugs, may all help to reduce the risk and vaccines can sometimes alleviate long Covid symptoms, but more studies are needed. Another hope is that early identification of long Covid patients will help doctors work out what causes the condition in particular people. Researchers have proposed several possible drivers, from long-term damage wrought by the virus to a misfiring immune system and pockets of virus hiding out in the body. Dr Claire Steves, a clinical senior lecturer at King’s College London, welcomed the work but said it was important to replicate the findings in a larger number of patients. With cases still high, she added, many more people were at risk of developing long-term symptoms. “We urgently need to scale up research on how to prevent this happening,” she said. Dr David Strain, a clinical senior lecturer at the University of Exeter medical school and the British Medical Association’s lead on long Covid, said the study was a step towards better understanding long Covid. The antibody signature identified by the Swiss researchers was similar to that seen in myalgic encephalomyelitis, or ME, he said, a condition that affects a quarter of a million people across the UK. “Further comparisons between these diseases may allow mutual benefit and cross-pollination of ideas as the learnings from each benefit the other,” he said.",News/Society,Long Covid: doctors find ‘antibody signature’ for patients most at risk,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/25/doctors-find-antibody-signature-long-covid
1/26/2022,"Descendants of the last king of Italy have made their first formal request to reclaim the crown jewels, which for almost 76 years have been stashed in a treasure chest in a safety deposit box at the Bank of Italy amid a long-running mystery over their ownership. The bank took delivery of the jewels, comprising more than 6,000 diamonds and 2,000 pearls mounted on brooches and necklaces worn by various queens and princesses, on 5 June 1946, three days after Italians voted to abolish the monarchy and nine days before King Umberto II, who ruled for just 34 days, was banished into exile along with his male heirs.  Umberto II had tasked Falcone Lucifero, the minister of the Royal House, to bring the jewels to Luigi Einaudi, the then governor of Bank of Italy who later became president, for safekeeping. The jewels are said to have been the only part of the royal estate that were not confiscated by the Italian state after the monarchy was scrapped, an element that might help the descendants of the House of Savoy, including Umberto II’s son, Vittorio Emanuele di Savoia, and three daughters, Maria Gabriella, Maria Pia and Maria Beatrice, win back possession. The family is also hoping that a cryptic note delivered alongside the treasure chest, which said the “precious” crown jewels must be “entrusted to the custody of the central cashier” and “kept at the disposal of those who have right”, will help determine that the jewels belong to them and not the state. Sergio Orlandi, the family’s lawyer, told the Corriere della Sera newpaper: “The Savoy family will get the jewels back.” The first “mediation meeting” between Orlandi and representatives of the Bank of Italy and the Italian government to discuss the family’s claim is taking place on Tuesday. If the parties fail to reach a solution, the family will proceed with suing the state in their attempt to repossess the jewels, according to Corriere. An informal request was already rejected by the Bank of Italy in November. “The [request for] return cannot be accepted, taking into account the responsibilities of the depositary,” lawyers for the bank reportedly said. Until now, the family had never taken any formal action to repossess the jewels over fears they might fuel a wave of resentment. It wasn’t until 2002 that the male descendants of the House of Savoy were allowed to reenter Italy. Before returning from exile in Switzerland in 2003, Vittorio Emanuele said he would not lay claim to the crown jewels, adding that “they are no longer ours”. However, he hoped the jewels would be put on public display. In 2006, a politician in the Piedmont region reached out to Mario Draghi, Italy’s current prime minister who at the time was governor of the Bank of Italy, asking if the jewels could be displayed at an exhibition being held as part of the winter Olympic Games in Turin, the northern Italian city that hosted the royal palace. Draghi in turn asked the government, but the jewels were never displayed. Another factor that could support the family’s case is that the jewels are said to have been either given as gifts to various royals or were personal purchases, as opposed to being given to the family to wear for official functions over the years of the monarchy. It is unclear how much the gems are worth, although wildly disparate estimates of €18m and €300m have been given in the past. Umberto II spent his exile years in Portugal, never setting foot in Italy again. He died aged 78 in Geneva, where he was being treated for cancer, in 1983.",News/World news,Descendants of Italy’s last king attempt to reclaim crown jewels,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/25/descendants-of-italys-last-king-attempt-to-reclaim-crown-jewels

Lisa Smith, 39, from Dundalk, County Louth, has pleaded not guilty to being a member of the terrorist organisation between October 2015 and December 2019.  Opening the case on Tuesday in the special criminal court, the prosecutor, Sean Gillane, said the former Irish Defence Forces soldier had “enveloped” herself in the “black flag of Islamic State” and had “tried to access Islamic State-controlled territory and sought out the means in which this could be done”. The court was told she had gone to the self-declared IS caliphate in 2015, where she married and had a child. Gillane said she then fled with the group as it lost territory before eventually ending up in a refugee camp, from where she was repatriated and subsequently arrested on arrival in Ireland. The prosecutor said the case against Smith was not about religion, and that she was not accused of using arms during her time in Syria. He said that membership of the organisation could be adduced by her association, state of mind and allegiance to the IS leadership. The court was told Smith had converted to Islam in 2011 and left the Irish forces after being refused permission to wear a hijab. Gillane said she became an administrator on an online group called We hear, we obey, which hosted online discussions about jihad and women’s obligations. The court was told she lied to her family about her trip to Raqqa in Syria. The case is expected to continue for 12 weeks.

1/26/2022,"Serbian authorities have extradited a Bahraini dissident in cooperation with Interpol despite an injunction by the European court of human rights, in the first test for the international policing organisation under the presidency of a top Emirati security official. Authorities in Belgrade approved the extradition of Ahmed Jaafar Mohamed Ali to Bahrain earlier this week. Days earlier the ECHR had issued an injunction saying the extradition should be postponed until after 25 February to allow Serbian authorities time to provide more information to the court, which was responding to a request by the Belgrade Centre for Human Rights to consider Ali’s case.  The court also asked for further evidence from the Serbian authorities about the case and warned that failure to comply meant that Serbia risked breaching the European convention on human rights. Ali’s lawyers claimed that a judge in Belgrade informed the Serbian authorities and Interpol about the ruling last Sunday. He was extradited to Bahrain in the early hours of Monday morning on a charter flight by Royal Jet, a private Emirati airline headed by a member of the ruling family of Abu Dhabi. The Bahraini interior ministry hailed Ali’s deportation as a “joint operation between member countries of the International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol),” and said he was “arrested after coordination and communication with a friendly country.” Ali’s extradition represents the first case of its kind since Maj Gen Ahmed Naser al-Raisi, a leading Emirati security official, was elected to the presidency of Interpol. Raisi, who oversaw the Emirati detention system, was accused by former detainees of complicity in torture amid growing concern that his election could also embolden authoritarian regimes’ abuse of Interpol’s structures to arrest dissidents overseas. Earlier this month, a complaint containing new allegations of torture was filed against Raisi in France after he visited Interpol’s headquarters in Lyon for the first time as president. None of the complaints have resulted in any formal proceedings against the general. Interpol is a supranational police force providing investigational support to its member states, including sharing information on suspects via its red notice system. Its critics have accused the organisation of allowing anti-democratic regimes to abuse the red notice system by flagging political dissidents for arrest. “The fact that Interpol proceeded with this extradition to Bahrain despite knowing they were violating a direct decision from the European court of human rights prohibiting Ahmed’s return sends a devastating message that, under Al-Raisi’s leadership, red lines will be crossed,” said Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei of the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy. “This scandal has unfolded on his watch, and Interpol will now be complicit in any abuse faced by Ali.” Ali was arrested in Belgrade in November on the basis of a red notice issued in 2015 at the request of Bahrain. He previously sought asylum in Serbia fearing that he would be tortured on return, as he personally described in a 2010 report by Human Rights Watch on the use of torture in the kingdom. The 48-year-old was sentenced to life in prison in absentia in 2013 for alleged terrorist activities including bomb making. Rights groups have accused the Bahraini authorities of using similar charges against anti-government protesters in order to suppress dissent following mass protests that gripped Bahrain in 2011. Ali was also named in 2015 as one of 10 defendants in a separate case over the killing of an Emirati police officer, where three of his co-defendants were executed by firing squad two years later. The United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings Agnés Callamard and special rapporteur on torture Nils Melzer accused the Bahraini authorities of relying on false confessions and evidence obtained under torture in the case, as well as denying the accused access to legal assistance. Callamard later condemned the executions as “extrajudicial killings”, following what she called an “unfair trial and flimsy evidence”. A spokesperson for the Bahraini government said Ali was not at risk of mistreatment. “As with all inmates in Bahrain, he will have his legal rights guaranteed and will be able to pursue proceedings in accordance with due legal process,” they said.

1/26/2022,"Nvidia is becoming increasingly resigned to giving up on its $40bn takeover of Cambridge-based chip designer Arm, as regulatory hurdles and industry opposition mounts, making it almost certain that the two-year time frame the companies aimed to complete the deal in will expire. The contentious deal, the largest ever in the semiconductor industry, has become mired in seemingly insurmountable regulatory red tape on both sides of the Atlantic as well as in China since being announced in September 2020.  Executives at US-based Nvidia have reportedly expressed serious doubts that the deal will be closed, while SoftBank, the Japanese owner of Arm, has rekindled plans to float Arm as an alternative to a sale, according to Bloomberg. Nvidia, and Arm, continue to pursue regulatory clearance while the initial deal terms are set to expire on 13 September, a date by which the parties now cannot hope to gain clearance. “We remain hopeful that the transaction will be approved,” said a spokesman for SoftBank. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) dealt the most recent blow to the prospect of a successful takeover, launching legal action in December to block what it called an “illegal vertical merger” that would give Nvidia too much market power. Despite the mounting opposition to the takeover of Arm – which many of its 500 clients, which range from Apple and Samsung to Qualcomm, say would end the company’s status as the “Switzerland” of the semiconductor industry – Nvidia continues to expound the benefits of the deal. “We continue to hold the views expressed in detail in our latest regulatory filings,” said Bob Sherbin, spokesman for Nvidia. “This transaction provides an opportunity to accelerate Arm and boost competition and innovation.” Arm, which employs 6,500 staff including 3,000 in the UK, declined to comment. The increasingly severe global shortage of chips – the “brain” within every electronic device, from smartphones and cars to aviation and smart TVs – has increased takeover activity and increased scrutiny on deals in the now geo-politically sensitive sector.

Higuera’s novel, her second, tells the story of Petra Peña, whose family is chosen to travel to a new planet when Earth is destroyed by a comet. When she wakes up, hundreds of years later, she finds she is the only person to remember Earth, after a “sinister Collective” has taken over the ship, purging the memories of those on board. “Petra alone now carries the stories of our past, and with them, any hope for our future. Can she make them live again?” says publisher Levine Querido, an independent press. “I have pinched myself, squeezed my eyes super tight, and it’s all still real life! What a day! Taking a minute to digest over here,” said Higuera on learning of her win. The awards, which are run by the American Library Association, also saw the Caldecott medal for the illustrator of the most distinguished American picture book for children go to Jason Chin’s Watercress. The picture book, which was written by Andrea Wang, tells the story of a child of Chinese immigrants who stop off while driving through Ohio to harvest watercress they see growing wild. At first, the girl is embarrassed, but changes her mind when her mother tells her a story about the family’s time in China. “Speechless. Honored. Overjoyed,” tweeted Chin on learning of his win. Wang congratulated him. “I can’t express how much I wanted [Jason Chin] to win the Caldecott. His incredible, luminous, exquisite art not only brought the story to life but also brought lost family back to me,” she said. Watercress also won the Asian Pacific American award for best picture book at Monday’s ceremony.",Arts/Books,Donna Barba Higuera wins top US children’s book award for The Last Cuentista,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/25/donna-barba-higuera-wins-top-us-childrens-book-award-for-the-last-cuentista-newbery-medal
