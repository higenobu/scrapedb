4/3/2022,"(Reuters) -The world's first ""human challenge"" trial in which volunteers were deliberately exposed to the coronavirus has found that symptoms had no effect on how likely an infected person is to pass the disease on to others. The findings underscore the difficulty in preventing community infections as the Word Health Organization (WHO) warns of a rise in cases. The research project, run by Open Orphan with Imperial College, London, showed that among the 18 participants that caught COVID-19, the severity of symptoms, or whether they developed symptoms at all, had nothing to do with the viral load in their airways. The viral load, or tendency to shed the virus, was measured by two methods known as focus-forming assay (FFA) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). ""There was no correlation between the amount of viral shedding by qPCR or FFA and symptom score,"" the researchers said in paper published by scientific journal Nature Medicine. The Imperial trial exposed 36 healthy young adults without a history of infection or vaccination to the original SARS-CoV-2 strain of the virus and monitored them in a quarantined setting. Since two volunteers were found to have had antibodies against the virus after all, they were excluded from the analysis. Slightly more than half of them contracted the virus. No serious adverse events occurred, and the human challenge study model was shown to be safe and well tolerated in healthy young adults, the research team had said earlier this year.

4/3/2022,"Jack Dorsey said ""centralizing discovery and identity into corporations really damaged the internet."" The Twitter founder, who resigned as CEO in November, said he partially blamed himself. Dorsey has previously supported efforts to decentralize the internet. Twitter founder Jack Dorsey said on Saturday he partially blames himself for the state of the internet today. ""The days of usenet, irc, the web...even email (w PGP)...were amazing,"" Dorsey said in a tweet, referring to certain online communication systems that date back to the early days of the internet. ""Centralizing discovery and identity into corporations really damaged the internet."" ""I realize I'm partially to blame, and regret it,"" Dorsey continued. Dorsey, who co-founded Twitter in 2006 and served as its CEO before resigning in November, has previously supported decentralizing the internet. After Twitter banned former President Donald Trump from the platform for violating its rules, Dorsey said he felt the action set ""a precedent I feel is dangerous: the power an individual or corporation has over a part of the global public conversation."" While Dorsey was still CEO, Twitter funded Bluesky, a decentralized social media system he said would allow for more conversations. The system, which will take years to develop, is intended to put power back into the hands of users and allow for many different social networks to be created.
