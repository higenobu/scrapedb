1/6/2022,"When dozens of apparently healthy young men who had emigrated from Laos started dying in their sleep in the late 1970s, US medical authorities couldn’t fathom what was going on. They termed the phenomenon “sudden unexpected nocturnal death syndrome”, but that was just a label for their bafflement. Today, we think we know the cause: the men experienced sleep paralysis, which is common and harmless in itself; but they understood it as a visitation from the dab tsog, a malevolent spirit who sits on victims’ chests at night. Living far from the shamans and family members who might have helped them ward off the evil, the men panicked, probably exacerbating a form of heart arrhythmia more prevalent in people from south-east Asia, and triggering cardiac arrest. The science writer David Robson’s mission in The Expectation Effect is to convince us we shouldn’t look on those men with condescending pity: our own expectations and beliefs, however irrational, influence our health, happiness and our survival no less decisively. Take, for example, ageing: if you think it’s a matter of inevitable cognitive decline and becoming useless to society, you’re more likely to experience hearing loss, frailty, even Alzheimer’s. Such attitudes predict higher levels of stress and inflammation, which in turn contribute to a range of disorders. (By contrast, in places such as Sardinia, where centenarians are numerous and thriving, their role in intergenerational households is thought to be a factor: it encourages them to expect to stay active.) If you convince yourself that you’re prone to insomnia, you’ll suffer the symptoms of insomnia – even if the truth is that you sleep fairly well. And it’s common for participants in medical trials to experience not only the placebo effect but the “nocebo effect” – drug side-effects such as nausea, dizziness or rashes, even though they’re only taking sugar pills.  To an extent, the “expectation effect” is the stuff of self-help cliche: “Whether you think you can or think you can’t, you’re right,” Henry Ford is supposed to have said, rather irritatingly. But one of Robson’s many strengths as a chronicler of science is to take what might seem familiar and show – to his own evident excitement, as well – just how much deeper the rabbit hole goes. You knew about the placebo effect. But did you know it often works, a little mind-bendingly, even when the patient knows they’re taking a placebo? (This is promising, in terms of medical ethics, because it suggests that people need not be deceived in order to benefit.) And if you knew that, did you know there’s evidence that the placebo effect is growing more powerful over time, as more people learn of the placebo effect, and thus expect to experience it? That’s right: the placebo effect has a placebo effect. Expect your expectations to change your life, and they will. While the book abounds in compelling anecdotes – the cyclist who thought he was injecting performance-enhancing drugs, and performed better accordingly; the Portuguese TV show that caused an outbreak of breathing difficulties in its viewers – Robson’s central point is that the expectation effect isn’t an amusing psychological quirk, but a fundamental aspect of our interactions with reality. Our brains are “prediction machines”, steering us through life by generating expectations, and only revising them when unavoidable. Those expectations then play a vital role in shaping what we experience. This explains why far more people, especially children, see a rabbit in the famous “duck-rabbit” optical illusion around Easter than at other times of year. But it also helps explain why pupils from low-income backgrounds tend to live down to their teachers’ academic expectations – and why some of those teachers tend to react with discomfort, not pride, should they defy their assumptions instead. “Like a dramatist carefully crafting a narrative arc,” Robson writes, “we don’t like the objects of our expectations to go off script.” Robson is aware of the objection that this might all sound like a paean to positive thinking. He rejects that claim: the expectation effect concerns specific outcomes, not a general effort to feel good. Moreover, the cult of positivity reinforces the idea that merely experiencing negative emotions constitutes a crisis, or a personal failing, leading only to more negative emotions: “By demonising unpleasant but inevitable feelings, we have been creating a potent nocebo out of modern life.” In any case, wisely harnessing the power of expectation isn’t a matter of eliminating bad things so much as reframing them – for example, by understanding the feelings of exertion during exercise as evidence that you’re making yourself fitter. (Likewise, I think “writer’s block” is often best thought of simply as what it feels like to push yourself creatively.) That way, apart from anything else, you’re far less likely to quit when the going gets tough. Startling research even shows that when people are encouraged to think of the physical movements in which they already engage for their jobs as exercise, they reap greater health benefits. The result of marinating for a while in this outlook is surprisingly transformative. We’re accustomed to thinking of the external world as an implacable thing that either lives up to, or more commonly frustrates, our expectations. That’s why I’ve always been fond of “defensive pessimism”: keep your expectations low, and you can only ever be pleasantly surprised. But this approach defines our expectations as wholly impotent: vain hopes that reality might or might not deign to fulfil. The Expectation Effect shows that, on the contrary, our expectations participate actively in that reality. Clearly, believing that you could be a champion salsa dancer in your 80s – to pick one of Robson’s examples – doesn’t guarantee that you will be. But it might prove easily as important as the genes you were born with. We defensive pessimists could do with remembering that sometimes things do actually turn out really well – especially if you expect them to.

1/6/2022,"Next rang up £70m more sales than expected over Christmas as a surge in online orders of party dresses and occasionwear made up for lower trade in stores. The fashion and homewares chain is the first retailer to report its Christmas trading results, potentially giving an indication of how the high street fared in the biggest sales period of the year.  The group said it now expected to make £822m in annual profits, £22m more than previously hoped for and almost 10% ahead of pre-pandemic levels, in its fifth increase in guidance in less than a year. In the eight weeks to Christmas Day, Next said its sales rose 20% on 2019 – before the pandemic – despite suffering “materially lower” levels of stocks than it had hoped for while its delivery service had struggled because of labour shortages in its warehouses and distribution networks. “The fact that our sales remained so robust in these circumstances is, we believe, testament to the strength of underlying consumer demand in the period,” the company said in a statement.

1/6/2022,"It was a visceral cry at the moment of maximum peril for American democracy. A furious mob had overrun police and was nearly at the door of the House of Representatives. Inside the chamber, Republican Paul Gosar was launching a spurious challenge to Joe Biden’s election victory in Arizona.  Then, at the back of the gallery on the second floor, Democrat Dean Phillips rose to his feet and screamed at the top of his lungs at Gosar: “This is because of you!” The outburst was out of character for a “Minnesota nice” congressman with a reputation for moderation and working across the aisle. But a year later, Phillips remains convinced it was an urgent and necessary response to the deadly insurrection inspired by then president Donald Trump. “It’s not my style to break decorum and to scream,” he told the Guardian, “but I have to say at that moment I felt the way that tens of millions of Americans did, which is there were people responsible for what was about to transpire and there are moments where you do what you got to do, and I had to do it. I don’t regret it one bit because it’s true.” Phillips, 52, comes from a business background. He led a family-owned distillery – producing vodka, gin, rum and other liquors – and ice cream company. He was elected to Congress in 2018, representing Minnesota’s third congressional district, and is vice chair of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus. “I never imagined I’d be doing this,” he admits. “I woke up the morning after the 2016 election, saw the reaction of my daughters, who were 18 and 16 at that time – their fear, their tears – and I promised them right then and there I would do something, and here I am.” On 6 January 2021, he had been advised that there could be trouble so told his staff to stay home. He watched his office TV “horrified” as Trump gave a speech urging supporters to “fight like hell” to overturn his defeat. He then walked to the House to begin certifying Biden’s election victory. But soon he received text messages from anxious family members showing video of protests forming outside. “I asked my colleague, Tom Malinowski from New Jersey, to walk from the House chamber with me to look out the windows and a Capitol police officer literally screamed at us to get away from the windows and get back into the House chamber. We asked if everything was OK, and – I’ll never forget it – she said, ‘You’re in the United States Capitol. It’s the most secure building in the country’.” They returned to the House chamber just as Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer were being evacuated. Gosar was at the microphone, leading efforts to subvert his state’s electoral college vote, when the sergeant-at-arms urged members to take cover behind seats and prepare their smoke hoods – prompting Phillips to feel “fury” and let rip at the Trump loyalist. While members on the House floor were able to escape, there was no way out for 20 sitting up in the gallery due to coronavirus safety measures. “I screamed at my colleagues at that moment to follow me to the Republican side of the chamber because I thought it would be safer,” Phillips says. “I thought the insurrectionists were coming for us. “First, it was almost impossible to get through these railings; you either had to go under or over. But more than that, I recognized at that very moment that a lot of my colleagues couldn’t blend in. I’m talking about those of color. It really left an indelible mark on me. “That whole day changed me, of course, as it would anybody, to recognise that privilege and the fragility of democracy and also a significant increase in my empathy for those who have endured trauma in their lives, which is life-changing.” Rioters reached the doors of the House chamber but found their way blocked by an improvised barricade and Capitol police with guns drawn. After an ordeal lasting about 25 minutes, Phillips recalls, members in the gallery were led out by a Capitol police officer and through a maze of tunnels. “We ran into the Rayburn lunch room and it was a bizarre moment because there were people just having lunch at the tables. The sun was shining in from the big plate glass windows and here we are, an officer with a rifle running with us into the lunch room and people just stunned, looking at us like, what the heck’s going on? Of course, the TVs moments later would sure change that.” The group was then moved on to a committee room where they were finally safe. But their shared ordeal would stay with them. They now call themselves “the gallery group” and still meet regularly, sometimes with facilitators or therapists. “It’s been the most wonderful support group imaginable because we endured it together,” Phillips says. On the night of 6 January, with the Capitol finally secured, they and other members returned to the House and Senate to finish the job and ratify Biden as president. For a fleeting moment, it seemed that Democrats and Republicans were united in completing the work of democracy and jettisoning the authoritarianism of Trump. But it was not to last. In the year since the insurrection, some Republicans have embraced Trump’s “big lie” and his portrayal of the mob as patriots driven by a noble cause; others have simply remained tight-lipped and failed to denounce it. Phillips, who sees them up close during sessions of Congress, believes they are motivated by self-preservation of both position and personal safety. “That’s perhaps the saddest part of all this. Many of my colleagues – especially those who voted to impeach, those who voted to impanel the January 6 commission, those who voted to certify the election – have received horrifying threats to their safety and the safety of their loved ones. It’s an unenviable position but it’s also our responsibility and duty. I understand self-preservation but I do wish principle would take precedence,” he says. It has been difficult for Phillips to witness 6 January denialism as Republicans and rightwing media attempt to rewrite the history of what happened that day, variously characterising it as a “normal tourist visit” or an FBI “false flag” operation designed to entrap Trump supporters. The former president himself insisted that his followers were “hugging and kissing” police. The Democrat says: “This is one of those rare occasions where I was there. I was inside. I heard the gunshot. I saw the remnants of the insurrection in the rotunda and went with [Congressman] Andy Kim at midnight that night to help clean it up when I saw him on his hands and knees alone.” “I saw the body armour. I saw the clubs. I saw faeces. I saw the speaker’s office ransacked. I saw with my own eyes people on the ground under arrest. I saw the mob breaking in. I met with the officers who were subject to it since. I was there to bear witness to it and to hear people say it didn’t happen or it wasn’t a big deal or it’s time to move on, shame on them.” Republicans’ denial of reality, and continued addiction to Trump, has raised fears that 6 January was the beginning, not the end, of American democracy’s near death experience. The party is imposing sweeping voter restrictions across the country and seeking to put “big lie” believers in charge of future elections. Trump could mount another bid for the White House in 2024 with many checks and balances no longer in place. Phillips comments: “We are at the precipice of a very slippery slope and it’s a long way up the mountain when you’re building a democracy but it’s a fast ride down when it slips away. We collectively have to make a choice and a decision here, starting with the simple fact that this is not something that one side or the other can win.” “If one side upends democracy and destroys its institutions and disrespects the rule of law, chaos will result, violence will result and everything that those propagating this claim is important to them – a strong, stable, secure, prosperous country – will have been lost. That’s why I try to be a voice of reason and a bridge builder, not a destroyer.” A self-described eternal optimist, Phillips believes there is still a cohort in the Republican party that can find a way back to the mainstream. He describes Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, Trump critics serving on the House select committee investigating 6 January, as “heroic”. “I know there are more that share that sentiment that simply are not as public. I have confidence that we will see some type of restoration of principle, assuming American voters find that important.” The congressman’s efforts to lower the political temperature include a series of “common ground” get-togethers in his home district that encourage mutual understanding between constituents across the ideological spectrum. He says: “They’ve inspired me and made me more optimistic because I’ve discovered when, with some intention, you bring people together with disparate political perspectives and break bread, get to know each other and share life stories, common ground is readily available and easily discoverable.” But in this age of polarisation and negative partisanship, there must be some awkward conversations? “We had an experience just a few weeks ago in which someone pulled up in what would be considered a vehicle that a Donald Trump supporter might be driving and someone who was on the far left of that person – in a very uncomfortable moment but it turned out to be a very productive one – acknowledged what she felt when she saw that vehicle pull into the parking lot and what she expected of the person who drove it. “It took courage to share that. It took courage for the driver of the vehicle to listen to it. At the end of the evening, for both of them to recognise their shared humanity and shared interest in a safe and secure country, was a moment of great reassurance but one that can only occur if people stop stereotyping and actually start breaking bread together.”",News/US news,‘I was there’: Democrat recalls horror and fury on day of Capitol attack,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/06/capitol-attack-democrat-dean-phillips-recalls-horror-fury

1/6/2022,"Farmers in England will be given taxpayers’ cash to rewild their land, under plans for large-scale nature recovery projects announced by the government. These will lead to vast tracts of land being newly managed to conserve species, provide habitats for wildlife and restore health to rivers and streams. Bids are being invited for 10-15 pilot projects, each covering at least 500 hectares and up to 5,000 hectares, to a total of approximately 10,000 hectares in the first two-year phase – about 10 times the size of Richmond Park in London. These pilots could involve full rewilding or other forms of management that focus on species recovery and wildlife habitats.  Rare fauna such as sand lizards, water voles and curlews will be targeted, with the aim of improving the status of about half of the most threatened species in England. The exact funding has not been disclosed, as bids will be compared to determine value for money before a final decision on which should go ahead is made this summer. However, the total amount available for such schemes is expected to reach £700m to £800m a year by 2028. By 2042, the government aims to have up to 300,000 hectares of England covered by such “landscape recovery” projects – an area roughly the size of Lancashire. Ministers also plan to offer English farmers payments for “local nature recovery”. The smaller-scale actions taken on their farms could include planting more trees, restoring peatlands or wetlands and leaving space for wildlife habitats. These payments, which will be revealed later this year, should also reach up to £800m a year by 2028. George Eustice, the secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs, said the aim was for wildlife and nature protection to run alongside food production as a matter of course for most farmers. He is expected to tell farmers at the Oxford Farming Conference on Thursday: “We want to see profitable farm businesses producing nutritious food and underpinning a growing rural economy, where nature is recovering and people have better access to it. Through our new schemes, we are going to work with farmers and land managers to halt the decline in species, reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, increase woodland, improve water and air quality and create more space for nature.” As well as the two new schemes – landscape recovery and local nature recovery – farmers will also be able to apply for payments to help them protect their soil and take other basic environmental protection measures, under plans announced last year. Funding for these measures will also reach about £800m a year, as part of the post-Brexit overhaul of the £2.4bn-a-year farming subsidies into a system of “public money for public goods”. This means farmers are paid for making environmental improvements, rather than the amount of land they farm. Green campaigners were sceptical over whether the new payments would be enough to meet the government’s aim of halting the loss of wild species abundance and managing 30% of land for the good of nature by 2030, as well as ensuring that farmers help to solve the climate crisis rather than add to it. The Wildlife Trusts, RSPB and National Trust charities said detail on how the schemes would work was still lacking. Craig Bennett, the chief executive of The Wildlife Trusts, said: “The real test of this agricultural transition is not whether it is a little bit better or moderately better than what came before, but whether it will be enough to deliver on [the government’s targets]. Anything less than that means that this historic opportunity will have been wasted. While we’re hearing the right noises from the government, the devil will be in the detail and the detail is still not published nearly six years after the EU referendum.” The schemes would fail unless more was done to help farmers move away from intensive practices, said Jo Lewis, the policy and strategy director at the Soil Association. This could include the introduction of ambitious targets for reducing pesticide and fertiliser use. “These schemes won’t work in isolation. They risk failure if they are forced to compete with mounting commercial pressures that encourage more intensive farming and cheap food production, for which the environment and our health ultimately pay the price,” she said. Though some are benefiting from high grain prices, many farmers are facing a difficult outlook, with rising input costs, plummeting exports due to Brexit red tape, and potential new competition from prospective importers after post-Brexit trade deals. Martin Lines, the UK chair of the Nature Friendly Farming Network, said that farmers who already take environmental measures were “left in limbo” before the schemes start in 2024. “Government has been running similar environmental stewardship schemes voluntarily for farmers for 20 or 30 years, yet we still have seen huge declines in wildlife. We need these schemes to be bolder and more ambitious, not just delivering more of the same with minor improvements,” he said. Tenant farmers, who work on about a third of farmed land in the UK, are concerned over how they can access the new schemes. They also fear that their landlords may take advantage of large-scale rewilding to remove their tenancies. George Dunn, of the Tenant Farmers Association, said: “It is alarming that, after at least three years of discussions with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, it has no clear plan for access to these schemes by tenant farmers. [Current payments] are being removed while we have a vague commitment for further work to be undertaken on how tenants, and those who use common land, can access schemes. It does feel like we are pushing water uphill.” Mark Tufnell, the president of the Country Land and Business Association, which represents 28,000 farmers, landowners and rural businesses, said: “The government must also ensure that policy changes look towards domestic food production and security. Britain is already at the forefront of agricultural innovation and animal welfare standards, and we must do more to make certain that our great produce is supported here and abroad. We need to guarantee that profitable agriculture remains a core part of the rural economy and feeds the nation sustainably.”",News/Environment,England’s farmers to be paid to rewild land,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/06/englands-farmers-to-be-paid-to-rewild-land
1/6/2022,"Like swirling paper scraps from a bonfire, the charcoal-winged vultures circled high overhead. When I imitated a lamb’s bleat they circled closer, stretching their massive wings and craning long wrinkled necks. The bone-white rocks of the Gorge of the Dead was a fitting backdrop for these pterodactyl-like birds – I could have been in a scene from Jurassic Park. Named not for the hikers that have perished here (happily none has) but because it’s littered with caves where the Minoans once buried their dead, this seven-mile canyon – also called the Zakros gorge – is the end of the Cretan section of the ultra-long-distance E4 hiking route. The whole trail runs for more than 10,000km from Tarifa in Spain to Cyprus, but this island’s stretch starts 320km away in the north-western town of Kastelli-Kissamos and ends at the remote resort of Kato Zakros.  My plan was to hike a bite-size 35km stretch of the E4 in reverse, from Kato Zakros, near the start of the gorge, to Vóri, a hamlet further south where I would catch a bus back to the port town of Sitia. Far from the doom and gloom of TV and social media and the stress of living in a Covid-stricken world, I would heal my soul – for a weekend, at least – by hiking through untamed landscapes and foragiing for food in one of the wildest corners of Crete. Packing my old rucksack with fruit, drinking water and a bag of crumbly feta cheese, I set out in early December. Just over 300 nautical miles from Libya and on roughly the same latitude as Cyprus, eastern Crete is almost as warm as Andalucía in winter. In summer and autumn, soaring temperatures can make hiking sticky and unpleasant, but winter means temperatures around 20C, and the sun shining gently in a sky the colour of stone-washed denim. Leaving the vultures behind, I was soon deep inside the gorge, hiking on a slippery, shale-strewn path between skyscraper-high cliffs. Apart from the drone of bees in the late-flowering thyme and the fierce whistle of a golden eagle somewhere on high, the silence was absolute. The caves where the Minoans once worshipped the souls of their ancestors – and where in later years defiant locals hid from the successive wrath of Venetians, Turks and Nazis – stared down at me like the blankly watchful faces of ancient Greek masks. After two hours of hard hiking I collapsed on a rock near the top of the gorge and took in the view. Far below, the once-magnificent Minoan Palace of Zakros, with its remains of marble-pillared halls, shrines and ceremonial pools, shimmered like a mirage above the horseshoe-shaped bay of Zakros. It was from the bay that the Minoans once sailed – boats weighed down with jars of wine, olives and figs – to trade for gold and ivory with Egypt and Syria. It was easy to picture the square-sailed ships setting out from this lonely spot; with little or no tourism and only a handful of inhabitants, Kato Zakros still has a sense of antiquity. Scrambling up one final, staircase-steep section of gorge I emerged near pano (upper) Zakros: a handful of tavernas and a cluster of square white houses in the Unesco-classified Sitia Geopark. At Hotel Zakros I lunched on fried snails (xochloi bourbouristi) in vinegar, rice-stuffed courgette flowers (kolokithanthi gemisti) and other delicious meze. Leaving Zakros I followed a winding road – past an old mill and the springs that once fed it – and into a sheltered valley where I found an abandoned citrus grove and filled my pockets with tiny sweet tangerines and waxy-skinned lemons. A buffeting wind that tugged at my pack pushed me up along a track lined with purple heather and out on to the plateau of Mavros Kambos – the Black Plain – named for a bloody skirmish with Ottoman troops in the 16th century. Black was a misnomer, however: the fertile plain was viridescent with horta, the wild greens that have been a staple of the Cretan diet since Minoan times. I gathered some of my favourites – galatsida (common brighteyes), radiki (dandelion) and agriozohos (golden fleece) – for dinner. By 6pm when I reached Skalia (abandoned in the 18th century after its inhabitants were massacred by the Turks) the sun was low on the horizon, casting an eerie scarlet light on the old stone houses with their caved-in walls and roofs. Finding a sheltered spot I boiled the horta on my camping stove, drained off the water, added lemon juice and olive oil and ate it with a chunk of feta, enjoying the contrast of salty pungent sheep’s cheese with the tender greens. It was dark by now – so dark that, apart from the distant glow of a village far below, there was no light at all and stars filled the entire sky. It was breathtaking – like being inside a geodesic dome pasted with millions of glittering snowflakes. Filled with renewed energy after my vitamin-packed foraged dinner I set off along a flinty path fringed with purple heather to Ziros, where I spent the night at Arismari apartments, a sparkling modern complex in the centre of the village. With its small square houses – and backdrop of jagged blue mountain, this tiny village 30km from the nearest town seemed incredibly isolated when I woke to bright sunshine the following day. Nikos, who owns the cafe where I breakfasted on toast and local thyme honey, told me that recent DNA tests by a Florida university proved that most of the inhabitants in this Lasithi region are descended directly from the Minoans. A dirt track – via vineyards that produce the crisp and spicy Assyrtiko wines – led through the tiny mountain village of Armeni and then down along a winding road to Vóri. A fug of wine and woodsmoke told me I was approaching a casani, the copper still where – in winter – Cretans distil grape skins left from winemaking to produce raki. Manolis, the shepherd who owned the still, handed me a plastic beaker of what looked like spring water. I took a sip and nearly choked on the burning 70% proof alcohol. Manolis told me he’d lived in Lasithi all his life. I mentioned what I’d heard about the DNA tests. “Eh!” he shrugged and took a deep slug from his beaker. “The Minoans loved dancing, women and raki – of course they were our ancestors!” I hiked on to the outskirts of Vóri where – with Manolis’s permission – I rolled out my sleeping bag in his olive grove. As I lay back to admire the blazing sky full of stars my head was spinning. It was mostly the raki, but I was also giddy with the joy of escaping – for those 35km – the world of Covid.

1/6/2022,"The evidence for whether new year resolutions are effective is mixed. Make them Smart – specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and timely – and they can be a spur to effective action. But vaguer resolutions such as “get fit”, “lose weight” or “stop wasting so much time” often conceal a deeper self-criticism that undermines our intentions. The underlying approach is that we must simply try harder – sometimes at everything at once – and that sets us up to fail. We binge on diets, then binge on food and, finally, binge on guilt.  I’ve found that apps that help turn my unfocused intentions into a Smart plan really work. A Couch to 5K programme got me running, and I liked having a clear objective. It feels good to be fitter. You might see a bald bloke running with a waddling gait, but I see goals met and targets smashed – and a 10K in my sights. But there’s a downside to resolutions, even when they’re effective and we achieve them. The focus on results has got me checking my Google Fit stats a little too often, introducing an element of data-driven compulsiveness to the simple activity of exercising my body. It reminds me of the impulse I sometimes feel to check my Facebook likes and Twitter followers. I sense it fits with a wider cultural current: the strain coming from the constant effort to keep up, be productive and get ahead is a source of stress, not its cure. Recognising this, part of me wants to simply ditch my phone and forget the targets. I’m a Buddhist, I’ve taught mindfulness for 15 years, and that part of me wants to be unproductive and turn, as we say on our courses, from doing mode to being mode. My favourite exponent of such non-utilitarian living is John Keats, who advocated “delicious diligent indolence” in a letter written to a friend in 1818: “Let us not,” he writes, “go hurrying about and collecting honey, bee-like buzzing here and there for a knowledge that is to be arrived at, but let us open our leaves like a flower, and be passive and receptive.” Keats’s word “diligent” signals that, by indolence, he doesn’t mean inertia. Maintaining an alert receptivity requires what Buddhism calls practice – a conscious effort to develop it over time, which should be undertaken with “balanced effort” – a middle way between wilful or compulsive striving and self-indulgence. The Buddha’s image of this was of a musical instrument whose strings must be tuned neither too loosely nor too tightly. Drawing on my experience as a mindfulness teacher, I have some suggestions for middle-way practices that foster the alert receptivity Keats recommends. The first is learning to settle the mind. Meditation is by no means the only way to do this, but it’s popular because it offers simple methods for shifting attention from the flow of thoughts to something calming, like the breath. If you’ve tried it for yourself you’ll know that the thoughts don’t just stop, and you sometimes feel uncomfortable. But settling the mind and stepping into a different kind of awareness is actually a fairly straightforward process. That’s a start, but the value of doing this is the “mental space” that opens up by freeing yourself from mental strain and clutter. So it’s important that we don’t just fill the space up again with more input. Buddhism has always spoken of the need to “guard the gates of the senses” – to manage what we expose our minds to, if we want them to develop. And that takes on fresh importance when, with a few clicks, we can access an effectively unlimited supply of movies, music tracks, websites and just about any other diversion we can imagine. There’s not much point in achieving a goal like getting fit or losing weight if it becomes a new source of stress. What I’m really seeking as I run is a sense of flourishing and vitality, and that can only happen by being fully present and aware in each moment, not just when I reach 10K. A more mindful way of living values simplicity over consumption and allows space between activities. It focuses on doing one thing at a time and doing it fully. We need time to reflect and to be curious. These things can be practices, and perhaps you can frame them as Smart resolutions. But in the end we don’t just need to be smart. We need to be wise.

1/6/2022,"Ethiopia has lifted a five-month suspension of the Norwegian Refugee Council’s aid work after it cleared the organisation of allegations of spreading “misinformation”. The government ordered the NRC, along with Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), to stop work for three months in July, including operations in the Tigray conflict zone. Both organisations were ordered to stop their humanitarian work in July but while MSF’s suspension was lifted in October, the NRC’s was extended.  “It is heart-breaking that we were unable to reach our target of serving more than half a million in need across Ethiopia in 2021,” Jan Egeland, NRC secretary general, said in a statement. “Now that we have to restart, it will take time to again reach as many people as we did before the suspension. We have lost many of our staff. We urgently need permits for our international staff to return, and we need to be able to pay our suppliers.” NRC said it was given a “strict warning” from the government over future advocacy on humanitarian needs. Ethiopian National Defence Forces  Ethiopia's national military is one of the biggest standing armed forces in Africa, with an estimated 140,000 personnel. Its air force has fighter jets and armed drones. The ENDF has considerable battle experience, fighting wars with Eritrea, quelling rebellions and confronting Islamist militants in Somalia.  Tigrayan rebels  The TPLF dominated the political alliance that ruled Ethiopia for nearly 30 years until anti-government protests swept Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to power in 2018. At the outset of fighting the TPLF had a large paramilitary force and well-trained local militia possibly numbering 250,000 men in total. They were battle-hardened, having led the struggle that toppled Ethiopia's autocratic regime in 1991 and fighting a brutal border war with Eritrea. Oromo fighters The Oromo Liberation Army, an insurgent group bent on overthrowing Abiy, has linked up with the TPLF on the battlefield. Ethiopia declared the TPLF and OLA terrorist organisations in May, helping nudge the historic foes towards an unlikely military pact against their common enemy. The OLA broke off from the Oromo Liberation Front, an opposition party that spent years in exile but was allowed to return to Ethiopia after Abiy took office. Believed to number in the low thousands, it is fighting for self-determination for the Oromo, Ethiopia's largest ethnic group. OLA combatants have longstanding grievances with ethnic Amharas, and Abiy's government has accused the OLA of massacres. Amhara forces  Regular and irregular combatants from Amhara have been a major ally of government forces since the war began. These militias occupied areas of southern Tigray and seized the region's fertile west, which ethnic Amharas consider part of their homeland. Over the last year, ethnic Amharas have been returning to western Tigray and occupying abandoned homes and farmland in a state-backed campaign the United States has described as ""ethnic cleansing"". Amharas claim western Tigray was stolen from them decades ago when the TPLF ruled the country. Their involvement in the conflict has fanned ethnic hostilities. As the TPLF has advanced further into the region, Amhara leaders have warned their very existence is at stake and urged locals to join the fight. Eritrea Tigray borders Eritrea, whose leader Isaias Afwerki is close to Abiy and a sworn enemy of the TPLF, which ruled Ethiopia when both countries fought their border war. For months, Addis Ababa and Asmara flatly denied the presence of Eritrean troops in Tigray, despite persistent eyewitness testimony to the contrary. Abiy finally acknowledged their presence in March and said their departure was imminent. But they remain in Tigray and it is unclear whether Abiy could make them leave - or afford to let them go. Agence France-Presse NRC had been providing food, clean water, shelter, education and legal help to 25,000 people when it was ordered to suspend its operations. At the time, the UN called the bans “dangerous” and said Ethiopia needed evidence to back up its claims that the aid groups were spreading misinformation. MSF was banned in the Tigray, Gambella, Amhara and Somali regions. Along with spreading misinformation, the organisation was accused of bringing in satellite communication equipment without authorisation and not getting the correct permits for employees. In September the organisation said the suspension had forced it to discharge patients from clinics at short notice, and meant it could not help people affected by the Tigray conflict, refugees from South Sudan and people suffering from neglected tropical diseases. MSF said that while the three-month suspension had been lifted in late October, it had been difficult to restart operations. “Although we are permitted to resume our work, it has not been possible to restart those medical programmes, mainly due to the current security situation and administrative obstacles,” the spokesperson said. In November, MSF was forced to suspend work in some parts of the country for safety reasons. “Despite the significant scale of humanitarian needs faced by the Ethiopian people in many regions of the country, MSF considers it difficult to restart and expand its response to address those needs.” MSF said it was talking with the government and other parties to find ways to continue providing medical services.",News/Global development,Ethiopia lifts five-month suspension of Norwegian Refugee Council’s aid work,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/06/ethiopia-lifts-five-month-suspension-of-norwegian-refugee-councils-aid-work
1/6/2022,"Striking images taken during the Falkland Islands conflict will go on display together for the first time in a new Imperial War Museums (IWM) exhibition which aims to highlight the long-term legacy of war. The photographs, by Paul Haley for the British army’s Soldier magazine, will feature alongside other exhibits, including online films, to mark the 40th anniversary of the 10-week undeclared 1982 war, with a focus on new awareness of its impact.  Opening on 2 April – the anniversary of the invasion by Argentina – at IWM museums in London, Salford and online, the exhibition aims to bring a new perspective to a war that claimed the lives of 255 British military, 649 Argentinian troops and three civilian Falkland islanders, said the show’s curator, Dr Hilary Roberts. Haley was a first-hand witness, accompanying the taskforce from setting off on board the QE2, to landing at San Carlos in East Falkland and capturing the immediate aftermath of the Battle of Goose Green and the journey to Port Stanley. He also photographed the Argentinian Skyhawks flying overhead on their way to bomb the British navy vessels Sir Galahad and Sir Tristram. Some of the images, and accounts from Falkland islanders, will also feature in five short films, made digitally available, which will explore the impact of the war, at the time and subsequently. Roberts, the senior curator of IWM’s cold war team, said research offered a new understanding of the conflict, which even today was “still a lens” through which UK-Argentina relations were assessed. “Today we have a greater understanding of the way in which that small conflict has permanently influenced international events, in terms of political legacies, military legacies and social and cultural consequences,” she said. The outcome shaped both governments in power. The Argentinian military junta fell, with Gen Leopoldo Galtieri forced to resign the following the year, while Margaret Thatcher became one of the longest-serving prime ministers. “The Falklands factor has been much debated. I won’t say it’s the only reason why, but it was clearly one of the factors,” said Roberts. The conflict led to new research into post-traumatic stress disorder and had a lasting influence on Royal Navy ship design, deployment of vessels and commitment to aircraft carriers and submarines, she added. “I hope it will give people awareness that this wasn’t simply a small colonial war, and it wasn’t simply an aberration. It does continue to affect our lives, and that small wars should not underestimated,” she said. “The conflict is moving, slowly, from contemporary history, which is informed by people still alive to tell the story, into documented and researched history, where we learn more from the archives but we gradually lose those voices which are so important.” Haley’s work will feature alongside that of the war artist Linda Kitson, accounts from the Falkland islanders, and exhibits including an Exocet missile and an Argentinian anti-aircraft gun captured by the Gurkhas.

1/6/2022,"Treasure hunters who believe they found a huge cache of fabled US civil war-era gold in Pennsylvania are now on the prowl for something as elusive as the buried booty itself: government records of the FBI’s excavation. Finders Keepers, a lost treasure locate and recovery service, filed a federal lawsuit against the justice department over its failure to produce documents on the FBI’s search for the legendary gold, which took place nearly four years ago at a remote woodland site in north-western Pennsylvania.  “With its request Plaintiff seeks to confirm the FBI’s recovery of Civil War-era gold buried in the mountains of Pennsylvania, based in significant part on scientific evidence of the gold’s existence that Plaintiff provided the FBI,” the lawsuit said. The FBI has since dragged its feet on the treasure hunters’ Freedom of Information Act request for records, their lawyer said on Wednesday. “There’s been a pattern of behavior by the FBI that’s been very troubling,” said Anne Weismann, who represents Finders Keepers. She questioned whether the agency was “acting in good faith”. A message was sent to the justice department seeking comment on the suit, which asks a judge to order the FBI to immediately turn over the records. Finders Keepers’ owners, the father-son duo of Dennis and Kem Parada, had spent years looking for what, according to the legend, was an 1863 shipment of Union gold that was lost or stolen on its way to the US Mint in Philadelphia, which was supposed to be used to pay the wages of federal troops. The troops carrying the gold went missing, along with the loot, giving rise to generations of speculation about what happened to it, although historians have cast doubt on the claim, pointing to the lack of official records of the shipment. The duo focused on a spot where they say their instruments detected a large metallic mass. After meeting with the treasure hunters in early 2018, the FBI brought in a contractor with more sophisticated instruments. The contractor detected an underground mass that weighed up to nine tons and had the density of gold, according to an FBI affidavit unsealed last year. “I have probable cause to believe that a significant cache of gold is secreted in the underground cave,” in Dent’s Run, holding “one or more tons” belonging to the US government, Jacob Archer of the FBI’s art crime team in Philadelphia said. Accounts differ as to the amount of gold in the shipment. Some reports say it was 26 gold bars, others 52. Each would have weighed 23kg, meaning it would be worth up to $50m today. In March 2018, the Paradas accompanied the FBI to the site in Dent’s Run, approximately 135 miles north-east of Pittsburgh, but say they were confined to their car while the FBI excavated. The FBI has long insisted that the March 2018 dig came up empty, but the agency has consistently stymied the Paradases’ efforts to obtain information. Finders Keepers asked the justice department for expedited processing, which can be granted in cases where there is widespread media interest involving questions about the government’s integrity. However, the justice department has denied the request – and, as of last month, has yet to assign the Foia request to a staffer for processing, according to the lawsuit. “From the outset, it seems as if the FBI is doing everything it can to avoid answering the question of whether they actually found gold,” Weismann said.",News/US news,Treasure hunters demand answers from FBI about search for civil war-era gold,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/06/civil-war-gold-treasure-hunters-fbi-lawsuit
1/6/2022,"There’s a great turn from Jeremy Irons as the careworn appeaser Neville Chamberlain in this breezy what-if political thriller, adapted from the page-turner by Robert Harris and directed by Christian Schwochow. It’s set at the notorious 1938 Munich conference, convened by Adolf Hitler to force the cringing western powers into giving him the Czech Sudetenland.  With some generous revisionism, this film makes the case for Chamberlain’s savvy negotiating powers and heroic self-sacrifice: he was apparently buying time for British rearmament and exposing Hitler as a bully at the cost of his own reputation. The movie even includes some eyebrow-raising dialogue on the plane home, after Chamberlain has got Hitler to sign that piece of paper promising “peace in our time”, in which the prime minister predicts that if the Führer ever broke his promise, he would call down world fury on himself – and even bring the Americans into the resulting war! Could Chamberlain have come within a mile of foreseeing that? Or is the movie’s tongue in its cheek? George MacKay and Jannis Niewöhner play Hugh Legat and Paul von Hartman, two (fictional) minor functionaries on the British and German sides who happened to be best friends at Oxford in the early 30s. With their German friend Lenya (Liv Lisa Fries), they had a kind of come-to-the-Cabaret intimacy, of a more wholesomely non-sexual sort, before Hugh fell out with Paul over the young German’s Hitler fan-worship and Lenya mysteriously vanished. But fast forward to 1938 and Paul is now secretly anti-Nazi, planning to sneak his old pal Hugh a secret document that will prove Hitler’s plans for conquest and disrupt the deal. If he is caught, he will be sent to the camps – and the British themselves, increasingly committed to appeasement and their own supposed heroism in averting war, would be furious at this desperately dangerous game. Robert Bathurst plays genial British ambassador Sir Nevile Henderson and Alex Jennings is the peppery, stiff-necked diplomat Horace Wilson. In this very male world, perhaps it is telling that the female characters are the fictional ones: Jessica Brown Findlay is Hugh’s unhappy wife Pamela and Sandra Hüller is Helen Winter, the worldly army widow with whom Paul is having a gloomy affair. The Führer is Ulrich Matthes, who played Goebbels in Downfall. Just as Hugh is beguiled by Chamberlain’s twinkly-eyed charm in private over whisky and cigars, so Paul finds himself mesmerised by Hitler’s cobra gaze and the sickly, hideous thrill of Führerkontakt as Hitler, due to some caprice of his own, decides that he will elicit the opinion of this stammering aide. It all rattles along easily enough, with some nice spycraft setpieces. As with Frederick Forsyth’s The Day of the Jackal, the fact that you know what happens in the end is no bar to enjoyment. But the junior members of the cast, who are the stars, look pretty lightweight compared to Irons’s Chamberlain and I wonder if it wouldn’t have been better to adapt Harris’s book as a two- or three-part streaming TV version in which characterisation could have been built up and smoothed out, and Lenya’s fate would have been resolved less perfunctorily. Well, none of this stops it being an ingenious, elegant counter-factual drama.

1/6/2022,"The three weeks with my 19-year-old back from his first term at university has been a joy. We missed him, of course, but also, as the only member of our family to have done anything novel over the past year, he seems thrillingly exotic. We badgered him with questions like medieval peasants welcoming a knight returned from the crusades. “You went bowling?” we whisper in wonder. “You sat in a library! With strangers!” But his return has also revealed to me how worryingly far along the road of role reversal we have already gone. His is a sweetly sensible generation and I often feel grossly irresponsible around them. So far, he has told me off for not drinking enough (well, any) water, not taking weight-bearing exercise, and looking forward to The Apprentice (him: “It’s just trashy reality TV”; me: “That’s the point?”). As his father and I experimented with various festive alcohols and artery hardeners, he brewed his own herbal teas from whole spices, ground in the pestle and mortar he requested for Christmas, and bemoaned the lack of a tofu press in our house. Yesterday, he urged me, the person who views any meal that takes more than 15 minutes to prepare as a personal affront, to soak my own pulses.  Most evenings he works or reads something improving while we sit gormlessly in front of yet another iteration of MasterChef, picking biscuit crumbs from our cleavage (me) or sleeping (spouse). Last week things came to a head when he distributed copies of a paper he had read on the deleterious effect of “media multitasking” (basically, looking at our phones while watching TV) on memory. It will never stop being delightful to see your child become an adult, but this is dangerous. If I can now relinquish responsibility for behaving like a grownup, where will this end? Will I blow the mortgage on 90s fashions on Depop, or get a mate to give me a septum piercing?

1/6/2022,"Staff shortages caused by Covid are pummelling the Australian economy, emptying supermarket shelves and closing shops and restaurants amid renewed calls for rapid antigen tests to be made free in workplaces. While there is no hard data on how many people are off work because they have Covid, are isolating due to being a close contact or are waiting for a test, some companies are reporting that half of their employees are unable to attend.  Trucking and logistics are particularly hard-hit, as is the meat industry, which this week warned of shortages unless slaughterhouses and boning rooms were either exempted from health orders prohibiting close contacts from working or provided with Covid tests. There are empty spaces on supermarket shelves in every department of the two big supermarkets, Coles and Woolworths, as staff shortages hit every part of the supply chain from suppliers through to transport companies and the chains’ own distribution centres, which send products to individual stores. In a return to measures last seen at the height of the first wave in 2020, Coles has limited sales of mince, sausages, chicken breasts and chicken thighs to one packet per customer in order to stop panic buying. Woolworths has yet to bring in buying limits. Supermarkets are also reducing the range of products they sell in order to make life easier for their suppliers. There are fears within the supermarket industry that some stores may be forced to shut or reduce their hours due to workers being unavailable. While loosened close contact rules have made it easier to keep people at work, this extra capacity has been overwhelmed by the skyrocketing number of Covid cases, which climbed past 68,000 across Australia on Thursday. Scott Morrison said testing requirements for truck drivers had been watered down in a bid to ease the strain on the logistics system while the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has spoken to supermarket bosses about the crisis. The prime minister admitted the rolling staff shortages were taking a toll on the economy and said the federal government was focused on increasing capacity in critical areas including healthcare, distribution centres, food production and transport. “We need truck drivers to keep on trucking, that is what we need to do to keep moving things around,” Morrison said. “And right now they are delivering vaccines to GPs and pharmacists, and that system is of course under strain because of the high case numbers.” The prime minister has also asked the attorney general, Michaelia Cash, to meet with state governments to discuss loosening laws that require employers to maintain a safe workplace so that small business does not have to bear the cost of buying rapid antigen tests (RATs), the price of which has skyrocketed due to soaring demand and limited supply. A spokesman for Cash said the Morrison government “will work with state and territory governments to provide clarity to employers on rapid antigen testing requirements under WHS [work health and safety] laws”. “The attorney general is reaching out to WHS ministers to progress this work.” Unions strongly opposed the idea, which they doubt is practical, and repeated their call for the government to provide free RATs for small businesses. The acting secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Liam O’Brien, said all workers were entitled to the same level of protection at work as Morrison, who on Wednesday said he was able to get RATs provided to workers at the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet because he was “an employee in this building, like everybody else”. O’Brien attacked Morrison for failing to buy enough RATs despite the warning, given by unions and businesses in October, that they would be needed once restrictions were reduced and face-to-face commerce resumed. “On the one hand he’s entitled to this very safe workplace [but] because he’s failed to do his job in securing enough tests for the nation, the rest of us are expected to work in less safe conditions,” O’Brien said. “If we’re going to start to remove the obligations on employers to introduce rapid testing, not only are we going to see more workplace outbreaks, which is going to lead to more people getting Covid, but as we’re seeing right now, we’re going to see businesses shutting down.” He said workplace health and safety laws were under the control of the states, not the federal government. “I don’t think it is possible or practical for him [Morrison] to amend eight different pieces of state legislation,” he said. It seems that Morrison is saying instead of providing free tests for workers and employers, he will weaken health and safety protections for workers because that’s what employers want! We will see about that. The union that represents employed chemists, Professional Pharmacists Australia, said a plan announced by Morrison to hand out up to 10 free tests to concession card holders was not good enough. “Such limited access doesn’t help millions of workers and businesses who need access to multiple tests on a regular basis to protect workplace health safety and operational continuity,” the union’s chief executive, Jill McCabe, said. “Access to free tests is a critical health and safety risk-mitigation measure required to reduce the spread of Covid in workplaces.” As Guardian Australia has previously reported, tourism and hospitality operators and airlines have also had to reduce their operations due to staff shortages caused by the surge in cases. Sarah Hunter, the chief economist for Australia at BIS Oxford Economics, said it was hard to gauge the effect of staff shortages on the economy until workforce statistics were released by the Bureau of Statistics late next month. She said it was also difficult to tell whether the hit was caused by the problems with supply or a slump in demand. “You’re also seeing people being less willing to get out and about, shop, that kind of thing,” she said. “Whether it’s because people aren’t able to go to work or they don’t want to go out, it’s difficult to tell because they’re happening at the same time.” However, Hunter said Australia could learn from the woes experienced by the UK and US in previous waves where those countries did not lock down. She said up to 25% of employees across the third of the Australian workforce that was in industries where working from home was not possible could be put out of action at any one time. “Twenty five per cent is definitely a worst case, I’m not saying that’s going to happen, but clearly for the next few months it’s going to be difficult across the economy,” she said. “It’s not just healthcare industries, it’s companies like Woolworths and Coles and the food supply chain. “In the UK in their last wave they were having problems not because of supply problems but because they weren’t able to get things on the shelves.” Hunter said another pressure point would be parents who were unable to work because their children had to stay home and needed to be supervised. “Again it’s hard to know how much of an impact this will have, but in the US and the UK this factor has been cited in surveys as one of the reasons people haven’t yet returned to the workforce.”",News/Australia news,Staff shortages batter Australian economy as Covid surge leaves half of some companies’ employees unable to work ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/06/staff-shortages-batter-australian-economy-as-covid-surge-leaves-half-of-some-companies-employees-unable-to-work
