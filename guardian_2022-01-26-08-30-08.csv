1/26/2022,"Good morning and welcome to Five Great Reads, written today on what always was and always will be Aboriginal land (Cammeraygal land, specifically – this has always been a multicultural place). Whether it is a day to commemorate survival; to protest ongoing injustice; or if it’s just another work day for you, I hope all First Nations readers are able to do what they need to get through today, and that everyone else takes a moment to reflect on the history of this land and considers paying the rent (my colleagues have a podcast about that for you to listen to). And if you’re reading this from outside Australia and have no idea what I’m talking about, here’s a piece from Chelsea Watego on the meaning of 26 January.

As always, if you want to follow the news as it happens today, please head over to our live blog. Now, on to the reads. The Tent Embassy is “a place of Aboriginal resistance in direct line of sight of the halls of power in Canberra”, write Lorena Allam and Juno Gemes. Five decades on, they tell the story of its founding and the vital role it still plays today. Notable quote: Michael Anderson, who was one of four young Aboriginal men who originally set up the camp, remembers a forced attempt to dismantle the embassy, six months later. “I’ve been in some brawls in my time … but it was nothing like what happened back then,” he says. “The record shows that there were about 36 policemen went to hospital and 18 of us went to jail. And so it was a bloody battle. It was one of the roughest I’ve been involved in.” The embassy now: “It’s a place where people looked for networking into housing, into the health services, just to be listened to,” says Roxley Foley, who lived at there as a caretaker from 2016 to 2019. “The amount of old people we had travelling to that space as almost a pilgrimage, to heal something in themselves.” How long will it take me to read?

The conditions faced by Britain’s GPs will mostly be familiar to Australians – the challenging pivot to telehealth, long waitlists, staffing shortages and risks of sickness. But there’s one key difference: a significant media and political campaign is being waged against them. Here Sirin Kale chronicles one doctor’s long, hard winter. Key background: “A September survey of 1,000 GPs from the healthcare publication Pulse found that 74% had experienced increased levels of abuse post-pandemic,” Kale writes. Notable quote: Dr Farah Jameel, BMA England GP committee chair, says: “This frustration is because the public is being led to believe that everything is fine, and GPs are lazy, and that’s why you can’t see them. That’s how the public is being stoked. And of course, if that’s what you believe, you would be angry, too. But if they understood the challenges, they might direct that anger at policymakers.” How long will it take me to read? About 10 minutes.

In meticulous detail, Sofi Thanhauser plots out the trade deals, special zones and brutal treatments of labour that lead to the Caribbean basin becoming the US’s go-to region for cheap clothing manufacturing. She finds this “didn’t create wealth for workers but, in Honduras, it did lead to the rise of a class of oligarchs who would exert a powerful right-leaning force on the nation’s politics”. Notable quote: “The global supply chain that brings us our clothing can seem intimidatingly complex,” Thanhauser writes. “But what if it isn’t? Clothing brands farm out the making of goods to whoever in the world can do it most cheaply, and then divorce themselves in the eyes of customers from the facts on the ground. That’s pretty simple.” How long will it take me to read? About nine minutes. It has been 15 years since John Cameron Mitchell (yes, Hedwig) released Shortbus: an indie comedy with a lot of real sex. It’s hard to imagine the same film being made today – ahead of a cinematic re-release in the US, its creator discusses why.

1/26/2022,"Asmall brick hospital in rural Bangladesh with its own zigzagging canal has been named the best new building in the world, winning the RIBA international prize 2021. A model of climate-conscious design built with the bare minimum of resources, the Friendship hospital beat off competition from a gallery in Berlin by David Chipperfield, and a cycle and footbridge in Denmark by Wilkinson Eyre. Located in Satkhira, in the waterlogged landscape of the Bengal in south-western Bangladesh, the winner of the Royal Institute of British Architects’ award used water as its chief starting point. The canal zigzags its way through the site, collecting valuable rainwater and helping to cool the surrounding courtyards during the sweltering summer months. It also serves as a barrier between the inpatient and outpatient departments, separating the two sides of the site across shared courtyards, without the need for a dividing wall.  “There is water everywhere here,” says architect Kashef Chowdhury, director of Urbana, the Dhaka-based practice behind the project. “But it’s not always the useful kind.” Rising sea levels caused by the climate crisis have meant that the surrounding landscape of grain fields has been transformed into shrimp fisheries, while the groundwater has become too saline to use for most purposes. In the rainy season, locals do everything they can to collect and store every last drop of fresh water. Chowdhury has therefore designed the building to be a machine for rainwater harvesting, with every roof and courtyard surface draining into the central canal, which runs into two storage tanks at either end of the site. It is the first “land hospital” for the NGO Friendship, for which Chowdhury has helped to convert several boats into floating hospitals in the past, designed to serve remote communities in the delta region. Built for a tight budget of just under $2m, their first permanent building provides a medical lifeline for thousands of people in an area that was heavily affected by a major cyclone in 2007. Using locally made bricks, Chowdhury has developed a campus that has the feeling of a village, with buildings set at angles around courtyards, framed with colonnades that help to shade the wards within. These deep outdoor corridors also provide shelter from driving rain and encourage cross ventilation through the buildings, while bouncing daylight back inside, so no artificial light is needed during the day. The blocks are angled to take advantage of the prevailing wind direction, meaning that most areas don’t need air conditioning either, except the operating theatres and delivery rooms. A brick water tower stands as a kind of campanile, providing a civic focal point at the centre of the complex, while every ward overlooks a courtyard, and a long service corridor has been cleverly tucked along one side of the site, freeing the central route for patients and medical staff, and allowing clear views out from patients’ beds. “When somebody is ill or needs care,” says Chowdhury, “one of the most important things is the mental aspect of it, not just the physical care. I think the kind of spaces you inhabit during treatment – with a view of water and trees, the sounds of birds, the feel of a breeze – goes a long way towards healing.” Odile Decq, chair of the RIBA jury, said the project “embodies an architecture of humanity and protection,” adding that it is “relevant to critical global challenges, such as unequal access to healthcare and the crushing impact of climate breakdown on vulnerable communities.” The biennial prize – delayed a year by the Covid-19 pandemic – celebrates projects from around the world that demonstrate design excellence and social impact. It has previously been awarded to a remote Brazilian school made of wood and a concrete cliff-like university building in Lima, Peru. The prize marks an important moment for architecture in Bangladesh, following the recent award of the Soane medal to Marina Tabassum, Chowdhury’s former partner, who has been developing low-cost homes for landless communities in the country’s flood-prone coastal regions. Both architects’ work offers important lessons for the global north in how to do more with less. On receipt of the prize, Chowdhury said: “I am encouraged that this may inspire more of us to commit to an architecture of care both for humanity and for nature, to rise collectively to the urgencies that we face today on a planetary scale.”",Arts/Art and design,World’s best building award won by rainwater-harvesting hospital in rural Bangladesh,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/25/riba-best-building-award-friendship-hospital-bangladesh-kashef-chowdhury-david-chipperfield-wilkinson-eyre
1/26/2022,"The parent company of the firm that runs Australia’s offshore processing regime on Nauru has failed to lodge financial reports with the corporate regulator on time, in an apparent breach of corporations law. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has confirmed that it has registered a “report of misconduct” against Rard No 3, the Brisbane-based company that wholly owns Canstruct International, following the Guardian’s inquiries. The potential penalty for filing a report late is a fine of more than $25,000.  Canstruct International has earned $1.82bn since 2017 running Australia’s sole offshore processing operation on the Pacific island. Its contract to provide “garrison and welfare services” for a little over 100 refugees and asylum seekers held on the island was extended last week – its eighth noncompetitive extension – for another six months, for $218.5m. The government’s latest figures, provided to senate estimates, state 107 people are held on Nauru: 81 of these have had their claim to refugee status formally recognised. But the Guardian understands several refugees from Australia’s former offshore system on PNG have recently been transferred to Nauru, and there are now 115 people on Nauru under Canstruct’s authority. It currently costs Australian taxpayers more than $4m a year to hold one person within the Nauru offshore regime – a little over $11,000 per person per day. Rard No 3 was required to lodge its financial report for the 2020/21 financial year by 30 November 2021: Australian companies were granted a one-month extension because of “challenges presented by Covid-19 conditions”. A spokesperson for Asic confirmed to Guardian Australia that Rard No 3 had failed to report by the extended deadline and the report had still not been lodged nearly two months later. The spokesperson also confirmed Rard No 3 had consistently lodged late every year since it began filing reports three years ago. Asic has not commenced a prosecution against Rard No 3. The spokesperson said the potential penalty for reporting late was a fine, currently $26,640. A company spokesperson told Guardian Australia in a statement: “Rard No 3 has lodged all previous financial reports and the current [2020/21] report will be lodged very soon. Canstruct has at all times been solvent, all of our statutory payments are up to date, and our books have been externally audited. “This year’s report has been slightly impacted by Covid-related delays as we rely on third-party compliance information. This information has taken longer than usual to receive. It is inaccurate to suggest that a slight delay is a criminal breach of the Corporations Act. “Canstruct has always complied with overall reporting obligations and our accountants will be ensuring that we continue to do so.” Canstruct International’s Nauru contract with the federal government contributes the vast majority of Rard No 3’s revenue and profits. Previous financial reports from Rard No 3 – also filed several months late according to the Asic register – show a dramatic increase in profits, from $69.5m after tax in 2018/19 to $101m in 2019/20. While no new asylum seeker arrivals have been sent to Nauru since 2014, the offshore operation there continues to cost Australia between $35m and $40m a month on average, the same amount it did when the detention centre held more than 1,000 people. Canstruct’s contract on Nauru has attracted public attention, and forensic questioning in the Senate. The October 2017 “letter of intent” awarded to Canstruct International was worth $8m. Less than a month after this was signed, the company won a $385m contract awarded by limited tender, meaning there was no open or competitive process to secure the contract. An auditor general’s report found while the department’s procurement process for Nauru was “largely appropriate”, it was critical of the original contract, saying “it is not clear why the department could not have secured a replacement supplier using a more competitive procurement method”. Since then, government figures show eight further amendments, all uncontested, have escalated the total cost to $1.82bn. The Guardian revealed in November that Canstruct International had just $8 in assets and had not commenced trading when it was awarded the contract.

The Canstruct group of companies, or entities associated with it, have made 11 donations to the Liberal National party in Queensland. A spokesperson for the Department of Home Affairs said the Australian government remained committed to regional processing as a key pillar of Operation Sovereign Borders. “Australia is working with Nauru to establish an enduring regional processing capability in Nauru.” In 2015, Hancock Prospecting, the mining company owned by billionaire Gina Rinehart, was fined $130,000 for failing to file financial reports on time between 2008 and 2012. The business was fined after pleading guilty to 13 counts of breaching section 319 of the Corporations Act.",News/Australia news,Parent company of Nauru offshore operator fails to file reports in apparent breach of corporations law,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/26/parent-company-of-nauru-offshore-operator-fails-to-file-reports-in-apparent-breach-of-corporations-law
1/26/2022,"Vaccination rates among Perth’s growing homeless community may be as low as 45%, according to comprehensive data collected by one service provider, raising fears the vulnerable cohort will be caught in a “perfect storm” when Western Australia does open its borders. The premier, Mark McGowan, announced last week the state would delay plans to lift the hard border on 5 February, a decision that sparked anger among some residents but was also greeted with relief by others, including some homelessness advocates.  While WA avoided a crisis of Covid deaths, homelessness became a hot-button issue amid a spate of rough sleepers dying on the streets of Perth. Real-time data collected by Shelter WA says there are now about 500 people sleeping rough in Perth, and about 1,000 people experiencing homelessness overall. Dr Andrew Davies, the chief executive of Homeless Healthcare, provides outreach healthcare services to many of those people and has carried out an audit of 522 people who were patients over the past 12 months. The data, shared with Guardian Australia, shows 32% of those patients were completely unvaccinated as at 21 January 2022. It showed 68% had received one dose and 46.7% were fully vaccinated. Only 6.5% had received a booster. About 40% of patients in the analysis were Aboriginal. The figures make for grim reading compared to the statewide rate of nearly 90% of people aged 12 and above who’ve been fully vaccinated. The Homeless Healthcare data will be sent to the WA government after it admitted last week it had not compiled figures on vaccination rates among the homeless. The data was compiled by Davies, Prof Lisa Wood of the University of Notre Dame WA, and Matthew Tuson of the Home2Health research team at the University of WA. “Two thirds (67%) of Homeless Healthcare patients have at least one chronic health condition, including high rates of conditions that are risk factors for Covid-severity (such as diabetes, heart disease, chronic respiratory illness and liver disease),” they said. “The Covid vaccination rates identified in this audit are thus of immense concern, particularly given the mounting evidence for the need for the third booster vaccine dose for better protection against the Omicron variant and its impacts on health.” Davies told Guardian Australia rough sleepers often found it difficult to adequately socially distance, isolate or quarantine. This meant they could become a “source of infection for all”, he said. Advocates say McGowan’s decision to delay the border opening means there is now an opportunity to lift vaccination rates among the vulnerable rough sleeper population. Michelle Mackenzie, the chief executive of Shelter WA, said rates among the homeless were “really scary”. Mackenzie said one issue was that although the government had established some vaccine programs targeting the homeless last year, there were also a “whole lot of people who are new to homelessness” now accessing services. She said there was a need to re-establish clinics for the homeless as well as outreach teams. “It needs to be built on what works, it needs to look at supporting frontline services who’ve got that relationship and trust,” she said. Earlier this month, a trio of leading advocates also wrote to McGowan saying they had “grave concerns” about low vaccination rates among the homeless. The letter was from the former chief executive of the Derbarl Yerrigan Health Service, Noongar man Ted Wilkes, the Ngalla Maya Aboriginal Corporation chief executive, Mervyn Eades, and veteran housing campaigner Betsy Buchanan. Jesse Noakes, a member of the House the Homeless WA campaign, said the government was right to have focused on the “threat posed to remote communities when WA finally reopens”. “But there is an even bigger crisis looming in the heart of the Perth CBD,” he said. “The most vulnerable community in WA will be caught in a perfect storm as WA’s growing COVID outbreak makes the recent border reversal moot.” Davies said there were multiple factors inhibiting the ability of Perth’s rough sleepers to get vaccinated. He said rough sleepers often had “competing priorities”, meaning if you had “nowhere to sleep then you don’t worry about being vaccinated”, and some were concerned they would have no safe place to rest and recover from vaccine side effects. Hesitancy due to past traumatic experiences in the health system or distrust of government, and relatively low rates of Covid in WA were also a factor. Davies said there was also a “handful of patients” who had said they did not need to “get vaccinated as they were paid in the region of $1,000 to get vaccinated in someone else’s name”. A WA Health spokesperson confirmed the department did not hold data on vaccination rates among the homeless. The spokesperson said the department was working with “peak bodies and service providers to assist people identified as at risk of Covid-19 disease”. “This includes people experiencing homelessness, sleeping rough or utilising emergency accommodation, who often find it difficult to isolate and/or have limited usage of mainstream health services,” the spokesperson said. The spokesperson said the department set up vaccination clinics with homelessness services in mid-2021. This was then transitioned to “a number of GPs services that specialised in working with people experiencing homelessness”. “The program has facilitated in-reach services at more than 50 sites utilised by people experiencing homelessness and provides twice weekly information to a range of organisations about current state-run and other vaccination clinics, as well as partnering with community organisations to reach this population,” the spokesperson said. “Strategies now also include a focus on particular priority groups via door to door services within areas where priority groups may reside.”",News/Australia news,‘Perfect storm’: fears for WA homeless people as data reveals low Covid vaccination rate,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/26/perfect-storm-fears-for-wa-homeless-people-as-data-reveals-low-covid-vaccination-rate
1/26/2022,"Serge Mombo, a leading football official in Gabon, has been arrested after being accused of sexually abusing young players and demanding sex as a condition of them securing places in national teams, the Guardian understands. Mombo, was re-elected as president of La Ligue de l’Estuaire, Gabon’s senior football league, in June 2021 and served as the kit man for Gabon’s senior men’s team at the African Cup of Nations in Cameroon. Mombo, a former policeman and referee, has denied the abuse claims, made by alleged victims team and witnesses to the Guardian earlier this month.  It is understood that authorities in Gabon were monitoring him during the tournament and Mombo was arrested when the team returned home to Léon Mba airport in Libreville on Tuesday night, two days after being eliminated by Burkina Faso on penalties in the last-16. He also denied claims he provided a Gabonese football coach, Patrick Assoumou Eyi, known as “Capello”, with boys to sexually abuse. Eyi, like Mombo a senior figure in the Gabonese football federation Fegafoot, is facing charges of raping minors and sexual assault after claims by alleged victims were reported by the Guardian. Eyi has denied the claims. Two other coaches in Gabon are also facing charges. Mombo said his accusers were “lying to try to dirty my image.” On 10 January, Fifa confirmed its independent ethics committee has opened an investigation into allegations of widespread sexual abuse in Gabonese football. Gabon’s president, Ali Bongo, has described the allegations of widespread sexual abuse as “a very serious matter”, with the government also announcing that it will hold a judicial investigation into possible sexual abuse against children and young people in all sports in the country. Two tennis coaches – Jean Komi Vivon and Dandhy Poaty – were also arrested this week on suspicion of alleged sexual abuse on minors and are awaiting charges.",Sport/Sport,Serge Mombo arrested over sexual abuse of young players in Gabon,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/25/serge-mombo-arrested-over-sexual-abuse-of-young-players-in-gabon
1/26/2022,"Boost your vaccinations, don whatever PPE you have to hand – the new variant Julian Fellowes has breached our shores. This time, his typing is set in late 19th-century New York. Yes, it’s Brownstone Abbey. Its official title is The Gilded Age (Sky Atlantic), but we all know what we are dealing with. There are posh people – the old families who have been in New York since it was a glint in a Dutchman’s eye. Then there are the upstart types who made buckets of stinky new money building railroads and are now busy building mansions all over Manhattan and trying to lay down tracks into smart society. We’ll call them the Shamderbilts. And then there are servants, who live beneath these posh people and bitch about them whenever the restraining influence of the butler is absent. We lay our scene in Central Park. It is 1882 it’s full of sheep. They turn and run from the camera. It is a wise move, all things considered.  The first note struck is a sorrowful one. Miss Marian Brook (Louisa Jacobson, who is still young and will survive the dialogue that is soon to come her way) learns that the death of her father, Henry, has left her penniless and that she will be thrown on the mercy of her two aunts. “Don’t worry, Mr Riggs,” she says, smiling bravely at the handsome young solicitor who has had to break the news. “I’m not beaten yet!” “At the risk of impertinence,” he replies, because Fellowes knows “impertinence” is a very 1882 word, “I’d say you are a long way from being beaten, Miss Brook.” Get used to this kind of drivelling redundancy, folks, because there is an awful lot of it. Also, everyone is using that strange voice Americans do to indicate that they are posh in the past – it mixes precise diction with a strained tone, as if they are all having a hard time on the loo. Which, actually – well, never mind. We needn’t labour the point. Marian’s aunts (or “auurahnts” as it is pronounced in 1882) are Cynthia Nixon as Ada Brook, presumably as punishment for letting And Just Like That … go ahead, and Christine Baranski – who must have a very persuasive agent – as Agnes van Rhijn. ’Tis Agnes who holds the purse strings and is most conscious of the standards to be upheld by her and her peers. She and they are aghast at the arrival of the Russells. Mr George (Morgan Spector) is a robber baron (“I may be a bastard, but you are a fool” is a thing he says) and has built his castle opposite Agnes’s elegant home, much to her displeasure. His wife (Carrie Coon) is a social climber who has her finger on the pulse. “We cannot succeed in this town without Mrs Astor’s approval, I know that much,” she tells George when he is taking a brief break from intimidating aldermen and crushing rivals under the weight of his fortune. All of human life is here. Not in any credible way – just here. Marian acquires a young black woman, Peggy Scott (Denée Benton), as a friend on her journey to her aaughuhaunts. She is taken on as a live-in secretary by Agnes so Fellowes can develop as nuanced a portrait of race relations in turn-of-the-century New York as he does of class. It is agony, but no more so than the rest. There is a younger set – indistinguishable apart from Agnes’s son Oscar and John Adams (John Quincy Adams’s great-grandson, dontcha know), who have a shared feature that will upset Mama no end when she finds out – who care not a jot for convention, so that love across the new/old money divide can play out. “I only ask that you never break your own moral code,” says Aunt Ada, whom I suspect should not be allowed to cross Fifth Avenue unaided. “How wise, Aunt Ada!” says Marian. I will have to look up whether taking the piss had been invented by 1882. And there are secrets among the servants. Miss Turner hates Mrs Russell and is bidding for an affair with Mr Russell. The Van Rhijn butler Bannister (Simon Jones) says he has nothing to hide, which makes me suspect he has something to hide. In short, it’s just what HBO ordered from the man who by now is surely actually churning this stuff out in his sleep rather than simply giving the faultless impression of it.",Arts/Television & radio,The Gilded Age review – Julian Fellowes’ stinky rich New Yorkers are sheer agony,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/25/the-gilded-age-review-julian-fellowes-stinky-rich-new-yorkers-are-sheer-agony
1/26/2022,"Vítor Pereira has emerged as Farhad Moshiri’s favoured choice to succeed Rafael Benítez as Everton manager and to lead the club’s fight against a first relegation in 71 years. The former Porto and Fenerbahce manager is available having been sacked by the Turkish club in December after only five months in charge. His appointment is viewed as a major gamble by some members of the Everton hierarchy, given his lack of Premier League experience and his relegation from the second tier of the Bundesliga with 1860 Munich, but it is the club’s erratic majority shareholder who will ultimately make the critical decision.  Moshiri, along with business associate Alisher Usmanov, has held talks this week with Pereira, who was overlooked for the Everton job in 2013 when Roberto Martinez replaced David Moyes and again in 2019 when Carlo Ancelotti succeeded Marco Silva. Frank Lampard has also held discussions over the vacancy but the Portuguese coach, 53, is the leading candidate for Everton’s billionaire owner. Despite Wayne Rooney having his admirers on Everton’s board, there has been no formal approach for the Derby manager. Pereira could be offered a contract containing a break clause at the end of the season in the event of Everton’s first relegation since 1951, according to reports in Portugal. That would reflect both the risk of his appointment and the precariousness of Everton’s Premier League position, with the team four points above the relegation zone after losing 10 of their past 14 league games. Pereira has won league titles with Porto and Olympiakos, who were both reigning champions when he took over, and at Shanghai SIPG during a three-year spell with the Chinese club. He has also had short-lived stints in Saudi Arabia with Al Ahli, Fenerbahce twice and 1860 Munich who, in echoes of Everton’s situation, were in relegation trouble when he arrived in January 2017. They went down five months later. The Portuguese coach would be Moshiri’s sixth permanent managerial appointment in six years and unlikely to silence criticism of the club’s chaotic decline among their fans, some of whom took their protests to the Liver Building on Tuesday. A small group of Evertonians gathered outside the city’s iconic building, which is part-owned by Moshiri and serves as Everton’s administrative headquarters, as part of co-ordinated protests at the way the club has been run by the majority shareholder. Banners proclaiming: “Moshiri: If you want success then change this mess”, “Board of Failure” and “Kia not welcome” were on display outside the Liver Building. Similar banners were hung on gates at Goodison Park on Monday, and followed on from a sit-in protest after Saturday’s defeat by Aston Villa. The gathering was part of the #27yearscampaign – a reference to Everton’s current trophy drought – that involves several supporters groups. The campaign later apologised for not communicating its decision to head to Everton’s HQ with other fans. Its objectives include asking Moshiri to “listen, engage and act”, to “replace the existing board with people who have proven commercial and football expertise” and to “allow those professionals to do their jobs without interference”. The “Kia not welcome” banner is a response to agent Kia Joorabchian, a close friend of Moshiri, and his influence on numerous transfer dealings at Everton.",Sport/Football,Vítor Pereira is Farhad Moshiri’s No 1 choice to replace Benítez at Everton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/25/vitor-pereira-is-farhad-moshiris-no-1-choice-to-replace-benitez-at-everton
