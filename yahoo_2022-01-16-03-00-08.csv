1/16/2022,"Stewart Rhodes, founder of Oath Keepers, was charged with seditious conspiracy in connection to the Capitol riot. His estranged wife Tasha Adams said that he is a ""complete sociopath."" Adams said that she felt Rhodes was personally dangerous to her and her family, and also to the country. The estranged wife of Stewart Rhodes, the leader of the far-right group Oath Keepers, said he is a ""complete sociopath."" Rhodes' wife Tasha Adams made the comments in an interview with CNN on Friday, a day after Rhodes was charged with seditious conspiracy in connection to the Capitol riot. Insider's Oma Seddiq and Sonam Sheth wrote that it's the most significant arrest yet and marks the first time that federal prosecutors have brought sedition charges in connection to the Justice Department's sprawling investigation into the deadly January 6, 2021, Capitol siege. Adams said she was relieved to hear he was indicted, as she ""lived in fear"" of him showing up at her house. ""Knowing we were safe and my kids were safe and my kids' school doesn't have to worry, that was a relief I didn't know existed,"" she said. Adams told CNN host John Berman that she felt Rhodes was dangerous to her and her family, and the country. ""He is very dangerous. He lives very much in his own head,"" Adams said on CNN. ""He sees himself as a great leader. He almost has his own mythology of himself and I think he almost made it come true, seeing himself as some sort of figure in history, and it sort of happened."" ""He's a complete sociopath. He does not feel empathy for anyone around him at all,"" she added. Tasha Adams and Stewart Rhodes' divorce has been pending for more than three years. In April of last year, Adams set up a GoFundMe page asking for $30,000 in donations to fund their divorce. ""Though I can't talk about the details of my marriage here, I can tell you that it was likely about exactly what you're picturing, but probably quite a bit weirder,"" Adams wrote on the GoFundMe page. She also wrote that the process of divorcing her husband was difficult as he was someone who ""commands their own private army."" Rhodes, an Army veteran, founded the Oath Keepers in 2019. The far-right group recruits active and former military and law enforcement officers who swear an oath to defend the US Constitution. His arrest on Thursday marked the first time that federal prosecutors have brought sedition charges in connection to the events of January 6. Rhodes has said he was at the Capitol that day but did not enter the building, according to The Washington Post. Tasha Adams told CNN that she has been talking to the House select committee investigating the Capitol attack, and said that she believed her husband ""planned it very carefully."" She said that she believed Rhodes had been calculating in his decision to not enter the Capitol building so that he would not be implicated. ""I see his fingerprints all over it,"" she said. Adams and Rhodes, who met in Las Vegas, married in 1994 and have six children together, according to Buzzfeed News.

1/16/2022,"BREMERTON — The USS Kitty Hawk, the nation's last oil-fired aircraft carrier, departed Bremerton on Saturday for a 16,000-mile journey around South America for its ultimate fate: scrapping at a Texas shipyard. Onlookers, many of them former sailors aboard the ""Battle Cat,"" watched as tugs pulled the rugged warship into Sinclair Inlet on a foggy Saturday morning. At more than 1,000 feet long, the Kitty Hawk won't fit in the Panama Canal, so the warship will be tugged through the Strait of Magellan en route to Brownsville, Texas. Corey Urband, a Navy veteran who became a machinist at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, was among those old sailors gathered to see it go. Many swapped stories of being thrust onto a Navy ship, put in charge of millions in equipment and the care of thousands of lives. “As hard as life was on this ship, it’s part of my history,” said Urband, who served from 1992 to 1996 as a machinist’s mate. “While most people were graduating from high school and college, I was 30 feet below the waterline, halfway around the world from home.” For Rich Bratlee, an electrician from Spanaway, the Kitty Hawk was an eye-opening rite of passage. The 6,000 sailors of the Kitty Hawk were double the size of his hometown in Montana. “Quite a culture shock,” said Bratlee, who served from 1979-1983 and watched the ship depart Bremerton on Saturday. “I’ve come a long ways since being a kid on a farm.” The massive ship had two escalators to help move around thousands of sailors more easily. Yet it never seemed to work well, sailors say. At times too many people would propel the escalator forward, spilling those at the bottom into a pileup. “The were nothing but a pain,” Bratlee said. The Kitty Hawk follows from Bremerton's mothball fleet the USS Constellation, USS Independence and USS Ranger, which were all dismantled at the same place: International Shipbreaking Ltd. The company bought the warship, along with fellow carrier USS John F. Kennedy, for the stately price of one cent. ""The contract values reflect that the contracted company will benefit from the subsequent sale of scrap steel, iron, and non-ferrous metal ores,"" said Alan Baribeau, a spokesman for the Naval Sea Systems Command. More: USS Kitty Hawk veterans devastated the aircraft carrier is headed for the scrapyard The Kitty Hawk got a rare visit to one of the Navy's only two carrier dry docks in 2021 so that its marine growth could be scraped off. Under an agreement with the state, Suquamish Tribe and other groups, the ship's hull could not be cleaned in Sinclair Inlet after a previous carrier's scrubbing sparked environmental concerns. More: Former Kitty Hawk aircraft carrier leaves dry dock in Bremerton The Kitty Hawk participated in combat operations during the nation's wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq. The Kitty Hawk was also the fleet's only permanently forward-deployed carrier in Yokosuka, Japan, from 1998 to 2008. It was decommissioned a year later and has been in mothballs in Bremerton until this year. Five former aircraft carriers have been turned into museums, but the Kitty Hawk will not be one of them. Though many sailors and others advocated for its preservation, the Navy declined to pursue that course. Advocates worried that there will never be another carrier preserved for posterity, as those of the nuclear-powered era must be mangled to remove all radioactive remnants. The San Diego-ported USS Midway, a flattop that served from 1945 to 1992, was the last the Navy turned into a museum.
