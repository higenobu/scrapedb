1/3/2022,"On a day of alarming polling about attitudes to political violence and fears for US democracy, and as the first anniversary of the Capitol attack approached, a Republican member of the House committee investigating the events of 6 January 2021 had a stark warning for her party.  “Our party has to choose,” Liz Cheney told CBS’s Face the Nation. “We can either be loyal to Donald Trump or we can be loyal to the constitution, but we cannot be both.” Trump supporters attacked Congress in an attempt to stop certification of his defeat by Joe Biden, which Trump maintains without evidence was the result of electoral fraud. Five people died around a riot in which a mob roamed the Capitol, searching for lawmakers to capture and possibly kill. On Sunday, Cheney and Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the committee chairman, again discussed the possibility of a criminal referral for Trump over his failure to attempt to stop the riot or for his obstruction of the investigation. Speaking to ABC’s This Week, Cheney said there were “potential criminal statutes at issue here, but I think that there’s absolutely no question that it was a dereliction of duty. And I think one of the things the committee needs to look at is … a legislative purpose, is whether we need enhanced penalties for that kind of dereliction of duty.” Thompson said subpoenas could be served on Republicans in Congress who refuse to comply with information requests of the kind which have led to a charge of criminal contempt of Congress for Steve Bannon, Trump’s former strategist, and a recommendation of such a charge for Mark Meadows, Trump’s chief of staff. The Democrat told NBC’s Meet the Press the committee was examining whether it could issue subpoenas to members of Congress, immediately Jim Jordan of Ohio and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania. “I think there are some questions of whether we have the authority to do it,” Thompson said. “If the authorities are there, there’ll be no reluctance on our part.” Last month, the committee asked Jordan for testimony about conversations with Trump on 6 January. Jordan told Fox News he had “real concerns” about the credibility of the panel. Perry was asked for testimony about attempts to replace Jeffrey Rosen, acting head of the justice department, with Jeffrey Clark, an official who tried to help overturn Trump’s defeat. Perry called the committee “illegitimate, and not duly constituted”. A court has ruled that the panel is legitimate and entitled to see White House records Trump is trying to shield, an argument that has reached the supreme court. Sunday saw a rash of polls marking the anniversary of 6 January. CBS found that 68% of Americans saw the Capitol attack as a sign of increasing political violence, and that 66% thought democracy itself was threatened. When respondents were asked if violence would be justifiable to achieve various political ends, the poll returned an average of around 30%. A survey by the Washington Post and the University of Maryland said more than a third of Americans said violence against the government could be justified. ABC News and Ipsos found that 52% of Republicans said the Capitol rioters were trying to protect democracy. Other polling has shown clear majorities among Republicans in believing Trump’s lie about electoral fraud and distrust of federal elections. On CNN’s State of the Union, Larry Hogan, Maryland governor and a moderate Republican with an eye on the presidential nomination, said: “Frankly, it’s crazy that that many people believe things that simply aren’t true. “There’s been an amazing amount of disinformation that’s been spread over the past year. And many people are consuming that disinformation and believing it as if it’s fact. To think the violent protesters who attacked the Capitol, our seat of democracy, on 6 January was just tourists looking at statues? It’s insane that anyone could watch that on television and believe that’s what happened.” Cheney told CBS the blame lay squarely with her own party. “Far too many Republicans are trying to enable the former president, embrace the former president or look the other way and hope that the former president goes away, or trying to obstruct the activities of this committee, but we won’t be deterred. At the end of the day, the facts matter, the truth matters.” Her host, Margaret Brennan, pointed out that Republicans across the US, some in states where Trump’s attempt to steal the election was repulsed, are changing election laws to their advantage. “We’ve got to be grounded on the rule of law,” Cheney said. “We’ve got to be grounded on fidelity of the constitution … So I think for people all across the country, they need to recognise how important their vote is for their voices. They’ve got to elect serious people who are going to defend the constitution, not simply do the bidding of Donald Trump.” Cheney faces a primary challenger doing Trump’s bidding and enjoying his backing. The other Republican on the 6 January committee, Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, will retire in November rather than fight such a battle of his own. Cheney said she was “confident people of Wyoming will not choose loyalty to one man as dangerous as Donald Trump”, and that she will secure re-election. She also notably did not say no when she was asked if she would run against Trump if he sought the nomination next time. On ABC, Cheney was asked if she agreed with Hillary Clinton, who has said a second Trump presidency could end US democracy. “I do,” Cheney said. “I think it is critically important, given everything we know about the lines that he was willing to cross. “… We entrust the survival of our republic into the hands of the chief executive, and when a president refuses to tell the mob to stop, when he refuses to defend any of the co-ordinate branches of government, he cannot be trusted.”",News/US news,Capitol attack: Cheney says Republicans must choose between Trump and truth,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/02/capitol-attack-liz-cheney-republicans-choose-trump-or-truth
1/3/2022,"The family of an autistic man confined to an apartment and fed through a hatch are planning a legal challenge against his conditions, in a case that will increase pressure on the government to end the practice of keeping people with severe learning disabilities in “modern-day asylums”. Nicola, whose 24-year-old son has been detained under the Mental Health Act since September 2017 at Cheadle Royal hospital in Cheshire, said his care is “worse than being in prison” and “people wouldn’t treat an animal” as badly.  She has appointed lawyers at Irwin Mitchell to explore a legal challenge to his circumstances which include constant monitoring by CCTV and outdoor access into a fenced-off garden at the facility which is run by the private Priory Group. “We fully appreciate that my son has complex needs but he’s being treated terribly,” she said. “He’s locked away from the world and has no physical contact with anyone.” He also has a learning disability and Tourette syndrome and has been treated for aggression and anxiety. “I can’t even hold his hand or hug him because of the conditions he’s kept in,” his mother said. “Every time I see him it breaks my heart. He has no quality of life, he just exists.” Campaigners are calling for greater efforts to provide care in the community for people like Nicola’s son and say about 2,000 people are held in such “assessment and treatment units (ATUs)” in hospitals, with about half of them having been there for at least two years. The placements are expensive partly because they require so many staff. Mencap, a learning disability charity, said many of the people in inpatient units ended up there because of the lack of funding for social care and not because they have a genuine need for inpatient mental health care. “The government ​must treat this scandal with the urgency that’s needed,” said Dan Scorer, head of policy at the charity. He said ministers had “broken promise after promise to ​close beds and support people in the ​community”. The standard of some care homes for people with learning disabilities is also under growing scrutiny. In October, the Guardian revealed how conditions at Berkeley House, a care home in Kent run by a private chain, Achieve Together, declined so badly families were given less than a day’s notice of its closure. Inspectors from the Care Quality Commission found residents “living in inhumane conditions”, according to a recently completed inspection report. There was no toilet roll and “faeces was found on two people’s bedding, pillows and another person’s chair”. One resident had no bedding at all and staff had damaged residents’ furniture. Inspectors “observed a staff member pushing and forcing a person to sit in their wheelchair against their will” and others using derogatory language. There were not enough qualified staff, one bedroom stank of urine and safeguarding incidents went unreported. “Staff spoke with people in a harsh tone and were focused on tasks rather than engaging with people to meet their emotional needs,” the inspectors reported, before labelling the facility “inadequate” and triggering its closure. A spokesperson for Achieve Together, which is ultimately owned by an international investment fund, said: “We unreservedly apologise for the unacceptable shortcomings … We are clear that the provision fell way below the high standards that the people we support rightly expect and deserve, and that we know we can provide.” The cases come a decade after the Winterbourne View scandal, in which BBC Panorama exposed the abuse of people with learning disabilities in a private hospital in Gloucestershire. Kirsty Stuart, a public law and human rights lawyer at Irwin Mitchell representing Nicola and her son, known as patient A, said she was now representing 25 other families whose loved ones are in ATUs. “They feel they have no option but to seek legal advice in order for their loved ones to receive the care they deserve,” she said. “We call on the Priory, the CCG and local authority to work with ourselves and Patient A’s family to reach an agreement over his care, which the family believe should be in the community as this would give him the best quality of life.” Liverpool city council said it could not comment on individual cases. A spokesperson for the Priory Group said it was committed to “ensuring well-planned transfers to the most appropriate community settings whenever they become available” but said: “Some individuals with highly complex behaviours, and detained under the Mental Health Act, can be difficult to place despite all parties working very hard over a long period of time to find the right setting.” It said care was continually reviewed to ensure the “least restrictive setting possible”. A spokesperson for the Department for Health and Social Care said: “We are determined to continue reducing the number of autistic people and people with a learning disability in mental health hospitals as well as the reliance on inpatient care. That’s why we are investing in community services and supporting discharges with £90m of additional funding this financial year.” NHS Liverpool clinical commissioning group has been contacted for comment.",News/Society,Family of autistic man plan legal challenge over care conditions,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/02/family-of-autistic-man-plan-legal-challenge-over-care-conditions
1/3/2022,"The US government’s top medical adviser, Dr Anthony Fauci, has joined a growing body of experts who say hospitalisation figures form a better guide to the severity of the Omicron coronavirus variant than the traditional case-count of new infections.  Referring to the Omicron surge in the US as a “tsunami”, Fauci also cautioned the public not to be fooled by preliminary data suggesting the variant lacks the severity of earlier Covid-19 variants, such as Delta. “You have a virus that looks like it might be less severe, at least from data we’ve gathered from South Africa, the UK and even some from preliminary data from here in the US,” he told CNN’s State of the Union. “It’s a very interesting, somewhat complicated issue … so many people are getting infected that the net amount, the total amount of people that will require hospitalisation, might be up. We can’t be complacent in these reports. We’re still going to get a lot of hospitalisations.” On ABC’s This Week, Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was asked if it was time to focus less on just the case count, which has soared close to 500,000 reported new daily infections. A number of experts have questioned if such reports cause unnecessary worry, and suggest deaths and hospitalisation data should better inform mitigation efforts. “The answer is, overall, yes,” Fauci said. “This is particularly relevant if you’re having an infection that is much, much more asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic, particularly in people who are vaccinated and boosted. “The real bottom line that you want to be concerned about is, are we getting protected by the vaccines from severe disease leading to hospitalisation?” The Biden administration has made improving vaccination rates a priority but concedes progress is slower than it would like. Fewer than 25% of US children are vaccinated, pediatric hospital admissions are surging and nationally only 62% of eligible residents are fully vaccinated with barely a third receiving a booster. “I’m still very concerned about the tens of millions of people who are not vaccinated at all because even though many of them are going to get asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic, a fair number of them are going to get severe disease,” Fauci said. Surging infection rates, Fauci told CNN, will likely cause disruption to everyday life, already evidenced in pressure on healthcare in several states and in other areas such as education and public transport. A number of universities and school districts will begin 2022 online and in New York City several subway lines have been suspended through staff shortages. Fauci said those concerns contributed to the decision by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) last week to reduce the recommended isolation period for those who have tested positive but are asymptomatic from 10 days to five. “You’re certainly gonna see stresses on the system, the system being people with any kind of jobs, particularly with critical jobs, to keep society functioning normally. We already know there are reports from fire departments, from police departments in different cities, that sometimes 30% of the people are ill. “The CDC is trying to get a position where people without symptoms who are infected, that you can get them back to work a little bit earlier if they remain without symptoms.” But he rejected criticism that the change was sparked by economic pressure rather than science. “In the second half of a 10-day period, which would normally be a 10-day isolation period, the likelihood of transmissibility is considerably lower,” he said. “For that reason, the CDC made the judgement that it would be relatively low risk to get people out. “You’re right [that] people are concerned about, ‘Why not test people at that time?’ I myself feel that that’s a reasonable thing to do. I believe that the CDC soon will be coming out with more clarification of that since it obviously has generated a number of questions about that five-day period.” The new mayor of New York, Eric Adams, said he thought the city was doing “an amazing job” of reacting to the shifting challenges of the pandemic, including transportation issues and having one-fifth of police out sick. “We are pivoting based on where the urgency is located. We’re not taking it one-size-fits-all, we’re thinking about it and making the right moves and decisions,” he told ABC. “I was with my police commissioner. We have a 20% sick rate but now we have officers coming back after the five days. “But we can’t live through variants. We spent $11tn on Covid and we don’t have another $11tn, so our lives can’t be based on what’s the new variant. No. We have to figure out, how do we adjust? “I say to those who are not vaccinated, ‘Stop it. It’s time to get vaccinated. It’s time to have the booster shots. You’re endangering yourself and you’re endangering the public and your family as well.’”",News/US news,Fauci agrees hospitalization figures a better guide to Omicron than case count ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/02/fauci-covid-omicron-hospitalizations-case-count
1/3/2022,"More than 137,000 new Covid cases have been reported for England and Wales on Sunday, official data reveals. Figures have not been reported for Scotland or Northern Ireland due to the new year weekend, but in the past 24 hours 137,583 new Covid cases have been reported for England and Wales combined. The figures for England and Wales also show that there were another 73 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.  On Saturday cases in England alone hit 162,572, a new record high for daily reported cases. However, figures tend to be lower on Sundays and early in the week as a result of fewer tests being taken over the weekend. Daily case numbers refer to cases by date reported, only cover infections picked up by testing and do not include reinfections – although the Guardian understands these may be included from the end of January – meaning the true number of infections will be higher still. Sir David Spiegelhalter, who is a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), has said the UK’s daily Covid infections could be closer to 500,000 given reinfections are not counted and testing is limited. According to data from the Zoe Covid study, there were 205,235 new symptomatic cases of Covid alone in the UK on New Year’s Eve, based on PCR and lateral flow test data as of two days ago, with almost 2.4 million people predicted to currently have symptomatic Covid. Data on hospital admissions and patients in hospital with Covid was not updated on Sunday, but both have been increasing. On 29 December, 2,370 Covid patients were admitted, the highest figure since late January last year and a 90% rise on the figure the week before. According to official data for England, while cases began rising sooner among younger age groups, since around the middle of last month they have also been rising rapidly in those over the age of 60. The spread of Covid into older age groups is of concern as it is not yet clear how this may affect the number of people requiring hospital care.",News/World news,"More than 137,000 new Covid cases reported in England and Wales on Sunday",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/02/more-than-137000-new-covid-cases-reported-in-england-and-wales-on-sunday
1/3/2022,"Good poo donors are so hard to find they’re sometimes called “unicorns”. These elusive, healthy creatures service a market for faecal transplants that is growing rapidly as evidence of its benefits mounts. Emerging science shows that a human’s microbiome – their constellation of gut microbes – has a far greater effect on health than anyone previously imagined. This enormous ecosystem we host in our bodies includes bacteria, fungi, viruses and more.  The collective genetic material in the microbiome performs myriad functions that affect our mood, our immunity, and our physical and mental health. Crappy western diets and antibiotics are depleting our microbiota. And in some cases, a person’s microbiome is disordered enough that it needs a little boost from someone else’s. Restoring them to health has become a very serious scientific endeavour, as the diversity of our gut bacteria is linked to everything from depression to how we respond to cancer treatment. The transfer of healthy stool into the gastrointestinal tract of an unhealthy recipient has been proven to treat people with intestinal conditions, including the superbug Clostridium difficile colitis, or C diff – which can cause diarrhoea, sepsis and even death. But as scientific understanding of the microbiome improves, the possibilities of faecal transplants are expanding. Now researchers are working on a “super stool” – a poo pellet you can eat that mimics a so-called unicorn’s special abilities. BiomeBank’s office is located in a hub in the suburbs of Adelaide. Chief medical officer Sam Costello and chief executive Thomas Mitchell wear lanyards emblazoned with depictions of bacteria – and Costello jokes that an organic-looking spill on his is probably a real-life experiment. The biotech company has been on a unicorn hunt. This place is home to a stool bank – and it’s a place where designer poo transplants are made. There’s a special donor room (a glorified toilet) where poo donations are received. There’s a lab with an anaerobic work station, where donors’ bacteria strains are put into a “secret sauce” to grow and then isolate strains. Those strains are categorised and catalogued for future use. BiomeBank’s head of donor screening, Dr Emily Tucker, says there’s a long list of requirements for a stool donor. They have to be healthy, obviously. They have to be screened for infections. A detailed history of their medical, travel and antibiotic history is taken. Those who make it through all the assessments are enrolled for an eight-week program where they have to turn up on time, fill out a questionnaire, then (ahem) make a deposit inside a special room. So what happens if there aren’t enough unicorns? That question inspired BiomeBank’s latest endeavour – to replicate the contents of a unicorn’s guts. People are building libraries of the very best that poo has to offer, and BiomeBank is part of the effort to categorise premium stool strains. Costello, a gastroenterologist, says that humans historically had much more diverse microbiota. We lived more closely with other people and with animals, and we ate more unprocessed food. There’s evidence, he says, that this depletion is evident across society – particularly western society. He describes a “microbial extinction event” in the modern world. As on Earth, so it is in our intestinal system – we’re living with the consequences of a hollowed-out ecosystem. Mitchell explains that in BiomeBank’s first generation of microbial therapy they extracted the right bacteria, freeze dried it and put it in a capsule. Patients can take it orally to treat specific infections. This generation has already been rolled out in hospitals, and, if approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, it will be the first microbial therapy in the world approved as a biologic (it currently has provisional approval). Then there’s the second generation – a replication. Think of the unicorns as Adam and Eve types, but their genomic sequences can be reproduced. You can grow them. Isolate them. Identify them, name them, put them in a library, and gradually build up knowledge about what each strand can do. And when you hit a vein of gold – a bacterial strain that sorts out a deficiency in someone’s microbiota – you scale it. Then you put it that bespoke bacterial recipe in a capsule that someone else swallows. “It’s a new way to treat disease,” Mitchell says. “It’s a little factory.” From the moment we’re born, and throughout our lives, our microbiota are shaped by our environmental and dietary inputs. Babies born by caesarean section have a different mix to those delivered vaginally, a major study has found. The C-section babies pick up more strains from the hospital, which could explain higher rates of immune problems such as asthma and allergies in those babies. Prof Felice Jacka, director of Deakin University’s Food and Mood Centre, is a nutritional psychiatrist (and the author of There’s a Zoo in My Poo, which features recipes for “better bog burgers”, “farty toast” and “zoo poo stew”). The centre examines the “mindbogglingly complex” links between diet, gut and brain health. “You have all these organisms that interact with each other in a way that’s impossible to map at this stage,” she says. “We’re still really at the beginning of working out what microbiota can do.” And Jacka’s a fan of the “super stool” plan, not least because “giving people other people’s shit” has a bit of the icks about it. “It’s absolutely worth doing,” she says. “Finding those super donors is hard. Only about 3% of people qualify … Those super poopers are kind of rare, so it you can distill that, if BiomeBank can come up with a stool equivalent, it’d be awesome.” Jacka, as one of the world’s top microbiome experts, says scientists are still working out exactly how the gut-brain axis works, how the microbiome affects health, and how it can be manipulated. There are dozens of studies under way in Australia, but existing research has already shown that a bad diet – like the standard American diet – leads to increased inflammation in the body, which means a higher risk of cancer. A team from the Imperial College London and the University of Pittsburgh compared African Americans to rural South Africans. The volunteers were tested, then swapped diets and were tested again. After just two weeks on the fibre-rich rural diet, the Americans had significantly less colon inflammation and a lower cancer risk. Unfortunately, the rural group went the other way. The Food and Mood Centre is studying nutrition and its effect on depression, on muscle and heart health, on psychotic disorders, on post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders and a host of other health concerns. Jacka nominates cancer research as one of the most exciting fields in microbiome studies. Data show better responses to treatment, particularly immunotherapy, in people with more diverse gut microbes. But she warns much research is still nascent, and that industries out to make a buck are capitalising on it too quickly, selling products with vague promises of promoting “gut health”. “Be aware, keep an open mind, but not so open your brain falls out. Or your wallet, more to the point,” she advises. The University of Sydney’s Microbiome Research Centre is studying the effect of the microbiome on cancer, women and children’s health, infection, immunity, inflammation, critical care, and mental health and neuroscience. The centre’s director, Prof Emad El-Omar, says there while there is advanced research showing the benefit of a more diverse microbiome (and therefore faecal transplants) when dealing with C diff, in other disorders researchers are still working through what works, and how. He says the the number of genes in these microorganisms dwarfs that of the human genome. “It’s a very exciting field, but there’s still a bit of work to be done to maximise the benefit for all humanity.” And he agrees with Jacka, that the “wellness” industry is sometimes jumping the gun on “gut health”. At this stage, poo transplants are only recommended, or useful, in very specific cases. But everyone can improve their microbiome – and you don’t need supplements. Jacka says for most people changing their diet is enough to change their bacteria. “To have what we understand to be a healthy microbiota, where the microbes present are associated with healthy conditions and those that aren’t present that are associated with unhealthy conditions, we already know what you should do,” she says. “Eat lots of plants, different types of plants, different-coloured plants and throw in some fermented foods.” Think kimchi, kombucha and sauerkraut. And think fibre. Jacka says that with typical western diets your gut microbiota is so “weak, wan, pale and deficient” that it just can’t cope with fibre. Then when people try to incorporate more roughage, they get gas or a stomach ache. Some people then mistakenly think they have irritable bowel syndrome or a gluten intolerance and back off the fibrous foods. You have to start gently, she says. Increase the amount and type of fibre gradually. “The answer to a problem with beans,” she says, “is actually more beans”. Costello says BiomeBank hopes to be “part of the global effort work to solve this big problem, which is this loss of microbial diversity associated with disease … on a massive scale”. “We see it as a modern pandemic,” Costello says. And there is plenty of work still to be done. At BiomeBank, researchers are beginning to understand the microbiome strains in frozen storage. Then there are the many strains yet to be understood – we don’t know yet what they might one day be capable of. Costello and Mitchell call that library of the known and unknown, next door to the unicorns’ toilet, the “cave of wonders”.",News/Australia news,Super poo: the emerging science of stool transplants and designer gut bacteria,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/03/super-poo-the-emerging-science-of-stool-transplants-and-designer-gut-bacteria
1/3/2022,"Is it possible to let that go? Is there someone else who can help you? Could you defer it for a week? To each of these queries and other similar ones, Mary gave a firm shake of the head and an even firmer “no”.  This was a pattern. Our sessions had a real “groundhog day” feel to them. Mary would arrive looking harassed and tired, tell me how frantic her week had been and how many things there were still to do. We tried problem solving and planning, prioritising and all manner of productivity hacks. Nothing shifted. Mary’s struggle was also too familiar. She reminded me of many other high-achieving people I have worked with who had sought help for exhaustion, or health difficulties or burnout. One of their hallmarks is seemingly endless resources of grit. American psychologist Angela Duckworth is well known for her research on the phenomenon of grit: Grit entails working strenuously toward challenges, maintaining effort and interest over years despite failure, adversity and plateaus in progress. Her studies indicate that grit is more predictive of success and achievement in areas like education and business than intelligence or natural ability. Greater grit is associated with people sticking it out through difficult periods and staying longer in a job. Interestingly, research also indicates that those with higher grit are happier and more satisfied with their lives. This finding certainly didn’t hold true for Mary. Is there a downside to too much grit? A 2015 study found that people with high levels of grit often persist with difficult tasks to their own detriment. Participants had to solve as many puzzles as they could – but some of the puzzles were unsolvable. Grittier individuals spent more time attempting to solve unsolvable puzzles and solved fewer overall than their less gritty counterparts. The researchers’ conclusion? There is value in knowing when to quit. Discussing this knowledge at an intellectual level is one thing. Translating it into a felt sense that some change is possible is much harder. One of the shifts in my work with Mary came after a good discussion about strengths and vulnerabilities. Often we use our strengths to protect ourselves from experiencing our vulnerabilities. Perhaps I over-work to keep feelings of vulnerability at bay, or book myself up with social engagements to avoid noticing I’m feeling alone. It’s smart coping, but it has a downside. Overusing strengths can mean we can rely on them too much, or use them too often, or miss noticing that they are not so helpful any more. Mary’s grit was definitely a strength and it was definitely over used. Gently, to make sure we didn’t trigger too much emotional distress, we brainstormed what the grit might be protecting her from. Mary’s protections again reminded me of other high achievers: protecting her from asking for help; protecting her from feeling vulnerable or not in control; protecting her from feeling that she had somehow failed if she didn’t nail every challenge. Another important insight was helping Mary to recognise that she is living and working in an environment that reinforces grit. Our western culture celebrates the qualities of persistence and striving. We love stories of people triumphing over adversity of all kinds. We are also quick to criticise anyone who appears to “give up”. The great basketball player Michael Jordan declared: “If you quit once it becomes a habit. Never quit.” Not persevering is seen as the “soft option” or taking the easy road out. For Mary, moving away from too much grit then needed to be an individual journey but also a shared experience. Another young woman I worked with who was a successful athlete gave a presentation on grit to her team and coaches to spark better conversations about persevering and also recovery, when to push and when to pause. When we speak freely about our struggles with family, colleagues and friends, we are better able to identify when someone else, or ourselves, might need a gentle nudge towards pausing instead of pushing. This means we don’t need to walk the path alone. We know from psychological research that we are more likely to succeed and lift our wellbeing with new behaviours if we seek to “add” rather than eliminate (ie set ourselves an “approach” goal rather than an “avoidance” goal). Supporting Mary to practise some active “letting go” , asking for help, learning to ease up on how much she could get done in a day, and to find new hobbies that are more about experiences and being rather than achievements all helped to create some small shifts. And my athlete pulled back from competitions for a period of time to study and have more time with friends. When she returned, her form and performance were better than ever. If you have too much grit, I hope reading this gives you permission to gently check in with yourself (and maybe others). Is this useful for me? When is it not? What else could I do instead? And what other strategies might I learn that enhance my wellbeing rather than deplete it? Interested in how “gritty” you are? Take Angela Duckworth’s grit survey here.

1/3/2022,"The last couple of years have surely reminded us that nobody can predict the future and nobody knows what’s coming around the corner. We can safely assume, however, that whatever troubles befall us, artists will struggle on, fighting the good fight, telling stories and taking us to places of imagination and illumination. As always, the new year offers a range of Australian films to look forward to. Here are 10 of them.  Director: Ivan Sen Ivan Sen – the director of Mystery Road, Beneath Clouds and Toomelah – behind the wheel of a sumptuous-looking cyberpunk drama set in a futuristic Hong Kong? Yes please! Ryan Kwanten leads the cast as an assassin romantically drawn to a nightclub singer (Jillian Nguyen) and periodically given lecture-like monologues from a scuffy, intellectual-looking Hugo Weaving about loneliness, machines and how he should “walk away while you can”. A line that of course guarantees the protagonist will embark on a perilous journey. In cinemas 10 February Director: George Miller The great director George Miller is far from prolific, generally helming around two or three major productions a decade. Not much is known about his upcoming fantasy-drama, other than that it involves a British woman who discovers an ancient bottle in Istanbul with a genie inside it that offers her three wishes. The film (starring Idris Elba and Tilda Swinton) must therefore address the old “why not just wish for more wishes?” chestnut. Which we all know is a) a very good wish but b) prohibited by most genies. Director: Gracie Otto Sometimes, when your career’s on the skids and you’re determined to get your life back on track, the only thing to do is become a Dolly Parton impersonator. Right?! This is the premise of Gracie Otto’s musical dramedy, executive produced by and co-starring Rose Byrne, about a realtor, Red (Krew Boylan), navigating the aforementioned new career with (quoting the official synopsis) “bouncing silicon breasts” and “an intense relationship with a Kenny Rogers impersonator”. Director: Christina Stenseth The concept of slavery is often relegated to historical discussions, implying we live in a world where it is no longer a problem. Christina Stenseth begs to differ, and has made an observational documentary arguing modern slavery in fact takes place in this very county – on farms where travellers are exploited and underpaid through the Australian government’s working holiday maker program. Director: Rolf de Heer In the first one-and-a-half decades of the new millennium, veteran genre-hopping director Rolf de Heer (Bad Boy Bubby, Dance Me to My Song, Dingo) pumped out eight feature films and one TV documentary – but his output has been scarce in recent years. When I bumped into him recently at a hotel in Adelaide, De Heer assured me he was not retiring; not by a long shot. His next film is about a character named BlackWoman who is abandoned in a cage in the middle of the desert, continuing an array of highly respected films De Heer has made in close collaboration with Indigenous people – including Ten Canoes and Charlie’s Country, starring the late and great David Gulpilil. Director: Robert Connolly Director Robert Connolly’s latest literary adaptation (his others include The Dry and Barracuda) joins a growing number of films based on Tim Winton books. With a message about preserving the beauty of Australia’s oceans, the story follows a child named Abby (Ilsa Fogg) who becomes besties with a wild groper, thus continuing another trend of homegrown films about people becoming pals with animals and creatures. This is the cinema of Babe, Storm Boy, Red Dog, Oddball and Penguin Bloom. The cast includes Mia Wasikowska, Radha Mitchell and Eric Bana. Director: Anthony Hayes There’s gold in them thar Zac Efron! No wait: there’s Zac Efron in them thar Gold! In his outback drama, director Anthony Hayes plonks the American heartthrob in the unforgiving Australian desert, where Efron’s drifter character a) finds a very chunky nugget of the good stuff, but b) gets increasingly distraught and frazzled, continuing a line of films in which white people in the desert get burnt like pork chops (see also: Gary Bond in Wake in Fright, Mia Wasikowska in Tracks and David Wenham in The Furnace). In cinemas 13 January; and Stan on 25 January Director: Larissa Behrendt Larissa Behrendt has carved out a significant niche as a cine-essayist exploring subjects important to Indigenous Australian culture, including in Araatika: Rise Up! (about the creation of an Indigenous Australian haka) and After the Apology (about removal of First Nations kids from their families following Kevin Rudd’s apology to the stolen generations). In War & Order, Behrendt will explore half a century of First Nations activism in Australia and the ways it has been captured by artist Richard Bell. Director: Baz Luhrmann Elvis Monday⚡️Made a little something to let you good people know we are taking care of business on June 24, 2022.#Elvis #TCB pic.twitter.com/grf8IGqfw9 The latest display of Extreme Cinematic Excess – also known as “a Baz Luhrmann movie” – made last year’s list of films to look forward to, as did a few others delayed due to the funny old year (understatement of the century) that was 2021. But given Luhrmann movies have a way of soaking up all the attention, a double inclusion feels justified. A teensy-weensy bit of footage from his upcoming Elvis Presley biopic was tweeted by the man himself last month; expect, in the full film, tonnes more glitter. In cinemas 24 June Director: Leah Purcell Like The Nightingale, key themes of Leah Purcell’s feminist western – which reworks Henry Lawson’s short story The Drover’s Wife – include vengeance, gendered violence and class. The film expands on a play Purcell wrote and starred in and also adapted into a novel. Set in the New South Wales Snowy Mountains circa 1893, tough-as-nails protagonist Molly (Leah Purcell) runs a farm and raises four young children in the absence of her drover husband. The plot involves the arrival of an Aboriginal fugitive (Rob Collins) and a multiple murder case for a local police sergeant (Sam Reid, recently in The Newsreader).

1/3/2022,"Sorry? Bugger that. It’s “no” that always seems to be the hardest word. Every time I look at my diary for the upcoming week, there is at least one entry that triggers the thought: “Why did I say yes to that?”  It’s a common problem among my many people-pleasing friends. It’s like a pokies hit. Someone asks a favour, you say “yes”, you get a smile in return. Ka-ching! Good feelings. Until the dreaded thing looms in the calendar and the good feelings disappear like coins into a slot machine. As with all personal problems that have an easy answer (say “no”), I overthought the issue, catastrophised about the consequences of turning things down, and ultimately researched the shit out of it. I read productivity books (well, listened to the condensed versions on Blinkist, because who has the time?). I looked at the habits of effective people, thought fast and slow about life hacks, tried to learn the subtle art of not giving a fuck. I cogitated on all the hints, tips and tricks that people have written entire books about, and came up with two things that have been helping me ever since. No 1: Write a not-to-do list. The not-to-do list is potentially endless, but for the purposes of saying “no”, should be kept to things you are asked to do by those who would suck your very soul from your body. Mine includes things like “give speeches”, “drive long distances to catch up with people whose conversation is only bearable with copious amounts of wine”, and “work for free”. It helps crystallise in my mind the things I am allowed to say no to. Sorry, I don’t do speeches. I don’t do long drives (I usually leave off the bit about the conversations). I don’t work for free. It’s still not easy, but having the list at least gives me pause before “sure, I’d love to” trips off my traitorous tongue. No 2: Ask “would I want to do that tonight?” This is handy for all the other requests that have not yet made it on to the not-to-do list. It’s about being nicer to Future Tory. See, I suffer from peoplepleasia to an extent, but my larger problem is an entirely misplaced optimism about the capacity of Future Tory. Today Tory, when asked to commit to something in the hazy future, firmly believes that Future Tory will have her life in order by that point. Future Tory will have boundless energy and limitless time to spend on things other people want her to do. Future Tory, when she sees what Today Tory has committed her to, generally thinks Today Tory is a bitch. So now, when someone asks if I’d like to pop along to their crochet circle in a month and give a talk about defamation law, I think of Future Tory, and I ask myself if I’d say “yes” if the crochet circle was tonight. The answer is, almost invariably, “no”. ",Lifestyle/Life and style,Easy wins: give speeches? No way.

1/3/2022,"Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition where your immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in and around your joints, causing ongoing inflammation and pain. Some people have arthritis in the small joints of their hands and feet. In others, the inflammation involves major joints, such as the shoulders and the hips. Sometimes just getting out of bed and making it through the day with rheumatoid arthritis may feel like all you can manage. “But humans are designed to move,” says Dr Daniel Lewis, a rheumatologist and chronic pain specialist.  He says every system of the body – from the endocrine system to the nervous system, the musculoskeletal system, the sleep-wake cycle and mental health – is influenced by how physically active we are. “When you stop moving, systems start to collapse,” he says. “Movement encourages the natural healing function of the body – if you rest, you rust.” Errol Lim, a physiotherapist and the managing director of BJC Health, says that in the early stages of the disease, exercise can help prevent worsening of the joints. In more advanced stages, exercise can help reduce stiffness and pain. It can also improve mood and self-confidence. “There is no form of arthritis that won’t benefit from exercise, and a form of exercise can be found for every individual, irrespective of the pattern of their arthritis,” Lewis says. “Age is no barrier.” Activities like strength training and low-impact workouts can help relieve the pain. Here is a simple guide that can help you get moving, but it is always best to seek advice from a physiotherapist before you begin an exercise program. Hydrotherapy can be beneficial in treating rheumatoid arthritis, particularly when the pain makes exercising a challenge. It involves a series of exercises that generally focus on slow, controlled movements done in a warm-water pool. The water temperature is usually 34ºC, warmer than a typical swimming pool. The water supports your weight, and the warmth allows your muscles to relax and eases the pain in your joints, helping you exercise. The water also provides some resistance to moving your joints. By pushing your arms and legs against the water, you can improve your muscle strength. Everyone could benefit from the deadlift exercise, Lim suggests. “That’s a really functional position for all of us,” he says. “That’s how we lift children, how we lift our luggage, the box from the boot of our car, the six bottles of wine that we carry back from the supermarket.” Stand upright with your feet shoulder-width apart and your hands just outside your legs. Travel your hands along your thighs as you bend your knees and hips, keeping the spine straight. Then slowly lift by straightening the legs, as if you are picking up something from the floor. Lim recommends beginning with this simple movement and then progressing by increasing the number of repetitions or adding lightweights. “It’s a very slow progression.” The deadlift forces you to grip, recruiting the wrist, forearm and shoulder muscles. “A significant percentage of people with rheumatoid arthritis have issues with their upper back and neck,” Lim says. “This particular exercise can help with that.” Dancing can be a fun activity to keep the body moving. Dancing can help improve blood circulation and lubricate your joints, improving flexibility. It also releases serotonin and endorphin in your brain, which lift your mood and help prevent the mental health issues often associated with a chronic disease. A morning playlist can help you move through gentle dance moves to relieve the morning stiffness most people with rheumatoid arthritis experience. Dancing does not need to be vigorous. Small, rhythmic movements that follow your favourite tune can still offer the joy of dance without putting too much pressure on the joints. Lim says he was surprised to find that dancing is very popular among his patients. “It’s the music, and people love moving with it.” Lewis says people with rheumatoid arthritis should avoid exercises that aggravate pain or make it last into the next day. “It’s about finding the movement that allows people to function and keep their body moving, but not flare up.” “We spend a lot of time teaching our patients how to do appropriate pacing,” says Lim, “and staging the amount of activity they do throughout the week. We teach them how to listen to their body so that they know they’re not over-pushing it.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,How to move: with rheumatoid arthritis,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/03/how-to-move-with-rheumatoid-arthritis
1/3/2022,"April fool’s day 2015 was just another routine day for us. Late that afternoon, I parked the car above Dripstone Cliffs and headed towards Casuarina Beach. Even though you can’t swim in the Northern Territory’s coastal seas, because of crocodiles and stingers, I loved the beaches, and would run with my Tenterfield terrier, Finn, most evenings.  Before letting Finn off his lead, I checked the water for crocs. You can’t be too complacent; dogs have previously been a croc’s dinner here. This was my main concern that evening. Not the approaching storm, or getting wet. Storms usually pass as quickly as they come. I remember the storm clouds rolling in, some thunder and lightning from behind us. It didn’t stand out as potentially life-threatening. The remainder was like playing in a rugby game, where you remember running on to the field, then waking up concussed, knowing nothing of the game’s final score. I worked as a general paediatrician at Royal Darwin hospital. I woke up there, surrounded by fellow doctors and repeatedly asked them, “Where am I? What happened? Did lightning strike me?” During my night in ICU, I dreamed of being on the beach with Finn, feeling exposed, vulnerable and a bright flash. I don’t recall any other specifics. Thankfully, Finn was safe. He was off his lead and further down the beach. Over the following weeks, others relayed their recollections. Lots of people were on the beach that night. They saw the flash. Some even felt the ground shudder. They saw me fall and try to get up before collapsing. A medical doctor was running directly behind me. Her quick attendance saved my life. I was resuscitated on the beach before being taken to emergency by ambulance. Besides my physical signs of a burnt lip and mouth abrasions, they’d picked up a heart arrhythmia and immediately performed CPR. A week later, I broke out in a wide-spread rash – a delayed reaction to the strike. It looked terrible and was extremely uncomfortable. The doctors and I struggled to find an exact cause. It was either a post-lightning phenomenon, where the lightning strike rattles the bacteria on your skin and you become more susceptible to irritation, or a delayed reaction and an overwhelming stress response to the strike. While it took a few days to settle down, I haven’t had any issues since. Although I only spent a night in ICU, a series of cognitive tests were undertaken with a neuropsychologist, monitoring my heart and brain to ensure there were no lingering effects. I resumed work six weeks later after the tests returned satisfactory results. In 2020, I moved to John Hunter Children’s hospital in Newcastle. I grew up in South Africa, and after uni, I applied for jobs in Australia principally because I wanted to enjoy its renowned beaches and surf. Today, Amalia, my three-year-old daughter, and beach activities occupy every spare minute of my time outside work. While I know I’m extremely lucky to be alive; I’m still living the Aussie dream. I don’t have any fear or anxiety about storms, because I don’t remember being struck. They also say lightning never strikes twice. I haven’t stopped running on beaches, or in storms. It hasn’t changed my lifestyle, but it has made me assess my life and what’s important. I don’t take anything for granted these days.",Lifestyle/Life and style,A day at the beach: ‘Lots of people saw the flash.

1/3/2022,"As Covid-19 case numbers have continued to rise following the arrival of the Omicron variant alongside the easing of restrictions in Australia, the focus has begun to turn to the positivity testing rate. In New South Wales, where the rise in cases has been steepest, the infection rate as a proportion of the population is now one of the highest in the world. By New Year’s Eve the rate of infection was about 2.59 per 1,000 people, higher than the United States.  As cases have risen, so too has the positivity rate, which by Sunday had reached 20% in NSW. Other states have also experienced a steady increase in the ratio of positive cases. In Tasmania it reached 26% on Sunday, Victoria’s was 14.8% and Queensland’s 10.5%. So what is the positivity rate? And what does it tell us about the spread of the virus as evidence of Omicron’s milder severity continues to mount and governments try to shift the focus away from case numbers? The positivity rate of infection is the number of positive cases of Covid as a proportion of the number of PCR tests carried out. For example, a positivity rate of 20% in NSW means one in five people whose tests were processed in the reporting period had the virus. The figure doesn’t tell us how many cases are circulating in the community, but it can help to understand how many of the likely cases are being picked up. That, according to Alexandra Martiniuk, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Sydney, was particularly true at the beginning of the pandemic. “In general, the lower the positivity level, the more likely we think we’re catching, if not all, then most of the cases in the community,” she said. “As it rises you think we’re likely missing cases, and the more it goes up we’re likely to be missing more and more.” Martiniuk says that throughout the Covid pandemic, the reliability of the positivity rate has been affected by testing levels, and the policies dictating who gets tested and who doesn’t. She uses the example of Malawi, where she previously worked as a representative for the World Health Organization. Throughout the pandemic that country did very little population testing, limiting it to people who presented at emergency departments. In Australia, policy changes may be affecting the positivity rate. Recent changes to Covid-19 testing policies have seen governments ask people not to get tested unless they are symptomatic or fit a new and narrower definition of a close contact. As test numbers begin to fall, as they did on Sunday, it’s likely that the positivity rate will increase. “It’s like we had this bigger bag which contained all the people we have now, but also a lot of other people. People who might have been a casual contact, or who fit the old definition of a close contact, or who might have had very mild symptoms,” she said. “So now our bag is smaller so that we just have those symptomatic people and the very close contacts. So we may be missing those other people.” The positivity rate can also be affected by other things, such as the Christmas and new year holiday period. While the NSW positivity rate was 20% on Sunday, the seven-day average was about 10%. Certainly for scientists trying to understand how the virus is spreading, it is a figure worth watching. As Martiniuk puts it, for people seeking to respond to the pandemic, data “is like the flight path”. “Without it you’re flying blind.” And while changes to testing may affect the number of cases being caught, she said it was also important to recognise the need to focus resources. “I’m not so silly as to think we’re not in the situation that we’re in,” she said. “I think epidemiologists recognise times are changing and they need to and it’s both good and bad at the same time. We are having a resource issue and there’s no way we could PCR test everyone with Omicron. “PCRs need to get turned around faster because a lot of the treatments are needed in the first five days, so particularly vulnerable people need to know their status.” So as the focus of the pandemic shifts so that case numbers are no longer the focus of government, is it still relevant? As the positivity rate in Australia has climbed, some have pointed to the World Health Organization’s declaration that a positivity rate of 5% and under is evidence of spread that is under control. But that declaration was made towards the beginning of the pandemic in May 2020. A that point, governments were still seeking to control the virus, while Australia was trying to suppress it, or in some states, eradicate it. “Test positivity still has value, as in the metric is still valuable, but the benchmark of 5%, I’m not sure,” Martiniuk said. “I think obviously if a country is at 5% that’s great, it is a good indicator that their local pandemic is under control, but whether it’s achievable for most countries to aim for that at this point is another question.” However that doesn’t mean people should believe the pandemic is over. “We still need to test and we still need to go back to that 2020 thinking of bending the curve so if someone is really sick they can get the care the need. I think that message has been lost a little bit. “We still need testing to stop those chains of transmission even though it does feel overwhelming.”",News/World news,Australia’s Covid positive test rate: why is it rising and what does it really mean?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/australias-covid-positive-test-rate-why-is-it-rising-and-what-does-it-really-mean
