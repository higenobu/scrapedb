4/6/2022,"For the very first time, scientists have recorded the brain waves of a dying person. The recordings indicate that there could be some truth to the statement “my life flashed before my eyes” when someone has a near-death experience. The findings, which have been published in Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience, are not comprehensive because the patient had also suffered brain injuries. For the first time ever, we’ve caught a glimpse of what human brain waves look like in a dying person. After a fall, an 87-year-old male went to the emergency room and rapidly deteriorated while hooked up to an electroencephalograph (EEG) machine that captured his brain waves as he passed from a heart attack. This is not the first time we’ve seen the brain activity in a dying person—some patients who have been pulled off of life support have had simplified EEG recordings taken, though they’ve been limited to frontal cortex signals. This, however, is the first case of detailed recordings that may be able to shed some light on what we experience when we die. “For decades now, people have reported episodes of paradoxical lucidity and heightened consciousness in relation to death. This is intriguing as this seems to be occurring in brain areas that are shutting down in relation to death,” says Dr. Sam Parnia, director of critical care and resuscitation research at NYU Langone. “Although, in the past, it had been assumed that these may simply be anecdotes, population surveys have indicated that this phenomenon occurs in around 10 percent of the population [suggesting] that around 800 million people are living with this,” Parnia tells Popular Mechanics. The team working with the patient was able to capture about 900 seconds of brain activity and focused most of its analysis on the first 30 seconds before and after the patient’s heart stopped beating. Immediately following cardiac arrest, they noticed changes in the brain waves involved in higher-order cognitive functions, including information processing, concentrating, memory retrieval, conscious perception, and the different stages of dreaming, possibly indicating the brain was actively engaging in memory recall. “What is most intriguing is that this seems to be occurring when the brain is shutting down at the end of life. This study supports these descriptions and certainly raises the possibility that a marker of lucidity at the end of life may have been discovered,” says Parnia. Still, the team who worked with the patient can’t be certain that his life was flashing before his eyes because his health was already in decline at the time of death—he had suffered brain injuries that included bleeding, swelling, and seizures. Additionally, he had been taking anti-seizure drugs which further complicate what the data looked like as well as the interpretation of that data. Further, the team didn’t have healthy scans of the patient’s brain to compare against the more recent scans in which the patient was already in decline. In their paper, the team who worked with this patient theorized that because “cross-coupling” between the alpha and gamma waves indicates memory recall in healthy patients, this particular patient could have been experiencing a “recall of life,” or what is often referred to as someone’s life flashing before their eyes. Alpha brain waves are produced when we’re alert but calm and help us with activities like learning and coordination. Gamma waves are the fastest and are associated with high-level alertness, cognition, memory, and focus. According to Parnia, while the brain is in the process of shutting down and dying, “there is disinhibition of parts of the brain (i.e. emergence of functions) that are ordinarily depressed by our usual brain activity,” such as those we use to get through our day-to-day tasks. Because of this, we’re granted access to what Parnia refers to as “aspects of reality at death that we would ordinarily not have access to,” including the depths of our consciousness. To learn more about what happens within our brains during death is essentially impossible, though, because scientists would need to observe the neural activity of healthy subjects. “We do not anticipate death in healthy subjects and therefore could not obtain recordings in the near-death phase in anything other than from circumstances involving pathological conditions in acute care hospital settings,” the paper’s authors note. That the team was able to capture the 87-year-old patient’s brain waves as he died occurred entirely by happenstance, after all.

4/6/2022,"Hacker collective Anonymous announced on Twitter that it successfully breached and leaked the personal data of 120,000 Russian soldiers. ""All soldiers participating in the invasion of Ukraine should be subjected to a war crime tribunal,"" Anonymous said in the message. The leak included personal information like dates of birth, addresses, passport numbers, and unit affiliation. Anonymous also tweeted that it would take a while for society to forgive Russia for the atrocities in Ukraine spurred by Putin's invasion. While Anonymous announced the leak on Sunday, it occurred in early March and first appeared on Pravda, a Ukrainian news outlet, days after the invasion began. The outlet did not disclose the source of the leak but stated the ""Center for Defense Strategies acquired this data from reliable sources,"" according to Newsweek. This week, the Russian military has been facing even more scrutiny after concern was raised over alleged human rights abuses in Bucha. Reports suggested civilians were being abused and killed, and some say corpses have been found in yards, streets, and cars. Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Anonymous has been very outspoken about the war. ""The hacking will continue until Russia stops their aggression,"" Anonymous said. Among its efforts to fight back, the collective has claimed it has disabled government, corporate, and news websites, hacked into a top censorship agency, and hacked into Russian TVs. Other recent efforts include hacking into unsecured printers in Russia to spread anti-Kremlin propaganda. In an interview with IBT, one of the collective members said they were instructing Russians on how to install open-source software to allow citizens to bypass the country's censorship, according to Raw Story.

4/6/2022,"Christy Giles' husband is sharing more insight into the model's final hours before her tragic and shocking death.

In an exclusive interview with E! News, Jan Cilliers recalled the final conversations he had with his wife before she died from multiple drug intoxication due to what the medical examiner's office has ruled a homicide.

""The last time I spoke to her was the night that she went out,"" Cilliers told E! News. ""We've been texting the night she went out. I was up on the way to San Francisco and she was out on the beach watching the sunset saying she wished that she could watch the sunset with me.""

""Then, she texted me later that night as well,"" Cilliers continued. ""I was already asleep and then when I woke up, I tried to make contact with her multiple times. I couldn't get through to her, but we share each other's location. I didn't recognize the address that she was at. She wasn't responding to my messages. Then, the next time I looked, her location had moved to the Culver City Emergency Room."" Celebrity Deaths: 2022's Fallen Stars On Nov. 13, Giles, 24, and her friend Hilda Marcela Cabrales-Arzola, 26, were each left unresponsive outside two different hospitals in the Los Angeles area after a night out. While Giles was pronounced dead the night she was left unconscious outside of the Southern California hospital, Cabrales-Arzola was found unconscious and in critical condition almost two miles away from her friend at the Kaiser Permanente West Los Angeles Hospital. She died weeks later on Nov. 24. Both tested positive for multiple drugs in their system, according to the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner's Office. Giles died with a mixture of cocaine, fentanyl, ketamine and gamma hydroxybutyrate acid—commonly referred to as GHB or the date rape drug—found in her system, according to her online records reviewed by E! News. As for Cabrales-Arzola, the interior designer died from multiple organ failure and multiple drug intoxication. In December, three men—David Pearce, 38, Brandt Osborn, 42, and Michael Ansbach, 47—were arrested in connection with the deaths. Pearce was charged with manslaughter and the other two were accused of being accessories to manslaughter. Osborn and Ansbach were released from police custody the same month while Pearce remains in custody on $3.4 million bail from sexual assault charges unrelated to Giles and Cabrales-Arzola's cases. While police continue to investigate and accept tips from the public, Cilliers is hoping to keep his wife's memory alive by speaking out and sharing parts of their love story. After first meeting at an art gallery in West Hollywood, the couple had their first date on Valentine's Day in 2019. They were married in August of that year. ""I thought she was attractive,"" Cilliers said when recalling his first encounter with Giles. ""When I got to speaking with her, I thought she was also very interesting. And then we also ran into each other a few more times within the next couple of weeks and then I asked her out on a date. The rest was history."" According to Cilliers, his wife was planning to re-enroll in school and study psychology in hopes of helping others. ""She lived her life to the fullest,"" he said. ""She was very kind to everybody around her. She also didn't take any nonsense. She cared very much for the environment. She did multiple beach cleanup events outside our place. And she had a great group of friends that loved her and admired her. She brought a lot of joy to a lot of people's lives.""

Goonew, 24, was shot in a parking lot in Prince George’s County, Maryland on March 18th, and died several hours later at an area hospital. His family believes he was the victim of an armed robbery, and the Prince George’s County Police Department is offering a $25,000 for any information leading to the assailant’s arrest. On Sunday, Goonew’s family and friends held a celebratory event at Washington, D.C.’s Bliss Nightclub, which was billed as the rapper’s “final show.” As Complex points out, Goonew’s apparent embalmed corpse was propped upright and on full display during the event, adorned with a crown and designer clothing. A rapper named Black Fortune, who attended the event, confirmed that it was Goonew’s actual body and “no wax figure.” He added, “As long as his mother was happy that’s all that matter.” In a statement issued on Monday, Bliss Nightclub said it was “never made aware” that Goonew’s corpse would be on display during the event. “Bliss was contacted by a local funeral home to rent out our venue for Goonew’s home-going celebration,” the statement notes. “We sincerely apologize to all those who may be upset or offended. Please keep Goonew’s family and friends in your prayers at this difficult time. Respectfully, Bliss DC.” Embalmed Body of Dead Rapper Propped Up at D.C. Nightclub
