1/29/2022,"Afriend of mine met his wife on Twitter a few years ago. Because he was away travelling at the time, they didn’t go on a real-life date until two months into their courtship. Initially, his wife found his online persona a bit blunt. It wasn’t until they switched from text to voice messages their connection really flourished. My friend says he’s had similar feedback in the past – somehow his kind and curious nature is flattened into something harsher in text form. “So much more is communicated when you use your voice,” he says.  Ever since the invention of writing, the pendulum of mainstream human communication has swung between the written and spoken word, as different inventions favoured one form or the other: letters, books, telephones, radio, TV, SMS and instant messaging (used by 2 billion people each month on WhatsApp alone). And while we may feel these forms are interchangeable, as the American historian Walter Ong writes: “Technologies are not mere exterior aids but also interior transformations of consciousness, and never more than when they affect the word.” The forms we use to communicate affect what we say, how we say it and the way our message is received. “The medium is the message,” media theorist Marshall McLuhan says. The line between the spoken and the written is increasingly blurred by new communication tools. Text messaging is more like a verbal conversation than an email or a letter, while voice messages have elements of written forms in that the element of dialogue is interrupted. “Writing initiated … the separation of the spoken word from the living present,” says Ong. Lisa Fritsch, a German journalist and expert on how voice messages are used in messaging apps, says communication mediums sit on a continuum depending on how much they feature real-time dialogue, and how formal or informal the language is. Face-to-face conversation is the most informal and synchronous while academic writing is the opposite – and voice messages are somewhere between phone calls and texting. Fritsch studied the use of voice messages among international students, who told her they preferred them because their speed made them more practical, they allowed for more complexity and they were emotionally richer and more intimate. “I think with people you know well, like your parents or your best friends, you really like to have oral communication,” Fritsch says. “For example, it’s so much easier to make jokes through voice messages, and you can live a little bit with a friend you miss, or if you’re really sad, then you really hear that in the voice.” As communication has moved increasingly online in recent decades, it might seem that writing has become the primary way we communicate, but it’s worth keeping in mind, as Ong points out, “oral expression can exist and mostly has existed without any writing at all, writing never without orality”. Sign language is also dependent on oral speech systems, according to Ong. “Language is so overwhelmingly oral that of all the many thousands of languages spoken in human history … most have never been written at all.” Verbal communication is so natural to us it makes sense the pendulum might swing back in its favour with its integration into instant messaging – an “oral communication revival”, as Fritsch puts it. Voice memos were first introduced into messaging apps by WhatsApp in 2013. Use of the feature has slowly risen in the years since, but the pandemic – along with fresh uses on dating apps – seems to have accelerated its uptake. You can see the appeal: you get the intimacy and sensory richness of a phone call, but you can choose when to listen, and when to respond. It’s the on-demand culture of music and movies, migrated to phone calls. My friend describes phone calls as “an act of violence”. He’s a decade younger and I have to remind myself to message in advance to schedule a phone chat. “People who call without notice assume their need to talk to me trumps my need to continue what I’m doing without interruption,” he says. He will send voice notes to explain thought bubbles, rather than typing out an essay in a text message. “It’s so much less intimidating to spend a few minutes listening to a voice memo than reading 500 words of text.” Yet I find myself texting back or scheduling a phone call in response – eager for the immediate back-and-forth of a synchronous conversation. I don’t find my friend’s texts blunt (now that I know him), but if he has shared an interesting idea then I want to explore it in real time. Here’s a good example. When I started researching this column, I sent my friend a voice message explaining the theme and asking him why he likes voice messages so much. Only he never replied. When I finally cornered him into a phone call, I got not only the delightful backstory to his marriage, but a fascinating conversation about why we each prefer our different mediums. For some reason, voice messages give me a kind of stage fright, as though I’m making a speech to a roomful of people rather than talking to a friend – but they’re fun to play around with. We can get stuck into habitual ways of connecting with others, forgetting there are other options at our fingertips. As the tyranny of the pandemic keeps our worlds small, why not change up these habits and see what happens? Like this guy … This article includes content provided by TikTok.

1/29/2022,"Internal reports raise significant concerns about how young people from Aboriginal and African backgrounds are being cared for by the Victorian justice department as it struggles to deal with increasingly complex youth offenders. The reports show police are failing to refer youths to a support program designed to prevent them from offending, while service providers are keeping information on youth offenders in insecure online databases and some youth justice stakeholders fail to appreciate the concerns Aboriginal families have about the justice system.  The overwhelming picture that emerges is of a system straining under the weight of children who are committing more crime and more serious offences. The justice department released more than 1,200 pages of documents late last year in response to a question on notice which arose during a state parliamentary inquiry. The evaluations of justice department programs were completed as recently as last November, and most had not previously been released. One report showed the percentage of African-born offenders in youth detention increased threefold between 2013-14 and 2018-19 to about 16% of all detainees. A similar percentage were Aboriginal, according to the same report, meaning almost one in three youths in detention were either of African or Aboriginal backgrounds. The overall number of youths being detained fell over the same period. Many of those who remained had extensive criminal histories. The 61 participants in one program, for example, had committed a total of 9,893 offences between them, at an average of 162 crimes each (though the evaluation noted their offending decreased while involved in the program, and after completing it). The reports do not specify why young people from certain backgrounds could be overrepresented in the youth justice system. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But a series of department shortcomings are referred to, including the unpredictability of government funding, and the limited access to specialised support services for certain groups, including those who commit family violence, those battling mental health issues, and alcohol or substance abuse. The reports also give a sense that some programs are not functioning as well as possible because of failures by police and other agencies, and in some instances because of strained relationships between some of those agencies, such as child protection and youth justice workers. A program known as the Youth Support Service, which is designed to intervene early in the lives of children aged 10 to 17 who have come in contact with police before entering child protection or youth justice, was evaluated in 2019. The report found police officers considered completing electronic referrals to the program too onerous, despite the process only taking about five minutes. Police are responsible for the majority of referrals to the program, and the report found similar issues had been raised when the program was evaluated in 2017, but had seemingly not been addressed. The report also found referral processes were “variable” across regions. A person who works with young people and the justice department, who spoke to Guardian Australia on the condition of anonymity, said the failure of police to complete the referrals demonstrated a common theme in the state: police officers were given responsibilities for youth offenders they did not meet, leading to worse outcomes for children. “Police shouldn’t be asked to perform the job of the social worker,” she said, “because they’re not trained.” The reports also make clear the justice department was told within months of the Andrews government passing strict new bail laws in 2017 that they would probably be detrimental to Aboriginal people – a cohort the department was at the same time spending significant time and resources on trying to keep from prison. “The effects of this latest amendment will need to be investigated to determine whether it will have a disproportionate impact on Aboriginal Victorians,” a 2018 review of the Aboriginal Justice Agreement (AJA) found. “On the basis of earlier amendments, it seems likely that such impacts will be felt.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app The same report notes that the relationship between the department and Aboriginal people should be improved, with one government committee member describing the AJA as a “colonial document” that reinforced the idea that “white fellas have the money and black fellas have to ask for it”. In another report, which evaluated a therapy program and noted low referrals of Aboriginal youth, the department found: “There was also the perception by YJ [youth justice] stakeholders that Aboriginal families were suspicious of evidence-based programs generally.” The youth justice sector worker who spoke to Guardian Australia said the statement reflected a common misunderstanding within the department: that Aboriginal people declining to participate reflects an unwillingness to get support. “Aboriginal people are justifiably suspicious of trusting the government with their children,” she said. “That obviously leads to missed opportunities to have positive outcomes, even before children come in contact with the youth justice system.” Nerita Waight, the CEO of the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service, said bail laws must be urgently overhauled by the Andrews government, and called for a review into the culture of the justice department. “The Department of Justice has a serious problem with systemic racism and there needs to be an independent review into its culture and decision making to ensure decisions, policies, reform initiatives and legislation emanating from it don’t cause harm to Aboriginal Victorians”. Fiona Patten is chair of the parliamentary inquiry into Victoria’s criminal justice system, the inquiry which compelled the release of the reports in response to a question on notice. The Reason party MP said the reports spoke for themselves by detailing that the justice system was not working, and was particularly failing society’s most vulnerable. Patten said it was up to the Andrews government to determine whether it could divert some of the hundreds of millions of dollars it is using to build new prisons into programs which the reports showed, in some cases, were working. “I’ve never been in government, but I can only imagine that announcing that you’re spending millions of dollars on building new prisons is deemed more popular than spending a fraction of that on keeping people out of prison.” In a statement, the Department of Justice said the youth justice strategic plan for 2020-30 focused on preventing culturally and linguistically diverse young people from entering the system by supporting their diversion, education, housing, health and family, and to address the underlying drivers of their offending. The department declined to answer detailed questions about the contents of the reports. “The Victorian government works to provide the best possible rehabilitation outcomes for young people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, based on what we know works to address offending and drive young people away from the justice system,” a spokesperson said.",News/Australia news,‘Colonial document’: Victorian justice department reports raise concerns about welfare of Indigenous young people,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/29/colonial-document-victorian-justice-department-reports-raise-concerns-about-welfare-of-indigenous-young-people
1/29/2022,"Requiring three doses for full Covid vaccination would “send a clear signal that it is essential, rather than simply a matter of choice and personal responsibility”, a member of a World Health Organization advisory group said. Though the national cabinet is still awaiting advice from Australia’s independent expert group on vaccination, Atagi, as to whether people should only be considered fully vaccinated against Covid after three doses, the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, had been pre-empting Atagi’s advice.  “International evidence, our own experience, the views of experts and hopefully the confirmation of both Atagi and national cabinet later today will mean that everyone knows and understands that this is a three-dose project,” he said on Thursday.  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Given Atagi is yet to release its advice, the matter was not settled at a meeting of the national cabinet later that day. But on Friday the New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, backed Andrews, saying he thought the proposal “makes sense”, and that even without a decision by the national cabinet three doses should be required to be “up to date” with vaccination. “We’re waiting on advice federally in respect of whether or not it would be deemed that three doses would equal a determination of being fully vaccinated,” he said. “In the interim, I mean, we can’t say it enough: get boosted. We would say that in order to be up to date with your vaccination. You need to have three doses.” South Australian premier Steven Marshall also said this week it was “increasingly likely” that people would need a third dose to be considered fully vaccinated. His government has already mandated the booster jab for workers including those in healthcare, aged care, and people with disabilities. On Friday afternoon, the Northern Territory announced boosters would be mandated for workers in public-facing roles, with an 11 March deadline for high-risk workers. Queensland University of Technology’s Prof Ross Gordon, who is part of the WHO’s technical advisory group on behavioural insights and sciences for health, said research had shown receiving a third dose significantly reduces the risk of catching, becoming seriously ill from and dying from the Omicron variant, compared with only two doses. “Due to Omicron showing some level of vaccine evasion, there has been a move around the world towards considering a minimum of three doses as being required,” he told Guardian Australia. “Given that Australia is in the middle of a large wave of Omicron infections – promoting third-dose vaccinations is important to protect public health and to mitigate the worst effects of this wave.” Booster uptake has been slow in Australia, with a Guardian Australia analysis showing it could take well into 2022 to hit an 80% booster vaccination rate, with the booster rollout currently ranking almost last out of 70 countries. But there are also challenges to mandating a third dose, such as considering timing and a deadline for when it should be required, ensuring access and what it will mean for international travellers coming from countries where boosters are not required. If a third dose is mandated, Gordon said, it will be crucial to make it easy to get done. Wide availability and easy access, a simple and effective booking system, and a good experience when getting vaccinated will be critical to any mandate, he said. “From a behavioural sciences perspective, behaviour change only comes about if people are motivated, if there are strong social norms and available social support, and if there is an enabling environment,” Gordon said. “This is where mandating third-dose vaccination comes in. If there is no mandate, there is a risk that some people will consider the third dose not really that important – and therefore decide not to get it. “We need to motivate people to get the third dose by reminding them that Omicron can still have serious public health implications not only for yourself but for others in our community – especially older people, people with underlying health conditions, which is a large share of our population.” Andrews said a reason for his calling for a mandate was that “we would not have got to 93% double dose” without a mandate. However, Gordon said the WHO is concerned that rich countries are pushing ahead with boosters without addressing vaccine inequity around the world. Fewer than 10% of Africans are fully vaccinated. “So, while rolling out third-dose vaccinations in Australia is important, we need to do more at a global level to vaccinate the world, save more lives and also reduce the opportunity for the virus to further mutate.” Dr Stuart Turville, an associate professor in the immunovirology and pathogenesis program at the University of NSW’s Kirby Institute, said any change to vaccination requirements must be led by health and science experts, and not by political parties. The experts that formed Atagi “are brought on panels for a reason”, he said. “It is the collective knowledge that brings this to the table. We need to learn from what we did during the HIV response. We need a bipartisan political approach, to listen to the experts and the most important thing to do is engage the community along the way.” Professor Dominic Dwyer, the director of public health pathology in NSW who was among international experts who travelled to Wuhan last year for the WHO investigation into the origins of coronavirus, said while booster shots were important, he was “not sure there is clear evidence to say a booster should be included as part of the ‘fully vaxxed’ definition” for everyone. “It’s important for all to have a booster, but it is a political decision as to whether it should be mandated,” he said.",News/Australia news,"Requiring booster shots in Australia would send message it’s ‘essential’, WHO adviser says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/29/requiring-booster-shots-in-australia-would-send-message-its-essential-who-adviser-says
1/29/2022,"Students will return to school in several states and territories from next week. The New South Wales and Victorian governments will provide staff and students with rapid antigen tests for twice-weekly surveillance testing for the first four weeks of term.  With a total of 24m self-test kits to be delivered across the two states in the coming weeks, experts share tips on how to make at-home nasal swabbing as painless as possible for daunted adults and kids. Dr Eric Levi, an ear, nose and throat surgeon in Melbourne, says it is important for parents and guardians to demystify the testing process, emphasising that it may be uncomfortable but not painful. “It shouldn’t hurt like a PCR test,” Levi says. “A lot of kids have had bad experiences in the past and the thought of having [a RAT] twice a week – or, in some special circumstances, daily – for the next few weeks or months is quite scary for them.” To reduce anxiety about rapid testing, Levi recommends that adults show their children a how-to video so they know what to expect, and also discuss what the child is most comfortable with. “Most kids do have a preference: they want to lie down on their bed … or they want to hug a pillow, or they can sit on their parent’s lap if they’re young kids,” he says. 2. Swab on kids.It does not have to be scary or painful. Let kids see this to reduce their worry.Gently rest head on pillow or arm.Swabbing hand needs to rest on lip, cheek or chin in case the child suddenly moves. https://t.co/VTcdxVPmfv To minimise first-day stress, Levi recommends doing a practice run a few days in advance. It may be helpful to practise with a cotton bud before using a precious RAT kit, he adds. Dr Karen Price, president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, says it’s important for adults to have a clear idea of how to perform a RAT “so that they’re not afraid and they don’t feel they’re going to hurt their children in any way”. Price recommends carefully reading the instructions specific to the particular brand of rapid test, or watching a manufacturer’s video if available. “The biggest, scariest part is that people aren’t sure how you stick something in your nose safely,” she says. In children, a swab should be inserted only 1 to 2cm into the nostril, compared to 2 to 3cm in adults. Both Levi and Price emphasise that due to the anatomy of the nasal cavity – which extends backwards and downwards – the direction the swab is inserted in is important. “It’s really important to not go up vertically but to go back horizontally,” Price says. The swab should be inserted gently along the bottom of the child’s nose, a technique Levi describes as “go low, go slow”. It can help to stabilise a squirming child by resting their head against a pillow or a parent’s arm. The swab then needs to be rotated several times, “long enough to gently pick up as much goo [as necessary], which is where the virus will be,” Price says. There are currently two TGA-approved brands of self-administered RATs that do not involve a nasal swab. One is a saliva test, which involves holding a device under the tongue for two minutes. The other, termed an “oral fluid test”, involves spitting into a tube. Both require that the person taking the test refrain from eating or drinking for a period of time beforehand, as accuracy may be affected. Unlike nasal swabs – which will be provided by state governments to students for free – these tests must be individually bought. “Doing it twice a week, if they’re going to cost about $20 per test, is going to be pretty expensive in the long run,” Levi says. “The vast majority of kids – as long as parents know how to do it slowly and comfortably – would be able to do well with a nasal swab.” Unlike PCR tests, nasal swabs should only be used up the nose and are not designed to work accurately as throat swabs. “If it’s not recommended for use in the throat, then it shouldn’t be used in the throat,” Price says. Levi adds: “A lot of people want to find an alternative [to nasal swabs] because people are afraid of the pain. But if you teach them how to do it well, then you demystify the whole experience and you’re probably going to be just fine.” Victoria Health guidance says kids under 12 should have a parent or guardian perform the test, while children 12 years and older who want to do the test themselves should be supervised to make sure they follow the steps correctly. There are certain fluids that can fake a positive RAT result, Levi says. Overseas, there have been reports of pupils spoofing tests by using orange juice or other liquids. It occurs due to a chemical reaction in the test, rather than the substance itself containing Covid. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Experts have said it’s possible to spot a faked positive test by washing it with the provided buffer solution to restore the test strip to the correct pH. “It’s really important for teenagers to understand they’re participating in a major community public health response,” Price says. “We really want accurate results as much as possible because they’ll protect other people and they’ll protect themselves. “Anything that interferes with the accuracy of that information is going to challenge the public health services and also the way that we respond in future.”",News/Australia news,‘It shouldn’t hurt’: demystifying rapid Covid testing for kids as Australian schools reopen,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/29/it-shouldnt-hurt-demystifying-rapid-covid-testing-for-kids-as-australian-schools-reopen
1/29/2022,"Aged care providers and unions have quietly struck a deal acknowledging the increased complexity and value of aged care work, a key step in a case seeking pay rises of up to 25%. Aged care stakeholders lodged a consensus statement shortly before Christmas as part of the union-run case arguing for pay rises of at least $5 an hour, although the in-principle agreement about work value does not endorse the size of the claim.  The deal raises the pressure on the Morrison government by noting that whatever pay increase the Fair Work Commission orders, it should be “fully funded by the federal government and linked to transparency and accountability measures as to how funding is used”. Despite the aged care royal commission recommending the industry should coordinate a consensus position that included the federal government, the deal notes the health department “was invited to attend [consultation] and participate but declined”. “The stakeholders agree that wages in the aged care sector need to be significantly increased because the work of aged care workers has been historically undervalued for a range of reasons and has not been properly assessed,” it said. Increased wages are needed to “to attract and retain the number of skilled workers needed to deliver safe and quality care” in an industry where minimum wages are less than the acute health sector for nurses and “significantly” less than for disability support workers. The stakeholders asked the commission to consider that Australians are living longer and that care needs are more complex, including more embedded palliative care, acute and sub-acute care, and provision of medicines. The deal was signed by provider bodies including Aged and Community Services Australia and Leading Age Services Australia, seniors groups and unions representing nurses, health and aged care workers. The federal government made technical submissions answering questions about the aged care workforce, but took no position on whether their work value justified a pay rise. Lloyd Williams, the national secretary of the Health Services Union, said it would be “pushing all parties” – both the Morrison government and Labor – to implement the royal commission recommendations and commit to the case to lift pay.  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “It’s a very significant statement, we’re very pleased to be able to reach consensus,” he said. “The Morrison government has completely ignored the process. “It’s an important principle to be able to tell the Australian people and workers in the aged care sector – we support them being paid better than $21 an hour. “Many different jobs pay a lot better than aged care – why would you choose aged care as a career … if you could earn more in retail, hospitality … or work at Bunnings for more than $21 an hour?” Lasa chief executive, Sean Rooney, said “it is disappointing that the government was not a party to this statement and has not made any commitment to fund the outcome of the Fair Work Commission case”, sentiments echoed by Paul Sadler, the chief executive of Aged and Community Services Australia. “While we’re very supportive of an increase in aged care workers’ pay rates, we’re hamstrung by the fact we don’t control our destiny in terms of capacity to pay,” he said, citing the fact the government both subsidises care and also regulates how much they can charge consumers,” Sadler said. Sadler said “at the very least” both parties should commit “to fund whatever [the] FWC decides”, although the case is likely to be heard mid-year and therefore decided after the election. Carolyn Smith, the aged care director of United Workers Union, said aged care is skilled work and it is good “providers are saying they want to be paying people more”. Smith said the federal government is “trying to fob off their responsibility for aged care funding” to the decision of the commission, which is “emblematic of their hands-off approach”. “The FWC will pay regard to whether the government will fund the increase – so the government’s lack of position on this potentially will impact the outcome.” In his budget reply last May, Anthony Albanese said that Labor would “support the Fair Work Commission moving quickly to meaningfully lift the wages of aged care workers”. Smith said this was “pretty unequivocal” that Labor would be “actively supporting” a pay rise in the sector, although no policy with a funding commitment has yet been announced. The shadow aged care minister, Clare O’Neil, said Labor “will fix the crisis in aged care and workforce issues, including wages, are key to that”. “Labor will announce our full aged care policy before the election.”",News/Australia news,Industry stakeholders strike deal that could lead to pay rise for Australian aged care workers,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/29/industry-stakeholders-strike-deal-that-could-lead-to-pay-rise-for-australian-aged-care-workers
1/29/2022,"Listening to the New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, speaking on Friday, you’d be forgiven for thinking Victoria was a new member of his cabinet. Perrottet said the NSW government had “worked alongside” Victoria to deliver thousands of rapid antigen tests before schools resume next week. They were “the only states in the country” that could boast as much, he said.  On the business support package likely to be announced in the coming days Perrottet again referenced Victoria – the NSW treasurer, Matt Kean, was working “very closely” with his southern counterparts “because we’re in a very, very similar situation,” he said. The bonhomie is apparently shared. On Thursday the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, said the two premiers “work together as close as we can”. For anyone who lived in NSW or Victoria through the first two years of the Covid-19 pandemic, this developing bromance between leaders from opposite ends of the ideological divide is a jarring shift. Despite cooperating in March 2020 to pressure the Morrison government on school closures, Andrews and the former NSW premier Gladys Berejilkian, spent much of the nation’s Delta outbreak trading barbs, as the politics of border closures, lockdowns and vaccine allocations became an ongoing pandemic theatre. But a much closer working relationship has formed between Andrews and Perrottet during the latest wave of the pandemic. “The dynamic has entirely changed,” a Victorian government source told the Guardian. “They have a completely different relationship. [They] text each other all the time and swap ideas. They genuinely like each other.” Blossoming friendship aside, there are practical benefits to the newfound closeness. In December, Perrottet gave a speech at the National Press Club in which he described his frustration after attending his first meeting of the former Council of Australian Governments as NSW treasurer. “When I left I turned to my chief of staff and said ‘well that was a complete waste of time’,” he said in the speech. It prompted him to launch, alongside Victorian treasurer, Tim Pallas, the board of state and territory treasurers, which he said “made the states a more potent force in shaping federal financial relations again”. “We realised that the federal government could take a ‘divide and conquer’ approach to these meetings – because we weren’t working together,” Perrottet said. “Rather than picking states off, the commonwealth government on many issues is now confronted with a strong unified voice.” Now premier, multiple sources told the Guardian that Perrottet was playing the same game at a higher level. “In one sense it’s an indication of two leaders genuinely doing what they think is right during a pandemic, and in those cases it doesn’t matter what political party you belong to,” one senior NSW minister said. “But I think it also goes back to the strong working relationship Dom had with Tim Pallas, and the fact he realised you can leverage the commonwealth and you can caucus against the commonwealth if you work together.” Former Labor campaign strategist turned pollster Kos Samaras, said the tactic could also have political upside. “The prime minister can’t say no to them when they’re working together and the voters will reward them for it because they hated the tribal politics in the earlier stage of the pandemic,” he said. “Didn’t matter whether it was Liberal or Labor doing it, voters on both sides of the Murray hated it.” Samaras noted Andrews is also able to blunt any political attacks by the state’s Coalition opposition by following Perrottet’s lead. The improved relations also come down to personalities. As premier, Berejiklian was famous for her rigid approach to politics, and many of her own colleagues in NSW grew frustrated with a perceived unwillingness to change tack on policies that weren’t working. Their offices are also said to enjoy a more consultative relationship. Communication between Andrews’ and Berejiklian’s senior staff became “virtually nonexistent” during 2021, a Victorian source said. Several sources said the relationship between Andrews and Perrottet formed around the time the Victoria-NSW border reopened in early November. Both have since reintroduced restrictions in response to the Omicron outbreak, brought forward access to booster vaccine doses by a month and released near-identical return to school plans on 23 January. They are also in agreement about redefining “fully vaccinated” to mean three doses of a Covid-19 vaccine, with Perrottet saying on Friday that a proposal taken to national cabinet by Andrews this week “makes sense”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Samaras said despite appearances the duo are pragmatists rather than ideologues, and having accepted they cannot stop Covid-19, they’re now working together to manage it. “Both premiers have clearly made a decision they’re going to help their constituencies live with this virus,” he said. “That’s not saying it’s going to be easy, it’s going to be hard, the health system will be continuously under stress, the supply chain issues are ongoing and we’ve got winter coming but it’s easier when you have a collective approach to these problems.” ",News/World news,‘They text each other all the time’: Perrottet and Andrews embrace the benefits of a united front,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/29/they-text-each-other-all-the-time-perrottet-and-andrews-embrace-the-benefits-of-a-united-front
1/29/2022,"On the night of 3 November last year, under the elaborate, cavernous ceiling of the State theatre in the centre of Sydney’s CBD, applause broke out for an unlikely opening night film at the Sydney film festival. The film the festival audience was applauding was Here Out West, an anthology film set in western Sydney, with each of the eight chapters penned by a young, emerging writer. The structure itself, however, was not the most unusual thing about it. More glaring was that the film – featuring nine different languages, a diverse cast, and written by people who live or grew up west of the city centre – refused to see itself as small: a glossy tale of drama, not disadvantage, in Australia’s multicultural suburbs.  It was also a substantial change of tone from the 2019 Sydney film festival, which opened with Palm Beach: a film set in the affluent Sydney beach suburb featuring ocean views, poolside yoga scenes and an all-white cast. The opening scenes of Here Out West feature not a scrap of blue ocean, no hint of red dust but motorways and fibro homes alongside new two-storey brick ones. One in 11 Australians live in the wide expanse considered western Sydney; on Twitter after the premiere, some of them praised the film for finally seeing their world. “If ever there was an example of manifesting something and it happening, that was it. It was just such an amazing moment for us,” says producer Sheila Jayadev. “It was a huge declaration to the Australian film industry that a story like ours is worthy of an opening night slot. “That was the film festival experience, but now, of course, we’re competing at the cinemas with big blockbusters, with overseas titles, and we’re all just holding our breath to see: will this translate?” Jayadev is speaking to Guardian Australia just before Here Out West’s theatrical release on 3 February. Since the festival opening night, Covid cases have skyrocketed nationally and cinemas – like restaurants and other indoor venues – have suffered. It is, says Jayadev, a challenging environment to be launching any film into the world, let alone one that is trying something different. “One of our writers, Arka Das, mentioned this: that there’s always so much pressure on films that are diverse to get it right, or to succeed, because the next one that comes along is sort of appraised in light of that. If the previous one failed, then it’s like, ‘Oh, it won’t work’. Not realising that we need volume to really make our mark, and to see that proper change, with audiences going to watch content that reflects their daily lives,” she says. “We still have a long way to go. There should be 20, 30 films like ours out there, and then let’s start figuring out whether or not audiences want to see [them].” Nearly a year before the premiere, Das and fellow writer Nisrine Amine sit under a portable gazebo on a sunny and blustery afternoon at Greenacre in Sydney’s west. It is the second last day of filming for Here Out West, and the nearby nature strips are wide and half-bleached by the sun. Both writers (Das also acts in the film) grew up in and around western Sydney. When they responded to the call-out from production company Co-Curious for young writers in the area to be part of a screen storytelling project, the intention was not to make a feature film. “I thought it was going to be a web series,” says Das. But after the three-day development workshop where the eight writers drafted their scripts, Jayadev and Co-Curious’s Annabel Davis and script producer Blake Ayshford realised it needed to be something more. “I’m really glad they decided to push it that way,” says Das. Amine, who is also an actor and runs a drama school in Parramatta, hopes the film will give her young students the sense that they, too, belong on screen. “I think that’s me trying to heal a really old hurt,” she says. But she and Das say there is a change in tide. “Going back 10 years ago … if you were from western Sydney, or not from the inner-city areas, it felt like you were really climbing a big mountain you would never get to the top of,” says Das. “Suddenly I feel like in the last five years the culture has shifted, especially in the music scene, and I hope that is going to happen in film and television.” Producer Davis says decades of advocacy have led to a point where there is “momentum, goodwill and money, importantly” for producing stories about, and by, traditionally underrepresented groups in Australia. “It’s not just the right thing to do; it’s the commercially sensible thing to do, because there’s an audience out there for stories like this … What we are seeing on screen does not match what our community in Australia looks like.” Das sees the equivalents of western Sydney in other metropolises around the world – including London, Paris and Toronto. “I don’t see why this film isn’t commercially accessible to people around the world,” says Das. Coordinating five directors, dealing with nine languages and stitching together a cohesive feature film “was all one great learning and process of discovery”, Jayadev says. “I think we underestimated just how complex it could be.” She is not rushing again into an anthology, but working closely and collaboratively with writers throughout the entire production process is a model she would employ again “in a heartbeat”, she says. “It’s a critical way of working if you’re going to be telling a story that is specific and culturally nuanced.” Each of the eight writers have producer credits too, having worked with the production team throughout to ensure all the small details – down to the kinds of family photographs that are on the wall – reflect the reality that they have drawn from. “We’ve seen the superficial ‘outside in’ story, and now we need to start seeing from the inside, telling the outside world,” Jayadev says. Australian stories are moving on from beach, and from patronising parodies of the working class, says Das. “That’s been the Australian identity in film and television, and that’s fine for its time. But now is the time to tell more nuanced stories.” Here Out West opens in Australian cinemas on 3 February",Arts/Film,‘Will it translate?’: how a risk-taking Australian film hopes to change the industry,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/29/will-it-translate-how-a-risk-taking-australian-film-hopes-to-change-the-industry
1/29/2022,"On a winter’s evening in January 2020 two women stood talking in the foyer of a cinema in Iceland’s capital, Reykjavík. One of them, dressed smartly for the occasion in a red blazer, was Eliza Reid, the wife of Iceland’s president. The other, listening intently, was Nara Walker, an Australian artist who’d cofounded the event that both women were there to celebrate – the Reykjavik Feminist film festival. At first glance, it wasn’t a remarkable scene. Unless you knew that Walker was still on probation for a serious assault conviction, having been released from a Reykjavík prison less than a year earlier. Or if you’d read the breathless coverage of her story in the tabloid media, where she’d been branded “the Australian tongue-biter” – the woman who bit off her husband’s tongue during a fight. In Iceland, and beyond, she was infamous.  “Even on the Sunshine Coast [in Queensland], where I went to high school, where I am supposed to feel the safety of home, the headline was in capital letters, ‘Why I bit my husband’s tongue off’,” Walker recalls. “I’ve never used that language to describe what happened to me, or what I did.” Since she was arrested by Reykjavík police on 1 November 2017, Walker has maintained that she acted in self-defence against the man who was then her husband. She has accused the Icelandic authorities of viewing the tongue-biting in a vacuum and failing to properly investigate her claims of domestic violence. Essentially, of dismissing her story from the start. For women who report abuse, she reflects, this is a common experience: “We say, ‘He says, she says’, but really, a lot of the time, it’s just ‘he says’.” Alone in a foreign country, Walker managed to push her case all the way to Iceland’s supreme court, where her final appeal was dismissed on 4 February 2019. When she entered Hólmsheiði maximum security prison soon after, on 20 February, she was surrounded by supporters from Iceland’s close-knit feminist community. Still, few could have imagined that within the year she would have founded a film festival. But even as Walker chatted casually with Iceland’s first lady on the opening night of the festival, she had already turned her mind to her next project – the long and difficult process of suing Iceland over its treatment of her at the European court of human rights (ECHR). The Australian is now one of nine women suing Iceland at the human rights court, accusing the country that has topped the World Economic Forum’s gender parity index for 12 years straight of failing to protect them from gendered violence. Each case will be decided separately, as the court doesn’t accept class actions, but the women are linked by common experience: they made allegations of rape, domestic violence or sexual harassment to authorities in Iceland, only to have the police or prosecutors drop their case. Walker’s application to the ECHR was made in two parts: the first, filed in mid-2019, regarded her treatment by Icelandic police and prosecutors; the second, from January 2020, concerned how her allegations of abuse against her former husband were handled. With both Walker and Iceland declining to settle, her case has entered what the ECHR calls the “contentious phase”. The court is currently awaiting Iceland’s response to the merits of Walker’s complaints under three articles of the European convention on human rights – the prohibitions of torture and discrimination, and the right to respect for private and family life. Iceland has until mid-February to come back to the ECHR with its position after which the court will make a ruling about whether the Australian’s human rights were violated under the convention. If she wins, the court will issue a binding judgement and may award damages. Having spent most of her 20s in Europe, travelling and exhibiting her painting and performance art across the continent and in Asia, Walker’s Australian accent has softened at the edges, its vowels rounded out. She speaks methodically, carefully, and yet, more than four years on, her retelling of her arrest in Iceland and what transpired in its wake, still has a sort of nightmarish quality. In the early hours of 1 November 2017, police arrived at a residence in Reykjavík to discover a chaotic scene. Inside they found three people: a woman sitting, sobbing, on the stairs that led to the upper floor of the apartment, as well as an Icelandic woman and a man with blood around his mouth. The man showed police the source of the bleeding – his tongue had been bitten off by the woman on the stairs, his wife Nara Walker. There were a few agreed facts: Walker and her husband, who’d married in 2016 when they were living in the United Kingdom, had spent the evening out with friends – the Icelandic woman and an American man – and the four had returned to the apartment to continue drinking. An argument had broken out and escalated to violence. The American man had left the apartment. At some point, Walker had bitten down on her husband’s tongue, severing the tip. Here, though, the stories diverged dramatically. The Icelandic woman named Walker as the aggressor. Walker was adamant that she was the victim. “When they were handcuffing me, I began repeating myself that I was the victim and that he had assaulted me,” Walker tells the Guardian. “I couldn’t understand why they were handcuffing me.” It took nearly a month for Walker to realise the police were only investigating her, and not her husband, over the incident. In her application to the ECHR, her lawyers argue this was due to the language barrier – Walker doesn’t speak Icelandic – and say their client didn’t receive sufficient information about the investigation. They add: “It was therefore not until 30 November 2017 that she could press charges.” Walker alleged that her former partner had been physically violent with her before the 1 November incident, both in the UK and Iceland. In her application to the ECHR, she claims the violence began to escalate after the pair married in 2016. How the Icelandic police handled these allegations is the focus of the second part of Walker’s application to the human rights court. The Australian’s lawyers argue that she was treated solely as an offender by Icelandic police and that there was not an effective criminal investigation conducted into her accusations against her then-husband. Her complaint also states that the Icelandic courts failed to consider her allegations of abuse in the “broader context” of the tongue-biting incident – they argue Walker bit down out of instinct when her husband pressed his tongue into her mouth. Walker’s lawyers had raised her allegations of domestic violence during her criminal trial in the Reykjavík district court, where she pleaded self-defence to the assault charges stemming from 1 November 2017. They laid out evidence to support her claims – including a corroborating statement from the American man and medical notes about her injuries, notably a fractured rib. There was also correspondence with her husband, which Walker said related to previous alleged abuses, including one incident in which she claimed he had put LSD in her tea without her knowledge. Walker’s husband has always denied he was violent with her on 1 November 2017. He has also denied her allegations of abuse in the UK and Iceland, claiming, with regard to one allegation, that Walker was attempting to avoid liability for the charges against herself. In regards to the LSD, he told police he warned Walker the tea contained drugs before she drank it. During her criminal trial, Walker was living in a women’s shelter in Reykjavík. She was essentially homeless, her passport seized by Icelandic authorities. Many of the women there, she came to realise, had fled their homes trying to break the cycle of domestic violence. She met a woman at the shelter, a domestic violence survivor. “She’s a real fighter herself in the sense of going through the system with her ex-partner,” Walker says. The pair discussed the Australian’s trial, and her intention to appeal if the court found against her. “And she said, ‘Yes, and then you appeal again, and then you go to the European court of human rights’,” Walker recalls. This was the moment the human rights court became, for her, a sort of north star. It was something to fix her mind on through the district court trial, where she was found guilty on 18 March 2018 of serious assault against her then-husband and minor assault against the Icelandic woman. The court accepted the evidence of her former husband and the other woman over Walker’s testimony. She was sentenced to 12 months, with nine suspended pending good behaviour, and fined substantially. While the court accepted Walker had been injured in the incident, it did not accept her claim of self-defence. According to Icelandic law, the act of defence must not be disproportionate to the original or threatened attack. When she appealed, her sentence was increased to 18 months and the fine raised. “At one point, I felt, after the appeal, just really distraught … because of how the verdict came in, but also how the police were treating me coming up to the appeal,” Walker says. She feared any mistake would undermine her entirely. “I had to remember photographically everything that happened that night. Everything.” And in the background, as her trial wound its way to Iceland’s highest court, the Icelandic police’s investigation into her allegations against her husband stretched on for almost 17 months. Prison was a lonely experience for Walker. Art tumbled out of her. “I painted, I think, 70 paintings. Little ones, watercolours,” she says. “And I drew a lot and I wrote a lot.” But for the most part she passed her days imagining she was anywhere else. “I would pretend to be a sunflower in the window. I would stand by the window and move with the sun, very slowly,” she recalls. “The prison guards would come in and be surprised, asking me, ‘Are you suntanning?’” On 23 April 2019, while Walker was still serving her sentence, the chief of the Reykjavík police wrote to her, telling her they were dropping the investigation into her allegations of violence against her ex-husband. In August that year, the director of public prosecutions upheld this decision, saying one of the alleged incidents didn’t occur within Iceland’s jurisdiction and there was insufficient evidence regarding others to continue investigating. For Walker, the other eight women suing Iceland at the ECHR and the coalition of 13 Icelandic women’s and equality organisations backing them this is the key issue at hand: the country lauded as the best place in the world to be a woman, they claim, isn’t properly investigating and prosecuting violence against women. There is a term, the Nordic Paradox, sometimes used to describe the discord between the region’s reputation for gender equality and its high rates of gendered violence. Guðrún Jónsdóttir, a social worker who helped found Stígamót, one of the organisations backing the women’s ECHR bids, says these figures are only the tip of the iceberg. Women in Iceland under-report, she says, and “between 70 and 85% of violent cases against women are dropped” by police or prosecutors before they even get to trial. “If we in this so-called paradise have to live through this … how is the situation in other countries?” Jónsdóttir asks. Walker hopes a win at the ECHR could have a significant impact in Iceland and across Europe, given the supranational nature of the court. Icelandic authorities told the Guardian it would not comment before presenting its position to the ECHR later this month. A thread runs through Walker’s art practice, a drive to transform her trauma into something expressive, something that makes sense to her. On probation after leaving prison in Iceland, she poured her idle time into creating the film festival, turning “a very dark moment in my life” into a community of support. Her case at the ECHR similarly presents the opportunity for a hopeful coda to a traumatic time. “It’s something so bad that could become something good,” she says. The case is one of the final things tying her to life in Europe. Late last year, she was finally able to secure a seat on an Australian government repatriation flight, though it was a bittersweet return. She was too late to say goodbye to her stepfather, who passed away in September 2021. Yet when she caught sight of the red-brown landscape of Australia as her flight came to land in Darwin, she knew she was home. The trauma of the past few years lives with her still – closer to the surface on the bad days, further from her mind on the good. “I have moments where I feel great … and then I have these moments where it’s catastrophic and I feel as if there’s no meaning,” she says. “But even in those moments, I remind myself that this will finish, this will end.” With the ECHR’s final decision looming, Walker is focused on spending time with her mum in Queensland, rebuilding her life and making art. She is beginning, she says, to feel like herself. “I have definitely started to regain that person, that part of me again. And I think that, in a way, that part of me is what also enabled me to survive.”",News/Law,Nara Walker: the Australian woman suing Iceland ,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jan/29/nara-walker-the-australian-woman-suing-iceland
1/29/2022,"Alittle over a year ago, Anthony Albanese thought he was about to die. As he drove home in his Toyota sedan on 8 January 2021, a Range Rover on the wrong side of the road ploughed straight into him. Recounting the crash this week, he says: “I thought, this is how it ends.” We know the story ended differently. The Labor leader lived, but sustained serious injuries. Recovery took time and protracted medical attention – more than he confessed to at the time.  We are starting here because some of Albanese’s close colleagues say that accident picked him up and set him down in a different place. The reminder that life is short was a prompt from the universe: if you want to be prime minister, then best not to die wondering. Back at the time of the collision, Scott Morrison was airborne on an approval rating north of 60%. With the prime minister in the ascendancy, there were harbingers of internal mischief on the Labor side. One colleague says the crash triggered more than a “life is precious” epiphany – it got the dander up. That trauma disrupted Albanese’s mental cycling between fight or flight. Some context might explain this. Albanese is from the human school of politicians. He hasn’t cauterised his emotions to survive. He has normal responses to pressure, expectation and risk. Flight in this context was the Labor leader visualising the worst-case scenario: after a career spanning the best part of three decades, failing to beat Morrison, an opponent Albanese neither likes nor respects. There are easier paths in life than visualising that particular career coda in full technicolour on the back of your eyeballs at 3am. But the car crash, and the physical and mental reset afterwards, settled things. Henceforth no flight. It would be fight. The colleague says after that accident “it became: I am going to show all of you people.” This small inflection, the sprinkle of grit in the anecdote, the sense of bugger all of you, I’m going for it, feels truer to me. Less authorised history, or pre-campaign myth making. As we drive between Moruya and Mogo on the south coast of New South Wales this week, I pursue Albanese’s own account of the impact of the accident. He ponders the question briefly before saying the crash wasn’t “a lightbulb moment”. Nothing is ever that simple. He insists his core strategy to try to unseat Morrison was already locked and loaded, and he was already on a self-improvement path. But he says the collision sharpened his thinking. “It made me more determined.” As we enter the federal election year, there are two questions to ask about Labor. The first is: does Albanese want to win? Is he battle-ready? The second is: can Labor win? Is there a viable pathway to victory when the election rout in 2019 fattened the government’s margins – particularly in Queensland, the state that generally determines the national government? Dealing with each in turn, colleagues say Albanese is currently in the best mental and rhetorical shape of his leadership. But they also say there is still a way to go. Polls tell us there’s a chunk of voters who have no fixed view about the Labor leader. Out and about in the civilian world beyond politics and the media, I hear the persistent refrain that Albanese is not visible enough. Covid creates its own hierarchy of visibility – premiers first, Morrison next and Albanese after that. The lack of bandwidth makes it tough to introduce yourself to people who don’t know who you are. But the fierce competition for attention has given the Labor leader time to attend to project optimisation. As Morrison lost altitude over the past 12 months, mired in controversy over the vaccination “strollout”, battling the Brittany Higgins furore and the consequences of the Delta wave, Albanese lost more than 10kgs. Bit by bit, as weeks ebbed into months, the wardrobe got sharper. New suits. Old favourites tailored to fit. He waffled less. He also took the hardest decision of his leadership: what Labor would do about climate policy. What is happening substantively is always more important than parsing a makeover. But in Albanese’s case, project optimisation is the most visible manifestation of his hunger for the win. Albanese’s new glasses aren’t in the least bit interesting. The fact he’s actually agreed to wear them is. If you know Albanese, it’s hard to imagine how on earth he consented to the optimisation. Some ambitious politicians enter public life wanting to know how to be the product. This cohort bends into optimal shape without a moment’s hesitation. But Albanese can be stubborn, headstrong and sentimental. He’s an old dog for a hard road, not a soul-selling cynic, or a political ingenue in search of a svengali. As he told the National Press Club this week, his first political campaign was at the age of 12. He won it. He’s already been the chief tactician in a minority parliament, and a confidante of two prime ministers. He’s already risen to the rank of deputy prime minister. Then there’s the person. Albanese, being human, is a ball of contradictions. He’s Labor, master of an institution, a relentless networker – and a lone wolf. He’s both everywhere, and one step removed. His temperament is both soft and spiky. This complexity is a barrier to malleability. His default position on zhooshing would be: stop bothering me with this cosmetic bollocks, I know how to win. Trying to tweak him would be fraught for any backroom attempting it. “I’m not manageable,” he offers from the front seat of the car. This is a humblebrag, obviously. But it’s true in the way he means it. What he’s saying is none of this would be happening if he wasn’t absolutely convinced the metamorphosis matters, to the voters, to the colleagues. Perhaps to himself. Perhaps, fundamentally, this is a test of self-discipline, or resolve. Putting himself firmly in the driver’s seat of project optimisation is also important from an explanatory perspective. If Labor is seeking to beat Morrison by telling voters Albanese is the real deal, it’s best not to subject him to the full Queer Eye treatment. If he looks like he’s been done over by a migratory flock of advertising gurus and image consultants, then Labor is lurching towards a repeat episode of “Real Julia” – an abject disaster. It would reinforce the claim Morrison intends to hammer over the coming months. Albanese isn’t authentic – he’s a left-wing machine man, Bernie Sanders in a better wardrobe, this socialist will confiscate your property and smother your aspirations. Labor is a risk. Albanese presents self-improvement as an enduring trait rather than a new affectation, part of his personal continuum. Tom Uren, his political mentor and father figure, told him to learn something new, and grow as a person, every day. Right now he’s learning how to comport himself like an alternative prime minister. His team is helping, but Albanese says there’s no outside advice. “Have I had any speech therapies or what have you? Absolutely not. I’m conscious, for example, about saying Aust-ray-lia. I’m conscious about that. But that’s me.” After he makes a major speech, he watches back to consider what he could have done better. His inner sanctum includes people he trusts enough to ask for scaffolding – whether it’s a candid performance review, or the wordless prompt of a staffer positioned behind a television camera to give him an line cue. “People know what I need,” he says. “Tim Gartrell (chief of staff) was my first campaign director in 1996. Jeff Singleton (deputy chief of staff) has worked for me for 20 years. Alex Sanchez (senior economics adviser) was in my tute at Sydney University. Jenny Mason (senior adviser) was on Sydney University’s student representative council with me and Paul Fletcher in 1993. There are people who are lifelong supporters, who get me, who know me, and that gives me comfort.” I mention a fascinating profile I read a few years back about Barack Obama. It lingered in my mind because it shared steps Obama had taken to simplify mundane choices so he could focus on the complexities of campaigning and holding office. Reducing his wardrobe to only two suit colours was one example. Does he have a version of this? Albanese says he’s organised in his life to the point where people suspect he’s obsessive. He thinks more and says: “I never put anything off that can be done immediately.” There are two new suits. Not ten. “I wear less different colours. It’s simpler when there’s not much time – white, light blue or dark blue shirts, largely, but not always.” Simplifying and streamlining also extends to articulating his core motivations. He can enunciate those in two sentences. “I appreciate the incredible privilege and honour that I have of leading the Labor party. I feel a great responsibility to get Labor across the line because I think the country needs a Labor government.” Albanese is doing a street walk in Mogo, in the electorate of Gilmore. It’s a Labor-held seat, but it’s in play. High-profile state Liberal Andrew Constance will try to snatch it. As we weave in and out of the shops chosen by the advancers – that old campaign standard – I find myself wondering whether the major parties should simplify things for them and for us by producing the coming election on a sound stage at Fox Studios, with green screen and a reality show cast recruited from marginal seats. It would be no more artificial than this. But then John James, a retired concreter in a blue chesty Bonds singlet with a Rabbitohs tattoo on his arm, wanders into Albanese’s campaign practice lap, piercing my whimsy. Given Albanese often says his mum raised him with three great faiths, the Catholic church, the Labor party and South Sydney Football Club, the arrival of James – who feels more accidental than staged – is a good omen. Albanese looks delighted. The two men have an amiable yack before the caravan rolls into an adjacent hairdresser. Back out on the street, James asks us whether he is going to be on television. In the ensuing back and forth with the stragglers, the concreter volunteers that he feels sorry for Morrison. Why sorry, we wonder? The prime minister has had the bushfires to deal with, then the pandemic. The retiree says everyone is whingeing, but pandemics and bushfires aren’t Morrison’s fault. What about Albanese, one reporter asks? A side step follows. “Mate, I don’t follow politics that much,” he says. “I’m not into it, I don’t argue about it, I don’t go to church, I don’t follow politics, I mind my own business and stay happy.” Now obviously this is just one person, vox popped on one main street, in one Australian region. We haven’t just cracked the secret code that predicts the federal election outcome. But the cameo is memorable. Sticking with my sound stage whimsy, James looks like he’s just wandered out of a separate casting call for the quiet Australians. He’s exactly the voter Morrison actively recruits. In 2019, the year he beat Bill Shorten, the prime minister charted his pathway to victory just two hours up the road at the Shoalhaven Heads Hotel. He spent a break decanting the feelings of his quiet Australians over fish and chips. Without committing himself, our retiree in Mogo has just articulated an apologia for the devil you know. If James represents a default view of disengaged voters who decide election outcomes – poor old PM – not really his fault right – bloody hell people are hard to please – Morrison’s pitch will work. Labor could easily fall short. Morrison has lost a lot of lustre during the past 12 months, particularly in the closing months of last year, and voters are cranky after freedom summer became the Omicron summer. The Coalition’s base is split about vaccines, mandates, and handouts. That, and the unforced errors, makes it hard for Morrison to recline comfortably into incumbency and campaign on his record during the pandemic. He will pivot to the economy and risk. For his part, Albanese has spent the summer traipsing through cane fields and speaking to tourism operators up and down the Queensland coast. The atmosphere for Labor north of the Tweed feels less negative. One government MP characterises the major party arm-wrestle in the state as “alive, but tight”. He says: “We’d lose if the election was now, but it’s not now. It’s down the track, so it’s still there to be won.” Courtesy of the rout in 2019, the Coalition has insurance. It enjoys a substantial buffer in the state. Most government-held seats are held by large margins. When you look at the electoral map, a truism quickly emerges – to secure majority government, Labor needs to pick up seats in Queensland, and given most elections aren’t landslides, all the gains will be hardscrabble. Labor could easily lose the election in Queensland, which explains Albanese’s travel itinerary. Rather than spreading finite resources too thinly, Labor is targeting three Coalition-held seats in Queensland: Longman (3% margin), Flynn (8.7%) and Leichhardt (4.2%). Brisbane (4.9%) is also in the mix. Strategists are crossing their fingers Clive Palmer makes good on a threat to preference against sitting members. The LNP is worried about that eventuality. Given Labor holds such a small amount of territory in Queensland, an orchestrated up yours to incumbents could help. Looking at the national picture, Labor hopes to pick up three seats in Western Australia. (Strategists familiar with the terrain think two is more realistic). Eyes are also on Boothby in South Australia (marginal, but always hard), the northern Tasmanian seats of Bass and Braddon (always volatile), and Chisholm in Victoria. Some think Casey could be in the mix given the retirement of Liberal and former House speaker Tony Smith. New South Wales – where the party machines are currently stretched by a run of state byelections – is looking like a mixed bag for both sides. Labor could lose Gilmore, for example, but pick up the Sydney seat of Reid. The National party is hunting Labor-held seats in the Hunter Valley. Labor would like to make gains on the Central Coast. The pathway to minority government, or to victory, requires a lot of things to go right. It assumes that a national pitch resonates at a time when Australia’s politics have assumed a pre-federation sensibility because of the ascendancy of the premiers. It also assumes voters are interested in a conversation about the future when managing here and now feels hard enough. Of course if voters are sick of Morrison and the Coalition, if the prime minister’s time is up, then the minute seat-by-seat calculations I’ve just shared falls away because a swing takes him out. I ask Albanese, assuming this is a hardscrabble rather than an “it’s time” election, whether there is any possible pathway to victory if Labor can’t win additional seats in Queensland. I struggle to see one. “We will get gains in Queensland,” he says. With those big government margins? “Longman isn’t a big margin,” he says. “Flynn is a big margin, but I am confident about Flynn. We’ll try in Leichhardt. Brisbane, I think, is a real goer. “There’s a potential tipping point here for Morrison. But it is always a challenge for Labor to form government. We’ve formed government from opposition three times since the second world war. “It’s a mountain to climb, but I’m determined to climb it.”",News/Australia news,Labor’s lone wolf: Anthony Albanese embarks on the fight of his life,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/29/labors-lone-wolf-anthony-albanese-embarks-on-the-fight-of-his-life
1/29/2022,"Temperatures over the Great Barrier Reef in December were the highest on record with “alarming” levels of heat that have put the ocean jewel on the verge of another mass bleaching of corals, according to analysis from US government scientists seen by Guardian Australia. On Friday the Morrison government announced $1bn for reef conservation over the next nine years if it wins the next election – a pledge branded by some as a cynical attempt to stop the reef being placed on the world heritage “in danger” list at a meeting in July.  Conservationists and scientists mostly welcomed the pledge, but many said the government needed to greatly improve its greenhouse gas emissions targets and stop supporting fossil fuel projects. In the three months leading up to 14 December, an analysis from scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) says heat stress over the corals reached a level “unprecedented in the satellite record” for that time of year. According to the analysis, temperatures were so hot that between mid-November and mid-December, the minimum temperatures over more than 80% of the reef were higher for that period than previous maximums. Dr William Skirving, of Noaa’s Coral Reef Watch, said his team “were surprised, shocked and concerned” when the analysis, covering each year from 1985, was completed. “There’s never been heat stress like that in our records. It’s completely out of character and speaks to the fact that the minimum temperatures were higher than the previous maximums. This is almost certainly a climate change signal. “Being a scientist in this field in this day and age is sometimes a bit nightmarish. Sometimes I wish I knew a little bit less.” As greenhouse gas emissions accumulate in the atmosphere, the world’s oceans are getting hotter, and scientists say coral bleaching will become more frequent in the short term, whatever happens to emissions. The 2,300km reef has seen five mass bleaching events – in 1998, 2002, 2016, 2017 and 2020 – all caused by rising ocean temperatures driven by global heating. According to the Noaa analysis, which has not been peer reviewed but has been accepted to a scientific journal, the reef headed into the summer with “more accumulated heat than ever before”. Average water temperatures in mid-December were at least 0.5C hotter than the corresponding period for any previous summer when the reef bleached. The peak period for heat stress tends to be in late February and March. Corals get most of their food and colour from the algae that live within them. But if temperatures get too high, the algae separates and leaves the animal bleached white. Corals can recover from mild bleaching but are weaker, more susceptible to disease and reproduce less in the following years.

Extended periods of cloud cover, rainfall and wind could all help reduce temperatures, he said. The Bureau of Meteorology meteorologist Shane Kennedy said monsoonal conditions could deliver cloud and rain in the coming week, but this could clear south of Cairns in the coming days. Associate Prof Tracy Ainsworth, a coral biologist at the University of New South Wales, said cloud cover could reduce the extra stress on corals from sunlight. “It’s sad we’re in a position where we’re hoping for conditions that minimise coral mortality.” Prof Jodie Rummer, a Townsville-based marine biologist, said some corals were bleaching at Magnetic Island, near Townsville. “I’m concerned for the reef and this funding pledge feels a bit like a last-ditch effort [to stop the reef being listed as in danger],” she said. On Friday the prime minister, Scott Morrison, was in Cairns to announce the funding which, if his government was re-elected, would target projects across water quality, pollution, illegal fishing and outbreaks of coral-eating starfish. Reef health monitoring, habitat restoration and scientific research into making corals and habitats more resilient would also be funded. The world heritage committee is due to decide in July whether to place the reef on its “in danger” list. Unesco science advisers recommended the listing last year, and the $1bn pledge comes just days before a 1 February deadline for the government to send a progress report to Unesco. Associate professor Mike Van Keulen, the chair of marine science at Murdoch University, described the Coalition’s pledge as “a cynical token action”. Conservation groups have long called for extra funding to improve water conditions over the reef, which experts say can improve the health of corals and give them a better chance of surviving as temperatures rise. Richard Leck, the head of oceans at WWF-Australia, said the pledge was “positive news for our national icon” and would keep funding at broadly their current levels. “Progress on reducing water pollution has fallen behind the government’s targets to protect the reef, so it’s vital that this investment is applied in a way that markedly improves water quality.” But he said it “needs to be complimented by real action on climate to drive down emissions this decade”. Dr Anita Cosgrove, a Queensland campaigner with the Wilderness Society, said the package was “insufficient to overcome the breadth of challenges”. The Australian Academy of Science president, John Shine, said global heating threatened the reef’s “extraordinary variety of habitats and species”. The Australian Marine Conservation Society water quality expert, Jaimi Webster, said funding to address water pollution and illegal fishing was welcome, but insufficient. Gavan McFadzean, of the Australian Conservation Foundation, said: “A government that is fair dinkum about protecting the Great Barrier Reef would urgently phase out coal, oil and gas – and would not continue to subsidise the growth of fossil fuel industries – to give the reef a chance to survive.” The Queensland Conservation Council director, Dave Copeman, also said the government’s support for fossil fuel projects was putting the reef under threat. Labor’s deputy leader, Richard Marles, questioned whether the Morrison government would follow through on its $1bn pledge. “This is a prime minister who throughout his time in office has completely failed to take any meaningful action on climate change,” he said, adding “you cannot take action on the reef without being serious on climate change, and Scott Morrison is not”. The Greens senator for Queensland, Larissa Waters, said: “A belated cash splash on the Great Barrier Reef is a joke from a government that has turbo-charged the climate crisis imperilling the reef by giving billions to fossil fuels and backing new coal and gas.” Morrison’s pledge was also criticised by one of his own backbenchers. The Queensland Liberal National party senator Gerard Rennick told the ABC it was “unnecessary funding” that was only aimed at “appeasing the United Nations”.",News/Environment,Great Barrier Reef on verge of another mass bleaching after highest temperatures on record,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/29/great-barrier-reef-on-verge-of-another-mass-bleaching-after-highest-temperatures-on-record
1/29/2022,"The Victorian coroner will hold an inquest into the deaths of four children who had been the subject of multiple reports to the state’s child protection authorities before they died. The unrelated children, aged between six months and 13 years old, died between 2015 and 2017, documents before the court show. The children cannot be identified for legal reasons.  The state coroner, Judge John Cain, will investigate how child protection handled reports made about the children, which in some cases occurred on as many as six occasions, or before the child was even born. On Friday, the coroner’s office informed the media that an application had been made by the secretary of Victoria’s department of families, fairness and housing for a suppression order regarding the proceedings. In support of its application, the department provided various details about the children’s cases. This included the extent of their involvement with the children before they died, the extent of their involvement with the siblings of some children, and, in some cases, details about those who had faced criminal charges in relation to the deaths. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The submissions made by Erin Gardner and Estelle Frawley, counsel for the department secretary Sandy Pitcher, contend that Cain should suppress the names of all children subject to the inquest. This was because it balanced the ability to report fairly on the inquest proceedings with obligations not to breach acts that relate to identifying children who were subject to court proceedings. “The suppression order, as currently drafted, appropriately balances the public interest in allowing publication against the public interest that there is no inadvertent breach of [the act] and the importance of protecting sensitive information relating to children,” the department says in its submission. “The current order only suppresses very limited information from publication and is narrow in scope. “Importantly, it allows the publication of the circumstances of the proceeding, including any appropriate recommendations to prevent similar deaths which will allow the coroner to fulfil his important functions and investigate all the matters in the proposed scope of investigation and for the media to report on the outcome of the investigation.” The court was unable to provide further details about the scope of the inquest.",News/Australia news,Victorian coroner to investigate deaths of children who were repeatedly reported as at-risk,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/29/victorian-coroner-to-investigate-deaths-of-children-who-were-repeatedly-reported-as-at-risk
1/29/2022,"Iwas in my early 20s when my partner Rob died suddenly and unexpectedly. As I grappled with the loss, I was told to be grateful for the time we had together. That he wouldn’t want me to be sad. I was told I needed to be strong. That I was lucky I was young enough to find another partner and move on. We call them unspeakable losses because we do not have the vocabulary to speak about them. Nine years after I lost my partner, I lost my older brother Matthew. He was 39. In the days that followed I was told that he wouldn’t want me to be sad. That I should be grateful for the time we had together. That I was lucky that I had another brother. I was told he was watching over us, which felt kind of creepy but also completely untrue. There was no deviation from the script.  We are hardwired to say these things when someone dies because otherwise, it would be too much. Human nature is to put boundaries around the loss, so we know it’s something that happens to other people. We say that they’re in a better place or to just remember the good times, because if we spoke the truth – that tragedy comes for us all, that sometimes life is random and cruel and painful and beyond comprehension – I mean, how would we even function? So, we speak in platitudes. They roll off our tongue. But they don’t help the person who is grieving; they exist to comfort the person on the other side of the loss, those bearing witness to the grief. “I could never ...” people say to those who continue to put one foot in front of the other, as if we have some choice in the matter. Yet it’s just another attempt at “othering” the person. I was no more prepared for my life to implode than anyone else. I was no stronger, braver, more equipped to manage the situation. We position those grieving as somehow superhuman, which is easier than acknowledging that there is nothing more intrinsically human than grief. The world wants to see post-traumatic growth. It wants to see happy endings. In the worst moments of my life, people were telling me that I would learn from this. Come out the other side with a greater appreciation for the small things, as if my brother’s death was some kind of narrative plot device. As if it was a tool for character development and not a tragedy in its own right. Not only do people want you to experience grief and loss unscathed, you must emerge a better person. “How is your mum?” people asked me, following the sudden death of her second-born child. Though it was less of a question and more of a statement. “She’s OK, in the circumstances,” I said, as if by rote. This was the answer people wanted and so I gave it to them, though I was lying. “I can’t even imagine,” they said. Although they could, they were lying too. They were imagining it as the words left their lips. Those experiencing the grief don’t have the luxury of imagination. We are living it. Whether you can or can’t imagine it (and you can) doesn’t change anything. All you are saying is: I tried on your life for a split second and it terrified me. In an effort to help, people try to shrink the loss, to minimise the very real experience of grief. At least they are no longer in pain. At least you got to say goodbye. At least they didn’t battle a long illness. At least, at least, at least, at least. The “at leasts” pile up and contradict each other. But there is no comfort comparing your situation to someone else’s worst day. And by which measure is someone else’s circumstance “worse” than your own anyway? Someone died. The context is irrelevant. It’s part of the false dichotomy of gratitude culture that wants you to only look at what you have and not at what you’ve lost. This is not a glass-half-full situation. We tell those grieving to move on. We hear that we need to get over the loss. Over. On. As if it is something to be climbed. And this is what is missing from the language of loss. It fails to acknowledge that the grief is not a separate entity. It exists within us, and wherever we go, it will follow. At the kitchen table, as family and friends gathered, there was a moment of silence, and then someone mentioned Matthew’s name. Shared a story about him that we’d heard a thousand times before. Someone else added memories of their own. Stories that were brand new. And so it went. We gave each other permission to feel the extent of the loss and the heaviness of the grief. And it changed shape. Lost its spiky edges and became something else entirely. Because this is the power of words. There was a promise in everything said and unsaid that the grief we felt would not live in the past but would be carried forward. It would be shared.

The cloud, which holds our photos and status updates (among other more ominous metadata), seems omniscient and constant. But what if we begin to feel uncomfortable about the footprints we’ve left across it?  What if we would rather not leave years of holiday albums, new car and partner announcements, thoughtless opinion dumps and drunk timeline photos on the internet for anyone to see until the end of time? Following Facebook’s move in 2010, online spaces and social networks such as Google and Twitter have begun introducing native archive tools to their platforms. By enabling you to download a copy of your site history, archive tools help manage your digital presence without erasing it entirely. Different platforms offer different archive and download processes. Facebook makes archiving relatively easy. While logged into your account, start by finding the down-facing arrow in the top right corner of the screen and click “Settings”. This will take you to a page with sub-buttons listed on the left-hand side. There, find and click “Your Facebook information”. Among options to view your Facebook browsing history, temporarily deactivate or permanently delete your account, is a subsection that reads: “Download your information.” From there, follow the pop-up instructions that take you to “Create file”. Wait for your data to prepare, click “Download” and you are ready to go. The downloaded Zip will include a file labelled “index.htm”. This is the easy-to-navigate copy of your Facebook profile. On top of the usual stuff – profile pictures, videos, statuses, messages, friends – will be data you may not know was being collected. Like the time and location of every Facebook login you have made and the keywords used to target ads to you. Over on Instagram, the process is similar. On your profile page, click the three lines in the top right corner; the Menu button. There, search “Download data”, enter your email address and wait patiently for a link to be sent containing a copy of your profile. Then you can deactivate or delete your profile without losing anything you’ve put into it. If you would rather archive specific photos on your Instagram page without downloading and deleting your entire profile, there is an option for that too, albeit a very tedious, manual one (you’ll have to go through each picture one by one). While the process is less streamlined on Twitter, various services exist to make managing your Twitter history easier. The Verge has a comprehensive guide to Twitter cleanups that includes reviews of free and paid services. Depending on the platform, archiving and erasing your digital presence is a simple, one-and-done addition to your life admin to-do list.

1/29/2022,"The world’s richest billionaires have lost more than $50bn (£37bn) this week as their fortunes – mostly held in technology companies – dropped in a “white knuckle” rout on tech shares. Elon Musk, the wealthiest person on the planet, saw his fortune fall by $25.8bn in a single day on Thursday, according to the latest data available, as shares in his electric car company, Tesla, fell 11% to their lowest since October.  Despite the dip – which is roughly equivalent to the annual salaries of 615,000 people earning the average UK salary of £31,000 – Musk is still the richest person alive by some distance. The fortune of Jeff Bezos, the world’s second-richest person and the founder of Amazon, has fallen by $27.8bn since the start of the year to $164bn, according to Bloomberg’s daily tally of billionaires’ fortunes. Amazon shares have dropped by a quarter since November. The billionaires’ paper loses come as the tech-heavy Nasdaq stock exchange in New York has suffered its worst start to the year since 2008 as investors sell off “stay at home” stocks that had performed strongly during pandemic lockdowns and prepare for interest rate rises. “We view this as the most important earnings season for the tech space in potentially the last decade,” Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in a note to clients. “The Street now needs to hear good news at a ‘white knuckle time’ from tech bellwethers.” Microsoft’s co-founder Bill Gates and former chief executive Steve Ballmer, as well as Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, have each seen their fortunes drop by more than $10bn since the start of the year. Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and chief executive of Meta (the company formerly known as Facebook), has seen his paper worth knocked by $15bn or 12% since the new year, sending him falling to number eight in the wealth league table with $110bn. Zuckerberg was leapfrogged by the “Sage of Omaha” investor Warren Buffett, who has risen to sixth with an estimated $111bn. He is the only one of the world’s Top 10 richest people to have made a gain so far this year, with his fortune rising by $2.4bn. Lo Toney, a managing partner at the investment firm Plexo Capital, said: “We have the multi-sector investors who are moving out of tech because with a rising interest rate environment, they typically move over to other sectors that benefit from rising interest rates – financials, insurance. “What we see is that high interest rate environments really punish the growth stocks, the tech stocks in particular,” he told CNBC.

1/29/2022,"Scotland Yard has provoked fury and confusion by revealing it is seeking to have details removed from the official inquiry into Downing Street parties, raising fears that the full report could be delayed indefinitely. MPs labelled the Metropolitan police a broken organisation after the force admitted it had asked the senior civil servant Sue Gray to make “minimal reference” in her inquiry report to matters its officers were now investigating.  Gray’s team is wrangling over whether to publish a pared-back report as early as Monday or wait for the Met’s investigation to conclude, which could take weeks or months. Another option could be to publish a shorter version with redactions next week, and then release the full findings once Scotland Yard’s inquiry is over. One government source said the publication could be delayed indefinitely. Labour said any further delay in publishing the entire report was intolerable. It said the government was in a state of extended paralysis, while some Tory backbenchers described Boris Johnson as a “lame duck” without the authority to tackle the looming cost of living crisis and possible Russian invasion of Ukraine. With Whitehall alive with speculation about why Gray had yet to send her report to Downing Street, Scotland Yard issued a brief statement on Friday morning saying it was in “ongoing contact” with her team about “the content of the report” to “avoid any prejudice to our investigation”. Police stressed they had not asked for the document to be delayed, but their request has left Gray unable to publish the report as she intended. Johnson’s political future may hinge on whether he and senior No 10 staff are exonerated or criticised, and the Met’s intervention prompted concerns that the issue could remain unresolved into the spring. One Tory MP said they feared it would take three months before the full details of Gray’s findings would emerge. They told the Guardian: “What people want is justice and the truth – what they expect is a cover-up. If that’s what happens, we can take another 5% off our standing in the polls. It’s a massive loss for confidence in the police and damaging for the party.” Another called the Met a “broken organisation” and said fears the report would look like a whitewash were the fault of Scotland Yard’s “incompetence”. Downing Street vowed on Friday to release whatever findings it receives from Gray but said the Met should be given “time and space” to complete “its independent work”. Johnson’s spokesperson did not commit to publishing anything further if a watered-down version is handed to No 10 followed by a fuller version some weeks later. Officers are understood to be looking into possible breaches of Covid rules that could warrant fixed-penalty notices, rather than any more serious offences. If those issued with the fixed-penalty notices want to challenge the fine, they would go before a magistrate, not a jury. Those with knowledge of the Met’s thinking said senior officers do not want Gray’s findings of wrongdoing published in detail before those who may be interviewed are spoken to by police, potentially polluting the recall of witnesses. But the Met’s fears that Gray’s report could prejudice its own investigation prompted widespread incredulity, given the risk only arises when a criminal investigation is launched that is expected to lead to arrests followed by a trial by jury. Nazir Afzal, a former chief crown prosecutor for north-west England, called the announcement “absolute nonsense”, adding: “A purely factual report by Sue Gray cannot possibly prejudice a police investigation. They just have to follow the evidence, of which the report will be a part.” Dal Babu, a former Met police chief superintendent, said he was “a little bit confused” about the force’s decision. He said he was “struggling to understand why this report would impede the police investigation”, given it had “no legal standing” and a lot of evidence was already in the public domain. One former senior Met officer with extensive experience of sensitive investigations said the force had unnecessarily got itself into trouble and was concerned by its missteps so far, some of which were branded “brain dead”. The source said: “They are making it up as they go along.” Johnson’s position has been thrown into question by the Met announcement, as it leaves him less likely to be able to draw a line under the issue and restore discipline in the party. One Conservative MP said: “It delays, rather than changes, the underlying position.” Another said the Met’s move had “done what no one has been able to do for weeks and unite the Tory party”, because “all sides are now getting frustrated” at the issue remaining unresolved. The former chief whip Mark Harper pushed for Gray’s report to be published in full. He told the Guardian: “A partial publication with crucial details missing would be an insult to the public.” Roger Gale, a backbencher who has already submitted a letter of no confidence in Johnson, said the soaring cost of living and Russian aggression towards Ukraine required Johnson’s “full and undivided attention”, but instead he was “a lame duck prime minister that is soldiering on”. The government was also accused of being in paralysis by the Labour leader, Keir Starmer. He criticised ministers for being focused on protecting Johnson’s position, while people concerned about the tax rise coming into effect in April and rising bills were “getting no answers from a government mired in sleaze and scandal”. Public health experts on Friday noted the lack of briefings or communication from the government at a time when coronavirus rules had changed, case rates remained very high and Covid was continuing to cause significant disruption in schools. “We’re in a really difficult position, particularly for children and young people, and the government continues to dither and delay,” said Prof Gabriel Scally, a visiting professor of public health at the University of Bristol. “The government is pulling down the blind on things in the hope that we will move on.” Prof Linda Bauld, a public health expert at the University of Edinburgh, said the lack of communication was problematic. “There are continued scientific developments, such as the inclusion of reinfection figures, which people probably need explained,” she said. James Johnson, a pollster with JL Partners who worked in Downing Street under Theresa May, said: “I don’t think the brand damage from the parties fades. Voter perceptions of Johnson have changed for good, barring some major event. “This is very much a Johnson issue, not a wider Conservative party issue. If, sooner rather than later, MPs look to a new leader, then I think you get an almost entire restart moment, and actually I think that you could even see the Conservative government as much as 10 points ahead almost overnight.”",News/Politics,Sue Gray report: fears of ‘indefinite’ delay after Met intervention,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/28/sue-gray-report-fears-indefinite-delay-met-intervention-partygate
1/29/2022,"Millions of graduates face higher repayments on their student loans next year after the government announced a “tax rise by stealth” that will cost many £100 or more a year. A graduate in England earning £30,000 a year will pay an additional £113 in the coming tax year, after the universities minister, Michelle Donelan, made a written statement to parliament freezing the repayment threshold for 2022-23.  The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) thinktank said the move would save the government about £600m if it stayed in place for a year, but if extended the freeze would place a much higher financial burden on graduates. The freeze announced by Donelan will keep the income threshold at which repayments start at £27,295 for those who took undergraduate courses. Had the current rate of inflation been applied it would have risen above £28,000 next year. It applies to the income-contingent loans taken out by English and EU students who had studied at UK universities since 2012. The repayment threshold for postgraduate loans will be frozen at £21,000. A Department for Education (DfE) spokesperson said the freeze would underpin higher education in England with a sustainable funding system. “We need to ensure the system remains fair and open to everyone who has the ability and the ambition to benefit from it,” the DfE said. Labour condemned the move as adding to the cost of living for young graduates, with the higher repayments coming alongside increased taxes and rising housing, food and energy bills. Matt Western, the shadow universities minister, said: “We have a cost of living crisis made in Downing Street, and while No 10 is in paralysis Rishi Sunak is raising taxes on millions of people.” Ben Waltmann, a senior research economist at the IFS, said the announcement in effect constituted “a tax rise by stealth” on graduates on middle incomes. “Graduates with the lowest earnings do not reach the repayment threshold for student loans so they will be unaffected by the freeze. Those with the highest earnings will pay off their loans either way, so the freeze just means that they will repay their loans quicker,” Waltmann said. “For a graduate earning £30,000 … this will be a further hit to the real incomes of these graduates on top of the rising cost of living, the freeze in the personal allowance and the hike in national insurance rates.” Waltmann said that if the threshold freeze was kept in place for just one year the impact on graduate incomes would be moderate. “If it stays in place for longer it could transform the student loan system, with a much lower cost for the taxpayer and a much higher burden on graduates than they thought they had signed up for when they took out their loans.” Nick Hillman, an architect of the loan system introduced by the coalition government in 2012, said the freeze reflected the government’s failure to set out a long-term plan. “Few students or recent graduates will welcome this announcement, but it is sensible because the current system has become out of kilter, with taxpayers paying much more than originally planned,” Hillman said. In 2020-21 loans worth £19bn were given out to about 1.5 million students. Outstanding student loans now total more than £160bn, but most graduates are not likely to repay their debt in full before the loans are written off after 30 years. Average loans now amount to £45,000 per student at the time of graduation.",News/Education,Graduates in England face ‘tax rise by stealth’ on student loans,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/28/graduates-in-england-face-tax-rise-by-stealth-on-student-loans
1/29/2022,"Earners of £100,000 a year could end up paying proportionately less in national insurance than those on middle incomes if a planned increase goes through in April, it has emerged. Figures produced by the Tax Calculator UK website show those earning £100,000 a year will pay just 7% of their overall salary in national insurance contributions (NICs) – the same proportion of their income as someone on £20,000 a year.  The prime minister and the Treasury have come under intense pressure to scrap or at least postpone the £12bn increase in NICs – introduced to cover the shortfall in social care funding – as the cost of living crisis continues to escalate. While the Treasury has repeatedly claimed the increase is “progressive”, figures published on Friday by the online tax calculator show that workers earning between £30,000 and £50,000 will be the hardest hit by far. It calculates that someone earning £50,000 a year will pay £5,086 a year in NICs alone after April – a £505 increase – amounting to 10% of their gross salary. While someone earning £100,000 a year is set to pay the highest national insurance bill – £7,008 a year (an increase of £1,130), the proportion of their pre-tax income paid in NICs will be just 7%. Those on £30,000 a year will pay 9% of their gross salary in NICs. “The increase in national insurance will have a huge effect on workers’ earnings in 2022, especially given soaring energy bills and the fact that inflation is at its highest point in 30 years,” said a spokesperson from Tax Calculator UK. “This data gives us a compelling insight into the fact that lower and average earners will be significantly more squeezed by the NICs hike than those at the very top. “People earning some of the highest salaries in the country are set to pay the same percentage of their salary as a person on £20,000, despite earning five times as much.” From April, NICs are set to be charged at 13.5% on most earnings up to £50,000 but at just 2% on income above that threshold. The figures will be seized upon by Labour, which has called for a fairer, more progressive way to fund social care. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, told the BBC on Friday morning that this was the “wrong tax at the wrong time” and described it as a tax on “ordinary working people and on jobs”. The increase in NICs was announced by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, in last autumn’s budget and will hit wage packets on 6 April, at the same time as a four-year freeze on income tax thresholds. The combination will leave the average household £600 a year worse off in 2022-23, the equivalent of 1.4% of their disposable income, according to the Resolution Foundation thinktank. Business groups are also furious at rising bills for employers. On Friday the Institute of Directors joined calls from other business leaders to scrap the tax rise. A Treasury spokesperson said: “It is not true to say that high earners are least affected by the health and social care levy. Everyone with earnings above the primary threshold will pay a flat 1.25% on their income. “Over half the revenue from the health and social care levy will come from the wealthiest 15% of the population, while over 6 million people on lower incomes will be completely exempt.”",Lifestyle/Money,Middle income earners ‘to be hit hardest’ by national insurance rise,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/28/middle-income-earners-hit-hardest-national-insurance-higher-percentage-uk-rishi-sunak
1/29/2022,"Moeen Ali has insisted that he has “always been ready to captain teams” as he prepares to fill in for the injured Eoin Morgan in the decisive final games of England’s Twenty20 series in West Indies this weekend. As the team’s designated vice-captain, Moeen led the team in Wednesday’s narrow, high-scoring defeat after Morgan injured his right quad in the warm-up, his second international match as captain and first for 18 months.  “For me personally it’s about trying to stay in the game, knowing the situation, trying to understand what the opposition’s strengths are, where they are looking to hit, what they are trying to do and then counter that,” said the 34-year-old. “I’m not sure that too many all-rounders captain in T20 cricket, but I feel like I’ve always been ready to captain teams. Wednesday happened just before the toss, there were five changes and it just felt there was a lot going on. I didn’t feel like I had time to prepare and think about it too much, which sometimes can help. Hopefully going forward it’ll be a little bit easier and calmer.” Moeen only bowled a single over on Wednesday as West Indies took a 2-1 lead in the five-game series, with Adil Rashid England’s most economical bowler with one for 25 from his four overs. “I think the other day showed the difference between him [Rashid] and everybody else in that side,” Moeen said. “Obviously George Garton was making his debut and other guys are still early in their careers, but he showed his class and amazing control. It’s not always about taking wickets – when everybody else seems not to be able to bowl very well, he seems to bowl fantastically well.” Though Reece Topley again impressed, England’s other bowlers all took some punishment. “It’s difficult because West Indies do hit it so far, so well and clean,” Moeen said. “Even though bowlers have the hardest job in Twenty20 cricket, death bowling in particular, we’ve had this issue for a while. We need to change the mindset of the bowlers and the perception people have of us as a death-bowling team. We’re working hard to do that. You’re going to get hit but I think there needs to be a bit more of a plan A, plan B, plan C, so you’ve got places to go if things are not going well.”",Sport/Sport,Moeen Ali ‘always ready’ to captain England as he stands in for Morgan,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/28/moeen-ali-always-ready-to-captain-england-west-indies-stands-in-for-eoin-morgan-cricket-t20
1/29/2022,"For many on both sides of the Irish Sea, the killing of 14 unarmed civil rights demonstrators by members of the British army’s Parachute Regiment on Bloody Sunday in 1972 remains the defining outrage of Northern Ireland’s 30-year Troubles. It was certainly the most politically damaging to Britain. The shootings, which took place in Derry’s Bogside district 50 years ago on Sunday, shocked these islands and the world. They still do and they still should. Bloody Sunday was not the only senseless act of violence during the Troubles. Many more killings were carried out during those 30 years by paramilitary groups from both sides than by the security forces (and more than five times as many in the case of the IRA). But the shootings in Derry made the Northern Ireland crisis deepen dramatically, led to a steep escalation of violence, caused a boost in IRA recruitment and did huge reputational harm to Britain, its Northern Ireland policy and its institutions. Almost as bad as Bloody Sunday itself was the official attempt to cover up what happened, and the lies that were consistently told, including at the highest level of government and in the first judicial inquiry that was announced days after the killings. In the end it would take nearly 40 years before the UK government acknowledged the truth about 30 January 1972 and apologised, after Lord Saville’s inquiry found in 2010 that none of the casualties were posing a threat or doing anything that would justify shooting them. Even now, many aspects of Bloody Sunday remain sources of dispute, in particular the failure to pursue individual soldiers through prosecutions.  Half a century on, it is important to acknowledge this still unquiet legacy. Northern Ireland has been at peace, more or less, since 1998. The threat of violence, including state and paramilitary violence, is decisively diminished. Power is now shared, not hoarded as it still was when the Troubles broke out. Northern Ireland is indeed unrecognisable in many ways from 50 years ago. But not in every way. This weekend’s anniversary has in no sense been the occasion for the different traditions to embrace one another in a spirit of shared sadness and remembrance. Instead, the commemorations retain a distinct edge. The DUP first minister of Northern Ireland, Paul Givan, has refused to attend any of the events at all this weekend (instead, on Thursday, his allies commemorated the killings of two police officers in the days before Bloody Sunday). The SDLP leader, Colum Eastwood, whose constituency includes Derry, has said the parachute regiment were “sent to my city to murder” and has called for an official apology from the army. In Derry on Sunday, the Irish prime minister is likely to be present, but not, it currently appears, the British one. Perhaps this edginess is unavoidable, given the raw emotional power of an event like Bloody Sunday, which many still living remember vividly. Yet it is not many years since the UK and the Irish Republic together navigated some important Irish historical centenaries in imaginative and cooperative ways which helped to strengthen the peace process and good relations across our islands rather than weakening them. We seem to be slipping back from such a farsighted approach now. Nowhere is this more obvious at present than in relation to the Northern Ireland protocol of the UK’s Brexit withdrawal agreement. The instability caused by Brexit washes over into many other things, including anniversaries like Bloody Sunday, and other Troubles milestones still to come. Not everything about Northern Ireland should be blamed exclusively on the British government. But unless the British government engages constructively, consistently and honestly in Northern Ireland, real dangers follow, just as they are doing now.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the Bloody Sunday anniversary: the legacy remains | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/28/the-guardian-view-on-the-bloody-sunday-anniversary-the-legacy-remains
