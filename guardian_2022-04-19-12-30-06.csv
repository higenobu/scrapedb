4/19/2022,"The family of the billionaire trucking magnate Lindsay Fox has donated $100m to the National Gallery of Victoria’s new contemporary space, securing the naming rights for the wing. The Andrews government on Tuesday announced the new space would be named The Fox: NGV Contemporary, to reflect the donation by Lindsay Fox and his wife, Paula, to help fund the new gallery’s construction that is due to begin next year. The state government said the donation was the largest-ever gift made to an Australian museum by a living donor. It builds on the $20m donated by the Ian Potter Foundation in 2020 for the same project. The state’s creative industries minister, Danny Pearson, described the donation from the Fox family as an “extraordinary gift to the people of Victoria”. “Philanthropy can transform cities and NGV Contemporary will be a true gamechanger – one of the largest galleries dedicated to contemporary art and design in the world and a global architectural icon,” Pearson said. NGV’s new contemporary gallery will showcase modern art, design, fashion and architecture of local, national and international significance in the heart of the transformed Melbourne Arts precinct. The Andrews government has invested $1.7bn in transforming the precinct. The Fox family has a record of making financial contributions to the NGV, including acquisitions of major works of art and design. Paula Fox – who sits on the NGV’s board – said she hoped the donation would inspire other philanthropists to make donations to the gallery and “make this an icon for the future”. The NGV director, Tony Ellwood, praised the leadership of the Fox family for the arts sector, noting the donation would have a “real, tangible impact”.

The government has estimated more than 11,000 jobs will be created over the life of the project and the gallery will generate hundreds of ongoing creative sector jobs when it opens in 2028. NGV Contemporary will look out onto new public parklands connecting St Kilda Road in Southbank to Melbourne’s riverfront. Last month, the government unveiled the final design of the building – by Angelo Candalepas and Associates – a competition judged by a jury.

4/19/2022,"On Sunday Anthony Albanese was asked if Labor supports the Coalition’s Operation Sovereign Borders policy and the retention of temporary protection visas. The Labor leader replied “yes” but later clarified his answer, saying that although Labor supports offshore processing and resettlement in third countries: “We don’t support temporary protection visas.” So which aspects of the Coalition’s policies towards asylum seekers and refugees does Labor support, and what are the remaining differences? Operation Sovereign Borders refers to a military-led response to asylum seekers and refugees arriving in Australia by boat, proposed by the Tony Abbott-led opposition in mid-2013 and then enacted by the Coalition once in government. According to the Coalition’s policy document, the main measures were to: Reintroduce temporary protection visas for people found to be refugees Hold asylum seekers in detention on Manus Island and Nauru while processing their refugee claims Instruct the Australian defence force to turn back boats “where it is safe to do so” No. In 2007 Labor was elected promising to end the “Pacific solution” of offshore processing, and instead hold asylum seekers at Christmas Island while processing their refugee applications. After asylum seeker boats restarted, Labor reintroduced offshore processing – so this element of the policy was bipartisan by the time of the 2013 election. Labor didn’t fully close the door on boat turnbacks but they were an ambiguous feature of Labor policy until a change championed by the then leader, Bill Shorten, at the party’s 2015 conference. Before that conference Albanese criticised the change, and he voted against it, explaining that he “couldn’t ask someone else to do something that [he] couldn’t”. But in 2018 Albanese reversed his position, explaining that “circumstances had changed”. “The government’s policies have stopped the boats,” he said. “They’re not coming, so the circumstances of rejecting boat arrivals has been achieved.” The shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, confirmed on Tuesday that Labor “completely supports Operation Sovereign Borders – offshore processing, regional resettlement and boat turnbacks where safe to do so”. “No one who has attempted to come by boat since the operation of Sovereign Borders will be allowed to settle in Australia.” The Rudd government abolished temporary protection visas in 2008, opposed efforts to reintroduce them in 2013, and Labor reconfirmed its opposition to them at the 2015 conference. Nevertheless, the Abbott government reintroduced TPVs in December 2014. On Monday Scott Morrison seized on Albanese’s answer to argue that Labor had “learned nothing when it comes to border protection” because axing TPVs had been a “green light” to people smugglers under the Rudd government. On Tuesday the home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, claimed: “You can’t say that you support Operation Sovereign Borders if you don’t support temporary protection visas, because it is one of the three pillars.” This depends how Operation Sovereign Borders is defined. On the one hand, TPVs are included in the Coalition’s 2013 policy document. On the other, TPVs pre-date the operation and are not given to unauthorised maritime arrivals who arrived after the deadline in 2013, when both major parties agreed people would not be resettled in Australia. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Andrews told Radio National they were a “key part of the deterrent” – even though both major parties support turnbacks, and people who come by boat cannot settle in Australia on a TPV. “It is part of the deterrent message … We want to make it very very clear you will never settle here in Australia,” she said. “You can’t undermine the policy by saying one part doesn’t matter any more.” Keneally told Radio National TPVs were no longer necessary because people who come by boat “will be turned back or sent to Nauru”. “Nobody has gone on a temporary protection visa who has attempted to come by boat since the introduction of Operation Sovereign Borders. “The only people in Australia on TPVs came under the Liberal and Labor government before the introduction of Operation Sovereign Borders. They’ve been living in the country for more than a decade: they live, they work, they pay taxes, they employ Australians.” Keneally said the only different between that cohort and other refugees was they had to reapply for their visas every three or five years, a “costly and wasteful exercise … for no good end”. She said the idea that abolishing TPVs was a pull-factor was “desperate” and “a lie”. Despite the Coalition accusing Labor of flip-flopping on border protection, the Coalition had a flip-flop of its own shortly before the election was called. The Morrison government reversed its opposition to the New Zealand resettlement deal, despite arguing for years this could provide a “back-door” to Australia and could restart boat arrivals. For better or worse, Labor has agreed with the Coalition that nobody who came by boat since 2013 will be resettled in Australia. There is bipartisan support for boat turnbacks, offshore detention and third-country resettlement. The only remaining disagreement is TPVs, a policy plank that could semantically be considered part of Operation Sovereign Borders but is not logically connected to the deterrent because nobody who boards a boat now will be resettled in Australia. The scary website designed to deter asylum seekers from coming to Australia makes no mention of visa categories. “No one who travels illegally to Australia by boat will be allowed to remain in Australia,” it says, and that seems deterrent enough.",News/Australia news,Factcheck: is Labor’s policy on asylum seekers and refugees any different to the Coalition’s?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/19/factcheck-is-labors-policy-on-asylum-seekers-and-refugees-any-different-to-the-coalitions
4/19/2022,"Labor has accused Angus Taylor of attempting to repeat past “climate scare campaigns” and called on the energy minister to release government modelling that he claims shows electricity price rises would have a “devastating impact” if Labor is elected. News Corp tabloids on Tuesday published stories on their front pages claiming government modelling showed consumers would on average be $560 a year worse off by 2032-33 under an ALP policy to accelerate the construction of new electricity transmission links. Taylor, who is also the emissions reduction minister, issued a press release making the same claim, but the statement did not explain how the numbers were reached or who did the analysis. His office did not respond to a request for the modelling on Tuesday morning. Chris Bowen, ALP’s climate change and energy spokesman, said the government release was a “desperate attack” and “just the latest in more than a decade of climate scare campaigns from the Liberals”. Labor’s policy is to create a $20bn “rewiring the nation corporation” charged with making decisions on new transmission links to allow a faster influx of large-scale solar, wind and batteries in regional renewable energy zones. Bowen announced on Saturday he had tested positive for Covid-19, and was not available for broadcast media interviews on Tuesday. In a statement he said the Coalition’s attack showed it did not believe solar and wind were the cheapest form of energy, or that the world’s climate emergency was “Australia’s jobs opportunity”. “It also shows that the Morrison government’s last-minute conversion to net zero is a fraud,” he said. “If the Morrison government is so proud of its so-called ‘modelling’ it should release it publicly for scrutiny, not selectively quote from it and keep it locked away. Where is the modelling? Who conducted it? What are its assumptions?” Taylor said Labor wanted to “gold-plate” Australia’s electricity grid by bringing forward 11 pieces of energy infrastructure that would lead to the cost of poles and wires – which make up nearly 50% of consumer bills – increasing significantly. He said only two of the 11 – the Marinus link between Tasmania and Victoria and the KerangLink between Victoria and New South Wales had been considered “actionable” by the Australian Electricity Market Operator. Experts say electricity prices are likely to be volatile and potentially increase whoever is in power after the 21 May election. Wholesale power prices – which make up about a third of consumer bills – have soared in recent weeks, in part due to the cost of coal and gas increasing due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine disrupting global energy markets. Danny Price, managing director of Frontier Economics, said he had no involvement in the government modelling. He said he believed modelling for Labor by the consultants RepuTex that suggested power prices would fall as the grid was transformed was “ridiculous”, but that an additional $20b of network investment would be required whoever was in power. He said the government’s analysis appeared a response to Labor claiming its policy would “unlock” an additional $58b of electricity investment, but it was unclear that this was really additional investment beyond what would happen anyway. In reality, Labor’s policy may just bring forward investment. He said the ALP and RepuTex had been unclear about this. Price said wind and solar generated electricity more cheaply than fossil fuels, but the cost of building new assets – a lot more solar and wind supported by “firming” power, including batteries, and transmission lines – to replace the country’s ageing coal plants would be required in any case to meet the bipartisan target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. “The big difference is how quickly you get there and how well you do the transition. Labor wants to get there more quickly than the government and that increases the costs sooner. But either way the costs are going to go up,” Price said. Bruce Mountain, director of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, was quoted in the government press release as last year saying he was “sceptical of any claim that more transmission equals lower prices”. He told Guardian Australia he maintained this position but he had also been sharply critical of the Coalition’s energy policies. He said there was an overwhelming case that localised batteries were the best way to drive a cheap transition to clean energy, and both major parties should leave direct intervention in electricity networks to state governments. “I think the case for direct intervention by the federal government is weak. The evidence of it not going well under the current government is manifest,” he said. “I think we should not be making the problem worse.” Tony Wood, energy program director with the Grattan Institute, was quoted in Taylor’s press release saying last year it was “hard to see how the numbers would deliver the savings they [Labor] suggest”. He said he stood by the statement, but accepted that Labor’s proposal to bring forward investment that would have happened anyway at a lower cost of capital could deliver some savings. He said both major parties were guilty of basing policy decisions on scenarios from economic models, rather than just using the modelling as an indicative guide, and “that will almost always be bad policy because the model will always be wrong”. Bowen said RepuTex were the country’s “top energy economists” and the government had also used them to model the electricity market.",News/Australia news,Labor accuses Angus Taylor of ‘desperate’ climate scare campaign over energy claims,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/19/labor-accuses-angus-taylor-of-desperate-climate-scare-campaign-over-energy-claims
