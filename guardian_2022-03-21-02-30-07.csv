3/21/2022,"It had hardly been a wobble for Manchester City. A couple of 0-0 draws, the first against Sporting in a Champions League tie that was already sewn up; the second at Crystal Palace in the Premier League. But when the club give their critics so little ammunition, anything will be seized upon, particularly with Liverpool so remorseless, hoovering up the space behind them in the league. This was a brutal flexing of City’s authority, a step into a fifth FA Cup semi-final in six seasons under Pep Guardiola, the manner of their surge to victory in the closing stages taking the breath. Southampton had been game opponents and the substitute Che Adams had a golden chance for 2-2 in the 74th minute only to shoot too close to Zack Steffen after good work from Mohamed Elyounoussi. City responded as if they had been personally affronted. Guardiola had introduced Phil Foden and Riyad Mahrez as substitutes after the hour and now they turned the screw. Foden’s goal for 3-1 was a shot of vicious power, the ball exploding off his left boot from the edge of the area to zip past Fraser Forster and, when Mahrez lashed inside the near post minutes later, some of the Southampton support made for the exits. They missed Mahrez and Raheem Sterling blowing glorious late chances as their team fell apart. It is one thing to match the City machine for the majority of a contest. Quite another to do so over the duration. Southampton had dreamed of a third FA Cup semi-final appearance in five seasons. It was laid waste with the minimum of ceremony. These are discombobulating times, geopolitics casting a shadow over the sport we love, and the City support have had to process the deeply uncomfortable sight of their owner, Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, welcoming the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, to the UAE on Friday. Chris Bryant has questioned whether Sheikh Mansour is a “fit and proper person to be owning a football club,” saying it would be “good to see the back of him.” The game goes on. It always does. The focus of Guardiola and his City players was on the pitch and they took a grip on the tie after 12 minutes when Raheem Sterling made the breakthrough. It was horribly soft from a Southampton point of view, Jack Stephens getting his feet into a tangle and fluffing an attempted clearance inside his area, but sympathy from City was nonexistent. Gabriel Jesus collected the ball, moved it to Sterling and his shot deflected off Tino Livramento to beat Forster. Southampton blinked into the sunlight. Moments earlier, they had been inches from taking the lead, the width of the far post standing in the way of Adam Armstrong. Now they had it all to do. Armstrong’s chance followed a sharp run on to an excellent Oriol Romeu through-ball and he pulled his shot past Steffen and towards the far corner. The calculations were only marginally awry. Before that, Sterling had sliced a shot from a tight angle after an Ilkay Gündogan surge and the first half rattled along at pace, both teams committed to getting on to the front foot and zipping the ball about. Southampton deserved the equaliser in first-half stoppage time for their positivity, as much as anything else. With Shane Long and Adam Armstrong setting the tempo from the front, they pressed high and Livramento was a threat when he drove forward from right-back. Adam Armstrong had snatched at a presentable shooting chance on 24 minutes and it was his namesake, Stuart, who sparked the move for 1-1, although the goal was coloured by extreme good fortune. Running on to the pass up the inside-right, Elyounoussi saw Steffen leave his line and then retreat; stuck in a kind of no-man’s land. Elyounoussi went for the cut-back and watched the ball hit Ayermic Laporte and spin into the net. Now it was City’s turn to wonder what was going on and, when the half-time whistle went, Kyle Walker blasted the ball out of the stadium in frustration. His team had been so close to going 2-0 up in the 27th minute when João Cancelo beat Livramento to cross for Gündogan only for his first-time effort to come back off the post. Rodri also whistled a shot wide from distance. It remained fast and furious in the second half and perhaps Mohammed Salisu was momentarily scrambled by the intensity of it all. It was a poor decision from him to stretch into a tackle on Gabriel Jesus as the City forward ran up the right-hand side of the penalty area because the danger was not pronounced. Jesus pulled a stop-and-go move, Salisu went into him and it felt as though the air had been sucked out of the stadium. Mike Dean’s penalty award was correct and Kevin De Bruyne jammed the kick into the bottom corner, Forster narrowly failing to get his hand down in time. Could Southampton respond again? After Mahrez had spurned a volleyed opportunity, Adams got on the end of Elyounoussi’s cross to raise the hopes of the home crowd. When he could not finish, City moved up through the gears.",Sport/Football,Manchester City produce late flourish to surge to victory at Southampton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/20/southampton-manchester-city-fa-cup-match-report
3/21/2022,"Charles Leclerc won the opening race of the new Formula One season with a dominant win at the Bahrain Grand Prix. He took a Ferrari one-two with teammate Carlos Sainz after a dramatic race where Red Bull’s challenge fell to pieces in the final laps, with reigning champion Max Verstappen and his teammate Sergio Pérez going out with engine problems. It allowed Lewis Hamilton and George Russell to grab an unlikely third and fourth place for Mercedes,with Kevin Magnussen taking an impressive fifth for Haas. Leclerc and Verstappen had grappled in a thrilling wheel-to-wheel battle in the mid-part of the race, a fight which had looked to be going the distance until both the Red Bull’s went out with power unit failures. Mercedes, who had expected to be off the pace, toiled in their uncompetitive car, but did everything required to be in position to take advantage when their chance came at the very death. In pace terms Ferrari and Red Bull were the class of the field under F1’s new regulations but where Ferrari had the perfect start, Red Bull were left pointless and facing a difficult inquiry into just what happened. Leclerc took the flag after a consummate display marked by his calm command at the front and his staunch refusal to be cowed when Verstappen came at him. Passed twice in two laps, Leclerc fought back both times to regain the lead and then hold it for a deserved victory. Ferrari, who effectively wrote off the 2021 season, in putting all their resources into developing this year’s car, have reaped the benefits. Their engine has made a clear step forward as amply demonstrated by the improvements in other Ferrari powered teams Haas and Alfa Romeo. Equally their car is, on the form of this opening weekend, one of perhaps the best they have produced since they last won the drivers’ title with Kimi Raikkonen in 2007. This is Leclerc’s third win and the first for Ferrari since Sebastian Vettel claimed victory for the Scuderia at Singapore in 2019.

3/21/2022,"Ministers are looking “sympathetically” at plans to stop the government buying health goods made in China’s Xinjiang province when the health and social care bill returns to the Commons later this month. The move would be a first sign that the government is willing to toughen its approach to authoritarian regimes in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine. In an interview at the weekend, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, said the west still needed to apply pressure on the Chinese government not to support the Russian invasion of Ukraine. A backbench amendment already passed in the Lords and sponsored by the former Conservative chief whip, Lord Blencathra, is gaining support across the political spectrum in the Conservative party, including some One Nation MPs, as well as traditional Tory opponents of the Chinese regime. The amendment to the health and social care bill passed with cross-party support, but little fanfare, in the Lords earlier this month. It will be debated when the bill returns to the Commons, most likely in the week beginning 28 March. It would ban NHS procurement from regions where the government believes there to be a “serious risk of genocide”. Ministers have already tried to buy off the rebels by proposing a review of health supply chains, but now may go further and promise not to procure goods from Xinjiang on grounds of risk of forced labour. The Foreign Office has resisted any proposal that requires anyone save the international courts to decide unequivocally if genocide is taking place, including in Xinjiang. It has fiercely opposed the UK domestic courts, or ministers, being given that role. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, is said to be keen to clean up health supply chains, but may come under pressure from the Foreign Office not to do anything that disturbs relations with China at a sensitive time. Yet pressures are also building for a tougher approach. At the weekend, in an interview with the Times, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said the west had in the past focused too much on cheap goods at the expense of freedom and security. It is known that the government has bought hundreds of millions of pounds of medical equipment sourced in whole or part from China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, despite widespread reports of forced labour there – facts that are not denied by the government. Conservative MP Nusrat Ghani said: “I hope the government will take ownership of this important initiative. It is awful to think that PPE we have been wearing through this pandemic may have been made by Uyghur forced labour. We have a duty to protect the NHS from involvement in the heinous things done to Uyghur people. This amendment is a proportionate and reasonable way of keeping the UK away from it.” Blencathra’s amendment was phrased so as not to require the UK to announce that there is genocide in Xinjiang, but that may not satisfy Foreign Office policy objections. The UK government is already bound to assess its suppliers for a risk of slavery, and this extra duty would mandate that an assessment of a “serious risk” of genocide is performed by the government and taken into account during public procurement. The amendment has the support of the British Medical Association, a strong advocate of public procurement as a means of protecting ethical standards.",News/World news,UK considering ban on NHS procurement of Chinese goods made in Xinjiang,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/uk-considering-ban-on-nhs-procurement-of-chinese-goods-made-in-xinjiang
3/21/2022,"Joe Sheehan, the Ipswich manager, called for more teams to be promoted from the third tier to the women’s Championship following his team’s gutsy performance in a 1-0 FA Cup quarter-final defeat to the Women’s Super League side West Ham. “I think there should be loads [of teams being promoted],” said Sheehan. “There are so many clubs like ours that are doing so much, that are investing so much, that are committing so much. I want us all to achieve, I want us, Southampton, Wolves, [Nottingham] Forest, teams that are really trying to do things to a really high level, all to be rewarded.” Sheehan’s frustrations stem from the fact that the winner of the FA Women’s National League South is not guaranteed promotion, but must compete in a play-off against the National League North winners for the solo promotion spot available in tier two. “I understand it’s a competition and results on the pitch should reward it,” he said. “But we play 26 league games and could win 24 and not go up. I just don’t get it. But four go down. I understand that they are trying to rejig things a bit, but there’s too much good going on in tier three, and areas of tier four.” Ipswich are currently top of the league, four points clear of Oxford United and 13 clear of Southampton, who have five games in hand. Chelsea and Manchester City powered into the Women's FA Cup semi-finals with comfortable victories against Birmingham and Everton respectively on Sunday. They join West Ham, following their win at Ipswich, and Arsenal, who saw off Coventry United on Friday, in the draw on Monday. Chelsea produced a superb second-half display to thrash Birmingham 5-0 at Kingsmeadow. The first half was tight but last season's double winners did not look back after Magdalena Eriksson opened the scoring on the stroke of half-time. Drew Spence doubled the lead before Beth England added a brace and Niamh Charles also got on the scoresheet. Jonna Andersson headed against the bar late on in a dominant showing. City cruised through with Lauren Hemp twice on target in a 4-0 rout of Everton at the City Football Academy. Hemp scored either side of half-time, first smashing in from close range and then flicking in at the near post from a corner, after Lucy Bronze had earlier hit the post. Caroline Weir added a third with a brilliant long-range strike before Ellen White wrapped up the scoring in stoppage time. PA Media  In front of a sold-out crowd of over 2,000, the Tractor Girls impressed against a team that plays two tiers above them and is currently on a best ever WSL points tally. “Physically I think we’re closer than I thought we would be, which is great,” said Sheehan. “Even for us to still match them and work as hard as we did with eight, nine, 10 minutes to go was still good. We’ve got players that are still 17, 18, 19 and they’re always going to take more time to get to the level.” Lisa Evans broke the deadlock when Mel Filis trickled a pass in behind and the on-loan Arsenal player lifted it neatly over the Ipswich goalkeeper Sarah Quantrill in the first half. Before that, Quantrill had made a smart save onto the post from Lucy Parker’s header and Sheehan praised his goalkeeper and the resilient back line that kept West Ham quiet. “Sarah’s brilliant. She always comes up and delivers in big moments,” said Sheehan. “That was a really good save. But I didn’t think they peppered her, we defended really well, we defended the spaces that we thought they would exploit really well.” Olli Harder, the West Ham manager, was full of praise for the opposition, but never felt like his side lost control. “I thought we could have done more with some of the opportunities that we did create, but the bottom line is we were in control of 95% of the game in regards to making sure that they weren’t a threat and we managed to score,” he said. For Ipswich, there are six games left to be in with a chance of promotion, while West Ham go into Monday night’s draw for the semi-finals with Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City. Harder is hoping for a home draw after three away games in a row in the cup and is an advocate for a neutral ground for the semi-finals. “The men’s FA Cup, in the semi-final, they play at Wembley. I don’t see why we shouldn’t be doing that,” he said. “We talk a lot about things being equal and all the rest of it, I’m not sure why we need to be playing a home semi-final or an away semi-final, a neutral ground is fine. Maybe it doesn’t need to be Wembley, obviously there’s less spectators, I understand that, but surely there are some good neutral venues that we can pick that would be conducive to both teams.”",Sport/Football,Lisa Evans strike sees West Ham edge out Ipswich in Women’s FA Cup,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/20/ipswich-west-ham-womens-fa-cup-match-report
3/21/2022,"Frank Lampard accused his Everton players of lacking “the bollocks” to perform at the required level after a flaccid performance ended in a 4-0 FA Cup quarter-final defeat by an excellent Crystal Palace. Everton faded alarmingly after conceding the opening goal after 25 minutes, and Lampard queried whether confidence alone was the issue. “There is only so much you can keep trying to butter someone up to get confidence,” the manager said. “You’re playing at the cut-throat end of football; this is the FA Cup quarter-finals. If you haven’t got the confidence to play, you can flip it and say: ‘Have you got the bollocks to play?’ Apologies but that’s the football term. “We didn’t play that badly today, Palace didn’t play that well. It was a lack of confidence, and a lack of what I just said. It wasn’t tactics. Palace couldn’t get out of their half in the first 20 minutes.” Asked about the difficulty of altering that dynamic, Lampard seemed fatalistic, and keen also to point the finger of blame at those who preceded him in the job. “It’s a challenge because it’s been there quite a long time before I got here. I don’t have a magic wand to get inside people’s heads and change the resilience across a whole squad. That’s a work in progress. So we just have to work on that, as frustrating as it is for me and for the 4,000 fans who travelled down.” Lampard saw other possible explanations for his team’s showing, not least the demands of playing so soon after Thursday evening. “Two things hindered us. One was the scheduling. The reality is we could have played at three or four o’clock but the broadcasters want to show other games. There’s Allan’s suspension, which didn’t help us.” He was, though, adamant that defeat at Palace should have no effect on the battle to stay in the Premier League. “It should be nothing. Every time we win people talk about momentum, every time we lose people talk about damage done. In reality we need to be bigger and stronger than that.”",Sport/Football,Frank Lampard lambasts players after Everton crumble at Crystal Palace,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/20/frank-lampard-accuses-everton-players-of-lacking-bollocks-after-fa-cup-loss
3/21/2022,"Liz Cheney, one of two Republicans on the January 6 committee, does not regret her vote against Donald Trump’s first impeachment, for withholding military aid to Ukraine in an attempt to extract dirt on rivals including Joe Biden. But Cheney also said on Sunday she was focused on lessons learned from that impeachment as she pursues the investigation of the deadly Capitol attack, the event which led to Trump’s second Senate trial. Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, the other Republican on the January 6 panel, were among 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump second time round, for inciting an insurrection. Kinzinger has said that in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, he regrets backing Trump in his first impeachment. In an interview with NBC’s Meet the Press, Cheney was asked about her vote against impeachment on Ukraine. “All of us who are in positions of public trust have an obligation to the constitution,” she said, adding: “Watching the hearings, watching the evidence that was put on for the first impeachment, at the end of the day, the evidence that was put on didn’t make the case. “The January 6 situation and attack is obviously something that is fundamentally different. We all watched that unfold in real time. We all lived through that attack.” Supporters Trump told to “fight like hell” in service of his lie about electoral fraud attacked the Capitol in an attempt to stop certification of Joe Biden’s victory. A bipartisan Senate report connected seven deaths to the riot and around 800 people have been charged. Cheney said: “I will say that the January 6 committee is very much focused on lessons learned from [Trump’s] first impeachment and very much focused on making sure the American people have all of the facts and the truth about what happened.” Kinzinger will retire at the midterm elections in November, rather than face a Trump-endorsed challenger. Cheney will fight it out. Though a stringent conservative, on January 6 at least the daughter of the former defense secretary and vice-president Dick Cheney has emerged as a rare figure able to bridge the partisan divide. On NBC, she was asked if the January 6 committee would make criminal referrals – the subject of intense speculation, particularly regarding Trump as he flirts with another run for the White House. “Our first priority is to make recommendations,” Cheney said. “And we’re looking at this, like do we need additional enhanced criminal penalties for the kind of supreme dereliction of duty that you saw with President Trump when he refused to tell the mob to go home after he had provoked the attack on the Capitol. “So there will be legislative recommendations, and there certainly will be information. “And I can tell you, I have not learned a single thing since I have been on this committee that has made me less concerned or less worried about the gravity of the situation and the actions that President Trump took and also refused to take while the attack was under way.”",News/US news,Liz Cheney does not regret vote against Trump Ukraine impeachment,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/20/liz-cheney-trump-ukraine-impeachment-capitol-attack
3/21/2022,"“Are you not entertained?” Paddy “The Baddy” Pimblett shouted deep inside a roaring Saturday night scouse house party which dominated the UFC’s first promotion in Europe in three years. A few minutes earlier he had secured a victory, when forcing Rodrigo Vargas to submit, which fulfilled his prediction of a first-round stoppage. His great friend, and “big sister” from Liverpool, “Meatball” Molly McCann, had already produced an even more remarkable finish already with a stunning third-round knockout which lit up the 02 Arena in London on a transformative night for the garrulous scouse duo and British MMA. There were seven British winners on the night, including another impressive first-round stoppage for the heavyweight Tom Aspinall, and the UFC president, Dana White, described it afterwards as the most enjoyable promotion in the history of his organisation. White was so caught up in the fevered atmosphere that he made the unprecedented decision to award a $50,000 bonus to the winner of every one of the nine bouts which ended in a stoppage – rather than rewarding just one fighter on the night. There was no doubt, however, that this was the Paddy and Molly Show as the two highly distinctive fighters from Liverpool lived up to their pre-fight hype. In only his second UFC contest, Pimblett received an ecstatic reception as he strutted to the octagon. His floppy blond mop-top, goofy grin and pale lightweight frame, devoid of a single tattoo, means that Pimblett looks so unlike a traditional UFC fighter. Vargas, his imposing opponent from Mexico, glowered menacingly but the 27-year-old from a council estate in Huyton kept grinning. The switch in Pimblett’s cheerful mood came only a minute before the cage door shut when he was introduced. Rather than acknowledging the crowd Pimblett looked suddenly concentrated as he stared back at the Mexican who had promised to teach him a harsh lesson. Vargas started with intent and a hard right hand rocked Pimblett. After 18 seconds of the contest Vargas had taken Pimblett down and pinned him to the canvas as the Mexican drew on his upper-body strength and jiu-jitsu skills. Pimblett’s explosive striking had sealed a first-round victory on his UFC debut in Las Vegas in September but, throughout his MMA career, his submission work on the ground has been exceptional. He had also spent weeks in training camp working on his grappling and had flown in a leading American wrestler, Chasen Blair, at his own expense to develop his skillset. There was still a sense of jeopardy and a hush fell across the arena as a transfixed crowd waited to see if Pimblett could escape the tightening grip of Vargas. Slowly, inexorably, Pimblett began to wrest back control. There was a roar as Pimblett broke sufficiently free so that he could gain enough leverage to rise to his feet – and they continued grappling in upright positions. Then, three minutes into the first round, the contest changed dramatically as Pimblett’s left leg wrapped around Vargas’ sturdy limbs and he completed a slick judo move which allowed him to throw the Mexican to the canvas. Within seconds, Pimblett’s left arm turned into a vice around Vargas’s neck. He began to squeeze and choke his opponent and, after three minutes and 49 seconds of the first round, the end came. Vargas tapped out in surrender for he was helpless against the force of that rear naked choke. Pimblett raced across the cage. He climbed the fence and headed straight for White, who sat next to Eddie Hearn and Anthony Joshua – as the boxing promoter and former world heavyweight boxing champion smiled in surprise while Pimblett reminded the UFC head-honcho that he was on his way to becoming, in his words, the “main man” and “new cash cow”. He was soon back in the cage and being hugged by a jubilant McCann. It took a while for the fighting friends to be separated but then Paddy the Baddy was at his motormouth best. “I’m never, ever, ever, ever in a boring fight, lad,” he told Michael Bisping, the former UFC world champion from Manchester. “I have to get a punch to the face to get woke up and I’ll have a nice little shiner in the morning to prove it.” Rating his performance as “only a five or six out of 10”, Pimblett focused instead on the crowd and his rocketing fame as he and McCann become such an irresistible double-act. “See this arena? The 02? Too small, too small. Get me a stadium. Get us to Anfield and we’ll fill it.” White confirmed that the success of Saturday night’s promotion meant the UFC would return to the UK later this year. Pimblett, an ardent Liverpool fan, has set his heart on fighting at Anfield and believes that he and McCann, who supports Everton just as passionately, would draw a crowd of 70,000. In typical Paddy the Baddy fashion, Pimblett then said his next battle would be with the billionaire owner of Facebook and Instagram. “Mark Zuckerberg, lad, I’m going to punch your head in. I’m sick of you, lad. I’m sick of you shutting my Instagram account down when all I’m doing is helping charities, helping people with mental health problems. You’re the biggest bully in the world.” There was still time for a tribute to the 97 Liverpool fans who died at Hillsborough. “I was gonna sing F the Tories but the world is too full of hate at the minute,” Pimblett said. “We need positivity. Will everyone sing with me?” He turned to the crowd and led the chant: “Just-tice for the 97 … Just-tice for the 97 …” Meatball Molly, with an Everton scarf draped around her neck, joined the singing. She was still reeling in delight after a milestone performance less than an hour earlier. Facing Luana Carolina, a Brazilian woman with a considerable reach advantage, McCann had been dominant in the opening round. She looked close to sealing an early stoppage with her superior punching as blood seeped from Carolina’s face. McCann also expended so much energy, on such an emotionally charged night, and her intensity dropped a little in the second round even though she again won it clearly. Carolina had five minutes left in the third and final round to salvage her night but McCann was intent on closing the show. A straight left jolted Carolina who, defiantly, beckoned McCann to come at her again. The Liverpool fighter did not need any invitation. Stalking the taller Brazilian, she waited for her moment. When Carolina raised her left knee, McCann shaped to grab it before, ducking and swivelling away, she spun around in a tight circle and completed the most stunning move of the night. Her back elbow crashed into the face of her stricken opponent. Carolina was out cold even before she hit the canvas, her arms spread wide in utter oblivion. McCann wheeled away, her mouth open in amazement and joy. She confirmed in the octagon that the spinning back elbow stoppage, which is so rare, had been a move “we drilled every day” in the gym. McCann then yelled out a tribute to her city and to Everton: “Liverpool that was for you! Up the Toffees!” Watching her astonishing knockout in the dressing room before his own fight, Pimblett had hollered in delight. His friend repaid the tribute as she cut short her interview in the cage. “I’ve got them scouse lungs in me so I’m ready to punch all night,” McCann said. “I’m so happy … please, please, put it together for … ‘Oh, Paddy the Baddy …’” The crowd joined Meatball Molly in roaring accompaniment to her fellow scouser. On Sunday morning, Paddy the Baddy tweeted: “Woke up in dreamland here 2 of Liverpool’s back 4 tweeting yes Andy lad,” after Andy Robertson and Virgil van Dijk both took to Twitter to celebrate Pimblett’s victory. Images of Wayne Rooney embracing McCann and Pimblett also lit up social media with the “just a couple of kids from Liverpool” tweet matching their love of their home city. It echoed the late-night delirium of Saturday night when backstage, while he devoured a giant pizza, Pimblett confirmed: “It was like fighting in Liverpool. Half of my city is here. We took over London. Wait until we do Anfield, lad. That’s gonna be one special night.” The Paddy and Molly Show seems unstoppable now.",Sport/Sport,Paddy the Baddy and Meatball Molly light up London on thrilling UFC night | Donald McRae,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/20/paddy-pimblett-and-molly-mccann-light-up-london-on-thrilling-night
3/21/2022,"Australian web addresses will soon be shorter with the launch of .au domains, allowing people to drop the .com for the first time. From Thursday, people who can demonstrate they or their business have a connection to Australia will be able to purchase .au domains. It is the first time the .au domain has been available for purchase after auDA, the organisation that manages Australian domains, launched the product after years of consultation. “We heard from more than 97,000 people, the overwhelming majority of whom were in favour of the introduction of short, simple, distinctly local domain names,” the auDA CEO, Rosemary Sinclair, said. Anthony Mayer, the founder of Online is Easy, a company specialising in setting up websites for small businesses, said buying a domain in Australia was much fairer and a “level playing field” for people compared to the “cowboy” areas of buying .com or other domains where people often squat on popular or speculative domains. To have a .com.au you need an ABN, while you need to be a charity or not-for-profit for .org.au. Under the new .au domains, you just need to demonstrate a connection to Australia, but ultimately the domain will still be managed by auDA, meaning people can lodge a complaint if someone tries to buy a domain not relevant to them. “I think it’s really cool that Australia is actually leading the way [with] ethical, open and fair internet,” Mayer said. Businesses that already have a domain under .com.au or a similar site will have priority status to register the corresponding .au website in the six months after the launch. Thousands of sites are reserved from purchase except in limited circumstances, including sites like gov.au, banker.au, olympics.au and others blocked by the legislation governing the use of those names. AuDA has also sought to prevent potential scam sites being set up by reserving sites such as c0m.au, corn.au, and g0v.au.",News/Australia news,Launch of .au domains will allow Australians to drop .com from web addresses,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/21/launch-of-au-domains-will-allow-australians-to-drop-com-from-web-addresses
3/21/2022,"Having kids is a process full of joy and wonder. How do their little brains work? How did I grow a central nervous system? Why is there a spatula in my shower? There are so many things to learn and so much knowledge that seems to be embedded in your bones when caring for children. Some skills and approach to child-rearing comes from a visceral instinct and there are thousands of books and social media accounts that offer advice and doctrines about how to do it right. Everyone warns you about the sleep deprivation, responsibility and the costs; however, no one seems to mention the fun, the stuff your kids will do every day that makes you laugh out loud and the ecstasy of being the preferred parent. But there are a few things that I wish someone had pulled me aside and told me. So let me try and share my hard-earned wisdom. Here are a few things I wish I had known before I became a parent: 1 ) There is no pregnancy glow. If you’re lucky enough to get a short-lived period of dewy skin, nobody will see it because you will be in bed by 7.30pm. Pregnancy is a period of haemorrhoids, dry toast and shit clothes that turn your pelvic floor to jelly. If you didn’t get a real life human being at the end it would be outlawed. To whoever designed this process: 0/10. 2 ) They let you simply walk out of the hospital with a baby and nobody tries to stop you. 3 ) If you’re someone who likes moving freely about, becoming a parent will put this to an end. Leaving the house with kids is a workout and brainteaser. You have to carry mountains of stuff, steer a pram and every cluster of two or more stairs – every escalator, every old building – is suddenly completely inaccessible to you. If you have a pram and are out in public … where are you supposed to wee? This is a serious question. Huge respect to disability activists who fought for buildings that are possible to navigate once you’re on wheels. 4 ) The amount of laundry now required of you is staggering. 5 ) Perpetual terror sets in. I started visualising unlikely gruesome deaths of my kid days after they were born. Going overboard on a cruise ship. A rogue pram accident and a semitrailer. Garotting by mobile phone charger. When I spoke to other parents, they all shared the same thing – a perpetual terror that something terrible would happen to their kids. When you love someone that much and are in charge of protecting them, maybe your brain can’t help but hypothesise all of the gory scenarios. As the years have gone by, I find the terror is easier to live with, but it’s still there. 6 ) Brands see fit to start addressing you as “mama”. I’m begging them to stop. 7 ) Weaning a baby off breastfeeding is the hormonal equivalent to swallowing a year’s worth of the pill. The emotional storm is at full force when you make the call to stop breastfeeding – denying your baby the comfort they want is near impossible. If you stick with it, your body has to transition you back from being a milk truck to a regular civilian.

3/21/2022,"Nobody had reason to pay undue attention to Bronius “Bob” Sredersas after he arrived in Wollongong in 1950, one among thousands of post-war European migrants who helped grow the Illawarra’s Port Kembla steelworks into the biggest in the Commonwealth. Sredersas, 39 when he arrived in Australia aboard the Fairsea liner, initially lived for two years at Unanderra migrant hostel. He then bought a small block and built a house in what was Hoskins Street, Cringila – a humble Wollongong workers’ suburb of unmade roads and fibros in the shadows of the steelworks’ monolithic, ever-exhaling smoke stacks and blast furnaces. The quiet Lithuanian daily walked the couple of hundred metres to the steelworks where he toiled, initially as a labourer and later as a crane driver, until his retirement at 65 in 1975. Sredersas – “Mr Bob” to Cringila locals – kept to himself. He avoided the rowdy, bustling pubs of Port Kembla, nightly jammed with post-shift steelworkers and wharfies for the six o’clock swill. He steered clear of the horses, wasn’t interested in football or cricket. A devout Catholic, he worshipped regularly, tended his cabbages, roses and lemons at the tiny cottage he shared with his cat, Mitzi. On weekends he’d cycle down to Port Kembla harbour to fish and later share his catch with Mitzi. Neighbours and local kids were fond of him. A neighbour of 24 years once recounted: “My two girls loved him. All the local children played in his garden. His pockets were always full of sweets and when a child hurt itself while playing, it would run to Mr Bob for sympathy.” Kind, gentle, avuncular, distinctive in his dark beret and often with pipe or cigarette in mouth, Bob Sredersas was the model citizen – and the ideal migrant success story. People about Cringila would occasionally observe him returning from the station carrying brown paper packages. Without a family to raise and having avoided drinking his earnings, on days off from the steelworks he would catch the old diesel train to Sydney where, from 1956, he attended fine art auctions. Using McCulloch’s Encyclopedia of Australian Art as a guide, he amassed during the next two decades an extraordinary collection of Australian fine visual art, including paintings by Grace Cossington Smith, Arthur Streeton, Margaret Preston, William Ashton, Henry Buckmaster and Norman Lindsay. All available wall space in his cottage was adorned with his remarkable collection. He also owned many ivory pieces and Indigenous works from Papua New Guinea. But after a break-in and the theft of some works, and cognisant that he had nobody to leave the art to, from 1976 he made the benefaction that unavoidably thrust him into the limelight of local and national celebration: he gave the entire collection of some 100 works to the city of Wollongong. Sredersas has since been celebrated by the city and the Australian Lithuanian community, including with special guest lectures and dinners, with a gallery space in his name, a special plaque honouring his generosity, and with several exhibitions. He has been lauded in local and state media, his bequest shorthanded simply as “The Gift”. Sredersas’ philanthropy, upon which the city built a fine art collection and opened the Wollongong Art Gallery (one of regional Australia’s finest) in 1978, earned him an almost mythical status as a cultural hero – the selfless migrant intent on repaying the community that harboured him from war-ravaged Europe. “I have nobody but the people of Wollongong to leave them [the artworks] to. They are for the young people to learn, for old people to enjoy, and for me it’s the realisation of a life’s dedication,” Sredersas said. “It was always my dream to see paintings in a gallery here. When I came to Wollongong there were many factories, buildings and bridges. People before me had built them. But I too can do something for future generations. You must not forget that we are only temporarily in this world but the human race will stay. Something must be done for future generations, future citizens.” But four decades after his death, a more sinister picture of Sredersas’ life is emerging, a life he concealed from those that knew him in Australia. In 2018, former Wollongong councillor Michael Samaras suspected something was not quite right with the Sredersas story and started digging. This summer he uncovered new archival evidence from Lithuania suggesting that during the second world war Sredersas served in the intelligence arm of the Nazi SS, which was instrumental in systematically slaughtering 212,000 Lithuanian Jews. If the evidence can be upheld, should Sredersas’ name be stripped from the regional gallery that built itself on his gift? Should the plaque at the gallery be removed or amended to explain the institution’s most prized collection was donated by an apparent Nazi collaborator and possible war criminal? Is it even possible to distinguish the collection from the man, who in his new life in Australia managed to mystify his war years? The City of Wollongong – and its exceptional art gallery – has much to contemplate. The Gift inevitably brought Bob Sredersas the type of attention he’d always carefully evaded. His almost four decades in Europe – especially his war years – were at best enigmatic. “Bronius Sredersas chose not to talk about his youth, his experiences in the second world war and as a displaced person. He simply preferred to consider that his life began with his arrival in Australia,” reads an essay in a 1989 Wollongong City Gallery (now Wollongong Art Gallery) exhibition catalogue about Sredersas. To mark its 40th anniversary in 2018 the gallery mounted an exhibition, The Gift – Remembering Bob Sredersas. Its catalogue essay tells of a man born to a privileged family in 1910 in Simferopol, on the Crimean peninsula, on 4 December 1910, who grew up in newly independent Lithuania and as a young man worked for the state police in criminal intelligence. The essay continues: “His service record abruptly ends at the time of the [first] Russian occupation … and Bob’s story goes quiet during the second world war; his Australian immigration papers stating that he worked as a farm labourer and emphatically that he did not work as a policeman or soldier. Personal recollections of those who knew Bob in later years in Australia all agree on his reticence to talk about himself and his past, which only adds to the mystery and intrigue surrounding this time in his life.” Mystery and intrigue now seem an understatement amid the emerging evidence about his wartime activities. In a place where perhaps half of the employees in the local industry – especially the steelworks – were “new Australians” who had arrived soon after the war, and the understated Lithuanian always seemed to avoid answering a critical question while alive: what, precisely, did you do in the war, Bob? In death, he was close to beatified, his reputation for beneficence enhanced when he bequeathed his Cringila home to the local Catholic archdiocese “for assisting and educating underprivileged and destitute children”. The Sredersas legacy for modest benevolence, for the virtue of hard work and humility, and for thanking a community that gave him a new life, was irresistible for the town built on steel and the sweat of migrants. “Bob Sredersas’ story is probably the most gentle and beautiful of all the folklore that migrants have established in the steel town,” reads an article in a 1985 special edition magazine celebrating the 100th anniversary of steelworks owner BHP. This folklore became central to Wollongong’s view of itself. The thing about folklore, of course, is that its bedrock is often myth – story. And story often turns out to be quite different to truth and the raw materials of so much sound history: documentary evidence. Testimony to the enduring reverence for the old man is manifest in the Sredersas Gallery in the city’s art gallery. Upstairs in the gallery (elegantly transformed from the city’s former council chambers) a wall plaque celebrates “The Bob Sredersas Gift”. Celebratory dinners were held in his name and occasional historical lectures delivered in his honour (including by Barry Jones and Donald Horne). The local studies section of the Wollongong Library also celebrates Sredersas. Its collection includes three curated boxes of his personal documentation (including birth certificates and migration papers) as well as his prosaic accoutrements – eye glasses and pipe, beret and crucifix. Wollongong attained something like peak Bob Sredersas with the 40th anniversary of the city’s art gallery in 2018. There was a resurgence of media coverage about Sredersas’s life and times, and a special exhibition to honour him. The gallery even elaborately recreated part of his home (replete with Australian masterpieces on the walls and with other brown paper-wrapped works stacked at floor level) in a tribute akin to the Tweed Regional Gallery’s celebration of Margaret Olley’s life and work. An evocative video was produced. It features an actor playing Sredersas speaking of his gift. “I am Bob. Just Bob,” the Sredersas character says. But now it seems that wasn’t true. He was, apparently, much more. That is when 58-year-old Samaras, the son of a Greek immigrant father who worked as an industrial painter at the steelworks, and born and bred in Wollongong, started to become deeply suspicious. “I decided to find out for myself exactly who he really was,” Samaras says. From the time of The Gift, when Michael Samaras was about 12, he lived in a Wollongong reverent of Sredersas. “I read the local paper, the Illawarra Mercury, every day as a kid. So, yes, I knew the story of Sredersas and The Gift intimately – it had been repeated and repeated and repeated. He became such an important figure in the local community and he still is,” says Samaras, a former Labor member of Wollongong council and longtime supporter of the gallery, as we drive about his old town, where his father still lives. We stop outside Sredersas’s old house, paint peeling off its window frames and rust eating the guttering. At the bottom of the street is one of the many gates into the steelworks, its monolithic chimneys belching smoke. Today it employs barely 2,000 people, compared with 22,000 in its heyday when Sredersas was there. We drive out of Sredersas’s old street towards Port Kembla, past thoroughfares named in honour of other proud steel cities: Birmingham Street, Bethlehem Street, Newcastle Street. There is also a Steel Street. We drive through Port Kembla’s heart along Wentworth Street, past those old workers’ pubs that Sredersas avoided so he could buy art instead, past elegant cafes and shops selling clothes and antiques that signal a renaissance in this part of the Illawarra. Samaras says: “They’ve been honouring his benefaction for decades. It’s been in local media repeatedly … His story is part of Wollongong. It’s central to the story of people coming here from Europe, postwar, building new lives, making a community, contributing. You know, all that hard work amid the smoke and pollution, investing his money in art and towards the end of his life leaving a legacy to the city. So, it’s a lovely story and you can see why people have embraced it. It’s the sort of story a city loves to tell itself. But it’s a fairytale. There’s a dark side that needs to be revealed and examined.” We stop along the harbour, where fishermen stand with their rods (as Sredersas once did) on the rocks with their backs to the steelworks: a melange of russet and sable and coal-black metallic horizontals and colliding verticals of conveyors, warehouses, cranes, smoke stacks and walkways. White fumes twist and bellow skywards. “During all that publicity for the 40th anniversary of the gallery,” Samaras says, “there was mention that Sredersas had been a police officer in Lithuania [before the German occupation]. And that’s what made me think, ‘Hang on – I know what the auxiliary police battalions got up to in Lithuania: they murdered the Jews. It was as if an alarm bell went off in my head.” Samaras was especially struck by a local ABC article at the time. It included the thought-provoking lines: “The apparent double life of the Lithuanian migrant, who went from being an intelligence officer in his home country to a steelworker in New South Wales, remains shrouded in mystery 36 years after his death. “Mr Sredersas came from a middle-class family in the northern European country and went on to work as a policeman for the Lithuanian government’s department of security, where he was tasked with monitoring Soviet military activity. His involvement with the civil service ended abruptly in 1940 when the Russians invaded Lithuania, prompting Mr Sredersas to flee, in fear for his life, to Germany.” Samaras went through the archive at the Wollongong Library to confirm, via the translated Russian identity documents, Sredersas’s personal details – including his christening name (Bronislav Schreders), date of birth (4 December 1910), place of birth (Simferopol, Crimea), and his parents’ particulars. Samaras sent these details to the Lithuanian Special Archive in Vilnius together with “Bronius Sredersas”, the (Lithuanian) name on his migration papers for entry to Australia in 1950. Samaras asked for any details about Schreders/Sredersas in Lithuania during the period 1940-44. The Lithuanian archive includes Russian KGB files. The KGB archives, most of which were collated after the Soviet Union reoccupied Lithuania from the Nazis in 1944, have detailed dossiers – based in part on records of interviews with Nazi collaborators and abandoned German records of those who served the Third Reich in implementing anti-Jewish (Holocaust) and anti-Russian policies. It is a long-accepted part of the Sredersas life story that he worked as a policeman in an intelligence unit before the first Soviet occupation. “His safety was at risk as a result of his employment by the Lithuanian security department in monitoring military activity prior to the invasion,” according to the Wollongong City Gallery’s 1989 exhibition catalogue. Sredersas emerges in all the publicity about his life post-The Gift as opaque about his war years. He was vague about whether he’d fled to Germany along with many Lithuanian nationalists after the first Soviet occupation of Lithuania in August 1940, which ended with the Nazi invasion of June-July 1941 – or after the Soviet reoccupation of Lithuania in July 1944. (Having worked for Lithuanian intelligence, he would certainly have been a target.) According again to that exhibition catalogue, Sredersas was apparently “labouring on the riverboats in Kaunas”, Lithuania’s temporary capital, in 1944. Regardless, after the war he was registered as a displaced person, migrated to Australia and lived an unassuming, modest life based on hard work and gratitude towards his adoptive country. A long-time associate of Sredersas reportedly said: “He was wanted at times by the Russians and the Germans, so it’s pretty cloudy as to what his movements were in the war years.” Cloudy indeed. Until, that is, officials at the Lithuanian archives responded to Samaras this summer. The records they produced – an application form, resume and related documents on SS stock – bear the name Bronislaw Shroeders rather than Bronislav Shreders, but the remaining details – date and place of birth and parents’ names – match up with the birth records. “The documents show Sredersas was employed by the SD – Sicherheitsdienst – which was the intelligence agency of the [Nazi] SS [Schutzstaffel]. I also received a copy of his enlistment papers for the SS,” Samaras says. During the German occupation of Lithuania from June 1941 to July 1944 the Nazis – abetted by Lithuanian authorities, including the state’s police services and the SD – killed 96.4% (212,000) of the country’s Jews, most in the latter part of 1941 but also until the Soviet reoccupation in 1944. The Lithuanian police auxiliaries were so effective at shooting Jews en masse that some were deployed to other countries including Ukraine and Belarus to carry out mass killing of Jewish people and to guard concentration camps. Initially Samaras used an online translation tool to interpret the Lithuanian archival documents that implicate Sredersas. To further verify them, he sent the documents to the Simon Wiesenthal Centre’s Efraim Zuroff, the world’s leading “Nazi hunter” who has traced surviving and dead alleged second world war German war criminals to numerous countries, including Australia. Zuroff confirmed to Samaras that the documents show Sredersas worked for the SD and applied to join the SS. They don’t indicate if the application was successful. Zuroff told the Guardian: “In 1943, he was working as a criminal investigator in Kovno [Kaunas] for the SD. By 7 November 1943, he had acquired German citizenship and applied to join the SS as a volunteer. In summation, he was an active participant in enforcing German directives and orders, and most likely was able to join the Waffen-SS, where he very likely participated in Holocaust crimes. “The fact that in 1943, he worked as a criminal investigator for the German Sicherheitsdienst in Kaunas means that he was involved in implementing German policy regarding the Jews, ie the Holocaust. The question is how long did he serve there? If, for example, he already served there in the second half of 1941, when most of the murders of Jews in Lithuania were carried out, then there is no doubt about his involvement in Holocaust crimes.” Zuroff pointed out that the commander of the German SD in Lithuania was “none other than the mass murderer Karl Jäger, author of the infamous Jäger Report, which documented the mass murder of over 137,000 Lithuanian Jews from early July until the end of November 1941”. “Any person who served in the SD in Kaunas almost certainly was involved in the persecution and murder of Jews. If he served there during the period from July 1941 until the end of November 1941, there’s no doubt whatsoever. But even if he only served in that unit later, it’s a reasonable assumption that he was involved in mistreating the Jews,” Zuroff says. “As far as serving in the Waffen-SS, that might have included mistreatment of ‘enemies of the Reich’ as well, but not necessarily. In any event those units were fighting for a victory of the Third Reich, the most genocidal regime in history.” According to Sredersas’ International Refugee Organization papers held at the National Archives of Australia, he was consistently in Lithuania until the Soviet reoccupation in 1944, though from August 1940 he insisted he was largely unemployed (with the exception of six months to June 1944, when he says he was a “seaman”). This is at odds with his apparent application to join the Waffen-SS as a volunteer in November 1943 when he listed his current place of work as “SD” – the intelligence organisation of the SS. In January Samaras alerted the Wollongong Art Gallery’s director, John Monteleone, to the documents about Sredersas and Zuroff’s interpretation of them. There is no suggestion that until the gallery – and then council – received these documents and Zuroff’s assessment that they or anyone else knew of suggestions Sredersas was a member of the SD, had applied to join the SS or could have been involved in anti-Jewish Holocaust activities during the war. Samaras suggested the gallery consult an expert to examine the documents (possibly the Sydney Jewish Museum or Zuroff) and to reconsider its close association with the Sredersas name. “As you know I am a supporter of the Wollongong Art Gallery and understand that this information will come as a shock to many people,” Samaras wrote to Monteleone. “Once you have had time to consider, I suggest we talk again to consider the best way to make this information public, and the next appropriate steps.” The gallery director said he would consult the council, which operates the gallery. A week later a council bureaucrat wrote to Samaras: “Thank you for the information – I understand you are deeply concerned about the gallery’s reputation. On balance, given the lack of clear evidence in this case, it is not deemed appropriate for council – as a local government body – to undertake such an investigative role as suggested. As such, council does not propose to take any further steps in this matter as this time.” On Friday, a council spokesperson said it would not be appropriate for the council to comment on allegations made against a private individual: “Council understands it would be the responsibility of the federal police to investigate such allegations.” In relation to Sredersas’ bequest it said that “standard industry processes were followed for the donation of these artworks. As a result, these artworks were accepted in good faith.” Asked for comment, Monteleone did not personally respond, but the council spokesperson said the council’s response also represented the position of the gallery. Samaras is not satisfied. “I want them to address this properly. That is not going to happen overnight – I know that. They are a public institution and they need to go through a process – a journey. I think they should get a report written perhaps by the Simon Wiesenthal Centre or by the Sydney Jewish Museum that actually explains what happened in Lithuania and puts the documents in context so that the story is properly understood. “They can then engage the community, which knows the Sredersas legend, and say, ‘Well we honoured this man for 46 years but we don’t think it’s appropriate to honour him anymore’. They should change the name of the room from the Sredersas Gallery and take down the plaque that honours him. Then they have to tell the story of who he really was.” Wollongong’s beloved story about its modest philanthropist, its fairytale about the humble migrant who gave back in spades to the city that adopted him from wartorn Europe, has just become a whole lot more complicated. It also potentially imbues The Gift with a sinister dimension, one that was, of course, near impossible to anticipate when Sredersas bequeathed it. “If he thought the gift would soothe his conscience, I hope it didn’t work,” Samaras says, as we sit by the Port Kembla harbour. “I hope he was tormented by nightmares about the children murdered and buried in the forests of Lithuania.”",News/Australia news,‘I am Bob.

3/21/2022,"For almost four years, Suzanna Sheed has started each parliamentary sitting week by moving the same motion. The independent MP for Shepparton, a rural electorate of almost 50,000 people in northern Victoria, asks for a non-government business program to be reinstated in the state’s lower house. Each week, leave to debate Sheed’s motion is refused. But she always brings a speech with her in the hope that, one day, the government will let her speak on the matter. Non-government business refers to the time allocated to backbenchers, opposition members, minor parties and independents. It allows them to introduce their own bills, move motions, demand production of documents by the government and refer an issue for inquiry. Victoria’s legislative assembly is the only lower house in Australia where this doesn’t occur. “It’s created a situation where the lower house is just this sort of odd place where the government dominates,” Sheed tells Guardian Australia. “Our opportunities to do anything significant are terribly limited and we don’t get to hold them to account in the way that they do in the upper house.” Changes to the standing orders made by the Bracks government between 1999 and 2004 effectively eliminated non-government business in Victoria. The leader of the house, Jacinta Allan, says there has been a range of measures introduced to increase the involvement of non-government MPs. “Whether it’s abolishing ‘Dorothy Dixers’, adding supplementary and constituency questions, or e-petitions, we’ve put in a range of measures to ensure more voices in our parliament,” Allan says. “We will continue to look at other ways we can increase this going forward.” But Sheed says the only real opportunities she gets to speak out are under mechanisms shared between government and non-government members. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Sheed’s electorate borders the Murray River. On the other side the river is the New South Wales independent MP for Murray, Helen Dalton. Since she entered parliament in 2019, Dalton – formerly of the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party – has campaigned strongly for the establishment of a public register listing all water owners in the state. She has introduced two private member’s bills on the matter, and is planning a third. “I wouldn’t have achieved as much as what I’ve done if we weren’t able to introduce private members’ bills,” Dalton says. “That’s not saying it’s easy. My first bill lapsed after six months because the government managed to stonewall or delay or filibuster until it lapsed. “But it started a conversation.” Dalton describes the situation in Victoria as “appalling”. “I really do feel for them because there’s a lot of crossbenchers and independents – and we’re going to continue to see more and more of us – so that has to change,” she said. In Victoria’s upper house, Reason party MP Fiona Patten has successfully lobbied the state government to introduce a supervised injecting room in Richmond, the enactment of the nation’s first voluntary assisted dying laws and the decriminalisation of sex work. “Fiona Patten has been able to create so much change, not through her own bill passing but by raising awareness of an issue the government will often pick up,” Sheed says. “Yet in our [lower] house, I represent an electorate of about 45,000 people who vote and there’s a lot of issues that they would like for me to address. It just really disappoints me that we can’t debate some of them.” Non-government MPs in the lower house rarely get the opportunity to debate government bills either. Since 1993, the Legislative Assembly has set a government-business program for each sitting week. When the time falls for completion of the program, debate is interrupted and members are asked to vote on outstanding matters set out in the program. It’s known as the “guillotine”. Ellen Sandell, the Greens MP for Melbourne, says the government has used this to avoid scrutiny on its bills. “It’s incredibly bad for our democracy and pretty poor form from a Labor government to shut down any debate, questions, scrutiny, transparency. It happens every single Thursday,” Sandell says. “The crossbenchers and opposition often will ask, on specific bills, if we can just do the proper deep dive . And they always say no.” Not one bill has gone to consideration in detail in this parliamentary term, meaning MPs have not been able to move amendments on a bill or debate its clauses in detail. Sheed says it is “incredibly frustrating” MPs were unable to put questions to the health minister, Martin Foley, during debate on the pandemic legislation last year. The opposition’s spokesperson for government scrutiny, Louise Staley, agrees. “All the main ministers are in the lower house – the health minister, the treasurer, the transport infrastructure minister, the premier – and we’re in a situation where we cannot put questions to them on legislation,” she says. “It’s not something that we would do all the time, on each and every bill, but some are incredibly important. “It’s an issue that goes to the very heart of democracy.” The Centre for Public Integrity has released a discussion paper titled “Scrutiny shortcomings: Victoria”, which raises concerns about the government businesses program and lack of non-government business in the lower house, along with the rules relating to the establishment of joint investigatory committees. “These deficiencies gravely impair the ability of the parliament to perform its constitutional role, and should be addressed as a matter of priority,” it says. The thinktank said the weakness of Victoria’s parliamentary scrutiny system was exposed by the Covid-19 response throughout 2020 and 2021, when the government failed to table health directions in parliament. The Labor-led Scrutiny of Acts and Regulations Committee found it had no power to review the directions as they weren’t tabled in parliament. Both Sheed and Sandell have raised their concerns with the government but believe there is no appetite for change. “There’s a sense in which I think neither party wants it because they like it when they’re in government having this amount of power and not having to put up with all the ‘nonsense’,” Sheed says. “Look at the upper house – it’s hard work for the government. But you know, we got a much better pandemic bill out of it, so that’s democracy at work.” Sandell says even those who support the Labor government should be worried. “These things have been eroded under a Labor government, but it could be a very rightwing government that comes in next, and they’ll take advantage of all these things that have been eroded,” she says. Opposition leader Matthew Guy says he would be happy to bring back non-government business if elected at the 26 November poll. “Every member of parliament, whether they’re Liberal, Labor, National, independent or Green, they have a right to raise issues and have them debated for a period of time in the parliament. Because that’s what the parliament exists for,” he says.",News/Australia news,"Inside Victoria’s lower house, where non-government business isn’t allowed",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/21/inside-victorias-lower-house-where-non-government-business-isnt-allowed
3/21/2022,"Fifty-one asylum seekers who were brought to Australia for medical treatment continue to languish in detention in Australia, including 18 in the Park hotel in Melbourne, with no indication of when they might be released, according to a prominent refugee support group. Their ongoing detention comes despite a string of recent releases, including high-profile campaigner and Iranian refugee Mehdi Ali, who was allowed to resettle in the US two weeks ago. Last week a group of nine men were allowed to leave the Park hotel, located in the inner Melbourne suburb of Carlton, and eight will now wait in the community while they organise to leave Australia. Their freedom has advocates questioning the seemingly “random” way some of the refugees are allowed to leave, while others are left indefinitely detained. It is very hard to get accurate numbers on the number of people still detained under the medevac laws, but figures provided by the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre show about 206 people have been released – to other countries or allowed to live on bridging visas in the community. No one is sure why some are granted freedom and others still languish inside. Of the 51 people left in detention, most of them are men – there is only one woman. They come from a broad range of countries: Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Iran. Some came to Australia when they were teenagers and have now spent almost nine years locked up. All of them have been deemed by the government to pose no security threat. While the government won’t ever provide the exact number of people stuck in detention, the ASRC director of advocacy and campaigns, Jana Favero, said since 2017 around 206 have been released and they have not been able to determine why. “Of those, some have gone to the US, some are waiting to go to the US but the majority are in the community,” Favero said. “There is no common thread between those who are in detention and those who are in the community. “The fact that the government have released 206 and left 51 in there shows it’s a form of cruelty.” They are not allowed to resettle permanently in Australia but other counties including the US, Canada and New Zealand have offered to take them, Favero said. “While everyone who is still in detention is thrilled for their brothers when they get released, it compounds the situation that they’ve been left behind,” she said. The minister for home affairs, Karen Andrews, was asked at a recent Senate estimates hearing why the refugees were still stuck in the hotel when they pose no risk. She said some had not been released because of character or health reasons. Andrews said the Coalition government, which has been in power since 2013, was still dealing with the backlog from Labor. “What we have committed to as a government is to work to make sure that as many of those people are resettled as we can possibly manage in the shortest possible amount of time,” Andrews said. After fleeing Iran, Hossein Latifi came on a boat to Australia in 2013. He said the majority on board were released into the community, while he was sent to Nauru with a handful of others. He is still in contact with his friends who have spent the last seven years living in the community. “We came at the same time,” Latifi said, who has spent the last six months in the Park hotel. There is no fresh air, no gym to exercise in, and many of them have insomnia so they sleep during the day. He passes the time watching people outside his window and listening to songs. “I listen to songs, but I get tired of even that. Mentally we are sick. It’s unbelievable to stay in this situation for a long time. “If you live in the community you have more opportunity, you can study and go to the gym, you can have a coffee with a friend or lunch or dinner. Here, your life is dead. Nothing.” Sometimes campaigner Tom Hardman calls him. Hardman goes down every Friday night to photograph someone new in a cage outside the hotel. They’ve had the big names of human rights activism: Craig Foster, Adam Bandt and Tim Costello. Hardman says it’s sometimes hard to speak to the men stuck inside. “I try to keep in regular contact, but it’s hard to know what to say. What do you say to someone who has had everything stripped away from them?” Alison Battisson, a lawyer and the CEO of Human Rights for All, has helped three men leave Australia in the last year, including Ali. They were all children when they arrived in the country, she said. “But the government deemed it appropriate to detain them and charge the taxpayer $10m, which could be good to give to nurses, or the SES or in fact anyone else. “Instead of the Park hotel, Serco, they are private companies, some individuals are getting hugely rich from abusing human rights.” She said it’s hard to get people out, but it can be done. The government fights them every step of the way. “We have identified safe third countries, and the government is fighting us on it. We’re in court, it’s the ultimate pushback.” Salah Abdul Kareem fled Iraq with his son in 2013. He had worked with the US army in Afghanistan and says the Taliban were threatening him with his life. “The situation was very bad. I had worked with the American army, my last job was in the ministry of oil, the terrorists killed my brother in 2007.” Abdul Kareem left his wife and younger son, thinking he would make the journey and they could join him later. He has been in detention ever since. “I’m very tired. I’ve lost family. My son, he was 14 years old when we left, he’s 24 now. He has gone without schools and education.” The pair recently spent six months in the Park hotel, before they were moved to the Melbourne Immigration Transit Accommodation in Broadmeadows. “What can I say? For my wife, nine years, we don’t have anything except waiting. Some people were waiting for one month. I’ve lost nine years. About me no problem, but my son he’s young.”",News/Australia news,‘A form of cruelty’: 51 asylum seekers brought to Australia under medevac laws still languish in detention ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/21/a-form-of-cruelty-51-asylum-seekers-brought-to-australia-under-medevac-laws-still-languish-in-detention
3/21/2022,"Soaring commodity prices and a shrinking jobless rate will combine to slice almost $90bn from projected federal budget deficits out to 2024-25, although excessive pre-election promises would undermine the government’s fiscal repair efforts, according to Chris Richardson, a senior economist at Deloitte. The predicted improvement compares with forecasts in the government’s mid-year outlook (Myefo) released last December. The current year’s deficit alone will be cut almost a third from a projected $99.2bn to $69bn as the economy’s rebound from Covid disruptions quickens, Richardson said. The falling unemployment rate – now at its lowest since 2008 – is helping to lift tax revenues and reduce welfare payments. However, about half of the improvement in the budget outlook stems from the commodity price surge, further increased by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions. “The world is giving us a stunning pay rise,” Richardson said. “It’s not just that we have recovered faster and better than expected – it’s that the world is handing us money at a rate we’ve never seen before.” Deloitte predicts the deficits out to 2024-25 will be $87.6bn smaller than the Myefo forecasts. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, who will present his fourth budget on 29 March, said on Friday “the time for large-scale economic stimulus is behind us”, and that “fiscal settings need to be normalised” as part of the government’s fiscal strategy. A looming election, though, meant a rising risk of extravagant spending, particularly by a government that was trailing badly in the polls, as the Morrison government is. “It’s a danger period, as we know from history,” Richardson said, citing promises by the Howard government for big tax cuts in 2007 and the Rudd government’s national disability insurance scheme in 2013, that had long-lasting budget effects. “We don’t seem to be looking at something as big as either of those past experiences, but it’s certainly risky,” he said. Any normalisation of finances should include dropping the low and middle income tax offset (LMITO) that was meant as a temporary relief and has now doubled to $1080 a year for those eligible. Dubbed “lamington” for its LMITO acronym, the $8bn offset is scheduled to end in June unless extended, although the government may be wary of scrapping it before the election. The benefits, though, amount to “middle-class welfare” as it excludes the half of Australia’s adult population that doesn’t pay income taxes, such as retirees, students or those on salaries too low to pay personal tax, Richardson said. Modelling by Deloitte also indicates the injection of $8bn in the present economic state would trigger action by the Reserve Bank to quell the inflationary consequences, requiring an increase in the cash rate of 0.3 percentage points. The cash rate is currently at a record low 0.1% with the central bank now saying a rate rise this year is “plausible” as inflationary pressures mount. Investors and some banks predict a move by July or sooner. Longer term, Deloitte expects the government will spend more than currently forecast for areas such as social service, the NDIS and defence. To meet those costs, “you’ve got to save out of the budget something like 2% of national income a year, or about $40bn”, Richardson said. “The economics of it is entirely doable, the politics of it is entirely disastrous.” Frydenberg said the Deloitte forecast was “a further vote of confidence in Australia’s economic resilience, noting ‘Australia’s economy is booming’”. “Australia’s economy has outperformed all major advanced economies since the pandemic began in both employment and output terms with our recovery stronger than that seen in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan,” he said. Jim Chalmer, Labor’s shadow treasurer and Katy Gallagher, the shadow finance minister, welcomed the predicted deficit narrowing, but said the government “won’t take responsibility for a trillion dollars in debt or falling real wages”. “The Coalition is showing all the signs of yet another budget full of secret slush funds before the election and secret cuts after it,” they said in a statement. PwC Australia, another consultancy, also expects Frydenberg will reveal a smaller deficit for the 2021-22 fiscal year than projected, coming in at $80bn. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Chief economist, Jeremy Thorpe, said: “[The] Australian economy has been remarkably resilient and deficit projections since the onset of Covid-19 have proven to be overly pessimistic as the labour market has remained strong, reducing the need for unemployment support, and increasing tax revenues.” The recent floods in Queensland and New South Wales will be one budgetary drag, and the war in Ukraine would fan inflation risks. The latter was “not necessarily a terrible outcome from the budgetary perspective, ironically, because inflation means higher prices, and that means there’s more revenue”, he said. So far, the major political parties have avoided major spending commitments, at least compared with the same stage ahead of the 2019 election. “This is not a time to be over-stimulating the economy,” Thorpe said. “The economy’s been humming along quite nicely, and inflation is a growing issue and a growing risk.” Thorpe shared Richardson’s view that it was “hard to believe in an election year” the government would dump the LMITO despite it originally being meant to be temporary. “Pensions, disability support, rental assistance – there’s a range of mechanisms that you might start to think of, if you’re really trying to target the most vulnerable,” he said.To prepare for the future, when prices for commodities such as iron ore and coal drop, the government should use the budget to prepare the economy for the next generation of industries. “How do we support green, cheap hydrogen or solar, … or extracting critical minerals and leveraging that into battery technology, rather than iron ore and coal?” Thorpe said. “We can’t rely on what we’ve done over the past 10 years to sustain a high level of growth going forward.”",News/Business,‘Stunning pay rise’: commodity boom to fuel improved Australian budget,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/21/stunning-pay-rise-commodity-boom-to-fuel-improved-australian-budget
3/21/2022,"It was Sunday evening and Cheree Toka, then 26, was “freaking out”. The next morning, Toka was due on the ABC Breakfast couch to explain to the nation why she was submerging the NSW government in hot water with her campaign to fly the Aboriginal flag permanently atop the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The idea was born in a car after a dinner out. “I looked up as we were driving over the bridge and saw the Aboriginal flag wasn’t there – just the NSW and Australian flags,” Toka tells Guardian Australia five years later. “I remember getting riled and saying to my friends ‘this country is so messed up sometimes’.” So the young Kamilaroi woman started researching. She discovered the Aboriginal flag was flown atop the world-famous bridge just 19 days a year. “That didn’t sit well with me, so I started a Change.org petition.” That was in January 2017 and the campaign found traction almost immediately. Suddenly journalists wanted to know this young Aboriginal woman who was lighting up social media. National television, though, was a dizzying step up. “I’m almost reluctant to admit this, but I hadn’t even voted at that point in my life,” Toka recalls. “I’d just never delved into what the political parties stood for. I really had no idea! “I was panicking, and very nervous. Public speaking had never been my thing.” Anxious and overwhelmed, Toka reluctantly cancelled the ABC interview. “It was frustrating because I expected so much more from myself,” she says. “I didn’t realise then that people just wanted to hear my passion for this issue.” Toka’s experience is a hallmark of our digital age, where everyday people can be empowered to start all manner of campaigns. Some even manage to go “viral”. But change rarely comes easily, and advocates can find themselves thrust into the spotlight before they’re ready to handle it. If she was surprised by the campaign’s initial popularity, she was even more surprised by the battle that was to come. “I thought it was such an easy ask,” she says. “I had no idea it’d take five years of relentless campaigning.” Ironically, it was another media interview that steeled Toka for the fight ahead. It was February 2018 and she’d just finished doing a photo call with the then NSW Labor leader Luke Foley, who had announced his party’s support for her campaign. What should have been a day to celebrate quickly became anything but when Foley faced then 2GB radio host Alan Jones. The conservative firebrand excoriated Foley for pledging to fly the Aboriginal flag permanently atop the bridge. “That is the most divisive thing I’ve heard from a political leader of any kind. I’m sorry, you’ve lost the electorate and you’ve lost me,’’ Jones said. He wasn’t finished there, telling Foley he had no hope of winning the state election the following year. “They will thrash you Luke, you’re gone.” What Jones couldn’t know was that his opprobrium was a tipping point for Toka, providing the motivation to keep fighting. “I didn’t care what Alan Jones had to say,” Toka says. “He doesn’t support or represent me or my people. “Despite the backlash, racism and setbacks, this man hadn’t affected me, as earlier criticism had. That’s when I knew – I will absolutely see this through.” From that point on, when faced with self doubt, Toka listened to three things: “My gut, my heart, and my friends who said ‘you have fire in your belly – now let it blaze!”. Speak to Toka now and there’s a sense she’s become – not cynical but shrewd. “I was naive,” she says of her early years of campaigning. She heard many reasons why the flag couldn’t be flown permanently: first it was flag protocol. Then it was needing to prove there was community support. Then it was the problem of erecting new poles. Then it was the cost of doing that. “At first I complied with everything they asked,” Toka says. She amassed 177,000 signatures on her Change.org petition. She sought publicity by doing the BridgeClimb “even though I’m terrified of heights”. She collected 10,000 paper signatures, which compelled a NSW parliamentary debate. She faced her reluctance of speaking to media and politicians. She even started a GoFundMe to raise tens of thousands of dollars towards the quoted $300,000 cost of erecting new flagpoles. She now realises what was happening. “Excuses,” she says. “They just wanted me to shut up and go away. As I grew in confidence and sharpened my communication skills, that was never going to happen.” On the weekend of 5 February, the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, promised to fly the flag permanently on the bridge within six months to a year. Brilliant and overdue news that the Aboriginal Flag will fly year round on the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Congrats to @Chereetoka, an incredible activist and Grayndler local, who led the 5 year campaign to get this done. pic.twitter.com/1HGmerAMWF The announcement has left Toka feeling cautiously elated. She’s keen to meet with Perrottet after his predecessor as premier, Gladys Berejiklian, consistently ignored her campaign. “I’d love to sit opposite Perrottet, hear him commit to a six-month deadline,” she says. “I also want to hear how it’ll be done; it needs to be done respectfully and ceremoniously, and with Indigenous people at the heart.” Toka, now 31, admits she’s matured a lot while pursuing her campaign. She’s now savvy about making change, something she’d love to do more of in the future, particularly with Indigenous education in schools. When asked what she’s learned along the way, Toka says change doesn’t happen overnight. “You have to have patience. And you have to make friends, even when you don’t want to.” This.Two things.Very cool.About time. https://t.co/oTE9Pb2JVY The patience extends to her own political ambitions, having been invited to put her name forward for a spot on Labor’s ticket at the Inner West council elections, which she politely declined. “I’m not ready yet,” she says. “Give it a few years.” So how will she feel as that Aboriginal flag finally ascends the pole to take its permanent place atop one of Australia’s most famous landmarks? “I’m going to feel like we did it. I helped make that happen. I’m going to feel a sense of belonging and power,” she says. “And I’ll feel equal to non-Indigenous people.”",News/Australia news,‘Fire in your belly’: how Cheree Toka went from non-voter to political change agent,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/21/fire-in-your-belly-how-cheree-toka-went-from-non-voter-to-political-change-agent
3/21/2022,"There has been much excitement and buzz around the AFLW the past week, and for all the right reasons. The finals kicked off at Arden Street on Saturday when North Melbourne hosted embattled Fremantle in the first of the qualifiers. In something of an upset, the Dockers’ 38-point win hinted at their true potential when blessed with a full composite, with outstanding performances by captain Hayley Miller, and W champion, Kiara Bowers, who is virtually unstoppable when fully fit. The win sets up an exciting preliminary-final battle against minor premiers Adelaide, who will be rearing to go after a two-week break. In other positive news, Essendon announced Natalie Wood would be senior coach for their AFLW team, joining Bec Goddard at Hawthorn as the second of only two female senior coaches currently in that role across the competition. Wood is a highly regarded figure in women’s footy, and her appointment is testament to exceptional talent and hard work. The decision has been universally applauded. These are the topics which should be dominating the sporting conversation right now. However, the media has instead been consumed with the fallout from a video of a prominent Fox Sports journalist, Tom Morris, allegedly using sexist and homophobic slurs in a WhatsApp chat to describe a female colleague. Morris was swiftly sacked by Fox following an investigation and has since publicly apologised. Given these developments, it is tempting for some to assume this was a one-off, that it is time to move on. Those people are not likely to be women in sports media. Or, I would wager, women anywhere. Because here is the thing: while the public show of support for Tom Morris over his stoush with Luke Beveridge was resounding and prolific by the media across the board, the response by those same journalists in support of their female colleague has been depressingly but predictably limited almost entirely to women. This is not our first rodeo. Seven years ago another female journalist, Caroline Wilson, was the victim of a humiliating and misogynistic attack by colleague, Eddie McGuire, also in absentia, also without provocation, and also without suffering critique or judgment until it was called out by a group of women, with the support of a handful of standout allies. Not surprisingly, many of those same men have been among the minority to use their platforms to call out the appalling treatment of a female colleague this time, too. Among them are Andy Maher, Andrew Stafford, Francis Awaritefe, Richard Hinds, Brandon Jack and Craig Foster. These are all men who have received abuse and criticism for sticking their necks out, much like the women they have been supporting. Which might also tell us why there have been so few of them. We can take heart from Fox Sports’ swift and decisive sanctions in 2022. Similarly, there has been a noted increase in the number of women working in sports media (although, importantly, this does not address the lack of diversity along racial, cultural, gender, sexuality or disability lines). There has been the embracing of excellent programs, such as Change the Game and Making the Call, which are creating sports media opportunities for the many over-qualified but under-supported women struggling to break in. However, there is a long way to go. And the work to change culture should not be left to women alone, a point eloquently made by Kelli Underwood, in what was effectively a call to action from her missing colleagues. But let’s not kid ourselves that this is an issue unique to sports media, or even the media more broadly. Pick a male-dominated institution or industry and women are being told – sometimes discretely, sometimes quietly, sometimes overtly – that we are not welcome. And the message, one way or another, is largely coming from men. A recent global report into sexist attitudes reminded us that Australian men hold the most sexist attitudes in the western world. When we add in race, disability, sexuality and gender queerness, the numbers explode. This is not just an issue of fairness, either. According to Our Watch, ‘violence against women arises in the social context of gender inequality, and that this violence has distinct gendered drivers’. Fairness and equality are reasonable and rightful goals. The many other dangers which arise when society is not equal, fair or just, remind us that these goals are not just nice to have but are, in fact, urgent. Reactions among women in sports media this week have ranged from shock, anger, hurt and frustration to sheer exhaustion. What is different is there is a sense that this is a moment in time we will not let pass. Not without a fight. Women in sports media are exhausted. But so are women everywhere. We’re sick of carrying the emotional and psychological load of having to fight for the right to feel safe – at work, at home, at the football, at our political institutions – a right that most men can take for granted. It is well beyond time for men to speak up – before these conversations become media fodder. It is time for men to step up and shoulder the load because, quite frankly, it is their problem as much as it is ours.",Sport/Sport,"Women in sports media are exhausted, it is well beyond time for men to speak up | Nicole Hayes",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/21/women-in-sports-media-are-exhausted-it-is-well-beyond-time-for-men-to-speak-up
3/21/2022,"With 150 Bluey episodes now available on ABC iView for those in Australia and slightly fewer available on Disney+ for those in other, less Blueified countries, it can be hard to know where to start with this much-loved cartoon about a little blue heeler dog and her family – and then where to start again, and again, and again. Here are my 10 favourites: It’s never specified that the cake in question is being made from the Australian Women’s Weekly Children’s Birthday Cake Book – but let’s be honest, it is. And this episode isn’t really about Bluey and her dad Bandit making her little sister Bingo’s birthday cake; it’s about doing things that aren’t fun because they have, in Bluey lingo, gotta be done. As Bluey learns the satisfaction that comes with completing tasks, parents will experience the horrified thrill of recognition over the bits of Lego strewn about the Heeler lounge room – a moment of valuable relatabilty in a house that’s otherwise far nicer than most of us will ever see. It’s also thoughtfully provided a generation of frustrated parents with a perfect ersatz swear when things get too difficult: “Oh, duck cake!” Why not try it in front of your own children six or seven thousand times? With barely any dialogue and some of the most gorgeous sound design and animation in the series so far, Rain has Bluey playing a very familiar game of trying to block a stream of water pouring down her front path. It’s incredibly simple, but powerfully evocative: not only for how it captures those dark daytime storms familiar to anyone who’s spent any time in Queensland, but also in the way that Bluey’s mum Chilli gradually abandons her attempts to stay dry and embraces playing with her daughter. If you want a single episode that sums up the overarching philosophy of Bluey, it’s hard to think of a better example. Some episodes of Bluey inspire fear in parents because they represent a new standard that children then expect in their own lives. Seriously, the tooth fairy rate mentioned in the episode Markets: five dollarbucks per lost tooth? Who even has physical paper money lying around the house these days? Anyway, Dance Mode goes one step further, by conditioning children to expect their parents to dance in public on demand – which both Chilli and Bandit do with gusto, if not exactly willing enthusiasm. In any case, this episode about how sometimes we say yes when we really want to say no involves a lot of public down-getting as it makes its way to its triumphant conclusion. It also contains a busker who isn’t playing Leonard Cohen’s Hallelujah, another refreshing break from reality. Bluey meets visiting French-speaking Jean-Luc while on a family camping trip and the language barrier doesn’t stop them developing a firm friendship until he abruptly leaves without being able to tell her that he’s leaving and no I’m not crying, you’re crying. It’s a simple and beautiful lesson about embracing moments of joy as and when they arrive in our lives, even though – spoiler – teen Bluey and teen Jean-Luc meet again years later and he now speaks English and oh god why can’t all loves be this perfect and pure? This recent episode lit the socials up with the ire of a billion furious parents, who did not appreciate having their kids party traditions critiqued. The Heelers’ next door neighbour Pat the Dog, AKA Lucky’s dad, doesn’t hold with this everyone-gets-a-prize business, calling for a game of pass the parcel that adheres to old school rules: one big prize in the middle, instead of one in every layer. Chaos, predictably, ensues; lessons are learned, parcels are passed, and Australia escapes becoming, as Pat puts it, “a nation of squibs”. While the ending seems to wildly overestimate the enthusiasm of children who are not getting toys, it does involve Pat enraptured by an absolutely killer bit of 80s AOR rock, complete with bitchin’ guitarmonies. GUITARMONIES! Chilli and Aunt Trixie (the always brilliant Myf Warhurst, whose “Go and destroy the planet somewhere else!” is the best line delivery of the episode and possibly any episode of anything) settle back with drinks, while Bandit, Uncle Stripe and Pat dig up stumps from the yard. This thrilling display of masculinity is not remotely undercut by Bluey, Bingo and Muffin giving the three men makeovers as a condition of letting them pull up a stump they’re using as a beauty parlour. This episode is especially glorious for the way it captures the way in which men interact with one another: mainly through paying one another out in between some unexpectedly real conversations (at one point, as Bandit strains over a crowbar, you overhear Stripe reassuring Pat over something he’s going through). As Chilli explains to Bluey, this is how grown-ups play; any right-thinking dad should charge out to the backyard with his mates and an axe, yelling “STUMPFEST!” Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning In another episode that captures an ultra-specific moment in Australian childhood, Bandit take the girls and their friend Mackenzie to the park, but when the kids get bored he decides that it’s time to head down to the creek instead. Leeches, yabbies, dragonflies, tadpoles, and even a pademelon turns up as Bluey overcomes her aversion to the grubby, sticky outdoors and discovers that the bush is a beautiful place to be. As the kids learn the joys of spending time in nature, I heard echoes of my own father when Bandit warns the girls about dropbears: “I’m joking. But seriously, watch out for snakes.” Chilli and Bandit build an Ikea-style outdoor swing-seat, while the girls play with the packaging and in doing so literally recreate the entire development of life. You know, the sort of thing that no other show would even think of doing. It’s impossible to watch this episode and not see it as creator-writer Joe Brumm’s spiritual-scientific manifesto: Bluey and Bingo start as mother and baby fish and then proceed through reptiles, dinosaurs, mammals and even cavedogs until finally an all-grown-up Bingo takes the now elderly Bluey to explore space. Extra points for the most meta line in the show, as Bandit scoffs at the Ikea-style illustrated instructions: “I’m not taking advice from a cartoon dog.” Harsh, Bandit. AKA The One With Baby Bluey. Chilli remembers her first-time-parent anxieties as infant Bluey lags behind other kids in their mothers and babies group, with Chilli determined to get Bluey walking. From a condescending paediatrician dismissing Chilli’s concerns, down to Bandit’s mum deciding to put oil on Bluey’s knees to force her to walk (Bandit: “This isn’t legal any more!”), this episode is both wise and hilarious. But the moment where an older, more experienced mother (voiced by Leigh Sales, no less) reassures Chilli with the one lesson she’s learned from having “eight – no, nine!” kids is that all mums just need to hear that they’re actually doing great, is another of the series’ big waterworks moments. In years to come, this Bluey episode will be used by humankind to test if someone is actually a replicant. If you’re not struggling to suppress choking sobs by the time Bingo tells the Sun that she has to go now because she’s a big girl, then we’ll deploy the Blade Runners. This is a thoughtful, beautiful meditation on the people in our family orbit. A dreaming Bingo and her toy rabbit, Floppy, drift through the solar system, while back in the Heeler household Bandit and Chilli have a night of interrupted sleep familiar to every parent of young children. Aside from anything else, it just looks gorgeous. Jupiter is a sloshing fluid world, intercut with the sleeping girls merrily kicking Bandit in the belly. Saturn is surrounded by swirling rings of bunnies, calling to Floppy to join them. And the Sun is the warm and comforting voice of Chilli, telling her daughter that she is always there and always loves her. It’s an entire scope of the cosmos, poured into one typical night.

3/21/2022,"When Sydney resident Evelyn Bratchford’s housemate tested positive for Covid this week, she was away at her boyfriend’s house. Unwilling to return home and risk being exposed, she says: “Now I feel like a little lost egg. “I turned up at my friend’s house last night with a small bag of things from the suitcase in the back of my car and my pillow.”Screening potential flatmates is always a risky business, even without the added pressure of a pandemic. Since restrictions eased in Sydney late last year, Bratchford has had to hunt for both a new house and a new flatmate, making her well-accustomed to the challenges. Bratchford lives with two other people, and in the last few months has felt quite relaxed about her home’s Covid protocols. But in the lead-up to Christmas, the whole household resolved to shield together. “I wanted to be able to go away, and I was really conscious of what I was doing, as were my housemates,” she says. “We were all really aware that in the weeks before Christmas, we just wanted to settle down, because cases were going off the rails.” While Bratchford is lucky to have like-minded housemates, Jemima Mowbray, policy and advocacy manager at the Tenants’ Union of New South Wales, says questions about what kinds of risk people are comfortable with have become essential in recent months. “In lockdown, there were clear restrictions in place. But now you have to make your own decisions and there is a whole lot more to negotiate,” says Mowbray. “People want to have a friendly conversation, and it might be easy to get along with someone, but you need to establish the ground rules, how you live and what you are comfortable with … Covid makes that really clear.” Navigating these conversations can be uncomfortable, and asymmetrical attitudes about what safe socialising looks like can easily fuel household tensions. Bratchford acknowledges it can be hard to tell where new flatmates stand, especially when you don’t know them that well. When looking for a new housemate, Bratchford’s household advertised themselves as fully vaccinated after noticing a lot of sharehouse ads included this information. Claudia Conley, community manager at Flatmates.com.au, says: “We have seen a lot of members actively offering their vaccination status on a listing. A large number of property listings are advertising that they want a fully vaccinated and Covid-safe home.” Conley also says the website’s support services have seen an uptick in members asking if they can screen potential candidates based on vaccination status. But with rent due and bills to pay, the pressure to fill a room can lessen the importance of Covid safety. That is the case for Brisbane-based university student Hugo, who is currently looking for a housemate. He reflects that he probably should be asking potential flatmates about their attitudes to Covid-19, but says: “I don’t want to put people off. “At the end of the day, we need someone to take the room, and if they’re a nice person, that’s good enough for us.” Sydney-based student Emilia Roux is in a similar situation as she seeks to move out of home for the first time. “Having someone on the same page as you about Covid is a good thing, but it’s not a dealbreaker,” she says. “It is hard to be picky at the moment given there are less international students and people moving out of home, so it is already difficult to find people without the added pressure of Covid precautions.” She’s taken a subtle approach. “Mostly I think it is about observing someone and picking up on their cues to see if they’re on the same wavelength. For example, do they wear a mask?” Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Mowbray thinks broader housing pressures have resulted in sacrifices being made. “I suspect there have been big clashes, where people have moved out and found different accommodation,” she says. “But on the other hand, you can find yourself in a situation where you need housing and staying put is the only option for you.” Bratchford and her household did have conversations about how to manage Covid should they need to isolate from each other within their home. “We talked about it a lot and we were never able to decide what we would do in that situation. “We would joke about getting that dreaded video call from somebody’s room after they did a test and got the result, and we didn’t have a plan.” The dreaded call came, and Bratchford resolved to stay at a friend’s place while her flatmate recuperates. Their other flatmate, who has both had Covid and isolated as a household contact previously, also chose to leave. But the question still remains, Bratchford says: “What are we going to do if next month I get Covid?”",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘There is a whole lot more to negotiate’: how Covid-19 has changed housemate hunting,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/21/there-is-a-whole-lot-more-to-negotiate-how-covid-19-has-changed-housemate-hunting
3/21/2022,"Teachers at Brisbane religious school Citipointe Christian College are being asked to sign employment contracts that warn they could be sacked for being openly homosexual. The school says the wording of staff employment conditions is “under review” but one former teacher, who refused to sign the document last month, says he has now effectively lost his job for taking a stand. While religious bodies are allowed to discriminate in limited circumstances under Queensland law, critics have questioned the legality of the contracts. Citipointe’s principal, pastor Brian Mulheran, stood aside last month after the school abandoned attempts to institute “discriminatory” enrolment contracts for students. The enrolment contracts asked families to sign a statement of faith that implied transgender students would only be recognised by their “biological sex”, and which described homosexual acts as “immoral” and “offensive to God”. The student contracts were ultimately withdrawn by the school after significant criticism and backlash. The school then apologised to students who felt “they would be discriminated against” and said that the school needed “time to heal”. “I hope that by withdrawing the contract we can return all our focus to the Christian education of our students,” Mulheran said at the time. Guardian Australia has now obtained a copy of the school’s conditions of employment, which are part of each new teacher’s workplace contract. The specific contract offer is dated in February – after the school’s apologies and withdrawal of the student enrolment contracts – and is signed by the new acting principal, Ruth Gravestein. The document requires teachers to work within the same statement of faith of the International Network of Churches, the umbrella group that ultimately controls the Citipointe megachurch and school. “It is a genuine occupational requirement of the college that the employee not act in a way he knows, or ought reasonably to know, is contrary to the religious beliefs of the college,” the document says. “Nothing in his/her deliberate conduct should be incompatible with the intrinsic character of their position, especially, but not only, in relation to the expression of human sexuality through heterosexual, monogamous relationships, expressed intimately through marriage. “Your failure to abide by such requirements expressed in the above clauses could constitute a breach of your employment contract and subsequent dismissal.” The use of the term “genuine occupational requirement” in the employment conditions is an apparent attempt to mimic the wording of section 25 of the Queensland anti-discrimination act, which allows for religious bodies to discriminate in circumstances where a person “openly acts in a way that the person knows or ought reasonably to know is contrary to the employer’s religious beliefs”. Lawyers say that, regardless, the “sexuality” clause in the Citipointe contract is problematic. “My legal opinion is that this contract is likely to be found unlawful under Queensland anti-discrimination laws,” said Matilda Alexander from the LGBTI legal service. “It seeks to prohibit conduct that is not in connection with the workplace by stopping an employee acting in a way that is contrary to the religious beliefs of the college, whether or not this is done openly. “It changes the ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ mantra to ‘don’t do it’. “This is far beyond the power of any employer in Queensland. We all have the right to attend work and pursue our own personal lives outside of work, even if working for a religious school.” One former teacher, who refused to sign the contract, said Citipointe was an “encouraging and supportive learning environment, with good facilities and hard-working staff”. “Not signing this contract was my choice, but I have effectively lost my job to discrimination,” he said. “Excluding LGBTQIA+ people from the school community perpetuates these archaic values, and doesn’t prepare students for the real world. In the real world if you don’t share values with a colleague or friend you can’t contract them out of your life. “I’m disgusted by this kind of intolerance and discrimination hiding behind the name of God, especially when formalised in a contract. This is not Christianity.” The Queensland attorney general, Shannon Fentiman, said Queensland’s anti-discrimination laws were robust and urged anyone who believed they had been discriminated against in the workplace to make a complaint to the state Human Rights Commission. “It is absolutely appalling to see these awful and damaging clauses in the employment contracts for Citipointe College teachers – especially after the recent outrage and controversy around their student enrolment forms.” The Independent Education Union’s Queensland and Northern Territory branch, which represents teachers at Citipointe, said a “state of being” was not sufficient basis for an employer to apply a “genuine occupational requirement” exemption to anti-discrimination laws. The union has called for section 25 of the act to be repealed “consistent with changing societal norms and expectations”. “[The section of the act] is generally thought to have a disproportionate impact on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) workers, but the effect of the exemption is much more broad reaching,” the union said in a statement. “Our union has encountered examples where the exemption has a disproportionate effect on women, especially an unmarried pregnant woman, or a divorced person, or a person with a child to someone they are not married to. “While these people are all lawful participants of society and are widely accepted as not infringing on community standards, section 25 of the act may be used to justify a decision to terminate that person’s employment. “These exemptions are inherently unfair, out of step with modern community expectations and disproportionately affect the very sectors of society discrimination legislation is intended to protect.” The school said in a brief statement the wording in employment contracts was “under review” and that “new wording is awaiting approval”.",News/Australia news,Citipointe Christian College teachers threatened with dismissal for expressing homosexuality,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/21/citipointe-christian-college-teachers-threatened-with-dismissal-for-expressing-homosexuality
3/21/2022,"A toxic chemical released from tyres as they wear down on roads and implicated in mass deaths of salmon in the United States has been found in an Australian waterway for the first time. Scientists detected the compound – known as 6PPD-quinone – among a cocktail of chemicals and hundreds of kilograms of tyre particles washed into a creek from a motorway during storms. Researchers around the world are scrambling to understand the effect of the chemicals and particles from tyres after solving a mystery of years of mass deaths of coho salmon in Seattle. The commonly used tyre additive 6PPD – which transforms into 6PPD-quinone – was turning streams toxic for salmon. Earlier this month, scientists in Canada found the chemical was also toxic to two trout species, but at much higher concentrations. Scientists told Guardian Australia the latest finding should prompt urgent investigations to find out if Australian aquatic species are being harmed by 6PPD-quinone. University of Queensland scientists took water samples from the middle of Cubberla Creek beside Brisbane’s M5 motorway after four storms in late 2020 and published their results in a journal. Levels of 6PPD-quinone in the creek, which feeds into the Brisbane River, peaked at concentrations comparable to those found to be killing Seattle’s salmon. As much as 700kg of tiny tyre particles, up to 0.2mm wide and some much smaller, were estimated to wash off the roads and into the catchment after each storm. Lead author of the study, Dr Cassandra Rauert, an environmental chemist at the Queensland Alliance for Environmental Health Sciences at the University of Queensland, said they found elevated levels of the chemical for two days after storms. “The aquatic species living there are going to be exposed [to the chemical] over this period. The amount of tyre wear we found was also very surprising. “We have no idea of the effect of these particles or if fish are ingesting them. There are so many unknowns in this field. We should be worried, but we need to know more.” Rauert and colleagues are planning to take samples at other sites throughout Queensland, including catchments flowing into the Great Barrier Reef. Dr Edward Kolodziej at the University of Washington in Seattle was part of the team that linked the deaths of coho salmon to the tyre additive. He told the Guardian 6PPD-quinone was “one of the most toxic compounds known to exist for aquatic organisms”. After reading the Australian findings, he said: “Finding it at potentially lethal concentrations implies a substantial new and unmanaged risk for ecosystem health and sensitive aquatic organisms in these waters.” He said more data collection was needed to show where and how tyre wear was entering sensitive habitats. Prof Frederic Leusch, who leads research on aquatic toxicology at the Australian Rivers Institute, based at Griffith University, said the concentrations of 6PPD-quinone found in Brisbane were “not insignificant” and were likely representative of other areas around the country. Leusch, who was not involved in the study, said “until we check and test we won’t really know” the effect on any Australian species but this work was now needed. He said the emergence of 6PPD-quinone illustrated a failure in how chemicals were developed for use in products. While 6PPD as an additive in tyres was well-known, there was no prior knowledge of how it could transform when in use. The tyre particles themselves could also be posing problems for fish. Leusch said: “A small fish might have an intestine choc-a-bloc with these tyre particles and they can come with baggage of toxic chemicals. “All of these other chemicals I would wager we have no idea what they will do to fish or invertebrates in our rivers.” Authorities in California are looking to regulate the additive, which is used to stop tyres degrading and cracking. Kolodziej said because tyres were used “nearly everywhere people are present”, there was “a clear societal need to understand these products much better than we currently do”. Tyre makers in the US say they have started several initiatives and research projects related to 6PPD-quinone in that country and globally. Silvio de Denaro, acting chairman of the Australian Tyre Industry Council, said tyre manufacturing had not taken place in Australia for a decade, but added: “Obviously it is important to seek an alternative to [6PPD] in manufacturing.” Many councils used either capture ponds or other methods for road run-off and these could catch some chemicals, he said.",News/Environment,Chemical from tyres linked to mass salmon deaths in US found in Australia for first time,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/21/chemical-from-tyres-linked-to-mass-salmon-deaths-in-us-found-in-australia-for-first-time
