1/18/2022,"In response to the letter by David Green (12 January) and the subsequent one from a mother regarding her unvaccinated autistic son (13 January), I feel both have made very understandable points and it is clear that frustration is the enemy here. We have known about the dangers of misinformation for years, and these are now being felt keenly by the huge numbers choosing not to be vaccinated. Emmanuel Macron’s approach of making life more difficult for the unvaccinated (Report, 4 January) makes my heart sink. Surely that will only feed the misinformation beast and validate the screams of “don’t trust the government”. There is great power in hindsight, of course, but it is apparent that governments had ample warning that misinformation would be a problem for vaccine uptake. It seems that misinformation has been dumped in the “too difficult, with insufficient political gain” box, and we are reaping the consequences.  My father-in-law is unvaccinated by choice. I do not think he should be punished, nor do I think he deserves much sympathy. I simply wish that governments would offer a sensible and coherent strategy for tackling misinformation and mitigating its effects.Name and address supplied  Comparisons between Covid and health conditions due to poor lifestyle choices are flawed. Poor lifestyle choices do not, in the main, carry the risk of infecting and possibly killing others. It is this that makes vaccine opposition dangerous and why anti-vaxxers (except those with valid medical reasons) should face restrictions with regard to social and work situations while the pandemic continues. It’s their choice – infect yourself if you must, but don’t infect others.Dave GreenNorthampton  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

1/18/2022,"Five years ago the world felt a very different place. Pandemics belonged to disaster movies, the UK was reeling from the divisive Brexit vote but, with Theresa May newly installed as prime minister, the hope was that she might succeed in a soft Brexit and, in London, Simon Rattle’s imminent arrival as the London Symphony Orchestra’s chief conductor was eagerly anticipated and along with it the city’s transformative new Centre for Music. Hamburg’s Elbphilharmonie opened in January 2017 with a glittering gala attended by celebrities and dignitaries. The spectacular concert hall was praised for its bold design, its superb acoustics and its “exceptionally exceptional exceptionalness”. But in London the hope – back then – was that the city’s own new concert hall would one day also be a world-leading arts venue to compete with Hamburg’s.  January 2022 and our world has been reshaped by Covid. Brexit was indeed “got done”; Simon Rattle came, saw, but didn’t conquer, and London’s Centre for Music – the “Tate Modern of classical music” has been quietly axed. Meanwhile, in Hamburg the Elbphilharmonie is celebrating its fifth anniversary with a week-long festival – plans much scaled back due to Covid restrictions, but with visiting orchestras including our own LSO, plus Daniel Barenboim and the Staatskapelle Berlin, and the actual anniversary date celebrated by a concert of exclusively contemporary music, it is ambitious and confident, and a remarkable achievement given the strictures of the country’s 2G+ rules. When the building opened it was mired in controversy. More than six years late, it was many hundreds of millions of euros over budget – costs had risen tenfold, taking the final bill to €866m, of which €789m came from the city. None denied its architectural splendours, but had its long and agonising birth ensured that it was toxic, an eye-wateringly expensive white elephant funded by public money, programming classical music concerts for an elite; or would Hamburgians take it their hearts and learn to love this modernist marvel perched on the banks of the Elbe? The answer seems to be a resounding vote for the latter. With “Elphi”, as it is affectionately known, the city has a new centre of gravity. More than three million concert-goers to date have visited; concert audiences in the city have tripled and subscription concert-series subscribers have quadrupled. And, 80% of these audiences are from Hamburg itself. Meanwhile, it’s estimated that by spring of this year, 15 million will have visited the Plaza, the viewing platform 37 metres above ground level. “It has become a symbol of the city,” says Alan Gilbert, the US-born principal conductor of the NDR Elbphilharmonie, the hall’s resident orchestra. “People may never set foot inside the walls of the concert hall or care about the prestigious visiting orchestras for whom the city is now a must-stop on their itineraries, but they can still feel that it is something about which the city can feel proud.” As well as most of the world’s top orchestras and soloists, there have been concerts by stars from the wider musical world including Solange, the National, Rufus and Martha Wainwright, Caetano Veloso, and – in surely one of the most spectacular concert locations ever – techno marching band Meute performed 110 metres up, on the roof (one of many concerts available to watch on YouTube). And what then of the future? The gala concert that celebrated the anniversary featured four works by living composers, the prior evening’s concert also was weighted towards contemporary music, with Jörg Widmann sharing the bill with Beethoven. Few concert halls anywhere in the world would have the confidence to programme such an evening, let alone find every seat filled. But there’s plenty of work to be done still. Does a concert of contemporary music in 2022 that features only white male composers and a week in which every concert is conducted by a male conductor really represent a future-looking organisation? Gilbert acknowledges there’s room for improvement. “How to make sure we show enough representation of female composers and composers of colour … and not having enough female conductors is a huge factor in our conversations about programming,” he says. “It’s a new area and we have a long way to go. It’s about balance. We need to keep our advocacy of composers who have been important and add a new dimension to the way we think about things.” The building’s environmental credentials, too, do not make for comfortable reading in 2022, but, unlike the programming, very little can be done about that. “The hall was planned in 2004-06, at a time when energy use and environmental questions were not so important. It’s not up to standards that it would be had it been planned 10 years later,” admits Christoph Lieben-Seutter, the venue’s general and artistic director. “Obviously we do everything we can do with how we use resources, recycling garbage, and using only green energy,” he adds. An initiative in place since the launch offsets emissions (via non-profit organisation atmosfair) of air travel of visiting artists and staff business trips. “But yes, the building itself could be greener, let’s put it that way. We can’t change the glass facade – one of the features of the building.” Indeed, the dazzling curved glass facade that catches the reflections of the sky, the water and the city lights does make this one of the architectural marvels of the 21st century. Will the city get their money back? This seems unlikely, but the success of the project is not measurable in economic terms. “The idea that you have to justify such expenditure by showing the economic impact is fundamentally misguided,” says Gilbert. “But … I think it’s ultimately measurable that this has brought a new vitality into not just the cultural scene but the city itself. People are not talking so much now about the cost overruns because Hamburg has an icon.” Stream the 11 January anniversary concert (featuring John Adams, Thomas Ades and Esa-Pekka Salonen) here.

1/18/2022,"ENGLAND James Anderson His final Ashes series in Australia (surely) was bookended from the sidelines. In his three Tests, he was typically parsimonious but only at his barn-storming best at Melbourne. Blocked out that final over at Sydney. 6  Jonny Bairstow Grabbed his chance, scoring England’s one century of the tour: a gloriously brave and bombastic innings at Sydney. Batted well in the second innings as well to haul England to a draw. 7 Sam Billings The road-trip king and a breath of fresh air. Kept tidily, tiggerishly enthusiastic behind the stumps and made a jaunty 29 in the first innings at Hobart. 5 Stuart Broad Controversially wore the fluorescent bib during the first Test when David Warner scored 94, and at Melbourne. Tireless with the ball in hand and endlessly enthusiastic, if vocal at his frustration with the batting. 7 Rory Burns Posted the highest opening partnership of the tour with Zak Crawley in the final innings, but has little else to cling onto. Torpedoed with the first ball of the series. 2 Jos Buttler Nearly batted England to safety at Adelaide, and took some great catches (though dropped a few sitters). But found increasingly ludicrous ways of getting out. Injury was a sad end to his tour, and possibly his Test career. 4 Zak Crawley Looks a million dollars on song and has gumption. The weaknesses outside off stump remain but a long-term spot is his if he can just learn to be more circumspect. 5 Haseeb Hameed Ran his heart out in the field but, by the end, seemed to have largely forgotten how to score runs. Back to Trent Bridge to lick his wounds and (hopefully) come again. 2 Jack Leach Seems destined to be chronically mishandled by this England setup. Picked for the wrong game and left out for the right one. Grew in confidence at Sydney and left stranded on a hat-trick. 4 Dawid Malan Gave England’s middle-order some stability in two hundred-plus partnerships with Root early on in the series. Fell away towards the end and sadly missed the birth of his first child, born six weeks early. 5 Ollie Pope A tour to forget for England’s most promising young batsman™. Needs to find the right coach and psychologist to help him translate that immense talent into Test runs. Kept brightly when called for. 2 Ollie Robinson An undoubted asset for England, and has the knack of taking wickets, but must get fit quick so he can run in with as much enthusiasm for his third spell as for his first. 5 Joe Root Looked a broken man by the end. Still England’s highest scorer in the series, though that Australian century remains elusive. Must bear some responsibility for tactical errors but hampered throughout by a Spillikins top order. 6 Ben Stokes Came to the tour with no cricket in his back catalogue, and it showed. As stoical as ever but not incisive with the ball. Batted beautifully in Sydney on the counter attack. 4 Chris Woakes Didn’t manage to shake his reputation as a bowler most suited to home conditions. Considerably more successful with the bat than most of the top order and not afraid to have a biff. 4 Mark Wood Justly rewarded at last with 6-37 in Australia’s final innings of the series. Whole-hearted, fiery and England’s leading wicket-taker. His snorter to Usman Khawaja was England’s ball of the Ashes. 8 England’s man of the series: Mark Wood AUSTRALIA Scott Boland Grabbed his chance, doing for Australia what he has been doing for Victoria: hurtling in, hitting the deck, darting it around. England were hypnotised at Melbourne and Boland finished with 18 wickets at 9.55. 10 Alex Carey Won a last-minute call-up after Tim Paine withdrew. Started well but his form dipped towards the end, both with bat and gloves. That final innings at Hobart probably bought him another series. 5 Pat Cummins A series sprinkled with stardust after his sudden elevation. He was the series’ leading wicket-taker and one end of an electric spell of fast bowling that crazy Melbourne evening. 10 Cameron Green The baggy green Botticelli, Green burned with the brightness of the future. Ridiculously talented with both bat and ball and swallow-like at gully. Carefully under-bowled by Cummins. 9 Marcus Harris Has an odd bunny-hop trigger-movement but top scored at Melbourne in a low-scoring thriller. Unlucky to be dropped when he’d still make a composite team of the two sides. 5 Josh Hazlewood Bowled nicely in his one Test before injury ruled him out. England might have thought his absence would make their life easier – they were wrong. 7 Travis Head The series’ leading run-scorer, he sparkled from his 152 in the first Test to the counter-attacking England heart-breaker in the last, sailing through enforced Covid isolation en route. 9 Usman Khawaja Another Australian to grab his chance with both hands, a fairytale comeback with two blistering centuries at Sydney full of why-the-hell-not flourishes. Looked delighted to be back at the grand age of 35. 9 Marnus Labuschagne As quirky as ever and a constant thorn in England’s side. His patient 103 at Adelaide, his first Ashes century, took him past Joe Root as the World’s No 1 batsman. Not to be trusted with DRS decisions. 7 Nathan Lyon Such was Australia’s dominance, and England’s brittleness, that he wasn’t always needed. Still picked up 16 wickets and took a humdinger of a catch to dismiss Stokes at Hobart. 8 Michael Neser Got a chance at last at Adelaide, in the absence of Cummins, and picked up a wicket with just his second ball, as Hameed chipped it to midwicket. Bustled effectively. 6 Jhye Richardson After a tough first-innings, he took a five-fer in the second during a cameo appearance at Adelaide. His ability to skid the ball through caused England plenty of headaches. 7 Steve Smith A quiet series but an important one in his rehabilitation, leading Australia to victory at Adelaide while Cummins was in quarantine. His leg-break to Leach nearly took Australia over the line at Sydney. 6 Mitchell Starc Started the series by crushing England’s hopes in a single ball. Continued in the same vein, ever-threatening, and bowled with searing menace that Melbourne evening. Cricviz’s most threatening opening spell since records started. 9 David Warner Crushed English hopes with 94 at Brisbane but his form dribbled away, finishing with a pair at Hobart. By then, though, the Ashes were a long time won. 7 Australia’s man of the series: Pat Cummins",Sport/Sport,Ashes 2021-22: Player ratings for Australia’s ruthless rout of England,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/17/ashes-2021-22-player-ratings-for-australias-ruthless-rout-of-england

A swanky, plush new stadium under construction on the local docks? Tick. Joint top of the table or thereabouts after four games of the season? Tickety-tick, tick ... tick! Rewind just four months and life must have seemed pretty boss for your average Evertonian who might have been pootling around Bootle. Like a reverse Mike Ashley, majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri seemed to have the best interests of the club at heart, was happy to hose money on new players and had replaced one heavyweight European manager with another, albeit a man not everyone was prepared to welcome because of his association with Liverpool.  Of course that was then and this is now, a day after Agent Rafa’s dismissal following an embarrassing defeat against Norwich. The latest in a long run of largely diabolical performances that has yielded just two league wins from 15 matches, with the team plummeting to 16th in the table, it was the nadir of an already awful season. “Everton Football Club can confirm the departure of Rafael Benítez as first team manager,” harrumphed a short statement issued by the club. “Benítez, who joined Everton in June 2021 has left the club with immediate effect. An update on a permanent replacement will be made in due course.” Short and brutally to the point, the terse announcement made no mention of assorted knack to key players which had blighted Rafa’s time in charge, pointedly failed to thank him for his admittedly feeble efforts and certainly didn’t wish him well for the future. In summary: “Sling it! And don’t let those Goodison gates hit your backside on the way out.” Having picked up his P45, Rafa returned home and fired off a comparatively epic blog in which he pointed his Big Finger Of Blame at a lack of transfer funds, injuries, the impatience of his employers and Uncle Tom Cobley for the almighty mess in which Everton currently find themselves. And while there is plenty of blame for the current shambles to go around, Rafa did not seem prepared to accept any of it. So what now for Everton, who find themselves looking for their seventh boss in six years? Belgium manager Bobby M is the current underwhelming favourite for the gig, despite having previously been fired by the current regime. While Wayne Rooney, Big Dunc and Frank Lampard have also been mentioned. Moshiri is also known to be an ardent admirer of José Mourinho, who could be in line to trouser his latest multi-million payout from Roma any day now. If only to please those of us who are intrigued to see how much gas there might be left in this particular explosion, we implore Everton’s owner to give it to Big Dunc until such time as the Special One becomes available.

1/18/2022,"In my neighbourhood, there’s a “dark kitchen” – a warehouse run by a major takeaway platform, housing cooks for eight or nine restaurants. I probably wouldn’t have noticed it, were it not for the dog. He has the tenacity and skills of a truffle hunting pig – but for chicken. He could sniff out a wing buried under a rock encased in nuclear waste. Nine different cuisines, involving new and exciting ways to fancy up poultry, is like a siren going off in his head – complete sensory overload. The delivery guys, waiting outside in a snaking line with their electric bikes, like a scene from John Steinbeck with extra garlic, all say hello to him, and he enters a battle between his primal appetite and, to give him his due, his friendly manners. The appetite always wins. “Must get in the building,” say his straining neck muscles and the eyeballs nearly popping clean out of his head. “No time to lose!”  Yesterday, as I was going through this daily wrestle, a man came up and asked what I thought of my dog lead. “Well,” I embarked. “I only bought it because he snapped through the last one, which was made of chain metal, trying to kill a duck. So, sure, this is parachute material, every strand designed to withstand 500kg or whatever. But also he is essentially a Minotaur dressed in a fleece, so who knows how long it can last?” “I only ask,” he replied, “because I make the lead.” “I wish you’d said that to begin with: I would have just said something nice instead of giving you my life story.” “I like to get an honest opinion,” he replied. “Dark kitchens” are also known as “shadow kitchens”, “ghost kitchens” and “cloud kitchens”. Every one of those terms, apart from “cloud”, sounds nefarious – a black-ops scenario where maybe they’re making a chicken wrap, or maybe people are yelling expletives at each other and not allowed to go to the toilet. They weren’t invented for the pandemic, but have predictably boomed, particularly in London, though major platforms have also doubled their sites in Manchester and Leeds. And I’m desperate to know what goes on in them. Kitchens everywhere are famously brutal places. Chefs are generally bad tempered, a fact that, coupled with macho norms and multiple sharp or hot objects, can come off as an imminent threat to everyone else’s safety. Hours are unbelievably long. The command structure is modelled on the French military, so if you seriously displease your superior, he’s allowed to shoot you; or at least, that’s the atmosphere. And everyone behaves as though perfection is a matter of life or death, since to behave any other way – maybe this is just food, and they can live with the odd hair in it? – would lead to chaos. All that, by the way, is just a regular, “light” kitchen, a kitchen with diners sitting five feet away. I’ve been in restaurants with open kitchens and have still seen the chef scream at the underlings and waiters start crying. If you keep all that pressure and discipline but remove the civilising influence of the neutral observer, what would that look like? Is it like an arena scene in Gladiator: fierce solidarity in the teeth of awesome peril? Or the final episode of Breaking Bad: expert cooks in chains, shuffling lifelessly from one hob to another? Or perhaps everyone is much more relaxed, freed from the glare of annoying punters, and it’s more of a carnival? I’m never going to know unless I can get in there, and how can I get in there, when even the delivery guys have to wait outside? Obviously, if the dog got in there, I’d have to bust in to retrieve him. So what I need now is for his lead to break. I need a faulty parachute.

1/18/2022,"It is hard to imagine humans spending their lives in virtual reality when the experience amounts to waving your arms about in the middle of the lounge with a device the size of a house brick strapped to your face. But this is where humanity is heading, says the philosopher David Chalmers, who argues for embracing the fate. Advances in technology will deliver virtual worlds that rival and then surpass the physical realm. And with limitless, convincing experiences on tap, the material world may lose its allure, he says.  Chalmers, a professor of philosophy and neural science at New York University, makes the case to embrace VR in his new book, Reality+. Renowned for articulating “the hard problem” of consciousness – which inspired Tom Stoppard’s play of the same name – Chalmers sees technology reaching the point where virtual and physical are sensorily the same and people live good lives in VR. “A common way of thinking about virtual realities is that they’re somehow fake realities, that what you perceive in VR isn’t real. I think that’s wrong,” he told the Guardian. “The virtual worlds we’re interacting with can be as real as our ordinary physical world. Virtual reality is genuine reality.” It all started, as these things can, with the French philosopher René Descartes. Chalmers was pondering his question of how we can know anything about the external world. Modern philosophy often reframes this as a Matrix-style poser: how can we know we are not in a simulation? To cut to the chase, we can’t, Chalmers says. All of which leads to virtual reality. In the decades ahead, Chalmers suspects we will ditch the clunky headsets for brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs, that allow us to experience virtual worlds with our full suite of senses. With advances in computing – in the next century, perhaps – those worlds would seem as real as the physical world around us. On the point of philosophy, Chalmers argues that even today’s virtual worlds are “real”. A conversation in VR is a real conversation, he says. The objects in the virtual worlds are real too, he asserts, just made of bits instead of quarks and electrons. As virtual worlds become rich and convincing we will build virtual societies, take on virtual jobs, and have motivations, desires and goals that play out in those environments. “Most of the factors that make life meaningful are going to be there in virtual worlds,” he says. “There’s no good reason to think that life in VR will be meaningless or valueless.” But where does this leave the physical world? “In the short term we’re pretty clearly going to be based in physical reality and I certainly wouldn’t recommend abandoning it,” Chalmers says. “But in the longer term, it’s possible to imagine people spending most of their lives inside virtual reality.” The pursuit of the physical may come to seem a novelty or a fetish, he adds. There are plenty of pitfalls to be wary of, he notes. As fulfilling as virtual worlds may become, people will need real food, drink and exercise, and perhaps even the odd glimpse of daylight, to keep their bodies from withering away. The risks may be trivial for decades yet, Chalmers says, but a gradual trend towards virtual living could eventually raise new health issues. Writing in the book, he describes numerous draws that will pull people in to VR. These are worlds in which people can enjoy superhuman powers, possess other bodies, experience new sensations and explore environments with different laws of physics. With almost unlimited space, everyone can have a virtual mansion, or even a virtual planet. And if the physical world becomes dangerously degraded – by environmental collapse, nuclear war or an interminable pandemic – VR could offer a safe haven, he says. But the lure of VR might cause neglect on a global scale, Chalmers concedes. Would climate change and other crises facing the physical world lose their urgency? That would be a disaster, he says: “Physical reality is really important. We’ve got to keep a grounding in it and treat it well.” These are not the only concerns. Virtual worlds are owned by corporations that want a return on their investment. In October, Facebook rebranded as Meta, reflecting its ambition to dominate the “metaverse”, the virtual world it wants people to work and play in. Frances Haugen, the Facebook whistleblower, has raised serious concerns about more intrusive surveillance and data gathering in the metaverse. There is also the risk of psychological damage, she argues: if we are better looking and have better clothes and a nicer home in the metaverse, how will we feel when we leave? “If virtual worlds are controlled by corporations, as they seem to be right now, will that lead to potentially dystopian realities where the corporations are controlling everything in our environments? I think there are obvious reasons to worry about that,” Chalmers says. It is unlikely everyone will turn to VR, and some people, Chalmers says, will still value sheer physicality. “There may be a sense of authenticity in interacting in our original biological form. But it’s hard to see why sheer physicality should make the difference between a meaningful life and a meaningless life,” he writes. “In the long term, virtual worlds may have most of what is good about the nonvirtual world. Given all the ways in which virtual worlds may surpass the nonvirtual world, life in virtual worlds will often be the right life to choose.”",News/Technology,"‘Virtual reality is genuine reality’ so embrace it, says US philosopher",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/17/virtual-reality-is-genuine-reality-so-embrace-it-says-us-philosopher
1/18/2022,"Like their previous cinema and gallery-based collaborations, this latest work by co-directors Joana Hadjithomas and Khalil Joreige (A Perfect Day, I Want to See) tackles the painful legacy of the civil war and ongoing troubles of their homeland Lebanon. But while Memory Box playfully incorporates different media and filmic textures (8mm and 16mm footage, still photographs that turn into mini-animations, and the like) into its story, as did the co-directors’ earlier work, ultimately it is an eminently accessible feature film about three generations living through intense trauma and coming out the other side, mostly intact. That hopeful note resonates with a literal brightness as the last images capture the sun rising over Beirut, the raggedly indomitable city at the centre of the story and is effectively another character here. The action properly starts in the present day in Montreal where teenager Alex (Paloma Vauthier) lives with her mother Maia (Rim Turki) and grandmother Teta (Clemence Sabbagh). One snowy Christmas Eve, a huge box of journals, notebooks, cassette tapes and photographs arrives from France, all memorabilia that Maia sent from Beirut to her friend Liza in Paris while the Lebanese civil war of the 1980s was raging. (Some of the contents belonged originally to Hadjithomas.)  Afraid of the painful memories and long submerged secrets that the material might reveal, Alex is forbidden by her grandmother and Maia from looking at the box’s contents. Of course, like one of Bluebeard’s wives in the fairytale, she goes ahead and dives in. Consequently, she learns how the teenage Maia (played by Manal Issa in flashbacks) clashed with her parents, got obsessed with guys and her own looks, partied and experienced joy in a time when not only were there no mobile phones or WhatsApp, but there was a war going on with constant bombings and militia-run checkpoints where people were frequently killed. (You’d almost think that Hadjithomas and Joreige constructed the film as a service to contemporary parents dealing with privileged first-world teens complaining about trivial problems such as poor wifi or revoked car access.) In all seriousness though, this is a film with a deep reservoir of empathy for all its characters. While the oldest generation find themselves racked between the conventional expectations of the past and the gravest traumas of the times, the youngest are just as confused and lost, their pain no less real even if the causes seem less dramatic. Edited with minute attentiveness, the film switches back and forth between time periods adroitly in a way that always moves the story forward, while the outstanding performances from the whole ensemble, especially the watchful Vauthier and the fierce Issa, anchor the film.

1/18/2022,"The former England and Chelsea footballer Frank Lampard has escaped a charge of using a mobile phone while driving, after a case against him was dropped. The 43-year-old, who is also a former Chelsea manager, was filmed behind the wheel of his car in traffic in South Kensington, west London, last April by a cycling campaigner.  Lampard pleaded not guilty to the charge after hiring the solicitor Nick Freeman to fight his case. Freeman, also known as Mr Loophole, specialises in defending celebrities in traffic and speeding offences. Lampard denied using his mobile phone while driving his Mercedes. On Monday the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) confirmed the case would be dropped due to lack of evidence. A CPS spokesperson said: “After examining a file of evidence submitted by the Metropolitan police service, we concluded, in accordance with our legal test, there was insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction.” The Dutch YouTuber Mike van Erp – known as CyclingMikey – claimed he spotted Lambard chatting on his phone while holding a cup of coffee and controlling the steering wheel with his wrist. Van Erp, who had been due to appear as a witness at City of London magistrates court, was told last week his presence was no longer required. Speaking to Road.cc, he said: “I think he’s gotten off scot-free as the case was discontinued. A couple of coppers have said the justice system is broken and they are binning cases left and right to reduce the massive backlog.” At the time of the alleged offence Van Erp was quoted in the Evening Standard as saying he was “pretty disgusted” with Lampard’s driving. He said: “I was cycling southbound on Gloucester Road and caught up to queuing traffic in both directions near the Gloucester Arms. I noticed this driver of a black Mercedes 4x4 holding a coffee in his right hand, and a phone in his left. I could see him talking on the phone ... whilst resting his right inside wrist on the steering wheel.” Previous footage from Van Erp, who rides with a helmet-mounted GoPro camera, led to the prosecution of the former world champion boxer Chris Eubank after he jumped a red light in Hyde Park in his gold Rolls-Royce convertible last year. And his video of the film director, Guy Ritchie, seen driving while using his phone in 2020, led to a six-month driving ban.",Sport/Football,Charge against Frank Lampard of using phone while driving dropped,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/17/frank-lampard-charge-against-ex-player-driving-phone-car-dropped

1/18/2022,"The family of Martin Luther King Jr and other civil rights activists in America are honoring the late civil rights leader on Monday by pushing for expanded federal voting rights legislation despite political opposition from Republicans. Martin Luther King III, King’s eldest son, his wife, Arndrea Waters King, and their daughter, Yolanda Renee King, will lead a march on Monday morning across the Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge in Washington DC.  In a statement last week, King III spoke of his father, who would have turned 93 on Saturday, and said that the “stakes could not be higher to protect and expand” his father’s legacy of activism and racial justice. “Senators now face one of the most existential choices of their tenure: protect our voting rights or go down in history as an enabler of voter suppression,” he added. The Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, has announced that the Senate will take up voting legislation on Tuesday, though it is widely expected to fail. In December, more than 800 faith leaders, led by King III and his wife, called on the Biden administration and Senate Democrats to pass voting rights legislation. “The communities we represent will continue to sound the alarm until these bills are passed. While we come from different faiths, we are united by our commitment to act in solidarity with the most vulnerable among us,” they said in an open letter. Two Democrats, Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, have remained opposed to changing filibuster rules, which are necessary to move the bills through. The filibuster means most major legislation requires 60 votes to pass the Senate, not a simple majority, and the Senate is currently split 50-50 with the Democrats controlling a tie-breaking vote. On Saturday, King III urged Biden and the Senate to pass two measures aimed at expanding voting rights across the country – the Freedom to Vote Act and the John R Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. He went on to issue a “dire warning to the entire nation that our democracy stands on the bring without it”, adding: “The president said he’s tired of being quiet about voting rights. Well, we are tired of being patient.” Passing voting rights legislation is seen as crucial in the face of a wave of Republican state legislation that is aimed at erecting barriers to voting that experts say is likely to suppress the votes of communities of color.",News/US news,MLK’s family and activists honor civil rights leader with voting rights march,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/17/martin-luther-king-jr-march-family-activists-voting-rights
1/18/2022,"For most people, just a “yes” or “I will”, suffices. Megan Fox went a little further when the musician Machine Gun Kelly asked her to marry her. “Just as in every lifetime before this one,” she posted on Instagram “and as in every lifetime that will follow it, I said yes… And then we drank each other’s blood.” Kelly proposed under the same banyan tree, at the Ritz-Carlton Dorado Beach hotel in Puerto Rico, where the pair met a year earlier. At that time they were filming Midnight in the Switchgrass, a Bruce Willis crime-thriller with an 8% rating on Rottten tomatoes.  Kelly has since said he only took the role in the film so he could do a scene with Fox, which would be seen as incredibly creepy if they hadn’t hooked up, but now they’re getting married we can reclassify as cute. After hanging around her trailer for a while, Fox picked up on his presence and invited him to have lunch with her. She asked him how he was feeling and he replied, “I’m lost”. Fox reportedly replied, “well, let’s find you”, and the musician knew he had fallen in love. They have been finding each other, quite publicly, ever since: at their vampire-inspired GQ photoshoot where Kelly pretends to bite Fox’s neck while she gazes at the heavens in ecstasy; at the VMAS when Fox wore a barely-there Mugler dress and then told Entertainment Weekly her wardrobe choice had been inspired by Kelly telling her “you’re gonna be naked tonight” and her responding “whatever you say, daddy”; on an August webisode of Thirst Tweets for Buzzfeed Celeb when Kelly responded to a fan offering their feet for his delectation with the news that he was “only sucking one pair of toes”. For their first date, Kelly picked Fox up in a Cadillac and took her for a rose-petal strewn picnic on LA’s Topanga Canyon where they ate sushi and “breathed each other”. They subsequently got each other’s names tattooed on themselves. No PDA goes unavoided, when Fox posted an Instagram of their vacation let, she did so with the caption “the table at this air bnb saw some things 🥵”. The pair showed up to the launch of Kelly’s nail polish line chained together via their nails. Fox and Kelly do not consider themselves not just another couple. According to Fox they are not merely soulmates, but “twin flames”, which is “where a soul has ascended into a high enough level that it can be split into two different bodies at the same time”. After another pandemic year gave us the rise of the “normal celebrity” in the form of bland influencers like Addison Rae doing lackluster TikTok dances, the return of some real rockstar behavior is refreshing, even aspirational. Fox and Kelly have made love cool again, saving us from having to know which bland man with brown hair Taylor Swift is dating now, or pretending that Ye and New York socialite Julia Fox’s budding “romance” is anything but a W magazine psyop designed to sell Gap jumpers. They join fellow hot-girlfriend-and-pop-punk-boyfriend couple Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker, and even the (realistically, temporary) union of Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson, who were first spotted holding hands on a rollercoaster, in signaling the end of dour please-respect-our privacy partnerships and the return of youthful, teenage intensity about the person you’re with. Kelly – reciprocates such Fox’s reverence: he told Howard Stern that he “didn’t know what [love] was until me and her made eye contact”. Perhaps he can’t believe his luck – he is, after all, about to marry a woman whose posters he put on his teen bedroom wall. Fox has had a long spell away from the limelight. She says she felt ridiculed by the film industry for speaking out against the way she was treated on set in the early days of her acting career. “I feel like I was sort of out and in front of the #MeToo movement before the #MeToo movement happened, I was speaking out and saying, ‘Hey, these things are happening to me and they’re not OK,’” Fox confessed in a 2019 interview with Diablo Coady who she worked with on the film Jennifer’s Body. “And everyone was like, ‘Oh well, fuck you. We don’t care, you deserve it.’” But Fox’s relationship with Kelly seems to not only have brought her happiness, but inadvertently also helped to relaunch her as a major celebrity, once again returned to magazine front covers. People get a hard time for “being famous for being famous” but if celebrities aren’t going to do anything actually useful like redistributing their wealth let them at least keep us entertained by wearing vials of each other’s blood. “Some people give, like, a handkerchief to their partner or whatever,” Kelly said of the gift given to him by Fox early on in their relationship so that he could keep her close while she flew abroad for work. “She gave me her DNA.” Not since the days of Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee have we seen such unbridled, unhinged horniness.",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘Then we drank each other’s blood’: Megan Fox’s engagement is the return of the rockstar relationship,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/17/then-we-drank-each-others-blood-megan-foxs-engagement-is-the-return-of-the-rockstar-relationship
