1/14/2022,"Walmart’s (WMT) female truck drivers must either go to work wearing company-provided men’s pants, or pay to buy and launder their own uniform-compliant garments, according to a new lawsuit filed in federal court in Alabama. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission gave Alabama driver Diana Webb approval to file the proposed class action claiming sex discrimination against similarly situated female Walmart drivers, after the agency said it would not proceed further with its investigation. “I believe Walmart is discriminating against female truck drivers, and possibly other female employees who are required to wear uniforms,” Webb wrote in her Oct. 5 complaint to the EEOC.  “Walmart is providing and cleaning uniform bottoms for the men, while the women are expected to either wear men’s bottoms, or purchase and clean women’s bottoms on their own.” Webb has worked for Walmart as a driver since July 20, 2020, the lawsuit states. According to the complaint, drivers on the job who fail to wear clothing authorized by the company’s uniform policy can be fired right away. Walmart does provide its drivers with an entire uniform that includes pants and shirts, the suit states; however, the lawsuit says male pants are the only type of bottoms offered to drivers, regardless of their gender. “For female drivers, it is impossible to wear the men’s pants provided by Walmart specifically made to fit only male employees due to anatomical differences between the sexes,” the complaint states. “Female drivers are therefore required to either suffer discomfort, or purchase and launder their own pants, out of their own pocket, with no option for reimbursement, in order to fulfill Walmart’s employment requirements."" Webb also alleges that she requested that Walmart reimburse her for her out-of-pocket expenses to purchase multiple pairs of female pants and shorts to wear for work. Supervisors, she alleges, denied the request. Walmart will not launder any pants worn by female drivers that the company didn't provide, Webb adds, and therefore females, and not males, must incur the expense of washing their own uniform pants. Webb’s claim says in treating male and female employees differently, Walmart is violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits gender-based discrimination. In addition, the claim alleges that the company is unjustly enriching itself by sidestepping the expenses shouldered by its female drivers. As compensation, Webb is asking the court to disgorge Walmart of expenses it saved by allegedly discriminating against female drivers, to compensate drivers for their expenditures on purchasing and laundering their own uniform-compliant pants, and to award punitive damages.

1/14/2022,"Viewers tuning into Fox News over the past two days may have come away with the belief that defeated 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is absolutely ramping up a 2024 White House run. But finally, on Thursday, that reality-free bubble was busted a bit on-air when Fox News contributor Richard Fowler tossed cold water on the fantasy, calling it “ridiculous” and saying it “made no sense.” Citing a farcical Wall Street Journal op-ed written by two Trump-supporting political operatives urging Clinton to run as a “change candidate,” Fox News has run wild with the fanfic that the ex-secretary of state seeks a political comeback amid President Joe Biden’s sagging poll numbers. The column itself, as critics noted, is hard to take seriously, largely due to its authors and their motives for writing the piece. Doug Schoen, a former Clinton advisor, currently serves a contributor for far-right Newsmax and, in 2016, said he couldn’t support Hillary due to the James Comey letter. He’s also written numerous pieces speculating that Clinton may run for president again—something that’s been described as “concern-trolling Democrats.” (Schoen was previously a Fox News contributor, often branded a “Fox News Democrat” because of his penchant for bashing the party’s agenda while being labeled on-air as a Democratic consultant.) The other co-author, Andrew Stein, is a former Manhattan Burough president who supported Donald Trump in 2016 and published his endorsement in the Wall Street Journal’s opinion pages. Stein, who was convicted of tax evasion, wrote a similar op-ed in 2018 claiming “Hillary Will Run Again,” insisting she’d “easily capture the 2020 nomination.” (Clinton, of course, never came close to entering the 2020 race.) And yet—and perhaps unsurprisingly—as of Thursday afternoon, the network had run no less than 19 different segments on the notion that Clinton—a key focus of Fox News programming and right-wing outrage for decades—is gearing up for a 2024 run. At the same time, some Fox News personalities seemed to give away the game. “A lot of people say the reason that Donald Trump became president, he would not say it, but it was a vote against Hillary Clinton,” Fox News anchor John Roberts said Wednesday. “I love it,” MAGA-boosting host Jeanine Pirro later blared. “Because what a good time I might have!” During the second day of Fox’s round-the-clock coverage of Hillary-watch, Fox News anchor Harris Faulkner unironically reported that “speculation over a possible third White House bid by Hillary Clinton” was “gaining steam.” The “steam,” of course, was Fox’s repeated coverage of a single speculative opinion piece. Nevertheless, Faulkner added: “I can’t even believe we’re saying this.” After airing a clip from Fox News host Tucker Carlson telling viewers that you can’t dismiss the possibility of Clinton once again running for president because “she is not boring,” Faulkner turned to her guests for reaction. Both of them, for vastly different reasons, rejected a potential Clinton comeback out of hand. “I can tell you one thing, there is no way the Democrats will run Hillary Clinton,” former Trump advisory board member Jason Meister said. “Not for the reasons that I think Tucker said, actually. I think she is radioactive for a very specific reason,” he added, citing her role in funding the Steele Dossier Faulkner then turned to Fowler, one of the network’s resident liberal pundits who has worked as a Democratic political activist. “Richard, has your party run out of people in politics to run for the White House?” the host asked. “No, we haven’t,” he chuckled. “I read the op-ed that got this all started in the Wall Street Journal, by Schoen and Stein, and I thought it was utterly ridiculous and the arguments made absolutely no sense. You can’t say Hillary Clinton’s the most experienced candidate and a change candidate at the same time.” Fowler continued: “Which is why I give this argument little to know credence, not to mention the fact that Hillary Clinton is having a great time writing fiction novels and I’m pretty sure she enjoys doing that and doesn’t want to be on the campaign trail. And I’m actually somebody in the Democratic Party who has credentials.” Read more at The Daily Beast. Get the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox. Sign up now.

1/14/2022,"The virus that causes herpes is likely the main cause of multiple sclerosis (MS), a groundbreaking study has suggested. Harvard academics found that the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) - one of the most common viruses in the world - increases the chance of multiple sclerosis 32-fold. Scientists have long speculated that the virus may be linked to the condition, but have been unable to provide any evidence to back this up. “This is the first study providing compelling evidence of causality,” said Alberto Ascherio, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard Chan School and senior author of the study. “This is a big step because it suggests that most MS cases could be prevented by stopping EBV infection, and that targeting EBV could lead to the discovery of a cure for MS.” There is currently no cure for multiple sclerosis (MS), which is a condition that affects around 110,000 people in the UK. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society says the risk of developing MS in the general population is around one in 1,000. MS is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system that attacks the myelin sheaths protecting neurons in the brain and spinal cord, and its cause remains elusive. The symptoms are unpredictable and can range from physical disabilities like mobility problems to mental health conditions, such as depression. Many people with MS report feeling an overwhelming sense of exhaustion, making simple tasks a struggle. In around a quarter of cases, the first noticeable symptom is a problem with one of the patient's eyes, including colour blindness and double vision. In contrast, Epstein-Barr Virus infection is astoundingly common, and can be found in around 95 per cent of people. EBV infection can leave people feeling tired and sore, and is also known as mono or herpes. After a person contracts the pathogen, it remains in their system forever, often without any symptoms but occasionally reactivating. Prof Daniel Davis, professor of immunology at the University of Manchester, who was not involved with the research, said: “Well over 9 in 10 people are infected with this virus worldwide, usually in childhood, and only very rarely does a problem arise. “We already knew that this virus increases the risk of some cancer types, and now we know that it is also possibly a factor in multiple sclerosis, although it’s important to note for most people that have the virus, it will not cause them any problems. “Crucially, we do not know why only a small fraction of people infected with this virus develop a problem.” He added that other factors will be at play, such as genetics, and a cure may only be found once these have been identified. The US-based researchers studied the medical records of more than ten million people enlisted in the US military, of which 955 developed multiple sclerosis during their period of service. Blood samples taken twice a year by the military were analysed by the researchers to determine if the person had the virus, and this was cross-referenced against a later MS diagnosis, which normally only begins to manifest ten years after the identification of EBV. The risk of a person was found to be 32 times greater in people who tested positive for the herpes virus than in the minority of people who do not have EBV. A protein and biomarker for nerve degeneration called NfL only increased in those who had been infected with the virus, the researchers write in their study, published in the journal Science. Their findings cannot be explained by any other known risk factors for MS and suggest EBV may therefore be the leading cause. Professor Ascherio said: “Currently there is no way to effectively prevent or treat EBV infection, but an EBV vaccine or targeting the virus with EBV-specific antiviral drugs could ultimately prevent or cure MS.”",Health/The Telegraph,"Herpes virus ‘likely’ main cause of multiple sclerosis, study finds",https://news.yahoo.com/herpes-virus-likely-main-cause-190156400.html
1/14/2022,"Correction officers at Rikers Island allowed an inmate to take control, a former detainee alleged. The inmate had designer sneakers in his cell and multiple bins of food, The New York Times reported. Video obtained by the Times shows an alleged ""Fight Night"" and officers failing to intervene. A former detainee at New York City's Rikers Island jail complex said correction officers allowed a gang-leader inmate to essentially seize control of a unit, adding that he was forced to participate in a ""Fight Night"" while the staff did nothing, a report said. Correction officers at the George R. Vierno Center — an 850-bed facility on Rikers Island — often deferred to the gang leader, known as Bacalao, the former detainee said, The New York Times reported. In a brazen violation of jail rules, Bacalao kept designer sneakers, such as Jordans and Yeezys, in his cell, as well as eight bins of food, spices, and clothing, The Times reported on Wednesday. Bacalao also had a more comfortable bed than other inmates in his cell after piling seven of the thin, jail-issued mattresses on top of each other. The inmate who made the accusations — a former member of the Crips gang referred to in the report as Relator G. — had been arrested in June on first-degree robbery charges and was ultimately housed in a unit with members of the Dominican gang Trinitarios where he was jumped and jabbed with sharp objects, according to The Times. Bacalao had told the attackers that Relator G. was ""good,"" and they backed off, the report said. The gang leader then told Relator G. of the rules of ""his house,"" which included: take a shower, keep your cell clean, and attack new people when they arrive to the jail, The Times reported. A judge ultimately ordered the release of Relator G. last month after he had been forced to participate in a ""Fight Night"" at the jail in which guards failed to intervene. The Times obtained and published shocking video footage showing the October 19 fight inside cell 15 of the jail as at least one correction officer looked on without stopping the brawl. —The New York Times (@nytimes) January 13, 2022 Bacalao had ordered the men to fight for the enjoyment of other detainees, according to the Times. The winner was awarded a cigarette, The Times reported, citing court records and interviews. Relator G., who has been arrested five other times over the years, told The Times that conditions had worsened at the notorious lockup. ""I don't think there's no fixing jail,"" he said. ""It's going to keep getting worse because it has been going on for so long."" In a statement to Insider on Thursday, a city Department of Correction spokesman said: ""We take any claims of unsafe conditions in our facilities very seriously. We are actively investigating this case and we remain fully committed to creating a safer and more humane environment in our jails.""

1/14/2022,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — A lawyer for ex-Raiders wide receiver Henry Ruggs’ girlfriend said Thursday he’ll appeal a Las Vegas judge’s decision to grant prosecutors access to the woman’s medical records after a fatal high-speed crash that cost Ruggs his spot on the team. Attorney Peter Christiansen’s appeal on behalf of Kiara Je’nai Kilgo-Washington would block access to Kilgo-Washington’s records until the question is settled. Christiansen declined to comment further after Las Vegas Justice of the Peace Ann Zimmerman ruled prosecutors can obtain Kilgo-Washington’s written medical records, but not testimony from medical professionals who treated her following the Nov. 2 crash. In court filings, the attorney maintains Kilgo-Washington is not charged with a crime and her health information is protected by federal and state doctor-patient confidentiality laws. Prosecutors have said they expect the records will show Kilgo-Washington suffered substantial injury in the crash. Kilgo-Washington and Ruggs have a young daughter together. Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson has said prosecutors were told Ruggs suffered a leg injury and Washington underwent surgery for an arm injury. Both were hospitalized after the wreck that sparked a vehicle fire that killed 23-year-old Tina Tintor and her dog, Max. Another judge previously granted prosecutors access to Ruggs’ medical records. He is charged with felony driving under the influence causing death and substantial bodily injury, and two counts of felony reckless driving. He remains on house arrest pending a March 10 preliminary hearing of evidence and a judge's decision whether he will stand trial in state court. The 22-year-old former first-round NFL draft pick is accused of driving 156 mph (251 kph) in a residential area with a blood-alcohol level of 0.16% — twice the legal limit in Nevada — before his Chevrolet Corvette slammed into the rear of Tintor’s vehicle. Ruggs was released by the Raiders several hours after the crash. He also was charged with misdemeanor gun possession after police reported finding a loaded handgun in his wrecked sports car after the crash. Ruggs would serve at least a mandatory two years in prison and could get more than 50 years if he’s found guilty on all charges.",U.S./Associated Press,Attorney to appeal Vegas ruling in Ruggs crash records case,https://news.yahoo.com/attorney-appeal-vegas-ruling-ruggs-195926966.html
