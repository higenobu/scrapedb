3/4/2022,"Young Russian elites are advocating for peace in Ukraine on social media, highlighting the generational divide that threatens Putin's power in Russia. Russian elites publicly protesting the war include the children of oligarchs and government officials close to Putin. Sofia Abramovich is a 26-year-old professional equestrian. In a post to her Instagram story, she said Putin is the one that wants war, not Russia. The post explained that the rhetoric of Russia wanting war was Kremlin propaganda. Sofia’s father Roman Abramovich is the embattled owner of Chelsea FC. Despite accusations, he denies having links to the Kremlin. https://www.instagram.com/p/CYZI_pQrkAb/ Ksenia Sobchak, a socialite and former presidential candidate, has fled Russia and is now in Turkey with her son. Her parents are the former mayor of St. Petersburg and a Russian senator. She has kept advocating, and yesterday posted a picture to Instagram calling for a cease-fire. The caption reads that she is scared and calls on Putin and his government to end the war. https://www.instagram.com/p/CamxdozMf64/ Elizaveta (Lisa) Peskova, the daughter of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also posted to her Instagram account. For a brief hour, a story included the hashtag #notothewar. Peskova is the vice president of the Foundation for the Development of Russian-French Historical Initiatives and appears to be close to her father. Last week, her father stood up for the arrests of protesters saying that by law, rallies are not allowed. https://www.instagram.com/p/CVIlI1rjIDM/ Maria Yumasheva, the granddaughter of former Russian president Boris Yeltsin and daughter of current government advisor Valentin Yumashev, has also shown support for Ukraine. Yumasheva’s father helped Putin come to power by suggesting he would be a great candidate to Yelstin, the former president of Russia. Yumasheva’s latest Instagram post shows a photo of the Ukrainian flag captioned “no war,” and she tweeted the same, according to Yahoo. The 19-year-old attended an anti-war rally in London earlier last week to show her solidarity with Ukrainians. Her fiancé Fedor Smolov, a striker for Dynamo Moscow and Russia, was was one of the first national team players to speak up against the invasion. https://www.instagram.com/p/CaW1gXSrQKW/ Andrey Rublev has also spoken out. The 24-year-old Russian tennis player wrote on the TV camera, “No war please,” after winning a match in Dubai. These young elites are not alone, and many in the world share the sentiment. Rallies around the world have broken out against the Kremlin. In Russia, around 1,700 people have been arrested since the invasion started, and last week someone even wrote “No to War” on the front door of the Russian parliament.

3/4/2022,"A former lawyer for the Chicago Park District is suing Lori Lightfoot after the Chicago mayor chewed him out on Zoom, allegedly claiming to have the “biggest dick” in the Windy City. George Smyrniotis, who worked for the park district as deputy general counsel before he stepped down last month, says in his lawsuit that the trouble began over a plan to include a controversial statue of Christopher Columbus during an annual parade organized by the city’s Italian American community. The prominent statue, which stood near Lake Michigan downtown, was one of several Columbus statues around the city that Lightfoot had ordered removed in the wake of social-justice protests in the summer of 2020. After the mayor’s order, the Joint Civic Committee of Italian Americans sued the Park District. A New Mayor but the Same Killer Cops and Coverups in Lori Lightfoot’s Chicago Smyrniotis alleges that he was then asked by the district’s chief lawyer and a city superintendent to collaborate with the Italian organization to find a solution and settle the suit “as soon as possible.” As reported by the Chicago Tribune, Smyrniotis and lawyers representing the Italian Americans came to a solution: the community would be allowed to include the statue of Columbus during their annual parade, but Columbus would have to ride last—and would be kept concealed until the very end. But before the deal was finalized, Smyrniotis claims Lightfoot abruptly called him into a Zoom meeting. “You dicks, what the fuck were you thinking,” the mayor began, according to Smyrniotis’ complaint. “You make some kind of secret agreement with Italians... You are out there measuring your dicks with the Italians seeing who's got the biggest dicks.” “You are out there stroking your dicks over the Columbus statue,” she continued. “My dick is bigger than yours and the Italians, I have the biggest dick in Chicago.” According to the complaint, the mayor was irate because Smyrniotis hadn’t run the deal past a city lawyer. She went on to attack the Park District lawyers’ credentials, he claimed. “Where did you go to law school? Did you even go to law school? Do you even have a law license?” she allegedly asked. Lightfoot allegedly then told the team to get that “fucking statue back before noon” and also threatened at some point to yank the Italian Americans’ parade permit. The lawsuit claims Smyrniotis—who resigned from the Park District last month—was defamed by the aggressive, condescending comments. A Law Department spokeswoman told the Chicago Tribune: “The city has not yet been served with a complaint and will have no further comment as the matter is now in litigation.” Read more at The Daily Beast.
