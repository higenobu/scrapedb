4/19/2022,"The images and video show the ship tilting to its port side with large plumes of thick black smoke billowing upward. The Pentagon confirmed that the Moskva sunk after being hit with a Ukrainian missile. The Moskva weighed 12,000 tons and was more than 600 feet long, with a crew of 500. New images show the Russian warship Moskva burning shortly before it sank into the Black Sea. The images and video show the ship tilting to its port side with large plumes of black smoke billowing upward. Experts say the photos and video are of the Moskva, according to the Guardian, but their origin is unknown. The Pentagon confirmed last week that Ukrainian forces sank the Moskva with at least one Neptune anti-sink missile on Thursday, lending credence to Ukrainian forces' version of events. Russia and Ukraine agree that the Moskva was damaged after ammunition detonated on board, but have different accounts of what led to the ship's sinking. Russian officials claimed the ammunition exploded due to a fire on board whose cause was being investigated, while Ukrainian officials said it had struck the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles causing ""serious damage."" The Moskva weighed 12,000 tons and was more than 600 feet long, with a crew of 500. The sinking of the warship named for the Russian capital is a huge blow to Russian morale, and is unlikely to be easily explained away by Russian officials to their population. Russia's defense ministry claimed on April 14 that all crew members had been evacuated from the ship, and the Pentagon saw Russian sailors leaving the damaged ship in lifeboats, according to the Washington Post. But the mother of one surviving sailor told the Novaya Gazeta Europe that about 40 people had died during the incident and many were wounded and missing, the Post reported. ""There are dead, there are wounded, there are missing. My son called me when they were given phones. They left their documents and [their personal] phones on the [ship]. He calls me and cries from what he saw. It was scary. It is clear that not everyone survived,"" the anonymous mother said.

4/19/2022,"A Virginia house that was listed for $800,000 came with a catch: a person living in the basement. The home also needs an estimated $25,000 in repairs, according to its Zillow listing. After a few days on the market, the home appears to have found a buyer. A five-bedroom, four-bathroom house in Fairfax, Virginia, made headlines soon after it hit the market for $800,000 on April 10. While it might look like a regular colonial home, the sale had a few contingencies: There's at least one person living in the basement — which prospective buyers couldn't view — according to its listing on Zillow. Nevertheless, the home was pending sale on Zillow days after it was listed, and within a week it was off-market. According to Fox5, a DC news outlet, the listing agent said the property received five offers and is under contract for an amount that's ""a bit"" above the asking price as of Tuesday evening. The listing's real-estate agent did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. ""CASH OFFERS ONLY NO ACCESS to see lower level,"" the listing's description, which is still available to view on Zillow at the time of writing, says. ""Home sold AS IS ONLY with acknowledgment that home will convey with a person(s) living in lower level with no lease in place."" According to Fox 5's David Kaplan, neighbors told the outlet that a mother and daughter live in the basement of the home. The relationship between the seller and the tenants is unclear, Fox 5 reports. The Zillow listing describes the property as ""livable"" but needing ""some TLC."" The 3,548-square-foot home has a sliding door that needs replacing, a broken dishwasher, leaking toilet, carpet that needs updating, and rotting windows, according to the listing, which estimates that repairs would cost the buyer $25,000. The listing's photos appear to be unstaged. They show a pile of empty soda bottles and cans in the kitchen, a broken plant pot on the deck, exterior siding covered in a green mold, and stained towels and clothes in the bathroom. The listing gained attention after it was shared by Zillow Gone Wild, a popular social-media account that highlights unique properties from the real-estate company, on Tuesday. On Instagram, where Zillow Gone Wild has 1.4 million followers, the account's post about the Virginia house has close to 35,000 likes at the time of writing. And on Facebook, where the account has 845,000 followers, its post featuring the home has more than 9,300 likes and 2,500 shares at the time of writing. Thousands of users questioned the value of the home and joked about the unique circumstances of the sale in the comments under the posts. For example, one commenter on Facebook wrote: ""Wow! What a deal! You mean I get all this — rotting door and window frames, leaky toilets, and broken appliances — PLUS the added bonus of a squatter or two in the basement??? Where do I sign???"" The home appears to be middle of the range in the Fairfax market. According to Zillow, the typical home in Fairfax is valued at $715,000. At the time of writing, there are 14 other five-bedroom homes for sale on Zillow in the area, which cost between $699,999 and $1.6 million. None of them, however, come with a roommate.

4/19/2022,"By Idrees Ali and Kanishka Singh WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States military expects to start training Ukrainians on using howitzer artillery in coming days, a senior U.S. defense official said on Monday. Last week, U.S. President Joe Biden announced an additional $800 million in military assistance to Ukraine, expanding the aid to include heavy artillery ahead of a wider Russian assault expected in eastern Ukraine. So far, four flights of weapons have been sent by the United States as part of the new package. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the howitzer training would take place outside Ukraine. The United States is planning on teaching Ukrainian trainers on how to use some of the new batch of weapons such as howitzers and radars and then for the trainers to instruct their colleagues inside Ukraine. The United States has previously trained Ukrainian forces on Switchblade drones. Ukraine said a Russian missile attack killed seven people in Lviv on Monday, the first civilian victims in the western city, and the commander of Ukrainian forces holding out in the devastated southeastern port of Mariupol appealed to the pope for help. It appeared that Russia was aiming at military targets in Lviv and the capital Kyiv in the north, the U.S. defense official said. Mariupol was still contested as Russia appeared to have sent reinforcements into Ukraine in recent days, the official added. ""Our assessment is Mariupol is still contested ... (it) remains under threat from the air but both from missile strikes as well as bombs from the air but even of course artillery,"" the official said. The official said there were roughly 76 Russian battalion tactical groups in southern and eastern Ukraine, an increase of about 11 in recent days. Over the weekend, the Russian defense ministry said its anti-aircraft systems in the Odesa region shot down a Ukrainian transport plane delivering weapons supplied by Western governments. The official said that the United States did not have any information to suggest that was true. There were no indications that Russia was making any attempt to recover the warship Moskva, flagship of its Black Sea fleet, that sank on Thursday, the U.S. official said.

4/19/2022,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A Florida judge said on Monday that a U.S. mask mandate on public transportation is unlawful, overturning a Biden administration effort to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Last week, U.S. health officials extended by 15 days the mandate requiring travelers to wear masks on airplanes, trains, and in taxis, ride-share vehicles or transit hubs, saying they needed time to assess the impact of a recent rise in COVID-19 cases. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle, an appointee of President Donald Trump, came in a lawsuit filed last year in Tampa, Florida, by a group called the Health Freedom Defense Fund. Judge Mizelle said the CDC had exceeded its authority with the mandate, had not sought public comment and did not adequately explain its decisions. The Transportation Security Administration and Federal Aviation Administration declined to comment. The White House and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) did not immediately comment. The CDC first issued a public health order requiring masks in interstate transportation in February 2021. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) issued a security directive to enforce the CDC order. The judge sent the issue back to the CDC. It was not clear if the judge's order would take immediate effect. Industry groups and Republican lawmakers had wanted the administration to immediately end the 14-month-old mask mandate last week. Airlines for America, for example, had urged the Biden administration ""to lean into science and research, which clearly support lifting the mask mandate. It makes no sense to require masks on a plane when masks are not recommended in places like restaurants, bars or crowded sports facilities."" The group, which represents major U.S. passenger airlines, did not have an immediate comment on Monday's ruling.
