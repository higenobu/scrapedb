2/18/2022,"The University of California, Berkeley may have to slash its new admissions by about one-third after a neighborhood group in the hilly Bay Area city challenged the environmental impact of the top college’s expansion plan.  The university is asking California’s supreme court to intervene after the local group, called Save Berkeley’s Neighborhoods, successfully argued the university was violating a major environmental law by failing to account for increases in the trash, traffic and noise that increased enrollment and new construction would bring. As a result, the university will have to send out 5,100 fewer admission letters than planned next month, and forgo $57m in tuition fees over the 2022-23 academic year. The case sits at the intersection of several big debates roiling California at the moment: how to reduce educational inequities and rein in increasingly unaffordable tuition fees? How to address a housing crisis even as nimby homeowners seek to stifle new development? At the center of the UC Berkeley case is the state’s environmental law – the California Environmental Quality Act – which critics say is being brazenly used by neighborhood groups to block necessary housing and infrastructure using the pretense of environmentalism. It has also raised the alarm that amid unprecedented demand for higher education in California, thousands of students will miss their chance at a degree from one of the top US universities. The construction project near campus that triggered Save Berkeley’s Neighborhoods’ challenge would replace an existing parking structure with accommodation for 30 graduate students, and classroom space for the university’s public policy program. In its environmental impact study for the new construction, the university argued increased enrollment previous years had “no significant environmental impacts”. UC Berkeley has also said that it should be able to address the concerns raised in the lawsuit without having to limit enrollment in the meantime. But in August, a county judge disagreed. “Further increases in student enrollment above the current enrollment level at UCBerkeley could result in an adverse change or alteration of the physical environment,” superior court judge Brad Seligman wrote, ordering the school to freeze enrollment at the same level as 2020-21. The court’s assessment essentially concluded that crowded classrooms full of college students posed an environmental threat akin to a highly-polluting highway project, said Jennifer Hernandez, an attorney who often defends developers from CEQA litigation. Save Berkeley’s Neighborhoods has stated that the university, which has increased its enrollment from 31,800 in 2005 to 43,100 last year, has failed to provide adequate housing for students. The group argues students have pushed into the city and impacted housing prices and homelessness in surrounding communities. It has further suggested that the university adjust admissions to let in fewer students from other states and other countries – who pay higher tuition fees than California residents – to admit more locals. “UC Berkeley students themselves have repeatedly said that UC should stop increasing enrollment until it can provide housing for its students,” said Phil Bokovoy, president of Save Berkeley’s Neighborhoods. “We are all very concerned that UC Berkeley will create a housing crisis next fall.” But critics of the group have countered that while the university should do more to house students – many of whom struggle to find apartments and afford rents in one of the most expensive California regions – Save Berkeley’s Neighborhoods shouldn’t be blocking the development of new housing in making that point. Bokovoy, who is a graduate of UC Berkeley himself, has suggested that the university expand elsewhere in the Bay Area. The university has not yet detailed how it would decide which offers to rescind if the freeze were to go ahead. But it has said the losses in tuition revenue would reduce the university’s capacity to offer financial aid to low-income students and could limit class offerings. Because many graduate students have already received their admissions letters and because of the number of new admits the university would have to cut down, undergraduate students are expected to be most affected. Riya Master, a senior at UC Berkeley and the external affairs vice-president for Associated Students of the University of California, a student association, said she worried that lower-income, first-generation and minority students who might have had fewer extra-curricular activities listed on their applications due to the opportunities that were available to them would be disproportionately affected. Environmental law is “not being used with the intention of protecting the environment. It’s being used to limit access, it’s being used to keep the neighborhood the way an older, primarily white generation wants it to be”, Master said. In a letter to prospective students, Olufemi Ogundele, director of undergraduate admissions, wrote: “This is unsettling news, we know” and reassured students that the university is working to avoid a reduction in new admits. The freeze on admissions would come as the demand for seats in the University of California system continues to rise. Applications to the UC schools have soared, especially since the state university system phased out a requirement to submit standardized entrance exam scores. Applications to the schools were also up among Black and Latino Californians. The number of students who took semesters off due to Covid-19 seeking to return to campus this fall will further squeeze the university’s ability to admit new students, UC Berkeley said. “This is a disaster for the university, and this is a disaster for students,” said Ozan Jaquette, an assistant professor of higher education at the University of California, Los Angeles. “It’s the meanest thing I’ve ever heard.” For many students, a degree from a highly-regarded public institution is a “big massive engine of social mobility”, he noted, adding that there would not be a way that Berkeley could feasibly reduce admissions to the extent currently required without it affecting students from all backgrounds. “Trying to use CEQA as a population control statute is a real slippery slope,” said Hernandez, the attorney. The CEQA, a landmark law initially signed into law in 1970 by then-governor Ronald Regan, has recently been at the center of several high-profile court cases challenging developments. The state’s attorney general has intervened in some cases that use CEQA to challenge new construction in fire-prone wildlands. But the state’s strict environmental laws are also used to challenge in-fill construction in cities, including affordable housing. Over the past several years, CEQA has been used to delay or block the development of affordable apartments for disabled veterans in Los Angeles and a 500-unit building in housing-crunched San Francisco. Recently, the wealthy Bay Area town of Woodside tried to use the state’s endangered species law to block the construction of new duplexes. The law can be exploited by people who want, rather than protect California from the effects of climate change and pollution, to preserve “their own personal environment, as they experience it, outside their window when they want to take a quiet nap in the afternoon”, she said.",News/US news,Top California university may have to slash admissions after neighborhood group complains,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/17/california-ucb-student-housing-local-group-lawsuit
2/18/2022,"There were five minutes to go when Luuk de Jong was introduced at the Camp Nou and maybe it should have been more. Barcelona were drawing 1-1 with Napoli in their first game in this competition for two decades, seeking the goal that would give them a lead for the second leg in Italy. They almost got it too, the Dutch striker they had tried to move on in the winter coming closer in a frantic finale than anyone else had done in the previous 85 minutes. In the end, though, De Jong’s comic-book moment wasn’t quite enough, his overhead kick flashing just past the post, and Barcelona ran out of time. Ferran Torres scored the penalty that levelled things after Piotr Zielinski gave Napoli the lead, but he above all will reflect on the ones that got away on a night when Barcelona and Napoli were playing for a place in a competition that they aspire to avoid.  “It annoys me to hear the Champions League anthem and not be part of it,” Xavi had said. Instead, he stood before this game at an unusual time, listening to an unusual anthem and watching his team join Napoli in taking the knee, which was unusual too. Barcelona had not played on a Thursday night in Europe’s second competition since they faced Celtic in 2004. The opponents, though, were more familiar – Napoli and Barcelona had met in the last sixteen of the Champions League just two years ago – and there were 73,500 in the Camp Nou, 5,000 or so of those from Italy, a sense that this did matter and a sound to match. Xavi had called it an opportunity, a trophy this club had never won and one that might allow them to take a Champions League place far from certain via La Liga. Luciano Spalletti felt the same, no concessions made in his line-up. There was an intensity about Napoli too: while Barcelona had most of the ball, the Italians were swift and incisive when they broke, able to escape into the space beyond the home defence. That was shown when Victor Osimhen was brilliantly released up the left after 20 minutes, dashing onto a beautifully bent ball and into the area only to be denied by Marc André ter Stegen at the near post. Every time Osimhen set off, the threat was palpable, Barcelona struggling to handle him. Barcelona started with three of their winter signings up front together for the first time. The fourth signing, Dani Alves, was not registered for the competition, a decision Xavi admitted to regretting already the day before. Without him, Adama Traoré found himself double-teamed, denied the room to run. Of the three forwards, it was Ferran Torres who would get the first half chances, although not until Pedri had shot over and Nico Gonzalez had drawn a sharp save from Alex Meret, and he did not take them. Napoli did – and immediately. Played in by Pedri and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Torres’s shot went way wide with the goal opening before him just before the half an hour. He was still lamenting that miss when Napoli scores. A lovely exchange between Piotr Zielinski and Eljif Elmas, a double one-two on the right, opened up Barcelona. Ter Stegen saved Zielinski’s initial shot but he was fastest to the rebound, smashing the ball into the top of the net. Torres curled another effort wide and headed over, while Kalidou Koulibaly recovered astonishingly quickly to cut down Traoré as he was sent racing through, but Barcelona reached half way without finding a way through. The volume rose in the second half and so did the velocity, Nico the most active, leading his team-mates forward and twice taking aim from around the edge of the area. The breakthrough moment went unseen, though. Traoré’s cross had brushed the hand of Juan Jesus, unnoticed by anyone here but spotted in the VAR room. Istvan Kovacs was called to the screen and eventually pointed to the spot. This time, Ferran finished cooly. An hour had gone and Barcelona were on top now, Aubameyang firing over just after. Xavi made a treble change that included Ousmane Dembele, who was whistled and booed as he came on and with every touch for the next few minutes. Until, that was, the applause that began to break out each time he received possession eclipsed it, reflecting a realisation that, actually, it might be better to support him. They needed him, after all. Dembele almost escaped Juan Jesus and then he got away up the right but couldn’t pull back for Aubameyang. When the roles were reversed soon after, Dembele’s shot was blocked. Still no way through, it was time for De Jong, a huge roar greeting his introduction with five minutes left. He would get the chance to be a hero in a wild finale too, although the best opportunities fell elsewhere. First, Dembele and Sergiño Dest advanced on the right and supplied Pedri who flicked it to Torres, only to see him sky his effort. A moment later, Dembele again escaped, this time his pullback, right across the six-yard box, didn’t find a finisher. And then De Jong sent a sensational overhead kick just past the post, this grand old stadium chanting his name and suddenly silenced when Dries Mertens should have won it at the other shooting straight at Ter Stegen when he was provided with a glorious chance to win it. Torres should have won it too, but another shot sailed into the stands, taking Barcelona’s opportunity with it. There was still time for one last header for De Jong but a draw would have to do on their first Thursday night for long time.",Sport/Football,Ferran Torres’s first goal for Barcelona levels up Napoli tie,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/17/barcelona-napoli-europa-league-match-report
2/18/2022,"Good morning. The US president, Joe Biden, has warned the threat of a Russian invasion into Ukraine is imminent. Covid restrictions in New South Wales and Victoria begin easing from today, and marine scientists call for calm after a fatal shark attack in Sydney. Restrictions introduced to curb the spread of Omicron across Australia’s two most populous states will be eased over the next week as cases continue to drop in NSW and Victoria. The changes, similar across both states, will begin to take effect from Friday. However, the lifting of the indoor mask mandate remains another week away. In Victoria, from 6pm on Friday, density limits at hospitality and entertainment venues will be removed, dancefloors can reopen and QR code check-ins will no longer be required in retail settings, schools and many workplaces. In NSW, from 12.01am Friday, density limits will be scrapped, QR codes will remain only for nightclubs and music festivals with more than 1,000 attenders, and singing and dancing can resume at venues other than at festivals.  Joe Biden has said he believes Russia is on the brink of invading Ukraine, as he joined Nato allies in warning that shelling in the Donbas region may be an attempt to set up the pretext for an incursion. Claims of attacks by Russian-backed separatists at several locations in Ukraine’s eastern territory, including at a kindergarten and a school, were said to bear the hallmarks of an attempt to incite conflict. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, has claimed the shelling of a nursery school in the Donbas region was a “false-flag operation” aimed at discrediting the Ukrainian government. Ukraine also accused Russia on Wednesday of being behind a cyber-attack that targeted two banks and its defence ministry, which the country’s deputy prime minister said was the largest of its type ever seen. The Kremlin denied it was behind the denial of service attacks – attempts to overwhelm a website by flooding it with millions of requests – but the disruption reignited wider concerns of ongoing cyber-conflict. Leading shark scientists have called for calm after the death of a male swimmer at a beach in Sydney’s east on Wednesday. Dr Vanessa Pirotta, a marine predator researcher at Macquarie University, said the incident at Little Beach had shaken the community because of its apparent randomness. “It’s not every day you hear of a shark incident like this,” she said. “That’s why there’s so many people talking about it, and the fact people have seen it first-hand means there’s a lot that plays on people’s minds.” Dr Leonardo Guida, shark scientist at the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said shark bites were traumatic incidents which “while rare, [required] thoughtful, evidence based action”. One of Australia’s most respected former public servants, Dennis Richardson, has accused Liberal senator James Paterson of engaging in a “grubby” and “despicable” attempt to blacken his name over comments Paterson made in an interview on Sky News. Thousands of nursing and disability care students across Australia are being prevented from completing clinical placements required to graduate due to pandemic restrictions and the furloughing of senior staff who supervise them. A revolt by a majority of Narrabri shire councillors has bolstered a community push to reroute the inland rail through the region, shining light on the project’s links with Santos and the Morrison government’s “gas-led recovery”. Taxpayer-funded ads exaggerated the federal government’s role in infrastructure projects, while a plan to include former deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, had to be scrapped for breaching advice, an auditor general’s report has revealed. Australians wanting to catch up on ABC television shows will soon need to create a free account and log in to watch programs on its streaming platform iView. Teachers unions are calling on the NSW government to extend the supply of rapid antigen tests for staff and students, saying the program has helped to curb Covid-19 transmission in classrooms. Twitter’s new chief executive, Parag Agrawal, is reportedly taking a “few weeks” off for paternity leave after the birth of his second child, a move that drew cheers from other fathers as a positive step towards normalising men taking time off for childcare. Days before the so-called “Freedom Convoy” reached Ottawa, starting a weeks-long occupation of Canada’s capital and triggering a string of copy-cat blockades, the federal government was warned that violent extremist groups were deeply involved in the protest movement. The use of intrusive spyware by members of the European Union is expected to face new scrutiny following revelations that the mobile phones of two more Polish citizens with close links to an opposition senator were targeted by a client of NSO Group, according to security experts. France and its European partners are to begin a military withdrawal from Mali after more than nine years fighting a jihadist insurgency, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, confirmed on Thursday. As the Game of Thrones star Kit Harington swaps furs for modern dress to play Shakespeare’s Henry V, he reflects on what the play tells us about masculinity, and how it addresses the issues that drove his struggle with addiction. “I see it everywhere,” says Harington, who has given “toxic masculinity” a lot of thought over the years, even if he bristles at the phrase, not least because of the roles he has played. “I see confused men walking the streets. I see terrible role models. I see a lot of anger, and I think we need to start dealing with that anger – we as men, but we as a society as well.” Merilyn Saunders loved sport, music, dressing up and, most of all, her family. The Melbourne grandmother died alone after contracting Covid in her aged care facility in January. Her family believe she was more vulnerable to the disease because she was nursing a broken heart after the death of her daughter. A mother to three children and grandmother to six, it’s unlikely Saunders, 79, would have been in aged care if it weren’t for the shock death of her daughter, says her brother, Colin Hughes. In this latest Lives Lost to Covid, her family remember her. Mazar-i-Sherif was once the most secular and liberal of Afghan cities. But 20 years of corruption and misrule left it ripe for retaking by the Taliban. Will anything be different this time? For years there’s been a global discussion about falling trust in the media, governments and the democratic process. Australia has often been thought of as isolated from these problems but, as we head into the upcoming federal election, we are seeing increasing evidence a lack of trust is permeating society. Lucy Clark talks to Lenore Taylor and Gabrielle Chan about how we can repel these threats to Australia’s democracy.

2/18/2022,"Long before full-time, debate was under way regarding where this sits in an all-time table of one-off results for Scottish teams in European competition. Success for Rangers against Borussia Dortmund is at least a valid part of the discussion. The Rangers contingent inside Signal Iduna Park not only – and quite rightly – partied but realised this was an extraordinary occasion as will be spoken about for some time. Far from stealing victory, the Scottish champions were fully deserving of it; including by the two-goal margin. In fact, there may even be a tiny element of frustration for Giovanni van Bronckhorst that Rangers do not have more leeway ahead of leg two. Rangers will rue the scrapping of the away goals rule. Dortmund of course have the talent to turn this tie on its head next week in Glasgow. Erling Haaland, who missed this defeat through injury, could be back by then. Still, Rangers clearly harbour no sense of trepidation whatsoever. The spotting of glaring weakness in the Dortmund defence is one thing, capitalising on it in the manner Rangers did here quite another.  When Jude Bellingham curled a fine shot beyond Allan McGregor to reduce the Dortmund arrears to two goals, at 3-1, there was a lingering sense the Germans may complete their comeback and restore a sense of natural order. Rangers were having none of that. Alfredo Morelos, who tormented the home back line all evening, strode forward to restore Rangers’ three-goal lead. The final goal – of six – in the game belonged to Dortmund’s Raphaël Guerreiro, which changes the complexion of the tie ever so slightly. Rangers, though, must have belief they can puncture Dortmund’s back line when roared on by a capacity Ibrox crowd. An indication that this may be Rangers’ evening arrived within 10 minutes. When played in by the outstanding Ryan Kent, Borna Barisic lacked conviction with a shot as was saved by Gregor Kobel. The opportunity endorsed the visitors’ confidence touch. Minor panic, but only that, followed for Van Bronckhorst. Dan Axel-Zagadou had a simple task to head Dortmund in front from a corner but instead fluffed his lines. Bellingham soon flashed a pass across McGregor’s six-yard line as found no takers. That was as good as the first half got for Marco Rose’s team, who were jeered off at the interval. By that stage, a James Tavernier penalty and a Morelos tap-in had sent Rangers on course for victory. Axel-Zagadou’s miserable evening continued when VAR correctly penalised him for handball. Tavernier, as is customary, did the rest from 12 yards. It was the Rangers captain’s corner, flicked on by Joe Aribo, that Morelos bashed home. The pick of Rangers’ goals belonged to John Lundstram. The midfielder bent a shot out of Kobel’s reach from 22 yards after Kent laid the ball back into his path. At 3-0, Rangers were in dreamland. Bellingham, one of precious few Dortmund players who emerged with credit, duly had his say. Undeterred, Morelos survived a VAR check before celebrating a fourth. Zagadou was again involved, having deflected the ball on its way into the net. Dortmund had now, extraordinarily, conceded nine goals in two home outings. It could have been 10, Aribo’s shot instead flying narrowly wide. The only problem for Rangers at this stage was that more than half an hour remained. Indeed, Dortmund claimed an element of salvation with a long-range Guerreiro effort. This affords the Germans second leg hope. Based on this evidence, however, they cannot have much; the home support’s disgust towards their team was plain at full time. Haste ye back, Erling.",Sport/Football,Rangers dismantle stunned Borussia Dortmund to make it night to remember,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/17/borussia-dortmund-rangers-europa-league-match-report
2/18/2022,"Amultimillionaire DJ and her husband were last year forced to hand £4m to the National Crime Agency (NCA) after admitting in a settlement that they had brought the money into the UK illegally through a $2.9bn (£2.1bn) money-laundering scheme nicknamed the “Azerbaijani laundromat”. Izzat Khanim Javadova, who performs in London and Ibiza as DJ Mikaela Jav, and her husband, Suleyman Javadov, entered the UK years earlier after investing at least £2m under the “golden visa” scheme that has attracted thousands of wealthy people from Russia and former Soviet states to settle in Britain. Most moved to London, nicknamed “Londongrad” in some circles.  Javadova, a cousin of the Azerbaijani president, Ilham Aliyev, and a daughter of a former Azerbaijani MP, was granted a “tier 1 investor visa” during a “blind faith period” between 2008 and 2015, when 97% of investors were subject to scant checks on the legitimacy of their wealth. More than 3,000 people were granted investor visas during this period, including 705 Russians. They include: ● Zamira Hajiyeva, whose husband was the former chair of Azerbaijan’s state bank, who was served with the UK’s first unexplained wealth order after being found to have spent £1m a year at Harrods. Law enforcers alleged the money came from her husband Jahangir, who was sentenced to 15 years in jail in Azerbaijan. ● Nirav Modi, an Indian billionaire awaiting extradition over an accusation of defrauding a state-owned bank of £1.5bn. ● Mukhtar Ablyazov, the son of a former energy minister in Kazakhstan, accused of embezzling $5bn (£4bn) from a state bank and lying to a court about the scale of his vast fortune, including a £17m mansion on The Bishops Avenue in London. After the 2018 Salisbury poisonings of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, a former Russian military officer and his daughter, the government launched a review into the investors awarded visas from 2008-2015. The review has yet to be published. Meanwhile, new investors continued to take advantage of the visa system. The latest Home Office data shows 798 investor visas were granted in the year to September 2021, of which 82 were award to Russians – the highest 12-month total since 2018. The scheme remained open, despite parliament’s joint intelligence and security committee saying in 2020 that it was “welcoming oligarchs with open arms”. “It offered ideal mechanisms by which illicit finance could be recycled through what has been referred to as the London ‘laundromat’,” it said. “Russian influence in the UK is ‘the new normal’, and there are a lot of Russians with very close links to Putin who are well integrated into the UK business and social scene, and accepted because of their wealth. This level of integration – in ‘Londongrad’ in particular – means that any measures now being taken by the government are not preventative but rather constitute damage limitation.” Chris Bryant, a Labour MP who sits on the foreign affairs select committee, said the UK “remains the soft underbelly for dodgy Russian money” and the investor visa programme had been a “gold-plated invite to launder money in the UK”. The Home Office announced on Thursday that the scheme would end with immediate effect. Bryant said the UK had become addicted to “dodgy money”, and questioned why Priti Patel, the home secretary, had not ended the scheme sooner, saying she was on the foreign affairs committee when it recommended closing it. The scheme was launched by the Labour government after the 2008 global financial crisis to raise investment. A £2m investment allowed an application within five years, decreasing to three years with £5m, or to two years with £10m. Prem Sikka, emeritus professor of accounting at the University of Essex and a Labour member of the House of Lords, said: “The City is hooked on dirty money.

2/18/2022,"Britain believes that nearly half of Russian forces that have massed near Ukraine are now within 30 miles of the border, in contrast to statements from Moscow that its forces were being sent back to barracks. Reinforcements from 14 battalions were in the process of arriving, officials added, while highlighting a pontoon bridge that had been briefly set up in Belarus in the past few days as an example of unusual military activity.  There was evidence, a defence source said, “of Russian forces leaving the deployment sites for staging areas closer to the border”. A couple of hours later, the US president, Joe Biden, warned that an attack could take place “in the next several days”. Russia has repeatedly said it has no intention of invading Ukraine and on Tuesday announced a drawdown of troops from Crimea, accompanied by videos of tanks being loaded on to transport trains. But the UK – in conjunction with the US – stepped up its warnings on Thursday. The pontoon bridge, revealed in satellite imagery, was built five miles from Ukraine’s borders across the Pripyat river in the Chernobyl reactor exclusion zone as part of ongoing joint exercises in Belarus between Russia and its neighbour. Ukraine is crisscrossed with rivers, which has been highlighted as a possible hindrance to any potential Russian ground invasion unless they used pontoon bridges. Images from Wednesday, highlighted by the defence analyst group Jane’s, showed that the bridge had been taken down. But officials said of its construction: “This activity is highly unusual and inconsistent with any past exercise.” As part of the growing public relations efforts, the UK’s Ministry of Defence also released a short video saying that it had seen “no evidence that Russian forces are withdrawing from Ukrainian border regions”, with a map showing a possible invasion on multiple axes. The video warned: “Defence intelligence assesses that he [Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin] would be willing to sustain thousands of casualties to get what he wants.” However, analysts from the International Institute for Strategic Studies questioned this week whether Russia had the capacity to carry out such a wide-ranging invasion as the video suggested. John Chipman, the chief executive of the thinktank, said on Wednesday that should Russia decide to attack, “there’s probably enough combat mass now present to conduct a more limited ground operation, perhaps to seize Ukraine eastern regions”. A key moment could come on Friday. The president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, said he would meet Putin that day to decide whether Moscow’s forces would remain in Belarus after 20 February, when the joint exercises were due to conclude. Previously, both countries had said Russian forces would depart on that date. Over the past 24 hours, independent experts have become increasingly sceptical that Russian forces are moving significantly away from the border areas, although it can take time for open-source satellite imagery or other video to emerge. Thomas Bullock, a senior open-source analyst from Jane’s, said that it “looks like the equipment is actually being moved to positions closer to the border … there’s nothing to really indicate otherwise”. The videos released by Russia’s Ministry of Defence, Bullock said, were heavily edited and sometimes appeared to combine clips of tanks both arriving to and leaving the rail station, making it unclear whether the armour had really been withdrawn. “It’s a bit misleading really,” he added. “If you wanted a consistent narrative you’d just show the tanks driving to the train station. Instead, they show them going there, they come back, they’re going again. It seems a bit all over the place.” Footage published by the Russian government had shown elements of the 136th Motorised Rifle Brigade and 42nd Motorised Rifle Division of the 58th Army, both deployed to Crimea, boarding railcars that the Russian defence ministry indicated were bound for their permanent bases in mainland Russia. Western defence sources said they would be sceptical unless they saw evidence of forces, some of whom have deployed across Russia, returning to their bases with heavy equipment. After a smaller buildup last spring, thousands of troops remained near Ukraine, rather than going home. The Russian newspaper Izvestia, which has good sources in the defence ministry, also reported that the 3rd and 150th Motorized Rifle Divisions were returning to their garrisons as part of the drawdown. But, as analysts noted, their permanent bases are located in Valyuki, a base just over 9 miles from Ukraine, and in Rostov region just 25 miles from the border. “Best guess is we will see a deployment shell game,” wrote Michael Kofman, a research programme director in the Russia studies programme at the US research centre CNA. “Units redeploying around Ukraine without altering the overall picture. Some BTGs [battalion tactical groups] leaving Crimea, but even more still arriving elsewhere.” More powerful Russian units such as the 1st Guards Tank Army had been identified moving to positions as close as 19 miles from the border this week, Bullock said, “tearing up streets” in small villages as they drove to positions within striking distance of the border.",News/World news,Britain steps up Ukraine warnings despite assurance from Moscow,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/17/russian-forces-closer-ukraine-border-uk-sources
2/18/2022,"Hikaru Nakamura defeated Levon Aronian 3-1 in the all-American Fide Grand Prix first leg final at Berlin on Thursday as the five-time US champion, who has become a Twitch stremer with more than a million followers, showed his speed skills by winning both 15-minute rapids after two classical games were drawn. Nakamura needed a wildcard from the Fide president to compete in Berlin, and that decision drew sharp criticism from Arkady Dvorkovich’s Russian compatriots, but his games were full of energy and ideas. The decisive final encounter was level until Aronian, needing a win to stay in the match, advanced his white king too far into the black camp where it was trapped by Nakamura’s rooks.  This was the first leg (of three) of the Grand Prix, which qualifies its top two finishers to the eight-player Candidates at Madrid in June, the event which will decide the 2023 challenger for Magnus Carlsen’s world crown. There has been tension between Aronian and Nakamura dating back to a touch-move incident at Moscow 2016, but the former Armenian, 39, and the 34-year-old, who has popularised chess to huge online audiences, are now both well placed. They will miss the Grand Prix second leg starting in Belgrade on 28 February before returning for the final leg in Berlin on 21 March. In contrast, the quintet of Russians who failed to get past the group stage all face elimination. The only US casualty who did not reach at least the semi-final in Berlin was Wesley So, and the former Filipino was knocked out by a compatriot. Leinier Domínguez found White’s winning move in the diagram with seconds to spare, avoiding a plausible but losing alternative, Can you do as well? Aronian, Domínguez, and Carlsen’s 2018 challenger, Fabiano Caruana, are all residents of St Louis, which has become a global chess centre with backing from the billionaire Rex Sinquefield. St Louis has a chess Hall of Fame, a chess club open nine hours a day, and the world’s largest chess piece, a 20ft high king. Sinquefield’s other ambition was to create a group of top grandmasters, through a mixture of home talent and transfers, capable of winning the biennial 150-nation Olympiad. That target has already been fulfilled, as the US won gold in 2016, were an unlucky second to China in 2018, and will again be favourites at the next Olympiad in Moscow in July. The Grand Prix action now moves to Belgrade, where the favourites are Anish Giri, the Netherlands world No 9, Shak Mamedyarov, Azerbaijan’s world No 7, and Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, France’s world No 11. The last two are both in the same Belgrade preliminary group, already styled the “Group of Death”. China’s world No 3, Ding Liren, withdrew from both Berlin and Belgrade and is thus out of contention. What has happened to him raises the question whether Chinese sports officials have quietly downgraded their achievement targets. International chess, as opposed to the Chinese version which is much more generally popular, has only been taken seriously by Beijing since the 1970s. Chinese teams have been regular winners of the women’s Olympiad, won gold at the open Olympiad in 2014, and then, at Batumi 2018, won both Olympiad titles, the first nation to achieve the double since the Soviet Union in 1986. Success at Batumi was generally expected to lead to a still stronger Chinese campaign to create a challenger for Carlsen’s individual global title. It seemed that this would be spearheaded by Ding, but the 29-year-old, who should be at the peak of his powers, has just missed a major opportunity There are suggestions that Ding left it too late to apply for a visa for Berlin, then decided he had little chance to do well in Belgrade and gain a place in the final leg via a withdrawal. In contrast, China’s No 2, Yu Yangyi, has played in the World Cup and the Grand Swiss, and is also in the field for Belgrade. The obvious solution for Ding is to establish a second home in Europe from where it would be much easier to commute to major tournaments, Aronian, when still an Armenian, had a base in Berlin, while both India’s Vishy Anand and Bulgaria’s Veselin Topalov operated from Spain in their peak years. A wider concern is that Beijing sports officials may have made a policy decision to downgrade their chess ambitions and to consider the 2018 double Olympiad gold as sufficient fulfilment, tacitly abandoning any further campaign to support Ding towards the individual world top. Perhaps they have concluded that Carlsen is too strong to dethrone. Carlsen himself will be back in action on Saturday in the Airthings Masters, the opening event of the online Meltwater Champions Tour. Games start at 5pm, and Carlsen’s four opponents that day in order will be Russia’s Vladislav Artemiev, the 17-year-old world rapid champion, Nodirbek Abdusattorov, Russia’s rising star Andrey Esipenko, 19, and the defeated 2021 challenger, Ian Nepomniachtchi. 3803: 1...Qf2! threatens 2...Rxh3+! 3 Kxh3 Qh4 mate.

2/18/2022,"Simone Inzaghi tried to remain upbeat throughout his post-match press conference but, in keeping with Internazionale’s entire night against Liverpool at San Siro, a positive performance came with a sting at the end. Inter’s coach described their display as “probably our best game of the season” considering they were facing “one of the best teams in Europe” and stated several times that he was proud of the Italian champions’ tireless shift. Only the fine margins had gone against them, he continued, with Roberto Firmino’s glancing 75th-minute header the decisive detail. And then came the sting, or perhaps just the reality.  “We don’t have much hope now,” Inzaghi admitted. It has been drained by Liverpool’s ruthlessness, their set-piece prowess, the impact of Jürgen Klopp’s high-calibre substitutes and the commanding partnership of Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konaté in the heart of the visitors’ defence. The growing understanding between the pair provided a platform for Liverpool’s late victory and Inter’s understandable lament. It seems a statistical error that, after an open and hugely entertaining game in which Ivan Perisic wreaked havoc down Liverpool’s right for a sustained spell after half-time, neither Alisson nor his Inter counterpart Samir Handanovic made a save between them. Liverpool scored with their two attempts on target, from 12 overall, while the hosts failed to find the target from nine attempts. The determined, organised and intelligent defending in front of Alisson had a greater influence on his clean sheet than any profligacy on Inter’s part. Wednesday was only the eighth time that Van Dijk and Konaté have started together since the latter’s £36m arrival from RB Leipzig last summer. Their partnership is at the fledgling stage and to lavish it with praise is not to undermine Joël Matip’s continued claims as the polished, often unsung foil to Van Dijk. Matip has much more to contribute than smacking his teammates’ heads while they celebrated Firmino’s goal at San Siro, and receiving a deathly stare back from Jordan Henderson for his troubles. But Konaté and Van Dijk complemented each other superbly in the last-16 first leg in Milan, dealing with the physical threat of Edin Dzeko, stifling Lautaro Martínez throughout and curbing Perisic’s probing crosses with countless interceptions. Van Dijk, having worked his way back to imperious form, gave the 22-year-old Konaté licence to defend impressively on the front foot in the safe knowledge his back was covered. They were dominant against Inter’s set pieces – in contrast to their opposite numbers in the decisive closing stage – and Dzeko’s pained expression when clean through on the stroke of half-time, only for Van Dijk to cruise past and roll the ball back to Alisson, encapsulated Inter’s torment in front of goal. That recurring dream of running nowhere fast was played out in real time by Dzeko. Klopp has adopted a careful integration policy with his summer signing, similar in some respects to Andy Robertson’s first season as a Liverpool player, but Konaté is pressing his claims for a more regular role with every start. Liverpool’s season is brimming with the expectation and hope that disappeared from Inter in Milan.",Sport/Football,Konaté growing into Liverpool role and partnership with Van Dijk | Andy Hunter,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/17/ibrahima-konate-liverpool-inter-virgil-van-dijk
