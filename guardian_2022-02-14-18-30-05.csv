2/14/2022,"Police have been ordered to reinvestigate a complaint from Caroline Flack’s mother that her daughter’s fame had influenced the decision to charge her daughter with assault. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) has instructed the Metropolitan police (MPS) to reinvestigate whether Flack was treated differently because of her fame when she was charged with assault rather than receiving a caution, which prosecutors had initially indicated would be the preferred course of action.  The Love Island presenter took her own life at the age of 40 in February 2020 after learning prosecutors would press ahead with the charge over an incident involving her boyfriend, Lewis Burton. Her mother, Christine Flack, told the BBC she still wanted to know why her daughter had been charged with the assault. “I just want those answers to make me feel better and to make me know that I’ve done the right thing by Caroline,” she said. “It leaves us really sad and really angry because we want to know why they charged her. I just want the truth out there. I know it won’t bring her back but I’ve got to do it for her.” Asked if she felt the decision to charge her daughter had contributed to her death, Flack said: “Oh, totally. Totally. She couldn’t see a way out.” She said as a result she had lost trust in the police: “There’s no trust at all. No trust at all. I just want the truth out there.” Flack found out the day before her death that she would be prosecuted with the charge that she hit Burton with her phone while he slept, over concerns he had been cheating on her. Friends said she was expecting the case to be dropped after her lawyers applied for it to be thrown out. The coroner, Mary Hassell, found that Flack had killed herself because she knew she was being prosecuted and could not face the press coverage. Flack’s mother had accused the police and prosecutors of having it “in for” her daughter, accusing them of taking her to court due to her “celebrity status”. The MPS spokesperson said: “Following a review, the IOPC agreed with the MPS that service was acceptable in relation to seven areas of the complaints relating to the response and handling of the incident by the MPS. “The IOPC has directed the MPS to reinvestigate one element of the complaints. This relates to the process involved in appealing the CPS decision to caution Ms Flack. We will re-examine this element of the investigative process. Our thoughts and sympathies remain with Caroline’s family.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

2/14/2022,"Ivan Reitman was a director and producer with a golden touch for Hollywood comedy and feelgood entertainment – the heir, perhaps, of Ernst Lubitsch or Gregory La Cava from the golden age, but with a multiplex talent for the 80s and 90s – able to detonate serious box-office explosions. His great heyday, importantly, coincided with the great heyday of video rental and home entertainment – an era of couples and families browsing the VHS racks at video rental stores on a Friday and Saturday night and deciding that comedies were the best bet: Reitman’s comedies. And this, most famously, was for the glorious high-concept fantasy comedy Ghostbusters in 1984, which brilliantly absorbed SNL-type comedy into the movie mainstream and made stars and serious players of its leads: Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis. I have a happy memory of Ivan Reitman appearing on stage in London just last year, to deafening applause, joining his son Jason before the premiere of the newest film in what became the Ghostbusters franchise: Ghostbusters Afterlife.  Reitman was able to hyper-evolve a comedy style which started in the wacky, boisterous, non-PC style of the frat house – there was his Canadian debut Meatballs (which was also Bill Murray’s acting debut) and the army comedy Stripes (again Murray, developing his miraculously laidback droll style). Before this, Reitman had produced National Lampoon’s Animal House, a movie that showed what a huge mainstream market there was for goofy, borderline-crass guys’ comedy. Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters II took him to the stratosphere: an effects-laden spectacular with the heft and power of a big sci-fi or action movie – but a comedy with cool, even subtle performances. The same can’t exactly be said for his other directing coup, but it showed his pure Hollywood genius: realising the family comedy potential of Arnold Schwarzenegger in movies such as Twins and Kindergarten Cop. Those movies put Arnie’s muscular power and box office chops at the service of Reitman’s inspired talent for popular comedy. He was a titan of showbusiness and a master of the impossible task of making people laugh.",Arts/Film,Ghostbusters director Ivan Reitman: Hollywood’s master of multiplex comedy | Peter Bradshaw ,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/14/ivan-reitman-death-hollywood-multiplex-comedy-ghostbusters
2/14/2022,"Europe is closer to war than at any point over the past 70 years, a UK government minister has warned, as Russian troops amass on the borders of Ukraine and western leaders warn that an invasion could take place early this week. The armed forces minister James Heappey told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme he feared “we are closer than we’ve been on this continent” to war “for 70 years”.  He said: “There’s 130,000 Russian troops around the borders of Ukraine, thousands more on amphibious shipping in the Black Sea and the Azov Sea. “All of the combat enablers are in place and my fear is that if all of this was just about a show to win leverage in diplomacy that doesn’t require the logistics, the fuel, the medical supplies, the bridging assets, the unglamorous stuff that actually makes an invasion force credible, but doesn’t attract headlines. Yet all of that is now in place too.” Western leaders are mounting a final effort to negotiate diplomatic solutions after US intelligence said an attack could be imminent. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, will travel to Kyiv for talks with Ukrainian officials and Boris Johnson said he would hold further talks with world leaders to bring Russia “back from the brink” of war. His office did not say which world leaders Johnson was hoping to talk to or where he planned to travel, but it is understood he is keen to engage with Nordic and Baltic countries. The Foreign Office has asked British citizens to leave the country while roads are still open and commercial airlines are still flying. Heappey said there was “real urgency” to ongoing negotiations.He said: “That is why this is a very serious time for the whole world, really, to come together and to send a message to Russia that this is behaviour that will not be accepted and that we stand behind Ukraine, and that the financial sanctions if he were to cross the border would be absolutely profound.”In an interview with BBC Breakfast, Heappey said that although he could not comment on whether parliament would be recalled from recess this week as this was a decision for the Speaker, the prime minister and opposition party leaders, if it happened it would offer an opportunity for MPs to show the UK’s resolve that if Russia crossed the border into Ukraine, it would encounter more than “febrile tactical responses”. He said: “We’re entering into a period of sustained, strategic competition with Russia, in which we need to make sure that Putin’s wider aims beyond any territorial aim he may have in Ukraine, but his wider aims about Russia’s role in the world, his wider aims around constraining Nato, that he fails to achieve those and that Nato shows its resolve within its own borders.”",News/World news,"Europe closer to war than at any point in 70 years, fears UK minister",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/14/ukraine-russia-europe-closer-to-war-than-at-any-point-in-70-years-fears-uk-minister
2/14/2022,"The scheduling was surely not a coincidence as the ice dancing pairs served up some much needed Valentine’s Day cheer at the Capital Indoor Stadium in Beijing, on a day figure skating was overshadowed by the Kamila Valieva case. The gold medal, won with a world record score of 226.98, went to France’s Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron, who danced to Gabriel Fauré’s Élégie. That also added a redemptive twist to the competition. In 2018 they became breakout social media stars of the Pyeongchang Games in South Korea for all the wrong reasons.  At the last Olympics a wardrobe malfunction left Papadakis falling out of her dress on the ice while the skaters tried to execute their short dance. “I felt it right away and I prayed,” she said at the time. “It was pretty distracting, kind of my worst nightmare happening at the Olympics.” After that mishap the French dancers ultimately missed out on winning in 2018, despite setting a world record score in their other routine, and had to settle for silver, losing by less than a point to the Canadian duo of Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir. Since then Papadakis and Cizeron have gone on to dominate ice dancing, and they went into Monday’s session with a commanding lead. The British pair Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson finished in 10th place with a combined score of 191.64. Ice dancing is surely the most sensual of Olympic disciplines, with many of the pairings appearing through the years being couples on and off the ice. Though not every dancing pair in Beijing are romantically entangled. Indeed, from the winning pair, Cizeron is openly gay, and in October 2021 the International Skating Union had to investigate an allegation of homophobic comments made about him by a Russian coach at a tournament. This year the Czech Republic have sent Natalie Taschlerova and Filip Taschler to the Winter Games – a pairing of siblings who consequently dance in a slightly different style to the close entwinements often seen on the ice. Japan’s husband and wife duo of Tim Koleto and Misato Komatsubara missed out on a Valentine’s Day Olympic ice dance as they finished 22nd in Saturday’s rhythm dance session, meaning they did not qualify for Monday’s medal stage. And maybe being in a relationship isn’t an advantage anyway. Evan Bates and Madison Chock of the US danced for years before becoming a couple off the ice, and despite an intimate routine early on Monday in Beijing they finished just outside the medals in a frustrating fourth place. They had performed an avant-garde intergalactic space love story set to the electronic tones of Daft Punk. Above them in third were US teammates Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue, who used to be an a relationship, but ended it two-and-a-half years ago, while continuing to compete together. They had picked perhaps a more conventional love theme with Anne Sila’s 2016 piano-driven ballad Drowning as their soundtrack. The bronze medallists kissed the ice as they left an Olympic competition for the last time. “It was just a moment, I think, for both of us to say goodbye to Olympic ice,” Hubbell said, “and thank this journey that’s created, you know, the people that we are today.” They are both retiring and intend to go into coaching – separately. The silver medal went to Victoria Sinitsina and Nikita Katsalapov of the Russian Olympic Committee. But if there was a prize for the most appropriate music choice for the day, it would surely have gone to Ukraine’s Oleksandra Mazarove and Maksym Nikitin as they danced to the song Backstage Romance from the soundtrack to Moulin Rouge. Every Winter Olympic Games since Innsbruck in 1976 has fallen in the calendar in such a way that it includes 14 February. But maybe nothing will be more tailored to Valentine’s Day than the special trousers that Norway’s curlers wore for the occasion in Pyeongchang four years ago.",Sport/Sport,Golden redemption for Papadakis and Cizeron in Valentine’s Day ice dancing | Martin Belam,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/14/golden-redemption-for-papadakis-and-cizeron-in-valentines-day-ice-dancing
2/14/2022,"In late August last year, four inmates at the Washington county detention center in north-west Arkansas contracted Covid-19. In the days that followed, the four men were relocated to a quarantine block in the prison. In the block, the inmates were given a cocktail of drugs. They soon began to suffer a series of side effects including vision issues, diarrhea, bloody stools and stomach cramps.  It was only later that they discovered they had been prescribed, without their consent, significantly high doses of ivermectin, an anti-parasitic drug commonly used on livestock animals including cows and horses. The story of what may have happened in a small slice of Arkansas nestled against the Ozark hills has shocked many in America and come to symbolize the political divides triggered by the pandemic. The scheme reflects a growing obsession with ivermectin as a Covid-19 treatment – especially among rightwing communities in the US. But it also repeats America’s dreadful history of racism as the alleged experimentation forced on the Arkansas inmates recalls a grisly history of medical exploitation by American authorities towards communities and inmates of color. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as well as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have warned against using ivermectin for Covid-19. Despite that the treatment has gained wide popularity among many on the right, including anti-vaxxers. Last month, the Arkansas chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit on behalf of the men against Washington county jail, the Washington county sheriff, Tim Helder, and jail physician Dr Robert Karas. One of the plaintiffs was recorded as 6ft 1in and weighed 158 lbs (71.6kg) on 22 August 2021. At his size, the approved ivermectin dosage to treat worms is 0.2 mg/kg in a single dose, which given his size, is 14 mg. According to the lawsuit, he was given 48 mg over four days, 3.4 times the approved dosage. Another plaintiff, who has a history of heart conditions and suffered three heart attacks in 2018, was recorded as 6ft 1in and weighed 191 lbs (86.6 kg) on 21 August 2021. The approved ivermectin dosage to combat worms for someone his size is 0.2 mg/kg in a single dose, or 17 mg. He was prescribed 36 mg of the drug on 22 August, followed by 24 mg daily from 23-25 August. The total dosage, 108 mg, was nearly 6.3 times the approved dosage. At the time, the plaintiffs were told that the treatments merely consisted of “vitamins”, “antibiotics” and “steroids”, according to the lawsuit. The FDA has warned against using ivermectin to treat Covid-19. The agency’s listed side effects of ivermectin overdose include nausea, diarrhea, low blood pressure, allergic reactions such as itching and hives, seizures, coma and even death. “No one – including incarcerated individuals – should be deceived and subject to medical experimentation,” said Gary Sullivan, legal director of the ACLU of Arkansas. Despite the widespread outrage at the allegations, last week some local Arkansas officials praised Karas for a “job well done”, despite widespread outrage against his actions. “Dr Robert Karas and Karas Correctional Health have effectively treated … cases [in the jail] which have resulted in zero fatalities from the virus,” said a resolution recently passed by a local court’s jail and enforcement committee. The exploitation faced by the Arkansas inmates reflects America’s longstanding history of medically abusing vulnerable communities of color, including inmates. From 1946 to 1948, the US Public Health Service (USPHS) and the Pan American Sanitary Bureau worked alongside multiple Guatemalan agencies on medical research funded by the American government. The research involved deliberately exposing Guatemalans, including soldiers, prisoners, prostitutes and mental patients with syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases. In two years, over 1,300 people were exposed to syphilis, gonorrhea or chancroid. In 2011, the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues revealed that only around 700 of those infected received some form of treatment while 83 others died. According to details that only emerged 10 years ago, one of the researchers, John Charles Cutler, injected gonorrhea and syphilis bacteria into the eyes of patients, often in the form of pus. In one study, he infected prostitutes with gonorrhea by inserting a cotton swab carrying the bacteria into their vaginas with “considerable vigor”. Cutler then ordered the prostitutes to have sex with the men he wanted to study, including prisoners and army members. Other researchers scraped men’s penises with needles and then applied syphilitic material around the abrasions. At times, women were subjected to injections of infected pus into their spinal cords. According to experts, the research came up with no useful medical information and was instead concealed for decades until a Wellesley College medical historian uncovered the medical records among Cutler’s papers. Cutler then went on to become a primary researcher in the later half of the infamous Tuskegee syphilis experiment. Starting in 1932 and continuing for 40 years, American government officials in rural Alabama withheld treatment from unsuspecting Black men infected with syphilis so doctors could monitor the disease and dissect their bodies when they died. The study was fueled by harmful pseudoscientific and racist beliefs, including ones that assumed that African Americans had under-developed brains and over-developed genitals. Researchers also believed that Black people were significantly prone to sexually transmitted disease and that all Black people could not be convinced to receive treatment for syphilis. As a result, the experiments, which involved 600 Black men, became known as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study. The USPHS called the research a “study in nature” rather than an experiment, meant to merely monitor the progression of syphilis in a community that allegedly refused to seek treatment. The men were mostly sharecroppers and many had never visited a doctor. Doctors from the USPHS told them that they were being treated for bad blood, a general term used at the time to refer to a variety of diseases. In exchange for their participation, the men received free medical exams, free meals and burial insurance. Many of them died, went blind or insane. Cutler later said in a 1993 documentary, “It was important that they were supposedly untreated and it would be undesirable to go ahead and use large amounts of penicillin to treat the disease, because you’d interfere with the study.” Similarly, from the 1950s to 1970s, inmates in Philadelphia’s Holmesburg Prison, many of whom were Black, were subject to a series of medical experiments. In conjunction with the University of Pennsylvania, doctors and prison officials experimented on hundreds of prisoners for nearly two decades. Prisoners were used to test products for facial creams, perfumes, detergents and anti-rash treatments. Others were subject to experiments that involved far more hazardous substances, including radioactive isotopes, LSD, chemical warfare agents and dioxins, a highly toxic group of chemical compounds often used to bleach paper pulp and manufacture pesticides. One inmate said he was paid $10 to be injected with a “rare disease from India,” and was paid an additional $5 when he developed an abscess. In 2018, the dean of Penn Medicine issued an apology for the experiments, saying that the “work done … was terribly disrespectful of individuals – many of whom were imprisoned Black men – denying them the autonomy and informed consent which the medical community now considers to be foundational underpinnings for conducting ethical research.” Fast forward to present day, since ACLU’s lawsuit against Dr Robert Karas and the Washington county jail, Karas has filed a motion to dismiss ACLU’s lawsuit against him. Karas’s actions encapsulate not only the horrific history of the carceral system in the American south, but also the continued exploitation of vulnerable communities, including inmates of color. As one inmate said receiving news about the ivermectin treatments, “I’m scared. If you were so willing to put something in my pills and give me a pill without my acknowledgement, you could do the same thing and be deceptive and put it in my juice, my food … I can’t trust any of the medical staff. I can’t trust any of the guards.”",News/US news,Arkansas jail’s ivermectin experiments recall historical medical abuse of imprisoned minorities,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/14/arkansas-prison-covid-19-ivermectin-experiment-minorities-medical-abuse
2/14/2022,"The green tree dominates the image’s centre, towering over a tangle of highways, which are themselves rendered in shades of dull, newsprint grey. Printed along the bottom in red is a poetic message: Und Neues Leben Blüht aus den Ruinen – “And new life blooms from the ruins.” Created in 1979, this is just one of many anti-car posters created by the German political activist and graphic designer Klaus Staeck. Born in 1938 in the German town of Pulsnitz, north-east of Dresden, Staeck moved to West Germany in 1956. There, he trained as a lawyer and became active in the West German Social Democratic party before teaching himself graphic design.  Beginning in the early 1970s, Staeck created posters that mimicked the iconography and language of political campaigns to poke fun at leaders whose policies, he believed, mainly benefited the wealthy and powerful. Occasionally, the car would become a stand-in for such policies, such as in 1974’s “For wider streets, vote conservative,” which shows a Rolls-Royce driving down a narrow street past modest houses, none of which have driveways. While his work now hangs in museums, his posters were originally plastered on buildings or displayed in store windows; smaller versions were handed to people as flyers and postcards. None of Staeck’s work bears his signature; he believes that having people engage with the central questions he poses in his art has always been more important than identifying the creator behind it. As Staeck said in a 1977 interview: “I have developed a technique that can be used to reach many people who have no interest in politics, but who are nevertheless concerned about inequality, injustice and social problems.” “He calls himself a ‘disturber of comfortable conditions,’” says Juliet Kinchin, a former curator at New York’s Museum of Modern Art, which holds a large collection of Staeck’s posters. “He uses humour and irony to make you laugh and yet your laughter is undercut constantly by the political provocation he offers.” This is certainly true of Staeck’s more blatant anti-car posters, which take the techniques the auto industry uses to sell happy motoring and turns them on their head. Consider, for example, a 1987 poster featuring a car beneath text that reads, “The new 12-cylinder: Our contribution to the general frenzy,” which sharply undercuts the notion that purchasing a luxury sports car benefits anyone, and least of all the society in which it is driven. A 1991 poster showing a sporty red car above text that reads, “This model performs particularly well in traffic jams” accomplishes something similar. That both posters use German-made BMWs to make their points is hardly a coincidence. The car’s threat to safety is highlighted in 1987’s “Car from the perspective of a traffic victim,” in which an automobile’s undercarriage takes up almost the entire poster, presenting the car not as the stuff of motorist fantasies but of pedestrian nightmares. “Right of way for bicycles” (1985) shows a tiny cyclist riding below a gigantic car tire as if to suggest that merely asserting that cyclists have the right of way on public streets is not enough to protect them from harm. When it comes to one of the car’s biggest harms, Staeck also pulls no punches. In “The future belongs to the car” (1984), no vehicle can be seen, just a clearcut forest that represents the auto industry’s pillaging of natural resources to fuel its continued growth. “No freedom without waste” (1979) shows a happy couple standing behind a muscle car as a plane takes off against an ominous burnt-orange sky, as if to say that nothing good can come from rampant consumerism. At 83, Staeck is still creating works that take on the powerful and call attention to the climate crisis. While his anti-car posters are a small fraction of his overall body of work, Kinchin sees them as a natural subject for an artist and provocateur from a country that pinned much of its postwar recovery on manufacturing cars and enabling their use. “The autobahn was, on one level, a signifier of Germany’s postwar economic miracle which, by the 70s, was being questioned everywhere,” she says. Today, with the car’s place in society continuing to be questioned, Staeck’s work remains as relevant as ever. “He’s very aware that this isn’t just a British or German or American issue,” says Kinchin. “It is truly a global debate.”",Arts/Art and design,"Klaus Staeck, the provocative artist who challenged postwar Germany’s love of the car",https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/14/klaus-staeck-the-provocative-artist-who-challenged-postwar-germanys-love-of-the-car
