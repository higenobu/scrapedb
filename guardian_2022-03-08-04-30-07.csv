3/8/2022,"Ramping up production from the UK’s oil and gas fields in the North Sea could help in the short term to ease the pain of high fuel prices but should not be seen as a long-term solution to Britain’s energy woes, experts have warned. Lord Adair Turner, former CBI chief and former chair of the Committee on Climate Change, now chair of the Energy Transitions Commission thinktank, said the prime minister’s plan to produce more oil and gas now marked a sensible move, but he cautioned against those who saw a continued future in increased production. “You have to distinguish between the short term – more gas from existing fields – and the long term,” said Turner. “You would have to be a very furious climate campaigner to say in the middle of a war you could not take measures like that. “So we will probably have to take these short-term measures, like squeezing more from existing fields or importing more LNG [liquefied natural gas, by tanker], but fundamentally we want no new oil and gas [exploration] from the North Sea. The future of the North Sea should be windmills, not oil and gas.” The returns from a push to expand production were likely to be limited, and so the focus should also be on renewable energy, added Bob Ward, policy director of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics. “The UK is already committed to maximum economic recovery of oil and gas from the North Sea, but it is a mature basin with declining production, which is why the UK currently has to import about half of the natural gas that it consumes,” he said. “We can see from history that the price of natural gas and oil is volatile, so the only way to prevent future crises is for the UK to cut its dependence on fossil fuels by deploying alternatives to fossil fuels. To reach net zero, these alternatives need to be clean.” New licensing for North Sea oil and gas fields, which the government is also pursuing, would not produce any more fuel for decades, the Committee on Climate Change warned recently, so would be of no value in increasing production for the current crisis and would only leave stranded assets for the future. The CCC said it “favoured” an end to new licences but barring the government from granting licences was beyond its remit. Some commentators, particularly some on the right of the Tory party, have also called for more fracking as a solution to high energy prices. However, even if the local objections to fracking could be overcome, it would take years to produce any gas in the UK. Modern fracking techniques were first tried in the UK over a decade ago by Cuadrilla, but it was soon forced to stop owing to earth tremors. The Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy has said no fracking could be resumed unless this issue was resolved. A spokesperson said: “The UK has no issue with gas supply, and unlike other countries in Europe, the UK is in no way dependent on Russian gas, with imports making up just 4% of demand. “Fracking would have no effect on domestic energy prices in the near term. To boost energy security, we need to move away from expensive fossil fuels and generate more cheap, clean and secure power in the UK.” Fracking would also require the industrialisation of swathes of the UK countryside. Rob Gross, director of the UK Energy Research Centre, said: “As an immediate response to events in Ukraine, fracking cannot provide a solution because it will take several years for prospective sites to become operational. “In the longer term, fracking could improve our energy independence but that would not change the fact that the price of gas is set on international markets.” If the UK wants to stop importing gas by next winter, that would be theoretically possible if every home were made energy efficient, according to calculations by Jan Rosenow, director of the Regulatory Assistance Project. He said: “We import about 150 TWh of gas for home heating every year. None of this would be needed if we insulated our homes and switched to heat pumps. “We could save more gas than we import for heating with existing technologies. What is needed is the government to step up its policies now to roll out insulation and deploy heat pumps as quickly as possible.” Rebecca Newsom, head of politics for Greenpeace UK, also warned against cutting government support for renewable energy in an effort to reduce bills, pointing out that this had backfired in the past because the levies funded insulation and other efficiency and low-carbon measures that were abandoned. “We have already seen what happens when, in David Cameron’s infamous words, ministers ‘cut the green crap’ – UK energy bills are now £2.5bn higher thanks to that. Our gas-guzzling homes are funding Putin’s war, hurting our pockets as gas prices soar and wrecking the climate,” she warned. “This is the price we pay for decades of government failure to end our dependence on fossil fuels. Our best hope for a safer, healthier, peaceful future is in moving away from oil and gas as quickly as possible and investing in clean energy and warmer homes.”",News/Environment,"Don’t let high energy prices derail UK green agenda, say climate experts",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/07/dont-let-high-energy-prices-derail-uk-green-agenda-say-climate-experts
3/8/2022,"Ukrainians attempting to flee to safety in the UK have described intense frustration and anger at the bureaucratic hurdles and technical difficulties involved in securing a visa under the new Ukrainian family scheme. Numerous applicants said they were stuck in unfamiliar countries on the border with Ukraine, unable to come to the UK because they were wrestling with the complex application process. Some said they were having difficulties uploading crucial documentsor the application website was crashing, others said there were no available appointment slots to finalise their applications, or they were dismayed to be asked to post supporting documents to an office in Wandsworth. Families in the UK who are trying to help relatives make their way to Britain said they were confused by the complexity of the visa form. “I understand they are under pressure with many applications, but the system is not flexible. This is a humanitarian crisis,” a British citizen, who asked not to be named, said, as she struggled to submit a visa application for her aunt and 14-year-old cousin who have fled Kyiv and are currently in Romania. An apparent glitch in the system meant she was unable to upload documents proving the family connection, and received an email telling her she should post supporting documents to an address in Wandsworth, along with a fee of £75 per application (or £100 for a priority service) for the documents to be scanned. When she called the Home Office hotline on Sunday, staff said they were aware of an issue with uploading documents. “I’m furious with the process. My aunt has fled war, grabbed only important belongings, doesn’t speak English and desperately wants to be with family.” On Sunday, announcing that just 50 applications had been granted, the Home Office added that 11,750 people had started an application but had not yet completed it. Some applicants said it was hard to complete applications because the visa appointment website crashed midway through. Matthew Peat, a senior manager in an accountancy firm, described trying to help his sister-in-law and her nine-year-old daughter, who had travelled from Ukraine to Rome, where they were hoping to get a UK visa appointment. However, when he attempted to book a slot for them the only appointments he could access were in Poland. “It would now appear that the only way to progress this matter is to ask our exhausted and distressed family members to travel from Italy to Poland to access the system there,” he said. “They are feeling very depressed and feel that they are not welcome here.” Refugee organisations said these bureaucratic and technical issues highlighted the case for replacing a complex visa application with a simpler, visa-free humanitarian refugee scheme. Steve Valdez-Symonds, Amnesty International UK’s refugee and migrant rights director, said: “Instead of persisting with its insistence on visas or on sponsorship schemes for traumatised Ukrainians fleeing an active war zone, the UK should be putting in place fast-track refugee arrangements.” Andriy Marchenko, the deputy Ukrainian ambassador in London, urged ministers to urgently apply the proposed new scheme. He added: “Ukrainians are known to be diligent hard-working people who will be providing for themselves here. They will not overstay their welcome and at the end of their term in the UK they will return home to rebuild their country.” Lawyers working with applicants under a pro bono scheme, the Ukraine Advice Project, highlighted concerns that the family scheme was limited in its definition of immediate and extended family members, and did not include in-laws or nieces and nephews of British citizens, unless they are under 18. There was also concern that a significant number of Ukrainian nationals working or studying in the UK were excluded from the scheme, and that many people were struggling to get appointments to submit biometric data (photographs and fingerprints). A government spokesperson said details of a new humanitarian refugee route would be announced soon, adding: “This is a rapidly moving and complex picture and as the situation develops we will continue to keep our support under constant review.” News that the last UK visa centre operating in Ukraine had closed at the end of last week prompted Adil Arslan, a British citizen, to set off to drive to Ukraine on Monday to collect his stepchildren Maksym, 17 and Alina, 11, who were being cared for by grandparents. “I can’t just sit and wait in the UK while bombs are being dropped everywhere. Why on earth is Home Office not acting more swiftly?” he said. Nataliya Rumyantseva, who lives in the UK and is of Ukrainian heritage, is one of the few who has succeeded in obtaining a visa for her mother, Valentyna Klymova, 69, who fled Ukraine soon after the Russian invasion began by walking across the border into Hungary. Klymova was only granted the visa after spending three days in Paris and going between the UK embassy, consulate, visa processing centre and UK immigration officials at the train station Gare du Nord. “Not everybody can afford to spend several nights in hotels in Paris,” said Rumyantseva. “It creates a kind of existential despair in Ukrainians trying to reach the UK when they have to go through this after escaping from the war. The Home Office needs to simplify the visa process for Ukrainians.”",News/World news,Ukrainians hampered by bureaucracy from reaching safety in UK,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/ukrainians-hampered-by-bureaucracy-from-reaching-safety-in-uk
3/8/2022,"Vladimir Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine is a turning point in history. But no one knows who will emerge victorious as one era ends and another is born. Before this war, the momentum was with Mr Putin, whose military adventurism paid off in the last decade while the United States, humbled by Iraq, turned inward. However, the Russian president’s invasion of Ukraine has been a criminal mistake. Russian soldiers are killing civilians, who share a Slavic identity, and flattening cities in land that gave birth to their country’s culture. Mr Putin’s unprovoked war against a smaller, democratic neighbour has resulted in 1.7 million people fleeing their homes. This is a humanitarian crisis on the edge of Europe. If war was just a battle for public opinion, Mr Putin would have lost by now. Moscow understands this dynamic which might explain why it cynically undermined peace talks by offering humanitarian corridors for trapped populations only to shell Ukrainians who attempt to use them. This bodes ill for talks later this week between the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministries in Turkey. Moscow, perhaps for public consumption at home, is seeking to play peacemaker in a war that it started. The Kremlin’s spokesperson told Reuters that Russia was ready to halt military operations “in a moment” if Kyiv meets a list of conditions, such as recognising Crimea as Russian territory and giving two Russian-majority regions independence. It is hard to see how any government in Kyiv could survive in power if it signed such a “land-for-peace” deal. Wilful blindness lies at the heart of Russia’s problems. Mr Putin’s political blunder was to see Ukrainians as waiting to be liberated by Russian soldiers. Mr Putin’s belief that the US, the EU and the west’s Pacific allies were too divided to be capable of collective action was misguided. Not only have these nations managed to come together, but they are supplying arms to Ukraine in a manner which suggests they want Moscow defeated. Mr Putin might have wished for a quick military operation capped off by a lightning decapitation of the Ukrainian government. Instead, he faces a grinding war of occupation in the largest all-European country. Unlike in Chechnya and Syria, where Mr Putin could rely on local proxies to run a dirty war, war crimes in Ukraine will diminish Russia’s stature in the world. Moscow’s military aggression threatens its foreign policy. Mr Putin is trying to veto the Iranian nuclear deal unless he gets guarantees that Russia won’t be subject to sanctions if it convinces Tehran to sign up to the pact. Russia remains a vital player in the commodity markets. The “black earth” breadbasket of the Eurasian steppe sees Russia and Ukraine supply a quarter of the world’s wheat exports. Yet Mr Putin’s war threatens regimes – including Russia’s allies – in the Middle East who are watching wheat prices approaching levels not seen since the Arab spring. Russia’s invasion could disrupt energy markets on a scale not seen since the 1970s. Cutting off oil and gas from Russia would be a self-inflicted embargo. But it would also hit Mr Putin’s ability to pay for his war. With the spectre of runaway inflation haunting the west, Washington has begun to woo oil-rich pariahs such as Venezuela, a Russian ally. Peter Beaumont, a Guardian war reporter, wrote that where “states stand on the spectrum from fragility to resilience, an issue that takes in everything from social cohesion in conflict to the ability to sustain a protracted war effort” must be understood in conflicts in determining which side can last the course. Mr Putin is fighting the wrong war in Ukraine. Instead of finding a way of living with his neighbours, he has set himself on subduing Ukraine – and risking the ruination of Russia.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Putin’s war in Ukraine: Moscow’s on the losing side | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/07/the-guardian-view-on-putins-war-in-ukraine-moscows-on-the-losing-side
3/8/2022,"Last week’s anniversary of the murder of Sarah Everard was a reminder of everything that has gone wrong in the criminal justice system when it comes to violence against women committed by men. The way that this case and the killing of Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman were handled by the Metropolitan police was a key reason why Dame Cressida Dick was forced out of her job as its chief. Whoever replaces her in the UK’s highest-profile policing job must know that confidence in the police’s approach to female victims of sexual and violent crimes has fallen very low. A review of the way that police dealt with several earlier reports about Wayne Couzens exposing himself is ongoing. The home secretary, Priti Patel, has announced that tackling violence against women and girls (VAWG) is to become a strategic policing requirement, on an equivalent footing with terrorism, organised crime and child sexual abuse. She has also launched a campaign aimed at highlighting the scale of the problem, and encouraging men to change their behaviour. Maggie Blyth, the police’s national lead on VAWG, has admitted that one problem is the attraction policing can hold for men who seek opportunities to exert power over women. With this in mind, it is a relief that efforts are now being made to recruit more women. But the proof will be in the pudding. Cuts to budgets lie behind many of the present problems as Sarah Crew, the national police lead on rape (a separate role from Maggie Blyth’s), admitted last year. The disbanding of dedicated teams set up to investigate rapes in various forces had led, she said, to complex crimes including copious digital evidence being handled by a “very inexperienced workforce”. These damaging changes are now in the process of being reversed. Expanding the role of specialist units within the Crown Prosecution Service, and improving joint working with the police, are two strands of the CPS’s five-year plan to prosecute more rapes. More support for victims is also promised. All these initiatives will require sustained funding and training. Last year the court of appeal ruled against a group of women’s charities in a case that sought to link the declining number of prosecutions with changes to CPS guidance, which emphasised the importance of securing convictions. Low conviction rates have long been a source of concern to campaigners as well as to prosecutors. But the collapse in the number of reports leading to a trial is even more alarming, and likened by the victims’ commissioner, Dame Vera Baird, to the “decriminalisation of rape”. The number of prosecutions fell 60% in the four years to 2019/20 – a period during which the number of rapes reported almost doubled. Investigating these cases is difficult. Combing through digital evidence such as phone records is resource-intensive. But a situation in which violent men feel able to commit sexual offences with impunity, as Wayne Couzens did, is intolerable and dangerous. Women must be able to trust that their reports will be dealt with seriously and promptly, by police officers and lawyers with relevant expertise. On International Women’s Day, ministers should pledge that this will happen.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on how to convict rapists: put experts in charge | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/07/the-guardian-view-on-how-to-convict-rapists-put-experts-in-charge
3/8/2022,"The first lesson of the gas crisis is old and boring: the UK should get serious about insulating its leaky properties. If all homes that have energy performance certificate band D were upgraded to band C, the UK’s total gas demand would fall by 7%, and imports by 15%, the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit calculates. Given the UK’s wretched record in insulation versus European peers, that sounds a small but easy win. The second part – the supply side – is where the trickier stuff starts. The broad energy direction has been set towards nuclear and renewables, but there’s no getting away from the fact that gas will be in the mix for a long time yet. Virtually all transition scenarios imagine it, and you have to be an extreme optimist to believe UK consumers can quickly be converted to the joys of heat pumps. Thus, from one quarter, comes a call for a fracking revolution under Lancashire. Readers of the Mail on Sunday at the weekend were treated to a blast in the form of Nigel Farage’s refrain about how “net zero is net stupid” and that the answer to our energy woes is homegrown shale gas. Prepare to hear more in similar style. As UK wholesale gas prices reach unheard-of levels, a well-resourced fracking lobby has reassembled. It is therefore reassuring to know that the secretary of state for business and energy is having none of it. Kwasi Kwarteng wrote a sensible piece in the same paper that backed more homegrown nuclear and more renewables and pointed out the drawbacks with fracking. The gas would take a decade to arrive in volume even if the moratorium were lifted tomorrow. Local planning conditions in densely populated areas are severe; what works in Texas won’t do in Lancashire. One can add that the economics of UK shale are currently guesswork: having 50 years of theoretical reserves doesn’t mean it can all be recovered at commercially viable prices. But here’s the rub. “We also need to back North Sea oil and gas while we transition to cheap, clean power,” said Kwarteng. On that score he is surely also correct. There is “a certain hypocrisy”, as the independent energy analyst Peter Atherton puts it, on the part of the opponents of North Sea development “in being anti-UK production when they know that all their own scenarios see the need for substantial amounts of gas into the 2030s.” Quite: if the gas is going to arrive anyway, best to get it close to home where environmental standards can be controlled. It’s not a universally popular view, but it would be legitimate for Kwarteng to ask North Sea firms for projections of how much they could increase gas output over the next one, five and 10 years while we wait for extra renewables and nuclear capacity to arrive. Then it would be a matter of incentivising production (whether by contracts-for-difference or whatever) from a source that, unlike shale, offers certainty. Since gas projects work on long payback horizons, we might find ourselves paying extra to turn off supplies in the mid-2030s to hit carbon-reduction targets, but that, unfortunately is the current unattractive position. Simple solutions do not exist, but the need to retain secure supplies plus broad consumer support for net zero targets persists. Investing in North Sea gas, as a backup to the drive towards low-carbon tech, looks only pragmatic. The Conservative peer Greg Barker was adamant last week. “Whatever the optics,” he would not “shirk responsibility” by resigning as executive chairman of EN+, the aluminium giant founded by the sanctioned Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. He was thinking only about the company’s employees. A few days’ reflection – or perhaps the sight of senior Conservative voices calling for his removal from the House of Lords – have prompted a rethink. Barker has tendered his resignation. One cannot yet call it a clean departure, though, because in the next breath, EN+ confirmed reports that it was considering spinning off a chunk of its business, including the non-Russian operations of the core Rusal subsidiary. Barker, it seems, could re-emerge as head of the carved-out operation. His high-profile resignation, in other words, could end up being more of a soft-shoe shuffle into a new role within a restructured entity. Maybe he wouldn’t be paid a salary of $4m a year in the new gig, as he was at EN+ in 2020, but we’re at the point in this saga where personal credibility demands a full exit. He should not have taken a job at a Deripaska-backed firm in the first place. Just get out altogether now.",News/Business,Looking at new North Sea gas supplies may not be palatable but is pragmatic | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/mar/07/looking-at-new-north-sea-gas-supplies-may-not-be-palatable-but-is-pragmatic

3/8/2022,"My wife, Milica “Misha” Brozović, who has died aged 84, was a leading figure in the medical field of haematology. She was deeply committed to caring for patients and their families dealing with inherited blood diseases such as sickle cell disease. Her work resulted in better treatment, information and screening services nationally for these patients. Born in Belgrade, Serbia, Misha was the daughter of Jelisaveta (nee Vuković) and Filip Vasić, chief scientist at the city’s Institute for the Economics of Investments. While at grammar school she decided to become a physician. After graduating in medicine from the University of Belgrade in 1962 and completing her internship, she went to London in 1964 as a research assistant in the department of haematology at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School. After appointments at Hammersmith hospital, St Bartholomew’s, the National Institute for Medical Research and Northwick Park hospital, she was invited to become the first consultant haematologist in the Central Middlesex hospital in London in 1975. There she encountered patients, and their families, who were severely affected by sickle cell disease and for whom appropriate medical and social services did not exist. With the help of her colleagues, medical and social workers, in 1979 Misha established the Brent Sickle Cell Centre, providing treatment, information and advice. The group also established services for neonatal screening for haemoglobin S for families, and later a regional referral centre for neonatal screening of other abnormalities of haemoglobin synthesis. The department became a model whose influence spread nationwide and provided an impetus for the creation of the Sickle Cell Society, a registered charity established in 1979. Misha was a leader as well as a physician, teacher, researcher and administrator. As a physician she was loved by her patients. As a teacher at Central Middlesex and at St Mary’s Hospital Medical School she influenced several young doctors to become professors in haematology. As a researcher she published more than 100 papers. For a while she was also head of the pathology department at Central Middlesex. After retirement in 1993, Misha continued working as a visiting consultant haematologist in the university hospitals of the Medical School of Abu Dhabi, the Medical School of Cape Town, and the Medical School of Otago at the University in Christchurch. In the 2010s, and back in the UK, Misha studied astronomy, obtaining a diploma in the subject from University College London. Misha enjoyed life, always with a smile on her face: with friends, visiting museums, going to concerts and theatres, and walking and climbing. She was an avid explorer, loved hiking on her local Ridgeway trail, in the Lake District or in Zanskar, northern India, diving in the Maldives, and exploring the Arabian desert. Above all, though, she cherished the time she spent with her grandchildren, Daniel, Helen and Nina. We met in the Julian Alps in Slovenia during a snowstorm in 1955, and married three years later.

3/8/2022,"In the southern port city of Mariupol, police were going from basement shelter to basement shelter. The message to those who have been trapped by days of brutal Russian shelling in the besieged city of 430,000 on the Sea of Azov was simple. Do not come out, terrified residents were warned, until you hear a message on the loud speakers. Do not try to evacuate, despite the promises by Russian forces of safe passage. The warning was well founded. On the main road out – eyed as a key escape route – heavy Russian shelling continued on Monday, Ukrainian forces said. The previous day officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross had identified it as having been mined. “The route is not safe,” said Sergei Orlov, the deputy mayor. “We do not have confirmation at the moment that a ceasefire started.” The day after eight civilians including a family of three were killed by Russian mortar fire while trying to evacuate from Irpin on the outskirts of Kyiv, analysts and political leaders were experiencing a sense of deja vu, pointing to the cynical Russian use of humanitarian corridors in Chechnya and more recently in Syria, where Russian – or Russian-brokered – promises of safe passage were either worthless, or used as a ploy to allow the repositioning of forces. In 2018, in the eastern Damascus suburb of Ghouta, under siege from the Kremlin-backed Syrian government, the Russians, acting as mediators, brokered a ceasefire with the UN to allow civilians to escape. Instead civilians were shelled as they attempted to escape, prompting a US State Department spokesman to condemn the ceasefire as “a joke”. Analyst Anna Borshchevskaya, writing a paper for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a conservative thinktank, drew a line between Russian manipulation of ceasefires in Syria and what has been happening in Ukraine, describing “a string of broken ceasefires”. The Russian offer of six humanitarian corridors out of Ukrainian cities, of which four led to Russia or pro-Russia Belarus, was being described in similar terms to the grim “joke” in Ghouta – as a “cynical” stunt, “immoral” and “hypocritical”. In reality, as Ukrainian officials pointed out, despite the promise of a ceasefire, it was Russian shelling that was preventing the evacuation of civilians from Kyiv, Mariupol, Sumy, Kharkiv, Volnovakha and Mykolaiv. “This prevents the safe passage of humanitarian columns with Ukrainian and foreign citizens, as well as the delivery of medicines and food,” Ukraine’s foreign ministry said in a statement. “All this is not serious, it is moral and political cynicism, which I find intolerable,” the French president Emmanuel Macron said. “I don’t know many Ukrainians who want to take refuge in Russia,” he told LCI television. Ukrainian officials described the humanitarian corridor offer as “completely immoral” and called for genuine safe routes for civilians. The Russian defence ministry later announced a new push, saying civilians would be allowed to leave Kyiv, Mariupol, Kharkiv and Sumy, but it came as Russian forces continued to pound other locations across the country. And as the hours passed on Monday with little sign of a ceasefire, it appeared there had been little meaningful evacuation. The conflict has driven over 1.7 million to flee the country and millions more are trapped under brutal Russian bombardment of civilian areas and are seeking to escape. The mayor of Irpin, where eight people were killed by Russian mortar fire during an evacuation attempt on Sunday, accused Russian forces of deliberately targeting those fleeing. “Everyone knows where we are taking civilians out by car, along the evacuation routes. And they are targeting the routes,” said Oleksandr Markushin, echoing accusations that Russia had also shelled an evacuation route from Mariupol. The handful of residents of the port city of 430,000 who managed to flee said it had been devastated. “We saw everything: houses burning, all the people sitting in basements,” said Yelena Zamay, who fled to one of the self-proclaimed republics in eastern Ukraine held by pro-Russian separatists. “No communication, no water, no gas, no light, no water. There was nothing.” The description was echoed by Dmytro Gurin, a Ukrainian MP whose parents were still in the city. “My mom is 67; my dad 69,” he said in a Twitter thread. “The last time I heard from them was day before yesterday at 9am. The conversation lasted 30 seconds. Their phones are dead. Their neighbour had 20% charge left. Yesterday he said they are alive. There is no mobile network anymore.” Russian forces continued their offensive in Mykolaiv, opening fire on the city some 300 miles south of Kyiv, according to Ukraine’s general staff, while emergency officials in the Kharkiv region said overnight shelling killed at least eight people and wrecked residential buildings, medical, educational and adminstrative facilities. “Russia continues to carry out rocket, bomb and artillery strikes on the cities and settlements of Ukraine,” the general staff said, and repeated earlier Ukrainian accusations that Russia has targeted humanitarian corridors. The statement also accused Russian forces of taking women and children hostage and placing weapons in residential areas of cities – though it did not elaborate or provide evidence. The accusation came as the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed seven attacks on healthcare infrastructure in Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion, up from four the previous day. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Twitter on Sunday that “several” attacks had occurred, without giving details, adding they were a violation of international humanitarian law.

3/8/2022,"Statistics can tell the tale of Liverpool’s recovery over the past 12 months – Jürgen Klopp’s team suffered a sixth successive home league defeat one year ago on Monday and host Internazionale on Tuesday aiming for a 13th straight win in all competitions – but Fabinho’s Panenka in the Carabao Cup final paints it better. There is no clearer expression of the confidence flowing through Liverpool than the high-risk plan the Brazilian hatched 24 hours before going eye-to-eye with Kepa Arrizabalaga at Wembley. “The day before I tried to do a Panenka,” the midfielder recalls of his impudent penalty in Liverpool’s shootout success against Chelsea. “It was just me and Luis Díaz, with no goalkeeper in the goal. I told him: ‘Tomorrow if it goes to pens, I will shoot it like this.’ He didn’t believe me. But when I was walking to the box to take the penalty, it was in my mind to shoot a Panenka. When you shoot a penalty like this you know that, if you miss, when you come back to the dressing room everyone will kill you. But it was in my mind that I would take it like this and that I could do it.” Fabinho’s self-belief stands in stark contrast to Liverpool’s confidence level of 12 months ago. Fulham left Anfield with what appeared a precious win in their attempt to avoid relegation, condemning Klopp’s side to the worst home run in Liverpool’s history in the process. It was Fulham’s last Premier League victory of a doomed campaign. It was also the last time Liverpool lost at Anfield. “I remember this game,” Fabinho says. “The confidence of the team was really low, it wasn’t the only game we lost at home. The moment wasn’t good but we won the next game against Leipzig and we started to change it around. Since the start of this season some of the players came back from injury and other things changed as well – I didn’t play centre-back any more! We’ve not had many injuries this season and we’ve won almost every home game, which is important. If you want to fight for the league you have to perform, not just at home, but at home is really important.” The 2-0 win at San Siro three weeks ago flattered the visitors but Liverpool are not complaining. They have never lost a European tie after winning the first leg away from Anfield and have been knocked out of Europe only once when holding a two-goal first-leg advantage. That was against Inter in the 1965 European Cup semi-finals, when Bill Shankly’s team were controversially beaten 3-0 at San Siro having won the first leg 3-1 at home. Klopp, who has Roberto Firmino, Thiago Alcântara and Joël Matip available after recent injuries and illness, said: “It’s a much better result than I would have expected before we played there. The game didn’t look like we’d win 2-0 for most of the time, it was a really tough tie and really difficult game to play. “We knew before they have quality and after that we knew they have real quality. They come here having won 5-0 [against Salernitana on Friday]. It was against the bottom team but it was still really impressive. [Lautaro] Martínez scored, [Edin] Dzeko scored and when I saw the game I’m really happy that [the suspended Nicolò] Barella isn’t playing as he set up three or four goals. That’s a really experienced team and they don’t come here as tourists. They want to chase the game and that’s what we want to do. We aren’t a team that defends results – we want to attack the game again.”",Sport/Football,Fabinho claims high-risk Panenka plan shows Liverpool’s renewed self-belief,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/07/fabinho-says-high-risk-panenka-plan-shows-liverpools-renewed-self-belief
3/8/2022,"A disused Manchester viaduct will transform into an urban “sky park” this summer, providing much needed green space to one of Britain’s least verdant city centres. The National Trust has begun transforming half of the 330-metre long, 56-arch Castlefield Viaduct into a temporary park that is due to open in July and has been compared to New York’s High Line. The park will be planted with trees and shrubs, including Manchester poplars, one of the few species hardy enough to survive the pollution of the Industrial Revolution. The herb comfrey will also be cultivated, once used by mill workers to soothe feet sore from hard days in clogs, as well as the cotton flower, Manchester’s county bloom. There will be raised beds and places to sit, as well as a covered pavilion to provide shelter for those Manchester rainy days, where visitors will be invited to meditate. Though access will initially be limited to 100 free tickets a day, the National Trust hopes the yearlong project will lead to a permanent public space that will eventually expand and be open to all. Duncan Laird, head of urban places at the trust, said the scheme could eventually incorporate a traffic-free walking and cycling route between Deansgate and Cornbrook over a mile away – currently a hairy journey by bike or on foot. For 53 years, Castlefield Viaduct has stood dormant and overgrown, tantalisingly visible to passengers on passing trams and trains but infuriatingly out of bounds to everyone other than the most intrepid graffiti artists. The Grade II-listed structure was built in 1892 after a period of “railway mania”, in which commercial speculation and competition for routes led to the rapid construction of lines and expansion of the railway network. By 1939, the bridge carried 11 million passengers and 85 million tonnes of goods a year from Chester and Liverpool to Manchester. The line shut in 1969 with the closure of Manchester Central station, now home to party political conferences, with trains diverted instead to Piccadilly and Oxford Road stations. Hilary McGrady, director-general of the National Trust, said Covid had highlighted the importance of urban green space. “The pandemic showed us the importance of our local parks and gardens, but it also highlighted significant inequalities in access to green space in urban areas like Manchester,” she said. “By working with others, we aim to increase access to parks and green spaces in, around and near urban areas, so eventually everyone is in easy reach of quiet places for reflection with wide open skies.” The trust has raised two-thirds of the £1.8m project cost via public donations and the People’s Postcode Lottery, and will be fundraising for the rest. The Castlefield Sky Park is part of a renaissance of Manchester’s old railway lines. Several nearby railway arches will soon be turned into Embassy Village, a purpose-built facility for homeless people, while others have become home to breweries and other small businesses. The rapidly expanding city is notably short of green space, although another urban park, Mayfield, which includes a giant slide, is due to open next year next to Piccadilly. New York’s 2.3km High Line, completed in 2014, kickstarted a global trend for turning disused railway lines into parks. But while “doing a High Line” has become lazy shorthand for fashioning anything vaguely parklike out of an urban space, the Castlefield Sky Park does follow a similar blueprint, being both high up and on a railway line. A similar project is in the planning stages in Camden, north London. The Camden High Line will be 1.2km long, about 8 metres above ground, and connect Camden Gardens in the west to York Way in the east.",News/UK news,Manchester viaduct to become an urban ‘sky park’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/07/manchester-viaduct-to-become-an-urban-sky-park
3/8/2022,"A western embargo on Russian oil and gas is no longer unthinkable after the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, revealed that the idea was gaining traction in the White House and had been the subject of “very active discussion” with allies. The reaction was dramatic, with Brent crude oil hitting levels not seen since 2008, while gas soared to all-time highs as traders considered whether it could be thrown into the mix too. Pushback from Germany’s new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, came as no surprise given his country’s heavy reliance on Russian oil and gas. “Supplying Europe with energy for heat generation, mobility, electricity supply and industry cannot be secured in any other way at the moment,” he said. Meanwhile, consumers’ money is funding the war in Ukraine. EU oil purchases alone are putting $285m a day into Russian pockets, according to the Brussels-based NGO Transport Environment. So how realistic is a ban and how high could prices go? Up to 40% of Europe’s gas comes from Russia, a reliance that has already been in sharp focus during the colder winter months. As warmer days arrive and the immediate need for gas diminishes, it should be remembered that the picture isn’t all that different for crude oil and other petroleum products. About 5m barrels per day (bpd) flow out of Russia, the world’s second largest exporter after Saudi Arabia. About half goes to the EU, which relies on Russia for 27% of its imports and about 15% of its total consumption. The UK is less dependent, importing 4.7m tonnes of Russian oil in 2021, just under 100,000 bpd, which was less than 10% of consumption. But, as with gas, the UK cannot escape the impact of global market prices for commodities, which would filter through into much higher costs for ordinary people. Solving the gas conundrum is tough enough, involving a combination of increased production from elsewhere, reducing demand, buying more liquefied natural gas (LNG) and pushing harder on renewables and nuclear. Throwing oil into the bargain only adds to the headache. “A disruption on such a massive scale cannot be met by other producers, at least not for the foreseeable future,” said Ole Hansen, of Saxo Bank. One option under discussion is for the US to lift sanctions on Iran and Venezuela. “Iran could add about 1.3m bpd of additional oil into the market,” said Sophie Udubasceanu, a global crude oil expert at ICIS. But she warned that contribution from Venezuela relied on the country solving persistent output problems. America’s own reserves offer some hope. The US exported 3.45m bpd in December last year and could increase that. None of this could happen quickly. “Raising production from these producers would take months for Iran, quarters for the US and years for Venezuela,” said Hansen. Another route is to convince Opec, the cartel of oil-producing nations such as Saudi Arabia, to loosen the taps. Only last week though, with the Ukraine invasion in full swing, Opec stuck to a meagre 400,000 bpd increase. It depends on the geopolitical reality. The all-time high is $147.50, set in July 2008, and some analysts think it could go higher. The UBS commodity analyst Giovanni Staunovo said a prolonged war could take the price above that record, to $150 or more. Analysts at Bank of America said that if most of Russia’s oil exports were cut off, the resulting 5m bpd shortfall could push prices as high as $200. A huge increase in the cost of everything from petrol at the pumps to any goods transported by road, adding to sky-high inflation and the cost-of-living crisis. There is a saying that the best cure for a high price is a high price, a reference to the concept of demand destruction. If oil gets so expensive that people cannot afford it, they stop buying and the price comes down again. However, that most likely means measures such as industrial shutdowns, causing a significant downturn in economic activity and, very probably, recession. The Ukraine crisis has highlighted the importance of switching to sustainable energy sources, not just to address the climate crisis. Jim Watson, a professor of energy policy and the director of the UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources, said: “We urgently need to a new programme to upgrade and insulate our homes after a decade of inaction and poorly designed policies. The [UK] government should also keep its foot on the renewables accelerator – and continue to expand investment in low-cost sources of electricity such as solar and wind.” While this approach would reduce reliance on Russia, it would take some years to come to fruition – potentially even longer than finding new supplies of gas and oil.
