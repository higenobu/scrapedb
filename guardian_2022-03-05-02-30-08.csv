3/5/2022,"Climate activists have deflated the tyres of SUVs in some of London’s wealthiest postcodes to protest against the emissions from such vehicles. About 40 SUV-owning residents of Kensington and Chelsea, Dulwich, Primrose Hill and Marylebone woke to find their tyres flat, with fake “parking fines” on their windscreens informing them that “if SUV drivers were a nation, in 2018 they would have been ranked as the seventh biggest emitter of CO2”. The cars are often nicknamed “Chelsea tractors”, since although the vehicles were originally intended to be used on difficult terrain, they have become ubiquitous in well-off urban areas. A recent study found that three-quarters of the 360,000 SUVs sold in 2019 in the UK were bought by people living in towns and cities, and the royal borough of Kensington and Chelsea is in the top three districts for the sale of large SUVs. More Range Rovers were sold in Kensington and Chelsea than anywhere else; with one in 10 new cars registered in the borough belonging to the Land Rover brand of SUV. The Dulwich Society, a community representing the interests of local people in the leafy suburb of Dulwich, condemned the action. A spokesperson said: “Several cars were vandalised in Dulwich last night with tyres deflated and this poster left on windscreens. We are environmentally friendly but this is not who we are as a community.” However, the activists said the tyres were let down without damage, and that the action was necessary to educate the vehicle owners about the fossil fuels emitted by the large cars. They pointed out that petrol and diesel SUVs produce 25% more CO2 on average than a medium-sized car and are far more deadly. SUVs are significantly more likely to kill pedestrians in crashes and those driving them are 11% more likely to die in a crash than people in normal cars. A spokesperson for Last Gasp said: “We disarmed these SUVs because they are a growing and needless part of the system that is killing us. Nobody needs a planet-wrecking SUV. To drive an SUV in an urban area with good public transport is a luxury – and it’s a luxury that has terrifying consequences for our planet. SUVs poison our children’s lungs, cause so many deaths on the road, and spew out carbon dioxide into a climate on the brink of collapse. If you are worried about getting your tyres deflated, our advice is: don’t own an SUV. We do not intend to stop, and many more will follow us. “We wish we had other effective means to defend ourselves, but luxury emissions must stop now. Spend one afternoon reading the science and it is clear – people must take action now to defend life itself.”",News/Environment,Climate activists deflate SUV tyres in wealthy London neighbourhoods,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/04/climate-activists-deflate-suv-tyres-in-wealthy-london-neighbourhoods
3/5/2022,"Lindsey Graham attracted widespread condemnationafter the South Carolina senator suggested Vladimir Putin should be assassinated in order to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Graham first made the suggestion in an appearance on Fox News host Sean Hannity’s show on Thursday evening, and he then repeated the idea in a tweet that quickly went viral. “Is there a Brutus in Russia? Is there a more successful Colonel Stauffenberg in the Russian military? The only way this ends is for somebody in Russia to take this guy out,” Graham said on Twitter. “You would be doing your country - and the world - a great service.” Brutus refers to one of the assassins of Roman emperor Julius Caesar, and Stauffenberg was a German army officer who was executed for attempting to kill Adolf Hitler in 1944. Graham added in a separate tweet: “The only people who can fix this are the Russian people. Easy to say, hard to do. Unless you want to live in darkness for the rest of your life, be isolated from the rest of the world in abject poverty, and live in darkness you need to step up to the plate.” Despite immediate criticism of Graham’s comments from both left and right in the US, he doubled down on the idea in a Friday morning interview with “Fox and Friends”. “I’m hoping somebody in Russia will understand that he is destroying Russia, and you need to take this guy out by any means possible,” Graham said. Is there a Brutus in Russia? Is there a more successful Colonel Stauffenberg in the Russian military?The only way this ends is for somebody in Russia to take this guy out.You would be doing your country - and the world - a great service. Russian officials also attacked Graham’s comments as “criminal” and demanded that the US government provide an explanation for his rhetoric. “The degree of Russophobia and hatred in the United States towards Russia is off the scale,” the Russian ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, said in a Facebook post. “It is impossible to believe that a senator of a country that promotes its moral values as a ‘guiding star’ for all mankind could afford to call for terrorism as a way to achieve Washington’s goals in the international arena.” American lawmakers of both parties responded to Graham’s comments with shock, dismay and outrage, pointing out the danger in demanding the assassination of a leader whose troops are currently engaged in shelling nuclear plants. “I really wish our members of Congress would cool it and regulate their remarks as the administration works to avoid [World War III],” progressive congresswoman Ilhan Omar said in a tweet. “As the world pays attention to how the US and [its] leaders are responding, Lindsey’s remarks and remarks made by some House members aren’t helpful.” Democratic Senator Brian Schatz added, “I have seen at least a half a dozen insane tweets tonight. Please everyone keep your wits about you.” I really wish our members of Congress would cool it and regulate their remarks as the administration works to avoid WWlll. As the world pays attention to how the US and it’s leaders are responding, Lindsey’s remarks and remarks made by some House members aren’t helpful. Republican members of Congress were no less critical, as Senator Ted Cruz derided Graham’s suggestion as “an exceptionally bad idea”. “Use massive economic sanctions; BOYCOTT Russian oil [and] gas; and provide military aid so the Ukrainians can defend themselves,” Cruz said. “But we should not be calling for the assassination of heads of state.” Even Marjorie Taylor Greene – the extremist congresswoman who has sparked outrage for, among other things, comparing coronavirus-related restrictions to the treatment of Jewish people during the Holocaust – chimed in from the right with criticism of Graham. “While we are all praying for peace [and] for the people of Ukraine, this is irresponsible, dangerous [and] unhinged. We need leaders with calm minds [and] steady wisdom,” Green said on Twitter. “Not blood thirsty warmongering politicians trying to tweet tough by demanding assassinations. Americans don’t want war.” Experts in Russian politics argued that Graham’s suggestion was not only irresponsible but also unrealistic. Bill Browder, the financier whose work against Russian corruption led to the Magnitsky Act of 2012, described Putin as “probably the most paranoid man in the world”. “He’s a very little man. He’s very scared of everybody, and he’s very vindictive. And so he’s constantly looking around for betrayal,” Browder told CNN on Friday. “I don’t think that there’s going to be a palace coup because he’s looking to try to stop it.”",News/US news,Outcry after US senator Lindsey Graham suggests Putin’s assassination,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/04/lindsey-graham-suggests-putin-assassination-russia-ukraine
3/5/2022,"When the Queen tested positive for Covid at the age of 95, it made headlines around the world. Buckingham Palace initially said she would carry on working but was soon forced to concede she needed rest and cancelled a series of virtual engagements. Now, royal observers are speculating whether the monarch will ever return to full duties. While they dismissed the idea of her voluntarily relinquishing her core duties, respected authors and academics said the days of walkabouts and meet-and-greets could well be over for the Queen. The royal author Penny Junor said: “I think she still feels there’s life in her yet. I think she enjoys what she does and, so long as she is fit enough, she will carry on doing light duties. But I don’t think we will see her going back to travelling the country on a weekly basis and doing quite so many receptions and live engagements. “She is about to be 96. That is a very, very good age. And she’s remarkable for that age, physically. But I think she is getting frailer, inevitably, and the fact she stepped back from one or two duties before she got Covid – before the Cop26 conference – I think that was really her acknowledging that to be running around like a 65-year-old when you’re 95 catches up with you.” Instead, Junor suggested the monarch might continue to hold many engagements via video link in future to lighten the burden. “There would be huge disappointment if she disappeared from view. People want to see a familiar face, a comforting face, a reassuring face. And if that’s on the end of a video call, then so be it. She’s put out some very powerful messages via video link,” Junor said. The Queen appeared to have recovered well from Covid when she appeared in two virtual audiences with foreign ambassadors on Tuesday, nine days after catching the virus that affects older people more seriously than the young. She spoke to three foreign diplomats from her home at Windsor Castle. She has also been facing personal trauma after the loss of her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, last year and the stress of her son Prince Andrew facing, then settling, a sexual assault case filed against him in the US. Andrew has denied any wrongdoing. The settlement spared him the potential humiliation of giving evidence in a trial and protected the royal family from further reputational damage. The campaign group Republic said that, should the Queen find herself unable to carry on, she should step down – like anyone else no longer able to do their job – and be replaced by an elected head of state. However, Junor was joined by Prof Vernon Bogdanor, an author, political scientist and expert on the British constitution, and Joe Little, the managing editor of Majesty magazine, in her belief that there would be no circumstances short of death or loss of mental capacity under which they could see the Queen relinquishing her duties – though all three said it was quite possible those duties would no longer be carried out face to face. Little said he believed she would continue with public engagements, but said that how she approaches those planned for coming weeks would indicate how she was likely to see out her reign. “The way Buckingham Palace have phrased it when announcing the programme for March is these are engagements that the Queen hopes to attend. So there’s no commitment, there’s an element of flexibility there that she will if she can. “I would guess this is how it’s going to be for the remainder of her reign; it will depend on the Queen’s health as to how much is arranged for her publicly.” He added: “Of course, she has not really be seen in public for two years [amid the Covid pandemic]. There have been occasional outings. But, on a grand scale and the way that she would normally have been seen, we’ve had to rely on TV messages. So she is very keen to be seen again. Whether that is possible remains to be seen.”",News/UK news,Royal observers wonder if the Queen will ever return to full duties,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/04/royal-observers-wonder-if-the-queen-will-ever-return-to-full-duties
3/5/2022,"British and European gas prices both hit record highs on Friday as the war in Ukraine continued to wreak havoc on energy markets, threatening to exacerbate the cost of living crisis. The UK National Balancing Point (NBP) benchmark soared above 500p a therm at one point, smashing through the previous all-time high set in December amid a prolonged surge that caused the collapse of a series of household gas suppliers. The Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) for delivery in April, a common benchmark for European gas, hit €200 for the first time, before settling back later in the day. Analysts warned that fresh rises could follow as energy traders digest the risks of disruption to pipelines in Ukraine, sanctions and cold weather expected later this month. Sky-high gas prices have already forced Ofgem to increase the price cap on what household suppliers can charge, with the new maximum of £1,971 for a default dual-fuel tariff set to take effect in April. The increase reflected a four-fold rise in energy market prices before Russia, the world’s second-largest gas supplier, invaded Ukraine, the country through which many of its gas pipelines to Europe run. Prices have surged again since the outbreak of war, prompting warnings that the cap on bills could rise to as much as £3,000 when Ofgem next sets the price cap, in October. Russia supplies up to 40% of Europe’s gas, although the figure is below 4% for the UK. “The market is trying to price both the likelihood and impact of a Russian flow cut, be it due to the conflict in Ukraine causing physical disruption to gas transit or due to a ramp-up in sanctions cutting flows all together,” said Tom Rodgers, European gas analyst at ICIS. “The former could be compensated somewhat by Yamal [pipeline] flows, unless you lose all Ukrainian transit. While the latter remains a low likelihood event, that would be probably the largest ever change in European gas supply. “This is on top on what was an already tight market.” He warned that expected cold weather in north-western Europe could drive prices higher.",News/Business,Gas prices hit record high again as Ukraine invasion disrupts markets,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/04/gas-prices-hit-record-high-again-as-ukraine-invasion-disrupts-markets
3/5/2022,"The government has called for teachers’ starting salaries in England to rise by more than 16% over the next two years but wants below-inflation increases for more experienced teachers. In its submission to the school teacher review body (STRB), the independent panel that makes recommendations on pay, the Department for Education (DfE) said it wants the statutory minimum for new teachers to rise by 8.9% in September and by a further 7.1% the following year. The increases would take the starting salary for qualified teachers from £25,714 to £30,000 in September 2023 – fulfilling a promise made in the 2019 Conservative election manifesto although a year later than promised. The boost for new teachers would be followed by tapering rises for those with more experience, with the upper end of the early career pay scale increasing by just 2% in 2023-24. More senior teachers and school leaders would see pay increases of just 3% in 2022-23, and 2% in 2023-24. Last month the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee forecast inflation to hit about 6% later this year and remain above 5% until well into 2023. The DfE said the pay rises would come from existing school budgets. Although schools have wide discretion over pay, in practice most state schools in England follow the guidance issued by the STRB and government. The DfE’s submission said it wanted the STRB to back “substantially higher” increases to help recruit and retain young teachers. But it argued that increased pay across the board would eat into school funding, calculating that a 1% pay rise for all teachers translated into £250m less in spending available to schools. “Investment in teacher pay beyond that which is proposed will therefore limit headteachers’ ability to strike the right balance of investment for their schools, resulting in reduced investment in other priority areas that are also vital in driving the best outcomes for pupils and staff,” the DfE told the STRB. However, the DfE forecast that the pay rises would only improve retention rates by 0.25%, with just 1,000 more teachers staying in the profession. The four main teaching unions submitted a joint appeal to the STRB, stating: “Increases to starting pay must be accompanied by equivalent increases for all teachers and school leaders. The increases must be enough to start to restore the pay losses against inflation since 2010.” The NASUWT said it wanted a 12% pay increase across the board. Patrick Roach, its general secretary, said some teachers were having to use food banks or other forms of charitable assistance, cutting back on essential household items or taking a second job. “We believe that the current challenges facing the profession are so significant that the government must look more broadly at remuneration, and implement structural reform of the teachers pay framework in order to ensure it is fit for purpose,” Roach said. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “We will call on the STRB to recommend that all teachers and school leaders get the same increases proposed for new teachers, and that the government should fully fund it.” Meanwhile university staff are to continue their industrial action over pay, pensions and working conditions, after the University and College Union announced five more days of strikes later this month. Staff at 68 universities have just finished 10 days of strikes but employers have failed to make concessions, especially on changes to pensions that the union says will cause cuts of 35% in retirement income for typical members. The latest round will see 38 universities strike for five days from 21 March to 25 March, and another 30 universities striking from 28 March to 1 April, affecting more than 1 million students.",News/Education,DfE calls for boost to starting teachers’ salaries in England,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/04/dfe-calls-for-boost-to-starting-teachers-salaries-in-england
3/5/2022,"There’s been some dark news lately, but “every once in awhile, there’s a little gleam of sunshine in the world: a child’s smile, the first flower of spring, the January 6 committee laying out potential criminal charges against the former president,” said Stephen Colbert to audience applause on Thursday night. “Turns out there is a chance that trying to violently overthrow our democracy might be illegal.” The House select committee investigating the 6 January attack said in a major filing on Wednesday that it believed Donald Trump violated multiple federal laws to overturn the 2020 election. “To paraphrase an idiot and his bloodthirsty mob: lock him up,” said Colbert. The filing said that Jason Miller, Trump’s senior campaign adviser, told the committee in a deposition that Trump was well aware that his claims of a stolen election were false, because he had been told shortly after election day by a campaign data expert “in pretty blunt terms” that he was going to lose. “How blunt?” Colbert wondered. “Because if the message was delivered via anything more complicated than scratch and sniff, I don’t think it’s going to get through.” Jimmy Kimmel also celebrated potential criminal charges against Trump on Thursday evening, and mocked the former president’s limp denial released in a statement. “He released that statement through a spokesperson, because his new billion-dollar social media platform that launched nine days ago still isn’t going,” Kimmel explained of Trump’s beleaguered social media startup, Truth Social. “He posted there once, one day, and that’s it. This is the one that’s supposed to replace Twitter – even he’s not using it. “In other waste of money news, you know that big, beautiful wall he almost partially built?” Kimmel said, noting it had been breached by smugglers over 3,000 times in the past three years because of a design flaw. “Basically Trump just installed a $15bn doggie door along the southern border.” Kimmel also discussed reports that China requested Vladimir Putin delay his planned invasion of Ukraine until after the Winter Olympics in Beijing. “How does that conversation even go?” he wondered. “Hey Vlad, I know you had your heart set on killing everyone around Valentine’s Day. Could you maybe hold off for a beat so we could bobsled?” China has disputed the story as fake, “which is rich coming from a country with an official department of propaganda. China claiming fake news is like Beyond Beef claiming fake meat.” It's great to see Ukraine's neighbors welcoming refugees with open arms. But it's worth taking a look at why refugees from Africa and the Middle East haven't received the same treatment. pic.twitter.com/1ebe5zqeqq On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah praised eastern European countries’ warm and welcome approach to over a million refugees from Ukraine but contrasted their compassionate treatment with the handling of migrants from Syria and North Africa, who were generally treated with scorn and distrust. In 2015, for example, Hungary put up a 13ft fence topped with barbed wire running 115 miles along its border with Serbia, and its prime minister, Viktor Orbán, said: “Please don’t come.” “When it’s Syrians who are fleeing a war, it’s all ‘we do not have space, do not come,’” Noah said. “But now there’s space and people must come? What changed? I mean, when the Syrians needed refuge, even the camera crew was drop-kicking families. But now the Ukrainians are getting accommodations, they’re getting visas, they’re getting work benefits – which, by the way, is good! “We don’t even have to speculate” about the difference in treatment, he continued. The prime minister of Bulgaria said it last week about the Ukrainian refugees: “These are not the refugees we are used to … these people are Europeans. These people are intelligent, they are educated people …” “I’m impressed that the prime minister of Bulgaria has found the time to get to know all 1 million refugees who have fled Ukraine in the past week,” Noah deadpanned. “He must be very efficient at making small talk.” More seriously, Noah said he understood that European countries “have to think about how easy it is for refugees to integrate into their culture and society. I get that, I truly get that. It’s just like how it’s easier for you to take in a family member who’s in trouble than a random person who needs help. “But it doesn’t mean it’s impossible. And the problem I have is that when it’s Syrians, or Africans on a boat, these countries didn’t even try to integrate them,” he continued. “They reject even the chance that anyone brown could assimilate.” And on Late Night, Seth Meyers mocked the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, for scolding a group of high schoolers about wearing masks during a press conference. “Let’s just establish the facts here: DeSantis is obviously wrong and masks absolutely help control the spread of Covid,” Meyers said. “Studies have repeatedly proven that over and over again. And the better the mask, the better the protection. “It won’t surprise you to learn that he was celebrated later that night by a host on Fox News, who thought that it was hilarious that he yelled at a bunch of teenagers who were trying to stay safe and do the right thing,” he added. The Fox News host Laura Ingraham praised DeSantis, saying “someone has to tell these kids to push away all of the brainwashing that they’ve been subject to”. “What kind of adult laughs at another adult yelling at a bunch of kids?” Meyers said. “If you’ve ever seen an 80s comedy, you know it’s the opposite. It’s funny when teens gets the best of adults.”",Arts/Culture,Stephen Colbert on Trump’s possible criminal charges: ‘Lock him up’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/04/stephen-colbert-trump-criminal-charges-late-show-recap
3/5/2022,"What with their country being reduced to smouldering piles of rubble by a paranoid maniac, the chances of their national football team participating at the Human Rights World Cup are probably not weighing heavily in the minds of too many Ukrainians right now. But as the great Arrigo Sacchi once said, football is the most important of the least important things, and Ukraine are scheduled to play Scotland later this month at Hampden, with the winners going on to play Wales or Austria for a place at this year’s ill-advised winter jamboree. As inconsequential as it might seem in the cosmic scheme of things, a decision needs to be made over whether or not the match can or will go ahead. The Ukrainian FA has officially asked Fifa and Uefa for a postponement, casting massive doubt on the likelihood of it being played in three weeks’ time. As Russian missiles continued to rain down on cities the length and breadth of Ukraine, Fifa reacted with its usual efficiency and decisiveness, issuing a 62-word statement that, like many of its public pronouncements, didn’t say much. What’s more, in keeping with their president Gianni Infantino’s cosy relationship with Vladimir Putin, it conspicuously chose not to describe the current horrors being beamed on to our TV screens from Ukraine as the fallout from an illegal invasion or act of war. “Fifa can confirm it has received a request from the Ukrainian Association of Football today to postpone their matches scheduled for March,” it revealed. “Fifa remains in regular contact with Uefa and the Scottish Football Association to find an appropriate solution. Fifa expresses its deepest solidarity to everybody affected by what is happening in Ukraine. A further update will be provided in due course.” With “what is happening in Ukraine” unlikely to stop any time soon, Fifa appears to be buying itself time while it mulls over a resolution that will be acceptable to Scotland, Ukraine, Wales and Austria without compromising what passes for the integrity of the HRWC. One potential solution is to kick the official Fifa-approved Coca-Cola can down the road and hope the game can be played in June, a scenario that could kibosh Infantino’s grand plan to stage the group stage draw on 1 April in Doha. The Scottish FA has also released a statement and offered Ukraine the use of facilities in the very unlikely event they are able to round up a squad and make their way to Glasgow later this month.

3/5/2022,"History has broken into a sprint. Changes that were imagined to be the work of generations, or even centuries, have happened in days. Geopolitical shifts whose impact will endure for decades have come in hours. All wars are accelerants, but Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is remaking the world before our very eyes. Start with national identity. The way nations see themselves, and are seen by others, is meant to be the stuff of evolution: slow and gradual, the layers added in increments. And yet Russia’s brutal attempt to swallow up its neighbour has changed something profound in little more than a week. When Putin set out his case for war, he rested it on the claim that Ukraine had no tradition of “genuine statehood”. That was gross, but it betrayed a prejudice that Putin did not invent. Long before the Russian ethno-nationalism of today, Ukraine was treated as something less than a nation. In the 20th century, it was caught between the totalitarianisms of the age, squeezed and bloodied by both Nazism and Bolshevism. Even in polite, western company, the view that it was merely a region of somewhere else persisted: it lived on, unconsciously perhaps, in those who called it “the Ukraine”. That ended a week ago. Ukrainians have acquired a new place in the global imagination, as the embodiment of the spirit of national independence. Already their collective defiance and bravery in the face of a terrifying menace is the material of myth – ballet dancers grabbing rifles, data scientists digging trenches – that will be woven into a national story Ukrainians will tell themselves for centuries. Even when, for the rest of the world, that fades into history, one fact will be left: the unshakeable conviction that Ukraine is a nation, a wholly “genuine” one. Count that as just the first of many ways in which Putin’s mission has already defeated itself. Some of the others are wholly unexpected. As recently as a fortnight ago, chastened by its past, Germany’s settled position was that it would play no part in a war in Europe. Now, hailing a “turning point in the history of our continent,” Germany’s chancellor is sending missiles and anti-tank weapons to help Ukraine, and massively increasing Berlin’s defence spending. There was a time when the prospect of a rearmed Germany would have sent tremors through Europe and beyond. But this week the bestselling Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari called German leadership in the current fight against Russian aggression “the best atonement” for Nazi crimes. This was no time to be neutral or to stay on the sidelines, Harari said: “What we need from Germany is to stand tall and lead.” Berlin’s break from nearly eight decades of postwar restraint is perhaps the most concrete example of a phenomenon visible throughout Europe and across the Atlantic. After many years spent contemplating its own decline and decay, the west has rediscovered something like pride and purpose. For all its many flaws and well-documented failings, it has been reminded that its brand of freedom and democracy is preferable to the alternative: the tyranny and oppression meted out by Putin, whether in the form of bombs raining down on Ukrainian civilians or gags across the mouths and blindfolds across the eyes of Russian citizens. Over the last 10 days, those who thought Nato was a cold war anachronism have been given a refresher course in why it was invented and why it was necessary: to protect free nations from a mighty aggressor. The same goes for the European Union. Britons, especially, came to associate the EU with trade at best, pettifogging bureaucracy at worst. When the EU won the Nobel peace prize in 2012, many scratched their heads with incomprehension. Well, there’s no excuse for bafflement now. Putin has jogged our memories that the EU was founded out of the conviction that the only future for a continent that had been at the centre of two world wars in 30 years was to come together: to share sovereignty rather than to kill for it. The sight of a khaki-clad Volodymyr Zelenskiy signing Ukraine’s request to join the EU, even as Russian forces approached, demonstrated again that for Europeans, the EU has always been about safety and peace. How shaming to think of the Eurosceptics who pretended the EU was some kind of foreign occupier, referring to it as the “EUSSR”. How shaming to think that the British contribution to this noble postwar ideal was to abandon it. Even the way we think of history has changed over these last few days. Long disdained has been any analysis that places too much weight on the role of individuals: in place of the “great man theory” of history, scholars were meant to focus on the deeper, impersonal forces, the tectonic shifts that made the actions of this or that human being of secondary importance. And yet, most now agree that “Russia” has no burning appetite to seize Ukraine; few ordinary Russians are itching to bring hell and heartache to their neighbours next door. This war is instead the whim of one, possibly crazed, man. For all the hours spent and ink spilled analysing the geopolitics of Russia and its region, what it comes down to is Putin’s yearning for power and for a place in history, to be remembered alongside Peter the Great. Because of one individual and his strange psychological need, a million people are already refugees and whole cities are smouldering ruins. Standing against him is a man who has inspired his nation and won admiration around the world. Perhaps Ukraine would have held out no matter who served as its president. Maybe the world’s sympathies would have been aroused even without a master communicator in Kyiv, who in a series of short, plain-spoken speeches has articulated a fundamental principle: that all nations have the right to define who they are and determine their own destiny. Perhaps. But the presence of Zelenskiy, his refusal to save his own skin or put himself first – “I need ammunition, not a ride” – has not only galvanised his own people. It has given a moral clarity to this moment. In an unheroic age, he has become a global hero and, with Putin apparently eager to play his part as a cartoonishly evil villain, that has lent this conflict a simplicity that will easily be dismissed as simplistic, but has great power all the same. None of this is any comfort to the families in basements, for the children without fathers. It doesn’t help them if history has picked up its tempo. Like all victims of war, they want nothing more than for history to leave them alone – and let them live.

3/5/2022,"For a growing number of Russia’s richest and most powerful men, now would be a very bad time to take their private jets and superyachts to their mansions in the United States. Yesterday, the White House announced it would expand the list of Russian oligarchs subject to full blocking sanctions – the highest level of restrictions – as it ramps up punishment against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. Some of the newly named oligarchs overlapped with a list of Russian elites on whom the European Union imposed sanctions earlier this week, although there were some notable differences. The federal government won’t just stop at freezing these targets’ assets, but will seize them, Joe Biden announced in his State of the Union address on Tuesday. In charge of appropriating these assets will be KleptoCapture, a newly announced justice department taskforce, with support from the treasury department, FBI, IRS and other federal agencies. Under US law, the justice department may use civil forfeiture to confiscate the proceeds from foreign crimes, including corruption, when they are found in the United States. Their efforts will complement those of a transatlantic taskforce announced over the weekend between the United States, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, Canada and the European Commission. “We are joining with our European allies to find and seize your yachts, your luxury apartments, your private jets. We are coming for your ill-begotten gains,” Biden said. The Feds may have their work cut out. US regulations are lax when it comes to requiring disclosures of real estate transactions by foreign individuals, making the country a prime destination for Russian’s uber-rich looking to snap up prime properties without scrutiny. Other favorite toys of oligarchs like planes and boats are commonly registered through shell companies. And many of those luxury craft have begun traveling toward extradition-free territories such as the Maldives, according to Bloomberg News. Here’s an introduction to the Russian oligarchs now joining the US sanctions list – as well as a few others who haven’t been targeted yet, but have notable US ties. Russians know Alisher Usmanov as one of Vladimir Putin’s “favorite” oligarchs. The country’s richest man until 2015, Usmanov owns a majority stake in Russia’s second-largest phone network, MegFon, and a large stake in the iron and steel giant Metalloinvest. But few Americans know that Usmanov also helped give us Facebook. The billionaire began investing in the social network in 2009, when Zuckerberg’s firm was having trouble accessing funding in the wake of the financial crisis. Usmanov ultimately poured over $900m into the firm, owning as much as 10% of the company before selling his stake in 2014 and netting himself billions. He was also a major investor in Apple, Twitter, LinkedIn, Groupon and Zynga. Usmanov was subjected to sanctions by the EU on Monday, and on Wednesday German authorities seized his $600m megayacht, the Dilbar – which boasts the world’s largest yacht-based indoor swimming pool. He’s now reportedly being considered for sanctions by the US. The oligarch still has a $200m private Airbus A340. Long before brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg became two of Russia’s wealthiest tycoons, they were teenage Vladimir Putin’s judo training buddies, a role they continued into adulthood. Clearly they were good at it, because after Putin became president he rewarded the brothers with the control of large state-owned enterprises and lucrative contracts, netting them a massive fortune. The Rotenbergs have since built a huge family empire of international investments under a web of shell companies, which has made Arkady’s son Igor a billionaire in his own right. Despite Arkady and Boris getting US sanctions after Russia’s 2014 invasion of Crimea, the brothers “continued actively participating in the US art market by purchasing over $18 million in art in the months following the imposition of sanctions”, according to a US Senate report. Rotenberg-linked shell companies continued making transactions in the US financial system worth over $91m long after the sanctions, according to the report. In addition to Arkady and Boris, Igor and five additional family members were added to the US sanctions list this week. Russia’s deputy prime minister from 2008 to 2018, Igor Shuvalov is now the chairman of VEB, the Russian development bank that finances major infrastructure projects, including the Sochi Olympics. He has claimed to be one of Russia’s cleanest officials, telling media he transferred all his wealth to Russia in 2013, and only kept it offshore before that to avoid spoiling his kids. But an investigation by the anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny found that Shuvalov, through a shell company, bought two London luxury apartments in 2014 for $11.4m and has used a secret private jet to fly his wife’s corgis around the world because, as one of his staffers explained, “it’s not that comfortable in business class”. He won’t be able to fly his corgis as many places now that he’s on the US and EU’s sanctions lists. Legend has it Yevgeniy Prigozhin began his rise to power selling hot dogs, shortly after getting released from prison for robbery. The wiener venture was apparently a smash hit, and within years he had opened high-end restaurants that counted Russia’s leader among their clientele, earning him the nickname of “Putin’s chef” and catapulting him into the inner circles of Russia’s elite. Americans might be more familiar with another one of Prigozhin’s businesses: the Internet Research Agency, which employed a troll army that began by supporting Russia’s 2014 invasion of Crimea, before turning its efforts to influencing the 2016 US presidential election in favor of Donald Trump. Prigozhin and the Internet Research Agency were indicted by a US grand jury in 2018 for interfering with the election, and he was added to an FBI wanted list in 2021. He’s now on both the US and EU sanctions lists for running disinformation campaigns to support Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. A former KGB officer who befriended Vladimir Putin in the 1980s while living in the same apartment building, Sergey Chemezov rose through Russia’s public and private sector in Putin’s wake, and in 2007 was appointed as CEO of Russia’s state-owned defense giant Rostec, a position he still holds today. Chemezov was sanctioned by the US in 2014 amid Rostec’s role as a supplier for Russia’s invasion of Crimea, and Washington is targeting him again, now with his family members. According to investigative reports and allegations from the jailed activist Alexei Navalny, Chemezov’s relatives have used shell companies to accumulate eye-watering assets, including superyachts and luxury villas around the world. But Chemezov says he’s clean, telling Russian media in 2019: “I do not accumulate wealth. I don’t stuff money in the corners. I don’t have yachts or airplanes.” Another former KGB officer who served alongside Putin and Chemezov, Nikolai Tokarev took over former Soviet state assets as Putin built his political power, and in 2007 became the head of the state-controlled oil giant Transneft. The oligarch has used his position at Transneft to build a business and real estate empire, which reportedly includes sponsoring an extremely fancy palace that’s said to be personally used by Putin. Tokarev was hit by US and EU sanctions this week. Reportedly the second richest man in Russia, the banker, metals mining tycoon and former deputy prime minister Vladimir Potanin was among a small circle of oligarchs who met with Putin last week as the invasion of Ukraine began. Potanin has played a big role in American arts: he has been a board member of New York’s Guggenheim Museum for two decades, until he stepped down on Wednesday. He has also given millions to the Kennedy Center in Washington, which carved his name into a wall. He is also known to have owned property in New York City, which came to light during a divorce fight that could cost him $7bn. Potanin isn’t currently under US sanctions, which is good news for his three megayachts and two private jets (that we know about). Russia’s richest man in 2016, Leonid Mikhelson is the founder and chairman of natural gas producer Novatek, a close friend of Putin’s, and a business partner of Gennady Timchenko, a billionaire who has been under US sanctions since 2014. Mikhelson loves art: along with his $200m art collection, he joined the board of trustees at New York’s New Museum in 2013, and has sponsored exhibitions at the Art Institute of Chicago and London’s Tate Modern. His ostentatious superyacht, the Pacific, can reportedly accommodate two helicopters. But his other assets may be harder to trace. In 2017, the Panama Papers revealed that Mikhelson had used an intricate system of shell companies to secretly register a $65m Gulfstream private jet in the United States, which in most cases requires US citizenship or permanent residency. The tycoon is not currently subject to sanctions, though his company Novatek is. Petr Aven is the head of Alfa Group, a commercial bank subject to US sanctions that helped him amass an estimated $5.5bn fortune. A well-known collector of classical Russian paintings, Aven has lent works from his collection – reportedly worth $200m – to New York’s Museum of Modern Art and the Neue Galerie. Aven reportedly has never bought a plane or yacht, and told the FT “all my money goes in to art.” That is, of course, if you don’t count the millions he spent transforming an 8.5-acre plot in England into a “KGB-proof” mansion, complete with a bomb-proof panic room. Last year, Aven filed a libel lawsuit against HarperCollins for a book it published about Vladimir Putin’s rise, Putin’s People. Aven was sanctioned on Monday by the EU, which described him as “one of Vladimir Putin’s closest oligarchs” and one of “approximately 50 wealthy Russian businessmen who regularly meet with Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin”. He has not yet been placed under sanctions by the US or UK. Petr Aven’s business partner, Mikhail Fridman, is Alfa Group’s founder and a Ukrainian-born Russian oligarch. Fridman has made substantial investments in the United States, which include spending a reported $1bn in 2011 to buy up distressed properties across the east coast, telling the Wall Street Journal at the time, “The American market is the most well-regulated and liquid market in the world. It has the best protection for investor rights.” Through Fridman’s investment group, LetterOne, the billionaire also sank $200m into Uber, and $50m into the telecom startup FreedomPop. Fridman also caused a stir in 2018 when he spoke alongside Aven at a closed-door dinner hosted by the Atlantic Council, a major US foreign policy thinktank, in what critics saw as an unofficial Kremlin mission to protest against US sanctions. Last week, Fridman became one of the first oligarchs to speak out against the invasion of Ukraine, calling it a “tragedy” and writing that “war can never be the answer.” Nonetheless, Fridman was subjected to sanctions on Monday by the EU, which named him as “a top Russian financier and enabler of Putin’s inner circle”. Like Aven, he has not yet been placed under sanctions by the US or UK. The oligarch has a son, Alexander, who is reportedly attending NYU’s Stern business school, after a stint in Moscow selling hookah. Currently Russia’s richest man, Alexei Mordashov owns a third of Tui, Europe’s biggest tourism firm, and gained his billions as the chief executive of Russia’s largest steel and mining firm, Severstal. He is also a large shareholder of the Bank of Rossiya, which has opened up branches across Russia-occupied Ukrainian territory in recent years. Over the last two decades, the billionaire has also poured money into the United States, investing heavily through Severstal in steel companies in the midwest before selling them for $2.3bn in 2014. Mordashov has been hit with sanctions by the EU, but the US hasn’t taken action yet. They would be interested in his Bombardier Global 6000 private jet and multiple superyachts, including the $500m Nord, which Senator Bernie Sanders noted on Tuesday had been “sailing in the Seychelles region for more than 10 days” in a Twitter thread about Russian offshore wealth. Roman Abramovich, the longtime owner of Chelsea FC, has been described by a member of the UK parliament as a “key enabler” of Putin’s regime, which Abramovich has long denied. An orphan raised by his grandparents in Siberia, Abramovich pulled himself up by his bootstraps the old-fashioned way: wriggling into the inner circles of government and then profiting hugely by selling previously state-owned assets that he acquired after the fall of the Soviet Union. The billionaire owns one of the world’s most outlandish yachts, complete with an onboard submarine and three helicopters. He has also owned a number of ultra-expensive properties in the United States, including a trio of buildings in New York City’s Upper East Side worth more than $90m combined, which he transferred to his third wife, Darya Zhukova, in 2018. Abramovich is not currently under western sanctions. Earlier, the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, told the House of Commons that Abramovich was “already facing sanctions” though later said he “misspoke”.",News/World news,"Meet the oligarchs: the Russian billionaires whose jets, yachts and mansions are now in the crosshairs",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/meet-the-oligarchs-sanctions-russian-billionaires

3/5/2022,"Royal Mail is increasing the price of a first-class stamp by 10p to 95p in an inflation-busting hike blamed on declining letter volumes and rising costs. The near 12% price increase will come into effect on 4 April when the cost of a second-class stamp will also rise by 2p to 68p. Royal Mail said the number of letters it handled had fallen by more 60% since the peak in the mid-2000s and by about a fifth since the start of the pandemic. Nick Landon, the group’s chief commercial officer, said Royal Mail understood many companies and households were “finding it hard in the current economic environment”, adding: “We will always keep our prices as affordable as possible.” However, he said: “We need to carefully balance our pricing against declining letter volumes and increasing costs of delivering to a growing number of addresses six days a week. As customer needs change and we see a greater shift from letters to parcels, it is vital that the universal service adapts to stay relevant and sustainable.” While the number of letters Royal Mail’s postal workers delivered had declined from the high of 20bn in 2004-2005 to about 7bn today, Landon said over that same period the number of addresses it served has increased by about 3.5m. Inflation reached 5.5% in January, the highest level since the early 1990s,. Economists have said it could hit 8% this year as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine fuels a worsening energy crisis. At the start of this year Royal Mail said it was laying off 700 managers in an effort to cut costs after a grim Christmas when deliveries were disrupted by high sickness levels caused by the spread of the Omicron variant of Covid-19. The job cuts would save £40m a year, said Royal Mail, which employs 140,000 people.

3/5/2022,"Anna Sorokin, the woman who scammed victims out of hundreds of thousands of dollars by falsely posing as a German heiress, has sued Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), saying she contracted Covid after officials denied her multiple requests for a booster shot. According to the class-action lawsuit filed in federal court on Tuesday by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Sorokin, along with three other plaintiffs, filed the suit against Ice’s acting director, Tae Johnson, the Department of Homeland Security and its secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, reported NBC News. The complaint alleges that Sorokin, also known as Anna Delvey and the subject of the Netflix series Inventing Anna, tested positive in January after several requests for a booster shot were ignored by officials. The lawsuit claims Sorokin experienced “a fever, persistent cough, nausea, migraines, and body aches”. Sorokin’s lawyers say she felt the lingering effects of her infection – including fatigue, brain fog, shortness of breath and coughing – after leaving quarantine on 29 January. Sorokin says she has several health problems, including a chronic kidney infection, depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. Her lawyers say she was more vulnerable to serious infection or death as a result. An Ice representative told NBC News the agency follows all CDC protocols related to Covid. The lawsuit claims Ice has not adopted any policy related to booster shots, even as the CDC recommends booster shots for all eligible inmates. Sorokin was referred to the ACLU by another non-profit, said the ACLU lawyer Arthur Spitzer. “We were not looking to put fireworks around her name,” Spitzer told Reuters, but “we thought to the extent that her involvement brings additional attention to the problem, it’s a plus for everyone and not just for her.” In a statement, Sorokin underscored her fear of contracting Covid a second time. “I joined this lawsuit because everyone who wants a booster shot to protect themselves should be able to get one,” she said. Sorokin’s co-plaintiffs include Ramon Dominguez Gonzalez, 32, Kenet Jefet Hernandez Herrera, 24, and Miguel Angel Escalante, 36, Arizona, reported NBC. The plaintiffs are hoping to represent a nationwide class of incarcerated people who are 55 or older or have higher risk of serious illness or death from Covid-19, reported Reuters. Sorokin was released in February 2021 after being sentenced to between four and 12 years in prison for theft of services, grand larceny and attempted grand larceny.

3/5/2022,"The new Labour MP for Birmingham Erdington has said her byelection victory shows the party is “finally turning a corner” after she secured the seat with a majority of 3,266. Paulette Hamilton, a former nurse, will become the city’s first black MP after getting 9,413 votes, beating the Conservative candidate, Robert Alden, who got 6,147. Labour’s vote share rose to 55.5% from 50.3% in 2019. “We heard the issues, we shared our policies and I believe the Labour party is finally turning a corner … Labour policies are now actually seeping through,” she told the Guardian after the result was announced in the early hours of Friday. “This byelection has shown that with the right campaign, with listening to what the public are telling us and acting upon that [the party can secure more success].” The contest was triggered by the sudden death in January of Jack Dromey, who had held the seat for Labour since 2010. After the result was announced, Hamilton paid tribute to the late MP, saying: “He was a wonderful MP for his constituency and in the past few weeks campaigning across Erdington, Castle Vale and Kingstanding, I have heard so many stories of the difference Jack made to the people’s lives.” Labour was the favourite to win, having held the constituency since it was created in 1974, but the Conservatives increased their vote share in recent years and there were jitters a low turnout could produce a surprise result. In her victory speech, Hamilton said: “I’m truly humbled and honoured to be elected as a member of parliament. I will not take your vote for granted. I have met many of you and I have heard what you have to say and I commit to you now: I will work for you … I will be your voice in Westminster.” Hamilton said the party had been expecting a comfortable victory. “We were confident that with knocking every door and doing what we needed to do, we would secure the win,” she said. “But we knew we couldn’t be complacent, we knew we had to fight for every vote, because people needed to hear our voice.” Turnout was low, at 27%, with a total of 17,016 ballots cast – fewer than the 17,720 votes Dromey received in 2019. Alden, Hamilton’s main rival, has fought the seat for the past four general elections, and is leader of the Tory group on the city council. Dromey, who was married to the former Labour cabinet minister Harriet Harman, held the seat with a majority of 3,601 in 2019 when the Conservatives made significant gains in the region, including taking the former Labour stronghold Birmingham Northfield. Hamilton, 59, is the cabinet member for health and social care on Labour-controlled Birmingham city council and has lived in the seat for 35 years. After a smooth campaign, on the eve of the vote comments emerged that were made by Hamilton in 2015 at an event called “The Ballot or the Bullet – does your vote count?” “I’m not sure we will get what we really deserve in this country using the vote,” she said. “But I don’t know if we are a strong enough group to get what we want to get if we have an uprising … I am very torn.” Labour said the comments were “misrepresented and taken out of context as part of a deliberate attempt by the Conservatives and their allies to hijack a democratic election … These attacks on a black woman seeking to become the city’s first black MP are deeply disturbing.” On Friday Hamilton said she had received “horrendous” abuse online as a result and added: “I could start an argument or discussion about it. But the community that I serve deserves a fresh start, we need to move on and something that is seven years old, we need to leave that there.”",News/UK news,Birmingham Erdington byelection winner is Labour’s Paulette Hamilton,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/04/birmingham-erdington-byelection-winner-is-labours-paulette-hamilton
3/5/2022,"As the events in Ukraine escalate – and fears of nuclear conflict ratchet up to cold war levels – children may need extra reassurance. But, say experts, the extreme nature of the crisis means carers should look at specialist techniques to help calm anxieties. Mike Hughesman, a former principal educational psychologist for Service Children’s Education who has worked with children whose parents and carers are in active combat in Afghanistan and Germany, said that in acute contexts like these, it is “vital that we source advice on the lived experiences of families that have faced adversity and learned to deal with it successfully. “Too much advice is based on the study of patients who have experienced difficulty and found it hard to cope with adversity,” he said. “Not enough is based on study of the lived experiences of families and individuals that succeed against the odds.” Hughesman recommends solution-focused therapy. “It empowers people to seek out what helps them to succeed, rather than dwell on all the reasons why they haven’t,” he said. Support local charities There are several Ukrainian charities working on the ground. Sunflower of Peace is a charity that helps paramedics and doctors, and has been fundraising for supplies, which includes first aid medical tactical backpacks. United Help Ukraine focuses on providing medical supplies and humanitarian aid, and raising awareness of the conflict. Voices of Children aims to help children affected by the war in eastern Ukraine, providing support through art therapy, psychologists, video storytelling and a number of other methods. The British Red Cross has launched an emergency appeal to help Ukraine. The charity will be updating its webpage with news on the work its team is doing, and how support will be used to help people. Support local journalism English-language news outlets based in the country, such as Kyiv Independent and the New Voice of Ukraine, are covering developments on the ground as the conflict unfolds, using local journalists. The Kyiv Independent says it was created by journalists in order to defend editorial independence. This site on Twitter covers many local journalists in Ukraine. Write to your local MP This can be a way to lobby the British government to place further sanctions on the Russian government and its associates. You can get in touch with your local MP via email or post to their constituency address. Instructions on how to get in touch can be found on parliament.uk. In short, he said, parents and carers must deal first with their children’s emotions before calmly exploring the facts as the children themselves see them. The next steps are to help children stay grounded on a day-to-day basis through routines. “Finally,” he said. “We need to find ways to help them be proactive and overcome their sense of powerlessness.” Prof Vivian Hill, programme director at UCL Institute of Education’s department of psychology and human development, warned that fake news on social media can make the situation feel even more frightening and unpredictable than it is already. “It is important to reassure children and talk to them in a way that reflects their age and understanding,” she added. “Don’t overcomplicate things for younger children: stick to the facts. Older children may want to discuss political and historical events. Use reliable sources to support this process. Children are best supported by people they can trust but they may feel too frightened to even ask about this so be sensitive to their mood.” She recommended talking to children about diplomacy, how nobody wants there to be a nuclear attack and everything possible will be done to find a safer way to resolve this conflict. “Try to remain optimistic,” she said. “Keep to routines, do pleasurable and diverting activities with your children.” To remain optimistic, Hill said it was important for parents and carers to be aware of their own feelings and to get support from friends and family. “Some may be able to lean on support from older generations who have lived through the cold war and have direct experiences to draw on,” she said. Judith Wenban-Smith, a forensic psychologist with a special interest in families, advised that it was important to acknowledge to a child how worrying it can be to think about nuclear weapons but that they should be reassured that all countries have nuclear weapons held in very safe ways and are determined not to use them. “Then encourage the child to do something, like join CND, ask for a school assembly on the subject, contribute to a campaign or fundraiser,” she said. “Parents should not dominate the conversation: encourage the child to talk and respond to their worries specifically.”",News/World news,"Reassure children about Russia-Ukraine war with resilience tales, say experts",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/reassure-children-about-russia-ukraine-war-with-resilience-tales-say-experts
3/5/2022,"When senior British officers visited Moscow in the days before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the chief of the Russian general staff, Valery Gerasimov, boasted that he commanded the second most powerful army in the world. A week into the conflict, however, the Russian military has been performing abysmally. The gap between Russian military expectations and its actual performance shows what it has and has not learned over the last 14 years of military modernisation, and how it is likely to continue its war in Ukraine. After its unsatisfactory combat performance during the invasion of Georgia in 2008 the Russian military embarked upon a sustained programme of rearmament. Russia poured around $159bn a year into its armed forces when measured on the basis of purchasing power parity (PPP). That has created a force with a vast fleet of modernised main battle tanks, artillery, air defences, and long-range cruise and ballistic missiles. Whereas in the cold war the Soviet army expected to depend upon nuclear weapons to win any high-intensity conflict, the modern Russian army aspired to fight with speed and precision. Parallel to this rearmament was a growth in the conceptual importance of non-lethal military activity. Obsessed with “colour revolutions” the Russian military set about using intelligence officers and special forces to try to divide adversary societies from within. The theory was that if an enemy’s forces can be turned on themselves, if information can be controlled, and if trust in a country’s leaders can be undermined, then victory could be achieved with a minimal use of force. Russian military operations since 2008 had partly validated Russia’s expectations. In Crimea in 2014 the combination of information operations and speed saw the peninsula seized almost without fighting. In the Donbas region and in Syria, the Russian military found itself with contained conflicts against enemies who could not effectively strike back. In Syria this was because of the limitations of the Syrian opposition’s capabilities. In Donbas it was because Ukraine was politically deterred from decisive counterattacks by the threat of escalation. In these combat laboratories Russia practised integrating electronic warfare and artillery, began to link up its special forces and its air force, and demonstrated that it could manufacture and field precision weapons. It is important to note the limitations of Russia’s experiences in Donbas and Syria, however. First, the scale of Russian operations in both countries was small. The Russian air force may have bombed hospitals precisely, but it did so with flights of two to four aircraft during the day against an adversary with very limited air defences. Russian ground forces rarely operated in larger formations than company groups of a couple of hundred people. These were also disproportionately special forces or mercenaries. They were not always brave, but they were psychologically prepared for combat. The invasion of Ukraine is a very different war. Russia has deployed more than 190,000 personnel against a Ukrainian military of more than 200,000 soldiers and many more volunteers. Just preventing units becoming ensnared in massive traffic jams requires a feat of planning and coordination. Against an enemy with an air force and air defences Russian pilots must fly low level, at night, and still synchronise passes by multiple aircraft against their targets without crashing into one another. Doing this reliably requires a lot of experience and training. While some Russian units are highly proficient, the skills of the forces it has sent into Ukraine vary wildly. The cause of Russia’s military debacle in Ukraine however lies in its callousness towards human life, Ukrainian and Russian. Throughout the war in Donbas, the families of Russian soldiers killed in action were told their relatives had died in training accidents. In Syria, Russia orchestrated the targeting of civilian infrastructure to break the will of the resistance, while waging a relentless propaganda campaign against civilian medical organisations trying to save lives. For the Ukrainian people, watching what Russia has done to Syria and Donbas, the will to resist is strong. Putin has framed the war as the correction of a historical mistake that brought about Ukraine’s existence. The struggle is viewed by Ukrainians as existential. Russia’s attempts to divide Ukrainian society therefore have failed utterly. Russia’s ruthless treatment of its own soldiers, while concealable at a small scale, has now brought about operational repercussions. Having not told its troops that they were about to go to war, its army has been left unprepared, logistically and psychologically. Morale is low, limiting the combat power of Russian forces. With too little time to plan, Russian logistics and communications are in disarray, slowing its pace of advance. This gives the Ukrainians crucial time to prepare their defences and organise a protracted resistance. Unfortunately, the failure of Russia’s initial thrusts into Ukraine means it has now reverted to a more traditional reliance on heavy artillery and the surrounding of Ukraine’s cities. This shelling is indiscriminate and systematic. The aim is to break the will of the military and civilian defenders, depriving them of water and food and killing them with fires. This is currently being carried out against Kharkiv and Mariupol, and the Russians are trying to position themselves to similarly attack Kyiv. Putin set out to reunite a fellow people. Instead, he is making a desert and calling it peace.

3/5/2022,"Free speech amendments have been tabled for inclusion in anti-corruption legislation due before parliament next week, after ministers promised to reform Britain’s legal system to prevent “intimidation lawsuits”. The Labour MP Liam Byrne and the Conservative MP David Davis tabled two amendments to the economic crime bill, which will be put to a first vote on Monday. In a joint statement on the amendments, they said: “We’re determined to build a cross-party coalition to ensure the reforms before parliament, designed to expunge from London the problem of dirty money, ensure that oligarchs of any nation can no longer use the English legal system against ordinary citizens, journalists and civil servants to silence free speech.” The first amendment would require the government to institute an inquiry into so-called Slapp (strategic litigation against public participation) cases intended to intimidate journalists and campaigners. The second would protect an individual disclosing otherwise confidential information from the offshore property register, if they could show the disclosure was in the public interest. The main measure in the economic crime bills is the creation of a register of individuals owning UK property through offshore companies and other secrecy devices. The purpose of the register is to make it harder for criminal elements and corrupt foreign officials to launder money through London’s property sector. During a parliamentary debate on Russian sanctions on Tuesday, MPs accused three solicitors, Geraldine Proudler of CMS, Nigel Tait of Carter-Ruck and John Kelly of Harbottle & Lewis, of deliberately filing oppressive legal actions against an investigative journalist in an attempt to intimidate her. Similar allegations were also made against the barrister Hugh Tomlinson QC. The justice secretary, Dominic Raab, promised on Thursday to bring forward proposals to change the English legal system so as to prevent Slapp cases. He said: “We will not have people close to [Vladimir] Putin coming here to try and bankrupt people who shine a light on his excesses. It’s about oligarchs and kleptocrats who get together and try to sue people who shine a light.” LONDON, March 4 (Reuters) - The British government will soon put forward proposals to stop Russian oligarchs using its court system to sue those seeking to shine a light on corruption, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said on Friday There is no established legal definition of a Slapp case, though they are typically considered to refer to cases intended to deter criticism or scrutiny by exploiting England’s enormously expensive court system to harass journalists with legal costs. The four lawyers accused by the MPs of abusive practices in parliament were involved in simultaneous legal actions against Catherine Belton, the investigative journalist and former Moscow correspondent of the Financial Times. Belton published a highly acclaimed book, Putin’s People: How the KGB Took Back Russia and then Took on the West, which documented Putin’s consolidation of domestic power and his relationship with Russia’s oligarchs. The book was publicly endorsed by the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. The four lawyers all assisted various legal cases filed against against Belton or her publishers Harper Collins on behalf of different Russian clients. Both Kelly and Tait said it was unfair to describe their legal work as Slapps, because such cases were generally defined as being groundless, while Belton and HarperCollins had settled complaints from their respective clients Roman Abramovich and the oil firm Rosneft. The lawyers said they had not coordinated their respective legal actions. Further allegations were also made against Proudler, who sued the anti-corruption activist Bill Browder on behalf of a Russian police officer in 2013 after Browder accused him of participating in a fraud on his investment firm, Hermitage Capital Management. In the January debate on abusive litigation practices, Byrne said the police officer’s annual salary at the time he hired Proudler was between £15,000 and £20,000, while her legal firm charged £600 a hour. Byrne said the officer failed to pay his legal bill after losing his case. “There must be some kind of weakness there, which we need to fix if we are to ensure that lawyers can genuinely understand the source of the money that is paying their bills,” the MP said. Proudler did not respond to questions from the Guardian about the allegations made against her in parliament. She resigned this week from both the board of the Guardian Foundation, the charitable arm of the media group’s parent company, as well as from the Scott Trust review panel, which adjudicates editorial complaints. “Geraldine Proudler, whose term of office was due to end in April 2022, has now stepped down from the Guardian Foundation board after nine years,” a spokesperson for the foundation said. “The Guardian Foundation is very grateful for her many years of service.”",News/World news,Move to add free speech protections to UK anti-corruption bill,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/free-speech-protections-uk-anti-corruption-bill-economic-crime-oligarchs-intimidation-lawsuits
