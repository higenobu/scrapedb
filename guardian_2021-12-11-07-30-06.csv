12/11/2021,"Thomas Frank could have been forgiven for thinking his luck had run out. But after a testing few weeks that have seen his side struggle for the fluency that came so easily earlier in the season, the Brentford manager watched on in delight as Pontus Jansson and then a Bryan Mbeumo penalty secured an unlikely comeback victory. Leading through a seventh goal of the season from Emmanuel Dennis in the first half, Claudio Ranieri must have thought a first away win of the season was in touching distance until the Sweden defender struck with six minutes to play. Mbeumo’s injury-time penalty will have felt like a dagger to the veteran manager’s heart.  The first ever top-flight meeting between these clubs was always likely to be a tense affair given the stakes. While Brentford came into the game having only managed one league win since the start of October, Watford have just ended a run of fixtures against Arsenal, Manchester United, Leicester, Chelsea and Manchester City in succession. They were still without the services of injured forward Ismaïla Sarr, while Danny Rose was left out in favour of Jeremy Ngakia after the former England left-back was criticised for his lack of fitness by Ranieri this week. For Brentford – who had confirmed earlier in the day that the club’s co-director of football Rasmus Ankersen is set to leave – the absence of top scorer Ivan Toney for the second match in a row due to Covid meant Frank turned to Bryan Mbeumo to lead the line. The forward has the dubious record of having struck the woodwork seven times already this season – more than any other player – but has found the net just twice in the league since Brentford’s promotion. The instinctive shot from Sheldon Baptiste in the third minute that Daniel Bachmann did well to tip over the bar gave an early indication that the hosts meant business on a chilly night in west London. The Austria international produced an even better save to deny Mbeumo’s curler from just outside the box and it proved vital as Watford subsequently took the lead. Joshua King’s shot took a deflection before striking the post and being cleared out. The following corner was taken by Tom Cleverley and headed home by an unmarked Dennis. Such are the margins in this division. Spurred by an enthusiastic home crowd, Brentford attempted to respond but – also missing the suspended Sergi Canós – lacked the creativity to break down a stubborn Watford defence and only looked truly dangerous on the break. One such linkup between Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa five minutes before the break led to a corner that saw Charlie Goode nod over from close range. Brentford’s victory here last season as both clubs ended up securing promotion was their first over these opponents since they did the double against Watford in the 1976/77 Division Four campaign. Judging by Frank’s reaction at the start of the second half, after watching another move break down, the Brentford manager is only too aware of how crucial encounters like this could prove by the end of the season. Yet aside from one sliced clearance from Bachmann under pressure from Wissa, the hosts could not build any real pressure until well past the hour mark when a Rico Henry cross was bundled away to safety. With the introduction of both Saman Ghoddos and Marcus Forss off the bench, Brentford finally seemed to click into gear and two opportunities in the space of 30 seconds almost saw them equalise, only for Bachmann to produce another save to deny Vitaly Janelt. A breakaway then saw King presented with a golden chance to seal the victory after being set up by Dennis but his shot was disappointing, albeit from a tight angle. That was to prove crucial as Jansson’s late header from Janelt’s cross saw them equalise before Mbeumo did the rest from the spot.",Sport/Football,Bryan Mbeumo’s last-gasp penalty gives Brentford fightback win over Watford,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/10/brentford-watford-premier-league-match-report
12/11/2021,"A penny for Warren Gatland’s thoughts. Afforded the freedom of Franklin’s Gardens, Finn Russell delved into his box of magic tricks and produced a masterful performance to steer Racing 92 to an emphatic victory over Northampton. It may not be an entirely fair comparison given Dan Biggar was feeding off scraps but when Russell is in this mood you cannot but wonder what might have been had he worn the British & Irish Lions No10 jersey against South Africa last summer. He produced the telling pass for four of Racing’s five tries and carved Northampton open with his cunning and craft. It helps to be the lynchpin of a side that boasts so much star power and on this evidence Racing 92, the three-times Champions Cup runners-up, are going to take some stopping this season. One walloping does not make a winter but the English challenge in Europe is off to an inauspicious start and to compound matters for Northampton, Biggar limped off in considerable pain early in the second half.  Facing the team who scored the most tries and the most points last season, despite going out in the quarter-finals, Northampton needed a solid start to settle themselves. They managed precisely the opposite with the hooker Sam Matavesi inexplicably attempting a chipped over the defence near his own line. He was charged down by the excellent Yoan Tanga and though disaster was averted – the Racing No 8 could not ground the ball – the tone had been set. Five minutes into the match and Maxime Machenaud had notched two penalties. Three minutes later and Racing had their first try – Russell prising open the shellshocked Northampton defence by exchanging passes with Kurtley Beale before releasing Wenceslas Lauret to burst over. Machenaud converted for an ominously early 13-0 lead. Northampton had not been out of their half hitherto and though they carved themselves promising positions at times, already there was an air of panic about them. They kicked to the corner when Biggar really should have gone for goal and found themselves further behind when the Racing pack bulldozed their way to another breakdown penalty – Machenaud on target again. Russell was again the provider for Racing’s second try, once more creating the gap with an inside pass to Juan Imhoff, who had the pace to dart under the posts. A few moments earlier Russell had demonstrated his delicate touch with a fine chip over the top after Northampton had again coughed the ball up cheaply. When Machenaud converted Imhoff’s try Racing were ticking along at a point a minute. Northampton registered their first points just before the half hour with Courtnall Skosan finishing off a fine move – in which Matt Proctor was prominent in the buildup – but Racing responded with try number three and a second for Imhoff, with Russell once again the creator. Racing had built up a head of steam with a driving maul and had the penalty advantage when Russell floated an inch-perfect pass to Beale – every bit as measured as that unforgettable bit of skill against England at Murrayfield – before the Australian released Imhoff on the left. Machenaud could not convert this team, meaning Racing took a 21-point lead into the half-time interval. Less than two minutes into the second half and Russell was at it again, this time showing his running skills by slaloming down the right wing before freeing Lauret for his second try with a sumptuous offload. Biggar limped off soon after but Northampton, to their credit, responded with a try under the posts through Fraser Dingwall. Machenaud added another penalty and Lauret had his hat-trick when Racing and Russell again demonstrated their ability to move through the gears – the Scot freeing Gael Fickou, who breached the Northampton line before finding the supporting Tanga, who shipped on to his fellow back-row. That Lewis Ludlam’s determined solo score was chalked off only summed up Saints’ night.",Sport/Sport,Finn Russell shines as sorry Saints are demolished by Racing 92,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/10/finn-russell-impresses-as-sorry-northampton-are-demolished-by-racing
12/11/2021,"The secret to Marcus Smith’s rapid rise over the past 12 months is be found inside the notebooks he has spent years filling with his innermost thoughts. He still finds it helpful to write down his hopes and dreams even if, to others, it reads like a fantasy wish list. “I’m a big believer that if you constantly write your goals down you set your mind on to something. If you set your mind properly you can almost achieve anything.” This time last year three of his career ambitions – winning a Premiership title with Harlequins, touring with the British & Irish Lions and starting big Test matches for England – were a long way from being realised. Quins were stuttering badly, not least in Europe. Racing 92 ripped them apart 49-7 at the Stoop shortly before Christmas, and the boyish Smith was being courted by Bath, Lyon and Toulon, among others.  And now? Like a gumshield-wearing Cinderella, Smith’s professional life has been transformed, largely through his own desire and hard work. He has started – and sparkled – at 10 for England against the world champions, South Africa, represented the Lions and inspired Quins, who visit Castres on Sunday, to a Premiership title. Not since Jonny Wilkinson has a young English rugby player had such potential to convert not just goals but a whole new non-rugby audience as well. Which makes it handy that Wilkinson now features among the young fly-half’s most trusted advisers. During England’s autumn campaign, in particular, Smith chatted regularly to his illustrious predecessor about mental preparation. “That’s the biggest thing I learn from him. How to deal with things that don’t always go your way or things that do go your way, how to live, how to be a good person.” Avoiding some of the mental angst from which Wilkinson suffered would also be a plus, which is another reason why Eddie Jones hates any semblance of hype surrounding the 22-year-old. “I have long felt that all the talk around him has not been helpful – either to England or Marcus,” wrote the head coach in his latest leadership book. The subsequent ill-judged comparisons with Emma Raducanu, the complaints about the “rat poison” allegedly spread by an over-excited media … all of it is to encourage the Philippines-born Smith to keep his visionary eyes fixed on the prize. Either way, it can be hard to scale the loftiest Twickenham peak and not have the chance to recharge afterwards. It was collectively smart thinking, then, to allow Smith to spend a week away in the winter sun with his girlfriend having experienced “a step up physically” against the Springboks. “Bigger men, aggressive defence, time on the ball was less than I’ve ever experienced before. I tried to just reflect on what happened and take some downtime to rest my brain and my body.” The year 2021, though, will for ever retain a special place in his heart. “There’s a few things I’m really proud of and all of them were goals I wrote down when I was 15 or 16. I’ve got quite a few little books I’ve written in over the years. But then you park it. I’ll never forget those three [autumn] weekends but it’s gone now. “For me it’s about refocusing every single time I get a chance and defining my goals through the season and through the years. Every single player who’s played for England will have had [extra attention] at one point. For me it’s just about surrounding myself with brilliant people who are able to share bits of wisdom with me. It’s not a straight line but as long as I continue listening and being open to their feedback then hopefully I can stay on the path I am now.” Because, with the annual “Big Game” at Twickenham on 27 December also approaching, the self-aware Smith knows he is not yet the finished article. Arguably it did not need Jones to give him a hurry-up last year – “I was not sure whether Marcus had the desire to be the best he can be … we had a reasonably blunt conversation” – because the fly-half felt similarly. “It was at a point in my career when I didn’t feel I was performing to the best of my ability, for whatever reasons. A lot of it was within. I took a long, hard look at myself, all parts of my game and my preparation. For me it wasn’t up to scratch and I tried to fix it.” It is hardly a coincidence that the regime change at Harlequins which empowered the players to assume more control has also made a massive difference. “When we were struggling at Quins it was tough. We got smashed at home a couple of times, we threw away some big leads. It wasn’t easy, and we had some honest frank conversations. The standards now are a lot higher. We don’t accept poor effort. We believe that’s a non-negotiable if you’re lucky enough to play for Harlequins. As a group we’re a lot tighter … we’re in a completely different place.” Certain things will never change, though, and the Smith family home in Brighton clearly remains a blessed sanctuary. “If I ever need an escape it’s pretty easy to go down there, eat my mum’s rice and enjoy my brothers’ company.” The youngest, Thomas, is 18 while Luc, 20, plays for Rosslyn Park and has already represented the Philippines at sevens. “I wouldn’t have done any of these things without them,” says their loyal elder sibling. “I remember loads of times when we’d go to the park and try and sidestep each other. They’d mug me off or read my sidestep which would frustrate the hell out of me.” It is all paying off now, the only question being how much higher he can soar. At some stage he likes the idea of assisting rugby in his mother’s homeland – “That would be the long term goal, to change people’s lives and make people in the Philippines happy and proud of me” – but, as ever, he has multiple other ambitions. “I want to make sure I continue to love my rugby and have a smile on my face every time I step on the field. I want to win many trophies here at Quins. At England I want to play for the next 10 years, touch wood. I want to go to the next World Cup, I want to play for the Lions again. I want to keep going.” Whenever the talented Smith makes a wish, it has a strange habit of coming true.",Sport/Sport,Marcus Smith: ‘If you set your mind properly you can almost achieve anything’,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/10/marcus-smith-interview-rugby-union-england-harlequins
12/11/2021,"What better way to symbolise your favourable turn in fortune than with adorable bunnies, the sign of good luck? Comedian Hannah Gadsby has marked her return to the Sydney Opera House with four rabbits across the stage, though you will probably first notice the one in the Joan Sutherland theatre that functions as a lantern, a beacon of hope. Of course, none of these rabbits are alive, which turns out to be apt, given the desecration of one unlucky bunny that hopped into the middle of the performer’s toxic relationship with an ex she struggled to shake off and another that emits a high-pitched squeal of terror as it crosses paths with Gadsby, her new wife and producer, Jenney Shamash, and their two dogs, Douglas and Jasper, on an outdoor stroll.  Trauma is in store only for the little furry introduced species in Gadsby’s excellent new show, Body of Work. The comedian herself, who shot to fame in the United States when her 2017 show, Nanette, aired on Netflix in 2018 – embedding deeply affecting stories of violence, homophobia and shame at the tail end of that laser-sharp comedy set – has opted here for a feel-good show, “a bit of ta-dah”, and what a joy it is. Gadsby and Shamash married in January, and Gadsby announced Shamash to her fans via Instagram in April. Sure, Body of Work is partly a love story; there’s even a cute proposal anecdote. But as she inelegantly informs Love Actually director Richard Curtis, unaware of exactly who he is, she hates romantic comedy. Gadsby doesn’t go for easy sentimentality, even while we gain insight into her loving relationship. We learn the couple ordered a shark cake, “to fuck with the Christian baker”, and that they didn’t marry for love – they already had that – but rather for the “sweet, sweet, sweet administrative privilege” that straight people enjoy. Gadsby does not miss a beat. A few years ago, she contemplated giving up standup comedy, given her career had been built on self-deprecation, which was “not humility, it’s humiliation”. What a loss her retirement would have been: having told her story and eschewed any place on the margins to which growing up in Bible belt north-west Tasmania might have otherwise relegated her, Gadsby has become a consummate storyteller, building on what she has already generously revealed of herself. The term comedian kind of sells her skills short. She doesn’t simply create tension then knock it down to make us laugh. When she tells her stories, we can almost see the players in her anecdotes materialise before us. We get affectionately told stories about Gadsby’s parents and the hilarious dynamic between them, and how her mum has dubbed Gadsby’s backpack-wearing partner “Dora the explorer” and approves of Shamash with the high accolade she is “not a dickhead”. In Gadsby’s 2019 show, Douglas, likewise streamed on Netflix the following year, she revealed her diagnosis of high-functioning autism. Now we get an insight into how she and her partner, who she calls “Jenno” and whom she met shortly after the diagnosis, creatively deal with occasions when Gadsby feels over-stimulated. Of course, there’s a man, a podcast-making “bro”, who informs Gadsby “you’re not real autistic” because she can “read social cues”. Gadsby has lost none of her relish for skewering egotistical straight white men: Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Leonardo DiCaprio finally getting an Oscar “for being mauled by a bear” in The Revenant. And yes, she addresses her recent Instagram shout out to Netflix boss Ted Sarandos, who had name checked Gadsby’s specials on the streaming service as justification for commissioning Dave Chappelle’s specials in which the US comedian repeatedly maligns transgender people. “Fuck you and your amoral algorithm cult” Gadsby posted. “I do shits with more backbone than you. That’s just a joke! I definitely didn’t cross a line because you just told the world there isn’t one.” “I bit the hand that fed me,” Gadsby admits now, reflecting on how the spat made global news, but spun comedy gold when the story was translated by Russian news services and back into English as “I do shits with more tenacity than you”. Gadsby says she was ill-prepared for fame – her endearing reaction to a spot of gift-giving by Jodie Foster illustrating her naiveté – but the unique slant she has on the world combined with the material comfort of her success and luxury of time indicates she could continue to deliver a work this strong every couple of years if she desires. She certainly has the tenacity.  Hannah Gadsby’s Body of Work is at the Sydney Opera House with two shows each on 11 and 12 December, ahead of a tour of Europe, the UK, Canada, the US and New Zealand, with performances at Arts Centre Melbourne on 26 and 28 August and 11 September 2022.",Arts/Stage,Hannah Gadsby – Body of Work: a joyful guide to blasting Netflix and messing with Christian bakers,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/dec/11/hannah-gadsby-body-of-work-a-joyful-guide-to-blasting-netflix-and-messing-with-christian-bakers
