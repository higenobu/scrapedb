1/5/2022,"Steven Toast is the Fellini of failure. He’s an actor who can empty a theatre faster than a teargas canister. He’s a more disastrous on-set presence than an Omicron outbreak. And – after six years – he brazenly swaggers back on to our screens this week, proving that it isn’t just a good man you can’t keep down. BBC Two’s Toast of Tinseltown is an incredibly welcome return for one of the best comic creations of the last 10 years. Toast (Matt Berry) has relocated to Hollywood, following three series of Toast of London – which saw him tailspinning through demeaning bit parts, mortifying scandals and doomed auditions since its launch in 2013. Now, Toast believes he will finally get his due, and the great wrong of his omission from the acting pantheon will be righted.  There is one tiny problem, though: the acting pantheon doesn’t want him. He doesn’t even make it to the opening credits of Toast of Tinseltown’s first episode before a furious Larry David is yelling: “Are you serious? Is this guy a real actor?” To see Toast in action is to be treated to the enthralling spectacle of a man who unshakeably believes that he is one of the finest thespians of his generation, despite being the recipient of worst actor awards. For the whole of the first series, rotten-veg-hurling protesters greet him upon his entrance to the stage door of the production he’s appearing in – dubbed London’s worst play. He gets the kind of radioactive reviews that have sunk the careers of better men, has been cancelled by the literal PC police and was once buried alive by a maverick director. Toast wants to be the Milk Tray man, but ends up as Basildon Bond. He’s the ultimate fish out of water, an analogue actor in the digital age. Even his rivalries are the stuff of Greek myth – eternal conflicts played out by idiots. As the screen and stage work dries up, he is reduced to cornball voiceovers where he is tormented by the millennial inanities of hipster sound guys Danny Bear (Tim Downie) and Clem Fandango (Shazad Latif). Toast facing down these Urban Outfitters rejects who have him read out obscene hearing aid adverts, honking horns and whinnying like a horse offers a joy seldom seen on TV. You watch as the generation gap becomes a chasm. But the real joy is his ultimate rivalry with Ray Purchase (Harry Peacock)– a taller, leaner, more handsome Toast, who looks like a Reader’s Digest knitwear model. In the first episode of Toast of Tinseltown, the ludicrously OTT competition for a movie role and the affections of Mrs Purchase (Tracy-Ann Oberman) has Toast karate-chopping desks in half, with Purchase’s moustache writhing so furiously it’s in danger of leaping clear off his face. The raw physical presence of Peacock’s scenery-chewing Purchase bumping up against Toast’s unbridled contempt and hauteur make it an unmissable watch. Berry’s role as Toast is responsible for the best performances of his career. Some say that Matt Berry always plays Matt Berry and, admittedly, if you’re looking for the range of Daniel Day-Lewis, you will be disappointed. But this is to miss the point – Berry’s work is best seen as a single piece of performance art, a career-long excavation of a very specific kind of near-extinct masculinity – all Old Spice, coiffured hair and hammy glares. So of course there are deep echoes of previous characters: Doctor Sanchez in Darkplace, Douglas Reynholm in The IT Crowd, his perma-foiled suitor from Snuff Box. Toast, though, is the apex predator of Matt Berry characters. The rest are merely pale imitations. This is especially true given what a showcase Toast is for Berry’s unique musical output. Many episodes feature absurdist musical numbers that see him do things like duet with a moustachioed child version of himself about the shame of visiting a sex worker. Then there’s the surprisingly catchy masonic ritual ditty On the Square. Given the influence of co-writer/creator Arthur Mathews, there are characters and scenes that wouldn’t be out of place in Father Ted – although the prospect of a Ted/Toast cinematic universe seems likely to remain a pipe dream. Dreams are sometimes all we have, though, and the saga of Steven Toast is all about one man’s dream to achieve the recognition he manifestly does not deserve. That thick-eared tenacity is the main thing that makes him relatable. If you’ve ever felt out of your depth at work, bewildered by some aspect of youth culture or unjustly overlooked then all of a sudden, he starts to make sense. He’ll never quit. Deny it all you like, but there’s a bit of Toast in all of us.",Arts/Television & radio,‘One of the best comic creations of the last 10 years’: Matt Berry is back as Steven Toast,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/05/one-of-the-best-comic-creations-of-the-last-10-years-matt-berry-is-back-as-steven-toast
1/5/2022,"Norman Mailer’s son has denied reports that the late writer has been “cancelled” over his controversialist views. Earlier this week, the journalist Michael Wolff, author of the Trump White House exposé Fire and Fury, claimed in an article for The Ankler that a planned collection of Mailer’s political writings to mark the centennial of his birth next year had been cancelled by Random House. According to Wolff, one of the reasons for the cancellation was “a junior staffer’s objection to the title of Mailer’s 1957 essay, The White Negro”.  But the New York Times has now reported that the collection, including unpublished writings, has been acquired by Skyhorse, the independent press which also picked up Woody Allen’s memoir after it was dropped by Hachette, and Blake Bailey’s biography of Philip Roth after it was dropped by WW Norton. John Buffalo Mailer, told the paper that his father’s longtime publisher Random House had declined to make an offer for the book. While he said that “we would have liked to have done this book with them”, he speculated that the publisher turned it down “because this is the first commercial book of Norman’s that’s going to come out in the era we’re living in, and there’s going to be a lot of questions”. “They didn’t feel they were the right house to do this book right now,” he told the New York Times. “I don’t think they have any interest in trying to cancel Norman Mailer. You can’t cancel Norman Mailer.” Random House said in a statement that it was “factually incorrect that Random House cancelled an upcoming book of essays by Norman Mailer” and that the book was never under contract. Literary agent Andrew Wylie, representing the Mailer estate, told the New York Times that “Random House is proud to publish Norman Mailer, and intends to promote his work significantly for the centennial, in tandem with the publication by Skyhorse of the anthology”. Mailer died aged 84 in 2007. He was the recipient of two Pulitzer prizes, for his 1968 account of a peace march on the Pentagon, The Armies of the Night, and for his 1979 work The Executioner’s Song, about the life and death of a criminal, Gary Gilmore. Controversial and pugnacious, he was also known for stabbing his second wife Adele Morales with a penknife, puncturing her cardiac sac.",Arts/Books,"Norman Mailer has not been ‘cancelled’, his son insists",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/05/norman-mailer-has-not-been-cancelled-his-son-insists-random-house-essays
1/5/2022,"When I was 21, a man considered to be an authority on literature suggested I not become a writer. It was a few days before I graduated from college with a degree in creative writing. The National Book award-winning writer who had taught our senior fiction seminar told me, quite gently, to give up on my dreams. I can picture so clearly that room where we sat together, him behind a desk, sunlight streaming in from the windows behind him. He was not happy to see me when I walked in the door. I was young and punk and weird and had big hair. He was 55, bearded, grey and bespectacled.  All semester, he had barely critiqued my stories, remaining quiet in class as my peers rattled off suggestions and ideas. He returned printouts of my work with just a few scribbles added. And now here I was visiting him in his office, ready for the moment where he would tell me where I could improve, what paths he thought I should take. He asked me what I wanted to do after graduation, and I told him I wanted to write. He said: “You know, honey, not everyone makes it as a writer.” I walked out of his office, dazed and discouraged. I suppose I had wanted him to say: “You’re a genius. Let me make a few calls and get you an agent. Or a job that will set you on your way.” Perhaps he thought I didn’t have talent. Or, perhaps he saw me as frivolous. I was writing stories about sex and relationships and so-called domestic matters. I remember I wrote an entire short story about a woman waiting to get her period. He wrote big, sprawling novels that were about soldiers and war and violence. Maybe he didn’t enjoy teaching; he had never seemed excited to be there. To discourage someone from even trying, though? To say “give up” before I’d even gotten started? Writing is holy, as my friend Patricia Lockwood says. It is true that it is hard to make it as a writer, or any kind of artist, for that matter. But if you love to write, you should write forever. For years I have used this story as inspiration. He told me I couldn’t, and yet somehow I did anyway. He was an older man, negative and condescending. I’ll show him, I thought. But it is only recently that I realised that moment was actually radically freeing. I was probably not suited to be a writer in the way he thought was important. But that did not mean I was not suited to be a writer. In a way, he gave me a fresh start, a new year. The first of January of the rest of my life. In fact, he was telling me the truth as he knew it. The career path of a fiction writer in 1993 was defined but also limited. Achieving a master of fine arts degree, perhaps adjunct teaching, submitting to literary journals, the New Yorker, Granta,the Paris Review, every little journal across America, applying for grants and residencies, maybe working toward tenure. A lot of it sounded like the kind of work that I wouldn’t be any good at. But that was what was available at the time. There were no obvious workarounds coming out of the academic world. What I took away from him was that I would have to carve my own path. No problem, easy-peasy. I only had to fail a hundred times to get there, get terrible reviews until I got good reviews, go broke once or twice (OK thrice), toss out any idea of achieving conventional life goals, and essentially edit my very existence in service of being a writer. But I was that, after all, even if it took more than a decade to arrive there. I took dozens of jobs I could quit easily – and often did. I waited tables, tended bars and temped in a blur of offices across the US. I made so many mistakes, but I was always keeping my eye on the prize: the time to read and write and think. No matter what, I always found my way back to writing. That’s the part that kept me sane all along. Not selling a book or publishing a book but making the book in the first place. Finally, I landed in New York City. I worked in advertising, writing bits of terrible copy to keep the lights on. I went to readings and studied other writers. I started to give readings myself. I made a few zines. The whole time I wasn’t thinking about literary credibility. I just wanted to write because it was the thing I loved best. I was building this creative life without consciously knowing it. I found my way to the internet in the late 90s. I started as someone with a blog. It wasn’t the way you were supposed to do it at the time, but it was the way that made the most sense to me. There was no splashy short story debut in the New Yorker. But I attracted a readership, and worked my way into writing essays, more zines and then a short book with a small press, and then very blindly and naively writing a linked story collection, my first with a big press, 13 years after I had graduated from college. Things have gotten a little easier as time has gone on, but still I never relax. There is no coasting in a creative life; we are constantly adjusting, altering, tending our paths. And there’s a lot of insecurity: about money, your identity, your place in the world, your reviews, your relevance. A few things have helped me along the way: ideas or actions to continue stimulating my growth as a person and an artist. Travelling is one. I’ve driven across country, caught trains to different cities and ridden my bike all over New York City in search of a new cafe or a sculpture garden I hadn’t seen before. Even just walking everywhere I can has been helpful, eyes up, paying attention, watching, listening. And I have read constantly, outside my genre as well as within it. Reading is the surest path to understanding. It leads to a fullness within us. I focused on friendships, too, becoming part of a cohort I didn’t necessarily know I was developing – I have always just been so excited to meet other writers. I went to readings and drinks after literary conferences, sent emails and liked tweets because I wanted to. The extra gift is that these people end up being your best cheerleaders and critics alike. I found the ones who would tell me the truth, and who wanted me to succeed – and I have tried to be that person for them, as well. I looked for role models, too, when I was starting out. I looked up to the writers who led the way by being inventive in form or genre, or giving voice to characters of all kinds, or who smashed through glass ceilings or knocked down gates. I paid attention to them and was inspired by them. I could never have planned for it to work out the way it did. I have written eight books and will probably write at least a few more. I live a quiet life with my dog in a small house with a nice back yard where I have finally stopped killing everything I plant. I treasure my friendships and the endless pile of notebooks I keep filling, marvelling occasionally at how there are always, somehow, more words in the world. There is always a fresh start when I open a new notebook. It is always 1 January when I turn to the first page. I recently turned 50, nearly 30 years since that (now deceased) old teacher of mine told me I probably shouldn’t bother. I’m old enough to realise that there is one more important part to carving out your creative life: honouring your successes no matter the size. And honouring the bad moments too. Laying your burdens down. Building this writing life has always been about recognising what was holding me back so I could move on. One writer told me no. I honour his rejection. He said no, but I said yes.  I Came All This Way to Meet You by Jami Attenberg is published by Profile Books (£14.99). To order a copy for £13.04, go to guardianbookshop.com.

1/5/2022,"Jamila Wignot’s documentary is a tribute to the work of the African American dancer and choreographer Alvin Ailey, a man who grew up in Texas during the Great Depression and Jim Crow years – and embraced his destiny in dance in California, where his mother had taken him as a child while she was looking for work. This film focuses a good deal on Ailey’s most renowned and arguably greatest creation, Revelations (1960), a dance piece inspired by the church and spirituals which had a transcendent passion, a surmounting of the rage and pain of slavery. The generosity and urgency in this work allowed Ailey’s vision to cross boundaries, using dancers’ bodies almost as a kind of folk history of black American experience.  There are some absorbing testimonies from the dancers who worked with him, particularly about the ecstatic ovations his company would get on tour. About a Frankfurt show, one says wonderingly: “I’ve never seen people take their shoes off and hit the wall like that!” Ailey’s own private life as a gay man was opaque, because he was not someone given to joining political movements. The nearest this film comes to criticising him is when his younger dance contemporary, Bill T Jones, says that, despite the Aids crisis, Ailey did not speak out and his sexual identity was covered up “and he participated in the cover-up”. What emerges very touchingly here is Ailey’s relationship with his mother, whom he described as “extraordinarily beautiful, like Lena Horne”. This was the woman who moved in with him in his last illness, elderly as she was, to nurse him. What emerges is Ailey’s lifelong seriousness and his vocational purpose in dance.  Ailey is released on 7 January in cinemas.",Arts/Film,Ailey review – touching tribute to icon whose dance crossed boundaries,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/05/ailey-review-touching-tribute-to-icon-whose-dance-crossed-boundaries
1/5/2022,"Spicy and ear-tinglingly sour, this classic Thai soup is just what I fancy at this time of year: it’s something to cut through the pleasant, festive fug and reset the senses. Though shellfish are a common ingredient, this soup is almost endlessly adaptable, even for vegans: as long as it vibrates with flavour – aromatic lime leaves and lemongrass, warming galangal and fresh citrus – you’re on the right track. Prep 12 minCook 15 minServes 4  16 raw shell-on king prawns1 dash vegetable oil4 fresh makrut lime leaves2 lemongrass stalks2 thick slices galangal2 bird’s eyes chillies1 tbsp palm sugar, or soft brown sugarJuice of 1½ limes2 tbsp fish sauce1 handful coriander or Thai basil leaves, to serve You’ll need raw, shell-on prawns here. Frozen are fine, so long as they’re defrosted and soft enough to shell, but if your prawns are very large (or very small), adjust the quantities accordingly. If you can find only shelled prawns, use a litre of light fish or chicken stock (or even just water), and start from step 3. Shell the prawns, retaining the shells and heads, and set aside the meat for the time being. Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium-high flame, then fry the shells and heads, stirring regularly, until they turn a vivid pink. Add a litre of water, bring up to a lively simmer, then strain into a clean pan and discard the spent shells. Roughly tear the lime leaves (avoid using the dried kind here: frozen are fine, though, but fresh are infinitely preferable and fairly widely available). Bruise the lemongrass by pressing down on it with the flat of a large knife, then cut it into roughly 5cm lengths. Cut two thick slices of galangal – this ginger-like root is sold in specialist south-east Asian food stores and some large supermarkets, but use ginger if you can’t source any. Add the lime leaves, lemongrass and galangal to the stock pan, bring it back up to a simmer, then leave to bubble gently and infuse for five minutes. Meanwhile, finely slice the chillies, leaving the pith and seeds inside (depending on your taste for spice, add more, if you like). Slide the chillies into the broth and leave the stock to blip away for a couple of minutes longer. Turn down the heat to the barest simmer, add the prawn meat to the broth and cook for about a minute, until just pink (be careful not to let the stock boil or to cook the prawns for too long, or they will turn rubbery). Take off the hob, stir in the sugar, lime juice and fish sauce, then taste and adjust the seasoning as necessary. Ladle the soup into bowls, making sure the prawns are evenly divided, then tear in the fresh herbs in generous quantities and serve immediately. It’s not traditional, but you can bulk out the soup by adding some cooked rice noodles if you want to make it a more substantial dish, or add other vegetables such as chopped tomatoes, mushrooms or whatever else takes your fancy. If you’re not a shellfish fan, make this with good chicken stock, and add torn cooked chicken (or pork or turkey) at the end, just to warm it through. There’s also a more modern, richer variation of tom yum in which coconut or evaporated milk is added at the end of cooking: if that appeals, make only 750ml stock, and stir in 300ml coconut milk with the seasonings just before serving. To make this vegan, use vegetable stock or water, and add two round shallots, peeled and cut into wedges, along with the aromatics in step 3. Add two deseeded and roughly chopped tomatoes and 200g chopped oyster, shiitake and/or chestnut mushrooms with the chillies. Vegan versions of fish sauce are available, and I’d recommend getting hold of some for this dish. Vegan or not, you can also add some firm diced tofu instead of the prawns; I think it’s also rather nice with those fried tofu puffs sold in specialist south-east Asian food shops. Pick up a jar of nam prik pao while you’re there: this rich, sweet chilli paste, also available in vegetarian form, is a great addition to tom yum, and a great many other dishes besides.

1/5/2022,"Preet Chandi, thought to be the first woman of colour to complete a solo crossing on Antarctica, has finished her expedition to the south pole almost a week ahead of schedule. Chandi or “Polar Preet”, endured temperatures of -50C as she skied 700 miles across Antarctica in 40 days, seven hours and three minutes, narrowly missing out on setting a new world record by a woman for the trek.  She finished just behind the time set by Johanna Davidsson of Sweden, who finished in 38 days, 23 hours and five minutes in 2016. Chandi, 32, is now the third-fastest female solo skier for the expedition behind Davidsson and Britain’s Hannah McKeand, who recorded a time of 39 days, nine hours and 33 minutes in 2006. She is also the first person to reach the south pole on foot in two years. Chandi, a British Army physiotherapist who lives in Derby, said it was surreal to reach her goal: “I made it to the south pole where it’s snowing. I’m feeling so many emotions right now. I knew nothing about the polar world three years ago and it feels so surreal to finally be here. It was tough getting here and I want to thank everybody for their support. “This expedition was always about so much more than me. I want to encourage people to push their boundaries and to believe in themselves, and I want you to be able to do it without being labelled a rebel. “No matter where you are from or where your start line is, everybody starts somewhere.” As well as freezing temperatures, Chandi endured wind speeds of up to 60mph and battled whiteouts while pulling a 90kg sled across sastrugi, parallel wave-like ridges on the hard snow caused by winds. She also suffered from exhaustion towards the end of the journey, as well as a persistent cough and sickness. Setting off on 24 November from Hercules Inlet, Chandi aimed to complete her trek in 45 days, carrying enough rations for 48 days. In the end she finished five days ahead of schedule, covering a daily average distance of about 17 miles. She spent years training for the trek, having previously completed a 27-day expedition on the ice cap in Greenland and taking part in ultramarathons, including the gruelling Marathon des Sables across the Sahara. Chandi said she hoped her journey would inspire young people, women and those from minority-ethnic backgrounds. Speaking to the Guardian during her training for the trek, she said people did not expect an Asian woman to attempt such an endeavour. “I am an Asian woman; I’m not the image that people expect to see out there,” she said. “People say the outdoors is for everyone and yes, it is. But if you come from a community that is not involved in it at all, or you don’t see anybody that looks like you doing it, it can be really hard.” After completing the trek, she plans to set up an adventure grant to help more women fund expeditions in what is often a male-dominated arena. “I have been told ‘no’ on many occasions and to ‘just do the normal thing’, but we create our own normal,” she said. “You are capable of anything you want.”",News/World news,Preet Chandi becomes first woman of colour to ski solo to south pole,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/preet-chandi-becomes-first-woman-of-colour-to-ski-solo-to-south-pole

1/5/2022,"It’s safe to say that it’s not a happy new year for Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos and – following a guilty verdict on four of 11 charges in a California court this week – a convicted fraudster. Holmes, you may remember, promised her devices could diagnose a plethora of health problems from a pinprick of your blood, gaining coverage from the media throughout the 2010s. We now know the technology Holmes hawked to investors, the media and the general public was seriously flawed.  Theranos was founded in 2003 and collapsed in 2018, following a Wall Street Journal report by John Carreyrou that highlighted issues with the company’s test results. In court, Holmes was acquitted on three charges connected to patients who received erroneous test results, but as the Guardian’s Kari Paul writes, the case “marks a milestone for Silicon Valley – an industry that has for years evaded accountability in its pervasive culture of ‘fake it till you make it’ that encourages founders to make big promises, often with little proof.” British entrepreneur and investor Vikas Shah describes Theranos as “a very expensive canary in a coalmine. For the last decade, we’ve seen investors pile money into [unproven] business time and time again.” Such investment begets a vicious circle, in which the press and public play their own roles. Big money raises for hot new companies are fundamentally more interesting to journalists than dull business developments. We cover them enthusiastically (Forbes called Holmes the “next Steve Jobs”), which allows those companies in turn to raise more cash. Some companies even get to the point of publicly listing with great fanfare, then flopping as the share price sinks – often on the day they launch. It’s a pattern that’s happened too many times to mention, yet we still fall for it. I’m also minded to think of Holmes’ business, and others like it, in light of the manifesto of a relaunched WIRED magazine, published this week by recently arrived editor Gideon Lichfield. WIRED, of course, was a techno-utopian booster when launched in 1993. It heralded tech’s excellence, and captured the spirit of its time: a Jetsons-like promise for the future of the world, carried on tech’s broad back. Since then, we’ve all gone through the looking-glass. I often say I’m a tech-sceptic tech reporter, because like many I’ve been jaded by successive scandals and endless “jam tomorrow” promises of the likes of Theranos. More generally, many of us have become ground down by tech’s promise to radically rewrite our future, only to find that it’s little more than a rebranding of the past imbalances, designed to supplant one controlling power with another. The liberation of the media from a small cabal of editors resulted in the torrent of fake news and the polarisation of our planet on the likes of Facebook. What was meant to be a decapitation of the old leaders and a replacement with a flatter hierarchy actually just entrenched the power of the old guard, and made social media companies more powerful. The promise of removing the gatekeepers in the old world of entertainment has done that to a certain extent, but has ended up making Alphabet, parent company of YouTube and one of the world’s richest firms, even richer – all while a phalanx of creators produce content for free. Even within the creator economy, the idea of a democratising force didn’t end up that way. 96.5% of YouTubers don’t make enough to break the US poverty line, according to one analysis, while TikTok disburses only around five per cent of its revenue to the people who produce its content. All of which is to say: don’t believe the hype. Tech companies overpromise and underdeliver. They’ve spent decades doing it. They’re continuing to do it. Yet Lichfield’s essay is an interesting one, because it discourages us from thinking simply of things as wholly positive or wholly negative. After years of yo-yoing from tech idealism to tech scepticism, we shouldn’t immediately discount the promise technology has to reinvent our lives. “We’re at what feels like an inflection point in the recent history of technology, when various binaries that have long been taken for granted are being called into question,” he writes. It’s worth looking at the Theranos story through that lens. Yes, the company appears to have exaggerated or invented many of its claims. But there are a range of tech-first companies actually doing miraculous things in the field of medicine and diagnostics. The fact we’re able to shoulder the burden of the omicron variant of coronavirus is largely down to the likes of techno-utopian companies BioNTech basically inventing new techniques to manufacture vaccines at a scale never before seen. Tech overpromises, and tech coverage often too readily repeats unlikely claims. But technology is still significant. For every tech bro trying to rebrand PDFs as “literature NFTs” (which has more than a hint of Uber rebranding the bus), there are people who are doing legitimately exciting things. “The exciting part is we are genuinely at a time when technology is doing incredible things,” says Shah. “It’s not about being anti-utopian, but it’s about asking sensible questions. Is something fair and reasonable?” Healthy scepticism is no bad thing, then. It’s what keeps the vast majority of society from buying into the so-far illusory promise of Web3, another gleaming vision of the tech-enabled future that promises to decentralise control, but so far as resulted in a handful of people getting filthy rich by selling cartoonish JPGs. It’s what protects you from the endless number of scams and thefts that are dominating the world of NFTs at present. For years we have too readily accepted what tech founders and leaders tell us without thinking: “Is this really realistic?” Now, we’re running the risk of slipping too far in the opposite direction. The new challenge is striking the balance between the two.

1/5/2022,"Labour has accused the Ministry of Defence of wasting £13bn of taxpayers’ money since the Conservatives came to power on failed procurement projects, overspends and other administrative errors. The opposition published a 16-page dossier, which it said highlighted a string of examples of financial mismanagement, including £4bn of waste since 2019, the year the current defence secretary, Ben Wallace, was appointed.  John Healey, the shadow defence secretary, accused ministers of having “no grip on the MoD’s finances” and said the scale of waste was “significant and systemic”. None of its 36 projects were rated green – “on time and in budget” – according to official Whitehall assessments, he added. The overspends were taken from MoD and other official documents, and some date back to flawed procurement decisions during Labour’s 13 years in government, which ended in 2010. Recent problems highlighted include: A £1bn overspend relating to the building of a new nuclear warhead manufacturing site at the state-owned Atomic Weapons Establishment in Burghfield near Reading. The National Audit Office, the government watchdog, warned in a 2020 report that the project was delayed by more than six years due to poor project management. Delays in the procurement of three additional Astute class nuclear-powered attack submarines, costing just over £1bn, which are intended to take the total fleet to seven by 2026. A cost of £595m incurred for no military benefit when the planned upgrade to the Warrior armoured vehicle, which was started in 2011, was scrapped in last spring’s defence review. By that stage, the programme, described as an “abject failure” by the Commons defence committee, was running seven years late. The MoD has faced repeated criticisms of its management of large contracts. MPs on the cross party public accounts committee said in November that the system of defence procurement was “broken” and they feared that overspends would eat up the £16.5bn extra in government money allocated last year. Current concerns centre on the introduction of the £5.5bn Ajax heavy armoured vehicle, which has been plagued by serious noise and vibration problems that its manufacturers are struggling to fix. Soldiers were put at risk of harm in testing, the defence procurement minister Jeremy Quin admitted last month. But problems with financial management at the MoD date back many years, including to Labour’s time in government. Delays and overspends during Labour’s time in office plagued the development of RAF Nimrod spy planes, cancelled by the Conservatives shortly after taking office in 2010. Waste on the programme is included in Labour’s dossier at a cost of £3.7bn, the largest single item identified. Also highlighted are £2.8bn of overspends relating to the development of the Queen Elizabeth and Prince of Wales aircraft carriers. The cost of building the Royal Navy’s biggest ever ships soared from an initial estimate of £3.9bn – when the project was commissioned under Labour in 2007 – to £6.4bn. Labour said it would commission the NAO to conduct an across-the-board audit of MoD waste, and make the department subject to a spending regime enforced by a newly created Office for Value for Money. “Reforming the department will not be easy, but this report takes a crucial first step,” Healey added. In response, the Ministry of Defence said it was “serious about investing in Defence modernisation” and said it was prepared to take “tough decisions to replace old equipment and halt programmes that no longer fit requirements” even if it meant writing off spending.",News/Politics,"MoD has wasted £13bn since Tories came to power, Labour claims",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/05/mod-has-wasted-13bn-since-tories-came-to-power-labour-claims
