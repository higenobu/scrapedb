5/13/2022,"Graham pushed Sanders to hold a vote on his signature Medicare for All proposal. He said Democrats ""would rather jump out the window"" instead of vote on it. Sanders is a leading Medicare for All advocate, but it has no path to becoming law soon. Color Sen. Lindsay Graham skeptical when it comes to whether Democrats will ever sign onto Medicare for All. On Thursday, Sen. Bernie Sanders held a Senate Budget Committee hearing about Medicare for All, giving an impassioned speech on one of his signature issues. ""I'm hoping that after this speech that you will be putting your idea up for a vote,"" Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said Thursday at the Senate Budget Committee hearing. ""And if not, why not? Because most of your colleagues would rather jump out the window if they had to vote on this."" In prepared remarks, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont said millions of Americans understand that the current healthcare system is ""dysfunctional, extraordinarily wasteful and expensive, and cruel."" ""Families should not be driven into financial ruin because someone became seriously ill,"" Sanders said. ""How insane is that?"" Graham's bet is the proposal would split Democrats if they ever voted on it, which is unlikely. Sanders is among the measure's most ardent supporters in Congress. It would overhaul the nation's health insurance system, eliminating the private insurance sector and placing every American onto a single federal insurer. ""Maybe, just maybe, Congress should represent the American people, and not lobbyists and large corporations,"" Sanders said in his opening remarks. ""Guaranteeing healthcare as a right is important to the American people, not just from a moral and financial perspective — it also happens to be what the majority of the American people want,"" he added. The plan is popular among liberal Democrats but has no path to becoming law in the near future. President Joe Biden was opposed to the single-payer plan during the 2020 Democratic primary, and instead indicated support for a public option that would offer Americans government-backed health insurance if they pursued it. Many Americans would like to see a host of different types of medical care covered under a public option. Top economists have said that the program would cost less than the current system, and ultimately help Americans save more — while saving lives. ""Mr. Chairman, this is a debate worth having. I applaud your passion. I don't agree with your idea,"" Graham said. ""But here's what I would suggest to you and others who believe in this idea: Let's vote on it.""

5/13/2022,"At first glance, it looks as if a doorway has been carefully carved into a rock face on Mars. The grainy image, taken by the mast-mounted camera on Nasa’s Curiosity rover on May 7 this year, appears to show an opening with an arched lintel leading to a passageway with smooth walls. Conspiracy theorists have seized upon the snap as evidence for life on the Red Planet, but scientists were quick to point out that the surrounding geology gives a clear picture of how the formation arose - and unsurprisingly it does not require Martian architects. A large fissure to the left of the doorway demonstrates rock-cracking events frequently occur in the region, while a boulder in the foreground appears to have fallen from the opening. Sanjeev Gupta, a professor of earth science at Imperial College London, one of the scientists of Nasa's Curiosity rover mission, said the hole was formed through “normal geological processes”. “The boulder likely just got eroded off a hillslope and tumbled down,” he said. “It does not require a meteorite strike. “The crack is a fracture and they are abundant on Mars and Earth - no need for marsquakes to produce them. “There is nothing at all strange in the image - these are just normal geological processes.” It is not the first time that images from Mars have sparked theories that civilisations may have inhabited the planet. In 1977, Nasa’s Viking 1 spacecraft photographed what appeared to be a face, staring up from the surface, leading to claims that Martians may have constructed monuments like the Sphinx. When Nasa’s Mars Global Surveyor flew over the area 11 years later, snapping images 10 times sharper than the original Viking shots, the “face” was found to be a shapeless rock formation. The original facial features had been caused by shadows. In May 2015, Curiosity photographed a pyramid about the size of a small car, which some people speculated may be the capstone of a larger, buried megalith. But at the time, Nasa pointed out that the rock was similar to angular volcanic rocks found in Hawaii or Iceland. Humans brains are programmed to find significance in random images, a psychological phenomenon known as pareidolia. Facial pareidolia, which is particularly strong, would have helped our ancestors to spot predators in dense undergrowth or in the dark. It is likely to be the reason why people believed they had spotted a yeti on Mars Gusev crater, in pictures taken by Nasa’s Spirit rover in 2008. A rock which resembled an iguana was also spotted in 2013. Scientists believe that life may once have existed on Mars, but would struggle today due to the lack of atmosphere. Nasa and the European Space Agency (ESA) have plans to drill down into the surface in the hope of finding fossilised remains of alien lifeforms.",Science/The Telegraph,‘Doorway’ on Mars leads to fresh conspiracy theories - but scientists quickly shut it,https://news.yahoo.com/doorway-mars-leads-fresh-conspiracy-170936607.html
5/13/2022,"A Georgia death row inmate set to be executed for the 1976 murder of an 8-year-old girl and rape of a 10-year-old girl has made his last meal request, according to the Georgia Department of Corrections Virgil Delano Presnell, Jr. is scheduled to be executed on May 17 at 7 p.m. Presnell, 68, was accused of abducting and attacking the two girls as they walked home from school in Cobb County, just outside Atlanta, on May 4, 1976. Presnell asked for four hamburgers, four French fries, two vanilla milkshakes, four sodas, and 8-piece bucket of chicken, potato salad and two pints of vanilla ice cream as his last meal. [DOWNLOAD: Free WSB-TV News app for alerts as news breaks] Death row inmates are typically allowed to ask for a last meal before being executed. Presnell would be the first person executed by the state of Georgia since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. The last person executed by Georgia was Donnie Cleveland Lance in January 2020. Georgia uses an injection of the sedative pentobarbital to carry out executions. Virgil was convicted in August 1976 on charges including malice murder, kidnapping and rape and was sentenced to death. His death sentence was overturned in 1992 but was reinstated in March 1999.

He returned the next day, and abducted the girl and her 8-year-old friend, Lori Ann Smith, when they came walking down the trail, according to evidence at trial outlined in a Georgia Supreme Court ruling. He drove the two girls to a secluded wooded area, made them undress and raped the older girl, the ruling says. The younger girl tried to run as he took her back to the car, but Presnell caught her, shoved her face underwater in a creek and drowned her. Presnell then locked the older girl in his car trunk, began driving and dropped her in a wooded area when he got a flat tire. Throughout, Presnell had forced her to engage in sex acts multiple times, the ruling says. Presnell had told the girl he’d return, but she heard sounds from a nearby gas station and walked there. She described Presnell and his car with a flat tire to police, who found him changing his tire at his apartment complex near where he’d left the older girl. [SIGN UP: WSB-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter] At first, Presnell denied everything but later he led police to the 8-year-old girl’s body and confessed, the ruling says. Police found a handgun and child pornography showing young girls in his bedroom. Attorneys for Presnell have said in court filings that Presnell was born to a teenage mother who drank and smoked heavily throughout her pregnancy. Presnell suffered from fetal alcohol syndrome that damaged his brain and kept him “from ever developing into a functioning, responsible adult,” his lawyers argued. “Coupled with a childhood marked by ongoing violence, alcoholism, and sexual and physical abuse, it is not at all difficult to see how he developed into an adult with serious disturbances which, left unchecked and untreated, could produce tragic results,” his lawyers wrote in a filing arguing that his sentence was unconstitutional. His attorneys have filed an emergency motion to postpone Presnell’s execution.",U.S./WSB Cox articles,Georgia death row inmate requests last meal before planned execution next week,https://news.yahoo.com/georgia-death-row-inmate-requests-173716696.html
