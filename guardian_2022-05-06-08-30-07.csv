5/6/2022,"For the second week in a row, Liverpool can get their work done before sitting back to see how Manchester City fare. The extent of any European bounce or, in City’s case, hangover may be hard to predict but Jürgen Klopp’s men have certainly built up fearsome head of steam to carry into the final four games. Like Liverpool, Spurs have a rival sitting just above them who, by and large, keep on winning: falling five points behind Arsenal this weekend could prove very costly going into Thursday’s north London derby and it adds to the sense that neither team can really afford anything but victory at Anfield. Spurs were not especially convincing in beating Leicester but, with an on-song Harry Kane and Son Heung-min kept fresh for the best part of a week, might fancy exposing any tired legs from that monumental comeback at Villarreal. Seasons are on the line for both sides, who would doubtless have preferred different opponents at this point. NA Liverpool v Tottenham, Saturday 7.45pm (all times BST) Even before their midweek Champions League defeat at the Bernabéu, Manchester City’s home match against resurgent Newcastle looked one of the more likely banana skins on their top-flight run-in. Until, that is, you examined Eddie Howe’s record against Pep Guardiola – a miserable 11 defeats from 11 with an aggregate score of 34-5. All but one of those losses occurred before Wor Eddie joined Pep in the managerial ranks of the nation state-owned sportswashing vehicles, only to lose his first El Gasico derby 4-0 at St James’ Park in December. His much-improved side travel to the Etihad Stadium to take on a team that were left floored and visibly distraught by their mugging by Real Madrid. It is up to Guardiola to rally his troops, a task that may take some doing. After City’s failure in a massive midweek test of their mettle, a season that promised so much could be completely derailed by Sunday evening. BG Manchester City v Newcastle, Sunday 4.30pm Manchester United’s penultimate match of a season when their remaining objective is a place in 2022-23’s Europa League. A win against an in-form Brighton will get them there but this wasn’t how it was supposed to be when Cristiano Ronaldo returned to the club last summer, as more optimistic fans dreamed Ole Gunnar Solskjær might be capable of restoring the glory days to Old Trafford. Ralf Rangnick was later brought in to change the club’s culture but will depart to coach Austria and make periodical returns for his consultancy role as the outsider he has always been. What legacy will the caretaker leave? Giving debuts to Álvaro Fernández, the 19-year-old Spaniard, to follow the few minutes granted to Alejandro Garnacho against Brentford on Monday is about all there is left. United fans have spent much of the season as onlookers hoping Liverpool and Manchester City can slip up in some fashion. JB Brighton v Manchester United, Saturday 5.30pm The release of Burnley’s accounts on Wednesday revealed exactly how financially ruinous relegation could be for a club that were sitting on extremely healthy cash reserves before their leveraged buyout by ALK Capital in December 2020. In a nutshell, if Burnley go down they will not be financially well-placed to yo-yo straight back up and their situation could get an awful lot worse before it gets better. On the plus side the interim manager, Mike Jackson, has enjoyed a dream start after taking 10 points from his four games in charge, masterminding a team that have shown no shortage of character since the departure of Sean Dyche. Aston Villa travel to Turf Moor on Saturday for another game Burnley will view as eminently winnable against struggling opponents who have taken our points from the past 18 available. While the avoidance of relegation would constitute quite the heroic Houdini act for Burnley and their blameless fans, it remains to be seen if their owners deserve any such reprieve. BG Burnley v Aston Villa, Saturday 3pm Encounters with Crystal Palace can stir bitter memories for Watford fans – 2013’s playoff final or the FA Cup semi-final of 2016, for example (even if that was avenged in the 2019 quarter-finals) – and the chances are that Saturday will bring another. Watford’s visit to Selhurst is likely to end in the confirmation of relegation and an unhappy return for Roy Hodgson to a former club where he is regarded fondly. Watford’s outgoing manager says this will be his last Premier League job and he will expect his side to at least go down fighting. They are doomed if they don’t win so will have to begin with the same intensity they initially demonstrated against Burnley last week before folding at the last. The trouble is that is likely to expose their defence to an attack that picked them apart in a 4-1 win at Vicarage Road in February. Wilfried Zaha, Jean-Philippe Mateta, Connor Gallagher and co have the form and potency to capitalise. TD Crystal Palace v Watford, Saturday 3pm Opportunity knocks for Arsenal on Sunday and it will be positively thrashing at the door if they face Leeds in the knowledge Spurs have failed to win at Liverpool. A fourth straight win could give them a foot in the Champions League; their previous three have not been particularly smooth going but squad players have stepped up and served them admirably. Chief among them has been Eddie Nketiah, who put in his best all-round performance for Arsenal in the victory at West Ham even if he did not score. Nketiah’s contribution outside the six-yard box has long raised question marks about him but he stretched the Hammers with intelligent runs, pressed ferociously and held the ball up well. Whether it is enough to keep him at the Emirates beyond this season remains to be seen but Nketiah has a crucial role to play over the coming fortnight, particularly as Alexandre Lacazette has looked so lacklustre in recent weeks. Against his relegation-haunted former loan club, Leeds, he should receive another chance to be a hero. NA Arsenal v Leeds, Sunday 2pm Short of marching out at Molineux to face Brighton last Saturday wielding buckets and spades while wearing handkerchiefs knotted at each corner on their heads the players of Wolves could scarcely have looked more “on the beach” and were duly walloped, leaving their manager, Bruno Lage, understandably furious. He said after the game that many of his charges are playing for their futures and even several of them may not be overly fussed whether that future is somewhere else. It has long been presumed that Chelsea will finish in the top four but with four games to go they have plenty of work to do. They will be hoping Lage’s warning fell on closed ears and Wolves continue their current sleepwalk to the end of the campaign. BG Chelsea v Wolves, Saturday 3pm Leicester jetteing off to Rome for a Thursday night Europa Conference League tie would appear to play into the hands of Everton, who remain in the relegation places despite grinding out an unlikely win against Chelsea last Sunday. The problem? The only time this season Everton have won on the road was against Brighton on 28 August, a result that left them sixth, with two wins and a draw from their opening three matches. Heady days. Fast-forward to the current, anxiety-ridden run-in and Sunday would seem a good time for them to double their tally of away wins for the campaign. Leicester will not be at full strength after their efforts in Europe, which must be a concern for Everton’s fellow relegation candidates, Leeds and Burnley. How much has that stirring win against Chelsea boosted Everton’s brittle confidence? LM Leicester v Everton, Sunday 2pm When the fixtures came out last summer, Southampton at home in May could have been the kind of fixture Brentford fans would hope to be an end-of-season stroll, a calm celebration of safety – like a pre-season friendly but with an actual full house. It’s almost come to pass. Almost. What might have been a chance for fans to just kick back and enjoy Christian Eriksen’s elegance or a James Ward-Prowse set piece or two will be laced with just a touch of anxiety. With Burnley and Everton fighting hard below them, both sides could do with more than their tally of 40 points. Despite having the rare misfortune to catch Manchester United on a good day on Monday, Brentford should have the current form to carry them home while Ralph Hussenhüttl’s side have also turned in a few decent displays of late, notably in the win over Arsenal. All of which should provide the combination of quality and urgency to make this a game well worth watching. TD Brentford v Southampton, Saturday 3pm A penny for the thoughts of Dean Smith, who could have enjoyed some well-earned downtime after his dismissal from Aston Villa but chose instead to sup immediately from what has turned out to be a predictably poisoned chalice offered to him by Norwich. While he has not done a particularly bad job in East Anglia with the very limited players at his disposal, he has certainly not done a very good one and now has the stain of relegation on an otherwise impressive managerial CV. With West Ham visiting on Sunday for a game that is of little consequence to either team, this keen chess player could be forgiven for giving serious thought to his next move.

5/6/2022,"When Adam Reynolds ran onto Olympic Stadium on Thursday night, South Sydney fans were flummoxed. The local boy who had grown up a spiral kick from Redfern Oval, won a premiership with Souths in 2014 and captained the Rabbitohs to the 2021 grand final, had come home in a once-unthinkable form: captain and talisman of the Brisbane Broncos. It was a year since Reynolds announced he was trading Redfern for Red Hill. After nine years bleeding red and green the club had deemed him fit for only a one year extension. Reynolds believed he had more to give so took a three year $2.4m deal with Brisbane. “I had four young kids and my salary was about to be cut in half,” he told reporters this week. “I was fine with that, but I wanted two years. There are no hard feelings. A decision had to be made [and] I made the decision to look after my family… it’s business at the end of the day.” But to Souths fans who greeted the “Reyno” return with groans it was far from business. It was like seeing a photo of your ex on another’s arm. You couldn’t begrudge them happiness, you respected their evolution and wished them well, but your heart asks your brain: what if? What if Souths chiefs had prioritised making a local junior and club leader a one-club man? What if Reynolds, having banked almost millions in contracts, had put loyalty ahead of lucre? And what if Reynolds’ last act as a Rabbitoh had been landing that grand final conversion to level it up at 14-14, then nailing a two-point field goal with a minute left to win a premiership? But there are no “ifs” in history. Reynolds missed those kicks, and the title, and is a Bronco. Having sat out the team’s round one match-up in March with Covid (a game the Broncos won 11-4), Reynolds ran out to face his old team – and their 30,456 members – for the first time on Thursday night. On paper, it was sixth playing ninth and two teams with a 4-4 win-loss record facing off. But really it was Adam Reynolds versus South Sydney and everyone knew it. At the kick-off Reynolds stood as close as he could to his old teammates, the arrowhead of his team’s attack. It was a statement. As play got underway he dropped behind the line, daring Souths forwards to come at him, while steering his side upfield, a jockey tucking low and whispering in the ear of his mount. Rugby league is a power game but it’s the little guys like Reynolds who make the magic. With a blacksmith’s wrists Reynolds was soon shooting bullet passes and floating cut-outs with deadly effect. With his boots he bombed, stabbed and grubbered kicks for teammates who leapt and dove at his signal. Some actions created pressure, others produced points. Each put Brisbane further in front and made the Reynolds-less Souths look rudderless. Between the big plays, the vision to try and the power to execute, was guile. As the Bunker ruled on a Souths no-try, Reynolds spoke calculatedly with the referee and linesmen. Where his opposite number and heir Lachlan Ilias took a penalty near the sideline and clunked a kick two metres upfield on the same side, Reynolds reefed it to the far side and made 25 metres. Embarrassed by an enemy of their own making, Souths lost the plot, coughed up more possession playing catch-up, and Reynolds calmly turned the screws and cashed in. Having set up two tries already – one with his hands, another with his feet – Reynolds scored one of his own with simple support play, running with a buffalo and scooping up the offload then shimmy-shimmying under the posts. It was a mouse pounce manoeuvre he’d pulled many times for Souths but now he triumphantly banged a chest that sports a Broncos crest. As Reynolds lined up the conversion, Souths fans razzed him but their heart wasn’t in it. The club’s greatest point scorer, whom they’d loved for 231 games was mastering, nay monstering, his old team and all they could do was ask what if? Brisbane won 32-12 despite Souths’ 54% possession and 43 tackles to 13 inside the opposition 20. The difference – with a hand in four tries, one of his own and six goals from six attempts – was Reynolds. When the dust settled on his young, unfancied team’s third straight win and their entry into the NRL top eight, Reynolds embraced old teammates Cody Walker and Latrell Mitchell. As young Trent Peoples celebrated with family after debuting as Rabbitoh No 1,179, Reggie the Rabbit shyly moved in and gave Reynolds a long hug. Eventually the little No 7 moved to the fence and a young Souths fan in The Burrow whose banner read: We Still Love Reynolds. Kids in red and green and maroon and gold flocked to salute this little man standing tall. Half an hour after the siren, Reynolds was still out there. He gave his boots away to a girl, his socks to a couple of young brothers, and signed and selfied until everyone was happy. Finally, Reynolds waddled off, barefoot as the boy who’d learned his craft on Redfern Oval. In a parallel universe, this stadium might have hosted the 2021 grand final and Reynolds’ final game in his old colours. Maybe at the scene of so many triumphs he’d have kicked straight. Regardless, a champion’s return home should have been commemorated by his old club. As it was, Reynolds rendered his own farewells to the Souths faithful, quietly and humbly. “Come back Adam!” yelled a kid as the little general shuffled to the exits. But he didn’t. He waved and disappeared up the tunnel and everyone moved on.",Sport/Sport,Souths left to wonder ‘what if’ as Adam Reynolds gets down to business for Broncos | Angus Fontaine,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/may/06/souths-left-to-wonder-what-if-as-adam-reynolds-gets-down-to-business-for-broncos
5/6/2022,"David Moyes apologised for losing his cool after West Ham’s manager was sent off for lashing out at a ballboy as his side’s hopes of reaching the Europa League final were ended by Eintracht Frankfurt. Moyes, who was disappointed after West Ham fell to a 3-1 defeat on aggregate, admitted that he had no defence after he lost his cool with a time-wasting local. “I kicked a ball back at the ballboy so I apologise for that,” the Scot said. “He threw it very softly at me.” West Ham were up against it after losing Aaron Cresswell to a foolish red card after 19 minutes. Cresswell was dismissed for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity when he fouled Jens Petter Hauge and Frankfurt, who will face Rangers in the final in Seville, made the most of their numerical advantage when Rafael Borré scored the only goal of the game. Moyes, who criticised Frankfurt’s coaching staff for appealing for Cresswell to be sent off, was proud of his side’s efforts with 10 men. “Things didn’t go for us on the night,” he said. “I’m really proud of the players. How they played with 10 men was fantastic. Other teams would have folded. But they boys here are great. Tough boys. “I just feel disappointment because this was a chance. We’ve played better teams than Frankfurt. If we’re being honest, we probably lost the game in the first 30 seconds of the game at the London Stadium where we conceded a goal. Really from that moment we’ve been chasing the game ever since.” The pain was huge in West Ham’s dressing room. “We’re gutted in there,” Declan Rice said. “We’ve come so far as a group. We’re proud as well to go down to 10 men and put in that shift. I’ve lost big games, lads in there have lost big games, but I come off with my chest held high.” On a demoralising night for West Ham it also emerged that a visiting fan was arrested for making a Nazi salute inside the ground. “Our forces arrested a person in the guest block who had previously shown the Hitler salute,” Frankfurt Police tweeted.",Sport/Football,Moyes sorry for kicking ball at ballboy during West Ham’s Europa League exit,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/05/moyes-sorry-for-kicking-ball-at-ballboy-during-west-hams-europa-league-exit
