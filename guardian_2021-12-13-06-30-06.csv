12/13/2021,"Max Verstappen celebrated winning his first Formula One world championship with victory at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, but only after huge controversy, that still leaves his title in some doubt. Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes are angry at a win they felt had been unfairly snatched away and which remains under debate with Mercedes intending to appeal the stewards’ decision and the option of taking their case to the court of arbitration for sport. The Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, has made clear his intention to oppose any attempt to strip his driver of the title.  A tense battle at the Yas Marina circuit was decided on the final lap in this final race of the season when Verstappen overtook Hamilton for the win to seal the championship after a fiercely-contested 22 meetings. Yet in doing so his Red Bull team and Mercedes were left at loggerheads over how the win had been achieved, with Mercedes taking a barrister to their meetings with the stewards. Their protests were rejected but while they were taking place a discontented Hamilton opted to take no part in the post-race press conference. He had gone into the race equal on points with Verstappen attempting to win his eighth title and was hugely disappointed but had congratulated his rival on the victory. The flashpoint came after Verstappen pitted during a late safety car period for fresh tyres with which to attack Hamilton and then what Mercedes saw as an unfair FIA intervention to ensure he was on Hamilton’s tail for that final lap shootout. Horner had requested the FIA race director, Michael Masi, act to allow the lapped cars between Verstappen and Hamilton to unlap themselves leaving the title protagonists closed up for the crucial final lap. Having initially stated they would not be allowed to do so, it was then announced that those five cars specifically could unlap themselves. Horner was convinced it had been the right decision but admitted that without an intervention Hamilton would have been uncatchable. “We needed something from the racing gods in the last 10 laps,” he said referring to the safety car prompted by Nicholas Latifi’s accident. He then issued a bullish response after the post-race wrangling had taken place. “It’s obviously a little bit desperate,” he said of the Mercedes protests. “If they appeal it we will fight it in the appeal court and then the legal court after that. Maybe I need a barrister on the pit wall with me. We didn’t want it to finish in front of the stewards.” Hamilton’s only comments were those made in the moments immediately after climbing from his car and before the protests were made. “Big congratulations to Max and his team,” he said. “We did an amazing job this year. It’s been the most difficult of seasons and I’m so proud of them, so grateful to be part of the journey with them. “We gave it everything, we gave it absolutely everything, we never gave up, and that’s the most important thing.” Verstappen acknowledged that without the final safety car he would have been unable to catch Hamilton but was unequivocal in his belief the stewards had made the right decision to allow the final lap of racing. “Everything was clear, so why would you run another lap behind a safety car?” he said. “When everything is clear you have to release the track. I think that’s a fair point from the race direction.” In a season that has become marked by increasingly acrimonious and ill-tempered exchanges between the two teams this was a nadir with the finale decided over bitter disagreement. Verstappen believed Mercedes’ protests and the controversy was indicative of how fractious the relationship had become. “It sums up, a little bit, the season,” he said of their attempts to overturn the result. McLaren’s Lando Norris believed the decision had been made deliberately to provide a climactic finale after he had not expected to be given permission to unlap himself. “It was obviously made to be a fight,” he said. “It was for the TV, of course. It was for the result. Whether or not it was fair, it’s hard for me to decide.” The former world champion Damon Hill noted that the reaction at Mercedes to what they judge as an unfair and arbitrary decision-making process could have much wider ramifications in them potentially considering their future in the sport. “It’s a huge problem,” said Hill. “Because a company like Mercedes will say: ‘If you’re not going to adjudicate the sport properly, if it’s going to be done on a whim, to say, ‘let them race,’ then they’ll just say: ‘We’re not playing’.”",Sport/Sport,Verstappen crowned world champion but Mercedes to appeal against result,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/12/max-verstappen-f1-world-champion-mercedes-lewis-hamilton-intend-to-appeal-result

12/13/2021,"The wording of the four home nations’ chief medical officers joint statement on Sunday was undramatic but still ominous. “Transmission of Covid-19 is already high in the community, mainly still driven by Delta, but the emergence of Omicron adds additional and rapidly increasing risk to the public and healthcare services.” Given that “vaccine protection against symptomatic disease from Omicron is reduced … hospitalisations from Omicron are already occurring and these are likely to increase rapidly”, they added.  The growing threat means the urgent twin imperatives of all policy now are to save lives and prevent the NHS becoming overwhelmed by what Boris Johnson in his televised address called “the tidal wave of Omicron coming”. The UK Health Security Agency has already warned that the new variant could produce 1m infections a day by New Year’s Eve. Johnson’s message and tone made clear the urgency of the threat. He made clear that vaccination is the main – in reality the sole – meaningful tactic the government has chosen to pursue both outcomes, given another lockdown or anything resembling it is for now not on the cards. As the prime minister said: “To hit the pace we need, we’ll need to match the NHS’s best vaccination day yet – and then beat it day after day. This will require an extraordinary effort.” In simple terms that means doing 1m or more boosters a day from now on, especially as he brought the deadline for everyone in England to have been offered a top-up from 31 January to 31 December. Bear in mind that the record number of jabs administered in one day across the UK to date was 844,285 on 20 March and that the most since the booster rollout began in September was 699,192 on 10 November. For an NHS already under the most intense pressure it has ever faced, this is a massive task. It means that for an undetermined period GPs and their teams will have to provide less of the care they usually give to patients as delivering huge numbers of boosters becomes their top priority. Hospitals will also come under more strain once Omicron leads to more people being admitted who are seriously ill. As Johnson acknowledged, the “extraordinary effort” will come at a price. “As we focus on boosters and make this new target achievable, it will mean some other appointments will need to be postponed until the New Year. But if we don’t do this now, the wave of Omicron could be so big that cancellations and disruptions, like the loss of cancer appointments, would be even greater next year.” He did not quantify how many fewer GP consultations, operations and outpatient appointments will now not happen in the weeks ahead. It is impossible to know what those numbers will be. But given GPs see more than 20m patients a month, they will be measured in the many millions. The backlog of people awaiting hospital care in England is already just shy of 6 million. The widespread cancellation of hip and knee replacements, cataract removals and other planned operations will send that soaring. This is a strategy of short-term pain for long-term gain. The initial reaction from NHS bosses was one of support. As one official said: “NHS leaders will be fine with the plan as they recognise that the likely pressures from Omicron could be very serious. But they will need the PM and ministers to make clear that the number one and number two priorities are delivering the booster – and first and second doses to those who haven’t been jabbed – and dealing with medical emergencies. That means non-urgent ops and so on will likely be pushed back but hopefully this is for a specific period of time as we race to get as many people jabbed as possible.” Hospital bosses are acutely aware of the terrible human cost of the huge backlog of people waiting for planned care, mainly surgery – anxiety, pain, inability to lead a normal life and in some cases less chance of surviving their illness – and have made strenuous efforts this year to perform as many non-urgent operations as possible. They will hate to have to start cancelling surgery again, especially as no one will be able to give patients affected any real sense of when they will finally be treated. But they will have to do it. GPs will feel the same about putting such a large amount of normal care on hold for patients but again have no choice. But medical need does not magically disappear, though. The next few weeks, possibly months, are going to be tough for anyone who relies on the health service as well as those who work in it. Both will hope that the sacrifices involved turn out to be worth it.",News/World news,UK’s 1m a day booster rollout is strategy of short-term pain for long-term gain,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/12/uks-1m-a-day-booster-rollout-is-strategy-of-short-term-pain-for-long-term-gain
12/13/2021,"Ambitious plans have been announced for all adults in England to receive their Covid booster by the end of the year.  Two weeks ago, the prime minister said every eligible adult would be offered a booster by the end of January. That has now been brought forward a month with all over-18s who had their second dose of the vaccine at least three months ago able to get their booster from Monday. Experts have said Omicron infections are doubling in the UK every two to three days and a report by the UK Health and Security Agency found that two doses of a Covid vaccine offers less defence against symptomatic infection from the Omicron variant than with Delta but a booster raised the level of protection. Everyone aged 18 and over will be able to go into a walk-in centre to get the vaccine from Monday. Some vaccine centres had already been allowing younger people to get jabs despite NHS England not officially rolling out boosters for under-40s (they were to be extended to over-30s before the prime minister’s announcement). With age priority scrapped, it is likely to lead to a scramble by people to get vaccinated, particularly so their immune response kicks in before Christmas when many younger people will be intending to visit elderly relatives, who they will not want to risk infecting. A similar scramble is likely to occur on Wednesday when the NHS booking system will open for everyone aged 18 plus. By Sunday 46.7m people had had a second dose, while 23.1m had had a booster, a difference of 23.6m. They will not all be adults but most will, given second jabs for under-18s were only approved just under a month ago. Even if there were 20m adults still to have a booster that would require administering almost 1 million doses a day, and that is without accounting for Christmas Day and Boxing Day when the appetite for giving and receiving boosters is likely to be low. On Saturday, 592,337 people of all ages received a dose but totals are generally higher on Saturdays. The highest figure on a weekday last week was 527,342. In May, it was reported that the government wanted to vaccinate 800,000 a day, rising to as many as one million people a day as part of a drive to save the British summer, amid the threat posed by the Delta variant. However, the peak reached in May was 762,361. The highest number of new vaccinations reported in one day in the UK was 844,285 on 20 March – a figure that will probably need to be surpassed every day to hit the government target. To try to achieve it, Boris Johnson said the government will be deploying 42 military planning teams and setting up additional vaccine sites and mobile units and extending opening hours so clinics are open seven days a week, earlier and later. But it is still likely to require GPs and other health professionals to forgo other responsibilities to deliver boosters at at time when waiting lists for routine operations are at record levels and one senior health figure said the NHS is “on its knees”.",News/World news,The new plans for Covid booster jabs and how to get one – explained,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/12/he-new-plans-for-covid-booster-jabs-and-how-to-get-one
12/13/2021,"Shortly after the most chaotic and enthralling finish to a Formula One title in the sport’s history, Max Verstappen stood on top of his Red Bull car, fists pumping and shaking as if a lightning bolt was surging through him, before making a flying dismount, Frankie Dettori style. Who could blame him? Somehow, against the odds, he had muscled past Lewis Hamilton during a dramatic final lap shootout in the last race of 2021. A first world title was secured. Yet this thriller of an F1 season still had one final vicious twist to come. While the Dutch driver was celebrating, Hamilton’s Mercedes’ team had spotted two apparent breaches of the rulebook. An appeal went in. Barristers were consulted. Suddenly this was no longer a sporting contest, but a legal one.  And so the world waited. It took until 11pm local time in Abu Dhabi – more than four hours after Verstappen had finished two seconds ahead of Hamilton – for the stewards to reject both Mercedes’ appeals. It was official. Verstappen really was the world champion. “I’m very relieved,” the Dutchman admitted. “It has been a very stressful day. I’m going to have a tiny drink.” There was then a firm hug for Red Bull principal Christian Horner, who pronounced that the right man had won. “I am disappointed we had to go through that but it has been an amazing year,” Horner said. “He is a deserved world champion and nobody can take that away from him.” Mercedes certainly tried. First on the track. Then on a lengthy and torturous appeal. The myriad twists and turns of what happened in Abu Dhabi will make great content for the Netflix series, Drive To Survive, which has attracted millions of new fans to F1. But it also felt unsatisfactory for such an intense contest to be settled in the stewards’ room. The race itself? Well, that was bookended by stunning stanzas at the start and finish, and a sedate middle eight. Verstappen overspun when the lights went off, allowing his rival to go clear. But the Dutchman quickly recovered and on turn six dived on the inside, forcing Hamilton to cut the chicane. It was a smart move and most experts felt Verstappen should have been given the lead. The stewards disagreed. After the adrenalised openingthat, the race settled into an uncomplicated narrative: Hamilton leading, Verstappen chasing, but without ever threatening to mount a serious challenge. By lap 53 the Englishman’s long waltz to victory appeared nearly complete, and he was ready to greet the highest step of the podium like an old friend. At this point Red Bull had pretty much given up too. As Horner admitted with 10 laps remaining: “The pace of the Mercedes is just too strong today. In all honesty they have just had a quicker car. We are going to need a miracle.” Then, from nowhere, Red Bull got an almighty slice of luck. With five of the 58 laps to go Nicholas Latifi crashed his Williams, forcing the safety car out. Red Bull called Verstappen in for new tyres. But initially it didn’t seem to matter. Laps 54, 55, 56 came and went with the safety car still out and Latifi’s car still not cleared. Then in a few remarkable seconds the race, and the championship, supercharged into life again. First Latifi’s vehicle was cleared. Then Michael Masi made the fateful decision to allow five lapped cars to overtake the safety car, which suddenly meant a shootout between Verstappen and Hamilton. As they waited for the signal to go, centimetres separated them. Hamilton had the faster car, but worn tyres. It proved too much of a handicap. Verstappen launched past him, then fended him off as the pair nearly touched wheels, before speeding home. Yet the title race wasn’t over yet. Mercedes had spotted an apparent breach of sporting regulation 48.8, with Verstappen inching ahead of Hamilton under the safety car before the start of the last lap. The stakes couldn’t have been any higher. Red Bull knew that if the FIA sided with Mercedes, a potential punishment could include a five-second penalty, which would demote Verstappen to second and give Hamilton the title. Mercedes also argued that article 48.12, relating to lapped cars being allowed to overtake the safety car, had also been breached by race director Masi in the final dramatic stages. “This was so not right,” fumed Mercedes’ Toto Wolff after Masi’s decision. Masi responded: “It’s a motor race, we went car racing.” It took some time but both appeals were eventually rejected – with the FIA saying the Dutchman had not broken any rules and that Masi had flexibility under the rulebook to control the safety car. Many will disagree with that decision. But can you really blame him for wanting a head-to-head clash to settle a world title, rather than a last-lap procession behind a safety car? “It’s unbelievable,” said Verstappen afterwards. “Throughout the whole race I kept fighting and then the opportunity came in the last lap. It’s insane. This year will go down in history. Miracles do happen.” Hamilton, meanwhile, took his defeat with impressive grace, immediately hugging Verstappen and wishing him well. This result means the 36-year-old remains level with Michael Schumacher on seven titles. Still, he has time – and the fastest car in the paddock – on his side.",Sport/Sport,"Max Verstappen finds out miracles happen, in the form of a safety car | Sean Ingle",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/dec/12/max-verstappen-finds-out-miracles-happen-in-the-form-of-a-safety-car
