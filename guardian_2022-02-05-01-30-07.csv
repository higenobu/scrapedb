2/5/2022,"This year just happens to be the 1,900th anniversary of the building of Hadrian’s Wall and it feels almost as long since English rugby fans headed north with so much apprehension. While the Calcutta Cup “only” dates back to 1879, Scotland have rarely been as fancied to retain the venerable trophy or inflict successive Six Nations defeats on their neighbours for the first time in 38 years. The weather is slightly ominous, too. While Met Office forecasts have improved since AD122, when the emperor Hadrian sought to protect the Roman empire by constructing a 73-mile barrier between the Tyne and the Solway Firth, some things never change. Let’s just say few would choose to be erecting much, or catching rugby balls, in the heavy rain and gusty winds reportedly heading Murrayfield’s way.  Foul conditions are not exactly alien to this fixture and England did just about manage to see off Storm Ciara and Scotland at Murrayfield two years ago. This time it could be that the worst of the tempest will have passed through by kick-off but a settled, ambitious Scotland side, having triumphed at Twickenham 12 months ago, have it in them to unleash a devastating storm of their own making. If the burden of favouritism has never sat comfortably on dark blue shoulders, there are good reasons why Gregor Townsend’s side should not be taken lightly. They have a generous sprinkling of Lions, increasing depth and, in Finn Russell, a potential matchwinner in any company. England, by contrast, lack some totemic figures, with more than half their reshuffled starting XV about to played their first Tests in Scotland. Two years ago young Freddie Steward featured in the U20s fixture at a chilly Myreside but a packed, hostile Murrayfield will be a wholly different proposition The ghosts of wet, windy Calcutta Cups past will also be roaming the Edinburgh gloaming. No Scot will easily forget Duncan Hodge’s slithering try in 2000 - as well as the famous “Battlers 19 Bottlers 13” headline the next day - nor the two similarly damp ambushes in 2006 and 2008 at the expense of English teams guided by Andy Robinson and Brian Ashton respectively. Nowadays, though, Scotland have the ability to impose themselves regardless of the elements. England were a touch fortunate to sneak home two years ago and were well beaten in 2018 when, with Russell whirling his baton, the hosts won 25-13. What a stark – and welcome – contrast it was to the 2014 post-match mood when the fixture had become so one-sided – and the Murrayfield pitch so parasite-infected – that the case for promotion to the Six Nations felt stronger than ever. The Anglo-Scottish wheel has now turned full circle. England have failed to win three of the last four Calcutta Cup fixtures and will need to dig deep if the Duchess of Cambridge, the Rugby Football Union’s newly-minted patron, is to get one over the Princess Royal, her opposite number at the Scottish Rugby Union. The tactical jousting between the coaches will also be fascinating, with Townsend certain to urge his forwards to complicate the life of Ben Youngs, winning his 113th England cap, and his red rose half-back partner Marcus Smith. England were way too slow and ill-disciplined at Twickenham 12 months ago but, perversely, it may have done them a favour in retrospect. Jones, having opted to ditch the stifling, risk-averse rugby he had previously advocated, has now chosen the most mobile side at his disposal, supported by some heavy-duty “finishers” on the bench, and has given the visitors a puncher’s chance as a result. As it happens the head coach is friendly with the Celtic manager Ange Postecoglou and would settle for a similar outcome to Wednesday night’s Old Firm derby. The only snag is that Scotland have also picked a canny-looking XV and know precisely what they are looking to do. Stay disciplined, build momentum, make England fretful, take their chances and, most crucially of all, keep playing for the full 80 minutes. Last time out against South Africa in the autumn the Scottish thistle wilted disappointingly after the visitors had been 10-8 down at the interval. England, by contrast, held on to defeat the Springboks 27-26 at Twickenham the following Saturday and will cling to the belief that, coming down the stretch, they can conjure up something similarly satisfying. If anyone is going to be in the mood for some conjuring, though, it is Russell and it was no surprise to hear Anthony Seibold, England’s gravel-voiced Australian defence coach, acknowledging his new side cannot give the home fly-half the luxury of time or space. In that regard the most pivotal English players could be Sam Simmonds and Elliot Daly, both of whom have had to bide their time prior to their starting recalls this week. Simmonds will be expected to carry plenty of ball and pierce the Scottish advantage line and also make his presence felt at the breakdown. Daly, finally back in his preferred 13 jersey, will also need to be at his defensive best against Chris Harris, Stuart Hogg and Duhan van Der Merwe, all fellow Lions tourists last summer. Without Owen Farrell, Courtney Lawes and assorted others it promises to be a test of English resilience all round. The ‘r’ word has been frequently heard in their camp this week but, ultimately, there is no particular need for England’s new captain Tom Curry, his country’s youngest skipper since 1988, to deliver a lengthy speech for his troops. The potential implications of this contest should already be obvious enough, with the tournament prospects of both squads inextricably linked to the outcome. Send the English home empty-handed and Townsend’s army, with France also due to travel to Murrayfield, can cautiously begin to dream about a potentially epic campaign. Should England, alternatively, somehow overcome all the hassles of recent weeks they will head to Rome next week suddenly free of self-doubt and believing that anything is possible. It should be a belting game either way. Is it ever so slightly telling that England have declined to allow cameras into their dressing room while Scotland have had no such qualms? It threatens to be a day of drenched coats, sodden kilts and dripping sporrans but clear eyes and full hearts will also be required on the field. There have been reports this week of unusually high numbers of trees and plants blooming early because of global warming. The Flower of Scotland could soon be among them.",Sport/Sport,Scotland take on England with unfamiliar favourite’s mantle,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/feb/04/scotland-take-on-england-with-unfamiliar-favourites-mantle
2/5/2022,"Boris Johnson quoted from the Lion King to No 10 staff on Friday morning, telling them “change is good” amid mass resignations. The prime minister channelled the sage figure of Rafiki the mandrill as he attempted to boost morale, his spokesperson confirmed.  “As Rafiki in The Lion King says, change is good, and change is necessary even though it’s tough,” Johnson said.. It comes amid a wholesale clearout of Downing Street, sparked by the resignation on Thursday of policy chief Munira Mirza – an ally of 14 years – who criticised Johnson for his “scurrilous” Jimmy Savile attacks on the Labour leader, Keir Starmer. After Mirza’s departure, resignations of four aides followed: Dan Rosenfield, chief of staff, Martin Reynolds, Johnson’s principal private secretary, Jack Doyle, director of communications, and Elena Narozanski, a No 10 policy unit member. The Lion King comments mark another children’s story reference entering Johnson’s oeuvre of bizarre quotations, from Peppa Pig to James Bond to Kermit the Frog. During a speech widely criticised as “rambling” and lacking seriousness, Johnson stunned the British business community by expounding the benefits of Peppa Pig World – and its mass transport system. “Yesterday I went, as we all must, to Peppa Pig World. Hands up if you’ve been to Peppa Pig World,” Johnson asked the Confederation of British Industry in November. “I loved it. Peppa Pig World is very much my kind of place,” he went on. “It has very safe streets, discipline in schools, heavy emphasis on new mass transit systems. Even if they’re a bit stereotypical about Daddy Pig.” At the UN Cop26 summit in Glasgow in November, Johnson was called a “clown” after referencing Kermit the Frog when making the case for going green. “When Kermit the Frog sang It’s Not Easy Bein’ Green I want you to know he was wrong,” Johnson said. “It’s not only easy, it’s lucrative and it’s right to be green – and he was also unnecessarily rude to Miss Piggy, I thought.” The prime minister was criticised for “incredible insensitivity” after reciting a poem by Rudyard Kipling, author of pro-empire work such as The White Man’s Burden, during a trip to Myanmar in 2017. Johnson, then foreign secretary, recited the opening verse to The Road to Mandalay, including the line: “The temple bells they say / Come you back you English soldier.” The British Empire ruled Myanmar – then called Burma – from 1824 to 1948. The UK ambassador to Myanmar, Andrew Patrick, intervened, telling Johnson: “No. Not appropriate.” At Cop26, Johnson used James Bond to welcome world leaders to the UK. “Welcome to Glasgow, and to Scotland, whose most globally famous fictional son is almost certainly a man called James Bond – who generally comes to the climax of his highly lucrative films strapped to a doomsday device desperately trying to work out which coloured wire to pull to turn it off,” he said. “A red digital clock ticks down remorselessly to a detonation that will end human life as we know it, and we are in roughly the same position, my fellow global leaders, as James Bond today. “Except that the tragedy is this is not a movie, and the doomsday device is real.” Johnson seemed to flout climate activist Greta Thunberg’s advice during Cop26: “No more blah blah blah.”",News/Politics,From The Lion King to Peppa Pig: Boris Johnson’s repertoire of bizarre quotations,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/04/the-lion-king-peppa-pig-boris-johnson-bizarre-quotations
2/5/2022,"Once again Northern Ireland is in the headlines. Stormont is on the brink of collapse and the febrile politics of orange, green and everything in between is exposed to all who do not live there. An election for the Stormont assembly looms in May and on Friday the Democratic Unionist party raised the stakes again.  If the withdrawal of the first minister and an order to halt Brexit food checks mandated under the Northern Ireland protocol was not enough to convince voters it was serious in its battle against the EU and its “cheerleaders” on local territory, it also made veiled threats about its ability to return to power-sharing after the polls if the Brexit issues it is fighting are not resolved. But behind all of the melodrama lie several basic issues: the DUP is battling to recover support in the polls and Boris Johnson’s promises to address the party’s concerns over the checks are stalling. The DUP’s leader, Jeffrey Donaldson, revealed on Friday that the prime minister had told him it would take just three weeks to get a new deal on the protocol last October. More than three months later, Johnson is still arguing the case but is not cancelling the protocol. Yes Johnson has shown he likes to keep the Brexit pot boiling, recently accusing Brussels of implementing the Northern Ireland protocol in an “insane and pettifogging way”. The PM also told Donaldson last week that there was just a 20-30% chance of a new Brexit deal in the next few weeks, so the party may have been wise not to heed his earlier promises. By walking out of Stormont’s first minister’s office, the DUP is signalling that it wants the protocol to be centre stage for the approaching election. It may not be a winning argument as Lord Frost and others, before and after his resignation as Brexit minister, have never agreed that the protocol will be scrapped. For this reason Ulster Unionist party (UUP) leader, Doug Beattie, described the DUP drama this week as “crazy”, futile, “as the protocol will still be there” after the election. Gavin Barwell, Theresa May’s former chief of staff, was equally blunt. “It should now be clear to the DUP that supporting Brexit was a huge strategic error for them and unionism in NI. It’s reduced support for the Union. It’s led to a border in the Irish Sea (because the ERG prefer that to the alternative – customs union + regulatory alignment),” he tweeted this week. The stakes for the DUP in that post-Brexit world could not be higher. Sinn Féin remains on course to overtake the DUP as the largest single party in Northern Ireland for the first time, with the UUP snapping at the DUP’s heels. Recent polls give Sinn Féin 25% of the vote, eight points ahead of the DUP and on course to take the first minister’s position. This is a nightmare scenario for the DUP which has over recent months refused to confirm whether it would participate in a coalition with a Sinn Féin first minister or take up the role of deputy first minister if returned as the second biggest party. On the unionist front it is fighting a re-energised UUP which was placed in joint-third place with the Alliance party in the most recent opinion poll in January. While the UUP make have taken a knock from the recent row over historic tweets of its leader, Beattie, he is still in place and fighting to convince voters the party offers a more socially liberal outlook than the DUP. Polls south of the border have also seen an extraordinary rise in the popularity of Sinn Féin. Although the next general election in Ireland is three years away, the party is in contention to be part of a government in Dublin and the spectre of a border poll on a united Ireland haunts unionists. It is on this wider canvas that the events of this week have played out in Belfast.",News/UK news,Election fears form backdrop to DUP’s ‘crazy’ drama in Northern Ireland,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/04/election-fears-form-backdrop-to-dups-crazy-drama-in-northern-ireland
2/5/2022,"Mock “appeals for information” posters highlighting misogynistic, racist and homophobic comments made by police officers in Charing Cross police station have been erected in London to increase pressure on the government to launch an inquiry into misogyny within the police. A-board signs were put up on Friday mimicking those used by police after a serious incident, which protesters led by the Women’s Equality party said was an exchange that took place between officers, in which one said: “Knock a bird about and she will love you. Human nature. They are biologically programmed to like that s***.”  Earlier this week, the police watchdog revealed details of officers sharing messages about hitting and raping women, as well as the deaths of black babies and the Holocaust. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) says the hateful and offensive remarks were part of a Met culture that needed to be rooted out. The Guardian revealed that one of the officers, who was disciplined after an inquiry into the messages, has since been promoted. “We are tired of being told it’s a few bad apples. How much more evidence does the home secretary need that misogyny is baked into our police forces?” said Mandu Reid, the leader of the Women’s Equality party. “Unless there is a proper inquiry, with statutory powers, the culture in our police forces will never change.” After the murder of Sarah Everard by the serving police officer Wayne Couzens last year, the home secretary, Priti Patel, announced a public inquiry, as the case exposed “unimaginable failures in policing”. But the non-statutory inquiry will examine only whether chances were missed to identify Couzens as a danger to women before he attacked Everard in March 2021 and will not look at wider misogyny in the force. The Centre for Women’s Justice, which was not involved in the protest, said the narrow focus of the inquiry missed a “once in a lifetime opportunity to look into and learn from many other cases of police perpetrated violence against women”. It has launched a fundraiser to challenge the decision, with lawyers to argue the inquiry is unlawful because it will fail to meet its stated aims. Harriet Wistrich, the director of the Centre for Women’s Justice, said she was “surprised but pleased” to hear about the action. “It demonstrates the strength of feeling from women across the country. We have similar concerns. If an inquiry has any chance of rooting out abusers and regaining women’s trust it needs proper powers and public scrutiny, which is a central plank of our case,” she said. A number of public figures, including the actors Olivia Colman, Sanjeev Bhaskar and Bronagh Waughs, called on the government to add misogyny to existing hate crime laws. The video was launched by the domestic abuse charity Refuge, which is backing proposals led by MPs including Stella Creasy and peers including Baroness Newlove to include misogyny as a hate crime in an amendment to the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill. Ruth Davison, Refuge’s CEO, said the amendment would give women and girls the same protections as other protected groups, help identify trends, enable tougher sentences and help women feel more confident coming forward. “Acceptance of systemic misogyny is why ‘locker-room banter’ that tries to make jokes about domestic abuse has been tolerated for years within the Met police force and in society more generally,” she said. “It is why crimes against women are not treated as the serious crimes that they are – as reflected in woefully low prosecution rates and weak sentencing.”",News/UK news,Fake serious incident signs erected in London to highlight police misogyny,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/04/fake-serious-incident-signs-erected-in-london-to-highlight-police-misogyny
2/5/2022,"With reinfections now included in the daily Covid case numbers for most countries in the UK, we take a look at why the shift matters.  Covid reinfections can involve either the same or a different variant. Since 31 January reinfections have been included in the daily reported case numbers for England and Northern Ireland. Reinfections are expected to be included for Scotland in weeks while they were already included in figures for Wales. While the definition of a reinfection for England and Northern Ireland is a positive specimen at least 90 days after the last one, for Wales that gap is at present defined as at least 42 days. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says a gap of at least 90 days captures the majority of reinfections, while excluding those for whom fragments of the virus are detected for a long period of time. The agency says the interval will be standardised across UK countries in the coming weeks. According to UKHSA data for England, at present, possible reinfections account for about 10% of new cases reported each week. An estimated 532,570 reinfection episodes have been identified in England between the beginning of the pandemic and 23 January this year. This is a small figure against the 14.2m cases believed to be first infections. However, these figures are based on people who have come forward for a Covid test. Not all those with a Covid infection do so – while during the first wave access to tests was very limited, meaning both cases and reinfections were underestimated. According to data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) – which uses an episode interval of 120 days, or four consecutive negative tests, in its definition of a reinfection – unvaccinated people have around twice the risk of reinfection compared with those who had their second Covid jab between 14 and 89 days ago. Reinfection also appears to be more likely among people whose previous infection was mild with a lower immune response, and among those who had their Covid jabs more than 90 days ago. But other factors are also at play. “Reinfection is a result of a combination of exposure and risk once exposed,” said Prof Rowland Kao, an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh and member of the modelling group Spi-M, adding the risk once exposed can be affected by elements such as the time since last infection, as well as past health. “What it seems like is that a lot of those factors do come together to potentially increase observed reinfection rates – so many of the people who are in high exposure jobs also are more likely to have health issues because the factors allied to deprivation are related to both,” he said. Yes. According to ONS data, the risk of reinfection was 16 times higher when Omicron became dominant in the UKcompared with when Delta dominated. That is not surprising: the variant has been found to be able to dodge the body’s immune responses to a significant degree. However, many of the new reinfections would have been among people who had Delta, or another variant, previously, given the first Omicron cases were only picked up in the UK in late November. The question remains how well those who have had Omicron are protected against a second Omicron infection, or infections with new variants.",News/World news,Covid reinfections: why are they being included in case numbers?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/04/covid-reinfections-why-being-included-case-numbers
2/5/2022,"Pep Guardiola has admitted to struggling in his relationship with João Cancelo early on before eventually coming to understand the defender. Cancelo signed a contract extension on Wednesday that ties him to Manchester City until 2027. The Portuguese is considered one the world’s finest full-backs, but after arriving at City in 2019 there was initially friction between him and Guardiola.  “Everyone knows how important he is and what he’s done,” said the manager. “We have struggled when he arrived - we did not agree on many things, partly because of my mistakes but now I am delighted. He’s fully happy and can play here for the next [few] seasons. João can play in many positions, can play every day due to his physicality, and he’s so funny and loved in the locker room.” Guardiola was asked what caused the friction. “Normally he’s playing every time now, that’s the main reason,” he said. “He wanted to play every time and when he didn’t wasn’t happy – he struggled with how we played, what we wanted to do, and that was the reason why but he was always a nice guy. Now he understands [and] we know each other better. But to be really clear: no arguments. João is fully happy, he wants to play every game and that’s all. “Every player has to be treated differently. He’s an incredible person with a big heart but sensitive. I needed time to understand him, now I understand him and he’s important for us. Every player has a world and you have to understand it. He’s one of the few we have who would play morning, afternoon, night. He needs the adrenalin from playing, like Phil Foden – football is the most important thing in his life.” Cancelo’s fresh deal follows those of Kevin De Bruyne, Ederson, John Stones, Ruben Dias, Cole Palmer and James McAtee. “This is so important,” said Guardiola. “The players know the club and we are a young team, we cannot forget that. We know them mentally - all of them love to play. Every season is different – we don’t know what will happen but the soul and the heart of the team is still young – and that’s important.” ",Sport/Football,Pep Guardiola reveals early friction with ‘sensitive’ João Cancelo,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/04/pep-guardiola-reveals-early-friction-with-sensitive-joao-cancelo
2/5/2022,"Nowhere to be seen are her company Goop’s own vagina candles, psychic vampire repeller sprays and toothpaste squeezers, and yet Gwyneth Paltrow’s home in Montecito, California is still causing gasps across the internet. As she showed off her palatial house in the March issue of Architectural Digest, many rolled their eyes online at designer Robin Standefer’s claim that it “takes its cues from Gwyneth’s height [and] beauty”.  Others were taken aback that her Ruth Asawa sculpture was actually a fake (“surely she could afford the real thing?”), by her grand hallway fireplace, which, Paltrow explained, was “something you see a lot in Europe in an entryway”, and by her super-luxurious double hammock in the living room that retails at $62,700. Could this maybe become the next must-have piece of homeware for the uber-rich? “I wouldn’t be surprised if this starts a whole new trend,” says Los Angeles estate agent Kirk Hawkins. “I think living room swings and indoor hammocks will always be perfect for a specific buyer: why not enjoy the whimsical experience of being a kid in an indoor space?” Others remain unconvinced. “I don’t think there will be anything other than a flash-in-the-pan demand for living room swings,” says Lucy Searle, the editor-in-chief of Homes & Gardens magazine. “It’s a lovely, appealing, though space-hungry, idea, but anyone with children will appreciate that it will either be a dangerous addition to a living room or one that will be gleefully misused.” The most surprising feature of the California house, however, is a fully fledged plant-filled, tiled spa, featuring hot tub, cold tub, sauna and steam room, resembling an “ancient bathhouse”, says Paltrow. “Just like Peloton took off, this is becoming more of a trend for high net worth individuals who want to bring the spa home with them,” says Hawkins. “They are growing in popularity,” agrees Searle. “Many renovators are asking interior designers and bathroom companies to find space for everything from home saunas and steam rooms to double showers and shower bench seats.” There were about 44,000 internet searches for “home spas” last year, according to the bathroom retailer AQVA. Paltrow worked with interior designers Robin Standefer and Stephen Alesch of Roman and Williams to create a home with the conceptual feel of a “Parisian apartment set within an old European barn”. Other notable features in the wannabe barn include a surreal “Star-Trek-like” chandelier, 3D handpainted wallpaper and almost enough casserole dishes to feed the whole of California. “There’s a lot of Pinterest-bait in it,” says the architecture journalist Lucy Watson. “Sometimes it’s hard to tell with other super-prime homes which is the CGI render and which is the real thing.” That said, Paltrow has hit upon some very 2022 luxury homeware trends. “Wallpaper generally is so popular now,” says interior designer Lucy Gleeson. “We are moving towards being more hands-on with wall decor.” Searle says handpainted wallpaper is one of Homes & Gardens’ top design trend predictions for 2022, and Watson says: “I am seeing people at home being a bit more adventurous with textures, panelling and painting shapes straight on the walls – which will set you back as much as a tin of paint and a roll of masking tape instead of a couple of grand per panel.” “Gwyneth will gain some extra design fans after they see her new home,” says Gleeson. Watson thinks the house almost humanises the often-derided Paltrow. “It’s a slightly cluttered house where you can actually imagine somebody living and cooking and acquiring normal people things. Given how alien Gwyneth’s lifestyle is to most people, perhaps that was a bit of a shock,” she says. And yet, Watson says she’s “not sure anything can erase the vagina egg from public memory”.",Arts/Film,"At home with Gwyneth Paltrow: 3D wallpaper, a spa and a $62,000 hammock",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/04/at-home-with-gwyneth-paltrow-3-d-wallpaper-a-spa-and-a-62000-hammock
2/5/2022,"The unexpected triumph of António Costa’s Socialist party in Portugal’s elections this week continues a cautious comeback by Europe’s centre-left – and, analysts say, may hold some lessons in what remains a mixed picture for the continent’s social democrats. After wins last autumn by Germany’s SPD and Norway’s Labour party, the Portuguese prime minister’s unexpected victory – with 41.7% of the vote, five points up on 2019 – was further good news for a movement that five years ago looked in terminal decline.  In some countries, it still does. The French Socialist party was all but obliterated in the 2017 elections and polls predict its candidate in this year’s presidential race, Anne Hidalgo, the Paris mayor, will do well to capture more than 3% in the first round, a barely imaginable score for a party once led by François Mitterrand and which, only a decade ago, controlled the Élysée, senate, parliament and most of France’s regions. The Dutch Labour party (PvdA) likewise collapsed to a record low in 2017, winning less than 6% of the vote and losing almost three-quarters of its MPs, and in parliamentary elections last year it failed dismally to improve on its score. And while the context in central and eastern Europe is different, the Czech Social Democrats (CSSD), who had won four of the six polls held since the country’s formation in 1993 and come second twice, lost so heavily in October that they are no longer even in parliament. Elsewhere, things are rosier: all five Nordic countries are led by centre-left governments; Italy’s Democratic party is a member of its ruling coalition; Pedro Sánchez’s PSOE heads a progressive alliance in Spain; and a social democrat chancellor, Olaf Scholz, leads a three-party left-liberal coalition in Germany. Political scientists point to multiple reasons for the decline of Europe’s centre-left over the past decade, and explanations for its cautious recent revival appear just as varied. “We should be very careful about generalising too much,” said Gérard Grunberg, an emeritus professor of European politics at Sciences Po in Paris. Social democratic parties with their roots in 19th-century labour movements could for decades count for their core vote on traditional, especially manual, workers – an electorate that has shrunk by as much as 50% in some countries. The 2008 financial crash and its economic fallout added anger over high unemployment and falling living standards to mounting alarm among many of those traditional voters at broader trends – globalisation, automation and immigration. Far-right parties played on those fears while, at the other end of the political spectrum, anti-capitalist, anti-globalisation, anti-establishment far-left parties proved equally attractive to another part of the centre-left voter pool: middle-class, often public sector, teachers, healthcare workers. The result was that as the mainstream parties of government grew smaller and insurgent parties got bigger, the centre-left found itself fatally squeezed. In some cases a revival has been almost automatic. “Sometimes it’s just been the pendulum of politics,” said Simon Hix, a comparative politics professor at the European University Institute in Florence. “People had simply had enough of the centre-right.” After 16 years of conservative-led government in Germany and eight in Norway, that may have been the case, but in Portugal it was not: Costa had been prime minister, at the head of unlikely leftwing alliances, since 2015. Some see his resounding win as at least partly reflecting local factors. “People argue Portugal still has a rather different occupational and class structure,” said Tarik Abou-Chadi, an associate professor of European politics at Oxford. “The knowledge economy, the people more likely to vote green or progressive left, haven’t quite reached it yet.” Production workers still make up a disproportionately high share of Portugal’s voters, even by southern European standards, and only about 55% of the country’s workforce have completed at least a secondary school education. But beyond possible structural factors, analysts see some broader trends – and even lessons – in this cautious social democratic comeback. Hix argues Europe’s conservative parties have drifted right to compete with the far right, “and that’s made liberal voters uncomfortable”. Public sector workers and young professionals “want grownups to run the country”. For Abou-Chadi, recent elections “have shown that if the left can coordinate, it can win”. But for social democrats to profit, they need to be “the main challenger on the left. And that’s not currently the case in, for example, France and the Netherlands.” According to Grunberg, the social democratic parties that have survived as main challengers and are now winning elections (albeit with scores often half what they once were) are those that adapted to the new political landscape. “Some have cooperated with parties to their right, others to their left,” he said. “There is a social democratic electorate: sharing humanist values, open to some degree of economic liberalism. But social democratic parties’ absolute priority must be to govern. And they need strong leaders.” Catherine de Vries, a Dutch political scientist at Bocconi University in Milan, put it slightly differently. Where social democrat parties had been successful – in the Nordics, Spain, Germany, Portugal – they had “repurposed”, she said. Between the third way’s love of economic liberalism and the radical left of the likes of Jean-Luc Mélenchon in France, she said, there was “a middle ground that says: the state can do things, it can protect, be a social elevator, and we are the party of the state – but we really can run it. We are a true party of government. We can do this.” A focus on “quite traditional, solid, straightforward social democratic ideas – better housing, improving low pay – but with the competence to deliver” had proved key, she said, but it required a strong, popular leader and the courage to take on “difficult issues like immigration: the culture war stuff”. All agreed that Costa exemplified that “safe pair of hands”: warm and charismatic but capable of delivering on wages and pensions while still promoting economic growth and maintaining fiscal discipline. “A voice of clear, steady reason in a changing and uncertain environment,” said de Vries. “That’s what the centre-left needs to be.”",News/World news,Costa’s win in Portugal continues comeback by Europe’s centre-left,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/04/antonio-costa-win-in-portugal-continues-comeback-by-europes-centre-left
2/5/2022,"Two of the most emblematic figures of Nicaragua’s beleaguered opposition are facing years behind bars after being convicted of alleged acts of political conspiracy in trials campaigners and members of the international community called a sham. Dora María Téllez, a legendary guerrilla leader during the Sandinista revolution, was found guilty during a closed-door trial at the notorious El Chipote political prison in Nicaragua’s capital Managua on Thursday.  Téllez, 66, helped liberate the city of León during 1979’s final push against the Somoza dictatorship and commanded the legendary storming of Nicaragua’s national palace the previous year. “[She was] a very beautiful girl, timid and withdrawn, with the kind of intelligence and good sense that would have ensured her great success in anything she turned he hand to,” the Colombian writer Gabriel García Márquez wrote of the 22-year-old student turned rebel in his account of the 1978 audacious assault. Lesther Alemán, a former student leader who became an overnight celebrity for berating Nicaragua’s authoritarian president, Daniel Ortega, during a failed 2018 uprising, was also convicted of “conspiracy to damage national integrity”. “I’m innocent,” the 24-year-old shouted after his verdict was delivered in El Chipote, according to the opposition newspaper La Prensa. Speaking to the Guardian at a Managua safehouse during the 2018 rebellion, Alemán said he sought political freedom, not fame, joking: “The cameras intimidate me more than Daniel Ortega.” Prosecutors reportedly sought jail terms of up to 15 years for Alemán and Téllez, who was Nicaragua’s health minister during the first post-revolution Sandinista government but later turned on Ortega and became a fierce critic. Thursday’s judgments – part of a wave of political trials currently playing out – drew criticism from across the region, including from the left. “Shameful,” Chile’s president-elect, Gabriel Boric, tweeted after Téllez’s conviction was reported. In a recent interview Zoilamérica Ortega Murillo, the estranged daughter of Ortega and his vice president and wife Rosario Murillo, voiced fear for the future of activists such as Alemán. “His bravery made me very afraid for him,” she said of his decision to publicly harangue Ortega in 2018. “I know this was an unforgivable challenge and that is why he is one of the political prisoners who I most have in my heart,” Ortega Murillo said. Nicaragua has been the stage for a relentless political crackdown since last May, when Ortega and Murillo launched a major offensive against their rivals ahead of last November’s presidential election. Having obliterated Nicaragua’s opposition by jailing dozens of challengers and forcing others into exile, Ortega secured another five-year term. The 76-year-old could now remain in power into his eighties, having governed continuously since being elected in 2006.",News/World news,Legendary Sandinista commander imprisoned as Ortega crushes dissent,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/04/nicaragua-dora-maria-tellez-lesther-aleman-opposition-figures-convicted
2/5/2022,"Einstein once observed that “a scientist is a mimosa when he himself has made a mistake, and a roaring lion when he discovers a mistake of others”. Aside from the “he”, the statement accurately sums up the tone of some of the current scientific discourse on Covid-19. Views on lockdowns, vaccinating children and mask mandates have become increasingly polarised, and social media is unforgiving towards those who voice a change of heart. Yet being proved wrong lies at the heart of scientific progress. In science, an unwillingness to revise your position is normally viewed as an intellectual weakness rather than a sign of moral strength. With this in mind, we asked leading scientists what they got wrong during the pandemic.  Prof Peter Openshaw, theme lead for infection at Imperial College London, did not expect vaccines to be successful As a scientist you relish having your view changed by the facts. That’s different from politics where you’ve occupied a citadel where it’s viewed as a failure if you concede ground. I honestly didn’t think vaccines were going to work. There had been no example of a vaccine for a human coronavirus and the vaccines for animal coronavirus were not that good. We mentioned vaccines in our first report on Covid from Academy of Medical Sciences and said it was unlikely that anything would be available in the near future. So I was completely bowled over when those first trials came through in the run-up to Christmas 2020 and we got this wonderful gift. They were so much more effective than I’d hoped. As a person who has been studying immunity to viruses for 30 years, I should have been able to predict that, if anyone could. Hats off the to the Oxford team, they’re fantastic people and came up trumps. Prof Allyson Pollock, professor of public health at Newcastle University, regrets not speaking out against school closures We knew almost right away, when the blanket lockdown was introduced in March 2020, that children were the least at-risk group, and their education should have been preserved. I wish I’d voiced this more strongly. There were some areas of the country that had almost no cases, and it should have been possible to put in place a cordon sanitaire around remote and rural areas such as the Orkney islands. On schools, closures should have been no more than a few weeks. I was dismayed at the position adopted by the teaching unions. There was a lot of fear and emotion, but they weren’t looking at the evidence or the circumstances that some of these kids were living in, for whom school is a place of safety as well as education. The government could have put in place systems for alternate school days or expanding classroom facilities and recruitment of volunteer staff, but they should have done everything to keep schools open for children. The second round of school closures was a disaster for children. I did speak out early in the first lockdown against banning relatives from nursing homes and the need to redeploy staff to homes, in an editorial in the BMJ. It was really difficult to speak out because it was too politicised. That politicisation was totally wrong in my mind. Dr Kit Yates, director of the Centre for Mathematical Biology at the University of Bath, had a U-turn on the role of scientists in the pandemic I initially saw my role, in TV and radio interviews, as explaining the possibilities and limitations of mathematical modelling and key ideas such as exponential growth and the reproduction number. I had vehement arguments on Twitter, defending the role of the scientists who stood beside ministers at press conferences seeming to legitimise the government’s approach. Although I didn’t agree with some of the policies, I didn’t feel it was the place of those scientists to speak out against them. In hindsight, this was naive. Slowly the questions I was being asked in interviews began to change. After an initial look at the data, questions such as “So what should we be doing differently?” or “Have the government got it wrong on this?” were being fired at me. I realised that I had to come off the fence and give answers. I also joined the Independent Sage group of scientists, a cross-disciplinary group of experts, who provide independent policy advice. The experience has radically changed my view on the role of scientists speaking out and advocating for policy. It is not always enough to let the data speak for themselves. Prof Susan Michie, director of the Centre for Behaviour Change at University College London, changed her mind on the usefulness of masks Early on, my reading was that the evidence on the effectiveness of face masks in community settings was equivocal. The emphasis on droplet transmission raised a concern that infected people may touch their face masks and then touch surfaces, thus providing a transmission route. The possibility of people behaving less cautiously as result of wearing face masks was also raised. Two things changed. When evidence showed that the major route for transmission was via aerosol rather than droplet, the case for masks became hugely stronger. There was also persuasive evidence from real-world studies, including one from German towns and one on cruise ships. This changed my mind from sitting on the fence to being strongly in favour of masks. I was asked on a TV programme how long we’ll be wearing masks. I said “for ever, to some extent”, and was cut off before I could elaborate that this would depend on the context and risk of infection. I had months of being trolled and attacked for saying this. But science continues to generate good evidence that masks reduce infection for Covid-19, an airborne virus. Prof Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, thought British society would accept more intrusive surveillance I think I underplayed the societal differences between South Korea and the UK, including the willingness of publics to be under different levels of surveillance and scrutiny. South Koreans exchanged their privacy, through intense contact tracing with credit cards and phone GPS details, for the ability to continue to move about and continue with daily life, largely. I thought British people would prefer that to full lockdown at home. But I think that such privacy “intrusions” wouldn’t be seen as acceptable to the public here, after observing the pandemic now for two years. Prof Neil Ferguson, epidemiologist at Imperial College London, highlights three things he called wrong First, we all underestimated what proportion of Covid infections being imported into the country were being missed by testing of travellers back in February/March 2020. We estimated it was around 70%, while retrospective analysis indicates that over 90% were missed. So it was only when systematic testing in hospitals started from 10 March that we realised quite how far the epidemic had got. Second, while I was expecting the virus to evolve, the extent of evolution seen when Alpha first arose, together with how much the transmissibility (and, to a lesser extent, severity) increased was a surprise. Last, as immunity has grown in the population (due to infection and vaccination) in the last year, social distancing measures have been relaxed and new variants have emerged, predicting the future course of the epidemic, even in the short-term, has become even more difficult than I expected it would be. Partly because of the unpredictability of human behaviour, such as the “Euros” effect in June 2021. But also because, while we can generate fairly good estimates of vaccine effectiveness, transmissibility and severity for new variants within a few weeks of their emergence, each of these has associated uncertainties, which combine multiplicatively when making projections of possible future trends. Prof Sir Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, has not changed his mind on boosters – but says this has been misunderstood Several commentators have suggested recently that I am against boosters or that I have changed my mind on boosters. Actually, I haven’t. I have consistently been of the view that first and second doses everywhere should be prioritised over third-dose (or fourth) boosters when there is limited supply. Many more lives would have been saved in 2021 if the available vaccine doses had been distributed more fairly around the world. With limited resources, the scientific case for saving many lives trumps the more marginal gains of improving protection with a booster for those who already have a wall of defence against Covid-19. But that doesn’t mean that I am against boosters, just that I am pro-equity.",News/World news,‘The case for masks became hugely stronger’: scientists admit their Covid mistakes,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/04/i-didnt-think-vaccines-would-work-scientists-admit-their-covid-mistakes
2/5/2022,"Mandy Allwood, who made headlines in 1996 after losing all eight of her babies after a rare octuplets pregnancy, has died of cancer. She was 56. When Allwood was 31 she lost six boys and two girls, sparking an outpouring of grief and emotion from around the world.  Allwood’s loss led to her appearing on Oprah Winfrey’s chatshow and she also met the Princess of Wales for lunch. “She had been struggling with cancer for a while and had an operation before Christmas but told us recently that it had come back,” her friend Mark Beard told the Sun. Beard, a pub landlord in Stratford-upon-Avon, said he and friends intended to raise a glass to in tribute to her. In 1996, Allwood gave birth at 24 weeks – 16 weeks early – over three days and nights, but none of the babies survived. “I cradled each of them for two-and-a-half hours as they died in my arms. It was horrible. Truly horrible,” Allwood said. “When I felt the last one coming, I said: ‘Please, God, let at least one of them live.’” Allwood named her children Kypros, Adam, Martyn, Cassius, Nelson, Donald, Kitali and Layne. At the funeral, pallbearers carried eight small, green-and-white coffins adorned with flowers in a procession through West Norwood cemetery in south London. In 2018, Allwood said she and Princess Diana “talked about her depression and my panic attacks and told me that she had been there too”, she told SWNS. “We spoke about her family and she talked a lot about Charles and Camilla. She had a lovely life.” Allwood went on to have three more children. In 2007, she was charged with drink driving and lost custody, later becoming estranged from her family.",News/UK news,"Mandy Allwood, who lost all eight octuplets in 1996, dies of cancer",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/04/mandy-allwood-lost-all-eight-octuplets-1996-dies-cancer
2/5/2022,"More than one in eight primary schoolchildren in England were infected with Covid during the last week of January, the highest prevalence for any age group at any stage during the pandemic. Figures released on Friday by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggest that infections have now peaked among primary schoolchildren, but the surge is continuing to cause significant disruption with large numbers of children absent from school due to positive tests.  The peak in infections comes as the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is expected to make a recommendation as to whether Covid vaccination should be extended to all children aged five or over. This week, the NHS began to roll out vaccines to children aged between five and 11 in the clinically vulnerable category after the JCVI approved the move in December. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, which represents many primary school leaders, said: “The very high rates of infection amongst primary pupils means that the pandemic certainly isn’t over for schools – our members are telling us that disruption due to Covid is as bad as it’s ever been. “There’s a strange disconnect between the lack of mitigations and restrictions, and the lived experiences of families and schools right now,” he added. “Covid is still having a significant impact on education.” Prevalence remains high among secondary pupils, with an infection rate of 7.6% – one in 15 – for those in the school years 7 to 11, the ONS figures showed. This compares with one in 20 people infected in England overall with an estimated 2.6 million infections. Similar rates were seen in Wales, while Scotland recorded Covid-19 infections in one in 30 people and Northern Ireland said one in 15 people were infected. The lowest rates of infections were seen among the over-70s with a rate of just under 2%, the ONS reported. Hospital admissions and the numbers of patients in ICUs with Covid are also falling, government figures show. The ONS latest figures suggest that rates in primary schoolchildren in England have peaked and are beginning to fall. Prof Kevin McConway, an emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University, said: “There’s a small bit of good news about that age group in the daily modelled figures, published today – they show the estimated rate beginning to fall between 26 January and the end of that week on the 29th, though it’s a small fall and that trend is too short-term to be much of a comfort yet.” Speaking to the pandemic response and recovery all-party parliamentary group of MPs earlier this week, Prof Allyson Pollock, of Newcastle University, raised concerns about the continued testing and isolation of schoolchildren. “Healthy children are being tested and isolated unnecessarily,” she said. “Children are at extremely low risk of severe disease and many of them will be asymptomatic or only have mild symptoms.” Others have emphasised arguments for extending vaccinations to younger age groups, as many other countries have already done, and for more focus to be placed on mitigation, including improving ventilation in classrooms. An analysis released on Friday as part of evidence used by the Sage advisory group suggested that Omicron was no more likely to lead to hospital admissions for infants than the Delta variant. Previously, there had been some concern about the apparent increase in the proportion of infants in hospital with Covid-19. However, the latest analysis by the Medical Research Council and the UK Health Security Agency found this could be explained by cases in general being skewed towards younger ages for the Omicron wave. Once this was taken into account, there was found to be no difference in risk of hospital admission between the two variants.",News/World news,"One in eight primary pupils in England had Covid last week, figures show",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/04/one-in-eight-primary-pupils-in-england-had-covid-last-week-figures-show
2/5/2022,"California officials released more information on the violent confrontation at Los Angeles’ SoFi stadium that landed a San Francisco 49ers fan in the hospital. Daniel Luna, 40, fell after he was punched during a confrontation in the parking lot of the stadium after the NFC championship between the Rams and the 49ers on Sunday, the mayor of Inglewood said Thursday.  Luna remained in a medically induced coma while police sought his attacker based on a blurry video and the license plate of a car, the Mayor, James T Butts Jr, said at a news conference. Luna, who owns a restaurant in Oakland, was mingling in a crowd of about 16 people at SoFi stadium, most of them wearing what appeared to be 49ers jerseys, when he pushed a man wearing a Rams jersey from behind, Butts said after viewing the video. Before that, Butts said, “there didn’t seem to be any hostilities”. When Luna turned to walk away, the man pushed Luna back, the mayor said. When Luna turned, the man punched him in the mouth, causing Luna to fall to the ground and hit the back of his head, Butts said, estimating that the encounter lasted less than five seconds. “It looked like a small altercation that went very bad,” he said. “From one punch and someone falling, hitting their head on the ground. It wasn’t like you had people ganging up on somebody and beating them.” Luna’s face was fractured and he was placed in a medically induced coma to prevent internal bleeding from swelling his brain, Butts said. The mayor said the video isn’t clear enough to provide a description of the suspect but he was seen talking to some people in a car. Police want to find the car and talk to the occupants to see if they were involved, Butts said. Security won’t be increased because of the incident, the mayor said. “I’m very comfortable there was sufficient security” in the parking lot, he said. “There is plenty of security in the parking lot. You’re not going to stop every altercation, argument between fans. It’s just not going to happen.“ Next week, the Rams will welcome the Cincinnati Bengals for Super Bowl 56 at the SoFi stadium.",Sport/Football,‘A small altercation that went very bad’: 49ers fan in a medically induced coma,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/04/49ers-fan-medically-induced-coma
2/5/2022,"Alex Greenwood is in the grip of an addiction she never wants to kick. “I’m obsessed with football,” says the Manchester City and England defender. “Often, at home, all Jack and I talk about is football, we watch it and analyse it all the time. People ask what I do to get away from the game but I don’t want to escape it.” “Jack” is Jack O’Connell, the Sheffield United defender, famed for his ability as an overlapping centre-half, although a serious knee injury dictates that he has spent the past 18 months watching Greenwood perfect her transition from left-back to left-sided centre-half.  “I wouldn’t want to try overlapping though,” jokes the 28-year-old as she prepares for Sunday’s all important Women’s Super League match at Chelsea. “That Sheffield United system was so unique I’m not sure it would be the style for me.” Gareth Taylor’s City play a different way but they, like Sheffield United at their Premier League peak under Chris Wilder, have recently begun blind-siding opponents once more. After recovering from a dismal start to the season, last year’s WSL runners-up travel to face the defending champions only five points behind Emma Hayes’s second-placed side. Fifth is still not where City want to be but, as last weekend’s 8-0 FA Cup demolition of Nottingham Forest emphasised, they are renascent. Given that 12 senior players spent pre-season on international duty at the Tokyo Olympics and an injury crisis engulfed the squad, Greenwood never panicked. “Every time we got a knockback it was tough and frustrating,” says the former Everton, Notts County, Liverpool, Manchester United and Lyon defender. “But, inside the camp, we knew results would improve and we always, absolutely 100%, believed in Gareth. In terms of what we do, not a lot has changed between the start of the season and now. We had the injuries and some new players and it was always going to take time for them to adjust and adapt to the way we play.” Along the way, City coped with the injury-induced absences of England’s goalkeeper, right-back and captain, but the recent return of Ellie Roebuck – a good friend of Greenwood – in goal and Lucy Bronze and Steph Houghton in defence has galvanised both Taylor’s team and one of the most intriguing WSL title races in recent years. After winning four trophies, including the 2020 Champions League, during a season spent at Lyon, Greenwood has no interest in treading water – and particularly not in the year when England hosts the European Championship. Although she remains in regular contact with the former England manager Phil Neville – “A top fella and a good person; it’s always nice to hear from Phil and have some banter about the Manchester clubs,” she says – her disappointment at his relocation to Inter Miami has been leavened by Sarina Wiegman’s installation as the Lionesses’ coach. After leading the Netherlands to Euro 2017 glory then to the final of the 2019 World Cup in France, Wiegman is tasked with improving on England’s run of semi-final appearances at major tournaments. “I love her,” says Greenwood, a Lionesses stalwart since winning a bronze medal at the 2015 World Cup in Canada. “She’s straightforward and quite direct and leaves no stone unturned. We believe in her – Sarina’s very good and what we needed. But she also gives us freedom to be ourselves; she never wants to change who you are.” This month England limber up for the Euros with a friendly tournament, the Arnold Clark Cup, involving Canada, Spain and Germany. O’Connell will doubtless “point little things out” as he assesses Greenwood’s international performances in Middlesbrough, Norwich and Wolverhampton. Yet the day cannot come soon enough when she, too, can offer him the “constructive” footballing criticism the pair have traded since he returned from an expat childhood in Málaga and they met as sixth formers at school on Merseyside. Until the start of last season their parallel careers ran on upward trajectories but, since O’Connell’s injury, there have been two operations and a brief, failed comeback. It cannot have been an easy time and, although Sheffield United remain optimistic he will make a full recovery, Greenwood is protective of his privacy. “Jack hasn’t spoken publicly about his injury,” she says. “So I don’t think it’s right for me to talk about it.” It is, though, safe to assume the day she returns to Bramall Lane to watch him play again will rank among the happiest of their time together. By then Greenwood believes City should be well on course for European qualification. “At times this season it felt like it was the world was against us but we knew it was a matter of time before things changed,” she says. “Everyone wrote us off but we had a belief we could surprise them.” Get to know the players in England’s top flight better with our WSL player in focus series.
