3/12/2022,"Chippendales founder Steve Banerjee subscribed to the old adage that no publicity is bad publicity. When he first established the male striptease shows in 1979 — a novelty at the time — he used every method at his disposal to promote it, according to his former employees and associates featured in A&E's new series Secrets of the Chippendales Murders. Even, or especially, if it meant making his business, which was first run out of a club in Los Angeles, look scandalous. ""In order to get free press, he would call up some of the local churches anonymously and say, you know, I heard that these guys are gonna be dancing over at this place, and they're actually naked,"" former dancer Hodari Sababu says in the first of four episodes. ""You'd have the church ladies [picketing] with their signs, then you'd have the media covering it."" Of course, then Banerjee would be interviewed and deny that nudity was happening. It wasn't. The men wore collars and cuffs inspired by the accessories worn by the famous Playboy bunnies. A vintage news clip shows a male reporter asking him how much do the men take off. ""It comes up to their briefs,"" Banerjee happily explained, ""so we do not have any nudity of any sort. And they all shout 'Take it off, take it off.' And we just tell them, 'No, this is it. That's all we can do.'"" He was having the ""greatest time,"" Sababu says of the revue, which continues to offer performances in Las Vegas — Jersey Shore's Vinny Guagagnino stars this month — and throughout the world. ""It put us on the map."" Bruce Nahin, a former attorney for Banerjee, said he would call the L.A. Fire Department to report overcrowding, even when they weren't. When they were, he'd report that too. In one local news interview, Banerjee is asked, ""What do you think's behind this?"" He answers, ""I wonder. I will definitely talk to the police commission to make sure that I do not violate the law in any way."" Another former dancer, Eddie Prevot, said the free publicity was an essential part of Banerjee's business strategy. ""The state liquor authority in California was coming in to shut it down,"" Prevot explains. ""So now it's hitting the news, and he built his business on negative publicity. They think they're shutting Steve down. They're doing just the opposite."" Still, there actually were things going down at the club that neighbors and church ladies would disapprove of. Sex was happening throughout the club. Even outside of it, one former employee says. In one scene, someone unfortunate enough to live behind that original Chippendales location tells a TV reporter, ""We've had people having sex relations on the lawn."" There was a lot worse than that going on at Chippendales, and Banerjee was behind much of it. He was later convicted of hiring someone to kill his former business partner. He died by suicide in 1994, hours before he was supposed to be sentenced.

3/12/2022,"An individual wanted for hitting an Asian man with a hammer on a Manhattan subway platform has been charged with hate crimes and ordered held on a $300,000 bail on Friday.

Christian Jeffers, who reportedly identifies as a woman, was arrested on Wednesday in connection with the attack, which occurred on the 7th Avenue and West 14th Street station on the 1/2/3 line in Chelsea on Tuesday night.

Jeffers, 48, and the unidentified victim, 29, reportedly bumped into each other and got into an argument. Jeffers, who became “irate and aggressive,” then pulled out a hammer and struck the victim’s head, police said.

Authorities charged Jeffers with assault, aggravated harassment and menacing, which were all classified as hate crimes. She was also charged with criminal possession of a weapon.

According to a criminal complaint, during her arrest she used racial slurs against an officer and threatened them, “By the time I get out of prison, first thing I’m going to do is get a gun and try to kill as many of you as possible.”

Police sources described Jeffers as a “transit offender” with 47 prior arrests. Her rap sheet reportedly dates back to 2007 and includes charges of drug possession, grand larceny, prostitution, public lewdness and theft of service.

Last June, she completed a nearly six-year prison sentence for a second-degree robbery conviction. She is still on supervised release for that case, which is set to expire in September 2024.

It’s unclear what exactly led to her hate crime charges. Speaking to NBC New York on Wednesday, the victim accused Jeffers of intentionally bumping into him after harassing someone else.

“He [sic] turned around, trying to get in my face, get in my face aggressively,” the victim told the outlet. He then recalled Jeffers as saying, “Don't you see me walking here? Don't you have eyes? Open your eyes!”



The victim was taken to Bellevue Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. He is now understood to be in recovery.

The incident adds to the series of violent attacks against Asian Americans in New York City, particularly on subway stations. Since the fatal shoving of Michelle Go, calls for heightened security measures have intensified, prompting Mayor Eric Adams to announce a ”Subway Safety Plan” and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to test platform barriers by 2024.

The fact that Jeffers is a repeat offender — similar to suspects accused in the murders of Go and Christina Yuna Lee — also raises concerns on local criminal justice policies, which may become more lenient with the creation of a new anti-incarceration division under the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office. However, the office pointed out that incarceration “will continue to be an available outcome for the most serious offenses, particularly for those who commit violent crimes.”

A judge reportedly set Jeffers’ bail to $300,000. It’s unclear whether the 48-year-old has hired an attorney.

3/12/2022,"Ukraine's Ministry of Defense released a video of strikes on vehicles outside of Kyiv. The aerial footage, dated March 8, shows at least eight strikes outside the town of Borodyanka. Borodyanka is about 45 miles from the center of Kyiv, and has been the scene of fierce fighting. A video released Thursday by the Ukrainian military showed strikes on what officials said was a line of Russian military vehicles not far from Kyiv. The aerial footage appears to have been recorded at a distance by a drone. It shows at least eight strikes on vehicles on a rural road identified by the Ukrainian defense ministry as being outside the town of Borodyanka. The video, dated to Tuesday, was posted on Facebook and Twitter on Thursday to channels run by the Ukrainian armed forces. The footage pauses at the moment of a burst of fire on the central vehicle in a line of three — either tanks or other self-propelled artillery. Then the other two appear to be picked off. Further strikes follow. Ukraine's Ministry of Defense described it as artillery fire, but the strikes appear to be guided munitions like an anti-tank missile fired by a soldier, or perhaps from a drone. Insider used geolocation to identify the likely location of the strikes. Satellite imagery showed a distinctive road formation and gas station that matched the aerial footage. Lt. Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, commander in chief of Ukraine's army, described the operation as ""delicate,"" according to the defense ministry. It is a distinction Ukrainian forces might be keen to emphasize in the face of shelling from Russian forces that has hit residential buildings, schools, and hospitals. That includes Borodyanka, which is about 45 miles from the center of Kyiv and has been a scene of some of the fiercest fighting around the capital. The town of about 13,000 was bombarded in the Russian advance. On March 3, drone footage emerged of the town's devastation, showing the still-smoking remains of apartment buildings. Local media reported that one of the places hit was a veterans' rehabilitation center, according to the Kyiv Independent. A Pentagon assessment of Russian advances on Kyiv from Tuesday said that a major column of Russian forces in the region remained. ""Near Kyiv, we still observe that Russian forces have not moved closer to the city center,"" a Defense Department official said. ""The closest they've been able to get is the airport."" In briefings on Tuesday and Wednesday, a Pentagon official said that about 90 to 95% of Russian combat power remains intact, despite fierce resistance from Ukraine and widespread video and photo evidence of destroyed Russian forces.* Editor's note: An earlier version of this article described the strikes as being from artillery, on the basis of a description from Ukraine's Ministry of Defense. Closer analysis of the footage concluded this was unlikely.

3/12/2022,"Russia has confirmed it used a deadly 'lung-busting' thermobaric bomb in Ukraine. It is believed the weapon - often called a vacuum bomb - was used in the Chernihiv region, 80 miles north of Kyiv. The area has been under fire for weeks and dozens of civilian deaths have been confirmed. The UK Ministry of Defence says their use is not illegal but they are heavily regulated. The weapons suck in oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a high-temperature explosion. They typically produce a blast wave that lasts significantly longer than that of a conventional explosive and are capable of vapourising human bodies. In warfare, they are often used in so-called ‘bunker buster’ roles, or to attack caves or tunnel systems. The term thermobaric comes from the Greek ‘therme’ and ‘baros’ meaning ‘heat’ and ‘pressure’. The MoD said they had been launched in Ukraine from a TOS-1A rocket launcher. Read more: How to help Ukraine: 9 ways you can make a difference from the UK The bombs detonate in two stages: first, fuel or dust-like material is dispersed into the air, forming a cloud. Then the cloud is detonated to create an incredibly powerful shock wave. The CIA says that such weapons can ‘obliterate’ people near the explosion and do significant damage to buildings. A CIA report says: “Those at the fringe are likely to suffer many internal, thus invisible injuries, including burst eardrums and crushed inner ear organs, severe concussions, ruptured lungs and internal organs, and possibly blindness.” Dr Patricia Lewis, Research Director for International Security at Chatham House, told LBC that the wide area of the ignited particles make them 'suck in' oxygen in the first stage of the blast. The blast from a thermobaric bomb is 'very sustained', Dr Lewis explains, and the weapons have become deadlier as the technology has developed. The weapons were first developed in the 1960s by both the USA and the Soviet Union, and have been widely used in Afghanistan. They are not illegal but they cannot be used against military targets in a way that may endanger the civilian population, or in a way that the damage they caused would be excessive to the military advantage gained. Purposefully using it against civilians is illegal.

3/12/2022,"By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON (Reuters) -Confiscating the assets of companies that have fled Russia since the invasion of Ukraine would shatter investor confidence for decades and take Russia back to the calamitous days of the 1917 Bolshevik revolution, metals magnate Vladimir Potanin has said. Potanin, president and biggest shareholder of Norilsk Nickel, the world's largest producer of palladium and refined nickel, said Russia should respond with pragmatism to its exclusion from swathes of the global economy. ""We should not try to 'slam the door' but endeavour to preserve Russia's economic position in those markets which we spent so long cultivating,"" Potanin, 61, said on the Telegram messaging app. Potanin, one of the most prominent Russian billionaires who is not sanctioned by the West, said confiscating assets from companies that had left would put Russia out in the cold for decades, as far as investors were concerned: ""It would take us back 100 years to 1917. And the consequences - a global lack of confidence in Russia from investors - we would feel for many decades."" Russia's economy is facing the gravest crisis since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union after the West imposed sweeping sanctions across Russia's financial and corporate sectors following Moscow's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said on Thursday that the government proposed putting companies that had left Russia into external administration. The exact mechanisms of that are unclear, though there is a fierce debate within the Russian elite about how severe Moscow's reaction to Western sanctions should be, officials and businessmen said. Putin said Russia would remain open for business and did not intend to close itself off from those who still wanted to do business. But many do not - at least for now. BP said last month it was abandoning its stake in Russian oil producer Rosneft while companies ranging from McDonald's and Coca-Cola Co to Toyota and IKEA have shuttered their businesses in Russia. 'WE MUST BE WISER' Potanin’s upbringing as the son of a high-ranking Soviet trade official and an education at Moscow’s elite diplomatic academy have always set him slightly apart from other oligarchs who rose from rags to riches in the chaos of the 1990s. The privatisation deals under President Boris Yeltsin gave Potanin and other oligarchs control over some of the best assets of a former superpower, though their clout was eroded under Putin as a new group of former spies put some of Russia's biggest oil production units under state control. Besides being the world's largest producer of palladium and high-grade nickel, MMC Norilsk Nickel is a major producer of platinum and copper. It also produces cobalt, rhodium, silver, gold, iridium, ruthenium, selenium, tellurium and sulphur. Potanin said some countries used sanctions as a way to edge out competition, urging Moscow to consider its moves carefully. He also urged Moscow to remove restrictions on servicing Russia's foreign currency debt, which he said totalled $480 billion. He said a technical default on interest payments could trigger demands for the full principal to be paid. ""This fully applies to major public companies,"" Potanin said. Russia said on Sunday that sovereign bond payments will depend on sanctions. ""We see that the West's own economies have suffered by imposing sanctions against Russia. So we must be wiser and avoid a scenario under which our sanctions hit us,"" Potanin said. Putin says the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is essential to ensure Russian security after NATO admitted members up to Russia's borders and Western countries supported pro-Western leaders in Kyiv. Ukraine says it is fighting for its existence and the United States and its European and Asian allies have condemned the Russian invasion. China has called for calm.

3/12/2022,"Mila Kunis is opening up about the emotional toll recent events in Ukraine have taken on her. In a candid interview with Maria Shriver, the actress and activist spoke at length about the newfound pride she’s gained as a Ukrainian immigrant herself, why she’s making it a point to tell her kids they’re “half Ukrainian and half American” and why it’s important for Americans to separate the Russian people from those in power. “I was born in Ukraine. I came to the States in 1991 and we were the last of my family to migrate,” Kunis explains, adding that she was about 8 years old at the time. ""I very much have always felt like an American,” she continued, saying that growing up, “People were like, 'Oh, you're so Eastern European.' I was like, 'I'm so LA!’ What do you mean? Like, my whole life I was like ‘I am LA through and through.’” That all changed when Russia invaded Ukraine last month — an event Kunis says has changed how she embraces her Ukrainian identity. “[Russia’s invasion] happens and I can't express or explain what came over me, but all of a sudden I was like, 'Oh my God, I feel like a part of my heart just got ripped out,’” she explained. “It was the weirdest feeling.” That mindset extended to how she's explaining the situation with her children, daughter Wyatt, 7, and son Dimitri, 5, both of whom she shares with Ashton Kutcher. Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis are halfway to their goal of raising $30 million for the people of Ukraine. The Ukrainian-born Kunis emigrated to the United States in 1991. “It doesn’t take away from who I am as a person but it just adds an entire different layer,” she explains. ""I turned to my kids and I was like, 'You are half Ukrainian, half American!' Like, I literally was like, 'Look, you!” And my kids were like, 'Yeah mom, I get it.' And I was like, 'No! You are Ukrainian and American.' I was like, 'You are half Iowa, half Ukraine.' And they're like, 'Okay, I get it.’” “It's been irrelevant to me that I come from Ukraine. It never mattered,” she explained of her upbringing. “So much so that I've always said I'm Russian. Like I've always been, 'I'm from Russia' for a multitude of reasons. One of them being when I came to the States and I would tell people I’m from from Ukraine, the first question I’d get was ‘Where is Ukraine?’ And then I’d have to explain Ukraine and where it is on the map… But if I was like, ‘I’m from Russia’ people were like, ‘Oh we know that country.’ So I was like great I’ll just tell people from Russia.” “Hell no! I’m from Ukraine. Everything’s changed,” she says now. “It is a sense of pride, and it’s not taking away from loving where I live now and everything that this country has given me.” As far as Kunis’s message to the American people, one of the biggest points she wanted get across was to implore people to understand the difference between the Russian people and the Russian leaders. ""I don't think that we need to consider the people of Russia an enemy,” she explained. “I do really want to emphasize that. I don't think that that's being said enough in the press. I think that there's now, 'If you're not with us, you're against us' mentality. And I don't want people to conflate the two problems that are happening. I don't think it's the people of Russia … I do encourage people to look at it from the perspective of, 'It's the people in power, not the people themselves.’” ""I also don't want people to get discouraged and conflate different issues in the world, and I don't want people to compare,” she added. “I think that one thing that's happening a little bit that I've noticed is people are like, 'Why is everybody paying attention to this problem, but nobody paid attention to all these other issues that have been happening?' And I don't want people to conflate.” “Like everyone,” she concluded. “People just [need] to focus on what is at hand right now and right now this issue can get incredibly catastrophic for the rest of the world, not just for that part of the world, and I don't want people to lose sight of that."" Kunis and Kutcher have been putting their money and time where their mouth is. The couple recently hit a big milestone in their fundraising effort for Ukraine, raising $20 million in less than a week — just shy of $10 million from their original goal of $30 million, which they're confident they'll achieve sooner rather than later. ""Our goal's $30 [million] and we're gonna get there,"" Kutcher said in an update this week. ""But we do want to say thank you to the 56,000 of you who were able to donate and supported us. Whether it was the $5, $10, $1000, whatever it was, means so much to us because it does bring in a community and a sense of belonging and an ability to help,"" Kunis added. Their funds benefits Flexport and Airbnb, two organizations who are ""actively on the ground providing immediate help to those who need it most,"" Kunis said. ""There have been over 1 million children — this is just children — that are in refugee status right now,"" Kutcher added. ""Every bit we can do helps and we appreciate you.""

3/12/2022,"By Mark Trevelyan LONDON (Reuters) - Russia shifted its stance over the bombing of a Ukrainian hospital in the city of Mariupol, with a mix of statements on Thursday that veered between aggressive denials and a call by the Kremlin to establish clear facts. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said three people including a child had been killed in the bombing on Wednesday, and rejected Russian assertions there had been no patients there. ""Like always, they lie confidently,"" said Zelenskiy, who has accused Moscow of waging genocide in the war it launched two weeks ago. In the face of worldwide condemnation there were rare signs of inconsistency in the response from Russian officials, who since the start of Moscow's invasion on Feb. 24 have stuck tightly to the same narrative for what Russia calls its special military operation in Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, asked for comment in the immediate aftermath, told Reuters on Wednesday: ""Russian forces do not fire on civilian targets."" On Thursday he said the Kremlin would look into the incident. ""We will definitely ask our military, because you and I don't have clear information about what happened there,"" Peskov told reporters. ""And the military are very likely to provide some information."" 'INFORMATION TERRORISM' Other Russian officials took a more aggressive line, rejecting the hospital bombing as fake news. ""This is information terrorism,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. The Defence Ministry later denied having bombed the hospital, accusing Ukraine of staging the incident. It said Russian forces at the time had been respecting an agreement to hold fire to allow the evacuation of civilians. ""Russian aviation carried out absolutely no strikes on ground targets in the area,"" spokesman Igor Konashenkov said. ""The alleged air strike was completely a staged provocation... that can deceive the Western public but not an expert."" Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov attacked what he called ""pathetic shouting about so-called atrocities by the Russian armed forces"". He told reporters after meeting Ukraine's foreign minister in Turkey that the hospital building had for days been under the control of ultra-radical Ukrainian forces who had emptied out the doctors and patients - the version rejected by Zelenskiy as a lie. Moscow says it is conducting a special military operation to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Kyiv and the West reject these as false pretexts for an invasion of a democratic country of 44 million people. On Wednesday, the United States denied renewed Russian accusations that Washington was operating biowarfare labs in Ukraine, calling the claims ""laughable"".

3/12/2022,"Elon Musk has caused a stir online after posting about a Satoshi Nakamoto conspiracy theory, reigniting speculations on the true identity of the mysterious Bitcoin developer.

In a tweet on Wednesday, Musk shared an image suggesting that the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto is simply an amalgam of syllables from the brand names of four electronics companies: “Sa” from Samsung, “Toshi” from Toshiba, “Naka” from Nakamichi and “Moto” from Motorola.

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 9, 2022 


While several people have claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the developer’s identity has never been officially confirmed. The Bitcoin creator reportedly began writing its code in 2007 and was active in its development until early 2011.

The theory that the four aforementioned companies are collectively behind the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, however, is not new. The image Musk recently posted has been shared on Twitter for years now, while a Reddit user claimed in a 2017 thread that the conspiracy, which went “mainstream,” was posted “years ago.”

Musk, a cryptocurrency advocate himself, has been rumored to be Satoshi Nakamoto since 2017, supported by suspicions that the Bitcoin developer may not be Japanese after all. However, Musk has denied these allegations.
 
 Not true. A friend sent me part of a BTC a few years, but I don’t know where it is. 
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 28, 2017 


While most individuals suspected of being Satoshi Nakamoto also deny the allegations, Craig Wright, an Australian computer scientist, claimed the identity years ago. In a 2016 blog post, he reportedly wrote that he was the real Satoshi Nakamoto and that he had evidence to back up his claim.

Several people, including Musk himself, consider computer scientist Nick Szabo to be the real Satoshi Nakamoto. Prior to Wednesday’s tweet, Musk described Szabo in an episode of “The Lex Fridman Podcast” from last December as “more responsible for the ideas behind Bitcoin than anyone else.”

“You can look at the evolution of ideas before the launch of Bitcoin and see who wrote about those ideas,” the Neuralink co-founder told Fridman. “Obviously, I don’t know who created Bitcoin for practical purposes, but the evolution of ideas is pretty clear before that. It seems as though Nick Szabo is probably, more than anybody else, responsible for the evolution of those ideas.”

 As Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity could well remain a mystery for all eternity, the internet is unlikely to run out of speculations.

3/12/2022,"A senior Ukrainian official said that Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday that he should take Russian President Vladimir Putin’s proposal for ending the war. An official in the Israeli Prime Minster's Office denies the claim. Why it matters: Bennett has emerged as a key mediator between Putin and Zelensky in the last two weeks. Israel has said it needs to remain neutral in the mediation, but the Ukrainian official told Axios that Bennett must present proposals and do more than act as a ""mailbox"" between the two sides. Get market news worthy of your time with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free. Driving the news: The senior Ukrainian official claimed Bennett initiated the call on Tuesday and recommended Zelensky take the offer. Zelensky and his advisers didn’t like Bennett’s recommendation, according to the Ukrainian official. ""Bennett is basically telling us to surrender and we have no intention of doing that,"" the senior Ukrainian official said. A senior official in the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said that the details of the call as described the Ukrainian official were not true. “We doubt that the official is a senior person that is in Ukraine now and who was on the call, because it was conducted on a private line. Our contacts are directly with President Zelensky and his close advisers,"" the official in the Prime Minister’s Office said. The Israeli official said Bennett didn’t recommend that Zelensky take Putin’s offer because Israel hasn’t received such an offer. “The prime minister doesn’t intend to give Zelensky any recommendations or advice at any stage,"" the official said. The Israeli official stressed the call between Zelensky and Bennett was good and long and included a discussion about the possibility of holding a mediation meeting in Jerusalem. The Israeli official declined to comment on whether Israel is going to propose a more detailed plan for ending the war. “The prime minister’s efforts are focused on one thing — stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine,"" the official said. Behind the scenes: In the last two weeks — and especially after Bennett’s trip to Moscow last Saturday — the Israeli government has claimed that it needs to maintain a careful and balanced approach to the war in Ukraine. The Israelis asked Ukraine in private to stop requesting military assistance or political backing from Israel because it will harm the mediation efforts that demand neutrality, the senior Ukrainian official said. Details: The senior Ukrainian official said Zelensky and his aides didn’t get the impression over the last week that Bennett’s mediation efforts are bearing any fruit. The government in Kyiv thinks Bennett has not been acting as a mediator, the senior Ukrainian official said. He added that a mediator needs to push for compromises, put proposals on the table and not simply pass messages. “We don’t need another mailbox, we have enough of those,"" the Ukrainian official said. The official added that Zelensky and his advisers believe that if Bennett wants to stay neutral and mediate, he needs to appoint an envoy that will work on this full time. Between the lines: The Ukrainian president and his aides think that Bennett’s diplomatic involvement is largely motivated by his goal of not taking a clear position on the Russian invasion in order to maintain good relations with Russia, according to the Ukrainian official. “His initiative looks like an excuse for why he is not speaking out against Russia, not providing weapons to Ukraine and not sanctioning Russia,"" the Ukrainian official said. The official noted that France and Germany are also passing messages between Kyiv and Moscow and don’t claim they have to stay neutral. Like this article?

3/12/2022,"A picture purported to be of a fighter pilot apparently responsible for shooting down multiple Russian jets has been shared by Ukraine’s armed forces. The image shows a pilot - who has become known as the 'Ghost of Kyiv' - with their visor and oxygen mask sat in the cockpit of a MiG-29 fighter jet, pointing at the missiles loaded on the bottom of the wings. It is captioned with the words: ""Hello, occupier, I’m coming for your soul!” Reports of the ""Ghost"" have spread since Vladimir Putin began invading Ukraine two weeks ago. It is said the single fighter pilot is responsible for downing 10 Russian aircraft, an incredible feat by one person. The existence of the Ghost is disputed, with many arguing they are simply a myth or used as a term to describe the whole of the Russian Airforce. Whether real or fake, the rumour has bolstered the fighting spirit of a country which has so far been subjected to brutal attacks on heavily populated cities. The invasion has caused the biggest humanitarian crisis since World War Two - with over 2.5 million refugees fleeing Ukraine to neighbouring countries. Ukraine's ability to keep flying air force jets is a visible demonstration of the country's resilience in the face of attack and has been a morale booster, both to its own military and Ukraine's people, experts have said. Russia had by far the superior air force at the start of the invasion, but has yet to achieve control over the skies. Ukrainian armed forces have regularly posted pictures and videos of downed Russian aircraft, claiming to have downed 57 planes so far. However, their alleged success in shooting down planes has not stop the constant bombardment of cities across the country. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly asked his Western allies for a no-fly zone to be enforced over his country - calls which have so far been denied. Since then, in an apparent attempt at compromise, Zelenskyy has also called on the US to provide more warplanes so Ukraine could better defend itself. Calls for support were once again renewed on Wednesday after Russia was accused of bombing a maternity hospital in Mariupol, which Ukrainian authorities said killed three people including a child. Speaking on Thursday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said bringing in the no-fly zone would cause direct conflict between Russia and Nato. Johnson said that while Vladimir Putin had abandoned “all norms of civilised behaviour”, conflict with Russia was something he was determined to avoid. Speaking on Sky New’s Beth Rigby Interviews, he acknowledged that some of his conversations with Mr Zelensky had been “deeply upsetting” as the Ukrainian leader appealed for more help. “What’s happened in Mariupol in that maternity hospital really shows that Putin is prepared just to reject, to abandon, all norms of civilised behaviour,” he said. Watch: Boris Johnson says it is ""deeply unsettling"" to refuse Ukraine's calls for a no-fly zone  “The difficulty is that there is a line beyond which, quite frankly, the UK and Nato would be deemed to be in conflict – direct conflict – with Russia. “It’s agonising. It’s absolutely agonising. And I’ve had this conversation at least a couple of times now with Volodymyr, but I think the difficulty is that it will require me to order RAF jets, UK pilots into the air with a mission to shoot down Russian fast jets. “I think we’ve got to be realistic… there’s a line that is very difficult to cross.” It comes amid reports that Russia is ""re-posturing"" for a renewed attack after failing to take control of Ukraine after coming up against fierce resistance.",News/Yahoo News UK,The Ghost of Kyiv: Ukraine shares picture of 'mythical' fighter pilot,https://news.yahoo.com/the-ghost-of-kyiv-ukraine-shares-picture-of-mythical-fighter-pilot-173834329.html
3/12/2022,"Abramovich's two superyachts are moving eastward after he was sanctioned. It's unclear where Solaris and Eclipse, worth a total of more than $1 billion, are sailing. Abramovich's assets were frozen on Thursday as a part of UK sanctions. Two superyachts belonging to Roman Abramovich are heading east after the UK hit the billionaire Russian oligarch with sanctions on Thursday. Among the sanctions imposed on Abramovich, the UK government said, was the freezing of his assets, meaning his yachts and private jets are at risk of seizure. Abramovich's 460-foot vessel, Solaris, was just off the east coast of Italy on Friday, according to the ship-tracking site MarineTraffic. It had left a shipyard in Barcelona, Spain, on Tuesday, where it had been docked since late 2021 for repairs, Reuters reported. It's unclear where Solaris is sailing. MarineTraffic says the destination of its port isn't recognized. Solaris has a price tag of $600 million, according to SuperYacht Fan. Meanwhile, Abramovich's 533-foot yacht, Eclipse, has been cruising eastward from St. Martin in the Caribbean since February 21, MarineTraffic data shows. The boat, which costs $700 million according to SuperYacht Fan, was near the west coast of Africa on Friday, MarineTraffic said. There is also no destination port for Eclipse listed on MarineTraffic's website, so it's unclear where the superyacht is going to dock next. After the invasion of Ukraine, sanctioned Russian oligarchs such as Abramovich have sought to move their yachts and private jets across the world in an attempt to protect their assets. Abramovich, who Bloomberg estimates has a net worth of $13.7 billion, is the owner of Chelsea FC. He had announced last week that he was selling the club, but the UK's sanctions mean he can't go ahead with the sale.

3/12/2022,"A Georgia teacher has been suspended after an altercation with a student who brought a gun to school in August 2021. The disciplinary action stems from when former Coach Kenneth Miller said he received a video showing guns on Tri-Cities High School grounds, in East Point, according to WSB. On their way to an outdoor pep rally that day, the school officials got notice that students were “planning on doing something,” Miller told Fox News. He said the school’s principal asked him to investigate reports that students had brought guns to campus, the outlet reported. The teacher’s attorney, Allen Lightcap, said that Miller was asking the student where the guns were when she attacked him. Shortly after the altercation, he said Miller found the gun she brought. Video from an officer’s body cam shows that when he went to the student to confront her, the student was agitated and smacked Miller’s hand. He proceeded to push the student against the wall and restrained her until police intervened. “Coach Miller is the reason all of metro Atlanta does not know the date of August 20, 2021,” Lightcap told McClatchy News in a statement. “That’s because he averted another tragic school shooting that day, and no one was hurt. Everyone went home safe. Coach Miller is the reason these guns were found.” After the incident, Fulton County School District originally filed a termination charge against Miller, Lightcap said. The Fulton County school district told McClatchy News in a statement that Miller “failed to meet the professional expectations it has for employees.” “Mr. Miller acted outside of the scope of his authority and responsibilities,” the statement read. “Mr. Miller’s conduct resulted in an escalation of a physical altercation with a student in crisis, which conflicts with district expectations to deescalate in these types of situations.” The teacher’s attorney said his client had “the right to self defense” in this incident. “This is especially true when guns are involved,” Lightcap said in the statement. “Teachers should not be terminated or suspended when it’s clear they were defending themselves.” District officials scheduled a termination hearing in the case. But Lightcap said the hearing was then “abruptly canceled by the District without Coach Miller’s consent.” “Now that the district has changed its charge to a suspension mid-trial, Coach Miller no longer gets to call witnesses so that the truth can come out,” Lightcap said. In a letter from Ethel Lett, the high school’s principal, shared on the school’s website, Lett said that “bringing a gun or weapon onto a school campus” is a “very serious offense,” in “clear violation of our Fulton County Schools’ Student Code of Conduct.” In the letter, the principal announced that the school is exploring steps such as unannounced K-9 dog sweeps and random weapons checks. Miller received the notice of suspension on March 4. On March 9, Lightcap appealed the 20-day suspension, according to legal documents. In the appeal, Lightcap reiterated that Miller “did nothing wrong” and that he “defended himself against a student who attacked him.” “[Officer] Cleveland and [AP] Lawson corroborated Miller’s account that [the student] was the aggressor, was highly agitated, and smacked the phone out of Miller’s hand,” the Personal Investigation Report made on Sept. 13, 2021 said, according to Lightcap. Lightcap wrote in the appeal that the investigation report said all three eye witnesses said they did not witness any misconduct by Miller. But, the attorney added that Fulton Board policies “specifically exclude witness testimony” when it comes to suspensions versus full terminations. “Coach Miller asks that the Fulton County drop the suspension and put him back to work at Tri-Cities,” Lightcap said, “It is never too late to do the right thing.” Teacher caught using racial slur on video is teaching again in North Carolina Teacher suspended after parents said he taught ‘Russian propaganda’ to Virginia class High school teacher shown in video slapping student is now arrested, Indiana cops say Parent assaulted school resource officer, then drove away, North Carolina cops say",U.S./Macon Telegraph,"Teacher suspended after restraining armed student at Georgia high school, lawyer says",https://news.yahoo.com/teacher-suspended-restraining-armed-student-164158446.html

3/12/2022,"The war in Ukraine has been a been marked by a strong resistance which it is believes the Russians did not anticipate and has left Vladimir Putin frustrated and angry. The war effort has seen civilians take up arms against Russian troops, while the country has also been supplied with a significant amount of weapons from the West. One of the most important aspects of this has been the thousands of anti-tank weapons that have poured into the country, but what are they and have they made a difference? Numerous allies - including the UK, Germany, France, US and Denmark - have supplied Ukraine with anti-tank weapons since the start of the conflict. Each missile costs around £130,000, but that is nowhere near as expensive as the tanks they are fired at. Numerous different types of anti-tank weapons have been handed to Kyiv, including Javelins and Next Generation Light Antitank Weapons (NLAWs). Read more: Russia falsely claims pregnant beauty blogger caught up in hospital bombing is faking injuries with make-up Generally, the Americans have been supplying Javelins, while the Europeans have been providing NLAWs. They are significantly more advanced than the basic RPGs the Ukrainians were equipped with in 2014. The basic premise of a modern anti-tank weapon is a small guided missile held by a single-use launcher. The launcher has an advanced targeting computer attached to it and targets specific weak spots on tanks. The computer does 95% of the work for the soldier, meaning all they have to do is pull the trigger and then get into cover. Watch: Ukraine war: Drone footage shows Russian tank column retreat after artillery ambush Drone footage shows a Russian tank column coming under fire on the outskirts of Kyiv. The weak spot is usually the turret or the area between the turret and the main body of the tank. The armour-piercing missile usually completely disables a tank with a single shot. Javelin missiles fire straight up into the air before arcing back down to hit the top of the tank and have a much longer range than NLAWs (4.5km compare to 1km). They weigh around 12kg, which is carriable for a single soldier, but once the missile has been fired, the huge launcher is then useless.

With the fact they can be operated by one or two soldiers they have significantly advanced ground combat, making tanks' previous dominance much reduced. Although hard facts are difficult to confirm in such a fluid situation, it appears the supply of anti-tank weapons to Ukraine has caused significant damage to the Russian advance. Numerous videos of the targeted missiles being shot at Russian armour have appeared on social media. Even more pictures of destroyed tanks have circulated around the internet. Russia has the largest number of tanks in the world, although many of these are fairly old Soviet models. Ukraine claims to have destroyed 465 heavy vehicles (tanks, armoured fighting vehicles, infantry fighting vehicles, armoured personnel carriers) since the start of fighting. Although the Russians are losing lots of armour, videos in recent days appear to show them employing weapons to counter anti-tank missiles. Several Russian tanks have been pictured with wire and steel ""cope cages"" attached to their turrets. The purpose of these is to force the missile to explode just before impacting the actual turret itself, hopefully mitigating the damage. The effectiveness of these cages is not yet known.",World/Yahoo News UK,What is an anti-tank weapon and how do they work?,https://news.yahoo.com/what-is-an-anti-tank-weapon-and-why-are-they-making-so-much-difference-in-ukraine-092149434.html

3/12/2022,"By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin gave the green light on Friday for up to 16,000 volunteers from the Middle East to be deployed alongside Russian-backed rebels to fight in Ukraine, doubling down an invasion that the West says has been losing momentum. The move, just over two weeks since Putin ordered the invasion, allows Russia to deploy battle-hardened mercenaries from conflicts such as Syria without risking additional Russian military casualties. At a meeting of Russia's Security Council, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said there were 16,000 volunteers in the Middle East who were ready to come to fight alongside Russian-backed forces in the breakaway Donbass region of eastern Ukraine. ""If you see that there are these people who want of their own accord, not for money, to come to help the people living in Donbass, then we need to give them what they want and help them get to the conflict zone,"" Putin said from the Kremlin. Shoigu also proposed that Western-made Javelin and Stinger missiles that were captured by the Russian army in Ukraine should be handed over to Donbass forces, along other weaponry such as man-portable air-defense systems, known as MANPADS, and anti-tank rocket complexes. ""As to the delivery of arms, especially Western-made ones which have fallen into the hands of the Russian army - of course I support the possibility of giving these to the military units of the Lugansk and Donetsk people's republics,"" Putin said. ""Please do this,"" he told Shoigu. The exchange was shown on Russian state television. Putin says the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is essential to ensure Russia's security after the United States expanded NATO up to its borders and supported pro-Western leaders in Kyiv. Ukraine says it is fighting for its existence while the United States, and its European and Asian allies have condemned the Russian invasion. China has called for calm. Shoigu said the operation was all going to plan before requesting Putin's approal for the use of fighters from the Middle East. U.S. intelligence chiefs told lawmakers on Thursday that Russia had been surprised by the strength of Ukrainian resistance, which had deprived the Kremlin of a quick victory it thought would have prevented the United States and NATO from providing meaningful military aid. That was causing concern in Beijing, Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns said. ""I do believe that the Chinese leadership, President Xi (Jinping) in particular, is unsettled,"" Burns said. ""By what he's seen, partly because his own intelligence doesn't appear to have told him what was going to happen."" Shoigu said Western arms were flowing into Ukraine in an ""absolutely uncontrolled"" way and that the Russian military planned to strengthen its Western border after what he said was a build up of Western military units on Russia's border. ""The general staff is working on, and has almost finished, a plan to strengthen our Western borders, including, naturally, with new modern complexes,"" Shoigu said. Putin said the question of how to react to moves by NATO countries need a separate discussion.

3/12/2022,"Mar. 10—Three now-dead cougars that found their way onto Flathead Lake's Wild Horse Island handily hunted down its bighorn sheep herd to as few as 35 of the prized Rocky Mountain ungulates. Although an initial sum, it's the lowest sheep count on the isle in at least 20 years, according to Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks. About 130 sheep were tallied on the island state park in 2019, with a couple dozen later removed by the department to help reestablish a herd in southwestern Montana. All told, the three adult mountain lions — which either swam to the island or accessed its shores via ice-bridge during recent winters — appear to have killed some 70 of the vulnerable bighorns before being killed by local wildlife officials over the past roughly two months. Sheep might now have to be moved to the island that has served as a prime source for nearly 600 disease-free bighorns to Montana, Washington and Oregon over the last half-century. If approved, it would be the first time in more than three decades that bighorns have been transplanted to Wild Horse Island to augment the herd and maintain a healthy genetic pool. An on-the-ground count estimates that 35 sheep remain on the island. ""That's what groups of people have seen; we haven't done a flight (survey) yet,"" Neil Anderson, regional FWP wildlife program manager, said of the more thorough method of counting the island's population. The department announced last week that one adult female and two adult male lions were killed over the winter to protect park visitors and to shield bighorn sheep lacking escape on the nearly 3.4-square-mile island. ""I think what people don't really realize is that Wild Horse Island has almost no escape terrain for bighorn sheep,"" Anderson said of cliffy, rocky areas that the agile sheep hoof to avoid threats. ""So, they're pretty vulnerable to predation,"" he said. ""To have that many mountain lions on the island, they could do a pretty good number on the sheep."" An adult male mountain lion's home range typically spans more than 100 square miles, with that of a female's being up to 60 square miles, according to the Forest Service. Robust in Montana, the big cats mostly eat deer but are known to eat anything from grasshoppers to moose, according to the Montana Field Guide. Wildlife officials plan to conduct a flight survey this spring to assess the cougars' damage to the prized sheep herd. Two bighorns were initially introduced to the island in 1939, having since thrived remotely with limited predation and no documented diseases. Ten total sheep have been transplanted to the island over the years, the last time being in 1987, when two bighorns were moved there from Lincoln County, according to Montana State Parks. Wildlife officials believe the three cougars — known as cunning, elusive creatures — either swam to the island or more likely accessed its shores in recent winters atop ice. In 2019, Flathead Lake nearly froze over for the first time since the early 1990s, though lake waters surrounding the island could have frozen more recently for the cats to gain access. Wild Horse Island lies just off the western shore of Flathead Lake, within the Flathead Reservation. FWP collaborated with the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes to remove the big cats. Wild Horse Island has produced some of the largest rams in the world, according to FWP. The department typically aims for an island population of between 100 to 120 bighorns to limit the environmental impact to the land, Anderson said. He said a 2019 island survey showed about 130. FWP removed 26 sheep last year to help reestablish a herd in Southwest Montana's Tendoy Mountains and maintain a sustainable herd for the island. That's about when sheep numbers began dropping. ""It started going down pretty significantly after that,"" Anderson said, also noting there remains no evidence showing the sheep dying off from disease. ""The logical explanation is predation."" Bear and lion have been documented on the island, ""but what people were starting to see is lions being more accustomed to some of the housing out there,"" he said of nearby landowners.

3/12/2022,"(Reuters) - Russia sought on Thursday to retaliate against Western sanctions imposed over its invasion of Ukraine by banning exports of certain goods and agricultural commodities. Exporting telecom, medical, auto, agricultural, electrical and tech equipment, as well as some forestry products, will be banned until the end of 2022. ""These measures are a logical response to those imposed against Russia and are aimed at ensuring uninterrupted functioning of key sectors of the economy,"" the economy ministry said. Further measures could include restricting foreign ships from entering Russian ports and allowing Russian airlines to register jets leased from Western firms as their own property, the government said. Interfax news agency cited a source familiar with legislation being prepared as saying Russia may temporarily ban grain exports to a group of ex-Soviet countries forming part of the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) from March 15 to August 31, as well as sugar exports outside the EEU area. The measures come after Western sanctions in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine that threaten to cripple Russia's energy-dependent economy. Western companies have pulled out of Russia en masse as the United States, European Union and Britain imposed sanctions aimed at curbing Moscow's access to funding. In response, a government commission on Wednesday approved the first step towards nationalising assets of foreign firms that leave the country. The proposal to restrict foreign ships' entry into Russian ports comes after Britain last week banned from its ports all Russian-operated ships. The European Union has yet to provide clarity on the prospect of a similar ban by the bloc.

3/12/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Top U.S. intelligence officials admitted Thursday that they underestimated Ukraine’s ability to defend itself against Russia’s invasion, a mistake for intelligence agencies that have otherwise been lauded for accurately predicting Russian President Vladimir Putin’s intention to launch a war. “My view was that, based on a variety of factors, that the Ukrainians were not as ready as I thought they should be,” said Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. “Therefore, I questioned their will to fight. That was a bad assessment on my part because they have fought bravely and honorably and are doing the right thing.” The White House has faced Republican criticism that it isn't providing enough weapons or intelligence to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The Biden administration is currently opposed to a Polish plan to donate old Russian-made warplanes to Ukraine, out of concern that Putin may view that as an escalation by the U.S. or NATO. Berrier testified alongside other top officials before the Senate Intelligence Committee. Generally, U.S. intelligence agencies have won praise from lawmakers of both political parties for their handling of the crisis. Much of the hearing focused on the unprecedented U.S. campaign to declassify intelligence about alleged attempts by Russia to create a fake pretext for its invasion. Even though Putin ordered the invasion anyway, lawmakers say the campaign helped develop support for sanctions that have crippled Russia's economy and pushed previously reluctant Western countries to give military aid to Ukraine. Two weeks into its invasion, Russia has failed to win control of Ukraine's airspace or subdue the capital of Kyiv or other major cities. But the war has had devastating consequences already: An airstrike hitting a maternity hospital, attacks on nuclear plants, and more than 2 million refugees having already fled the country with accounts of possible war crimes. There's no sign Putin intends to de-escalate. Russian propaganda outlets in recent days have promoted false theories that the U.S. and Ukraine are developing chemical weapons. The White House in turn has warned Russia is setting the pretext for its own chemical or biological attack. Berrier, who leads the Pentagon’s primary intelligence arm, said at Thursday’s hearing that just as Putin appeared to have misjudged his army’s ability to subdue Ukraine's much smaller armed forces, so did the U.S. “We made some assumptions about his assumptions, which proved to be very, very flawed,” said Berrier. “I think assessing will, morale, and a will to fight is a very difficult analytical task. We had different inputs from different organizations and we — at least from my perspective as the director — I did not do as well as I could have.” Berrier's admission follows another misjudgment in Afghanistan, whose U.S-backed government collapsed far more quickly to the Taliban than Washington expected. Officials believed the Afghan forces — long trained and funded by the U.S. — could hold out for potentially months after the American withdrawal. Instead, lacking U.S. air power and intelligence support, Afghan forces gave up many cities without a fight last summer. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said that Putin had underestimated the resistance he would face from the Ukrainians. But Haines added: “We did not do as well in terms of predicting the military challenges that he has encountered with his own military.” Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican who questioned Berrier and Haines, noted that assessing a foreign military's will to fight was particularly difficult. “But these mistakes had potentially real-world policy implications about the willingness of the president or other NATO leaders to provide weapons that they thought might have fallen into the hands of Russians in a matter of hours,” he said. Cotton and several other Republicans on the intelligence committee criticized the Biden administration’s current refusal to support a Polish plan to donate Russian-made warplanes to Ukraine. Biden administration officials have warned that Putin might view that as an escalation of the conflict. They say planes would go beyond the weapons the Pentagon and Western allies have already given Ukraine, including anti-tank systems and surface-to-air missiles to shoot down Russian aircraft. Asked if the White House was pressuring analysts to assess that the transfer of planes would be seen as escalatory, Haines responded that objectivity was a “core ethic” of intelligence.",Politics/Associated Press,"US misjudged Ukraine's will to fight Russia, officials admit",https://news.yahoo.com/us-misjudged-ukraines-fight-russia-185851020.html

One of the stocks identified by the SEC included Yum China, which fell as much as 15%. The companies identified by the SEC for potential delisting can respond with information to prevent the delisting. The US Securities and Exchange Commission is taking a tough look at Chinese stocks and investors are taking notice. Popular Chinese stocks like Alibaba plunged as much as 10% on Thursday after the regulatory agency identified five Chinese companies for potential delisting from US exchanges due to inadequate disclosures. The five companies identified by the SEC were BeiGene, Yum China Holdings, Zai Lab Limited, ACM Research, and HUTCHMED Limited. Shares of Yum China, which owns the franchise rights to KFC and Taco Bell in China, fell as much as 15% following the SEC notice. The SEC's decision comes after the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act became law on December 18, 2020. The law requires the SEC to identify publicly traded foreign companies on US exchanges that will not allow a US auditor to fully inspect their financial books. This is the first time the SEC identified companies since the law went into effect. The five companies identified by the SEC have until March 29 to submit evidence disputing the SEC's identification under the HFCAA law. The SEC ultimately has the power to delist the Chinese stocks if for three straight years they do not allow a US accounting firm to conduct an audit of its financial statements. All of this translates to a growing divide between the US and China, and it could cost investors billions of dollars. If a US-listed Chinese company does not allow a US-based accounting firm to audit its financials, it will be in violation of the new law and subject to delisting. That means shares will have to be relisted on a foreign exchange, and it could lead to a big headache for US investors that own the stock, as they may not have access to foreign markets. While Alibaba and JD.com have not been identified by the SEC under the HFCAA law, that's not stopping investors from heading for the exit. But one investor that might see value in this downside volatility is Warren Buffett's right hand man, Charlie Munger, as his Daily Journal Company has built a significant stake in the Chinese e-commerce giant.

3/12/2022,"LISBON (Reuters) - Officers in Portugal's northern city of Porto have detained the leader of the Jewish community there, saying he issued the document allowing Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich to get Portuguese citizenship last year, authorities said on Friday. Officers from the criminal investigation agency PJ detained rabbi Daniel Litvak as part of an ongoing inquiry by public prosecutors into the granting of citizenship to Chelsea soccer club owner Abramovich, Publico newspaper said earlier. In a statement, Porto's Jewish community denied any wrongdoing and said it is was the target of a “smear campaign”. It said that rabbi Litvak oversaw the department that certifies Portuguese nationality on the basis of criteria that ""have been accepted by successive governments”. Abramovich was granted citizenship in April 2021 based on a law offering naturalisation to descendants of Sephardic Jews who were expelled from the Iberian peninsula during the Mediaeval Inquisition. There is little known history of Sephardic Jews in Russia, although Abramovich is a common surname of Ashkenazi Jewish origin. Applicants' genealogies are vetted by experts at one of Portugal's Jewish centres in Lisbon or Porto. The Porto centre, where Litvak is the rabbi, was responsible for Abramovich's process. Public prosecutors opened an inquiry in January.. On Thursday, a Portuguese government source told Reuters Abramovich's citizenship could be stripped depending on the outcome of the inquiry. In a joint statement, PJ and the public prosecutors said a suspect had been detained on Thursday but did not name the rabbi, adding the suspect would appear before a judge. It said its officers raided homes, a lawyer's office and others spaces on Friday as part of the investigation into crimes such as money laundering, corruption and falsification of documents. Evidence was collected and would be analysed, it added. Litvak was preparing to travel to Israel when he was detained, Publico said. Porto’s Jewish community said public prosecutors were also investigating the certification of Portuguese nationality granted by Lisbon’s Jewish community to Franco-Israeli billionaire Patrick Drahi, the founder of Altice telecom group. Altice was not immediately available for comment.

3/12/2022,"(Adds defence ministry denial and accusation against Ukraine) By Mark Trevelyan LONDON, March 10 (Reuters) - Russia shifted its stance over the bombing of a Ukrainian hospital in the city of Mariupol, with a mix of statements on Thursday that veered between aggressive denials and a call by the Kremlin to establish clear facts. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said three people including a child had been killed in the bombing on Wednesday, and rejected Russian assertions there had been no patients there. ""Like always, they lie confidently,"" said Zelenskiy, who has accused Moscow of waging genocide in the war it launched two weeks ago. In the face of worldwide condemnation there were rare signs of inconsistency in the response from Russian officials, who since the start of Moscow's invasion on Feb. 24 have stuck tightly to the same narrative for what Russia calls its special military operation in Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, asked for comment in the immediate aftermath, told Reuters on Wednesday: ""Russian forces do not fire on civilian targets."" On Thursday he said the Kremlin would look into the incident. ""We will definitely ask our military, because you and I don't have clear information about what happened there,"" Peskov told reporters. ""And the military are very likely to provide some information."" 'INFORMATION TERRORISM' Other Russian officials took a more aggressive line, rejecting the hospital bombing as fake news. ""This is information terrorism,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. The Defence Ministry later denied having bombed the hospital, accusing Ukraine of staging the incident. It said Russian forces at the time had been respecting an agreement to hold fire to allow the evacuation of civilians. ""Russian aviation carried out absolutely no strikes on ground targets in the area,"" spokesman Igor Konashenkov said. ""The alleged air strike was completely a staged provocation... that can deceive the Western public but not an expert."" Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov attacked what he called ""pathetic shouting about so-called atrocities by the Russian armed forces"". He told reporters after meeting Ukraine's foreign minister in Turkey that the hospital building had for days been under the control of ultra-radical Ukrainian forces who had emptied out the doctors and patients - the version rejected by Zelenskiy as a lie. Moscow says it is conducting a special military operation to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Kyiv and the West reject these as false pretexts for an invasion of a democratic country of 44 million people. On Wednesday, the United States denied renewed Russian accusations that Washington was operating biowarfare labs in Ukraine, calling the claims ""laughable"".

3/12/2022,"Amid the coverage of attacks on Ukraine by Russian forces, those with ties to other countries in conflict are raising questions about inequalities in public response. A series of clips are circulating on social media in which broadcasters and interviewees on major platforms make statements that seemingly paint Ukrainian victims of tragedy as more sympathetic than non-European victims. In one BBC interview, Ukraine’s Deputy Chief Prosecutor David Sakvarelidze is quoted remarking on how the current tragedy is “very emotional” because he sees “European people with blue eyes and blonde hair being killed."" Similarly, a Telegraph op-ed by writer and former politician Daniel Hannan begins by stating that what makes the Russian invasion so shocking is that its victims “seem so like us.” Hannan specifically highlights that these victims are European: “War is no longer something visited upon impoverished and remote populations.” In response to these statements, members of the public are questioning the increased empathy and public support afforded to European victims, in contrast to the minimizing of atrocities that impact non-European countries. Matt Duss, a Ukrainian-American foreign policy advisor to U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, spoke out on social media about the disparity he witnessed in public response. “As a Ukrainian-American I am immensely proud of the bravery of Ukrainians and of the support being shown by Americans,” he wrote on Twitter. “As a Middle East analyst I am floored by the blatant double standard on resisting occupation and repression.” Megan Boler is a professor in the Department of Social Justice Education at the University of Toronto. Her research specialties include the politics of digital and social media, and the role of race, class, and gender in education and media. “To me, it’s a very shocking contrast to the representation of war in other places,” Boler told Yahoo News Canada. Boler said she is “acutely aware” of how different periods of media representation have changed the public’s access to war, and shaped the view of the public. The people who are saying these things seem to be marked by their own racial identity and privilege. I find it really shocking that commentators would make these kinds of statements that are so utterly degrading to the tragedies of what has happened to people in other war-torn areas, most recently Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan.Megan Boler, Professor in the Department of Social Justice Education at the University of Toronto In one such video, a television presenter mentions the use of thermobaric bombs — massively destructive vacuum bombs that can completely annihilate anyone in the area. He acknowledges that these bombs have by the United States in Afghanistan in the past. “But,” he says, “the idea of it being used in Europe is stomach-churning.” Some of Boler’s academic research focused on the 2003 American invasion of Iraq, and she noted the favourable attitudes towards this invasion being promoted at the time: “The propaganda at the time was just incredible, it was just outrageous.” “Anyone who opposed the U.S. invasion was seen as a traitor,” she said. “The representation of people in Iraq did not represent people as human. We really got very little coverage.” Due to the economic differences between Ukraine and Syria, Boler acknowledged that those on the ground in Ukraine have increased capability to show the public the reality of war. However, she does not believe this is the sole cause of increased public attention. Even if those in Syria had this capability, she does not necessarily believe there would have been increased empathy. There wasn’t public attention on what was happening to that population. Because they were brown, because many of them were Muslim, and because they were not people who were valued in our society, or in our political landscape.Megan Boler, Professor in the Department of Social Justice Education at the University of Toronto Boler added that the double standard can be seen beyond the headlines. “We might even think about how that perception, or that racism, is infusing the global response at the national level, in terms of nations that are stepping up to take action.” “It’s not just at the level of individuals and individual reporters whose racism is being exposed, but also essentially whose life is valued at the level of international global political discourse,” she said. Boler highlighted that just as social media platforms these perspectives, it also provides an avenue for accountability. “We will begin to see that there is just a profound racism that shapes news coverage,” she said. “Social media is going to be able to call out the racism in news coverage, and that is an upside of hearing these outrageous comments.”",News/Yahoo News Canada,"'Utterly degrading': Ukraine war coverage reveals devastating truth about which lives are globally valued, expert says",https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-war-bias-coverage-russia-putin-193028640.html

3/12/2022,"(Recasts headline and lead) By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON, March 11 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin gave the green light on Friday for up to 16,000 volunteers from the Middle East to be deployed alongside Russian-backed rebels to fight in Ukraine, doubling down an invasion that the West says has been losing momentum. The move, just over two weeks since Putin ordered the invasion, allows Russia to deploy battle-hardened mercenaries from conflicts such as Syria without risking additional Russian military casualties. At a meeting of Russia's Security Council, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said there were 16,000 volunteers in the Middle East who were ready to come to fight alongside Russian-backed forces in the breakaway Donbass region of eastern Ukraine. ""If you see that there are these people who want of their own accord, not for money, to come to help the people living in Donbass, then we need to give them what they want and help them get to the conflict zone,"" Putin said from the Kremlin. Shoigu also proposed that Western-made Javelin and Stinger missiles that were captured by the Russian army in Ukraine should be handed over to Donbass forces, along other weaponry such as man-portable air-defense systems, known as MANPADS, and anti-tank rocket complexes. ""As to the delivery of arms, especially Western-made ones which have fallen into the hands of the Russian army - of course I support the possibility of giving these to the military units of the Lugansk and Donetsk people's republics,"" Putin said. ""Please do this,"" he told Shoigu. The exchange was shown on Russian state television. Putin says the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is essential to ensure Russia's security after the United States expanded NATO up to its borders and supported pro-Western leaders in Kyiv. Ukraine says it is fighting for its existence while the United States, and its European and Asian allies have condemned the Russian invasion. China has called for calm. Shoigu said the operation was all going to plan before requesting Putin's approal for the use of fighters from the Middle East. U.S. intelligence chiefs told lawmakers on Thursday that Russia had been surprised by the strength of Ukrainian resistance, which had deprived the Kremlin of a quick victory it thought would have prevented the United States and NATO from providing meaningful military aid. That was causing concern in Beijing, Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns said. ""I do believe that the Chinese leadership, President Xi (Jinping) in particular, is unsettled,"" Burns said. ""By what he's seen, partly because his own intelligence doesn't appear to have told him what was going to happen."" Shoigu said Western arms were flowing into Ukraine in an ""absolutely uncontrolled"" way and that the Russian military planned to strengthen its Western border after what he said was a build up of Western military units on Russia's border. ""The general staff is working on, and has almost finished, a plan to strengthen our Western borders, including, naturally, with new modern complexes,"" Shoigu said. Putin said the question of how to react to moves by NATO countries need a separate discussion.
