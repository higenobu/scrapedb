3/20/2022,"No doubts, no caveats. Marcell Jacobs proved emphatically that he is the fastest man on the planet as he won a race for the ages at the world indoor championships. Many had derided Jacobs’ 100m Olympic gold medal in Tokyo last year as a fluke. But he summoned a performance of devastating serenity to defeat the world 60m record holder Christian Coleman in a barnstormer of a contest that lived up to its billing. Coleman, who was back after serving an 18-month ban for missing three drugs tests, made his usual fluid start and was ahead after 30m. But Jacobs didn’t flinch or adjust his form. Gradually he gained. Until, just at the moment the two men crossed the line, he got his chest in front. Both men had run 6.41 seconds – the ninth quickest time in history. But, after an eternal wait, Jacobs got the nod by three-thousandths of a second. “I hoped and prayed, please first, and it happened,” he said. He was then asked whether he thought he had proved a point. “Of course,” he replied. “Now I’m an Olympic and world champion.” Another American, Marvin Bracy, took bronze in 6.44, while Britain’s Adam Thomas was fifth in 6.60 sec. But while he may have lost this battle, Coleman insisted he would be back for more in the summer. “I think it’ll be neck and neck like today,” he said. “He’s a great athlete and I’m looking forward to the competition.” Elsewhere on the second day of competition there were gold medals for Olympic 400m champion Shaunae Miller-Uibo, who ran a storming 50.31 sec to beat Femke Bol, and Sandi Morris in the women’s pole vault. Meanwhile Jereem Richards ran a championship record 45.00 to take the men’s 400m. He dedicated his victory to his friend and team-mate Deon Lendore, who died in a car crash, saying: “Rest in peace, man.” However British Athletics was facing the prospect of leaving these championships without a medal after its best hope of gold, Keely Hodgkinson, was forced to pull out through injury. The 20-year-old had been the odds-on favourite to win the 800m, having run the sixth fastest time in history last month. However she withdrew as a precaution after a scan found a minor tear in her right thigh.",Sport/Sport,Marcell Jacobs beats Christian Coleman to prove he is world’s fastest man,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/19/marcell-jacobs-beats-christian-coleman-to-prove-he-is-the-fastest-man
3/20/2022,"There have been some thumping French grand slam victories but never one that has rippled so ominously around the world. Not for a dozen years have France claimed a Six Nations clean sweep but in many ways the dazzling beauty of this one lies in what might still lie ahead. On this evidence anyone else planning to win next year’s Rugby World Cup is going to be disappointed. England’s players deserve considerable credit simply for hanging in the fight but once Antoine Dupont had surged irresistibly clear at the start of the final quarter to put his side clear at 25-13 it was effectively all over. Not a solitary English supporter present in Paris or watching at home could say the outcome of this compelling finale was anything other than totally deserved. The final table rarely lies, either, and the best team in the tournament duly finished well ahead of the pack. England were a touch fortunate that Scotland and Wales both lost on the final day, thus sparing them the indignity of a second successive bottom-half finish, but there could be no hiding from the frequently uneven battle at the breakdown, the power of the French forwards or the rock-solid composure of the home side’s outstanding defence. The old cliche used to be that Paris in the springtime is when French rugby truly comes alive. But if the stadium was rocking to its foundations last night, just imagine the atmosphere when the Rugby World Cup kicks off next year. Were the tournament commencing this week Les Bleus would be favourites and they still look to have plenty of growth in them. ‘Super Saturday’ certainly lived up to its billing, even if the most stunning performance of the day had already been delivered by Italy in Cardiff. As a beautiful sunny day gave way to a cool still evening, there were so many tricolores around the stadium it felt more like a slickly organised political rally than a game of rugby. Highlights of past French triumphs on the big screen, a stunning light show, fireworks, epic orchestral music‚ you half expected Fabien Galthié to be fired out of the tunnel from a cannon. As Eddie Jones had acknowledged in the build up, though, this was also an acid test for England. The head coach would have smiled wryly at the sign outside an Australian bar near Chàtelet – ‘No worries. Keep calm, mate’ – but the front page of L’Equipe told a different story. ‘Operation Grand Chelem’ screamed the headline and the mission statement needed no translating. The challenge for the visitors was to offer something more than just stout defiance and a valiant kick-chasing game. Passion, pride and perseverance are all important qualities but, as Italy triumphantly demonstrated in Wales, there is also a fourth ‘p’ in the mix. The positivity that oozes from the Azzurri’s young full-back Ange Capuozzo will be just as much of a crucial World Cup prerequisite on firm pitches at a French World Cup as set-piece solidity. That said, France’s defensive barricade is now a serious stumbling block for all and sundry. Quite content to allow Ellis Genge to charge at them from deep, the home side absorbed the early pressure with total composure and only a cluster of unforced handling errors saved England from shipping a couple of early tries. By the 15th minute, though, the dam had already burst with Gael Fickou gathering Romain Ntamack’s long pass to reward an ominous spell of all-court pressure. Melvyn Jaminet had already knocked over a scrum penalty and England were suitably grateful for three relieving points of their own from Marcus Smith, They were also fortunate not to be reduced to 14 men after Jack Nowell took out a soaring Jaminet in the air, with referee Jaco Peyper awarding a penalty the other way for obstruction. With England getting regularly picked off at the breakdown, however, it did not remotely knock France out of their stride. A second Jaminet penalty and Nowell’s premature departure with a hand injury further tilted the scales and, after yet another butchered opportunity, Gabin Villiere and Anthony Jelonch combined to set up flanker Francois Cros for a stretching score just before the break to make it 18-6. At least England can say that courage in adversity is not an area of concern. Over the course of the championship, few have enhanced their top-level reputation more than Maro Itoje with Genge not far behind. Smith now has also has a full championship season behind him and will ultimately be the better for it. There was a flicker of try-scoring promise, too, Freddie Steward muscling his way over in the corner after 47 minutes for only the third try England have scored in four games away from Rome. Steward and Joe Marchant both had notable games but maybe there is a simpler bottom line: France are currently just better than England, full stop. Admittedly Luke Cowan-Dickie’s yellow card against Scotland, when his side were ahead, and Charlie Ewels’ second minute red against Ireland both proved extremely costly but third position is a fair reflection of England’s current standing. Only one of these two sides presently looks like winning next year’s World Cup and it is not the battered and bruised men in white.",Sport/Sport,Antoine Dupont try sinks England and secures grand slam for France,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/19/france-england-six-nations-rugby-union-match-report
3/20/2022,"The Riverside has been no stranger to the sight of empty seats in recent years, but on Saturday those that surrounded the 700 or so Chelsea fans who had managed to buy tickets before Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK government told not of Middlesbrough’s troubles but a more poignant story of the state of English football. Football’s capacity to normalise the most ludicrous scenarios is remarkable. It is only three weeks since Abramovich declared his intention to hand over “stewardship and care” of the club to its trustees and yet that already feels at least two major news cycles ago. The idea that Chelsea have to be parted from their owner because they have, for almost two decades, been a pawn in a far greater game has been generally assimilated. We have done the weary horror, the ‘what-have-we-become?’ of the league game against Newcastle. This was the first domestic away game where the sanctions had an impact on ticket sales, but there will be gaps at home games, a complete absence of away fans and the possibility of a half-empty Wembley for the semi-final, depending how the FA can organise ticket sales – which are usually conducted through the club. At some point the impact on ticket sales will stop being mentioned. Then there will be a new owner and a concrete new reality to get used to. The current crisis has been generally assimilated – but not yet universally. There remains a sense that some elements of the club have not fully accepted the reality of the present situation, the fact that they have been granted special dispensation to carry on playing that would not ordinarily be granted to the majority of businesses. Attempts to have the game played behind closed doors on the grounds of “sporting integrity” were rightly derided and ultimately withdrawn. Some fans, the vocal minority who use photographs of Abramovich as their social media avatars and get themselves interviewed on vox pops, persist in seeing the whole tragedy of Ukraine through the lens of football, as though Chelsea are the victims of some complex conspiracy and the war just a useful excuse to confound them. The vast majority of the Chelsea fans at the Riverside, it should be said, stood and joined the pre-match applause for Ukraine. A banner on the seats at the front of the stand read “Tuchel for PM” – something suggested by Joe Cole earlier in the week – and it says much for the statesmanlike way in which he has handled an extremely awkward period that the instinctive reaction to the sentiment is that he has the humanity and basic decency, the sense of responsibility, that used to be a prerequisite for leaders. After all the talk of Chelsea travelling to Middlesbrough by bus, they ended up flying to Teesside International – only the most cynical, though, would think that they have been over-dramatising their immediate plight to gain public sympathy. For now, though, the storm remains that is yet fully to break. From a playing point of view, life has so far, bar a few pointed chants from opposing fans, gone on largely as normal, whatever the threats may be for the future, with Chelsea winning every game since Abramovich announced his intention to step away from the club. But there is also a secondary timeframe. While geopolitics is going through one of its phases of acceleration, football retains the familiar rhythms. Last time Romelu Lukaku started a game for Chelsea was in the fifth round of the FA Cup against Luton, when he was just a misfit £100m striker, rather the costliest human resource of a sanctioned business. He scored then, as he had scored against Chesterfield in the third round, and got his third in the competition this season after 19 minutes, touching in a Mason Mount cross. From that point, frankly, this was a very straightforward afternoon for Chelsea. Middlesbrough never looked to have the quality to really trouble them, while Hakim Ziyech and Mason Mount had little problem finding the space that allowed them to slice Boro apart. On the pitch, it was all rather anti-climactic, but with Chelsea the story these days is only partially about that. Their present reality was written, the red plastic seats in the south-east corner of the ground.",Sport/Football,Empty seats in FA Cup a visible reminder of Chelsea’s present reality | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/19/empty-seats-in-fa-cup-a-visible-reminder-of-chelseas-present-reality
