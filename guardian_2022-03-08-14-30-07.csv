3/8/2022,"After four days on the road, sleeping in her car, Ludmila Lyskevska was in a defiant mood. “Putin has gone bonkers. He wants Ukraine to be part of his imperium,” she said, stretching her legs as snow fell from a white sky. “He’s managed to unite the whole country against him.” Lyskevska was travelling in a three-car family convoy. The group was part of a vast caravan of vehicles waiting to leave war-stricken Ukraine and cross the border into Poland. Over the course of a 20-minute conversation, her group advanced a mere 100 metres. They had been queueing for 20 hours. Behind her, more cars arrived. A pensioner, she set off on Friday from the southern city of Zaporizhia on the Dnipro river. Why did they escape? “The Russians were closing in. They seized our nuclear power plant,” she said. “We feared an explosion.” She left with her daughter, son-in-law, three grandkids and a dog, now being walked on the grass next to a petrol station. Across Ukraine, millions of people are similarly on the move. As of Sunday night more than 1.7 million people have fled abroad, with 1 million crossing into Poland, according to the UN. Others had exited western Ukraine for Slovakia, Hungary, Moldova and Romania. It is Europe’s biggest refugee crisis since the second world war. And it is only just beginning. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has banned men aged 18-60 from leaving the country. More than 60,000 Ukrainian expats have returned home since Russia’s invasion in order to fight. A few men waiting in the queue at the Ukrainian border town of Krakovets said they would drop their families off in Poland before returning home to take up arms. Many of those fleeing had friends and family in enemy Russia. Lyskevska said she had quarrelled with her sister who lives in St Petersburg with her Russian husband. “I rang them up. He told me the Kremlin was only bombing military infrastructure. I asked him to stop watching Russian state TV and said: ‘Our people are dying.’ He doesn’t believe me.” “Putin’s soldiers are killing civilians and shelling cities. They destroy everything. Look at Mariupol,” Lyskevska’s daughter Lena said. During their epic road trip, the family saw a rocket attack when they had parked up for the night. “We heard the explosions. Seven of them. It was terrible,” she said. The route to the border follows Ukraine’s M10 highway. It passes the western city of Lviv and goes through a long stretch of thick pine forest. Along the way are several new checkpoints manned by soldiers and local militia wearing hi-vis jackets. There are sandbags, green camouflage nets, machine-gun posts and piles of logs neatly stacked next to braziers. War feels everywhere. There is also a sense that today’s bitter conflict between Kyiv and Moscow blends with previous historic struggles. Blue and yellow flags fly next to the red and black flag of the Ukrainian insurgent army, which fought against the Red army during the second world war. Roadside billboards read: “It’s our home. We will bury you here” and “Fuck off, Russian warship”, a popular meme. The 12km queue begins on a desolate stretch of road surrounded by yellow scrub and fir trees. Many cars have signs on the windscreen with the word “Deti” – children – in Russian. On Monday the queue was 1,300 vehicles long, plus 500 pedestrians. Some mothers emerged from taxis, and walked the last few kilometres, dragging along children and suitcases. “After seven days sleeping in a Kyiv metro station, we decided to get out,” Marina Pavlova said, explaining that her 13-year-old son, Matvey, had medical issues. She added: “We are Russian speakers. We don’t need Putin to ‘save us’. We have friends like us from Kharkiv. They have vowed to only speak Ukrainian from now on because of what he has done.” Galina Padalko, a communications manager, said she and her husband, Dmytro, left Kharkiv over the weekend, after days of bombardment that saw their flat tremble. A Grad missile landed nearby last Tuesday, blowing the leg off and killing a woman who was out buying supplies. “A couple of rockets fell not far from us. We couldn’t stand it, so we decided to evacuate,” Padalko said. They walked for an hour and half to the train station, stood in a line for eight hours in -3C, and got on a train heading west. Padalko shared a video showing desperate passengers clambering over the rails in darkness before standing in packed carriages. “We travelled for 26 hours in an old electric train to western Ukraine. As we left, the Russian army shot at us,” she said. Stas Mykailov said he and his wife, Daria, decided to flee after a bomb landed close to their kids’ school, in Kharkiv’s Severna Saltivka district. “I’m an engineer. I left my flat, car, job, everything. It’s gone.” The family left by train and travelled for 18 hours. “It was very hard. Some people hadn’t brought enough water. Volunteers gave us water and apples,” he said. Mykailov said Russia was to blame for the conflict and could go “fuck itself”. “The situation is shit. I have Russian relatives. They don’t understand what’s going on here. A friend of mine called his mum in St Petersburg and she told him he was making a fuss. He shouted at her. He said he wouldn’t talk to her again until she had burned her Russian passport.” After arranging a lift to safety for his wife and two small children, Mykailov returned to the city of Lviv, 62km from the Polish border. He checked on their progress via an app on the Telegram platform that gives real-time updates. It took them 27 hours to cross, he said. “They made it an hour ago. They were four women and three kids in a car. They will go to a hotel and sleep.” He added: “At first the Polish border guard didn’t want to let them cross because the car has only five seats. Fortunately, she was a woman and she relented.” Mykailov said since they escaped from Kharkiv, a rocket had buried itself on the roof of his apartment block. “I’m on the 11th floor. It seems we have a flat without windows. The building now has a hole,” he said. Amid this biblical exodus, few refugees had given much thought as to what they might do in Poland. Nobody knew on Monday how long exile might last or whether Ukraine would exist as a sovereign entity by the time they returned. Many expressed support for President Zelenskiy. He has refused US offers of evacuation and has remained in Kyiv, despite great personal risk. Lyskevska’s grandson Dmitriy Hoholenko, who is 16, said he hoped to continue studying in Poland. The war had stopped his education. He and his classmates were too young to fight. They were patriots, he said. “I hope to find a Ukrainian school somewhere in Poland,” he added in English. And long-term? “I want to be a graphic designer,” he replied.",News/World news,‘We couldn’t stand it’: the Ukrainians travelling for days to flee Russian bombs and rockets,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/we-couldnt-stand-it-the-ukrainians-travelling-for-days-to-flee-russian-bombs-and-rockets
3/8/2022,"Against a constant backdrop of shelling and air raids, more than 1,200 international students remain trapped in the besieged city of Sumy, eastern Ukraine. Diplomatic efforts to evacuate them and create a safe corridor appear to have stalled. Many of the students have run out of water, resorting at times to boiling ice, and are running out of food. In their desperation, many are contemplating taking a treacherous journey out of the city to Poltava, 110 miles to the south. Ukrainian soldiers have warned students who have tried to leave to stay in the hostels. The journey passes dangerously close to the fighting on the outskirts of Sumy. Yet some students have felt they had no choice. Last Thursday Oluwaseun Adefemi, a Nigerian medical student in his 20s, and three of his friends paid a driver $1,600 (£1,220), several times the usual fee, and fled. “My heart was pounding, I didn’t know what to do, but I knew I had to leave. The main route to the city had been bombed, the train station had been bombed. But we finally heard that there was another route through the forests,” he said. “That day the driver just called me to say that he’s in front of the hostel. I hadn’t showered, I hadn’t brushed my teeth, my luggage wasn’t packed. I basically left everything, I just packed my documents and we started running down to the car.” At checkpoints controlled by Ukrainian soldiers, the driver told troops he was taking the students to a safety zone close to the outskirts of the city. “Then, when we started getting to the outskirts everything looked so much more real. There were destroyed armoured tanks, destroyed buses. Stains of blood everywhere on the ground. Cars that were mashed up, like armoured tanks drove over them. “There was a burial, by some soldiers. I couldn’t tell which soldiers they were but they were burying someone.” Then they drove, speeding through the snow-covered forest, parallel to main roads to Poltova that were not safe to drive on. “At times you could see the main roads through the forest. We saw armoured tanks, soldiers delivering weapons. Sometimes we saw that they were Ukrainians, because they had a band around their arm in the colour of their flag. “Sometimes we saw young people, 18, 19, 20 years old, holding guns, ready to fight. We didn’t follow routes where we thought the Russians were. I was 80 or 90% sure that if they saw us we would be shot on sight.” Adefemi’s driver was a 36-year-old Ukrainian. “He was tense. It was obvious he was afraid. He was going at outrageous speeds. The ground was covered in snow, he was trying to keep the car in control while speeding.” For large spells of the journey they lost network and were “driving blind” through forestry. After two hours of driving, they finally reached a nearby city where things felt calmer. “We wound down the windows. He played music, something Ukrainian. He relaxed, the speed reduced, he looked calm. We were getting close to Poltava.” The following day Adefemi travelled to the Hungarian border and on Sunday he arrived in Budapest, where he is staying with a relative. The journey felt like an “impossible mission” he said, with several points where it felt they could be speeding into military conflict.” Renish Joseph, from Kerala, India, is a student coordinator at Sumy State University and has lived in Ukraine for 10 years. He is currently sheltering in the university hostel with his Ukrainian wife and their two-month-old baby. He said there had been no running water in the hostel for days and tensions were running high. “Things are bad here, tomorrow will be our 15th day,” said Joseph. “These are students who are just 17 or 18 years old, this is the first time in their lives they are facing anything like this situation. This war comes after two years of dealing with Covid so physically and mentally the students are very depressed and very tired. “Every day they’re hoping that today they will be evacuated and then when it doesn’t happen, they’re getting more and more depressed and losing all hope. Some students have started experiencing bad psychological problems. At night, they will start crying or pacing around.” With no running water for drinking, showers or toilets, Joseph said the students were reliant on volunteers who came into the hostel every day with thousands of litres of water. “The students are collecting it in water bottles and using it for everything, drinking and personal hygiene. It’s desperate.” He said they went out for food early in the mornings but had to queue for hours outside supermarkets in freezing temperatures and food supplies inside stores were running low. So far, Jospeh said fighting had remained on the peripheries of Sumy and was not in the city, but he was concerned that a perception among locals that foreign students may be wealthy could put them at risk. “Everybody has a gun and we are worried because we are foreigners with brown skin so we are very visible and so anything can happen to us,” he said. “We are safe for now but we have heard that looting has already started so I don’t think we will be safe here much longer.” While the Indian government have announced an evacuation plan to get the students out via the polish border town of Poltava, which is around 150 miles away, and told them to be “ready at short notice”, so far it has been too dangerous to implement. “There are only four to five routes which we can leave the city and all are blocked by fighting,” said Joseph. “The Russian border is only 40km [25 miles] away, but we cannot travel to Russia because Ukrainians will not allow it. So we are stuck.”",News/World news,Sumy: international students in Ukrainian city tell of desperation,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/sumy-international-students-in-ukrainian-city-tell-of-desperation
3/8/2022,"A mother and son have died, cars are trapped on flooded roads and suburbs are cut off as parts of Sydney are inundated and thousands ordered to evacuate. Australia’s death toll from the floods has risen to 21 as a massive stretch of the New South Wales coast is copping dangerous winds and heavy rains, causing landslides and wild surf conditions as a second east coast low moves in. Some 40,000 people have been told to leave their homes in NSW, covering more than a dozen Sydney suburbs including parts of the northern beaches. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, said the Manly Dam in Sydney’s north had begun spilling, potentially impacting some 2,000 people and 800 homes. Residents in low-lying areas were urged to evacuate immediately. The State Emergency Service later amended the order to an evacuation warning as water levels at the dam dropped slightly. There were 59 evacuation orders in place from Kempsey in northern NSW down to the Illawarra, while a further 15 evacuation warnings were impacting 20,000 residents. Two bodies were discovered in western Sydney on Tuesday morning amid the rising flood waters – a 67-year-old mother and her 34-year-old son from Wentworthville – whose abandoned car was found earlier. It brought the death toll across the state to eight. Sydney Trains were imploring people to avoid nonessential travel as water pooled at platforms across the city, while the bureau warned driving conditions were dangerous in all suburbs amid slippery, flooded roads. The Roseville Bridge, which crosses Middle Harbour in Sydney’s north, was swamped with water on Tuesday afternoon, trapping cars and causing major delays. Sydneywas pummelled with 95.4mm of rain during the 24 hours to 9am Tuesday, making it the wettest start to the year on record. Authorities closed many of the main roads surrounding the Georges River, including Henry Lawson Drive and Milperra Road, with entire sections of streets completely underwater. The usually bustling Newbridge Road was closed by authorities, with the river having risen up to 3.65m earlier on Tuesday, and with the water reaching up to 1.5m in residents’ homes. From a friend. Roseville Bridge now. #SydneyStorm pic.twitter.com/qN2pNykKB1 Anthony Lippis, who lives just off Newbridge Road, said the water came into his home “in a flash”. “I lost my car, and we didn’t have enough time to save it. It’s heartbreaking. Every time this happens we need to move everything up a level, and it is exhausting, it’s devastating for everybody.” Emu Heights on the Nepean river right now as Blue Mountains is declared a disaster zone. #floods pic.twitter.com/2jcUoDinUL On Tuesday afternoon, a line of very heavy showers and a few thunderstorms was detected near Hornsby, Parramatta, Sydney City, the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Richmond and waters off Bondi Beach. The Blue Mountains was declared a natural disaster area as landslips and collapsed roads wreaked havoc on commuters. “These thunderstorms are slow-moving. Intense rainfall that may lead to dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding is likely,” the Bureau of Meteorology said. Dean Narramore from the Bureau of Meteorology said it had been a “devastating week” for the state, with the conditions not expected to ease until sometime Thursday. “Since 9 this morning, we have seen 50 to 100mm [of rain] in the northern suburbs and that is pushing up to the Central Coast. We have seen a flash flooding … likely to move further north in the coming days,” he said. “Both the Hawkesbury River and the Nepean River are in danger of major flooding with many locations experiencing levels equal to or greater than what we saw in March of 2021.” The streets and homes surrounding Georges River in western Sydney were inundated by the driving rain, with many only able to watch on as the water swallowed up their homes and cars. Thousands of residents in the south-west were ordered to evacuate on Monday night as heavy rain swelled rivers. Rainfall in excess of 80mm was detected in a two-hour period in Marrickville, Kentlyn and Lucas Heights on Monday. In the 12 hours to 6.22pm, Mittagong was lashed with 197mm of rain. Six-hour rainfall totals between 70 and 120mm were possible for the Hunter, Sydney, Illawarra, South Coast and parts of the Central Tablelands. Isolated totals in excess of 150mm were possible. There were 25 flood warnings in place across NSW from the mid-north coast to the south coast, while all but two of the state’s major dams were at 100% capacity. Major flooding was possible at Kempsey from Tuesday afternoon, with a possible peak near the major flood level of 6.6m at the Macleay River. The last time flood waters reached that level was in the 2013 floods, when the river reached 7.1m. Other rivers, including the Hawkesbury, were flooding at levels exceeding last week and surpassing 2021. NSW SES has fielded more than 2,500 calls for assistance and 200 flood rescues and flood-related calls for assistance. Some 887 people are in temporary accommodation. Earlier on Tuesday, Perrottet said there needed to be “frank assessments” of the state’s disaster mitigation strategies once the severe weather event had subsided. The Hawkesbury River is now higher at North Richmond and Windsor than it was last week. This is the same swing set. @abcnews https://t.co/061Dy7qFcg pic.twitter.com/gR9QQXhMJH In Queensland, severe thunderstorms with damaging winds were approaching, expected to hit between Ayr and Gympie on Tuesday afternoon. Eight flood warnings remained active across the state as clean-up continued, with major flooding occurring at the Condamine and Balonne rivers and the lower Moonie River. The state recorded its 13th flood death after the body of a 31-year-old man was discovered at the Condamine River in Warwick. Between 200 and 400mm of rainfall had been recorded over the catchment in the past week. Renewed river rises were occurring downstream of the Loudoun Bridge, expected to remain above 8m at Condamine in the coming days as upstream waters arrived. The Balonne River at Warkon was sitting at 10.03m and rising. Major flooding was also occurring downstream at Weribone. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said on Tuesday lives had been “severely impacted” by the extreme weather event to an extent Queenslanders had never seen before. “Ipswich alone has had some 560 homes and businesses that have been inundated,” she said. “It’s absolutely overwhelming to see people’s lives basically on the streets.”  ",News/Australia news,"Sydney floods: mother and son found dead as Manly Dam spills, bridge inundated and NSW roads closed ",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/08/sydney-floods-nsw-evacuation-orders-flood-manly-dam-spills-roseville-bridge-inundated-road-closures-flooding
