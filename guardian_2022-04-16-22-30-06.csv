4/16/2022,"The lawyers working with more than 75 former rugby league players to take legal action against the Rugby Football League – as well as 175 former rugby union players in a similar action – believe that more than 400 players across both codes have died early due to neurological defects from playing the game and have reiterated the need for the league to make “substantive, immediate changes” to prevent further players from suffering the same. A group including the former Great Britain international Bobbie Goulding have launched a lawsuit against rugby league’s governing body over what they say is a failure to protect them adequately from the risks of brain damage caused by concussive and sub-concussive injuries. Richard Boardman of Rylands Legal, who is leading the actions against both codes, described the issue as an epidemic and said that each week more and more players are reaching out to join the lawsuit against the RFL, which is still in its pre-action phase and is some way from reaching a conclusion, the Observer understands. “There’s been a couple more this week alone,” Boardman said. “It comes in dribs and drabs because some guys feel an allegiance to the sport and that it’s an attack on the game. However, we firmly believe it’s not an attack and that we’re simply trying to help players who are struggling in retirement with brain damage. What’s certain is that there are hundreds, if not thousands, of current and former rugby players in a bad way across the United Kingdom and the wider rugby world. It is an absolute epidemic.” Boardman stressed it was a “certainty” people are dying early due to the conditions and issues they developed while playing rugby. “We believe 400-plus rugby players across both codes, whether that’s elite or amateur, have died prematurely in the last decade or so, due to things related to brain damage and playing the sport,” he continued. There have been growing calls for rugby league to introduce mandatory limits on contact in training to minimise the risks of current and future players developing the same issues as Francis Maloney, who this past week revealed he had been diagnosed with early onset dementia and probable CTE. Boardman believes that is an absolute must. “This is an urgent, immediate problem and it’s why substantive changes need to be made right now,” he said. “Since September when we first contacted the RFL, they’ve already changed numerous things in an attempt to make the game safer for current players, including extending the return to play following a concussion from six days to the relatively safer 11. “In both codes of rugby, training is largely unregulated and if you’ve got a coach getting his players to do two to four days of full-contact training plus a game on top of that each week over a nine-month season, your average player is retiring with hundreds of thousands of concussions or sub-concussions. I don’t think the sport can sustain the way it’s going like that, medium- or long-term.” The RFL has previously said in reaction to reports of the case: “Rugby league is a contact sport and while there is an element of risk to playing any sport, player welfare is always of paramount importance. As a result of scientific knowledge, the sport of rugby league continues to improve and develop its approach to concussion, head injury assessment, education, management and prevention across the whole game.”",Sport/Sport,"More than 400 ex-rugby players died early from brain injuries, claim lawyers",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/16/more-than-400-ex-rugby-players-died-early-from-brain-injuries-claim-lawyers
4/16/2022,"Perhaps, if one day Adele was free to make more experimental music, she would sound something like November Ultra, a Parisian singer-songwriter with a marvellously expressive voice that glides serenely over a mixture of offbeat ballads and darkly dramatic confessionals. Nova grew up in France with a Spanish mother and Portuguese father and has been singing since she was three, when her grandfather taught her how to sing in the Spanish romantic narrative tradition copla, as well as 60s musical songs. Add to that a love of Frank Ocean – whose legendary Nostalgia, Ultra mixtape inspired her name – a proficiency in professional songwriting for acts such as Jaden Smith, and Nova’s intensely vivacious personality, and you get her fascinating debut, Bedroom Walls. Her breakthrough song Soft & Tender is sung in English with smatterings of Spanish and French, as Nova finds her home languages too exposing to sing in all the time. It’s taken three years to corral “a big bowl of emotions and mess” into this album, and now she has to get her head around touring it as well. “It’s like a first date every concert,” she says. “Butterflies! You feel everything. We realise how precious it is, and how much we missed it.” November Ultra’s debut album, Bedroom Walls, is out now via Virgin Records France.

4/16/2022,"The War on Drugs are a band made up of visible mechanisms and processes, like a giant skeleton watch or widescreen MRI scan. Tonight, the band’s linchpin, singing guitarist Adam Granduciel, lurches around inside a citadel of effects pedals, long hair swinging, shirt flapping, guitar pealing in the style of Neil Young. The encore of this two-hour show climaxes in a strobing cover of Young’s Like a Hurricane, with Granduciel swinging his guitar around his head in jubilation at the close. When he sings, however, his phrasings betray an even greater affection for Bob Dylan. And that’s before you drill down into the War on Drugs’s lyrics. Just on the title track alone of Granduciel’s latest album, 2021’s sleek, tuneful I Don’t Live Here Anymore, the singer calls himself “a creature void of form” – a quotation from Dylan’s Shelter from the Storm – then recalls when “we danced to Desolation Row”. All that homage is as nothing, however, to the tributes paid to Bruce Springsteen and his E Street Band by War on Drugs’s jubilant keyboards – played chiefly by Robbie Bennett – and Jon Natchez’s blaring saxophone; plus the 80s thwack of Charlie Hall’s drum kit (multi-instrumentalists Anthony LaMarca and Eliza Hardy Jones, and bassist Dave Hartley, complete the lineup). Granduciel’s lyrics, too, have long tussled with the darkness at the edge of self, with anxiety, lack of certainty and romantic loss played out against an American landscape of rivers and roads, memories and dreams. His firstborn is, of course, named Bruce. To call Granduciel unoriginal, though, would be to miss the point of the War on Drugs, an experiment gone right. This band’s dad-rock dog-whistles and rock canon Easter eggs have been spectacularly effective, calling several generations to him, catapulting this scruffy guitar obsessive from tiny clubs to arenas in the space of a decade. “We played this song at [London’s 500-capacity] Corsica Studios maybe 10 years ago,” notes Granduciel at the start of the rousing Come to the City from 2011’s Slave Ambient, the record that raised his tousled, bleary head above the slacker rock parapet. He was signed by Atlantic, a major label; around the same time, producer-mogul Jimmy Iovine saw no reason why the War on Drugs could not be a “gigantic” win-win all round. Even if the nosebleed seats are curtained off tonight, this is the band’s second time at the O2 since Granduciel’s outfit won the best rock album Grammy for their 2017 album, A Deeper Understanding. But it’s hard to imagine the affable Granduciel as some retromaniac evil genius, tenting his fingers, plotting his assault on the stadium circuit. His obsessiveness and sincerity are very much part of the allure of the War on Drugs, while his personal struggles act as a prism through which all of his influences pass. His rock is not muscular, but questioning. “Am I more than just a fool?” he wonders typically on An Ocean in Between the Waves, where the undeniable pep of the band’s rhythm section is offset by the languor of Granduciel’s guitar. Even at arena scale, he actually leaches the bombast out of Springsteen, excises the archness of Dylan and cinches in the girth of Young’s noodling. Natchez’s sax is a rhythm instrument, rather than a lead, adding texture to the warm thrum and enveloping oscillations of this immersive band. In recompense for all those edits, Granduciel adds in a wistful haziness and a sore but beating heart, worn on a frayed sleeve. His emotional arc could just about be squeezed into a pair of back-to-back tracks that take this gig to its climax. Under the Pressure, one of the standouts from his 2014 breakthrough album, Lost in the Dream, documents the merciless death throes of a relationship; the screens either side of the stage show Granduciel’s worn boot about to stamp on an effects pedal as the band go up to 11. Immediately after is I Don’t Live Here Anymore, in which he bids farewell to being “so afraid of everything” and embraces “a chance to be reborn”; the melody nags at you all the way home. This is a very good show that could have been an even greater one, however. If Granduciel were to carve a musician’s version of Mount Rushmore, those granite busts of Young, Dylan and Springsteen would be joined by far less famous foreign interlopers: Michael Rother and Klaus Dinger from the German outfit Neu!, a band in whose sleek propulsion Granduciel found an obvious but inspired analogue with the freedom of the highway in American heartland rock. He salutes Neu!’s sister outfit, Harmonia, through a song called Harmonia’s Dream, and it is inarguably the highest point in the War on Drugs set. A long run-up of blooping analogue keyboards and mesmerising lights erupts into a pulsating workout, which, over the course of many delicious minutes, combines the highway, the autobahn and the dancefloor, threatening to turn this arena rock show into a rave. It may be a European perspective, but this is the War on Drugs’ sweetest spot. It’s a shame they don’t press it till it’s sore.",Arts/Music,"The War on Drugs review – wistful, immersive rock turned up to 11",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/16/the-war-on-drugs-o2-london-live-review-adam-granduciel
4/16/2022,"The Ross 308 is one of the most successful products in consumer history, with many tens of billions sold around the world over the last decade. With its own 15-page performance manual, low production costs and a bargain price for shoppers, it is marketed as the world’s most popular meat chicken. Owned by the global breeding firm Aviagen, the Ross 308 has been bred to reach its kill weight in just 35 days, growing more than three times faster than the conventional breeds of the 1950s. While families across the country gather this weekend, the Ross 308 will be an affordable option for the Easter Sunday roast. A whole chicken can be bought for as little as £2.46. Animal welfare campaigners claim the cost of such low-priced meat is being paid for by the chickens, which grow so fast their hearts and bone structures can struggle to cope. They want retailers to stop selling the Ross 308 and the Cobb 500, the Uk’s other main fast-growing breed, citing research showing these chickens had higher mortality, lameness and muscle disease than slower-growing breeds. But the poultry industry warned this weekend that adopting slower-growing breeds could increase the price of a standard chicken by more than 30% at a time when consumers face a cost of living crisis. This puts meat chickens – known in the industry as broilers – at the centre of one of the biggest animal welfare battles since the 2012 ban on barren battery cages for hens. There are now 325 retailers and firms in the UK and Europe, including Marks & Spencer, Waitrose, KFC and Premier Foods, which have signed up to the Better Chicken Commitment, the international initiative to phase out the use of fast-growing breeds, which campaigners call “Frankenchickens”. The commitment requires companies to adopt slower-growing breeds by 2026, including some produced by Aviagen, with higher welfare outcomes and reduced stocking density. All the major food supermarkets in France have signed up to the commitment. The Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs said in February that one of its welfare priorities was to implement the commitment. However, most of the major supermarkets in the UK, including Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Asda, are yet to sign up to the pledge and there is concern among campaigners that the cost of living crisis may be used to stall the campaign. The environment secretary, George Eustice, warned last month that the price of chicken could rise significantly because of higher energy costs and feed prices affected by war in Ukraine. Campaigners say poultry has been produced too cheaply and farmers need to be paid more to ensure better conditions for the meat chickens. On the modern food plate, the chicken can be cheaper than chips. A 1.4kg Willow Farm whole chicken in Tesco costs just £2.89 (£2.07 per kg), compared to a 1.6kg bag of McCain home chips costing £3.50 (£2.19 per kg). Connor Jackson, chief executive of the animal welfare group Open Cages, which has conducted covert investigations into broiler farms, said: “It’s very sad that these animals’ lives have become worth so little. We call them Frankenchickens. The science is clear that fast-growing chickens like the Ross 308 are doomed by their genetics. These have been engineered to grow so incredibly fast, and their bodies just cannot handle it.” Jackson said secret filming at broiler farms supplying big supermarkets has shown birds struggling to walk or collapsing under their own weight, or dying from heart failure, and dead birds were filmed lying among the flocks. Chicken producers say they are committed to animal welfare and the overwhelming majority of birds are clean and healthy. The modern broiler industry expanded in the US and Britain after the second world war. Large-scale breeding firms used genetic selection to produce birds with faster growth rates, efficient conversion of feed to muscle growth and a higher yield of breast meat. More than 1.1 billion broilers are produced each year in the UK, with the Ross 308 the most popular brand. Millions are reared on farms which can house more than 200,000 birds. A 2019 study by Aarhus University in Denmark and Wageningen University in the Netherlands found a Ross 308 took 32 days to reach 1.8kg compared to a broiler developed from 1957 commercial meat chicken, which took more than 100 days to reach the same weight. The fast-growing breeds are helping to provide a cheap and plentiful supply of meat, but in recent years research has highlighted animal welfare concerns. A report by the RSPCA in March 2020 found the fast-growing broilers had significantly higher mortality (including culls), a greater risk of being lame and were more affected by the breast muscle diseases wooden breast and white striping. The report said: “Although current genetic selection programmes may be justified by some on the basis they result in an animal that provides a cheap, efficient source of meat and protein, there is no acceptable justification when such programmes have serious inherent flaws and are associated with poor health and welfare.” Andrew Knight, a professor of animal welfare and ethics at the University of Winchester, said: “With these really rapid growth rates, it can be difficult for the heart and circulatory system to keep up with the expanding body mass. A proportion of these animals suffer from heart failure. It’s also difficult for the bones, ligaments and tendons to keep up with the rapidly increasing body mass, meaning that a proportion of these birds become severely lame.” The animal welfare charity the Humane League UK unsuccessfully sought a judicial review against the government over the production of fast-growing chickens, which it considers is in breach of the 2007 welfare of farmed animals regulations, which state animals can only be farmed if they can be kept “without any detrimental effect on their health or welfare”. The charity said last week it intends to appeal. Richard Griffiths, chief executive at the British Poultry Council, said farmers needed healthy chicken, but considered fast-growing breeds like the Ross 308 could be reared with good animal welfare. He said there were concerns about the pace of growth, but improved farming technology and breeding were making a difference and the adoption by the industry of slower growing breeds and reduced stocking density would have a significant environmental impact, because this woud require more feed and more space. But it could also increase the price of fresh chicken by more than 30%. “We are a dynamic industry and we respond to consumer demand, but there are several factors involved including a cost of living crisis.” Rob Morton, 49, of Morton’s Family Farm in Norfolk, rears the slower-growing Hubbard JA787 chicken for the Christmas market and hopes to expand production year round. “It makes a better-tasting bird because they have time to mature.” A British Retail Consortium spokesperson said supermarkets offered customers affordable choices at high standards, including those in the Better Chicken Commitment: “All major UK supermarkets take their responsibilities to animal welfare very seriously.” A spokesperson for Aviagen, which has its headquarters in Alabama, in the US, said: “Our first priority is and has always been the welfare of our birds. Welfare characteristics are a major part of modern broiler breeding, and are among the absolutely top selection priorities for all of our breeds we supply.” The spokesperson said the company bred a range of birds to suit different requirements including the Better Chicken Commitment. Dr Tracey Jones, director of food business at Compassion in World Farming, said last week it was possible to implement the Better Chicken Commitment despite rising food prices. “It is going to be difficult, but we need to be eating less meat. We could then perhaps afford to pay for better-quality chicken.”",News/World news,Cheaper than chips … ‘Frankenchicken’ at the centre of fight for animal welfare,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/16/cheaper-than-chips-frankenchicken-at-the-centre-of-fight-for-animal-welfare

4/16/2022,"Child poverty is bad. I think we can all agree on that, right? Americans are divided on lots of issues but it’s reasonable to suppose that, no matter where someone sits on the political spectrum, they would want kids to have enough to eat. Right? Wrong. As it turns out an awful lot of politicians have no issue at all with kids going hungry. Last year the federal government lifted millions of American children out of poverty with the stroke of a pen when it expanded the Child Tax Credit (CTC) as part of the American Recovery Plan. There was nothing particularly revolutionary about this policy: lots of rich countries provide some version of a universal child benefit. But, while it wasn’t revolutionary on a global scale, the CTC transformed the US: monthly child poverty was slashed by roughly 30%. About 3.7 million children saw their lives improve. And then, at the end of 2021, the CTC expired and congress failed to extend it. Those 3.7 million kids went hungry again; a February study found that child poverty increased by 41% in after the program expired. In short: a wildly successful policy that improved millions of people’s lives was simply chucked away. Republicans – the party that loves loudly proclaiming how “pro-life” they are and how much they care about family values – are largely to blame for the CTC expiring. Every single Republican in congress opposed extending the CTC. Joe Manchin, a supposed Democrat, also helped kill the program; he reportedly told colleagues that he worried that parents would waste the money they were being given on drugs. Did he have any evidence for this? No, of course not. In fact, studies show that 91% of households making less than $35,000 a year used the money to pay for food, shelter, clothing and other necessities. While Republicans and Manchin bear the bulk of the responsibility for sabotaging the CTC, there’s plenty of blame to go around. The fact that much of the media insists on describing Manchin as a “moderate”, for example, doesn’t help matters. Terminology like this helps push the idea that bowing to corporate interests is “moderate’ while helping pull kids out of poverty is “radical”; it makes it easier for people like Manchin to pretend they’re being sensible instead of just selfish. And the Democrats are hardly blameless either. They’re absurdly bad at messaging and often seem to care more about compromising with their colleagues across the aisle instead of fighting for ordinary Americans. The short-lived CTC reveals one of the big lies in politics: the idea that it’s far too difficult to do anything about big problems like poverty. As the brief success of the CTC demonstrates, simply giving families a little more money pays massive dividends. We know how to make people’s lives better, we just lack the political will to do so. The navy and air force bought more than 30,000 pills but claimed the drug was being used to treat pulmonary hypertension, which is … hard to believe. Frank Nicely, a Tennessee state senator, tried to rally support for a bill that critics say would criminalize homelessness by delivering a completely unhinged and unsolicited history lesson. “For two years, Hitler lived on the streets and practiced his oratory and body language and how to connect with the masses and then went on to lead a life that got him in the history books,” Nicely said. It seems that Republican lawmaker are in intense competition to see who can be most deranged. There’s an initiative in the UK called Homes for Ukraine which lets anyone with a spare room open their homes to Ukrainians fleeing war. Which is very nice except that a bunch of perverts are using it to prey on vulnerable women: a recent undercover investigation by the Times found that some British men were asking Ukranian women to share their beds. The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) has now asked the UK government to review the scheme. The latest dystopian idea from a government riddled with corruption and devoid of compassion. A far-right politician wants to give women €4,000 if they don’t get an abortion–a move feminist groups have derided as “manipulative”. Prosecutors have now dropped the outrageous murder charges but abortion advocates worry the case could have a chilling effect on pregnant people seeking medical care in Texas. Recent polling shows that college-educated men have swung Republican by 26 points since 2018; men on the whole have moved towards Republicans by 20 points. “The Republican party’s exploding support among men comes as the organs of rightwing media and many Republican politicians have embraced a vitriolic language of gender grievance,” writes Moira Donegan. Cats have gone wild in a California stadium: the Oakland Coliseum is currently dealing with hordes of feral cats. While they were apparently drafted in to help deal with rodents, the cats have now multiplied. “We can live with the cats,” one of the Coliseum’s directors said. “They do good work.

4/16/2022,"Emmanuel Macron is engaged in the battle of his career to persuade leftwing voters – many of whom have taken to the streets to oppose his government over the past five years – to turn out next Sunday and give him a second term in office. Both Macron and Le Pen need to win over a chunk of the 7.7 million people who voted for the radical left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon, narrowly knocked out in the first-round ballot last week. In the town of Trappes, south-west of Paris, where almost 61% of voters chose Mélenchon, opinion is divided about what to do next. Le Figaro newspaper suggested that “on the presidential motorway, Emmanuel Macron is trying a subtle turn to the left”. But asked what Macron can do to woo the left, the mayor of Trappes, Ali Rabeh, a former member of the Socialist party, turned the question around. “To be honest, it would be better if he shut up because each time he opens his mouth he exasperates our voters, and this encourages them not to vote or to vote blank,” said Rabeh, who campaigned for Mélenchon. “If Macron is going to say something it should be a clear message of compromise, not something vague like perhaps lowering his proposal for retirement at 65 to 64-and-a-half. People aren’t that asleep; that’s just playing with fire.” Mélenchon has advised supporters that “not a single vote should go to Madame Le Pen”, but made it clear that the second-round vote is the equivalent of, as the French say, either “the plague or cholera” for those on the left. Rabeh believes – reluctantly – there is no choice. “Le Pen is in a position to win, and if she does it will be the most vulnerable, the minorities, immigrants, those without papers, who will suffer most. I’m not going to campaign for Macron, but I don’t think we have any choice. We shouldn’t underestimate support for the far right.” Last Sunday saw an unexpected surge for Mélenchon, who finished close behind Le Pen. Almost 22% of voters chose the radical left La France Insoumise (France Unbowed) leader and now feel “politically orphaned”, Rabeh said. Polls suggest 30% of Mélenchon voters might vote Macron, 23% Le Pen, and the rest will abstain or vote blank next Sunday. Trappes, whose most famous residents include actor Omar Sy, footballer Nicolas Anelka and the French comic Jamel Debbouze, has a large immigrant population, many with north African roots. The far right has claimed that the town is a hotbed of religious radicalisation. In February, Jordan Bardella, acting leader of Le Pen’s far-right Rassemblement National, was officially put under investigation for hate speech after describing the town as an “Islamic Republic”. Rabeh, the son of Moroccan immigrants, describes this as unfair stigmatisation. At Trappes market on Friday, Clement Likwengi, 52, a fire safety adviser, said: “People here will never vote for Le Pen for the simple reason that she represents the politics of division. I think people in France forget that Macron has revived the French economy, reduced unemployment and looked after people during the Covid crisis. He’s done the job.” He said he would vote Macron next Sunday and hoped his son, 27, and daughter, 19, who were enthusiastic Mélenchon supporters and were “extremely disappointed” by his defeat, would do the same. Thierry, 59, a builder, who did not want to give his full name, voted Mélenchon in the first round but said he would not support either candidate in the second. “There is nothing Macron can say to me to make me change my mind. He’s already had 10 years in public life, five at the finance ministry and five as president, so we know what he has done and will do. “I will vote, but I will vote blank. Of course, I worry that Le Pen will win, especially for the community here in Trappes, but, as we say, fear will not stop the danger. Hania Maouch, 47, who was shopping with her 16-year-old daughter Ghalia, said her family and friends had voted Mélenchon in the first round. She admitted many were undecided about the second. “We were disappointed about Mélenchon. I think half will vote Macron and half won’t vote at all,” she said. Mélenchon is consulting 315,000 party members to decide a collective response to the question of who to vote for on Sunday. In a letter to supporters he wrote: “The one and the other are not the same.” Manon Aubry, of Mélenchon’s La France Insoumise, told the Observer it was not for the party to direct people how to vote but added: “We know Le Pen is dangerous. If both candidates have a disdain for the working class, she adds a disdain for race; if both offer liberal politics, she adds xenophobia.” Describing Macron as “the least worst”, she added: “We have nothing to negotiate with him. It’s for him to say what he will do to address the anger many feel towards him.” It was this anger that sparked protests at several universities including the Sorbonne and Sciences Po last week, with students shouting “Neither Macron nor Le Pen”. On Friday, a group of elderly men from the Maghreb – sitting in the spring sunshine, chatting near Trappes market – said they had no right to vote in France, but were not particularly worried about the outcome. “Macron will win and life will go on as before,” said one. What about Le Pen’s threat to deport foreigners? “She says that, but it’s not going to happen,” he added. Rabeh fears this nonchalance is deeply misplaced. “Unfortunately, I think we’re just going to have to pinch our noses and vote for Macron.”",News/World news,Macron and Le Pen battle to win over ‘politically orphaned’ French voters,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/16/france-election-macron-le-pen
4/16/2022,"A marine biologist held by police for more than 48 hours over a climate crisis protest was taken from her cell to hospital in an ambulance. Emma Smart, 44, one of nine scientists affiliated with Extinction Rebellion who were arrested at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), had gone on hunger and thirst strike to protest against the conditions in which she was being held. She was being kept in a basic windowless cell lit constantly with fluorescent light. While the other eight scientists were released on bail on Thursday, police said they would hold Smart until she could appear in court on Saturday because she had a record of breaking bail conditions. On Friday night, police called an ambulance to Charing Cross police station to take Smart to hospital. According to her supporters, she was keen not to waste hospital resources and accepted rehydration treatment, then was taken back into police custody. She was released on Saturday after appearing at Westminster magistrates court. Smart was one of a group of 25 scientists who protested at the BEIS building in Westminster on Wednesday. They pasted poster-sized pages from climate science papers on to the glass facade, and some, including Smart, glued their hands to the window and used spray chalk to daub extinction symbols on the glass. The Metropolitan police said she had been charged with criminal damage. The force said: “Smart was arrested at the scene and charged the following day. She was remanded in custody to appear at Westminster magistratescourt at the first opportunity. Due to the courts being closed on bank holidays, the date of that appearance is Saturday 16 April. “Decisions regarding bail are taken on a case-by-case basis and consider a range of matters including, but not limited to, whether there is a risk to the public or the person detained, the likelihood of someone not complying with any bail conditions or absconding and any previous history of offending while on bail. “Whilst people are in custody, officers have a duty of care for their welfare and will ensure the medical needs of all detainees are considered. Healthcare professionals are available to each custody suite.” On Friday, Peter Kalmus, the Nasa climate scientist who has taken part in scientists’ climate crisis protests in the US, offered his support to Smart and called on others to join civil disobedience protests. “My heart goes out to Emma, she’s in the next level of risk. I’m grateful for what she’s doing and I hope that the world starts to support her,” Kalmus said. “The best way to support Emma is to start taking civil disobedience actions yourself. Because as more and more of us start to take these sorts of actions, the risk for all of us starts to decrease. “To the governments that are imprisoning Emma and are trying to shut down this kind of protest: you’re on the wrong side of history and it’s absolutely clear now.” Smart has a history of environmental activism, having taken part in high-profile protests with Insulate Britain.",News/UK news,Hunger-striking XR activist taken from police cell to hospital,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/16/hunger-striking-xr-activist-police-cell-hospital-extinction-rebellion
