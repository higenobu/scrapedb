3/18/2022,"Hong Kong has recorded 5,000 Covid deaths and is expected to pass 1 million cases among its population of 7.5 million – so how did the situation become so bad? Hong Kong is in the grip of its worst Covid outbreak. The surge in infections during the fifth wave has outpaced other cities around the world. Analysis of government data by Hong Kong Free Press showed there were almost 900 confirmed infections per 100,000 Hong Kong citizens in early March, when cases peaked. The all-time high for the pandemic was previously held by New York City, with 500 cases per 100,000 residents, in January. University of Hong Kong virologist Vijaykrishna Dhanasekaran said one factor behind the high rate was Hong Kong’s “high-density population and cramped spaces, especially in public housing estates”. The city’s public healthcare system has also buckled under Omicron, with devastating effects. Patients were left to wait outside hospitals while bodies stacked up inside wards. Eventually, Omicron entered elderly care homes and found a particularly vulnerable portion of the population, all the more so because of the low vaccination rate among the city’s senior citizens. Before the fifth wave, Hong Kong had reported a total of 212 coronavirus-related deaths. Now it is recording above that amount daily. Virologist Siddharth Sridhar at Hong Kong University’s Department of Microbiology said Hong Kong’s Covid-19 death rate – among the worst in the world – was “tragic but expected”, pinning it on a “perfect storm” of low vaccination rates among elderly people, low rates of prior infection and an overwhelmed healthcare system. Dhanasekaran said: “The data is really clear … Most people who end up in hospitals are not vaccinated, most people who are in severe conditions are elderly. It is really clear what has gone amiss.” Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, has acknowledged that the city’s vaccination rate played a role. Currently, 81% of those aged 12 and over have received two doses of the vaccines available in Hong Kong – the Chinese-made Sinovac, a traditional inactivated vaccine, and BioNTech, an mRNA vaccine produced in Germany. However, that figure drops to almost 56% among those aged 80 and above. Mistrust of the authorities after months of pro-democracy protests, arrests and an ensuing national security law crackdown have also been blamed for the low vaccine uptake, as well as an over-emphasis on potential side effects. Government data shows Sinovac to be the preferred vaccine among those aged 70 and over, despite several studies indicating it is less effective – particularly against Omicron – than the BioNTech vaccine. That could be, in part, because some elderly care homes offer only the Sinovac jab to residents. According to Dhanasekaran, Sinovac “has been shown to work really well in many countries” against earlier strains of the virus, although it was “not as effective as the BioNTech [jab]”. Dhanasekaran said: “Having some vaccines is better than no vaccines”, adding that “Sinovac is not really the biggest issue here – the low vaccination rate is absolutely the problem.” Mainland China is battling a number of Omicron outbreaks that have seen almost 30 million people locked down. The governor of north-eastern Jilin province, the current centre of China’s infections, vowed to “achieve community zero-Covid in a week”, state media reported on Monday.But in a sign that thousands of Omicron infections might be forcing a more dynamic approach from authorities, China approved the use of rapid antigen tests last Sunday – a first in the country, which has relied exclusively on nucleic acid tests to confirm Covid patients. Hong Kong made a similar pivot at the end of February, when laboratories were unable to process the sheer number of specimens from nucleic acid tests coming in, causing huge backlogs in cases being reported. In mainland China, about 50% of those aged 80 and above are fully vaccinated. At present, only Chinese-made vaccines have been approved for use in the mainland, none of which are mRNA jabs.Xi Chen, a health and development economist at Yale’s school of public health, recently tweeted a series of Financial Times charts highlighting Hong Kong’s death rate against countries with higher elderly vaccination rates. He captioned it: “A picture is worth a thousand words. A warning message to Chinese mainland.” China has yet to report a surge in deaths related to its latest wave of infections, but experts agree that the country’s zero-Covid policy remains on a knife-edge. University of Oxford epidemiologist Chen Zhengmin told Reuters: “The next two weeks are key to determining whether existing policies can really be effective in curbing infection growth or even reaching completely zero cases in one city, as we saw last year.” Published in affiliation with Hong Kong Free Press",News/World news,Hong Kong Covid crisis: why is the death rate so high?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/18/hong-kong-covid-crisis-why-is-the-death-rate-so-high
3/18/2022,"Two of the ABC’s most experienced journalists, Sarah Ferguson and Tony Jones, have been filming in Kyiv in recent days for a Four Corners program, Despair and Defiance, to air on Monday. Also at the ABC, investigative reporter Sean Rubinsztein-Dunlop has been filing from Ukraine in recent days following on from reporting by Nick Dole and Isabella Higgins, Tom Joyner and David Lipson. Seven News chief reporter Chris Reason is one of the few Australian journalists who has been based in the capital Kyiv for several weeks now despite the obvious danger. SBS News chief international correspondent Ben Lewis spent seven weeks in Kyiv before returning to London to see his wife who is in her third trimester of pregnancy. Nine News has also devoted considerable resources to covering the conflict, sending Europe correspondent Carrie-Anne Greenbank in the lead-up to the invasion, and now senior reporter Mark Burrows and US correspondent Amelia Adams are on the ground in Ukraine. Ten News has journalist Ursula Heger filing from Ukraine. Reaso, as Chris Reason is known, told the Weekly Beast he initially went to London to report on the Queen’s illness but he had packed his boots, medical kit and winter gear just in case he needed to be deployed to Ukraine, where colleagues Sarah Greenhalgh and Geoff Parry had been reporting. He has been in Kyiv for four weeks now, along with cameraman Simon Hydzik, fuelled by “borscht and a Nescafé Blend 43 Americano”. “What is happening cannot be covered by remote reporting, it needs eyes on the ground,” Reason told the Weekly Beast. “Independent, free and fair journalism is never more important than in life and death matters like war. Ukraine is crying out for help – and the world is responding.” Reason said he doesn’t count himself as one of the journalists on the real frontline – such as the team that Associated Press has in Mariupol – and the Seven crew is positioned with “multiple exit routes”. A rooftop piece to camera which aired this week on Seven News has stunned audiences. Reason says it was the result of the “genius drone work” of Hydzik. “It’s so difficult to capture the size and scope of a disaster sometimes, but with his equipment (and skill), it was possible,” he said on Friday. “And by doing that, you help deliver into Australian lounge rooms just a fraction of the horror that’s happening over here: the viewer gets to see and feel what it’s like. If we can make someone stop for just a moment and think about the profound sorrow behind this conflict, then we have done our job as a news crew.” When you criticise News Corp Australia you can expect swift retribution, as a former reporter for the Australian, Lanai Scarr, discovered this week. Scarr, the political editor of the West Australian, dared to criticise the Oz for its reporting of domestic abuse in relation to Kumanjayi Walker. Despite softening her criticism by saying the Oz was a “great paper”, Weekly Beast understands Scarr received more than one furious, accusatory email from the Australian. The Australian’s editor-in-chief, Christopher Dore, has defended the paper’s recent coverage, which was labelled a national disgrace by Indigenous journalists. The tone of the coverage has shocked regular readers of the Oz who say the paper’s long-serving Northern Territory correspondent Amos Aikman has a good reputation for covering Indigenous issues, as does the Indigenous affairs correspondent Paige Taylor. The Weekly Beast understands it was no accident Aikman’s byline was nowhere near other reportage that has been criticised as graphic and insensitive. Lawyer and human rights advocate Nyadol Nyuon was appalled when she read in the Weekly Beast last week that Age editor Gay Alcorn was poised to hire Claire Lehmann, the founding editor of rightwing online magazine Quillette. Nyuon, an Age columnist who has been described as “a beacon of light, truth and wisdom” by readers, said the news was her “notice to get out” and announced her intention to leave on Twitter. Many Age and Sydney Morning Herald journalists were also unhappy about management’s decision to approach Lehmann, who has argued that journalists exist in a social and professional “bubble” and are not open to publishing or reading alternative views. Lehmann, who has a regular column in Murdoch’s the Australian and appeared on Q+A last week, has been described as the voice of the “intellectual dark web” for her critique of feminism and the left. With criticism raging on Twitter, some readers cancelled subscriptions. Amid staff anger in newsrooms in Sydney and Melbourne, Alcorn and Sydney Morning Herald editor Bevan Shields sent a memo to staff on Tuesday defending the move as “part of our mission to publish a wide range of views in opinion, and [we] will continue to do so”. “We did talk to Claire and she has decided to stay with the Australian,” Alcorn and Shields told staff of Lehmann’s rebuff. Alcorn told the Weekly Beast that Nyuon “did not speak to us about her concerns” before she tweeted but “she is a beautiful writer and an important voice and we wish her all the best”. When Nine bought Fairfax Media in 2016 the idea was to merge some of the country’s strongest brands to create Australia’s biggest media company. Nine already owned streaming service Stan when it added the mastheads the Age and the Sydney Morning Herald to the group. This week three divisions of Nine Entertainment – print, TV and streaming – teamed up to unveil the first truly multi-platform project, an original documentary slate for Stan: Revealed. Revealed’s first project takes the award-winning reporting of journalist Nick McKenzie, an undercover investigation he did for 60 Minutes on Nazis in Australia, and creates an original feature film directed by Bentley Dean. Amongst Us – Neo Nazi Australia will air on Stan on 27 March. McKenzie, who won two Walkley awards last month for the Nazi story on 60 Minutes, told the Weekly Beast the film is a separate entity. He said there was so much great material that didn’t fit the formula of a 60 Minutes or a Four Corners, and the Stan film has no narrator, more undercover scenes and is beautifully directed by Dean. The Northern Territory may do things differently to the rest of Australia, but for the Sunday Territorian editor, Phillippa Butt, there was one thing she couldn’t abide: Michael Gunner’s mullet. Butt called on the chief minister to “get rid of the mullet”. “We’re trying to be taken seriously,” Butt wrote. “And part of that is dressing appropriately and looking the part.”",News/Media,Reporters deliver ‘a fraction of the horror’ from Ukraine’s war zone to Australia’s lounge rooms | The Weekly Beast,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/18/reporters-deliver-a-fraction-of-the-horror-from-ukraines-war-zone-to-australias-lounge-rooms
