4/18/2022,"Nelson Mandela famously declared that “the true character of society is revealed in how it treats its children”. If this is true, then our country’s soul is in a parlous state indeed. Rishi Sunak’s do-nothing spring statement is set to plunge 150,000 more children into poverty. And despite promising to help families, the chancellor made precisely zero mention of something all families know is in deep crisis: childcare. Almost everyone involved in caring for young children is at breaking point – physically, emotionally, financially. One recent study documented “a strong sense of fatigue and exhaustion” after two years of pandemic disruption: as one parent said, “you start to feel kind of buried under it”. In a survey of mothers by the campaign group Pregnant then Screwed, almost half of respondents had considered quitting their jobs because of childcare issues. The average price of a full-time nursery place for a one-year-old is £14,030 a year – among the most expensive in the world. Small wonder that one in three parents spend more than a third of their entire income on childcare. Indeed, for many it is their single biggest expense – outstripping even the notoriously high cost of housing. One in four respondents to the Pregnant then Screwed survey were even skipping meals or heating to pay for it. Wherever these high costs are going, it’s not into the pockets of childcare workers. The average wage for these essential and highly skilled professionals is £7.42 an hour. Researchers at the University of Leeds tracked their experiences through the pandemic – and their findings make for desperate reading. Dr Kate Hardy, who led the project, tells me it was partly motivated by her own experience as a parent of two preschoolers: her monthly nursery fees amount to £1,600. “To think that the staff are being paid poverty wages while we pay more on childcare than our mortgage is really upsetting.” Working on the frontlines of exposure to the virus, often lacking sick pay or basic protection, and picking up ever-wider responsibilities for the children in their care, staff felt devalued and ignored. Shockingly, more than one in five childminders had resorted to selling personal belongings to make ends meet. Childcare now faces a severe recruitment crisis, with demoralised staff leaving the profession in droves. As one told the researchers: “Whether it’s a school cleaner, dinner lady, Tesco’s, I’m willing to go anywhere now.” The principal culprit for this disaster is government itself. Childcare has been not just neglected, but deliberately starved of funding. Documents released under freedom of information reveal that in England ministers knowingly gave providers of state-funded “free” childcare less than two-thirds of what it actually cost to deliver the service. Never mind that investing in care delivers more than twice as many jobs and more tax revenue than investing in construction. Those in charge knew the shortfall would be met by higher fees and fewer staff – hurting parents, children and childcare workers alike. The documents prove what any parents of toddlers already know. When my son turned three, I naively expected my childcare costs to disappear, since the government promised to fund 30 free hours a week in England – conveniently, exactly how many we needed. But it transpires that, unlike people’s actual jobs, this entitlement only covers term time. Stretched across a year, it shrinks to 22 hours a week. Making up the difference costs £22 a day. And since even those hours aren’t properly funded, the nursery has to find other ways to cover its costs – like charging £16 a day for lunch and snacks. (Call me crazy, but I just don’t think my toddler’s appetite is that gargantuan.) As Hardy says, this segregates and holds back children from low-income families, whose parents simply can’t afford these top-up fees. “We had a woman who can’t use the ‘free’ childcare, because she can’t afford the bus to the nearest nursery that doesn’t charge extra.” Even with extra fees, many settings are struggling to stay afloat. Always the poor cousin of schools, the early years sector was largely abandoned to cope with the demands of Covid as best it could. One in 20 registered providers shut their doors for good in the first year of the pandemic. Most were small independent businesses whose physical or financial reserves had been exhausted. This has left some parents – disproportionately in deprived areas – unable to find childcare at all. Those providers left standing are hiking fees even further in order to survive. Rising costs will undoubtedly push even more over the edge. While this state of affairs has been a catastrophe for some, for others it is a lucrative investment opportunity. Big profit-driven chains – often backed by private equity investors and laden with debt – have snapped up struggling nurseries. Undeterred by the scandalous collapse of care home chains such as Southern Cross, we are now about to repeat the same failed experiment with our children. Yet again, vulnerable children will suffer most – not least those with special educational needs and disabilities, who for investors are not human beings to be nurtured but costs to be minimised. In what universe is this acceptable? By what twisted logic should vulture capitalists be allowed anywhere near babies and toddlers? The solutions to the childcare emergency are not rocket science. Government needs to invest properly in the system and its workers. It should use this investment to ensure high-quality childcare and early years education is available everywhere and to everyone, as essential public infrastructure – just like schools. Instead, it continues to toss inadequate subsidies at parents, let the market decide where and how childcare will be provided, and wash its hands of the consequences. Even when campaigners finally succeeded in forcing childcare costs on to the agenda, ministers’ only response was to suggest cutting regulations – allowing more children to be looked after by fewer staff. This is an idea so mindbogglingly out of touch with reality, it would be laughable if the stakes were not so high. Yet it is somehow grimly predictable that the only solution these people can conceive is to demand even more of workers who are already stretched to their limits. They seem unable to comprehend that the answer is to value care work more, not less. Writing about all this, I struggle to contain my rage. This government has made crystal clear that it does not give a damn about my son’s welfare, let alone the children they have consigned to poverty and isolation. The amazing staff who help us care for him deserve the earth, yet they are paid a pittance while extractive owners are allowed to treat nurseries as cash cows. Mandela was right.

4/18/2022,"Environmental groups have raised concerns about a $500m (£380m) forest protection deal signed by Boris Johnson at Cop26, after a damning report into the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s “lawless” logging sector. Johnson signed the letter of intent on behalf of the Central African Forest Initiative (Cafi) for a 10-year agreement which includes objectives to protect high-value forests and peatlands. Of the £200m committed to protecting the Congo basin by the UK at Cop26, £32m was given to Cafi from the aid budget. At the beginning of April, the DRC government released a long-awaited audit of the country’s logging industry. It found that six successive ministers had illegally allocated at least 18 logging concessions, breaking a near 20-year moratorium on new industrial felling in the world’s second largest rainforest. More than $3m in royalties has not been paid to the government by operators due to a “chaotic situation”, according to the audit, which marks the first step of the deal between the DRC and 12 donors signed on the first day of Cop26 in Glasgow to unlock $500m to protect the vast ecosystem. Environmental groups have said taxpayer money from the UK, Norway, France and Germany could go to waste if no action is taken on the illegal concessions, with the moratorium on industrial logging due to be lifted at the end of this year. The DRC environment ministry issued a review of all forest concession contracts after the audit but environmental groups are demanding suspensions and prosecutions of violations. Known as the lungs of Africa, the Congo basin rainforest is home to endangered forest elephants and gorillas and is an enormous carbon store that sustains rainfall as far away as Egypt and is home to about 80 million people. It absorbs about 4% of the world’s annual carbon emissions. Irene Wabiwa Betoko, Congo basin forest lead for Greenpeace, said: “The audit reveals a circus of illegalities, corruption and crimes against the environment. Greenpeace Africa demands a legal investigation of all officials responsible for plundering the rainforest, and, where necessary, the lifting of their parliamentary immunity.” Despite the ban on new industrial logging, the DRC has one of the highest rates of deforestation in the world, losing 490,000 hectares (1.2m acres) of primary rainforest in 2020, according to Global Forest Watch. Lord Goldsmith, minister for the international environment, visited the region last month after the DRC failed to meet the first step of the Cop26 agreement and publish the audit at the start of January. In a statement, he said his trip was a great opportunity to speak to leaders in one of the most important and biodiversity rich areas of Earth. “The leadership of Congo basin countries at Cop26 was hugely impactful, where big promises were made both by donor countries and Congo basin countries. I am determined that those promises are kept,” he said. Cafi, the coalition of donor countries that made the $500m deal with the DRC, welcomed the release of the audit but said no money had been released yet. In a statement to the Guardian, it commended the publication of the report by the DRC Inspection générale des finances on logging concessions and said it would continue to work in collaboration with the DRC government on strengthening forest governance. “Cafi remains committed to supporting the DRC to help ensure that the objectives and commitments outlined in the 2021-2031 letter of intent are met,” it said.

4/18/2022,"Britain’s economy is at growing risk of falling into a summer recession amid the biggest squeeze on household incomes since the mid 1950s, as soaring inflation curtails consumer spending power, forecasters have warned. Economists said the double blow from slowing post-lockdown growth and rising living costs after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could result in a fall in gross domestic product (GDP) for two consecutive quarters, which is the definition of a recession. Following a weaker than expected growth performance in February, and with the inflation rate reaching the highest levels since 1992 last month, City forecasters said UK GDP was now on track to grow by about 1% in the first quarter of 2022 before slipping into reverse this summer. Analysts said activity would be reduced by an extra bank holiday for the Queen’s platinum jubilee in July, as public holidays usually lead to a drop in overall economic output. The return to lower rates of activity in the health sector after a winter rush to vaccinate people against Covid, as well as households reining in their spending amid the soaring cost of living, are also expected to weigh on growth. James Smith, an economist at the Dutch bank ING, said the economy was likely to shrink in the second quarter. The bank forecasts a 0.3% contraction in the three months to the end of June, followed by growth of just 0.2% in the third quarter. “It’ll be pretty close to a technical recession. Even if one is avoided then we’ll still only see fairly unexciting growth numbers,” Smith said. “If people are spending more money on energy you’d expect some of the non-essentials to fall in sales volumes. That’s what we’ll be watching,” he added. Figures from the Office for National Statistics due on Friday this week are expected to show a fall in retail sales in March as households tighten their belts. It comes as retail industry bosses warn of a slowdown in sales amid the rising cost of living. Neil Shearing, the group chief economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said household disposable income was set to fall by about 1.9% this year. This is bigger than the 1.8% drop in real incomes experienced in 1977, and the biggest since modern records began in the 1950s. “By comparison, real incomes fell by ‘only’ 1.5% in 2011 following the global financial crisis,” he said. “With the economy already close to flatlining, it clearly would not take much to produce a month or two of falling output.” The warnings come after the head of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, said global growth would slow this year and next as the shockwaves from Covid and the war in Ukraine keep inflation higher for longer than first expected. The strength of Britain’s economy will to some extent depend on households who saved during the pandemic continuing to spend. However, while close to £250bn was accumulated during lockdown, most of this was concentrated among wealthier families able to keep working from home, meaning those at most risk from the surging cost of living will feel the biggest pinch. Thomas Pugh, an economist at the accountancy firm RSM UK, said he expected households would probably need to dip into savings or take on debt to protect themselves from rising inflation. “This is a key reason why we think the UK will avoid a recession this year. However, our forecasts suggest GDP growth will average just 0.1% in each of the remaining three quarters of this year – so it would not take much of a rise in oil prices or a disruption in supply chains to push the UK into recession,” he said.",News/Business,"Britain could fall into recession this summer, say experts",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/18/britain-could-fall-into-recession-this-summer-say-experts
4/18/2022,"Photos and a video have emerged purporting to show the Russian cruiser Moskva shortly before the ship sank in the Black Sea. In the images, which have not been independently confirmed, a plume of black smoke is seen rising from the heavily damaged Moskva, which was reported to have been hit by a Ukrainian missile strike last week. The images show that the ship’s lifeboats have been deployed and there are no sailors visible on deck, suggesting the ship may have been abandoned. In the images, the Moskva is listing to port as two fire-hoses shoot streams of water into the air. A three-second video filmed from a nearby ship appears to show a rescue tug approaching the burning Moskva. The short recording ends abruptly as a man nearby yells: “What the fuck are you doing?” Several military analysts consulted by the Guardian said the images looked consistent with the Moskva but that the photographs would require independent confirmation. The source of the photos and the video is unknown and it was first brought to public attention by Osint researchers following the Russian war in Ukraine. “I believe the video is real. What we see shape, size. It is the Moskva,” Yörük Işık, a journalist and expert ship spotter who photographs Russian warships traveling through the Bosphorus , told the Guardian. He said he believed at least one of the photographs was taken from a Project 22870 rescue tugship, of which Russia is believed to have two in the Black Sea. The Moskva was being towed toward the Sevastopol port when it sank, the Russian defence ministry has said. “These tugs are always around whatever the other warships are engaged,” he said in a message. The Russian defence ministry has released very little information about how the ship sank, claiming the damage to the boat was sustained in an accident on board. The Ukrainian government, along with western intelligence officials, say that the ship was hit by several Ukrainian anti-ship missiles. HI Sutton, a naval analyst and author, wrote that the “damage does not rule out a missile strike(s), and it remains the likely cause. Possible puncture marks in the side of the hull are visible below where the fire is. But these would need closer examination to confirm whether they were caused by missiles, or are simply fire damage.” The Russian government claims that the ship sank in “stormy seas” while being towed to the port of Sevastopol. But the location of the fire could suggest that it reached the anti-ship or anti-air missiles, causing a “catastrophic explosion”, Sutton wrote. There had previously been unconfirmed media reports of a large explosion aboard the ship. The Russian government also has not confirmed any information about the number of casualties from the incident, releasing just a short video clip of the Russian Navy’s top brass meeting with some members of the crew. The absence of lifeboats onboard would suggest a considerable number of the crew could have been rescued. “All of the aft life raft canisters have been jettisoned, although one remains on the aft deck,” wrote Sutton. “This suggests that the crew have already abandoned ship at this point.” But other reports in Russian independent media on Monday suggest that up to 200 sailors could have been wounded in the attack on the ship. The ship was reported to have around 500 crew on board.",News/World news,Film and photos appear to show Russian cruiser Moskva shortly before it sank,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/18/film-and-photos-appear-to-show-russian-cruiser-moskva-shortly-before-it-sank
4/18/2022,"The former Australian foreign minister Alexander Downer has appeared front-and-centre of a UK Home Office video promoting the British government’s controversial “new plan for immigration” which includes sending asylum seekers to Rwanda. “Well, basically it’s a racket which is run by people smugglers to make money – and they make huge amounts of money,” Downer says in the video. Downer says it is important to “transmit a message to people smugglers” that no one will end up being able to reside in the UK if they paid a people smuggler. “You can only destroy their model by guaranteeing that people cannot get to the UK courtesy of a smuggler otherwise you can’t destroy their model,” he says. 🌐 Who is profiting from the global migration crisis – and what can be done to help fix it? 👇pic.twitter.com/XaFEfPzkRl The UK home secretary, Priti Patel, announced last week that people seeking asylum in the UK will be flown more than 7,200kms to Rwanda as part of a government crackdown on unauthorised migrants. The plan has triggered criticism, including from Conservative peers and MPs. Downer, who is one of several figures to appear in the video posted online by the Home Office, was foreign affairs minister in the Howard government, which instituted a hardline approach to asylum seekers arriving in Australia by boat. That issue came to a head in August 2001 when a Norwegian freighter, the MV Tampa, rescued 433 asylum seekers from a sinking vessel that had been heading towards Australia’s Christmas Island. The Australian government refused the Tampa permission to land any of the asylum seekers on Australian soil, insisting it wanted to send a message to others to avoid the dangerous journey. When the Tampa anchored off Christmas Island, Australia sent aboard 45 SAS troops, who seized control of the ship. Peter Tinley, second-in-command of the SAS that day, would later report he had found “400-plus ordinary refugees, very hungry, some who needed some medical attention, very scared and uncertain about what was happening [and] a particularly concerned sea captain who just wanted to offload his human cargo and discharge his duty according to international law”. The then prime minister, John Howard, introduced offshore processing of asylum seekers, including in Papua New Guinea and Nauru, and campaigned on the matter in the lead-up to the 2001 election. “We will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come,” Howard said. As foreign minister, Downer repeatedly defended those policies, saying the government was declaring Australia “closed to people smugglers”. He later served as Australia’s high commissioner to the UK from 2014 to 2018. In February this year, the British government appointed Downer to review the country’s border force, months after he urged the UK to adopt Australia’s controversial boat turn-back policy. “My advice to Miss Patel would be to introduce the ‘push-back’ policy without fanfare, and to keep the French informed on a need-to-know basis only,” Downer wrote last year. Unions in Britain condemned Downer’s “deeply concerning” appointment to the review, citing his role in Australia’s “inhumane” immigration policies. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, said on Monday it was important to show “resolve” to people smugglers. Morrison characterised the past arrival of asylum-seeker boats as an “armada”.",News/Australia news,Former Australian foreign minister features in UK video promoting Britain’s ‘new plan for immigration’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/18/former-australian-foreign-minister-features-in-uk-video-promoting-britains-new-plan-for-immigration
4/18/2022,"The British Grand Prix at Silverstone has sold out in the shortest time in the race’s history and is now expected to break all previous attendance records this year. The sales reflect a growing surge in the popularity of Formula One, with race organisers at Silverstone citing an unprecedented demand for tickets, while F1 expect all of its remaining 20 races this year will also sell out. All 142,000 tickets for race day at the British Grand Prix on Sunday 3 July have been sold, which will be a new record attendance. Organisers are expectant that demand for the Friday and Saturday of the race weekend is such that both days could also all be taken up. This would be the first time in the history of the race, which has been on the F1 calendar every year since 1950, all three days will have sold out. If it does the weekend crowd will surpass the record of 356,000 who attended in 2021. “We have experienced unprecedented demand for tickets for the 2022 Formula One British Grand Prix,” said Stuart Pringle, Silverstone’s managing director. “We have never reached a position of sell out so early in the year. “We have increased capacity slightly by adding extra grandstand seats and anticipate our race day crowd to reach 142,000 this year. If sales continue at this pace, we expect to be sold out across all three days.” Silverstone is not the only circuit enjoying the resurgence of interest. F1 believes that all of the remaining 20 races will be held with capacity crowds, including the races in the middle east which do not have broad motorsport audiences, Abu Dhabi and Qatar which is likely to replace the cancelled Russian GP. Last season’s finale in Abu Dhabi attracted 108.7m TV viewers globally while the sport reported a cumulative audience for 2021 of 1.55bn, a 4% increase on the 2020 season. The last round in Melbourne attracted 420,000 fans, Australia’s highest attendance across a weekend sporting event. The race, which took place at 6am UK time returned one of the broadcaster Sky’s highest viewing figures, It averaged at 1.01m, making it the most watched morning F1 race on Sky Sports, an increase of 41% on the Australian GP in 2019 and a higher average than the final round of golf’s Masters garnered that evening. F1 recently announced it would be holding a race in Las Vegas next season and is expected to add Kyalami in South Africa to the calendar in the near future. The US will now host three races in 2023 as the sport expands in the marketplace it has long-wanted to crack. F1’s chief executive, Stefano Domenicali, has stated that the interest in hosting races was such that the sport could easily hold up to 30 meetings a season, although the calendar is currently capped at 24. The interest is in part due to the success of the Netflix series Drive To Survive. Equally however, F1 is also reaping the benefit of the concerted effort owners Liberty Media have made to attract a new, younger audience since taking over the sport in 2017. The sport has enjoyed a huge increase in interest in its digital platforms into which F1 has poured considerable effort and expense to try and reach a younger and wider demographic. Given they were starting almost from scratch the figures would always be on an upward curve but the scale and speed has nonetheless been surprising. There has been exponential growth in social media engagement, with numbers making F1 the fastest growing major sport globally. Across its platforms the sport reached 49.1m followers in 2021. Motorsportbroadcasting.com reports that F1’s Youtube channel, which shows highlights of races, reflects these efforts and the engagement it is now generating.

4/18/2022,"Arthur Conan Doyle’s sinister tale of a diabolical canine curse that claims the weakhearted Baskerville clan may not, on the face of it, seem conducive to a comical makeover. But that is exactly what it gets in Steven Canny and John Nicholson’s adaptation, originally created for the comedy theatre troupe Peepolykus in 2007. Revived by Original Theatre Company and Bolton’s Octagon theatre, and filmed at the Belgrade theatre in Coventry earlier this year, it is as far removed from Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee’s terror-filled 1959 Hammer movie as could be, and yet its transformation works surprisingly well. There is delightfully playful characterisation and good tweaks to the original plot. The play comes with meta-theatrical baubles too, the drama being self-consciously constructed by the actors on stage. This brings its own humour: at one point, the first half is quickly recapped after the actors apparently receive a hostile tweet during the interval. The play within a play elements are funny but sometimes protracted and in these instances it feels as if the drama is indulging in its own ingenuity. At almost two hours, the meta comedy comes to feel a little repetitive and circuitous. There is the added novelty of a cast of just three, which comes with some very nifty costume changes. Part of the joy of this production is the energy and agility that the actors bring. Jake Ferretti is a tongue-in-cheek Sherlock Holmes, Serena Manteghi plays Sir Henry Baskerville as her main role and Niall Ransome is Dr Watson, though all three double and triple-up as every other character in the story. Each is charming and characterful in a different way, with Manteghi taking on an extraordinary number of smaller roles and bringing physical comedy to them all. Dynamically directed by Tim Jackson, there are minimal props and the sound design by Andy Graham builds the scene and atmosphere instead, with the growls of an off stage hound alongside the clop of horses, birdsong and other sound effects. The comedy drains the story of its terror and tension, instead bringing warmth and gentle laughs, but also some slower moments. The actors maintain their energy until the end, though, and the show bursts with imagination, intelligence and twinkling irreverence. There is no recourse to cliche either; we never hear the words “Elementary, my dear Watson” – all for the better.

4/18/2022,"He is a Chinese superstar, a piano virtuoso who has sold millions of albums worldwide and regularly topped the classical charts. Lang Lang has also used his fame and fortune to help state schools that lack music, sounding warnings at a 2019 awards ceremony in London that such lessons had become “a real challenge” for children in the most disadvantaged communities. Now he is bringing music to British state schools in an ambitious project that will set up state-of-the-art “piano labs” across the nation. Each lab will have 20 to 30 keyboards. The scheme is inspired by his programmes in the US and China, in which he has invested tens of millions of pounds. In the US, he has set up piano labs in 86 schools, giving 70,000 kids access to keyboards. In China, he has installed them in 104 schools, enabling 110,000 children to make music. This is primarily for pupils aged seven to 12. The first UK school to benefit is the Winns primary school in Waltham Forest, London’s 12th most-deprived borough, where 53% of residents are from a minority ethnic background. It will receive 30 keyboards within the next few weeks. Every lab is accompanied by a curriculum created by the Royal Conservatory of Music of Toronto and Lang Lang, with ongoing teacher-training, grants and headphones, allowing group piano classes. Lang Lang, who is on a world tour, is a virtuoso who performs with the world’s top orchestras. He has more than 20 million followers across social media and his album Piano Book became 2019’s biggest-selling classical album worldwide, attracting more than 170m streams. Believing that music “heals, unites and inspires, and it makes us better people”, he has dedicated himself to education through the Lang Lang International Music Foundation and his Keys of Inspiration curriculum programme. Asked what inspired him to support UK schools, he told the Guardian: “We were able to identify many similarities between state schools in the UK and public schools in the US in terms of the way access to music and arts can be extremely limited when budgets are cut … I was so surprised by how music classes are never a guarantee. The schools and teachers are incredible, and are so dedicated to providing their students with everything they can. But it shocked me how access to music education can be so limited.” His foundation quotes the Greek philosopher Aristotle: “Music has the power of producing a certain effect on the moral character of the soul, and if it has the power to do this, it is clear that the young must be directed to music and must be educated in it.” Oli Rose, the foundation’s global development director, said all the evidence showed that music could transform young lives, directly affecting behaviour, general mood and self-confidence, adding: “We’ve seen how powerful the programme can be.” In an online video, George Young, the principal of the Arthur Tappan school in New York, says Lang Lang’s programme has had an “enormous, positive effect”, with one 10-year-old boy describing the piano lab as “like a gift from God”, adding: “It keeps me out of trouble.” Rose said they were officially registering as a charity in the UK before “going full steam ahead”.“We’ve got very high ambitions,” he added. While the Department for Education has argued that it invested more than £620m on diverse music and arts education programmes between 2016 and 2021, Mary Mycroft, the head of Waltham Forest music services, spoke of her hope that lives would be enhanced through Lang Lang’s support She said: “Current funding challenges have meant that more and more schools and families are struggling to support young people to fully experience a meaningful musical education.” Lang Lang said: “When I visit our partner schools and see the joy on the students’ faces or hear from our teachers about the progress students are making, I’m reminded of why we created this programme – to give children an opportunity to discover what they’re capable of achieving and to lift up their voices through music.”",News/Education,Chinese virtuoso Lang Lang to set up ‘piano labs’ in UK schools,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/18/chinese-virtuoso-lang-lang-to-set-up-piano-labs-in-uk-schools
