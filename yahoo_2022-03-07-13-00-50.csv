3/7/2022,"Sberbank PJSC said it’s looking at the possibility of issuing cards using Russian payments system Mir and China’s UnionPay after Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. suspended operations following the invasion of Ukraine. The move could allow Russians to make some payments overseas, with UnionPay operating in 180 countries and regions. Visa and Mastercard said that any transactions initiated with their cards issued in Russia will no longer work outside the country from March 10. Cards issued by domestic banks will continue to work in Russia using its payment system. Russia’s biggest lender, Sberbank, said it would announce timescales later. Visa and Mastercard have joined the list of international companies suspending activities in Russia in response to President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The move further isolates Russia’s economy. Cards issued outside of Russia won’t work at ATMs or merchants inside the country, the firms said. Russia’s largest non-state lender, Alfa-Bank JSC, is already working on offering cards with UnionPay. State-owned UnionPay is the provider of most card payments in China. UnionPay did not immediately respond to emails and phone calls outside of normal office hours. Tinkoff Bank said it currently isn’t issuing such cards, but will start to do so as it’s soon as possible. Raiffeisen Bank International AG’s Russian business said on its website that it was considering the problem. The Bank of Russia is also temporarily reducing the amount of information commercial banks are required to publish in an effort to limit the risks from international sanctions. Starting with statements for February, banks will no longer have to release accounts prepared to national standards or make any additional disclosures on their websites, the central bank said in a statement. The central bank of Russia advised its citizens to use cash abroad. It said Mir cards could also be used in Turkey, Vietnam, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and the breakaway territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.

3/7/2022,"By Guy Faulconbridge and Karin Strohecker LONDON (Reuters) -Russia said on Sunday that sovereign bond payments will depend on sanctions imposed by the West over the invasion of Ukraine, raising the spectre of its first major default on foreign bonds since the years following the 1917 Bolshevik revolution. Russia's finance ministry said it would service and pay sovereign debts in full and on time but that payments could be hampered by the international sanctions. ""The actual possibility of making such payments to non-residents will depend on the limiting measures introduced by foreign states in relation to the Russian Federation,"" the finance ministry said in a statement. That raises the possibility of a technical default on debt by Russia after much of its $640 billion in reserves were frozen by the West after President Vladimir Putin ordered what Russia describes as a special military operation in Ukraine on Feb. 24. From now on, Russia will use roubles to make payments to residents on bonds denominated in foreign currency, the ministry said. The finance ministry in Moscow also explicitly said that Russia might not be able to make bond payments because of restrictions imposed by the Russian government. Russia in 1998 defaulted on $40 billion in domestic debt and devalued the rouble under President Boris Yeltsin because it was effectively bankrupt after the Asian debt crisis and falling oil prices shook confidence in its short-term rouble debt. This time, Russia has the money but can't pay because the reserves - the world's fourth largest - that Putin ordered be built up for just such a crisis are frozen by the United States, European Union, Britain and Canada. It could be Russia's first major debt default in more than a century. Even when the Soviet Union collapsed, Russia assumed its foreign debt. In 1918 Bolshevik revolutionaries under Vladimir Lenin repudiated Tsarist debt, shocking global debt markets because Russia then had one of the world's biggest foreign debt piles. With the bonds worth nothing, some holders of the Tsarist notes used them as wallpaper. The Soviet Union under Josef Stalin stopped servicing loans to the United States and Sweden after World War Two. RUSSIAN DEFAULT While Russia has only $40 billion in international bonds outstanding across 15 dollar or euro-denominated issues, its corporates have built up vastly more foreign debt. The eurobonds have been issued with a mix of terms and indentures. Notably, bonds sold after Russia was sanctioned over its 2014 annexation of Crimea contain a provision for alternative currency payments in dollars, euros, British pounds or Swiss francs, with the rouble listed as an alternative currency option for bonds issued since 2018. On March 16 Russia is due to pay $107 million in coupons across two bonds, though it has a 30-day grace period to make the payments. The next full 'principal' repayment is a $359 million 2030 bond on March 31 and then a larger $2 billion maturity on April 4. Russian gas giant Gazprom has a $1.3 billion dollar bond due for repayment on March 7. According to JPMorgan, the OFZ bond market totalled 15.5 trillion roubles, or about $200 billion at January rouble rates, with foreigners holding a little less than a fifth of the bonds. Earlier on Sunday, Moody's cut Russia's credit rating to Ca, the second-lowest rung of its ratings ladder, citing central bank capital controls that are likely to restrict payments on the country's foreign debt and lead to default. Moody's said its decision was driven by ""severe concerns over Russia's willingness and ability to pay its debt obligations"". The ratings agency said default risks had increased and that foreign bondholders are likely to recoup only part of their investment. Moody's and its peers Fitch and S&P Global had scored Russia at investment-grade levels of Baa3/BBB as recently as March 1. All three have since cut their ratings by several notches, sending Russia's sovereign debt deep into so-called ""junk"" territory.

3/7/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Berkshire Hathaway Inc., the conglomerate run by billionaire Warren Buffett, boosted its investment in energy giant Occidental Petroleum Corp. as oil prices hit their highest level in almost a decade. Most Read from Bloomberg Ukraine Update: U.K. Premier Says More Pressure Needed on Putin Putin’s Ruble Workaround Still Leaves Bond Payments in Doubt Ukraine Update: House Explores Russian Oil Ban Putin Warns Ukraine as Safe-Passage Plans Descend Into Chaos Stakes Rise as Putin Says His War in Ukraine Will Continue Berkshire this year purchased almost 30 million additional shares of Occidental, according to a Friday regulatory filing, bringing its total holdings to 113.7 million shares. Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire holds about 11.2% of Occidental common shares in an investment currently valued at about $6.4 billion. Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the purchase. Berkshire’s additional investment in Occidental comes as the price of crude has surged to multi-year highs following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and fears of a supply crunch. Oil topped $115 a barrel on news the U.S. is considering a ban on imports of Russian crude as additional punishment on Moscow. Prices could reach $150 a barrel in the next three months if Russian crude continues to be largely shunned, said Damien Courvalin, head of energy research at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Shares of Occidental soared this week, logging a 45% gain, the biggest gain since 2020. Occidental’s shares haven’t been this high since its May 2019 announcement of a definitive $55-billion deal, inclusive of debt, for Anadarko Petroleum Corp. Buffett invested $10 billion to help fund Occidental’s takeover of Anadarko. Most of Berkshire’s stake in Occidental -- more than 83 million shares -- are tied to warrants acquired in that deal, which have been generating payments. Billionaire activist investor, Carl Icahn, who battled the Anadrako deal and blasted Buffett’s expensive financing, cut his stake in Occidental to 3.4%, selling 26,941,467 shares between Feb. 28 through March 2, according to filings. A representative for Icahn wasn’t immediately available for comment.

3/7/2022,"Mortgage rates hit reverse going into March, ending a string of weekly increases through mid-February. In the week ending 24th February, 30-year fixed rates slid by 13 basis points to 3.76%. 30-year fixed rates had slipped by 3 basis points in the week prior. Year-on-year, 30-year fixed rates were up by 74 basis points. 30-year fixed rates were still down by 118 basis points since November 2018’s last peak of 4.94%. Economic data from the U.S took a back seat as demand for the safe havens saw a slide in U.S Treasury yields, which weighed on mortgage rates. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine weighed heavily on riskier assets in the week. The weekly average rates for new mortgages, as of 3rd March, were quoted by Freddie Mac to be: 30-year fixed rates slid by 13 basis points to 3.76% in the week. This time last year, rates had stood at 3.02%. The average fee remained unchanged at 0.8 points. 15-year fixed rates fell by 13 basis points to 3.01% in the week. Rates were up by 67 basis points from 2.34% a year ago. The average fee rose from 0.7 points to 0.8 points. 5-year fixed rates declined by 7 basis points to 2.91%. Rates were up by 18 basis points from 2.73% a year ago. The average fee remained unchanged at 0.3 points. According to Freddie Mac, Geopolitical tensions led to a fall in U.S Treasury yields as investors moved to the safety of bonds. Falling yields led to a decline in mortgage rates. While inflationary pressures remain, the impact of the war in Ukraine has caused market uncertainty. Rates are expected to stay low in the short term but will likely resume the upward trend in the coming months. For the week ending 25th February, the rates were: Average interest rates for 30-year fixed with conforming loan balances rose from 4.05% to 4.15%. Points decreased from 0.48 to 0.44 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. Average 30-year fixed mortgage rates backed by FHA increased from 4.09% to 4.15%. Points rose from 0.56 to 0.74 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. Average 30-year rates for jumbo loan balances increased from 3.84% to 3.88%. Points fell from 0.45 to 0.40 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. Weekly figures released by the Mortgage Bankers Association showed that the Market Composite Index, a measure of mortgage loan application volume, slipped by 0.7% in the week ending 25th February. The Index tumbled by 13.1% in the previous week. The Refinance Index increased by 1% and was 56% lower than the same week a year ago. In the week prior, the Index had fallen 16%. The refinance share of mortgage activity fell from 50.1% to 49.9%. In the previous week, the share decreased from 52.8 to 50.1%. According to the MBA, Mortgage rates reached multi-year highs, weighing on application activity. As a result of rising rates, the refinance share of applications fell below 50%. Purchase activity remained weak, but the average loan size increased again. The MBA will continue to assess the potential impact on mortgage demand from the sharp drop in interest rates this week due to the invasion of Ukraine. It’s a quiet first half of the week, with stats limited to U.S JOLT’s job openings. Market sentiment towards Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and news updates will remain the key driver. A further escalation of military strikes on Ukraine and responses by NATO, the United Nations, and Western governments would drive demand for bonds and weigh on mortgage rates.

3/7/2022,"By Arathy Somasekhar HOUSTON (Reuters) - Alberta, Canada's main oil-producing region, can help alleviate the global oil supply crunch caused by energy disruptions, Alberta energy minister, Sonya Savage, said on Sunday. Alberta has some spare pipeline and rail capacity and can move more oil to the United States, Savage said in Houston ahead of the CERAWeek energy conference by S&P Global. Oil prices in Monday trading in Asia have soared to $128 per barrel, up from about $83 per barrel in January. ""We are the solution, not Venezuela and others,"" Savage told Reuters, an apparent reference to U.S. sending a delegation to Caracas last week to discuss an easing of U.S. oil sanctions. She also said it was ""unconscionable"" for any nation to be buying Russian crude oil or refined products in light of its invasion of Ukraine. Oil buyers have been shunning oil cargoes from Russia, one of the world's largest petroleum exporters. Russia exports 4-5 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil and 2-3 million bpd of refined products. Savage said the United States should ban imports of Russian crude oil and refined products. Canada last week banned Russian crude oil imports and agreed to supply anti-tank weapons to Ukraine to counter the Russian invasion. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"".
