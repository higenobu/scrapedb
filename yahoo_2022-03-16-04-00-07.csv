3/16/2022,"By Krisztina Than BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary will not send any weapons to Ukraine and will stay out of the war, Prime Minister Viktor Orban told a rally of his supporters on Tuesday, accusing the opposition of trying to drag Hungary into the conflict on its eastern border. The conservative nationalist leader has a tight race for election to a fourth consecutive term on April 3 because for the first time since 2010 his right-wing Fidesz party will face a united front of six opposition parties. Orban's path to re-election is complicated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has put his decade-long close relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a new light, drawing sharp criticism from the opposition. Addressing a rally of tens of thousands of supporters who waved the Hungarian national flag in front of parliament, Orban said Central Europe was only a ""chess board"" for big powers and if Hungary did not stand up for its interests, it could easily fall victim of the crisis. ""Russia looks at Russian interests, while Ukraine looks at Ukrainian interests. Neither the United States, nor Brussels would think with Hungarians' mind and feel with Hungarians' hearts. We must stand up for our own interests,"" Orban said. ""We must stay out of this war ... therefore we will not send any troops or weapons to the battlegrounds."" Orban said the choice for voters on April 3 will be between his party that wants peace and the leftist opposition ""which would stagger into a ruthless, protracted and bloody war."" The six-party opposition, led by Peter Marki-Zay, a small-town mayor and father of seven, has sharply criticised Orban's relations with Russia, saying Orban had built an illiberal state along Putin's model, with rampant corruption and curbs on media freedoms. The government denies the allegations. Speaking to an opposition rally by the Danube river, Marki-Zay, who has campaigned on a strongly pro-European platform, said Hungarians' choice has never been this easy in elections. ""We only have one choice: we must choose Europe instead of the east ... and freedom instead of authoritarianism,"" he said, with supporters chanting ""Europa, Europa."" Referring to European Union concerns about a decline in democratic standards in Hungary, Marki-Zay has said Orban's ""unlimited power has resulted in unlimited corruption"" while millions of Hungarians struggle to make ends meet. Fidesz slightly widened its lead in a late February opinion poll by Median to 39% compared with 32% for the opposition bloc. Orban has condemned the Russian invasion and has said Budapest would not veto EU sanctions agreed against Russia but that these must not affect Hungary's energy supplies.

3/16/2022,"Republican Senate candidate Herschel Walker cast doubt on the theory of evolution in recent remarks, saying the fact that apes and humans coexist disproves accepted science. “At one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ... If that is true, why are there still apes? Think about it,” Herschel said in an appearance at Sugar Hill Church in Georgia on Sunday. “Now you’re getting too smart for us, Herschel,” lead pastor Chuck Allen responded. Walker is currently the front-runner in the GOP contest to challenge Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) in November. He’s a former NFL star who has the endorsement of former President Donald Trump, and he’s outspoken about his Christian faith. Walker is hardly the first GOP candidate who has run for office questioning evolution. Humans did not evolve from the apes that you see at the zoo. Rather, humans and apes have a common (and now extinct) ancestor that lived roughly 10 million years ago. Technically, all humans are apes, but that doesn’t mean that chimpanzees are one step away from becoming people. Walker’s summary of evolution is incorrect, and there’s nothing incompatible about humans coexisting with other apes. Evolution and Christianity also aren’t necessarily at odds, and a number of prominent Christians have said it is possible to believe in both God and the science of evolution. The Walker campaign didn’t respond to a request for additional comment. Walker further dismissed scientific progress, saying science “can’t do” the “conception of a baby.” “They’re still trying to do that, but they can’t, because there has to be a God,” he said. Science has, of course, made remarkable progress over the years in assisting people trying to have children, with methods like in vitro fertilization. Walker remains the front-runner in the race despite facing domestic violence allegations. In their divorce proceedings, his ex-wife alleged that he displayed “physically abusive and threatening behavior” during their marriage. In one instance, she said, he pointed a gun at her head and said, “I’m going to blow your ... brains out.” Two other women have also claimed that Walker threatened them. In a December interview with Axios, Walker said he has struggled with mental health issues and is “accountable” for his past actions, without going into specifics about his behavior toward his ex-wife.

3/16/2022,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said Tuesday he is meeting with advocates for decertifying President Joe Biden's win in the battleground state, hours before he and the state Senate's top Republican were to discuss the topic with county GOP leaders. Vos told The Associated Press he was also inviting those who believe the 2020 election cannot be decertified to discuss it along with advocates for decertification on Wednesday. “I still believe that we do not have the ability to decertify, but I said I would listen to those who are bringing experts to say we can and we will see if they can prove their case,” Vos said in an interview. “I've asked people who think we can and think we can't to all sit in a room and discuss it and that's what we're doing tomorrow.” Vos has been under pressure from former President Donald Trump and other Republicans who support his false claims that the election was stolen and say Vos is not doing enough, including decertifying Biden's win. The meetings come after the investigator hired by Vos, former Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman, earlier this month urged lawmakers to consider decertifying Biden’s win. Trump said last week that he was “confident that Robin will exercise his moral duty” and follow up on Gableman's finding, including dissolving the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission. Vos has said he does not support that. Trump also said, “I would imagine that there can only be a Decertification of Electors.” Vos and other Republican leaders have repeatedly said that would not be done, citing opinions from the Legislature’s nonpartisan attorneys who have said such a move is illegal. Rick Esenberg, the head of the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, also says decertification is illegal. One of those who will attend the meeting with Vos on Wednesday is former Menomonee Falls village president Jefferson Davis. He has organized a pair of rallies at the Capitol attended by Tim Ramthun, a Republican candidate for governor and state representative who has introduced resolutions to decertify the vote. Davis said he and others will be presenting evidence to Vos that shows there were between 250,000 and 300,000 fake ballots cast in the election and that decertification can legally be done. “Donald Trump won the state of Wisconsin in such a landslide, it’s not even funny,"" Davis said. ”And we will have the evidence.” Davis said the goal is to convince Vos and other Republicans that Biden's win should be pulled back or the election should be held again. “What has to change tomorrow is Robin Vos’ heart and head and soul,"" Davis said. Biden's win by just under 21,000 votes over Trump has withstood lawsuits, recounts and reviews both by the nonpartisan Legislative Audit Bureau and the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty. Gableman's report, which was  panned by Democrats and Republicans, did not provide any evidence to back up Davis' claims of more than 250,000 illegally cast ballots. To date, only 24 people out of nearly 3.3 million who cast ballots have been charged with election fraud in Wisconsin. Trump's own attorney general has said there was no widespread fraud. Still, some Republicans refuse to back down and Vos has authorized Gableman's investigation to continue.  On Wednesday night in Plover, Vos planned to join state Republican Party Chairman Paul Farrow and Senate Republican Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu in meeting with county Republican Party leaders. Farrow, who called the meeting, said about two-thirds of county chairs will be there. He said he expected about half of the discussion to focus on election integrity issues. Farrow said he is focused on the fall election — in which Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson are on the ballot — not relitigating 2020, and he hopes that following the meeting local leaders will feel the same. A Marquette University Law School poll of Wisconsin residents released earlier this month found that 67% of respondents said they were very or somewhat confident the election results were accurate. But 61% of Republicans were not confident. Davis said GOP leaders need to listen more to the concerns of grassroots Republicans who believe the election was stolen. “This is the No. 1 issue in Wisconsin and it’s not going away,"" Davis said.",Politics/Associated Press,Wisconsin GOP leader Vos to meet with election fraud backers,https://news.yahoo.com/wisconsin-gop-leader-vos-meet-180250265.html
