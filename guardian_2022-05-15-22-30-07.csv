5/15/2022,"Saudi Aramco, the world’s biggest oil company, has announced an 82% rise in quarterly profits to a new record of $39.5bn (£32.2bn), boosted by an increase in demand and higher crude prices. The company, which last week overtook technology group Apple to become the world’s most valuable company, said it would pay an $18.8bn (£15.3bn) dividend and hand out $4bn (£3.2bn) in bonus shares to its investors after the better than expected performance. Energy companies such as BP and Shell have posted their highest profits in at least a decade as a result of rising commodities prices fuelled by the unwinding of Covid-19 restrictions around the world and sanctions on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. Energy prices have also been driven by strong demand in Asia for gas and a cold winter in 2020 which depleted supplies, leaving stocks low as temperatures dropped in the northern hemisphere last year. Profits have risen despite many groups taking a hit from exiting investments in Russia as Brent crude prices have soared by almost 70% to $107.91 (£87.99) a barrel in March compared with a year before. Earlier this month, BP said profits more than doubled to $6.2bn (£5bn) in the first three months of the year. Shell has reported a record quarterly profit of $9.1bn (£7.3bn) for the first three months of the year. OPEC+, the producers group which includes Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Russia, agreed this month to a modest increase in its monthly oil output target, but has said it is not possible for other producers to replace Russian exports of more than 7m barrels a day. Aramco has a particularly low cost of production, as much of its oil is in easy-to-tap fields onshore or in shallow waters. That boosts profitability at the company, which is still 95% owned by the Saudi government. Amin H Nasser, the president and chief executive of Aramco, said the company was helping meet world demand for reliable and affordable energy against a backdrop of “increased volatility.” “Energy security is vital and we are investing for the long term, expanding our oil and gas production capacity to meet anticipated demand growth,” he said. “As we collaborate with domestic and international partners to explore new and emerging technologies and solutions, from developing cleaner transport technologies to establishing low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia value chains, I am more optimistic than ever about the positive contribution we can make, both to our customers and to the ongoing global energy transition.”",News/Business,Saudi oil giant Aramco reports 82% rise in quarterly profits to record $39.5bn,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/15/saudi-oil-giant-aramco-reports-82-rise-in-quarterly-profits-to-record-395bn
5/15/2022,"Perhaps a dodgy meal will not stop Spurs this time. When it was announced that Dejan Kulusevski would start on the bench after contracting a stomach bug that had affected other members of the squad, it was hard not to draw parallels with the “lasagne-gate” drama of 2006, which helped Arsenal pip them to the Champions League. But Tottenham negotiated a sizeable banana skin nevertheless and can watch their closest rivals seek a way past Newcastle tomorrow night with a two-point advantage in fourth. They can thank VAR for that. Burnley were irate but the penalty award that won this game looked correct by the letter of today’s mind-numbing laws. Ashley Barnes’s arm was deemed in an unnatural position when the ball struck it as half-time approached but it would barely have been a talking point had play not been called back for the review. Harry Kane had little time for such concerns; he buried the spot kick, leaving relegation-threatened Burnley to live on their nerves next weekend and ensuring a leggy Tottenham got the job done. Their ability to achieve that was in question for long periods. The biggest intrigue, as the first half took shape, was whether a rugged Burnley could get away with their approach for an entire 90 minutes. Mike Jackson had gone with a flat back five and, although critically weakened by the absences of Ben Mee and James Tarkowski, the away defence showed ample appetite to hack, block and scrap at anything sent in their direction. Tottenham did not begin as if affected by sickness, nor by the rapid turnaround since Thursday’s jubilant derby night, but the lack of an early breakthrough naturally risked fomenting tension. While Spurs began at speed, flipping the ball from one side to the other with alacrity, Burnley were rarely turned around. All the same, there were one or two narrow escapes. Nick Pope was sharp to deal with a whipped cross-shot from Son Heung-min and a speculative yet troublesome drive from Emerson Royal; he was grateful to clutch one Kane header after Ryan Sessegnon’s accurate cross and even more thankful for the sharp intervention of Nathan Collins when a second seemed bound for his far corner. Burnley did not leave their own half for almost 20 minutes. But they could sense the passing of a storm and, perhaps, that ripple of uncertainty from the stands. Davinson Sánchez did just enough to prevent Dwight McNeil making meaningful contact on a cross and then, just before the half-hour, they created the calibre of chance that had eluded Tottenham. Collins was the architect, advancing from the back and slipping a smart pass behind Sánchez to free Maxwel Cornet. The angle gave Hugo Lloris a chance and, repelling with his left fist, he denied Burnley a goal out of the blue. Spurs had, though, begun to drift. Denied space in which to break, this had become a test of their craft in front of opponents primarily focused on spoiling. When Kane pulled a by now rare chance wide in the final minute of added time, meeting Lucas Moura’s cutback from the kind of position he usually exploits in his sleep, Burnley appeared to have reached the interval in some degree of comfort. Immediately, their plans were shattered. Moura had taken possession after Burnley had scrappily cleared Son’s deflected delivery from a short corner, whose execution had initially been met with groans. Nobody had appealed for any offence but a protracted VAR check showed Sánchez, trying to redirect the ball into the danger zone after it had spun up, finding Barnes’s outstretched arm. Barnes was at point-blank range but today’s interpretation of the rules would find no excuse for the extension of his limb. Unfortunate or not, a penalty now felt inevitable and its award was confirmed after Kevin Friend checked his monitor. Kane got his bearings right this time and Spurs had got away with a performance of dwindling intensity. Burnley’s feelings were summed up by heated protests in the tunnel, their substitute Phil Bardsley taking particular issue with Spurs’s backroom staff. They re-emerged as if fired up, Kevin Long heading narrowly wide. Shortly afterwards Collins rose to meet a free-kick but nodded over. For a time the ball hardly left Spurs’ territory; Burnley, after all, could not afford to hang everything on Brighton compounding Leeds’s misery at Elland Road. Kane shot narrowly over but, in the 62nd minute, Burnley were within inches of a reward they would probably have merited. Found in space 20 yards out, Barnes beat Lloris with a cleanly-hit drive but watched his moment of redemption evaporate as it thudded against the right-hand post. A consequence of Burnley’s relative ambition was the opening-up of the spaces Spurs enjoy. When Sessegnon found one, he cut back for Son to draw an outstanding reflex save from Pope. The keeper denied him again in the last 10 minutes; Burnley threw men forward towards the end but their fate remains in the balance.",Sport/Football,Harry Kane’s penalty sinks Burnley and boosts Tottenham’s top-four hopes,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/15/tottenham-burnley-premier-league-match-report

5/15/2022,"Can seagulls recognise you? My friend swears blind that his local gulls torment him personally. Is there anything in this? Edward Lambourn, Rhyl Send new questions to nq@theguardian.com. Dr Livingston Seagull, I presume? MrCassandra I have had experiences in my own garden where a swallow and a mistle thrush have taken to attacking myself and only one of my springer spaniels. They ignored my husband, visitors to the house and even my quieter spaniel. There is no doubt in my mind that they knew me. I was the one most often in the garden, sometimes, on other missions, in the vicinity of their nests. They would set on me when I was nowhere near the nests. Everyone else was ignored, even when they were fairly close to the nests. Cherry Alexander, Ardgay A happy day was had at the Jersey shore (New Jersey, that is) despite a double-whammy from a seagull while sunbathing. I was “dropped upon” at both 0800 and 1400 hours. Twice, six hours apart. Smack on to my swimsuit. Bad luck, a bird dare or target practice? He knew. B Saltzman, Woodland, California There is a herring gull that sits every morning on the chimney of the house directly behind ours and shouts loudly at a teenager’s bedroom window until she gets up, opens the window and shouts back. We’ve named him Stephen. scaryoldcortina I don’t know about seagulls, but I have a blackbird that appears in my garden every time he spots me. I have been feeding him raisins, and he has come to expect a nice juicy breakfast. Geraldine Blake, Worthing Yes. They pester my neighbour to feed them even when he is on the other side of our village. I’ve seen them tap on the window when they see him in someone else’s house having a cup of tea. BobbleAlong Yes, without question. Gulls are not just long-lived but very intelligent birds. I live in a flat in Brighton and my outdoor area is a platform built on top of the flat roof of part of an extension at the back of the building. It is slightly below the roof and the chimneys of the main building. For all of my time here (the last six years) a pair of seagulls have nested either on the flat part of the extension next door (separated from my bit by a metal railing with lots of gaps in it) or on the chimney. Their chicks, when they get old enough, inevitably come and wander around my bit of the flat roof. For much of that time I used to smoke and went out on to my platform many times a day and night. The gulls are completely chilled about me being around, they wake up and have a look, and after that ignore me. Even when the chicks are wandering around and I come out on to the platform they keep a weather eye out, but ignore me, as I ignore their chicks. If anyone else comes out, though, they become highly agitated, call alarms the whole time and will even try poo bombing to drive them away. By the way, if that sounds mostly sweet and lovely, the noise and mess is appalling and I’d be very happy if they nested somewhere else! Paul Is your friend called Cliff? Le74 Not only can seagulls recognise you, they also know where you live (or at least where your car’s parked). John Boyd-Brent There has been a lot of research into gull behaviour recently. None of the results are particularly surprising to anyone who takes the time to watch them for more than a moment. They quickly become accustomed to those who are likely to be providers but still watch to see food eaten first. So, although they readily pick out the generous types, they withhold trust, preferring to swoop down and eat a half-eaten pasty or the remnants of a bag of chips than an uneaten sandwich. woodworm20 I am a professional ornithologist who was involved in a long-term study of urban gulls nesting on roof tops (herring gulls and lesser black-backed gulls – there’s no such thing as a “seagull”). At the start of this study, I and my colleagues trapped some of these gulls (under licence) and put rings and GPS trackers on them to study their behaviour and movements. Needless to say, this did not endear us to the gulls at all. I subsequently made many visits to the same rooftops and the same gulls over several years. The gulls always responded to my presence by immediately alarm-calling and mobbing me, singling me out among other people before I even made it on to the roof. It didn’t matter what clothes I wore or which car I drove. I was sure that the gulls saw me as a particular threat based on my past behaviour, and were able to recognise me, even though sometimes many months went by between visits. In the most extreme example, a male lesser black-backed gull appeared to recognise me and mobbed me as I watched him out of a very high window, where only my face and binoculars would have been visible. I should add that I’m a redhead, so this may make it easier for them. So in my opinion, the answer for these two species at least is “yes”. Perhaps this guy did something once that his local gulls didn’t approve of, or perhaps his daily commute takes him close to a nest site. In any case I never experienced a gull making contact when “defending” their nests (they usually just swoop and call). Gulls mobbing people for food are a different story, and this is unfortunately a problem we have created for ourselves by feeding them. Both these species are decreasing at natural colonies and increasing in urban areas, probably because their natural habitats no longer provide them with what they need. Again, this is a problem of our own making and we probably need to learn ways of living harmoniously with these birds. They’re really very interesting. Rebecca Jones They did some research into whether crows could do it. Used a Dick Cheney face mask and upset crows while wearing it. For a long time after that they would mob anyone sporting the mask. Which suggests it’s a) a fun way to upset visiting politicians, and b) it’s definitely possible that gulls may be able to recognise faces. unclestinky Let’s reverse the question. Can the Guardian recognise birds? On several occasions I have noticed that the Guardian misidentifies birds or uses photos of the wrong bird to illustrate a story. You used a photo of the ring-billed gull (Larus delawarensis) in a story about Britons’ interaction with “seagulls”. The name is a giveaway. This is a North American bird, with a very large population on the Great Lakes. Most of the submissions are about herring gulls, a species widespread in the British Isles. Not the same thing. Howard Ross, Kingston, Ontario We have named the herring gull that visits us most mornings as Sebastian. As a fledgling he walked with our dog in the park eating dog snacks and followed us home. My wife can hand-feed him and his wife, Sabina, but both will fly off if I try. Sebastian will often walk into our kitchen through the back door and look up at us, expecting his breakfast. I even found him in the lounge last summer when doors where open. So yes, herring gulls do recognise us and we can recognise them. Sam Coombes Some years ago a pair of lesser black-backed gulls nested on my chimney. A fairly mature chick fell out of the nest and landed in the garden. I had no way of getting it back to the nest, so I kept it in the garden and fed it on sprats and fish pieces I bought and scrounged from the local fish market, locked it away, safe from neighbours’ cats at night, and eventually, after a couple of weeks, it fledged and flew off. The children named it Lucky. As a reward, the parent birds mobbed me any time I left the house, following me to the local shop and mobbing me when I exited. I was the only one feeding the chick, partly because it had a tendency to bite your fingers, and I was the only one mobbed. None of this I found to be particularly unusual behaviour, assuming that they recognised me and associated me as being a danger to their chick. However, what did surprise me was that, the following year, a pair of lesser black-backed gulls nested on the chimney again and mobbed me (and only me) any time I left the house, despite not losing a chick. I assumed that they were the same pair, that they not only recognised me and saw me as a threat but had retained the memory for a year. The third year they did not return – thankfully! Preston Shalton Seagulls seem to recognise me as I walk along the beachfront to feed them with food scraps. They spot me from a distance and start to circle me, squawking and fluttering. Whether it is me or the plastic container of scraps I am carrying that is recognised is, perhaps, open for debate. David Litchfield Definitely recognise me. A few years ago a seagull chick fell out of its nest on our roof. I did the decent thing and put it in a box and climbed a ladder to put it back on the roof. It screamed its head off the whole time, attracting dozens of adult gulls that attacked me incessantly while I was on the ladder. Not content with that, the parents then divebombed me every time I left the house for the rest of the breeding season. And for the next couple of years. Bastards! Mike Patching Seagulls do recognise specific people. Fred, as I call him, comes down from our roof when I am in our front garden because he knows I will throw him a handful of mealworms, but he never does if it is my husband, neighbours or anyone else outside the front of our house. Chris Callard Yes. I have a gull friend who arrives every year in April, turns up every morning and runs down the roof when he sees me. Later in the summer his partner and the year’s offspring will join him. He’s particularly loud at 5am. I’m convinced he’s a gull I raised and released 15 years ago, which means he must be pretty old. Merle1 A look at all the various species of gull listed in the Audubon Society Encyclopedia of North American Birds suggests that quite a few species routinely live more than 10 years and several longer-lived species live more than 20. ProfessorSogolHerring gulls (urban subspecies) nest on my roof. When babies start to move about, Mum and Dad will swoop and mob strangers, but not me. Inotrek Crows I’ve known for years recognise me with or without my bike. When I’m in company they arrive unobtrusively, and it can take a bit to realise. Other birds, such as pigeons and robins can approach if I sit on a bench, and I infer that they often get lucky with humans there. Karendash I used to feed and raise a few pigeons back when I was in India, they could recognise me pretty well, so it wouldn’t be surprising that gulls could do the same. My mother raised a baby coucal, and the bird recognised her and used to come for visits. paul939 Yes, absolutely. In fact, not only can they recognise you but they can sense your emotions, just like any other animal. Craig R Bell You really must be very gullible to believe this … Alejandro Larrosa While I’m not able to confirm if seagulls can remember human faces, I can confirm that a seagull shitting on you while on a first date will not in fact lead to a second date. I can also confirm that a person will be able to recognise you after almost 20 years and introduce you to the group as “that guy the seagull shat on”. moemanmoe",Lifestyle/Life and style,Readers reply: can seagulls recognise you?,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/15/readers-reply-can-seagulls-recognise-you
5/15/2022,"I’m listening to BBC Radio 1, where they are interviewing the 26-year-old actor and singer Dove Cameron about her globally successful hit, Boyfriend. The DJ, Melvin Odoom, asks her, “Do you think that your acting career has helped you with, kind of, like, your music career?” “For me they’re, like, the same energy,” replies Cameron. “Which is like, when people are like, ‘You have to choose,’ I’m like, ‘They feel the same!’” It’s the most predictable celebrity interview exchange ever uttered, remarkable only for one word that repeats and repeats. “It’s a really funny one,” says Fiona Hanlon, who has worked at the station for more than 10 years, including producing Nick Grimshaw’s breakfast show and Maya Jama’s weekend show. “If a guest says ‘like’ too much we’d get texts from the listeners. If a DJ says it too much, sometimes a boss might pop in and mention it… It’s just seen as a bit lazy, a bit dumb. I was always very aware of it.” Why do people have such a problem with “like”? Is it because it simply won’t go away? In 1992, Malcolm Gladwell wrote a robust defence of the word and the way it carries “a rich emotional nuance”, responding to what had already been a decade of criticism. This did nothing to settle the debate. Linguists agree that usage of the word has increased every year since then, to the point where in one five-minute exchange on Love Island in 2017, the word was uttered 76 times, once every four seconds. By the time I was at secondary school in the early 2000s, “like” was just a natural part of speech. Transcribing the interviews I did for this piece, I say it constantly. When I do, I find it a friendly crutch, signalling to the person I’m talking to that we’re having a spontaneous and unrehearsed conversation, that I’m listening and thinking. But despite its long history and widespread use, for many it remains enraging. Politicians, educators and business leaders have complained it makes speakers sound stupid. When Michael Gove was education secretary in 2014, he used an update to the national curriculum to require students to speak in “standard English”, even in informal settings, in all British schools. This reinforced the idea that there was only one right way to speak English. By 2019, one primary school head in Bradford, Christabel Shepherd, said she banned the word because, “When children are giving you an answer and they say, ‘Is it, like, when you’re, like…’ they haven’t actually made a sentence at all. They use the word all the time and we are trying to get rid of it.” Nick Gibb, then schools minister, praised the decision and said others should follow suit. Scores of recruitment specialists and public-speaking coaches have publicly bemoaned the word’s rise and say those who use it prevent themselves from getting opportunities. One law firm in America sent a memo to just its female employees and told them: “Learn hard words,” and “Stop saying ‘like’.” Peter Mertens, an associate at PR firm Burson Cohn & Wolfe, has said: “There is nothing that will [lead you to being] dismissed more quickly than a few too many ‘likes’ during a meeting or on a call.” There’s even an app, LikeSo, recommended by businesses, which listens to your speech and promises it can stop you using the word. In the UK, this chorus is made louder by a group of mostly old and white celebrities and Spectator columnists who crusade against its use. In 2010, Emma Thompson complained to the Radio Times that she “went to give a talk at my old school and the girls were all doing their ‘likes’ and ‘innits?’ which drives me insane… I told them ‘Just don’t do it. Because it makes you sound stupid.’” Gyles Brandreth, writing in the Oldie (where else?), complained that “like” was “the lazy linguistic filler of our times” and “very very irritating”. Why is it so detested? “Well, humans have an innate tendency to judge. People who are very liberal in other aspects of things, who would never judge someone based on race or sexual orientation or whatever, still have this thing about language,” says Carmen Fought, professor of linguistics at Pitzer College. “They want to freeze it and they want to judge it. I absolutely guarantee you that in Shakespeare’s time, there was some schoolmaster walking around saying, ‘Don’t say “soothe” Portia, that sounds so tacky, say “For soothe.”’” There’s certainly an element of sexism here and the detractors of “like” say it makes you sound girlish and stupid, arguing that this is a newish tic said mostly by women and that it’s a meaningless “filler” word that doesn’t add anything to a sentence’s meaning. But they are, in fact, wrong on every count. The first point is that “like” isn’t just a filler word. It’s actually an incredibly versatile and dynamic word. The linguist Alexandra D’Arcy, who wrote a book on the word, outlined its many uses. There are its traditional uses as a verb, “I like the smell of what’s cooking” and a preposition, “This tastes like it was made in a restaurant”. Then there are the ones that are the subject of scorn. The first of these is the quotative “like”: “He cooked a spag bol for me last night, I was like, that’s delicious.” It allows you to tell a story without promising complete accuracy. Indeed, one of the most enjoyable things about this kind of “like” is that you can tell an anecdote that makes you sound wittier and more erudite than you actually are because you’re not promising exactly what was said but the feeling of what was said. The other hated “likes” are as a discourse marker, “What did I do last night? Like, had dinner, hung out”; an adverb to mean approximately, “It was super quick to cook, like 30 minutes”, and what’s known as a discourse particle, which goes in the middle of a phrase, rather than at the end of it, “This dinner is like the best I’ve eaten.” But there are more uses than that, for example the Geordie tradition of finishing sentences with a like. “He cooked dinner for me, like,” and increasingly “like” is also used as a noun because of Facebook and Instagram, “I gave it a like.” Many of these uses often overlap in a way that is incredibly rich. If you say, “He was like, seething about the pasta sauce,” you are quoting someone’s reaction, but at the same time highlighting you are approximating their response, while pausing to highlight that you are thinking meaningfully about this reaction in real time. That one word is doing all those jobs, all the while creating a sense of familiarity between you and the person you’re talking to. The word’s incredible flexibility is nothing new either. Most people think the word “like” dates back to the 80s, as typified by the Frank Zappa song Valley Girl, in which his daughter, Moon Zappa, impersonates a California bimbo, ad-libbing that: “I, like, love going into, like, clothing stores and stuff, I, like, buy the neatest miniskirts and stuff. It’s, like, so bitchin.’” But it goes much further back. In Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night, written at the start of the 17th century, Valentine says to Cesario, “If the Duke continue these favours towards you, Cesario, you are like to be much advanced.” The linguist Anatoly Liberman says that this version of “like” was being used as a shorthand for likely, and may be the beginnings of our contemporary usage. “Consider the following,” he writes. “‘All these three, belike, went together’ (1741, OED). Take away be-, and you will get a charming modern sentence: ‘All these three, like, went together.’” Belike meant “in all likelihood”. It’s easy to imagine how this use of “like” could transform into like being used more generally as a way to break up speech. Perhaps it was aided by the Irish, Liverpudlian and Geordie use of the word to mean roughly “or thereabouts”. Or by the beat poets of 1950s, who would often start the sentences with “Like” (interestingly, fewer people now complain that these more masculine uses sound stupid, despite the fact they could also be described as filler words). It’s true that young women in the 1980s probably invented the quotative “like”, but they are far from the only group to use it now. And research suggests that the discourse particle “like”, the one that comes in like the midpoint of a sentence, is used more by men than women. But the biggest lie about “like” is that it’s stupid; that it adds nothing to the meaning of a sentence. “People say language is random. But language is almost never random. You can’t just stick that like in anywhere,” says Fought. “So for example, if I say, ‘Oh look at that boy over there. He’s wearing a top hat. And he’s like, 10.’ That makes perfect sense. But if you say ‘How old is your brother’? And I say ‘He’s like, 10’ that’s a little more unusual. Or if I said, ‘My, like, grandma died.’ That’d be a very strange context to hear it. So there’s patterns. There’s ways to do it more grammatically.” More than being internally logical, it is also a way of signalling. “It helps with what we call focus. I’m showing you this is the important part, this is the part that connects, it can be for interpersonal connection, it’s checking in that you and I are connecting. It’s an incredibly useful part of speech. If it really were meaningless and had no purpose in a sentence, it would be much easier for us to leave it out.” This is what I think when I listen to Radio 1 or watch vlogs by young women like the TikTok star Emma Chamberlain or Billie Eilish, both of whom are heavy “like” users. They have this almost instinctual way of using language not just to convey meaning but to convey a moment around that meaning. It’s almost, like, magic. Fought adds that although the debate around “like” can be fun, when it comes to teachers punishing children for saying the word there are more serious impacts. “There’s nothing more non-conducive to learning and contrary to the purpose of education than constantly shutting kids down because of how they talk. If you want to teach a kid to practise having different language styles, that’s fine. But to demean and criticise the way someone speaks in any situation is very, very harmful.” So if linguists are largely agreed that “like” is, at least in some contexts, no bad thing, why does society still bristle at it? Katherine D Kinzler, the author of How You Say It, a book about linguistic bias – which she argues is one of the most persistent prejudices in our society – says that taking someone to task for the way they speak is one of the last societally accepted ways to exercise our prejudices. “Most people aren’t even aware this is something they might do. For example if you’re interviewing candidates for a job, it’s easy to think you’re not being biased, racist or sexist, that you’re just looking for a good communicator. But so many of our perceptions of who is a good communicator can be infused by other forms of biases that we’re not aware of.” Kinzler says that “like” is a good example of a word where young women are chastised for talking a certain way even though that isn’t borne out in the linguistic data. “‘Young and female’ is often the group that is associated with a lot of these vocal features, but actually you find lots of people in the population speak this way. It’s a similar thing with uptalk, ending your sentence by going up, like it’s a question? It’s also assumed that it’s a Valley girl way of speaking when in fact it occurs with lots of different groups.” In 2014, a mother wrote to the advice columnist in this magazine with a dilemma. “My adult daughter is clever, pretty and confident. However, she cannot stop saying ‘like’ about six times in every sentence… I know it is not the end of the world, but it makes her sound stupid and uneducated, which she most definitely is not, and when she wants to return to the real world I worry this will be held against her.” I hope she would take some comfort in knowing that the best linguistic studies today suggest people who say “like” may actually be more intelligent than those that don’t. One, published in the Journal of Language and Social Psychology, which examined 263 conversational transcripts, found that “conscientious people” and those who are more “thoughtful and aware of themselves and their surroundings” are the most likely to use discourse markers such as “like”. As Fought says, “I’m 55, I have a PhD, many people would consider that to be a sign of intelligence, and I’m a ‘like’ user. So this judgy thing, it’s natural, but it’s really not helpful.”",News/Science,"Why do people, like, say, like so much?",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/may/15/why-do-people-like-say-like-so-much-in-praise-of-an-underappreciated-word
5/15/2022,"In the shadow of the old Spode pottery works, in Stoke-on-Trent, something is stirring. Royals once dined off the fine china plates manufactured here, but the factory itself closed well over a decade ago, when its parent company went bust in the banking crash. Now, where it once stood, a very different way of working is taking shape. The Potbank site includes a cafe, a hotel and flexible office spaces built for a more rootless, hot-desking, post-pandemic culture emerging as “the world of work changes to embrace working from home”, according to Jeff Nash, director of the company that owns the scheme. There is ambitious talk of filling the grand old town halls and listed warehouses left over from the area’s glory days with hi-tech startups with much more flexible working cultures: video game designers, AI and robotics firms whose processes are transforming the ceramics still made here. “Silicon Stoke” is wooing creative media graduates from the town’s own university, but also young artists seeking cheap overheads and the kind of quirky, gritty, post-industrial vibe that cities like Manchester had 30 years ago. Unlike those who used to clock on at the Spode factory, with fast enough broadband they can work from anywhere: why pay a fortune to live in the gentrified big city? This story doesn’t fit stale cliches about “red wall” towns, and still less does it fit the prime minister’s stubborn insistence on everyone returning to a conventional office. But it helps explain why Stoke – where the cabinet held an awayday last week – is Britain’s third biggest growth area for remote and flexible jobs, according to a study led by the recruiters Indeed and video conferencing platform Zoom, which should turn lazy political arguments on their heads. Their league table of post-pandemic “Zoom towns” – places where adverts for jobs that can be worked flexibly or at least partly from home have more than trebled since 2020 – found 10 out of 25 overlapped with red-wall areas, with Tory-held Stoke and Burnley beaten only by the seaside town of Worthing. So much for home working being a “middle-class remainer cult”, as the Telegraph declared, for people who spent lockdown buying puppies and Pelotons. When Boris Johnson says that in his experience home working involves too much “walking very slowly to the fridge, hacking off a small piece of cheese” and then forgetting what you were actually doing; or Jacob Rees-Mogg tours Whitehall offices leaving pointed “sorry you were out when I visited” messages at empty desks, the message is that ordinary workers don’t have such perks, and neither should a hated elite. This isn’t levelling up but punching up, stoking envy instead of figuring out how everyone can enjoy a happier working life – which in jobs that can’t be done from home may mean other forms of flexibility instead, such as part-time hours or the small changes that make family life possible. But it’s also flatly at odds with reality. The Office for National Statistics predicts that 57% of workers will work at least partly from home by this autumn, while two-thirds of Britons already work flexibly in some way. The world is moving on regardless of politicians shouting into the wind, and while the owners of fast-emptying glass towers in the City may be dismayed, in places such as Stoke and Barnsley and Middlesbrough, it’s potentially revolutionary. What sucks the life from smaller towns is young people moving away for better jobs. But would more choose to stay close to their roots, in places where houses are still cheap and they have family nearby to help with the kids, if remote working for at least part of the week let them tap into big-city opportunities without having to up sticks? More home working means less commuting, putting money back into hard-pressed pockets; it breathes life back into struggling local high streets too, drawing new people in. In Grimsby, the tech entrepreneur Jason Stockwood – who was born in the town and recently bought its football club – has a vision for turning the place into a pool of expert digital remote workers, capable of taking jobs in London without having to actually live there. Across the Humber estuary, Hull is rebranding itself as the capital of co-working hubs – places where remote workers can hire desk space and congregate for a bit of creative inspiration. For office life is not dead yet. Rees-Mogg is right that people still need to bounce ideas off each other, learn from more experienced colleagues, and indeed just get out of the house. But they don’t need to be there five days a week to do it, which is why a hybrid working week is becoming the new norm. CEOs like the savings on office costs (did nobody tell Rees-Mogg that desks are empty because Whitehall has been encouraging civil servants to work from home for a decade to save money?), and the chance to hire beyond the shrinking pool of people who can afford to move to London. Beneath the skin of politics, where nobody can see it, there is some practical thinking going on. Next month the Tory thinktank Onward will host a panel event with the small-business minister, Paul Scully, on how remote working could help red-wall economies grow. Matt Warman, the Tory MP and former digital minister, has just begun a review of the future of work commissioned by Downing Street, which will consider how remote working could change the way Britons feel about where we live. In private many Tories sympathise with the reported view of the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, that counting bums on office seats has “a whiff of something Dickensian” about it: why not measure what people actually do, rather than where they’re sitting? And Stoke’s renaissance has undoubtedly relied on government levelling-up funds and money for fast broadband. Yet, in its public messaging at least, the supposed party of business lags behind business itself. Proposals to expand flexible working were ditched from last week’s Queen’s speech, while Rees-Mogg harrumphs about how working from home on a Monday or Friday indicates “not a serious attitude to work”. This is the toxic politics of nostalgia, fetishising the past at the expense of those whose lives could be transformed by moving on. Remote working isn’t a magic bullet to solve the red wall’s ills; and, like all big economic shifts, this one will have winners and losers. But that’s all the more reason for ministers to stop fighting change and start shaping it for the public good. For, as all post-industrial towns know, if you don’t go out and meet the future, eventually it simply moves on without you.

5/15/2022,"China has been central to the story of globalisation over the past 30 years but now it is struggling. More than two years after Covid-19 cases were discovered in Wuhan, the world’s most populous country has yet to get on top of the virus. Draconian lockdowns have been imposed because China’s vaccines are less effective than those available in the west, and immunity levels are lower as well. Growth is slowing and not just because of the tough restrictions insisted upon by President Xi Jinping. Flaws in China’s economic model coupled with a more hostile geopolitical climate mean the days of explosive expansion are over. Unlike the US the UK or the euro area, China is not facing the inflationary problem that has prompted central banks to raise (or think about raising) interest rates. On the contrary, the People’s Bank of China is easing policy to stimulate credit growth. The authorities will try to spend and export their way out of trouble. China’s emergence as an economic superpower was finally recognised in the aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2007-09. With its banks unable to function normally, the US was incapable of assuming its traditional task of hauling the global economy out of recession. Instead, the locomotive role went to China, which provided a twin boost to its economy through public investment and credit expansion. China grew at double-digit rates, sucking in goods from Germany and Japan. There were costs to this policy, one economic and one political. The economic cost was that China generated a colossal amount of debt, which fuelled a property boom. Non-financial debt as a share of the economy’s annual output (gross domestic product) has more than doubled since its pre global financial crisis levels to 290% of GDP. The problems of the property giant Evergrande emphasised the vulnerability of the economy to a debt crisis. The political cost started off being a matter of perception: fear in the US that China was a threat to American economic hegemony. Washington had been concerned in the 1980s about the threat posed by Japan, but China was a whole different ballgame. Initially, the assumption in Washington was that as China became richer so its political system would become more democratic. Xi’s hardline approach to dissent has disabused US politicians of this notion. As a result, the globalisation process first stalled and then went into reverse. The US turned protectionist under Trump and encouraged firms to bring their production back home. Complaints about the Chinese patent piracy and the theft of intellectual property grew louder. The US put pressure on its allies, Britain included, to ban Chinese inward investment in specific sectors. This trend was then amplified by the pandemic, which made the west even warier about being exposed to long supply chains that end in China. And while China will eventually emerge from Covid-19 lockdowns, the recent restrictions imposed in Shanghai and elsewhere have added to the nervousness. The time, in early 2017, when Xi turned up at the World Economic Forum in Davos as the defender of globalisation seems an awfully long while ago. The upshot of all this is that China’s growth rate looks certain to slow. Weaker growth and a zero tolerance approach to Covid create the conditions for political dissent – and political crackdowns. The underlying problems of the economy may get worse, especially if the authorities take the view that unbalanced growth is better than no growth at all. There will be many in the west, and in the US in particular, who will take delight at China’s discomfort. Not much unites Democrats and Republicans these days but one of the things that does is hostility towards Beijing. Donald Trump’s trade war led to a marked cooling of relations but they have remained chilly under Joe Biden. Washington should be careful what it wishes for. China is a massive economy, and a full-blown economic crash would be as damaging to the world as another sub-prime mortgage crisis in the US or the breakup of the euro. There is, though, another reason to be concerned. As Charles Dumas notes in a report for TS Lombard, China’s full integration into the global economy since the early 1990s has been a key factor behind the steady rise in share prices on Wall Street. Dumas says the past 100 years or so can be divided into two parts: the period 1914-91 and the post-cold war era since. The first period included two world wars, the Great Depression of the 1930s and the high inflation of the 1970s, with an alternative to capitalism always on offer from communism. The second period saw capitalism triumph over communism and western firms move to China, where labour costs were lower. Profits went up, and the yield demanded by investors for putting their money at risk went down. “The” danger in current markets is that the invasion by Russia of Ukraine, together with US-China divisions and de-globalisation, heralds insecurity for investors that requires a greater real-earnings yield in what could prove to become a new cold war between the west and China/Russia (the former communist, now totalitarian states),” Dumas says. There have been four stock market busts in the past 100 years: the Wall Street crash of 1929, the bursting of the Japanese equity bubble in 1991, the dot com implosion a decade later and the global financial crisis. Stock markets have fallen sharply in recent weeks and the assumption – as always – is that they will bounce back. The fact is, though, the world is a riskier place than it was not long ago, and China is one big reason for that.",News/World news,China’s struggle delights some – but should make us all nervous | Larry Elliott,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/15/china-struggle-delight-nervous-covid-threat-economy
5/15/2022,"Plans to shred parts of the Northern Ireland protocol “would send headlines around the world” that the UK is prepared to break treaties, Ireland’s foreign minister has said, as a British cabinet minister insisted the UK did not intend to break the law. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, said the UK had “the right to act in a sovereign way” and to “reopen or re-examine the protocol” but denied the actions would constitute a breach of international law. Boris Johnson will travel to Belfast on Monday, where he will vow not to scrap the protocol negotiated as part of the Brexit deal, and said he is only seeking reform that has “the broadest possible cross-community support”. In a move to put pressure back on parties at Stormont, Johnson will urge them to “get back to work” after the Democratic Unionists blocked the election of a Speaker at the Stormont assembly on Friday, meaning the assembly is unable to function. Signs that the government was rowing back its rhetoric on the protocol came amid mixed messaging over a trade war, with Johnson allies claiming he had a “conciliatory” call with Ireland’s taoiseach last week. However the Irish Times on Saturday reported Irish sources describing it as “the single worst call he has ever had with anyone”. On Sunday, Simon Coveney, Ireland’s foreign minister, “criticised sabre-rattling and grandstanding” from ministers over the past week, including reported plans by the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, for a bill on Tuesday which would unilaterally override parts of the protocol in order to lift checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea. Johnson has already been warned that dozens of Conservative MPs will attempt to stop the bill becoming law if it reaches the later stages – though many see it as a negotiating tactic. Coveney said the behaviour of UK ministers was “creating a lot of tension in my country, your closest neighbour, and also potentially being on the verge of making a decision that could fundamentally undermine the functioning of the institutions of the peace process in Northern Ireland”, he told Sophy Ridge on Sunday on Sky News. He said the majority of people in Northern Ireland were in favour of the protocol. “There is a minority, a large minority within unionism, who are unhappy with the protocol,” he said. “There are solutions that we can put in place that can ease that concern and that’s what we need to focus on doing together, as opposed to the British government acting on its own, illegally in a way that doesn’t reflect majority opinion in Northern Ireland and perhaps, most importantly, sends a message to the world that this British government when it suits them will set aside international law.” He said that the relations between Britain and Ireland were being fundamentally damaged because of “unhelpful briefings that we’re getting from very, very senior levels within the British government this week”. Coveney said the EU had not threatened any specific retaliation – though several European parliamentarians have said there will be consequences, including the potential suspension of the trade deal, should the UK government act unilaterally. “There’s no way the EU can compromise if the UK is threatening unilateral action to pass domestic legislation to set aside international obligations under an international treaty that, don’t forget, the UK was the primary designer of along with the EU,” he said. “We can get there to a landing zone if we work in partnership. But, you know, sabre-rattling and grandstanding in Westminster ratcheting up tension is not the way to do it.” Kwarteng said the UK had a right to act unilaterally contained within article 16 of the protocol – though sources close to Truss have briefed that invoking article 16 is not the route the government intends to take. “Political stability in Northern Ireland is our number one priority,” Kwarteng told Ridge. “We should be able to act in a sovereign way. Northern Ireland is as much part of the United Kingdom as England, Cornwall, the south-east, and we are responsible for that.” He said he did not think there would ultimately be a trade war with the EU and that any imposition of tariffs would be likely to take considerable time. “I don’t think there is going to be a trade war. There has been a lot of talk, a lot of threats about what the EU will or won’t do. That is up to them,” he told the BBC’s Sunday Morning programme. “As far as I am concerned, our primary duty as the British government is to look after political stability in Northern Ireland. If that means re-looking at the protocol, we absolutely have to do that. “I think this talk of a trade war is irresponsible and I think it is completely getting ahead of ourselves. It is up to the EU. We think it would be completely self-defeating if they went into a trade war, but that is up to them.”",News/Politics,Ireland says UK risks sending message it will break treaties in Brexit row,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/15/ireland-says-uk-risks-sending-message-it-will-break-treaties-in-brexit-row
5/15/2022,"The UK is preparing to celebrate the platinum jubilee weekend in style, with 1,458 public events and 1,775 street parties or private events officially registered to take place from 2 to 5 June. The celebrations are spread out across the country, with 240 in and around London, 208 around Manchester, 133 near Birmingham, 98 in Scotland – including four in the Orkneys and one on the Isle of Lewis – 21 in Northern Ireland and two in Guernsey. But the royal family’s platinum jubilee website is calling for more people to get involved. “There are lots of ways you can take part in the Queen’s platinum jubilee celebrations, whether you are a local authority, school, business, community group, or want to get involved yourself,” said a spokesperson for the site, which is offering a Toolkit To Plan Your Jubilee. It includes free photographs of the queen, children’s games, recipes and a free-to-download platinum playlist that includes Ed Sheeran, the Spice Girls, Kylie Minogue and Elton John. “The special extended bank holiday weekend will provide an opportunity for communities and people throughout the United Kingdom to come together to celebrate the historic milestone,” they added. The country will spend a total of £823m celebrating the bank holiday weekend, spending an average of £83 each on food, drink and union flag-inspired decorations, according to MoneySupermarket.com. That is almost three-quarters more than the £480m that 34% of Britons said they planned to spend celebrating the royal wedding in 2018. Waitrose has reported sales of Pimm’s are up by more than 260% on last year, while searches for “jubilee” are up 176% on their website in the past two weeks. Searches for platinum jubilee food and drink are up 114% and garden party recipe up 59%. John Lewis has similarly reported that searches for “jubilee” on its website are up 55% week on week. In a sign that street parties are already being organised, it said searches for outdoor chairs increased 33% compared with last month, with searches for bunting up 31%. B&Q said it had sold 100,000 metres of bunting, while Sainsbury’s reported sales of union jack cake stands were up by 2,783% week on week. The traditionally ironic English sense of humour is on show among the memorabilia available to mark the historic royal event: Mattel has launched a limited-edition Barbie doll inspired by the Queen, and several gnomes shaped like the Queen have gone on sale on eBay, as well as mini-sculptures of the Queen inside a snow globe that plays the national anthem – and corgi-shaped salt shakers. Amazon and Etsy are stocking solar-powered bobble heads shaped like the Queen and even a “Pin the Diamond on the Crown” game. In contrast, the public and private celebrations are largely steeped in tradition – albeit with a few unusual outliers: the South Bank in London will be holding an event to teach children to write punk songs and throwing an LGBTQI+ club night for insurgents with a “seditionary crew of abolitionists, unpardonables and ne’er-do-wells”. In Bristol, a hippy singer-songwriter called I-Sha-Vii on a self-proclaimed mission to make the people around her happier, will perform. Mainly, however, the festivities follow more time-honoured patterns: there will be a Make, Bake and Decorate a British Treat Box Fit for a Queen event in Manchester. Locals in Thornhill will cook pizza together. Bedale community library is throwing a tea party, while there will be a Picnic at the Pub in Shrewsbury. There will be a wildflower display and free flower arranging in Beddington, a child’s funfair in West Sussex, and readings of royal fairytales by author Sally Pomme Clayton based on her recent book The King with Dirty Feet. In Stoke Poges, there will be a Best of British Disco Karaoke. There will be fireworks as national charities and councils light the UK’s 1,500-plus community and commonwealth beacons – a long-held tradition of celebrating royal jubilees, weddings and coronations stretching from across the UK, Channel Islands, Isle of Man and UK Overseas Territories. The ceremony of lighting the beacons will begin at 9pm on Thursday 2 June when the principal beacon, involving The Tree of Trees – a 21-metre high “tree” constructed of 350 smaller trees – is lit in a special ceremony at Buckingham Palace. Members of Girlguiding will light a further 70 beacons up and down the country, while former servicemen and women from Walking with the Wounded have said their lights will shine on top of the highest peaks of each of the four nations in the UK.",News/UK news,UK preparing for Queen’s platinum jubilee with thousands of events,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/15/queen-platinum-jubilee-bank-holiday-weekend-thousands-of-events
5/15/2022,"Warnings that a new statue of Margaret Thatcher would attract egg throwing protests came true within two hours of it being installed in her home town of Grantham on Sunday. The bronze statue was, without ceremony, placed on a 3m (10ft) high plinth to make it more difficult for protesters to inflict any damage. Shortly afterwards a man was seen throwing eggs from behind a temporary fence and, when one connected, a cry of “oi” could be heard. The egg throwing came as a surprise to nobody in Grantham. There is pride but also heightened awareness of how divisive a figure she remains. After it was installed on a warm Sunday morning, a number of people stopped to take selfies. But loud booing could also be heard from passing motorists. Councillor Kelham Cooke, Conservative leader of South Kesteven council, said the statue was a fitting tribute to a unique political figure. “Margaret Thatcher will always be a significant part of Grantham’s heritage,” he said. “She and her family have close ties with Grantham. She was born, raised and went to school here.”He added: “It is, therefore, appropriate that she is commemorated by her home town, and that the debate that surrounds her legacy takes place here in Grantham. We must never hide from our history, and this memorial will be a talking point for generations to come. “We hope that this memorial will encourage others to visit Grantham and to see where she lived and visit the exhibition of her life in Grantham Museum. “This is about inspiring, educating and informing people about someone who represents a significant part of Grantham’s heritage.” The statue, made by sculptor Graham Jennings, was originally intended to stand close to parliament but it was rejected by Westminster Council in 2018. Councillors said it was too soon after her death, in 2013. They would also have been aware of the attack in 2002 on the marble statue of Thatcher in the Guildhall Art Gallery, in London. It was attacked with a cricket bat and decapitated with a metal bar in what a protester called “an act of satirical humour”. A court found him guilty of criminal damage and jailed him for three months. After Westminster’s refusal, the statue was offered to Grantham, with work to achieve that spearheaded by Grantham Community Heritage Association (GCHA), an educational charity which manages the museum. It has been a rocky road. There was horror when it was revealed that a £100,000 unveiling ceremony was being planned. A Facebook group proposed an “egg-throwing contest” which attracted 13,000 expressions of interest. That event was abandoned and in strikingly low-key fashion the statue was lowered into place on Sunday morning. An official unveiling by the Public Memorials Appeal (PMA), which funded the £300,000 statue through public donations, will, take place at a later date, the council said. Graham Jeal, a trustee of GCHA, said there had been a long conversation in Grantham about having a permanent memorial to Thatcher. “The delivery of the memorial has secured the museum for the next few years and has helped the museum finances survive the Covid pandemic,” he said. “It is recognised that the full spectrum of views exist in Grantham about the legacy of Margaret Thatcher and an exhibition inside the museum illustrates this.” The statue has been placed in St Peter’s Hill Green, close to the museum and the site of the grocer’s shop owned by Thatcher’s family.",News/Politics,Margaret Thatcher statue egged within hours of it being installed,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/15/margaret-thatcher-statue-grantham-egged-within-hours-of-it-being-installed
