2/8/2022,"The military train lurched into the rail depot at Kursk on a recent afternoon, carrying more snow-dusted main battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and other heavy weapons to within a few hours’ drive by car of the Ukrainian border. At the depot, the flatbed railcars parked between heavy containers carrying chemical products, leaving them visible only from a small pedestrian footbridge overhead. There, military police with red armbands kept watch as locals looked on curiously at the latest arrivals in Russia’s vast military buildup.  A recent trip by the Guardian to the Voronezh and Kursk regions in Russia found a hive of barely hidden military activity as Russian troops continue to position themselves for a potential assault on Ukraine, with new reports that personnel are being transferred and troops are leaving larger depots for forward staging areas just miles from the border. On the ground in Kursk and Voronezh, the capitals of their regions, which each sit about 100 miles from the border, the heightened military activity has become increasingly impossible to ignore. As jets roared overhead last week during a military training exercise, locals in Shilova, a district of Voronezh, were stunned to see a Pantsir air defence missile system emerge into a snowy field right next to the local primary school. (The western military district announced that it was just a training exercise.) In the nearby suburb of Maslovka, months of offloading of tanks, artillery and other equipment at a railway station has put local residents on edge. “My wife came back from her errands yelling about tanks, tanks, tanks,” said Oleg Romanenko, a mechanic and metal shop worker who lives near a main street in Maslovka, named for the 206th Rifle Division that fought in the second world war. “It is hard to walk outside your home and see this and not think a war could happen. Everyone has thought about it, at least.” Videos have begun surfacing of trains carrying Russian troops toward the front, and flight data suggests that troops from Siberia are also being airlifted towards Ukraine. Near the Kursk rail depot, air force officers cycled through a nearby spa hotel, while national guard military convoys seen as potential follow-on forces have been spotted driving through nearby towns as they make their way toward the border. Nonetheless, most of the activity points to the grand scope of Russia’s buildup, where an estimated half of the country’s battalion tactical groups has been moved to staging grounds within striking distance of Ukraine, sometimes just dozens of kilometres away from the border. US officials think that Russia has 70% of the necessary military equipment already positioned in order to launch an attack. “All of our red flags or checkboxes have been ticked in the past couple of weeks,” said a researcher from the open-source Conflict Intelligence Team (CIT), which has tracked Russian military deployments towards Ukraine. Those include the 200th Separate Motor Rifle Brigade, which departed its base above the Arctic Circle last month and which may have been the unit whose arrival was observed by the Guardian. The CIT researcher said their red flags include the movement of airborne troops and national guard troops, and the recent movement of equipment from a large military encampment in the town of Yelnya – he called it an “Oh crap” moment. “The evidence we have strongly suggests that literally every large ground formation of the Russian armed forces is involved in this,” the researcher said. “That’s literally unprecedented,” at least since the Soviet Union, they added. Despite the warning signs, some locals in Maslovka still view the buildup with an air of disregard. Videos of tanks and other weaponry arriving at the railway began to emerge in March and since then many have been convinced that the movement of heavy weaponry is just a defensive posture or a ploy in a high-stakes negotiation with the west. “We’ve got used to it here,” said Marina, a pensioner who was waiting at a bus stop off of the main street. She declined to give a surname. “[Troops] arrive and then in a few days they are gone again. Sometimes you see a few men in uniform. But we generally don’t [interfere], don’t ask questions. These are these kinds of times.” Security has certainly tightened since spring, when a Sky News crew managed to walk on to a new base in the Voronezh region being established for the arriving troops. Now, roads to large encampments in the area have been blocked off, locals said. And CIT researchers said that Russian railways had made it more difficult to track train data, increasing the importance of social media video uploaded to platforms like TikTok. Several people in Maslovka said there had been informal warnings not to speak with media or outsiders about the buildup or movements of military vehicles. At a local grocery store, a shopkeeper shrugged when the Guardian asked her about the tanks that would have been parked some 50 metres from her door a few days earlier. “I don’t know anything about that,” she said pointedly and moved into the back of the store. The neighbouring region of Kursk, which until recently had seen relatively little military activity, now had “a massive influx of vehicles and personnel,” wrote Konrad Muzyka in an examination of satellite photography of the region taken earlier this month. Videos taken from social media on Monday showed more tanks being transported south of Kursk by rail toward the border. Analysts said that an attack from this area could threaten the city of Kharkiv just across the border or could continue on to either cut off Ukrainian troops in the east or toward the capital of Kyiv. Kursk is historically associated with one of the largest and bloodiest tank battles of the second world war and some locals said it was unthinkable to imagine being on the frontline of a new conflict. “Everyone is interconnected, especially because of our family ties across the border,” said Larisa Kholtobina, the director of a local museum that focuses on preserving the memory of children who fought in the second world war. “There has been this [difficult] period … But we hope that things calm down.” “It’s just a few hundred kilometres from here” to the border, an assistant added. “We try not to think about it but we know that a war would touch us here too.”",News/World news,‘We don’t ask questions’: locals fear Russia’s military buildup on Ukraine border,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/07/we-dont-ask-questions-locals-fear-russias-military-buildup-on-ukraine-border
2/8/2022,"Mohamed Salah is expected to return to training with Liverpool on Tuesday as he looks to move on quickly from defeat in the Africa Cup of Nations final with Egypt. Liverpool’s leading goalscorer arrived back in England shortly after his country’s penalty shootout loss to Senegal in Cameroon on Sunday. He intends to join Jürgen Klopp’s players in a light recovery session on Tuesday and put himself in contention to face Leicester in the Premier League at Anfield on Thursday.  Salah’s involvement against Brendan Rodgers’ side is not guaranteed, with Liverpool waiting to assess the forward after his recent workload and heavy travel itinerary. But his availability is another fillip for Klopp with the team still involved in four competitions. Sadio Mané, who converted the winning penalty to seal Senegal’s first Africa Cup of Nations title, may not be back in England until Wednesday having taken part in a homecoming parade in Dakar on Monday. Liverpool coped comfortably in the absence of Salah and Mané, winning two Premier League games, reaching the Carabao Cup final at the expense of Arsenal and advancing to the fifth round of the FA Cup with victories over Shrewsbury and Cardiff.

2/8/2022,"Kirstie Allsopp has been examining why young people can’t afford to buy houses, making the following suggestions: they should move to cheaper areas; they should spend less time at the gym; they shouldn’t waste their money on a Netflix subscription. You don’t need me to point out the flaws in her arithmetic; that vital work has already been done, not least by young people. We all know that clashes between generations are the stupidest internecine conflicts humanity has ever been able to dream up. The only thing keeping them alive are these regular bulletins from the “things young people should stop buying if they want to afford homes” gazette.  It started in 2016, when an Australian demographer, Bernard Salt, criticised millennials for going to “hipster cafes”; by the following year, this had been distilled down to the quintessential hipster item, the avocado. If only they would forego their fruit/vegetable on toast, they would be able to save for a deposit. Though it started in Australia, this line, like a lie, had got halfway round the world before the truth – that it would take hundreds of years before your daily avocado savings would amount to a house – had got its pants on. Just as any coffee, so long as it was milky and Italian in genesis, came to stand in for “privileged metropolitan”, so the avocado effortlessly swelled to represent “any young person, without any defined range – so, for practical purposes, any person younger than me”. If you had coffee and avocado, that made you a privileged young person, and, therefore, in the world of food symbolism, beneath contempt, politically irrelevant. It didn’t make a whole load of sense, but it made more sense than going after their Netflix subscriptions. It’s a platform you would be as, if not more, likely to associate with the middle-aged, so it just reinforces, surely inadvertently, the underlying message that what the middle-aged have as their birthright, the young will never deserve. Allsopp should have gone after this generation for chilling. Even people who don’t know what “Netflix and chill” means still know that it’s a young person thing.

2/8/2022,"Andy Haldane, co-author of the government’s big levelling-up report, wants to pair a swathe of the UK’s major material needs with the thrust of achievements in Renaissance Florence (Report, 5 February). It would be difficult to entertain a more idiotic vision. Florence had no coordination between public expenditure and urban improvement. Taxation staggered from one need to the next. Churches and rich patrons were the prime movers behind all major architectural commissions. Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci deserted Florence for more promising venues. The Medici began to put their hands into the public till even under the 15th-century republic. Any conception of the public good was rudimentary. The political upper class swiftly made its peace with the overmighty Medici in the 16th century. Enough said.Lauro MartinesLondon   Levelling up isn’t just about a new bus route or train line, it’s about rebuilding the foundations of this country’s prosperity. At the heart of levelling up should be the reform of our education system. We need to teach creativity, which helps people solve problems. We need to value engineers and tradespeople such as electricians, plumbers and gas fitters, so we need more focus on those skills at ages of 16-plus. It’s ironic that the person in charge of levelling up is the one who took England’s education system back to learning by rote and destroyed what would really make a difference.Michael SandersLondon  One of the projects that will apparently receive funding in the white paper on levelling up (Report, 2 February) is money for the electrification of the Midland mainline north from Bedford to Sheffield. Some 15 years ago, I was a member of South Yorkshire Passenger Transport and I can remember councillors welcoming the news that the rail line up to Sheffield was to be electrified. Since then, this announcement has been trotted out a number of times, with a lengthy hiatus when we were promised an extension to the city from the proposed HS2 route to Leeds instead. Work is finally beginning on electrifying the line from Bedford to Market Harborough. Yet again, we are faced with a recycled project with recycled funds, the eventual completion of which stretches further and further into the future.Sylvia DunkleySheffield  Lisa Nandy is right to point to the vacuum at the heart of the levelling-up plans. Tagged on to the prosperous south-east, the Isle of Wight has been underfunded for decades in terms of money per pupil. We have had a gutful of education change and boast such a mosaic of secondary provision that it lacks coherence. Local housing is well beyond the means of residents thanks to second homes and holiday lets cornering the market. Our ferry links remain among the most expensive in the world. We are deprived of subsidies enjoyed by other coastal crossings. This has led to higher prices and less frequent crossings, which have affected social mobility and trade. We don’t need more of the same tired policies. We need levelling up of the money that we have been deprived of in the past and involvement of island people in their future.Yvonne WilliamsRyde, Isle of Wight  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2/8/2022,"Nesrine Malik colourfully describes the protracted demise of Boris Johnson as a “slow bleed, rather than an immediate fall” (This government has been built on a fantasy. Restoring reality will cost the Tories dear, 7 February). She rightly suggests that because the Conservative party narrative is built on lies, it will reframe the prime minister’s lies and allow him to live another day, and then another, and yet another. Those of us who have written to our local Conservative MPs about our distress at partygate and the flouting of rules seem to all have received replies with common phrases indicating that action is being taken to improve the operation at No 10. Not one word of contrition or recognition of the prime minister’s individual failings and personal responsibility.  In almost every conversation I have these days, both young and old share shock at the nonsense going on in parliament, and anxieties about the economic crisis, the rising cost of living and how they are going to manage. While this prime minister and his government bluster on, it is the rest of us who will experience the slow bleed of increasing prices, increased taxes, real incomes falling, further diminished public services and the removal of a safety net to catch us when we fall. All this government offers are sticking plasters when what we really need is major surgery.Peter RiddleWirksworth, Derbyshire  Nesrine Malik emphasises the need for the survival of some sort of credible Conservative party. Those of us who have never voted Conservative, and never will, should be hoping that the downfall of Boris Johnson does not leave behind a vacuum that a new Nigel Farage (or indeed the old one) will be only too happy to fill.

2/8/2022,"Once again, it’s remarkable to see how little is understood about the workings of capitalism by those who operate at the very top of it (Bank of England boss criticised for asking workers not to demand pay rise, 4 February). “The rich cannot buy great quantities of bread,” the economist JK Galbraith observed after the Wall Street crash of 1929 and America’s struggle to revive its economy. He meant that the goods and services that keep the high street (and its suppliers and manufacturers) going come from the everyday spending of the masses, not from the activities of the very few mega-rich speculators and rentiers who always end up causing volatility and boom and bust. While no one would want a return to the union militancy of the 1970s, it was pointed out at the time by some economists that at least the big pay rises to workers put money in their pockets to spend, which stopped the economy tilting into recession.  The real problems today come from high rents, a dysfunctional housing market and private sector greed. The average household is mired in personal or mortgage debt – a problem that wouldn’t have been so evident in the 1970s, but is certainly a problem today, as the Bank of England worries about the effects of raised interest rates.David RedshawGravesend, Kent  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2/8/2022,"My friend Mike Nally, who has died aged 83, made his name in journalism in the 1960s as a reporter for Granada Television’s Scene at 6.30 news programme and then for the BBC’s Look North. Later he was news editor at Radio Newcastle before returning to his print roots with the Observer, initially in London and then in Manchester as the paper’s northern correspondent until the late 90s. Mike was born in Crumpsall, Manchester, to Hilda (nee Clarkson), a civil servant, and her husband, Will Nally, a journalist and Labour MP for Bilston in the West Midlands from 1945 to 1955. Mike attended North Manchester grammar school for boys before going on to study politics at Manchester University.  His first job as a reporter was with the Stretford Journal, and he further honed his reporting skills on the Manchester Evening Chronicle, before moving to Granada. A man of the left with a distrust of the establishment and its institutions, Mike had an inquisitorial style of questioning that was rare in the media world of the 60s. On one occasion, in an encounter on the BBC Northwards slot, he reduced the corrupt politician T Dan Smith – at the time supremely confident in his command of the media and recently named the Architect Journal’s Man of the Year – to utter silence. However, Mike’s direct style of interviewing caused problems at the BBC and, after clashes with executives, he left Look North in 1970 to become news editor at Radio Newcastle, at the time one of the BBC’s more adventurous local radio stations. In 1973 he moved back into print journalism with the Observer in Manchester, from where he provided insights into regional industry and politics, as well as delightful cameo articles of north country life. In 1996 Mike moved into teaching journalism at the University of Central Lancashire in Preston, inspiring dozens of aspiring young journalists and bringing to that task – until retirement in 1996 – the same restless irreverence that had characterised his earlier work. In a typical moment teaching about public relations officers, he said: “My first reaction to a press release is: ‘what are the bastards trying to hide from me?’” He is survived by his wife, Brenda (nee Taylor), whom he married in 1963, their sons, Sean and Joel, and grandchildren Maya, Orla and Otis.",News/Media,Mike Nally obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/07/mike-nally-obituary

2/8/2022,"Members of the Gypsy, Roma and Traveller community have accused the government of hypocrisy after ministers condemned a Holocaust joke by Jimmy Carr while pushing through a raft of legislation hostile to their way of life.The Traveller Movement, which represents the GRT community, said it had been “surprised” by the government’s promises to better protect the community against hate speech following the backlash to Carr’s joke, in which he said the genocide of Romani and Sinti gypsies in the Holocaust is ignored because people don’t want to “focus on the positives”.Greg Sproston, policy and campaigns manager for the Traveller Movement, said the government was currently trying to pass three bills – on policing, nationality and borders and elections – all of which will “have disproportionately negative impacts” on the GRT community. He added that a national strategy to reduce inequality in the community announced over two years ago “still has not materialised”. “If the government is serious about protecting and supporting these communities, they would scrap this discriminatory legislation and bring forward the strategy without delay,” he said.  The policing bill is especially controversial within the GRT community as it would give police powers to move travellers’ camps if anyone complained, regardless of whether a crime had been committed. Billy Welch, the head gypsy and spokesman for the UK’s Roma population, said he is consulting lawyers to see if Carr could be prosecuted for inciting racial hatred. He said the comedian’s joke was offensive in part because of the legacy of trauma after between 200,000 and 2 million Romani and Sinti gypsies were murdered in the Holocaust. “There are many still living who witnessed the brutality of what happened, and many more who lost their families in barbarous and sadistic murders. Making a joke of it is too painful,” he said. The Traveller Movement has called on Netflix, which aired the His Dark Materials special containing the joke in December, to remove the gag and apologise. The group’s petition has gained thousands of signatories. The charity has also offered to help the platform amend its editorial guidelines to prevent a repeat of the incident. “It’s hard to over-stress the hurt and distress this causes,” Sproston said.Sproston said Carr’s joke demonstrated that the GRT community is consistently “seen as low-hanging fruit or a legitimate target”, and that many people do not understand that they are a defined ethnic minority whose rights are protected by law. He said one young Irish traveller told him “no matter what he achieved or where he is in life, as soon as he hears a comment like that it diminishes his progress and he’s back to square one, because it reminds him of everything society thinks about him”.A recent survey by University of Birmingham researchers found that 44% of people in the UK had negative attitudes towards GRT people, making them the “least liked group”, nearly double the level for Muslims, who were the second group to receive the most prejudice. Research by the Traveller Movement in 2017 found that 91% of GRT people had experienced discrimination, which it described as “the last acceptable form of racism”. These attitudes have a profound impact on areas such as employment and education, where GRT people underperform, and the criminal justice system, where they are over-represented. Carr has defended the joke as raising awareness of the genocide of an estimated 25-50% of Europe’s population of Roma and Sinti gypsies, and some commenters have suggested it may have been intended ironically to highlight prejudice against the GRT community. However, Sproston said the audience’s laughter and some reactions on social media show that anti-GRT attitudes are so deeply entrenched that many took the joke at face value, which could further harm an already deeply disadvantaged community. Rosa Cisneros, a member of the GRT community who researches Romani culture at Coventry University, said she was “sad but not surprised” by Carr’s joke. “This situation has highlighted that anti-Gypsyism and Romaphobia still exists today. For me, it isn’t about censoring Jimmy Carr or being offended or me being part of the ‘woke’ brigade that I want to just cancel a show or infringe on someone’s freedom of speech and his rights. No, I am utterly horrified that we live in a space where such harmful and hateful speech is accepted and seen as a joke.”",Arts/Culture,Roma accuse government of hypocrisy over Jimmy Carr joke,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/07/romas-accuse-government-of-hypocrisy-over-jimmy-carr-joke
2/8/2022,"The Virginia governor, Glenn Youngkin, was accused of creating “a culture of toxicity” in his first months in office, after campaign aides attacked a high-school student, naming and picturing the boy, for sharing a news story about the Republican official. On Saturday, Ethan Lynne, 17 and according to his Twitter biography a Democrat, posted an article which suggested Youngkin could be trying to stop work to highlight the history of enslaved people at the Virginia executive mansion.  In response, Youngkin’s campaign account posted a picture of Lynne with the former governor Ralph Northam, next to a picture from Northam’s medical school yearbook of two men in racist costumes: one in Blackface and one in a Ku Klux Klan costume. “Here’s a picture of Ethan with a man that had a Blackface/KKK photo in his yearbook,” Team Youngkin tweeted. In 2019, Northam admitted being one of the men in the photograph, an admission he later recanted. Glenn Youngkin’s campaign Twitter account attacked a Hanover County high school student, @ethanclynne, last night after he shared my story. The Tweet was deleted after blowback and I’ve asked Youngkin’s team for an explanation. Ethan says he hasn’t heard anything from them. pic.twitter.com/YWMmLCOQys Virginia governors cannot serve consecutive terms. Youngkin beat the Democrat Terry McAuliffe, a former governor, in a bitter 2021 election in which the Republican made teaching about race and racism in US history a key campaign issue. Amid outrage at an attack on a minor, the Team Youngkin tweet was deleted. Speaking to the Washington Post, Lynne said: “A governor’s campaign account has attacked a minor – to me that was a new low … it was up for over 12 hours. I received no apology, no communication, nothing.” On Monday, Youngkin said: “On Saturday night, an unauthorized tweet came from a campaign account. I regret that this happened and it shouldn’t have. I have addressed it with my team. We must continue to work to bring Virginians together. There is so much more that unites us than divides us.” Lynne said: “While he acknowledged the situation, Governor Youngkin did not apologize and did not condemn what happened over the weekend. I still hope he does, and that he will take time to recognize the culture of toxicity he has created within his first month of office.” A Youngkin campaign spokesman, Matt Wolking, said the tweet was deleted when it was realised Lynne was a minor. Lynne’s Twitter biography reads: “Virginian. HS Senior. Democrat.” “It was brought to [our] attention that this Democrat party official repeatedly elevated by [state] senator Louise Lucas as a source of official Democrat party communications is actually a minor, so the tweet was removed,” Wolking said. The article Lynne posted was from VPM, a public radio station in Richmond, the state capital. It alleged Youngkin was converting a classroom in the executive mansion, used to educate on ties between the building and slavery, into a family room. The article also said an archeologist and historian who worked with the two previous governors had her office cleaned out. Lynne tweeted: “NEW: The historian tasked with teaching about slavery at the Virginia Governors Mansion just resigned after finding Youngkin converted her classroom into a family room – and emptied her office.” He added: “Shameful.” Corrections were later posted, saying Youngkin had not converted the classroom and the historian had resigned, but did seem to have had her office cleaned out. Lynne retweeted the correction. Nonetheless, the Youngkin campaign team attacked. Lynne said he did not notice their tweet for hours. “In school, we are taught how to spot bullying, and their tweet last night perfectly fit that description,” Lynne wrote on Sunday, also thanking people who offered support. “It is disgusting, disturbing, and unbecoming of the commonwealth to see the governor and his office stoop this low, especially on a public platform.”",News/US news,Governor Glenn Youngkin accused of ‘toxic culture’ after aides attack teen on Twitter,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/07/virginia-governor-glenn-youngkin-aides-attack-teen-on-twitter
2/8/2022,"For more than a week, the centre of Canada’s capital city has been paralysed by protestors who have blockaded the downtown area with trucks and cars. City police have described the protest as a “siege” and on Sunday the mayor of Ottawa declared a state of emergency.  In early January, a relatively unknown group called Canada Unity announced they would be launching a “freedom convoy” to protest vaccine passports and mandates installed by various levels of government in Canada. This group has unsuccessfully tried to launch such a convoy before, but this time, things took off thanks to frustration with a new requirement that all truckers crossing the US-Canada border must be vaccinated against Covid-19. While the vast majority of Canadian truckers are vaccinated, there were fears that forcing any number of truckers off the job could worsen supply chain pressures. Some trucks travelled more than 5,000km to reach Ottawa, where the convoy started to arrive on January 28. After pulling into Ottawa, the convoy has morphed into a rolling protest in Ottawa’s downtown core. Trucks and cars roamed through the city, laying on their horns and snarling traffic. Bands of protesters wandered the city, many pushing their way into malls and businesses – maskless, despite a provincial requirement that face coverings be worn indoors. The size of the protest swelled to roughly 10,000 over its initial weekend, but declined significantly and last week, the protest became an occupation. More than 100 trucks sat parked on the main thoroughfare in front of Canada’s parliament buildings. Protesters built a makeshift kitchen and a well-coordinated delivery network brought in hundreds of jerry cans of diesel to those running low on fuel. While there are certainly some members of the convoy who are in Ottawa to protest the trucker vaccine mandate, convoy members raise a varied list of complaints. Canada Unity, which operates as an umbrella organization for many of the protesters, is collecting signatures for its “memorandum of understanding”, a document that demands the Canadian government rescind all vaccine requirements or “RESIGN their lawful positions of authority immediately”. The group’s founder, James Bauder – who has written on Facebook that Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, ought to be tried for treason, and who has endorsed the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory – insists that, should the document get enough signatures, an election will be triggered. Joining Canada Unity is a motley crew of anti-vaccine and rightwing activists. Tamara Lich, who has coordinated a wildly successful GoFundMe, and Pat King, who has coordinated with many of the truckers, were involved in efforts to declare the oil-rich Western provinces’ independence from Canada. Others who have latched on to the movement include QAnon figure Romana Didulo, the self-proclaimed “Queen of Canada”. Speakers and protesters have rejected the science behind vaccines, called for Trudeau’s arrest and trial, and waved Nazi and confederate flags. The protesters say they will not leave Ottawa until all vaccine requirements and mandates have been abolished, a demand that is very unlikely to be met. Some have gone further and said they will camp out until Trudeau leaves office. The truckers have become a cause celebre for anti-vaccine groups and rightwing influencers. Their cause has been heralded by Elon Musk, Donald Trump, Tucker Carlson, and a host of others. Bauder’s memorandum of understanding has now collected about 300,000 signatures, while the occupiers’ GoFundMe surpassed CAD$10m ($7.88m USD) – of that, CAD$1m was released to cover expenses, while the remainder was returned to the donors after GoFundMe determined the protest violated their terms of service. That decision led Florida’s governor, Ron Desantis, to pledge an investigation of the company for alleged “fraud”. Other fundraisers have quickly made up the difference: another crowdfunding effort pulled in nearly CAD$500,000, while a Bitcoin fundraiser has already raised nearly 9 BTC ($389,955). The Canadian public has been less supportive. Polling data suggests that roughly a third of the country has a positive impression of the truckers, but that number seems to be falling as the occupation wears on. Canada has one of the world’s highest rates of vaccination against Covid-19, and vaccine mandates remain broadly popular. Ottawa residents are growing particularly hostile and resentful after days of disruption. A class action lawsuit has been filed, seeking damages of nearly CAD$10m over the incessant horn blaring that has disrupted daily life for the thousands of residents who live near the occupation zone. Ottawa police have called in backup from other police forces around the province, but the chief, Peter Sloly, has confessed that they are woefully outnumbered. While the crowd numbers may not be terribly impressive, they have a physical advantage thanks to their vehicles. Police have increasingly laid fines and charges for mischief, and recently began blocking fuel deliveries to the occupiers – but it hasn’t broken the occupation yet. There’s little chance that the Trudeau government will acquiesce to the protesters’ demands – indeed, most of the vaccine requirements are administered at the provincial level, outside federal jurisdiction. Ottawa’s mayor, Jim Watson, is encouraging the federal government to appoint a mediator to find common ground with the protesters, but given their extreme demands, a compromise seems unlikely. Ottawa police are unlikely to clear the occupation by force. They may begin laying more fines against the occupiers – but their impressive fundraising haul means they can withstand significant financial penalties. Morale in the encampment has only been boosted by solidarity convoys to provincial capitals in Toronto and Quebec City, and planned convoys across the United States, Europe and Australia.",News/World news,Ottawa protests: how did the rallies against vaccine mandates begin and what’s next?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/07/ottawa-protests-explainer-vaccine-mandates-whats-next
2/8/2022,"The supermarket chain Asda has committed to making its cheapest food ranges more widely available, after the anti-poverty campaigner Jack Monroe raised concerns that low-income shoppers were facing price increases because they could no longer get hold of them. The retailer said it had taken onboard Monroe’s comments and would stock its full Smart Price and Farm Stores ranges in all 581 food stores and online, increasing the number of customers who have access to the products.  Some of the deals, which include 1kg bags of rice for 45p and tins of chopped tomatoes for 28p, had been taken off the website and removed from some stores as the supermarket streamlined its offer. But last month Monroe pointed out that some shoppers were in effect facing triple-digit inflation because they were no longer able to buy products from these ranges and had to buy more expensive basics. In one example she gave of an unnamed retailer, the cheapest 1kg bags of rice had been removed from the shelves, and the next alternative was a 500g pack costing £1, which worked out at a 344% increase. She added that in her local Asda, the cheapest bag of pasta was no longer a 29p bag from the Smart Price range but an own-brand version costing 70p – a 141% price rise. Asda said 150 value-range products were stocked in 300 stores currently, and by 1 March it would introduce all 200 of them across its outlets. This week it increased the number available online by 100 to 187, and it will add more by the end of the month. Meg Farren, Asda’s chief customer officer, said: “We want to help our customers’ budgets stretch further and have taken onboard the comments about the availability of our Smart Price range made by Jack Monroe. We are taking steps to put our full Smart Price and Farm Stores ranges in store and online to make these products as accessible as possible.” The rising cost of energy bills and food is putting household budgets under pressure, and Monroe raised concerns that headline inflation figures do not capture the impact on those with the least money to spend. She has set up her own index to track the cost of essentials, which she said would “document the disappearance of the budget lines and the insidiously creeping prices of the most basic versions of essential items at the supermarket”. After she launched the campaign last month, the Office for National Statistics said it accepted that every person had their own inflation rate and it would do more to capture the impact of price increases on different income groups. Monroe welcomed the move, tweeting: “Delighted to be able to tell you that the @ONS have just announced that they are going to be changing the way they collect and report on the cost of food prices and inflation to take into consideration a wider range of income levels and household circumstances.”",News/Business,Asda to make cheapest food ranges more widely available,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/07/asda-to-make-cheapest-food-ranges-more-widely-available-jack-monroe
2/8/2022,"An independent study has linked the deaths of thousands of crabs and lobsters and a mystery dog illness to dredging for the government’s flagship freeport on Teesside – a key to the Conservative’s post-Brexit, “levelling-up” agenda. The report has led local fishers to reject a government theory that an “algal bloom” is responsible for the huge piles of dead crustaceans that began washing up on beaches along England’s north-east coast in October.  A multi-agency investigation led by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) concluded on Friday that the mass crustacean deaths, which the fishing industry says have threatened their livelihoods and led to fears of a collapsing ecosystem, “potentially resulted from a naturally occurring harmful algal bloom”. Algal blooms are a rapid overgrowth of algae that can produce dangerous toxins in the water, sometimes marked by a coloured scum on the water. Scientists have warned that they are becoming more frequent and more toxic worldwide, and could be linked to the climate crisis. Tim Deere-Jones, an independent marine pollution consultant and author of the report, said there was “no empirical evidence to support the theory that it’s got anything to do with an algal bloom”. Deere-Jones, who has 30 years of experience around dredging issues as a consultant, instead said the data obtained via freedom of information requests from Defra and other agencies, linked the mass mortalities to a specific chemical, pyridine, which can be released into the environment as a waste product from industrial processes. “So far, the available evidence points clearly to pyridine as a potential cause of the mortality,” he said. His analyses point to several potential sources of pyridine discharge to the estuary, which could date back decades, but has embedded deep into the seabed. “On the basis of the established fact that pyridine preferentially deposits out into estuarine sediments, rather than remains in the water column, it seems likely that the new deeper dredging being constructed has uncovered and redistributed pyridine-laced sediments to the regional marine environment,” he added. While Defra said that “any levels [of pyridine] detected in crab tissue are likely to be linked to biological processes and not necessarily from the environment”, Deere-Jones pointed out that samples from control crabs collected in Penzance had just under 6mg per kilogram of the toxic chemical, the Saltburn crabs were found to have more than 400mg per kg. “That’s not a natural level, that’s a human impact level,” he said. Defra, which reviewed satellite date showing an algal bloom along the coastal area in late September 2021, rejected this explanation, concluding it is “unlikely that chemical pollution, sewage or infectious aquatic animal diseases were the cause of the deaths”. The agency also said there was no evidence linking recent reports of dead seals, the mystery dog illness causing sickness and diarrhoea following walks along the coast in January, or the dead sea birds washing up in their hundreds in October. However, the North East Fishing collective, a group of commercial fishing associations, angling societies, conservationists and stakeholders along the north-east coast of England, have labelled the explanation as “utter rubbish”. The group say they have all been “dramatically impacted by the recent events on the east coast. Our incomes have been slashed, our livelihoods under threat and our environments eroded.” Fishers from Hartlepool to Scarborough say their catch of crab and lobsters remain 80%-95% down and dead crabs and lobsters were reported last week in Saltburn and Maske, which they say is unlikely to have been caused by an algal bloom in October. Following a protest last November, the group set up a crowdfunder and commissioned Deere-Jones to investigate. They have called for further investigations into the high levels of pyridine found in crabs and an immediate stop to dredging activity in the Tees, where they say one vessel “conducted a years’ worth of dredging in 10 days”. A spokesperson for the fishers said algal blooms “do not occur naturally in our coastal waters in October. The temperatures are far too low” and demanded more evidence for the theory beyond satellite images. A Defra spokesperson said: “Our sampling established that no pyridine was present in the water or sediment samples we collected but was detected in crab tissue from both impacted areas and non-impacted areas elsewhere in the country”.",News/Environment,Study links crab deaths and dog illness to dredging for Teesside freeport,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/07/study-links-crab-deaths-and-dog-illness-to-dredging-for-teesside-freeport
2/8/2022,"Frank Lampard has said he will judge Dele Alli on what he produces for Everton and not on his choice of clothes or car. The new signing has received strange criticism since his deadline day move from Tottenham with Alan Brazil questioning his use of a Rolls-Royce and former England manager Glenn Hoddle faulting the clothes he wore at Goodison Park on Saturday.  While admitting the pundits have a right to their opinion, the new Everton manager insisted he would not “handcuff” the midfielder’s personality and is more concerned with the 25-year-old’s efforts to relaunch his career at Goodison than lifestyle choices. Alli, and fellow new recruit Donny van de Beek, are both in the Everton squad for the Premier League trip to fellow strugglers Newcastle on Tuesday. Lampard said: “I’ve heard some of the reaction and I have a lot of respect for everyone who has spoken, ex-players who admire in Ally McCoist, Alan Brazil, Glenn Hoddle; I would never go against their word. But when you are working closely with players and working with Dele, my personal opinion is that I don’t care what car he drives, what clothes he wears, as long as I get a lad that comes to training every day, wants to improve every day, respects the club and respects his teammates and then produces and gives everything to produce. “The modern day has moved on, it’s changed, we all have to be aware of that, and I’m not hitting back at any former players’ observations because everyone is allowed their own opinion but I can only deal with what’s in front of me. Dele and Donny are both great lads, I mean it. Maybe Donny wears an overcoat that is longer than the one Dele wears, and he has a different type of jacket, but it doesn’t bother me. As long as they produce on the pitch then I’m very happy. “Everyone has their own individual personality and to try to handcuff or restrict that I think could be detrimental. As long as the players have the right behaviours when it comes to football and doing the right things I have no worries.”",Sport/Football,‘I don’t care what he wears’ – Frank Lampard hits back at Dele Alli criticism,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/07/i-dont-care-what-he-wears-frank-lampard-hits-back-at-dele-alli-criticism

There was admittedly plenty of that at the City Ground as Nottingham Forest stormed to a 4-1 win over Leicester but one fan got his #limbs all wrong in the aftermath of Forest’s third goal, his legs tottering him on to the pitch, his arms flailing haymakers at the Forest players as they celebrated Joe Worrall’s strike.

2/8/2022,"Taxpayers have been paying more than $10,000 a month for George Christensen’s “e-material” in the same period that he racked up an $85,000 Facebook advertising bill for issues including vaccine discrimination, and a conspiracy theory about the “unelected global elite”. According to reports from the independent parliamentary expenses authority, Christensen claimed more than $50,000 for “e-material” over nine months in 2021, with the spend ramping up to an average of $11,000 a month from the middle of the year.  Over the past 18 months, Christensen has spent $85,000 on Facebook ads. Government records show Christensen claimed $12,641 for e-material in the second quarter of last year, jumping to $33,500 in the third quarter as the controversial Queensland MP began ramping up his campaign against vaccine mandates. While the records do not indicate exactly how the money was spent, Facebook’s records show Christensen spending significant sums on advertising on the platform in the same period. The expense reports are not yet available for the October to December period, but Facebook’s ad library shows Christensen spent a similar amount for the last quarter of the year, including an estimated $25,000 on a single ad that calls to “end the vaccine discrimination”. The ad is a “demand [for] an end to all coercive measures by government and private corporations that force people to take a COVID-19 vaccine or else be denied services, rights or employment”. According to Facebook, the ad ran from November to January and had an audience reach of more than 1 million people. He has also spent more than $10,000 on other anti-vaccine mandate advertisements, calling for an end to vaccine passes and passports, which he describes as “medical apartheid” and a “path to tyranny”. Two separate ad campaigns costing up to $7,500 that ran from August through to December campaigned on the issue of “globalist elites”, who Christensen claims are using the pandemic “as an opportunity to fuse socialism and corporatism and embed it permanently into our economy and society”. “In other words, an unelected global elite operating outside the law deciding for ordinary citizens how they will live, work, communicate and do business in the future.” The ads, which had a reach of more than 800,000, link to one of Christensen’s websites which repeats key themes of the “great reset” conspiracy that has taken hold among rightwing groups in the US and Europe and targets “elites from the World Economic Forum”. The website says the great reset “sounds like a conspiracy theory but it’s not”. He also spent up to $5,000 on an advertisement promoting his private member’s bill which would have required doctors to provide assistance to foetuses with signs of life during an abortion. The ads had an estimated audience size of more than a million people. Christensen’s commentary has become more controversial in the months since he announced he would not re-contest the Mackay-based seat of Dawson at the next federal election. Guardian Australia reported last month that he had privately registered a business name and new website calling on people to “fight for our sovereignty”, fuelling speculation the outspoken MP was preparing to launch a new media brand. He told a Prayer and Pushback event last month he would not leave politics after the election and would probably “step back” into the media landscape. Under parliamentary expense rules, MPs can claim taxpayer funds for expenses for the dominant purpose of conducting parliamentary business. This includes electoral duties, which have a broad definition prescribed by the minister, including “facilitating and participating in debate” on matters of interest to constituents. A spokesperson for the Department of Finance said it would not comment on the use of expenses by individual senators and members. “Parliamentarians are allocated an annual budget for office expenses which can be used for the cost of communications, including e-communications,” the spokesperson said. “All office expenses must be for the dominant purpose of conducting parliamentary business. “Parliamentarians must personally certify that their use of office expenses complies with the PBR Act and Regulations.” Christensen did not respond to questions from Guardian Australia, including as to whether the ads were funded by his e-communications budget. Over the weekend, Christensen attended a large anti-vaccination rally in Canberra, posting a live stream of himself at the event saying he was attending along with people from “all walks of life”. The Nationals deputy leader, David Littleproud, said on Monday that Christensen was a “free spirit”, who had the right to demonstrate, but he did not agree with him and did not think he should have attended. “I’m not sure what his role was in that rally, but I don’t think it’s appropriate that he’s out there putting a message against medical advice – that’s not responsible and that’s irresponsible. And people need to understand that they should only take their advice from their doctor. “Obviously we are trying to make sure that George understands the important role and privilege that he has in being a member of parliament. You should take that seriously and we shouldn’t be giving medical advice, only doctors should.” Christensen was forced to step down from a committee role last month after he urged parents not to vaccinate their children. The call attracted a rare rebuke from the prime minister, Scott Morrison, who called Christensen’s views “dangerous” and advised people to ignore him.",News/Australia news,"George Christensen claims $10,000 a month for ‘e-material’ as he ramps up anti-vaccine mandate Facebook ads",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/08/george-christensen-claims-10000-a-month-for-e-material-as-he-ramps-up-anti-vaccine-mandate-facebook-ads
2/8/2022,"Australian electricity providers have been ranked on their climate credentials in a new consumer guide that aims to cut through “greenwash”. Greenpeace’s 2022 Green Electricity Guide, released on Tuesday, assessed 48 Australian energy retailers on six main criteria: providing renewable energy, ending coal use by 2030, halting fossil fuel expansion, supporting new renewable energy, transparency of marketing and pollution and environmental harm. Then, each provider was given a score out of five stars and ranked.  This is the first time the guide has been updated since 2018. Glenn Walker, a senior energy campaigner at Greenpeace and author on the 2022 guide says that the researchers placed more emphasis on “cutting through the greenwash and spin” when producing the update. This included reviewing provider websites and marketing materials to “assess how upfront they are with where their energy comes from”. Tim Baxter, senior researcher of climate solutions at Climate Council, says helping consumers see past marketing efforts is important . “Electricity is the most complicated system that most of us never have to think about,” he says. “That makes it difficult for a consumer to know what is happening when they flick their light switch on. A complicated system makes that extremely easy for any provider that is looking to pull the wool over their customers’ eyes.” Australia’s energy giants make up the bottom of the ranks. “They are the worst polluters, and are the companies people should be switching away from,” Walker says. AGL, Australia’s biggest provider, scored one star, placing “dead last” behind Origin and Energy Australia, which also scored one star. The score is a precipitous drop from AGL’s fifth place in 2018, but Walker says the result is “no surprise”. Owning and running “huge, dirty coal burning power stations” is just part of the problem. Walker says a greater worry is these providers are “not moving fast enough to retire those power stations”. “The science is very clear. We know now that Australia cannot burn coal beyond 2030. Any company planning to burn coal beyond that should be heavily marked down.” In a statement, AGL did not directly address its ranking, but said: “As the country’s largest electricity generator and retailer, we recognise our significant role in Australia’s energy transition.” The statement outlined a number of AGL’s renewable projects and investments, and said, “today we operate the largest portfolio of renewable assets of any ASX-listed company”. “We have been focused on our commitment to transition to net zero.” However, Walker calls AGL “the greenwash case in point”. “Most of their ads feature solar and windfarms. They give the impression that they are a leader of clean and green energy. They say they will get to net zero by 2050 as a company. But they want to continue mining and burning coal right up until 2048.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The AGL statement continued: “There is no doubt that coal fired generation will exit the system earlier than previously expected enabling a faster decarbonisation pathway. However this must happen as part of a coordinated plan across governments, industry, regulators and the community. Without this we create market uncertainty and put at risk energy reliability and customer affordability.” “Encouragingly, since the 2018 report there has been a race to the top,” Walker says. The guide’s top billed retailers are “pure-play renewable electricity companies” who are investing heavily in renewable energy. “They are not involved in mining fossil fuels, and are really transparent about their business. From every angle we assess them, they are helping transform our energy system to make it cleaner and greener.” Enova Energy and Diamond Energy “stood out with five star ratings,” taking the top two positions. Diamond Energy operates solar and wind energy plants, while Enova Energy contract only renewable energy from electricity generators, and harness excess energy from customers’ rooftop solar panels. In 2018, Powershop ranked first place in the guide. It has fallen to 10th place this year, after its acquisition by fossil fuel giant Shell in 2021. Six thousand of Powershop’s customers reportedly switched providers after the acquisition. That demonstrates “a strong consumer concern” in the role their provider plays in the climate crisis, Walker says. With a “bewildering array of choices out there in terms of energy providers,” head of the University of New South Wales school of photovoltaic and renewable energy engineering, professor Alister Sprout, says the Greenpeace Guide is “useful advice for consumers”. However, Dr Hedda Ransan-Cooper, who leads the social science program within the battery storage and grid integration program of Australian National University’s college of engineering and science, is wary of putting responsibility on the consumer. “There is a real lack of leadership from the government on solutions and pathways forward to how the transition should unfold,” she says. “Not everybody has the time, or capacity, to do levels of research and shop around for energy.” While Ransan-Cooper trusts “a proportion of active, engaged people” will make decisions based on the guide, she questions “how many people it is reaching”. Walker says the ultimate goal is to “provide consumers with an easy-to-use tool”. With one of the most polluting electricity grids in the world, “we should hold our government to account … But people can be empowered to take action too.” “The quicker we switch, the better it is for prices, and the quicker we will see Australian climate pollution drop,” he says. “Both benefit consumers, and consumers can be at the forefront of that.”",News/Australia news,‘Cutting through the greenwash’: Australian energy retailers ranked on climate action,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/08/cutting-through-the-greenwash-australian-energy-retailers-ranked-on-climate-action
2/8/2022,"The contrast in fortunes could hardly have been more distinct. On one side of the stage was Ange Postecoglou, basking in the adoration of 60,000 Celtic fans after an Old Firm triumph, and Alen Stajčić, brow furrowed in concentration, as his underdog Philippines advanced to the semi-finals of the Asian Cup. On the other was Graham Arnold, glumly musing on belief, hard work and goal differences as the Socceroos’ chances of automatic qualification for Qatar 2022 were all but ended, and Tony Gustavsson putting a brave face on the Matildas’ disastrous elimination from the Asian Cup and speaking of effort, learning and his belief that he could bounce back. The dichotomy was obvious enough that it quickly became a key part of the fallout of a calamitous week; the inference being that had the former pair remained in charge of the national teams, or if Gustavsson and Arnold had not been put there, things would have been vastly different. This just might be accurate, but it could also be widely off the mark. The handy thing about hypotheticals is that they never need to be proven right or wrong. But there has certainly been some level of revisionism surrounding both national teams’ history as of late.  Yet judging how Australian football continuously confronts times of crisis, it is likely that most of those making the comparison would not actually care much for diving into the details of how their thought experiment would play out. The fun is more about revelling in the contrast, and Australian football is good at finding those. Beyond more obvious binary talking points, seemingly every few years there are reforms, initiatives or principles that are primarily sold as what needs to be done to put an end to an old era and begin a new one, or a review or inquiry that stands apart from all the others with its ability to “get things done”. This means a focus on outcomes. If a side consistently plays flawed football but keeps winning – perhaps a world-record 11 times in a row – things are good. If that team plays the same way but results suddenly dry up, that’s bad. The underlying condition is largely the same, but that was obscured by the contrasting outcomes being delivered. A major review is needed, but only now that World Cup qualification looks unlikely. For the Matildas, if one of their numerous chances against South Korea were not squandered and they progressed to the semi-finals, the conversation surrounding Gustavsson would very likely be significantly different – despite his principles of play remaining unchanged. This discourse largely ignores the long, slow and often unseen processes that actually go into delivering these outcomes. These steps are instead the domain of the ego, a regulator that doesn’t tend to attract media coverage, likes, shares or backslaps. With this in mind, should Arnold and Gustavsson remain in their positions? There are cases that could be made by Football Australia that they should not. The former has always been one of the most polarising figures in Australian football and given how long he has been around, there is scant reason to believe a rabbit is going to be pulled from a hat. Defendants of the latter, meanwhile, have not exactly put forward many football-based reasons for his retention. While there has been significant discussion on the challenges he is juggling heading into 2023, there has been much less on whether he has demonstrated a skill-set that will be needed to overcome them. But what does the ego say? Would these dismissals be a sound decision born of an in-depth analysis by technical staff that recognise how Australia are playing and what they need to do to play the way they want? Would there be a meticulous, dispassionate search for a replacement that would tangibly improve Australia’s style and approach? Given that FA arrived at Arnold and Gustavsson in the first place and has had an interim technical director for years – one that juggles the role with coaching two different junior national teams – those signs are not promising. And maybe, that’s the real issue at play here: there is not enough ego in Australian football.",Sport/Football,Australian football must broaden its scope if Socceroos and Matildas are to exit current mire | Joey Lynch,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/08/australian-football-must-broaden-its-scope-if-socceroos-and-matildas-are-to-exit-current-mire
2/8/2022,"Voters are less angry about the Morrison government’s handling of the pandemic than they were a fortnight ago, but a majority of respondents think the definition of full vaccination needs to be three jabs, not two, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. The survey of 1,069 voters has 40% of the sample (up from 35% a fortnight ago) rating Scott Morrison’s pandemic management as good, while 34% of respondents (down from 38%) characterised it as poor.  But while the prime minister on Monday confirmed Australia’s international border would be reopened from 21 February for double vaccinated tourists and travellers – 57% of poll respondents think the definition of fully vaccinated in Australia needs to be three jabs, not two (31% say it should be two and 12% are undecided). The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has been lobbying to change the current definition of full vaccination during recent national cabinet deliberations, but there has been no shift yet. The next national cabinet meeting is this Friday. Morrison said the definition of fully vaccinated for international tourists would remain at two doses, even if the definition changed domestically, because the chief medical officer had advised two doses was “sufficient”. Compulsion around vaccinations remains a politically fraught issue for the Coalition, with an insurgency building on the party’s right flank. With federal parliament resuming on Tuesday for a two-week sitting, Morrison is facing rolling public protests against vaccine mandates in Canberra. A major rally is planned at parliament house on Tuesday, and the parliamentary leader of the United Australia Party, Craig Kelly, has signalled he could sign protesters into the building. Two government MPs, George Christensen and Gerard Rennick, have also indicated they will address the protests. The prime minister has just endured a horror week. Last Tuesday, Morrison was blindsided when the Network 10’s political editor, Peter van Onselen, used a televised question and answer session at the National Press Club to reveal private criticism of the prime minister shared between the former New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian and an unnamed federal ministerial colleague. Then it was revealed late last week that Barnaby Joyce labelled Morrison “a hypocrite and a liar” in a private text message sent before he returned to the leadership of the National party. After the damaging leak, Morrison and Joyce closed ranks and characterised their relationship as amicable and productive. Morrison is attempting to rally his troops for an election within months. The latest Guardian Essential survey has the Coalition on a primary vote of 37% and Labor on 35% with the Greens on 9%, One Nation on 4%, independents on 5%, the United Australia party on 2% – with 8% of respondents undecided. Voting intention figures calculated by Guardian Essential now express the head-to-head metric of the major party contest as two-party preferred “plus”. This change in methodology, adopted after the 2019 election, highlights the proportion of undecided voters in any survey, providing accuracy on the limits of any prediction. Labor is on 47%, the Coalition on 46%, with 8% of respondents undecided in the latest two party preferred “plus” measure. Earlier in the summer, with Morrison under heavy political fire because of pandemic management missteps, Labor’s lead blew out to 50% to 43% on 2PP+ with 8% undecided. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Guardian Essential has only been publishing the head-to-head metrics on a quarterly basis since the last federal election. But given the proximity of the contest, these figures will now be reported fortnightly. As well as a modest rally for Morrison during the past fortnight, the latest poll suggests the NSW Perrottet government has also recovered some of its lost standing with voters after the significant surge in new Covid cases and deaths during the Omicron summer. In mid-December, 54% of respondents approved of the state government’s management of Covid-19, but that crashed to 37% by the end of January. In the latest data, 44% of respondents rate the state government’s response as good. State governments in Queensland and South Australia also saw positive shifts in voter sentiment about pandemic management in the past two weeks, but the Victorian government went backwards, with 47% of respondents characterising management of the pandemic as good at the end of January compared with 42% this fortnight. The latest poll indicates Morrison has political vulnerabilities beyond pandemic management. The data indicates 38% of respondents are less likely to vote for the Coalition because of rising cost of living pressure, and 37% say the same about the government’s lack of a credible climate change policy. But the data indicates another issue Morrison has focused on – greater regulation of social media platforms – is salient with voters. Significant majorities agree with the proposition that digital platforms have a duty of care to protect users and people should not be permitted to hide their identities through the use of anonymous accounts. Parliament will open on Tuesday with a statement of acknowledgment. Last year Australia’s sex discrimination commissioner Kate Jenkins in a landmark review of parliament’s toxic workplace culture recommended political leaders make a public statement acknowledging “the impact of the misconduct on individuals and the lack of action taken in the past” and “outline the institutional leadership commitment to change, with shared accountability for progress”. Sorrow will be expressed at the opening of the day’s proceedings as well as the next steps in implementing recommendations from the review. The Jenkins inquiry was triggered after former Liberal staffer Brittany Higgins alleged she was raped after hours in a ministerial office in March 2019. Higgins’s allegations are the subject of separate criminal proceedings. On Wednesday, Higgins will appear at the National Press Club in Canberra with former Australian of the Year and survivor advocate Grace Tame.",News/Australia news,Guardian Essential poll: voter anger cooling at Morrison government handling of pandemic,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/08/guardian-essential-poll-voter-anger-cooling-at-morrison-government-handling-of-pandemic
2/8/2022,"Last week I visited a friend in Sydney and over four days we drove up the coast to Yamba, stopping to eat, sleep and swim along the way. The La Niña weather was warm, overcast and very humid, so nothing dried easily. Not our towels. Not our swimsuits. Not our t-shirts. Anything left on the floor of the car in between towns developed a musty smell. When we got back to his apartment in North Bondi it was the first time I noticed (and was grateful for) his dehumidifier. Unfortunately, humidity poses a threat to our bags, clothes and shoes – here’s how to mitigate it.  If (like me) you’ve forgotten all your primary school science, humidity is the concentration of water vapour in the air. In warm weather when humidity is high the air holds more water vapour, so there’s nowhere for moisture to evaporate to. That’s why we feel sticky and everything takes longer to dry. This can be a problem, since clothes, shoes and bags that are damp for too long can develop mildew, a type of mould that thrives when things are warm and wet. According to Alice Payne, an associate professor of fashion at Queensland University of Technology, the first step to avoiding this is to make sure clothes, shoes and bags are never put away damp or soiled, because mildew feeds on dirt and food stains. Clearing any crumbs from your handbag is also key. As mildew grows, it can also eat plant-based fibres like cotton, linen and viscose, causing permanent discoloration and damage. This creates quite a dilemma: natural fibres are more comfortable to wear in humidity since they are breathable and absorbent, but they are more susceptible to mildew than synthetics. Synthetics are less susceptible to mildew (although they can fall prey to it when left damp or dirty for long periods) but are not comfortable to wear in humid environments. It might be counterintuitive in warm wet weather, but Payne suggests opting for garments made of wool because of the fibre’s antibacterial and moisture wicking properties. Less common fabrics like ramie and hemp are also naturally resistant to rot and mildew. Payne also suggests considering the weave of the fabric because “some weaves perform better in humid conditions”. Seersucker, the crinkly cotton fabric with a complex social history, has a practical reason for being associated with warm, wet climates. “The crinkle allows it to float over the skin more than flat weaves do,” Payne says. Payne says drying clothes flat and un-bunched on the line is the most effective way to ensure everything dries completely. If it is too humid or rainy to dry clothes outside, hang them on a rack inside with space between each garment. Use a fan to help circulate the air, or a dehumidifier to remove excess moisture. After you’ve done a load of washing, ensure as much moisture is removed from the clothes as possible. Either wring out each garment or put them on a high-spin cycle in your washing machine – but be mindful of delicate garments and their care instructions. For shoes and bags, run a towel inside anything leather to remove surface moisture and place it somewhere dry away from heaters and sunlight. Pull out the tongue and insole of canvas shoes and leave them to dry in the sun. Stuffing shoes and bags with tissue paper can also help absorb excess moisture. If mildew has already formed, Payne recommends washing suffering garments on “a hot wash with some bleach”. If your garment is too delicate for this, use a laundry detergent with antimicrobial ingredients like citrus seed extracts or tea tree oil. Dry cleaning should also work. Alternatively, Payne says you can spot treat mildew stains by rubbing lemon juice into them, or sponging them with hydrogen peroxide and drying the garment in the sun. This can also be applied to shoes or bags made of fabric. For leather, take your shoes or bag outside and use a microfibre cloth to remove the mildew – but be sure to protect your airways while you do so. Then, Payne says to apply rubbing alcohol to the affected area to clean it further. Do your best to remove all the spores as anything left behind can continue to grow. There are also specialty leather products like this one that can help remove mould and mildew. When storing things in humid environments be sure to check closets and drawers for mould and treat and remove all spores before placing anything inside. Since air flow between garments can help prevent mildew, don’t over overcrowd your wardrobe, and every so often, on dry sunny days, hang your clothes outside for some air. Never store garments in plastic bags, including dry cleaning bags. For clothes that require garment bags, always opt for cloth bags and place some tissue paper in pockets. Desiccant pouches – the kind you find everything from shoe boxes to tech products to vitamin jars – are also great for slipping into pockets, so don’t throw them away. The same goes for storing shoes, sneakers and handbags, stuff them with tissue paper and a desiccant pouch, place them inside cloth bags and store them in the driest conditions as possible. Clothes, bags and shoes can also be sprayed with moth or water repellents before storage to help prevent mildew too.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Break the mould: how to prevent mildew on clothes and accessories in high humidity,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/08/break-the-mould-how-to-prevent-mildew-on-clothes-and-accessories-in-high-humidity
2/8/2022,"At first glance, Chai Time at Cinnamon Gardens, the latest novel from prolific Australian author Shankari Chandran, may look like a light affair: a tale about a diverse group of elderly Australians living in a family-run nursing home in Sydney. But beyond the twee cover and cozy title, Chandran’s novel has serious heft, spanning several timelines and tackling complex topics like race, trauma and the structural inequality engendered in so-called multicultural Australia.  The titular Cinnamon Gardens is a nursing home in Sydney, which was revamped in the 80s by migrant couple Maya and Zakhir after they fled civil war in their home of Sri Lanka. As Tamils and academics, the couple experienced persecution, torture and intimidation, forcing them to leave. Cinnamon Gardens offers a new beginning and the couple transform it into a sanctuary for culturally diverse seniors. Fast forward several decades to the mid-2000s and Zakhir is missing, presumed dead. Maya is a resident in the nursing home she developed which is now run by her daughter Anjali. Cinnamon Gardens, meanwhile, becomes the site of a culture war when local councillor Gareth – a longtime friend of Anjali – discovers that her parents once toppled a statue of Captain Cook which stood at the nursing home, in an act of anti-colonial rebellion. He accuses Cinnamon Gardens of racism and lodges a complaint with the Human Rights Commission, instigating a nation-wide backlash against “ungrateful” immigrant communities. This sets off a series of escalating events that unmasks the brewing discord in western Sydney’s multicultural community, and triggers the trauma of the residents and staff who have escaped persecution in their home countries. The novel is told through two timelines: the first in the present day, as Maya and Anjali grapple with the accusations brought to them, and the second through flashbacks to the Sri Lankan civil war. As each new piece of the puzzle of the family’s past is uncovered, we get closer to solving the mystery of Zakhir’s disappearance. If it sounds like there’s a lot to keep track of in Chandran’s novel, that’s because there is. There’s family violence; the tragic loss of a child; torture and displacement; a famous author hiding behind a pseudonym; a political battle for local council; extra-marital affairs; and to top it all off, a terrible and unexpected tragedy. The complexity of the narratives are partly to the book’s strength: every character gets a true and nuanced backstory, and Chandran is indisputably talented at creating characters that inspire empathy. But it does feel as though one or two storylines could have been cut; the complexity undermines the suspense of the novel opener and, by the time its mysteries are solved, you may find yourself having lost track of what was happening regardless. And while I love a sprawling, intergenerational epic, the balance doesn’t always sit right in Chai Time; the entire present-day timeline takes place over a short period, in contrast with decades in the flashbacks. Chandran possesses an incredible ability to immerse the reader in historical fact and detail that makes even the most unimaginable scenes in Sri Lanka feel real – but a simpler story may have made for a better book. Chai Time in Cinnamon Gardens is an enticing, if not entirely realised, opportunity for a wider conversation about Australia, the diversity of its people and the gaps in our collective cultural knowledge. This is a book that requires concentration and full immersion – but it will reward the reader for that investment.

2/8/2022,"Australia could resurrect its car industry in an “environmentally and socially transformative” way by drawing on its rich mineral resources to make electric vehicles, according to a new report. The plan for a new electric vehicle manufacturing sector is laid out in a report titled Rebuilding Vehicle Manufacturing in Australia, from the Australia Institute’s Carmichael Centre.  The report says with 34,258 people still working in car manufacturing making components for the global supply chain and sections of old car factories still intact, Australia has a strong base from which to restart the industry. Even if Australia is unable to revive the industry to the point where it can make an electric car from scratch, there would still be much to gain from expanding into a portion of the global automotive supply chain such as batteries, the report says. Australia is already expanding its production of lithium and other critical minerals needed to build batteries and other electronic infrastructure that will underpin the global zero emissions transition. In 2017 the extraction of spodumene – crushed raw lithium – alone was worth $1.1bn, but processing it into precursor materials and then making batteries could create an industry worth $22.1bn. Australia’s domestic car industry shuttered in 2017 due to a high Australian dollar brought by the mining boom, as well as political opposition. Lead author of the report, Dr Mark Dean, said a new EV industry may not be a “panacea” to Australia’s lack of ambition on climate change, but building a new, hi-tech industry would make the transition easier by spreading the benefits. “For decades the auto industry was the glue that held communities together. It provided security and good standards of living,” Dean said. “What you’ll be doing is saying to all these different people in all these different communities that by creating an electric vehicle industry-driven future, you will benefit. “We need people to mine these commodities, process them, and we need them to be transported so they can be manufactured – everyone along the way benefits.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The report recommends a commission be set up with representatives from government, business and unions to map out how a new industry can be created. It also recommends any new industry be powered by renewable energy, clear incentives to encourage take up, including fuel efficiency standards, and efforts made to attract major car companies. AMWU national president, Andrew Dettmer, said making electric cars offered a “once in a generation opportunity” that would create a “virtuous cycle” of growing employment and innovation while lowering emissions. “As far as we’re concerned this is a great opportunity to rebuild from the bottom up a new vehicle industry in Australia,” Dettmer said. “But we need to see government take it up and, for once, be bold.” Dettmer said electric cars had fewer parts than petrol vehicles, but the complexity of guidance systems, suspension systems, batteries and collision avoidance and other systems required much more work. Behyad Jafari from the Electric Vehicle Council said Australia “absolutely has the opportunity to do large-scale industry manufacturing” but warned it wasn’t going to “fall into our laps”. With waiting lists growing and EV sales having tripled over the past two years, the biggest challenge facing the industry was supply. “We sell about 1m vehicles every year and we have 19m cars on the road to work our way through,” Jafari said. “We know that when someone buys a car, that will stay on the road for 15 years. If we plan to reach net zero emissions by next decade we need to be done with petrol and diesel. “Building electric vehicles here means we could ensure we’ll have a supply of electric vehicles available for us to buy, which would be a really big boost to decarbonising our entire market.” Bill Gillespie, president of SEA Electric in the Asia Pacific, an Australian company that makes and converts trucks and buses to electric, said when other governments worldwide were competing to attract new industry Australia lacked clear policy. “If you were in the US you wouldn’t look to Australia and say let’s establish a zero emission truck business, because the ground is not very fertile at the moment,” Gillespie said. “Like the world’s longest road trip, Australia will transition but it will be slow and companies will be left asking, are we there yet?”",News/Environment,Electric cars touted to recharge Australian manufacturing sector,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/08/electric-cars-touted-to-recharge-australian-manufacturing-sector
