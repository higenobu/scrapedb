4/7/2022,"Morning everyone. I’m Martin Farrer and these are the stories you need to know about today. Rishi Sunak’s multimillionaire wife claims non-domicile status, it has emerged, which allows her to save millions of pounds in tax on dividends collected from her family’s IT business empire. Akshata Murthy, who receives about £11.5m in annual dividends from her stake in the Indian IT services company Infosys, declares non-dom status, a scheme that allows people to avoid tax on foreign earnings. Murthy, the daughter of Infosys’s billionaire founder, owns a 0.93% stake in the tech firm worth approximately £690m. Tulip Siddiq, the shadow economic secretary to the treasury, said Sunak should explain how much tax his family saved while “he was putting taxes up for millions of working families”. The non-domicile status is legal and can be used to avoid paying UK tax on income from overseas rents and bank interest as well as foreign dividends. The Treasury declined to comment. A spokesperson for Murthy said India did not allow dual citizenship, “so, according to British law, Ms Murthy is treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes. She has always and will continue to pay UK taxes on all her UK income.” More than one in 10 residents of some of London’s wealthiest neighbourhoods have claimed “non-dom” status at some point, meaning they paid no tax on their offshore income. The number of people who had ever claimed non-dom status in the UK rose from 162,000 in 2001 to 238,000 in 2018. And a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies says the top 0.1% of earners in the UK have annual incomes in excess of £500,000, showing the effect of “unfair” tax rates available to business owners. More than 50,000 people in the top income bracket account for 6% of all earnings. Ukraine latest – Volodymyr Zelenskiy says new sanctions by the west against Russia do not go far enough and will be seen by invading forces as a “permission to attack”, as fears of an assault on the east of the country intensify and civilians still there were urged to leave “while the opportunity still exists”. The deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said the authorities would “not be able to help” residents who stayed behind once large-scale fighting erupted. Our reporter in Kyiv tells the heart-wrenching story of a grandfather who fears that his granddaughter – orphaned by the fighting in Mariupol – might be taken to live in Russia. A Russian teacher could be jailed after pupils recorded her making anti-war comments in class and put them online where they were discovered by the police. Here’s what we know so far on day 43 of the invasion, and you can follow all the latest developments at our live blog. Going nuclear – Boris Johnson will launch Britain’s new energy strategy today with nuclear power at the heart of the long-term plan, but ministers have refused to set targets for onshore wind and vowed to continue the exploitation of North Sea oil and gas. The strategy will enrage environmentalists, who say the government’s plans are in defiance of its own net zero targets and neglect alternative measures that experts say would provide much quicker relief from high energy bills. The main points include increasing nuclear capacity from 7 gigawatts to 24GW, raising the offshore wind target to 50GW (from 11GW today), solar growing five times from 14GW to 70GW by 2035, and an “impartial” review into whether fracking is safe. Cancer concern – More patients are diagnosed with cancer in A&E in Britain than in other comparable high-income countries. A major study in the Lancet Oncology journal found more than a third of patients in England, Scotland and Wales discover they have the disease only once they are in hospital. People who end up in A&E, sometimes after multiple trips to their GP, are less likely to survive the disease, particularly if they have stomach, bowel, liver, pancreatic, lung or ovarian cancer. Conversion row – About 50 Tory MPs could force the government to toughen up its ban on conversion practices by backing a move to extend the protections to transgender people. Campaigners fighting to outlaw the controversial exercise said “the battle is definitely still on” and remained confident that No 10 would either be swayed or defeated in the remaining months. The PM said yesterday that he does not “think that biological males should be competing in female sporting events”. The Swift imperium – Latin teachers are being encouraged to use Taylor Swift’s lyrics, Disney songs, Minecraft and fan fiction to help make the ancient language of Virgil and Cicero more accessible. A Cambridge academic has produced a new guide that suggests Latin should be taught more like a modern foreign language, where students are encouraged to speak, sing, perform or write creatively. Among their successes was Taylor Swift’s hit Bad Blood, the chorus to which was translated as Quod, care, nunc malum sanguinem habemus, and Let It Go (Libera) from Frozen. The first round of the French election takes place this Sunday with Emmanuel Macron staking his claim to a second term. But to do so he must beat a resurgent far right, says our Paris correspondent Angelique Chrisafis.

But an often painful redevelopment is giving it a new lease of life, writes Oliver Wainwright. A downcast Thomas Tuchel declared Chelsea’s position in the Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid to be irretrievable after their 3-1 first-leg defeat at Stamford Bridge and described his team’s slump in form as “alarming”. It was a triumph for Madrid’s continuity, however, thanks to 34-year-old Karim Benzema’s hat-trick. In last night’s other quarter-final, Villareal beat Bayern Munich 1-0. Everton’s relegation woes worsened with a 3-2 defeat Burnley, who are now just one point afrift of the Merseysiders. Eric ten Hag is confident of becoming Manchester United’s next manager after talks with the club. Anticipation is mounting in Augusta about Tiger Woods’ return to the Masters later today, and it’s also the return today of cricket’s County Championship. And rugby lost one of its greats yesterday with the passing of Scotland and Lions prop Tom Smith from cancer at the age of 50. Swedish retailers Ikea and H&M are teaming up to create an “ideas factory” on the high street that aims to seek out, mentor and promote designers and small-scale manufacturers. Atelier 100 will open in London in May and is launching an open call today for creatives and producers based within 100km of the store to help stock its shelves. The FTSE100 is going to take a hit of around 0.25% this morning. The pound is on $1.307 and €1.198. The Mirror leads with “Sunak wife tax fury”, and “Sunak’s wife ‘avoided tax’ as non-dom” is the splash in the i. The Guardian has that story on the front but leads with “PM’s push for nuclear power splits Tories and angers green groups”, while the Times also has a picture of the chancellor and his wife but leads with “UK to send armoured vehicles to aid Ukraine”. The Telegraph has a powerful dispatch from Ukraine and the headline “‘What is this pit?’ I asked. They said: ‘This is a graveyard for you’”, while the FT goes with “Western allies impose harshest sanctions yet on Russian banks”. The Express leads with “Thank you PM! Sports stars back Boris in trans row”, and the Mail also leads with that controversy and the headline “Finally, a voice of common sense”.

4/7/2022,"More patients are diagnosed with cancer in A&E in Britain than in other comparable high-income countries, according to the first major study of its kind. More than a third of patients in England, Scotland and Wales only find out they have the disease once they are in hospital, the research published in the Lancet Oncology journal suggests. People who end up in A&E, sometimes after multiple trips to their GP, are less likely to survive the disease, particularly if they have stomach, bowel, liver, pancreatic, lung or ovarian cancer. The International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership and Cancer Research UK (CRUK) examined cancer data and linked hospital admissions across 14 regions in six countries: Australia, Canada, Denmark, New Zealand, Norway and the UK. Cancer data often has a time lag – the data was collected between 2012 and 2017 – but CRUK said it feared the outlook is now even worse after the Covid-19 pandemic. Experts at University College London looked at eight major cancers and found that more than a third of patients in England (37%), Wales (37%) and Scotland (39%) were diagnosed after being rushed to hospital. In Northern Ireland, which was measured using a different definition, emergency presentations accounted for more than a quarter (28%) of diagnoses. England, Wales and Scotland ranked worse than all other regions and countries in the study except New Zealand, where the rate was 43%. The lowest rate recorded was 24% in Victoria, Australia. “For months, we have been warning that cancer survival could go backwards due to the pandemic,” said Michelle Mitchell, CRUK’s chief executive. “The UK is already lagging when it comes to cancer survival – this study helps us understand why, showing that countries with higher levels of emergency presentations have lower survival.” She added: “If we want to build a world-class cancer service, we need to learn from comparable countries and ensure fewer patients are being diagnosed with cancer after an emergency referral or trip to A&E. We’d like to see governments across the UK take bold action on this within their cancer plans so that by 2032, fewer than 10% of cancer cases are diagnosed through emergency routes.” When it comes to specific cancers, 46% of people with pancreatic cancer were diagnosed in an emergency overall, but the figure was much higher in Britain, at 56% in England and Wales and 59% in Scotland. In New Zealand, 60% of patients were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in an emergency and in Norway it was 55%. However, the figures for Ontario and Alberta, both in Canada, were 35% and 41% respectively. A total of 34% of people in England and Wales and 35% in Scotland were diagnosed with bowel cancer in an emergency, but the figure was 27% in Ontario and 32% in New South Wales in Australia. Meanwhile, 47% of people in the UK were diagnosed with liver cancer in an emergency, compared with 40% in New South Wales, 32% in Alberta and 28% in Ontario. In Norway the figure was 51%. The study found that those aged 75 and over were more likely to be diagnosed in an emergency, as were those whose cancer was advanced. Emergency diagnoses also resulted in a twofold higher risk of dying in the next 12 months compared with people who were diagnosed at other times. Cancers that often had non-specific, vague symptoms, such as pancreatic, liver, lung and ovarian cancer, were also more likely to be diagnosed in A&E.",News/Society,More than a third of British cancer patients are diagnosed in A&E,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/07/more-than-third-uk-cancer-patients-diagnosed-in-emergency
4/7/2022,"Young adults and teenagers who went to state schools in England are as happy with their lives as their peers at private schools, according to a new study by researchers at University College London. The research found few differences in mental health or life satisfaction between the two groups, which surprised the study’s authors because of the substantial advantages in spending on wellbeing and support enjoyed by those at private schools. Dr Morag Henderson, of UCL’s social research institute, the paper’s lead author, said: “Although school resource is greater in private schools, the academic stress students face might be too and so we see each force cancelling the other out.” The study – published in the Cambridge Journal of Education on Thursday – is based on responses from a national sample of more than 15,000 people born in 1989 to 1990 who attended school in England, and were surveyed as teenagers and later in their 20s. “While these methods do not prove causality, the absence of significant positive effects implies that there is no evidence that parents who decided to pay for private schooling were gaining mental health and life satisfaction advantages for their children,” the authors stated. The research measured participants’ mental health by asking questions such as: “Have you been able to concentrate on what you are doing?” and “Have you lost sleep over worry?” It found little difference in responses between the two groups before and after adjusting for factors such as social background and educational achievement. Those who attended fee-paying independent schools did report higher levels of life satisfaction in their 20s. But after responses were adjusted to exclude the effects of advantages such as higher income, house ownership and better exam results, the researchers again found no substantial differences in satisfaction levels. Girls at private schools did report better states of mental health at the age of 16 than their peers at state schools but the same gap did not appear at the age of 14 or 15. The study concluded that “there is no additional advantage of private schooling with respect to mental health and life satisfaction” for the cohort it studied. But it cautioned that private schools have further increased their spending on wellbeing and pastoral support in the years since the sample group attended school. Dr Henderson said it was possible that the increased pastoral support “was just starting to make a difference” for private school pupils, who she thought might have received more support during the Covid lockdowns. “This is speculation but it might be that we see state school students fare worse in terms of mental health compared to private school students, post-lockdown. This question is ripe for future analyses,” Dr Henderson said. Earlier research among those born in 1970 found that attending a UK private school was associated with “heightened psychological distress” among women. But since the 1980s private schools have greatly increased their spending on supporting pupils.",News/Education,England state school pupils as happy with life as private school peers – survey,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/07/england-state-school-pupils-as-happy-with-life-as-private-school-peers-survey
4/7/2022,"Britain, Canada and Australia have all so far declined to expel Russian diplomats, putting themselves at odds with 15 EU nations that have now evicted more than 200 in response to the pictures of war crimes committed in Ukraine. A further 100 Russian diplomats had been expelled in the preceding two months. The British reticence to act came despite an effective warning from the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, that the west’s relations with Vladimir Putin’s Russia were over. Truss told a Nato foreign ministers’ dinner that the Nato-Russian Founding Act, the basis of cooperation between Moscow and Nato, was at an end. She said: “The age of engagement is over. We need a new approach to security in Europe based on resilience, defence and deterrence. “There is no time for false comfort. Russia is not retreating but regrouping and repositioning to push harder for the east and south of Ukraine.” Truss added that this would require a new approach to those countries that might be at risk of being ensnared in Russia’s web – Moldova, Georgia, Finland and Sweden. That may require expending more diplomatic resources to monitor and analyse Russia, and some diplomats claim expulsions of Russian diplomats from the UK will only lead to tit-for-tat expulsions from an already denuded Moscow embassy. In 2018 Britain expelled 23 Russian diplomats after Moscow refused to explain how a Russian-made nerve agent was used on Sergei Skripal, a former spy, in Salisbury. Russia responded to the UK’s actions by saying the British and Russian embassies must be of equal size, requiring more than 50 British diplomats to leave. The UK does not disclose the size of its embassy in Russia, but it is known the previous expulsions stripped the UK of much political intelligence and research expertise. Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, became the western leader who was most willing to articulate the case for continued diplomatic relations, saying that if Canada expelled Russians, Moscow was bound to implement reciprocal measures – thus reducing the number of Canadian eyes and ears in Russia. “I am just not sure the symbolic gesture of excluding Russian diplomats from what they are doing in Canada is worth the cost of losing our diplomats in Moscow,” he said. In the last seven days Poland has expelled 45 Russian diplomats, Germany 40, France 35, Slovenia 33, Italy 30, Spain 25, Belgium 21, the Netherlands 17, Denmark 15, Latvia 13, Greece 12, Portugal 10, Estonia seven, Ireland four, Sweden three, the Czech Republic one and Luxembourg one. Lithuania said it was expelling the Russian ambassador. The expulsions have come in two waves, some in mid-March, but a large crop after pictures of alleged Russian war crimes circulated. A continued refusal of the UK to join its European allies has already drawn criticism from the Labour party, given how much store the UK placed in the act of solidarity by other western embassies in the wake of the Skripal poisoning. Those expulsions were backed by Donald Trump, who threw out 60 Russian diplomats. In total 29 western countries expelled 145 Russian diplomats. The Russian deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko, said he wanted to maintain diplomatic relations with the west, but pledged countermeasures.Grushko said European countries disrupting the work of Russian diplomats were damaging their own interests.",News/Politics,"Britain, Canada and Australia decline so far to expel Russian diplomats",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/07/britain-canada-and-australia-decline-so-far-to-expel-russian-diplomats
4/7/2022,"Egypt, Africa’s most north-easterly country, is one of the hottest, driest and sunniest on Earth – its desert climate inhabitable only because of the Nile River, which brings water and allows irrigation for farming. However, Egypt’s size means there is a big contrast between the climates of the far north and far south. This is epitomised by the two cities at either end of the country: Alexandria, on the Mediterranean coast, and Aswan, at the head of Lake Nasser, towards Sudan. Alexandria has a typically pleasant Mediterranean climate, with hot, dry summers and warm winters, during which rain occasionally falls. Even so, the total annual rainfall for the city is only 235mm (less than 10 inc), which is still within the definition of “desert”. In summer, the hot wind known as the khamsin blows northwards from the country’s interior, often bringing dust and sand. Aswan, more than 620 miles (1,000km) to the south, gets a maximum of 10mm (less than half an inch) of rain a year; and sometimes none at all. Temperatures here are hot in winter, though at nights they fall into the low teens; and very hot – sometimes dangerously so – in summer, when mid-40C spells are not uncommon. The capital, Cairo, and the tourist sites at Luxor, are best visited from November to March, when the weather is usually dry, sunny and warm.

4/7/2022,"Swedish retailers Ikea and H&M are teaming up to create an “ideas factory” on the high street that aims to seek out, mentor and promote designers and small-scale manufacturers in London. Atelier 100, the first joint retail venture between the world’s largest furniture retailer and one of the largest global fashion chains will open in Hammersmith, west London, in May and is launching an open call on Thursday for creatives and producers based within 100km of the store to help stock its shelves. The store is in Ikea’s first UK shopping centre, Livat, which opened in February, and is intended to be a meeting place and workplace for designers and makers, helping to foster new alliances and ideas, and be an outlet for selling their creations. Successful applicants will receive up to £10,000 to help scale up their ideas into commercially viable products, and training and mentoring from Ikea and H&M insiders as well as other experts. All kinds of projects will be considered, from beauty and fashion to jewellery, art and even music. The only limitation is that any end product must be small enough for shoppers to carry away from the Hammersmith store. The look and feel of the store is also likely to change to reflect the interests and ideas developed by those involved. “We want to be open to ideas,” said Camilla Henriksson, the global brand innovation manager for H&M. She said the two retailers wanted to “come closer to the customers” and to local people with ideas to ensure they continued to provide what people want. Marcus Engman, the chief creative officer at Ikea’s parent Ingka Group, said the Hammersmith outlet was a year-long pilot project. If it works, further venues will be developed in other cities around the world in future. He said that the idea for Atelier100 had been under discussion for some time but was part of the search for new ideas to recreate high streets that have been hit by the pandemic and the shift to online shopping. “You can either see it as a challenging time for retail or that there has never been more opportunity for developing the future ways of retailing than right now. We try to have a positive outlook and see things will get better,” Engman said. The first 20 applicants for Atelier100, who have until 18 April to put themselves forward, will be able to begin selling their existing products in Hammersmith from next month. It is hoped that new items developed with help from the project will go on sale from October. Atelier100 has already linked up with the creative community around London by cataloguing more than 200 businesses that are designing and manufacturing products such as fashion and furnishings and the materials used to create them. The project is now attempting to spread the net wider with posters in London neighbourhoods as well as a digital campaign. “Instead of taking known routes we wanted to explore new ways to find creatives, new materials and small-scale producers existing here in London,” said Henriksson. “We see this as the start of a very exciting adventure. London is bursting with brilliant ideas and creative people, we want to meet these creators where they are. “Opportunities in arts, entertainment and recreation have been the hardest hit by the pandemic. H&M and Ingka Group see this as an opportunity to engage directly with creatives and makers, to give them the visibility that they deserve and to support them in taking their business to the next level.”",News/Business,Ikea and H&M launch ‘ideas factory’ for local designers and creatives in London,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/07/ikea-and-hm-launch-ideas-factory-for-local-designers-and-creatives-in-london
4/7/2022,"The last programme presented by married couple Nick and Vanessa Lachey (fixtures in the reality TV firmament for the last 10-15 years, for reasons that need not concern us now, or possibly ever) was Love Is Blind. This was (indeed continues to be, until at least 2024, as a fourth and fifth seasons have just been commissioned) a show in which strangers communicate from single “pods” without being able to see each other until various pairs profess themselves in love, become engaged, then meet and get to know one another for a month before actually-factually getting married. I remember the inaugural season vividly. I described it as “absurd, revolting, endearing, toxic and wholesome by turns – and addictive as hell throughout … Crack-meth.” I also wondered whether it would be possible to exploit emotional frailties, profane the scared, make the private and precious public and worthless and turn it into voyeuristic ratings bait any more ruthlessly or efficiently. Well, bless my little rhetorical socks – we now have an answer! The answer is “Yes, absolutely”, and it is delivered in the form of The Ultimatum: Marry or Move On. In this 10-part bin fire, the Lacheys introduce us to what is claimed to be six couples, but by my instantly anxious and fevered count, number at least 302, who have in common the fact that one of each pair wants the other to put a ring on it or else call a halt to their relationship. Shit or Get Off the Pot would have been a better title, but, alas, the US still clings in the strangest ways to its Puritan past, so to marry or move on is the decorous choice presented. I cannot possibly be expected to remember 604 – or indeed 12 – contestant names at my time of life, especially when they are all entirely interchangeable, so, instead, I have labelled them blonks 1-6A/B (the men) and blermps 1-6A/B (the women. Homosexuality has not yet entered the Lacheyean universe, although they have promised a second season with an LGBT cast). “A” denotes blondness, “B” denotes not-blondness and that is literally everything covered that matters in this show. To be fair, a couple of the blonks do stand out (Jake for being nine parts puppy and apparently as nice a guy as reality TV has ever unearthed; Colby for being the only male ultimatum-giver and for having Garth Brooks vibes even before he puts on a Stetson in the final episode). One or two of the blermps are also notable: Alexis is a flint-eyed, lantern-jawed blond who wants a ring in return for the cooking, cleaning and laundry she does for her live-in blonk (“Marriage is a financial and emotional transaction”), and April is a quick, funny, genuine charmer of 23 who should no more be wanting to get married than … any quick, funny, charming 23-year-old should. Anyway. The couples are split up and encouraged to lounge round a pool, have dinner, drink cocktails and see if they “spark” with anyone else. Then they choose a new partner to live with for three weeks before returning to their beloved, and deciding whether to shit or – I mean, marry or move on. This all goes exactly as well, which is to say as badly, as you would expect. Soon, contestants are sobbing, viewers are hoarse from screaming at the screen (the utter fury on Alexis’ face when she chisels out of Colby – during their second drink – that he doesn’t see himself marrying her lives with me still), and the Lachey/Netflix accountants are cracking open the champagne in their toxic lairs. The crack-meth blend is as potent as ever. Within 15 minutes, the lizard part of your brain is hopelessly invested and the higher functions can only pray for the accelerated heat death of the universe before the remaining nine and three quarter hours are up. It’s absolutely terrible. Morally, obviously, there is literally no justification for deliberately putting temptation in people’s way (I believe it is one of the tenets in fact of quite a few world religions). Creatively, it’s bankrupt. Educationally, intellectually it’s … not. Every other word out of every other mouth suggests we should build a pyre and place feminism atop it, for the battle is surely lost. But, oh, the entertainment. Oh, the escapism. Oh, the glory of letting hate for this and that blonk, and love for blermp 2A, who looks to be moving towards her rightful place on the arm of new blonk 6B flow untrammelled through you, washing the mental detritus of the day away and leaving you cleansed, empty and ready for the next day’s accrual of cares and woes.

4/7/2022,"‘Ilove Park Hill because you always know when you’re home,” says Joanne Marsden. “When I come back on the train, I look up and think: ‘Wow, I’m here. I’ve made it.’” She’s talking about the colossal housing estate that stands on the hillside above Sheffield like a great concrete castle, where she was born in 1965 in her nan’s back bedroom. Her grandparents were among the first residents to move into the bold vision of 1,000 council flats when it opened in 1961, her grandad taking a job in the boiler house that heated the homes. Marsden got her own flat a few doors down when she had her first child, then moved out in the 90s when the family grew. But, after some time in London, she moved back here in 2015, into one of the newly refurbished flats in the first phase of the estate’s redevelopment. “They modernised it and put bling on it,” she says, “but I can’t say it feels any better than what it were. It always felt good living here.” Eighteen years after Sheffield city council sold the entire estate to the developer Urban Splash for £1, with the hope of seeing it refurbished in a few years, the project is about two-thirds of the way through. Almost scuppered by the 2008 financial crisis, and beset by funding problems ever since, the first phase opened in 2013; the second phase is nearly finished. It marks the completion of 450 flats, of which 20% are classed as affordable, as well as 356 student bedrooms in a third phase, which opened last year. The current state of the place – still completely derelict at one end, spruced up at the other – reads as a surreal diagram of how attitudes to postwar architecture have shifted over the years, and how an estate can be scrubbed up for sale in different ways. Designed by the architects Jack Lynn and Ivor Smith when they were in their 20s, working at Sheffield council’s architects department, Park Hill was the jewel in the crown of the Labour authority’s housebuilding boom, a dazzling essay in “the new brutalism”. It was built on the site of a cleared slum, but rather than rehousing the residents in towers, the architects attempted to replicate the tightly packed grid of the area, with elevated streets stacked to form blocks that snaked down the hillside. “It was amazing for playing out,” says Marsden. “We’d go up in the lift with our bikes, ride all the way along the street, then cycle down the hill through the middle of the estate, right back to the bottom. No matter what the weather was, you could always play out because of the covered streets.” As well as providing a fun vertical playground, the “streets in the sky” were an ingenious way of dealing with the sloping site, so you could access any floor of the building from ground level at different points on the hillside (sadly no longer the case, with access confined to a central entrance). It might look like an intransigent megastructure, but the blocks have totally different characters, as the frame adapts to the context like a concrete chameleon. At the top of the hill, it’s the scale of low-rise terrace housing, while by the time it reaches the bottom it becomes a 14-storey cliff face, the roofline remaining a constant height throughout. With a butcher and baker, doctor and dentist, as well as community centre, creche, primary school and four pubs, it was conceived as a self-sufficient hillside hamlet. “We had it all,” says Marsden. “You didn’t have to go into town for anything.” It became famous throughout the world: a 1962 book, Ten Years of Housing in Sheffield, documenting the council’s programme, was published in English, French and Russian. The story of what happened next is well told, if not always accurately. The collapse of the Sheffield steel industry in the 1980s, aided by Margaret Thatcher’s onslaught, saw mass unemployment, with many dumped in Park Hill with no choice in the matter. What had been a source of intense municipal pride became branded a sink estate, the elevated streets synonymous with muggings, drug addicts and an easy getaway for burglars. People saw it as a no-go area, a place of no hope. But that’s not how Marsden remembers it. “It wasn’t a no-go area at all,” she says. “That was just what people who had never been here said. You talked to anybody who lived here and they didn’t fear nowt. You could walk through the landings at any time of day and it was fine.” The dodgy reputation, she thinks, “was engineered to get us out of there so they could redevelop it. It was a time when people wanted access to inner-city living and they realised how valuable the site was.” Had it not been listed by English Heritage in 1998, Park Hill would almost certainly have been demolished. A second similar estate nearby, Hyde Park, was partly flattened in the 90s, its remnants horribly clad like a fridge, while a third scheme, Kelvin Flats, was erased completely. “We were the only ones stupid enough to take it on,” says Tom Bloxham, the founder of Urban Splash. He is sitting in the vegan cafe that now occupies one of Park Hill’s ground floor commercial units, dressed in a black Prada x Adidas tracksuit, with a matching hat. “When I first looked at the place online, I thought: ‘Fucking hell, that looks like a disaster,’” he recalls. “From the outside, it looked really crap. But as you get inside it, you see there is this object of beauty.” He was wooed by what residents had enjoyed for decades: the fact that every flat is double aspect; each has its own balcony and views on to green space; every one faces south. “And it has better space standards than modern so-called ‘luxury’ flats,” he adds, exceeding the now defunct Parker Morris minimum space standards even before they were adopted in the 60s. But fixing it up hasn’t been straightforward. The project had to be rescued from the jaws of the 2008 financial crisis with a £39m injection of public funding, which saw the first phase completed in 2013. Then Urban Splash had to be bailed out by the regeneration giant Places for People, with which it formed a joint venture to complete the second phase, while the student housing provider Alumno took over the third. The fourth phase, which includes a big arts centre at ground level, has planning permission, but funding remains up in the air. The first block received a mixed reception: it was nominated for the Stirling prize, but purists were aghast. Following Historic England’s “squint test” principle (that it should still be recognisable as Park Hill from a distance), everything was ripped out except the concrete frame. The rhythm of the facade was inverted, so that what once had been window became wall, and vice versa, while the subtly toned brickwork was exchanged for shimmering aluminium cladding panels in eye-searing tones of bright yellow, red and orange. The work of architects Egret West and Hawkins\Brown, it screams “Regeneration!” from every angle, a tutti-frutti billboard trumpeting the public-private asset transfer from the hilltop with garish glee. “We had to do something radical,” says Bloxham. “The perception of the place was so bad back then, we had to make a big statement. It did the job it was supposed to do – it got people talking.” Almost a decade later, the second phase of work at Park Hill – joined to the first by a trio of bridges – couldn’t be more different. From a distance, it looks almost exactly as the day the building first opened. “It’s more like how you’d treat a listed Victorian house,” says Bloxham. “More subtle and sensitive.” The brickwork has been cleaned, revealing that subtly coloured gradient from terracotta at the base, through ochre, to pale mustardy yellow bricks at the top floor, each level matched with coloured mortar. The window openings are where they were originally, only bigger and more thermally efficient. Step inside and the elevated streets feel as they once did, except the tarmac floor has been exchanged for a rubberised version, with geometric patterns cast in front of each front door, inspired by the 1970s lino doormats that residents laid outside their flats. A huge amount of work has been done to improve thermal performance, including insulating the exposed concrete beams inside the flats, after thermal imaging of the first phase revealed how much heat was being lost through the concrete frame – which can’t be clad externally, due to the listed status. “We wanted to keep as much of the building as we possibly could,” says Annalie Riches, of Mikhail Riches architects, the firm that won the 2019 Stirling prize for its pioneering low-energy social housing in Norwich. “I loved the brick from the beginning – it kind of humanises the structure, as something that’s been laid by hand. And it was in really good nick, with not a single crack.” It was a battle to convince both the developer’s project manager (“Who would want to move into the old brick one when you’ve got the shiny one next door?”) and Historic England, which wanted the estate to read as a whole. But thankfully the architects persisted. Their argument for a light-touch approach was aided by the words of Grenville Squires, who was caretaker at Park Hill for 28 years. “I think of her as an elderly lady who’s fallen on hard times,” he said of the building, when refurbishment first began. “She just wants to wash her face and put on a new frock.” While the first phase went all out with the neon makeup, Mikhail Riches has given the grande dame a more dignified makeover, with some subtle flourishes of their own. On their site visits, the architects noticed how residents used to personalise their flats by painting the brick walls outside their balconies – highlighting the individual lives within the bigger uniform grid. At the same time, they realised they would need to insulate these exposed brick walls. One observation informed the other, leading to a solution of coloured render, in 13 shades of lilac, blue and green, lining the flanks of the recessed balconies. The result is a subtle optical trick, recalling the colouring of Le Corbusier’s Unité d’Habitation: from straight on, it looks like Park Hill always has, but, from the sides, you can make out the individual homes. Juggling the internal plans, meanwhile, turned out to be a fiendishly complex jigsaw puzzle, given that no two units are the same. “We thought we had four flat types to work with,” says Riches. “But it turned out to be 37.” Ivor Smith, one of Park Hill’s original architects, had always regretted not designing windows facing on to the raised streets, as the lack of overlooking was blamed for antisocial behaviour, but the load-bearing structure makes it impossible to cut new openings. Instead, the architects have cleverly inserted a thin vertical window next to each front door, complete with little shelves on which the new residents have already started displaying their possessions. A neat row of pot plants in the window greets visitors to the home of Craig De Gouveia, a South African software engineer, who moved into one of the new flats in January. “I’m into brutalism, and I was attracted by the ethos of the original development,” he says. “The ceilings are quite low by modern standards, but you get so much natural light up here, as well as amazing views across the city.” How does he feel about buying a flat that was built as council housing? “There’s obviously a sense of guilt that comes with it, and the conflicts of any area being regenerated,” he says. “But otherwise it would probably be derelict or knocked down. At least it’s preserved something meaningful.” Urban Splash insists that every former council tenant was offered the right to return to Park Hill, but, given that they had been rehoused elsewhere for a decade, few took up the offer. Rules in the tenancy agreement forbidding the homes’ newly raw concrete walls to be painted also put some tenants off, banned from recreating their cosy nests of magnolia and Anaglypta. “I don’t buy this nostalgic thing of the good old days when it was all social housing,” says Bloxham. “To make a place work you need to bring multi-tenure, you need to bring mixed uses, you need to bring change.” At the top of the hill stands the future final phase, the last block to be “decanted” of its tenants a few years ago, which is still technically in council ownership. It is encircled with a construction hoarding, emblazoned with the words: “We were never derelict”, from a poem by Sheffield’s young poet laureate, Otis Mensah, ironically commissioned to celebrate the regeneration. “Just displaced and out of sight,” it continues. “Carrying home inside us / When home they tried to break.” It’s a damning assessment of the council’s neglect of this public asset, but one that should be a call to arms. With more than 20,000 people on the city’s council housing register, Sheffield could take this final flank of homes on for itself and restore them to their original status – a monument to what the welfare state can do, and a beacon of municipal pride.",Arts/Art and design,‘It always felt good here’: how Sheffield’s brutalist Park Hill estate survived the haters and their bulldozers,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/07/park-hill-from-brutalist-glory-to-sink-estate-to-contentious-regeneration
4/7/2022,"When Boris Johnson meets the Polish president and the new German chancellor, he will see the divisions within the EU over Ukraine first-hand, and more broadly how they reflect a contest over the bloc’s future economic model. The British prime minister may find himself in contrasting roles, instinctively sympathising with Andrzej Duda’s position when they meet on Thursday, but gently restraining its rhetoric, while coaxing the naturally circumspect Olaf Scholz to be bolder, and less reactive. Poland is at the extreme end of how to prosecute Vladimir Putin for the war, while Scholz reluctantly finds himself at the other. Poland is happy to tell Germany not just that it has misjudged Putin, but that its misreading reflects a deeper arrogance in Germany. Annalena Baerbock’s inaugural visit to Poland as German foreign minister in December, her third stop after Paris and Brussels, seems a long-forgotten gesture of reconciliation. Riding high on the international admiration it has garnered for opening its arms to 2.5 million Ukrainian refugees, few of Poland’s leaders make much efforts to disguise their frustration with Scholz. Speaking to the German press at the weekend as the news of war crimes started to filter out of Ukraine, the Polish deputy prime minister, Jaroslav Kaczynski – who leads the ruling national-conservative Law and Justice Party, accused Germany and France of “a strong inclination towards Moscow”. For years, Berlin did not want to see what Russia was doing under Putin. “It ended badly, as we can see now,” said Kaczynski. “But it wasn’t difficult to foresee that this would happen. But Germany always thought it knew better.” The Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki – who saw the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, in Warsaw this week – has described Russia as a “totalitarian fascist state” who committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine. He then referred to Angela Merkel, saying: “Frau Chancellor, you have been silent since the beginning of the war. Germany’s policy over the past 10 or 15 years has meant that Russia now has a strength based on the monopoly on the sale of raw materials.” Germany was the main obstacle to stricter sanctions, Morawiecki told journalists. This can be seen from the minutes of EU meetings. “Anyone who reads the transcripts will know that Germany is the biggest brake when it comes to more decisive sanctions.” Some of this Polish nationalist rhetoric about Germany has, of course, existed for decades with extreme denunciations of Berlin for using the EU to create a Fourth German Reich, and impose its own rule of law on Poland. But Poland, with the UK demurely observing, has spent the past month needling Germany about its cautious approach to sanctions and to arming Ukraine. Kaczynski said: “You can’t constantly support a major power like Russia with billions in payments from the purchase of energy. This is inadmissible from a political and moral point of view. This has to come to an end, and Germany should finally take a clear stance on it.” The critical issue, he said, is whether Germany will agree to specific dates by which it will end the import of Russian coal, oil and gas. It is the oil exports, not the gas, that is the money spinner for Russia. Britain agrees, even if it says it less bluntly. Britain also sympathises with Polish plans to step up the rearmament of Ukraine in advance of the battle for Donetsk and Lubansk. Poland says it is willing to hand over its spare Soviet era T-72 tanks. It has as many as 300, 100 of which are modernised and ready to go. Some of Poland’s other ideas, such as peacekeeping mission inside Ukraine and the placing of US nuclear weapons on Polish soil, will probably make the UK Foreign Office blanch. But judging by remarks made by Truss at a Nato foreign ministers’ dinner, the UK and Poland share broadly the same analysis of the threat posed by Putin. She argued: “The age of engagement with Russia is over. The Nato-Russia Founding Act is dead, and it is time to cast off an outdated approach to handling Russia.” These remarks could well be directed at Scholz, who on Friday will be Johnson’s second European visitor this week. In reality British diplomats recognise Germany is going through a painful domestic reassessment of the foreign policy it conducted since the 80s, and whatever Britain’s frustrations with the slowness of that reassessment, it is not going to help that process if London goads or gloats. It would be foolish to belittle the significance of Germany’s decision to spend €100bn on defence. In his remarks on Wednesday, Scholz, within his rhetorical confines, could not have been clearer in denouncing Russian war crimes. Yet one G7 diplomat says: “Whether it is arms exports or sanctions, the Germans are still coming to terms with Russia’s behaviour. They start with why something is not possible, but get to the right position in the end, but it is always two weeks later than necessary.” In Germany’s defence, Robert Habeck, the green economics minister, is working on diversifying Germany’s energy sources, but it is a slow process. The Polish concern is that sometimes the slow pace seems to be driven by German industrialist’s fear that the whole economic model, built on cheap Russian energy, the basis of postwar prosperity, is now permanently threatened. Casting Johnson in the role of a diplomatic bridge builder seems implausible, but if he can persuade Poland and Germany to act more in concert that would be an achievement.",News/World news,EU divisions over Ukraine to be laid bare in No 10 meeting,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/07/eu-divisions-over-ukraine-to-be-laid-bare-in-no-10-meeting
4/7/2022,"Latin teachers are being encouraged to use Taylor Swift’s lyrics, Disney songs, Minecraft and fan fiction to help make the ancient language of Virgil and Cicero more accessible to their 21st-century students. In recent decades, schoolchildren – mainly in private schools – have mastered the early stages of Latin through the tales of Lucius Caecilius, a Pompeii banker who lived in the first century AD, and his family, as described in the popular Cambridge Latin Course, soon to be published in its fifth edition. Now, however, a Cambridge University academic has produced a new guide that suggests Latin should be taught more like a modern foreign language, where students are encouraged to speak, sing, perform or write creatively, rather than just learning vocabulary and grammar from a primer. Translating hit songs into Latin, meanwhile, can enhance students’ grasp of the different techniques used in Roman poetry. Steven Hunt, who has been teaching Latin for 35 years and now trains Latin teachers, says traditional teaching methods still have their place, but is advocating a more imaginative, open-minded approach to widen the subject’s appeal. Currently fewer than 10,000 students sit GCSE Latin and they are overwhelmingly in private schools. According to a recent British Council survey, Latin is only taught at key stage 3 – the first three years of secondary level education – in 2.7% of state schools compared with 49% of independent schools. As well as making the case for “active” Latin in the classroom to engage learners, Hunt’s book details a series of innovative ways of developing students’ translation skills. In one example from a research paper, a university tutor struggling to get his students to engage with Virgil’s poetry, asked them to translate well-known songs instead. Among their successes was Taylor Swift’s hit Bad Blood, the chorus to which was translated as Quod, care, nunc malum sanguinem habemus. Elsewhere, another Latin enthusiast has recorded Disney favourites in Latin including Let it Go (Libera) from Frozen, while 3D digital modelling and Google Earth have helped students to use Latin while walking through virtual ancient sites, including a 3D model of Rome built in Minecraft. “The trouble with Latin teaching is that it’s never been subject to thorough academic investigation; we tend to rely on anecdotal information about what seems to work,” said Hunt, who hated Latin when he first studied it at the age of 11 and is horrified that he once taught Latin using texts which trivialised slavery and stereotyped female characters. “There is no ‘best way’ to teach it,” he said, “but some teachers are creating a rich set of responses to the challenge. Most draw on principles from modern languages education. Because the human brain is hardwired for sound, it learns by speaking, listening and using language. Some Latin teachers are realising that this is the way to learn any language – dead or alive.” Last summer the Department for Education announced the launch of a £4m scheme to encourage Latin among secondary state school students, starting initially in 40 schools in England, as part of a four-year pilot programme for 11- to 16-year-olds. “Latin’s role as the gatekeeper to an elite education is over, but involving more students, especially in state schools, remains a problem,” said Hunt. “The challenge for teachers in the years to come will be whether they are prepared to grasp these opportunities to present the subject differently, and widen the appeal for students, or whether they prefer to stick to familiar routines.” Taylor Swift: Bad Blood Verse 1 Did you have to do this? I was thinking that you could be trusted 10 Did you have to ruin what was shiny? Now it’s all rusted Did you have to hit me where I’m weak? Baby, I couldn’t breathe And rub it in so deep 15 Salt in the wound like you’re laughing right at me Chorus ’Cause baby, now we’ve got bad blood You know it used to be mad love So take a look what you’ve done ’Cause baby, now we’ve got bad blood, hey!

4/7/2022,"More than one in 10 residents of some of London’s wealthiest neighbourhoods have claimed “non-dom” status at some point, meaning they paid no tax on their offshore income. UK-based people who have benefited from this special tax status by claiming another country as their legal “domicile” made up more than 12% of residents in two parliamentary constituencies in 2018 – Kensington, and the Cities of London and Westminster, according to an analysis of HM Revenue and Customs data. In five of the most affluent council wards they accounted for more than a quarter of residents. The study by the London School of Economics and the University of Warwick found that the number of people who had ever claimed non-dom status in the UK rose from 162,000 in 2001 to 238,000 in 2018. It found that these people were most commonly working in finance, management consultancy and accountancy, with 22% of top earning bankers having claimed non-dom status. It emerged on Wednesday that Akshata Murthy, the wife of Rishi Sunak, claims non-dom status, which would allow her to save millions of pounds in tax on dividends collected from her families IT business empire. The highest earning non-doms work in the film industry and sport, likely to be famous actors, directors, producers and Premier League football players, according to the researchers. Their average earnings in 2018 were £2m, almost four times more than the income of non-dom bankers. Outside London, some of the highest numbers of non-doms were found in Oxford and Cambridge, where they made up more than 1% of the population in two parliamentary constituencies. These included 310 people working in higher education, who the researchers said were likely to be foreign senior managers and professors employed by the two elite universities. Non-doms pay no tax on income or capital gains accrued outside the UK, unless they bring the money into the country. This has allowed the super-rich, such as Roman Abramovich, owner of Chelsea football club, Lakshmi Mittal, the steel tycoon, and the media baron Viscount Rothermere, to avoid paying significant sums to HMRC. The study, The UK’s ‘non-doms’: Who are they, what do they do, and where do they live?, analysed the anonymised personal tax returns of everyone who claimed non-dom status at some point between 1997 and 2018. It found that non-doms made up two-fifths of top earners – those whose annual income was more than £125,000 – in the oil industry, a quarter of those in the car industry and a sixth of those in film and sports. The very wealthy were most likely to claim non-dom status, according to the researchers. More than two-fifths of those who earned £5m or more in 2018 have claimed non-dom status at some point since 1997, compared with less than three in 1,000 among those whose income was under £100,000. This trend was even greater among migrants, with 84% for those earning above £5m having claimed non-dom status at some point. One of the report’s authors, Mike Savage, professor of sociology at LSE, said the report showed that non-dom status has contributed to inequality in the UK by attracting the global super-rich to work here. He said: “What this study is really showing is that inequality in the UK isn’t just a British problem, it’s to do with the way in which rich people, who can command a high income, are working in the UK. We assume [they’re coming here] because the non-dom clause is an attractive part of the package they get here. So it’s facilitating the rise of the super rich.” More than 93% of non-doms were born abroad, coming mainly from the US, India and western Europe, especially France, Germany and Italy, the study found. The number of Indian non-doms has risen most rapidly, from about 4% of the total in 2001 (3,200) to almost 14% in 2018 (22,700). The study also found that migrant non-doms cluster in national enclaves in London. Western European non-doms are predominantly found in Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea. American non-doms are most prevalent in Islington, Camden and Hackney. Those from other English-speaking countries, including Australia, Canada and South Africa, are clustered around Wandsworth, Merton and Richmond, as well as in Surrey. Meanwhile, Indian non-doms reside in more suburban areas such as Harrow, Hillingdon and Bromley.",News/UK news,Non-doms: 12% of residents in London’s richest parts claimed status in 2018,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/07/non-doms-12-of-residents-in-londons-richest-parts-claimed-status-in-2018
4/7/2022,"In February 2003, the UK bhangra producer and rapper Panjabi MC played a DJ set in Germany, then flew by private jet to Switzerland to play twice more that same evening. His song Mundian To Bach Ke had recently been rereleased. Having spent five years on a closed circuit of British Asian weddings, family functions, radio shows and club nights, it would soon reach the UK Top 5 and No 1 in Italy, Hungary, Belgium and Greece. Touching down at Birmingham airport after the tour, his manager Rekha Sagoo received a call from the promoter. “I’ll always remember it,” she says. “Jay-Z had been in Switzerland and heard Bach Ke blasting through the walls and wanted to add his own verse.” The remix that soon followed (called Beware of the Boys) took the song back into the charts again in 2003, and Jay-Z performed it at Glastonbury in 2008. The success gave bhangra music a boost around the world and made Panjabi MC a household name. But many people remember him as a one-hit wonder, disregarding his vast legacy to British Asian culture, let alone his ongoing music career. “How much detail shall I go into?” he asks, sitting in his studio complex in Nuneaton. Panjabi MC, AKA Rajinder Singh Rai, is stroking a fluffy grey cat, and at 49 he has a warm presence, like a wise, mischievous uncle. After the bloody partition of India in 1947, many families emigrating from the severed region of Punjab arrived in the Midlands, where men found work in metal foundries. Rai’s grandparents settled in Coventry, where he was born. He grew up Sikh in a traditional home. “We spoke Punjabi. I had a good time. But Cov did have a skinhead problem,” he says. The National Front would mobilise after games at the football stadium, and he remembers hiding from them with his grandmother inside British Home Stores. Anger about immigration and unemployment in Margaret Thatcher’s Britain was bubbling, but so was a multicultural melting pot, and Coventry became the birthplace of the 2 tone scene that spliced punk and ska. Rai’s childhood bedroom backed on to a pub that hosted reggae bands. As he fell asleep, “all I could hear was the bassline,” he says. At community weddings, he would watch the bhangra bands set up their equipment. “I never wanted to go on the dancefloor. I wanted to be on stage.” Bhangra originated as a harvest dance from the Punjab and evolved once it married with electronic instrumentation in the UK. Prominent bands such as Apna Sangeet, Alaap, Heera and DCS toured the UK during the 1980s; so, too, did Sufi qawwali singers visiting from India and Pakistan, such as Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. For young British Punjabis, be they Sikhs, Hindus or Muslims, music preserved their heritage – language and wisdom via the ancient vocal scales of singers; pride in the thwack of the dhol – while Black music from the US spoke to a shared feeling of otherness among working-class migrant communities. Hip-hop filtered in from America: “We used to send someone down to London with a ghetto blaster to record Tim Westwood’s Capital radio show,” says Rai, who would bunk off school to dance at “daytimer” parties organised for young south Asians who weren’t allowed out at night. After seeing Stevie Wonder use a sampler on Sesame Street, he worked in a clothes factory to save up for “my own little lab”, which he used to deconstruct and blend the voices of his parents’ favourite singers with rap and dance music. This sampling was a hip-hop method but also an example of jugaad: the Indian method of bending rules to solve practical problems. “I loved all the original bhangra songs, but they were recorded live, so they were loose. My thing was to tighten them up,” he says. In his early teens, Rai had also practised rapping at a Caribbean social club, where others would call him Indian MC. “I told them: ‘Indian isn’t a language, it’s Punjabi!’” he says. The new name stuck. “He made music that reflected a lived experience of having multiple generations in one household,” says DJ Yung Singh, a member of south Asian music collective Daytimers and the producer of The Birth of Punjabi Garage, a new Ministry of Sound documentary. “The older generations appreciated that he sampled so much of the stuff they grew up listening to.” Apache Indian and Bally Sagoo, both from Birmingham, had developed reputations for mixing Indian music with reggae, dancehall and disco (“Bally was the guy to catch,” Rai says). Trying his own hand at forging musical hybridity, Rai fused disparate styles on his first three albums as Panjabi MC – Souled Out (1993), Another Sellout (1994) and 100% Proof (1995) – and his single Jogi would later chart across Europe. “I remember getting Souled Out and being blown away,” says New York’s DJ Rekha, whose club night Basement Bhangra, which Rai played at many times, ran from 19972017. “I’m often playing to an audience here that is not deeply familiar with Indian music – it really has to cut through. P’s production style was so different, it’s sharp to the ears.” In 1996, Rai travelled to Punjab to record his fourth album. “Someone said to me: ‘Why are you sampling these guys from your mum’s record collection when they’re still alive?’” he recalls. A friend helped track his heroes down and rented a studio in the bustling city of Ludhiana. Rai forgot his metronome, so he recorded a dripping tap on his dictaphone to keep his collaborators in time. By now, the Asian underground scene was establishing itself with artists such as Talvin Singh, State of Bengal and Asian Dub Foundation combining the myriad sounds of south Asia with UK electronica and drum’n’bass – a strong foundation for Panjabi MC’s 1998 masterwork, Legalised. It opened with Mundian To Bach Ke. Rai had sampled the theme tune from the 1980s television show Knight Rider; its tumbi riff was played by KS Bhamrah from 80s band Apna Sangeet; the vocals were by Labh Janjua, a folk singer whom Rai first collaborated with on his trip to Ludhiana. DJ and broadcaster Bobby Friction remembers buying Legalised on CD in Southall, and the euphoria of playing Mundian To Bach Ke. “I was playing all this underground stuff, but I could drop that in the middle of a set and give a nod to my roots – it was me going: this one’s for the Punjabis!” In 2002, Friction began co-hosting a show that platformed South Asian music on BBC Radio 1 with Nihal Arthanayake. After years of circulation on dancefloors across the UK, the efforts of Rai’s label head Ninder Johal combined with support from other specialist DJs such as Trevor Nelson and Tim Westwood and the fact that “every radio plugger who entered the BBC building was talking about it,” according to Friction, Bach Ke was added to the national channel’s heavily guarded playlist. Rai named his album Legalised to signal that, unlike previous releases, the samples had been cleared. But when Bach Ke started blowing up, he discovered that he didn’t have publishing rights for the Knight Rider theme. Universal Music Group took 90% of the publishing share. “We lost a lot of money,” he concedes. Nonetheless, it was a triumphant period. In 2003, Panjabi MC appeared on Top of the Pops, was awarded best dance act by MTV Europe, and won a Mobo award. Bach Ke opened the door for British Punjabi music being played not only in the UK, but across the globe, from India to America. DJ Rekha was driving through New York when she heard Bach Ke being played on the revered hip-hop radio station Hot 97. “I had to stop the car. I had a lump in my throat. I just couldn’t believe it,” she says. While Panjabi MC continued to bridge his sound with other timely genres, as on the UK garage-filled 2001 album Dhol Jageero Da, the early millennium saw a new generation of UK bhangra-inflected artists come to the fore, chart success for British Punjabi R&B singer Jay Sean, and increased funding for BBC Asian Network. US producer Timbaland – who, on a visit to London, stopped by ABC Music in Southall to look for samples – drew from Indian instrumentation to make Missy Elliot’s Get Ur Freak On, while Truth Hurts had a global R&B hit with the Lata Mangeshkar-sampling Addictive. “Labels suddenly thought that bhangra was the new thing,” Rai says. In his opinion, this led to saturation. At nightclubs, “I’d come on as the headline act after two or three hours’ of other acts, and by that time the crowd didn’t wanna hear more Indian stuff! They’d be like: we’ve had enough of this, mate!” He shakes his head and chuckles. “They overdid it. But people live and learn. Our kids will see where we went wrong, and their kids will see where they went wrong.” To this day, Mundian To Bach Ke holds a proud significance for many British Punjabis and south Asians. It is still a favourite across the dancefloors of continental Europe and it recently soundtracked a new commercial for German eye-wear brand, Brille Fielmann. But the song is also uncomfortable for those who saw it appropriated. “When it comes on now, people in the Asian music industry will groan. But that’s not because of the tune. The tune is powerful,” says Friction. “It’s because for years it was played whenever anything Asian came on the television – anytime someone cooked a curry on Come Dine With Me. And that took a lot of the cultural meaning away. It showed south Asians how two-dimensional the rest of society saw us.” Demand for Panjabi MC’s live shows grew exponentially after Bach Ke. “From 2002 to 2015 it just got hotter and hotter,” he says. The spread of Holi-themed festivals across Europe in the 2010s took him and his song everywhere; “I’d have 25-gig contracts in Russia sorted at the start of the year.” He has continued to make popular music, not least the global hit Moorni (Balle Balle) from his 2011 album The Raj, but Rai admits he found it hard to keep up with how software development, streaming platforms and social media were restitching the fabric of music. “Now, the race is not only with other producers in England, it’s with producers in India, too. And you can’t compete with India. There is so much music coming from there.” The country’s modernisation and the ballooning of its middle class means that a UK-based producer no longer has a technological advantage. If anything, the tables have turned. “Bhangra here has always been specialised; in India it’s mainstream. Any kid in the pind [village] can get themselves a USB stick with a million pounds’ worth of software on it for £50.” But Rai stands by the belief that the folk sound he grew up listening to will never be overtaken. “It’s like telling someone to remix Motown – forget it, the originals sound better. The analog sound is the best.” Panjabi MC’s latest single, Barood, was released on Christmas Eve, with a trademark tumbi melody and fresh trap bassline, and vocals by the London folk singer Raf Saperra, who also directed the music video. “In terms of being the man who has taken Punjabi music global, there are no three, four, five ways about it – it’s Panjabi MC,” says Saperra. “I can’t easily put into words how important his influence has been to me.” “He put us Cov boys on the map,” says Coventry rap producer Coolie. “If it wasn’t for Panjabi MC, you wouldn’t see someone like me in the UK rap scene, doing what I do.” In February 2021, he co-produced a drill anthem, Kisaan, which features popular Birmingham vocalist Jaz Dhami and regional rappers like Jay1 and Temz to raise money and awareness for the farmer protests in India. The 20-year-old BBC Asian Network DJ Kizzi grew up in a household soundtracked by Panjabi MC. “For both my parents he was like the godfather,” she says, adding that “he’s one of the only artists who has adapted himself to the younger generation.” “I never thought bhangra music from England was going to be listened to by people who don’t even understand it,” Rai concludes. “When I was watching Blue Peter when I was 16 years old, I thought: one day, I’m gonna be abseiling down mountains, parachuting, watching football in stadiums, behind a speedboat, waterskiing … I ain’t done none of that. I spent my time in labs like this. But now I know my music.” Our interview finishes and Rai invites me into a room where his friends have gathered on sofas for a drink. He puts on a video of Stevie Wonder performing live and makes everyone stop talking to listen. As I leave, the instrumental for Tupac’s Hail Mary is blasting from a soundsystem. Someone has picked up a tumbi to improvise a corresponding melody, and Panjabi MC has started freestyling again.",Arts/Music,Look back in bhangra: Panjabi MC on becoming a British Asian pop icon,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/07/how-panjabi-mc-became-a-british-asian-icon-bhangra
4/7/2022,"About 50 Tory MPs could force the government to toughen up its ban on conversion practices by backing a move to extend the protections to transgender people, the Guardian has been told. Campaigners fighting for Downing Street to commit to outlawing the controversial exercise said “the battle is definitely still on” and remained confident that No 10 would either be swayed or defeated in the remaining months. Insiders said No 10 was warned on Monday that they “might still lose” if the prime minister, Boris Johnson, chose to stick to his decision to water down the long-promised ban on so-called conversion “therapy”, by excluding people from it who are questioning their gender. The Government Equalities Office was also said to have estimated that if the protections for trans people were stripped out of the bill, about 50 Conservative MPs could vote to add it back in. Johnson reneged on a commitment for the conversion practices ban to cover all those who are LGBT last week, but partially backtracked in the face of a huge backlash from some of his own MPs. A government spokesperson blamed “the complexity of issues and need for further careful thought” on the decision to leave out transgender conversion practices while “separate work” is carried out. The answer was given short shrift by those who have pushed for a ban on coercive or torturous practices designed to stop someone from reconsidering their gender or sexuality, given they said intricate work on the issue had been underway for years. They also scoffed at the suggestion apparently made by No 10 earlier this week that a royal commission would be set up to examine the issue, suggesting this would delay dealing with it indefinitely. Crispin Blunt, a Conservative MP and chair of the parliamentary group on global LGBTQ+ rights, said it was “disappointing that our prime minister has yet to fully appreciate the sensitivities and complexities around gender identity as well as sexuality”. Another Tory backbencher, Elliot Colburn, said he was “extremely concerned” at the “incredibly poorly judged” decision to exclude protecting transgender people from the ban on conversion practices. “Excluding anyone from the scope of the ban sends the wrong signals,” he said. “Many other countries and territories have managed to pass these bans, we need to do the same. Fuelling the fire and giving into some kind of culture war will benefit no one.” Patrick Corrigan of Amnesty International UK said: “A ban on conversion therapy that excludes trans and non-binary people is not a real ban on conversion therapy. Human rights cannot be applied selectively.” But some Conservatives are pleased Johnson has been swayed to take a softer approach on the issue, believing that conversion practices are already prohibited by existing laws or would be too hard to ban that they would end up unfairly targeting faith leaders or medical professionals. Dominic Raab, the deputy prime minister, said on Wednesday that Johnson’s position was correct, and added: “We should be able to discuss these sensitive issues with mutual tolerance.”",News/Politics,"Battle still on to protect trans people under conversion ban, say Tory MPs",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/07/uk-conversion-therapy-ban-transgender-people-tory-mps
4/7/2022,"YouTube has suspended the account of a Chinese national in Odessa who has criticised Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine after being reported to the platform for content containing “suspected violence”. Wang Jixian, whose daily Mandarin vlogs detailing his life in the Ukrainian city made him an internet sensation, was temporarily suspended on Thursday last week. In his video immediately before the suspension, his video showed Chinese translations of a voice recording of Ukrainians speaking about atrocities committed by Russian soldiers. The Beijing native began posting daily vlogs on his YouTube channel shortly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. “Today is … I am still in Odesa. I am still alive,” his videos begin. His daily updates quickly drew more than 100,000 followers but also the ire of China’s legions of nationalistic netizens. His channel suddenly went quiet last week. The programmer told his followers on Twitter that his appeal against the suspension was rejected last week. YouTube temporarily suspends reported accounts for potential violations for one week, which may be extended to 90 days if violations continue. YouTube has been contacted for comment. Wang told Radio Free Asia he didn’t blame YouTube, but the “ulterior motives” of whoever reported him, saying: “where is the violence? I didn’t include photos [of violence] in my video.” Undeterred, Wang created a new YouTube channel to continue his daily updates. His new account, created last Thursday, hosts a six-day streak of videos and has already garnered 34,000 followers. Followers posted messages of relief on his new channel. “I admire your courage,” one wrote. Despite his loyal following, Wang’s support for Ukraine chafes with the narrative that China is enforcing on its citizens back home. Chinese state media has reported atrocities in the town of Bucha earlier this week as a “show” the Ukrainian side was putting on for the west, and largely portrays Russia as a victim in the conflict. The suspension followed weeks of harassment of his family members in China and the deletion of his WeChat account in mid-March. “What are you scared of? Is my voice really that terrifying?” Wang said in a video addressing WeChat’s deletion of his account.",News/Technology,YouTube suspends account of Chinese vlogger reporting from Ukraine on atrocities,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/07/youtube-suspends-account-of-chinese-vlogger-reporting-from-ukraine-on-atrocities
4/7/2022,"Australians’ chances of winning the Oz Lotto jackpot are set to become slimmer after changes to the game by the Victorian government. The state government has amended the Public Lottery Licence to introduce two extra balls for Oz Lotto, which currently has participants select seven choices from 45 numbers, with two supplementary numbers drawn. That matrix will be changed so participants select from 47 numbers, while three supplementary numbers will be drawn. The changes, which come into effect on 11 May, mean the overall odds of winning any prize across all divisions will increase from one in 55 to one in 50. However, the odds of winning first division has been changed from one in 45.3 million to one in 62.8 million. Oz Lotto entrants in all states and territories will be affected, given the game is licensed in Victoria. The government said the changes mean there would be more chances of winning, not less, given the increase in likelihood of large jackpots. But the opposition’s spokesperson for gaming, Steph Ryan, described it as a “blatant cash grab” as larger jackpots provide more taxation revenue for Victoria. “By adding extra numbers to the lottery, the government is ensuring that it’s harder to win, which means it’s going to jackpot more, and bigger jackpots lead to bigger ticket sales,” she told reporters outside parliament on Thursday. “This is just another desperate grab for cash from the Andrews government to try and plug its failure to manage its own budget.” “It’s hard to imagine a more stingy move than making Oz Lotto so much harder to win.” According to the 2021/22 budget update, released in December, the state collected $599m from public lottery taxes in the financial year, about $15m more than initially forecast. This revenue is expected to increase to $624m in 2022/23, $640m in 2023/24 and $658m in 2024/25. The majority of gambling taxation revenue is allocated to funding for community organisations, mental health services, programs to tackle problem gambling, including funding for the Victorian Responsible Gambling Foundation, as well as drug education, treatment and rehabilitation. Victoria’s sports minister, Martin Pakula, said he has played lotteries for decades and the division one changes don’t bother him. “I think for most of us the difference between a one in 40 million and a one in 60 million chance is pretty academic to be honest,” he said. “I’ve played TattsLotto for 30 years and I’ve never won first division and probably never will.”",News/Australia news,"Victoria’s Oz Lotto changes make it harder to win jackpot and are ‘blatant cash grab’, opposition says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/07/victorias-oz-lotto-changes-make-it-harder-to-win-jackpot-and-are-blatant-cash-grab-opposition-says
