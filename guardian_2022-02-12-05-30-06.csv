2/12/2022,"Company Chameleon’s The Shadow, directed by Anthony Missen, continues to mine the seam on which the longstanding Manchester company has built its reputation: fiercely physical dance-theatre exploring interpersonal relationships. Here, the guiding principle is Jung’s notion of the shadow self: those aspects of our lives that we hide from others, even from ourselves. It’s a loose theme that holds together the somewhat disparate scenes of this hour-long work, and dominates its lighting (tenebrous) and music (ominous).  The most intriguing figure of the six-strong cast, played by veteran dancer Lee Clayden, bookends the piece but – aptly enough – often appears in the dark or on the edge of the action in between. Who is he? In the strong opening scene, he lies smothered by the bodies of “shadows” (six black-clad extras, recruited locally), a repressed presence in a scene otherwise given over to Reece Marshall – an elastic and terrifically fearless mover, who tumbles and hurls in pursuit of unseen ghosts. Elsewhere, Clayden looms like a distant guide or witness, watching childlike games from the sidelines like the shadow of adulthood, or steering Marshall’s steps like a father figure, both caring and controlling. While Clayden and the shadows form a mobile, sometimes interventionist hinterland to the piece, its foreground is given to scenes of ambivalent drive and drama. There’s a bruising battle between Gustavo Oliveira and David Colley – or might they be shadow-boxing, their targets more imagined than real? Three couples coalesce between characters and their shadows, then interchange and reform, mixing self with other as well as self with shadow. Colley reappears as a slave-dog in a cage, taunted by a supercilious Alice Bonazzi, who offers and withholds sips of water. Cruel torment or consensual powerplay? Perhaps both. Individually, these scenes are packed with inventive movement ideas, but cumulatively they tend to dissipate some of the work’s mysteries – the equivocal dance between persona and shadow, the real-world weight of imagined presences – in favour of physical overdrive, amplified by booms and surges of sound. A little more light and shade might be welcome.

2/12/2022,"The father of a man who shot dead five people in Plymouth has said he told police he did not believe his son should have a shotgun because he was concerned about his mental health. Mark Davison said he was ashamed of his son Jake, 22, who shot dead his mother and four other people before killing himself in August.  The Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) is investigating why apprentice crane operator Davison was allowed to have a shotgun though he had a history of violence and had expressed extreme misogynistic views. It confirmed on Friday evening that it had spoken to Davison’s father and its report would be published soon. Speaking to the BBC on the six month anniversary of the shootings, Mark Davison said he called the police at a time when he had concerns about his son’s mental health. “I told them. I said I don’t want him to have a shotgun,” he said. “Why did he even need one in the first place? He lived in the city. If he was a farmer or whatever … then yes maybe then, but he shouldn’t have had the gun in the first place.” Davison, who was divorced from Jake Davison’s mother, Maxine, said he was “sorry and ashamed” at his son’s crimes. Among the victims was three-year-old Sophie Martyn, who was walking the family dog with her father, Lee, 43. Davison said: “That three-year-old little girl, and the other victims. People just going about their lives, going to the park or going to the shop, taking the dog or whatever they were doing. “Whatever Jake’s mitigation was it’s still no form of defence. He shouldn’t have done that. He shouldn’t have had a gun in the first place.” The killings happened just weeks after Jake Davison’s shotgun and licence were returned to him by Devon and Cornwall police. They had been seized after he assaulted two teenagers in a park. The IOPC said: “We can confirm we have spoken to Mr Davison and his statement that he made a call to Devon and Cornwall police has been considered and reported on as part of our independent investigation.” IOPC regional director David Ford said it had completed the “vast majority” of its investigation. He said: “It is vitally important that we, and others, seek to identify what changes could be made to reduce the risk of any repeat of the horrific events of last August. As part of our investigation determinations, we will be considering both local and national learning recommendations around firearms licensing procedures.” Devon and Cornwall police said it was co-operating with the IOPC and providing all information required for its investigation. A spokesman said: “Individual contacts with Jake Davison by members of his family, members of the public or agencies that are known to us, or exist within our systems, form part of that investigation. “The outcome of that investigation will be shared by the IOPC with the families, coroner and ourselves at a later date. As a result, Devon and Cornwall police is unable to comment further on any matters that are subject to independent investigation and review.” ",News/UK news,Father of Plymouth shooter says he told police his son should not be allowed gun,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/11/father-of-plymouth-shooter-says-he-told-police-his-son-should-not-be-allowed-gun
