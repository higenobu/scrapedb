1/19/2022,"By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co was sued for $10 million on Tuesday by a 68-year-old Florida woman who said the carrier ejected her from a flight because she periodically needed to remove her mask to drink water. Medora Clai Reading said she was wrongly removed from a Jan. 7, 2021, flight to Palm Beach, Florida, from Washington, D.C. after a hostile flight attendant kept demanding that she keep her mask on despite medical issues, including a heart condition and low blood sugar, requiring that she stay hydrated. Southwest had no immediate comment, having yet to review the complaint. Reading's lawsuit in federal court in Brooklyn differs from disputes focused on travelers who are unwilling to wear masks. The Federal Aviation Administration said airline crews in 2021 submitted 5,981 reports of unruly passengers, including 4,290 incidents related to masks. In her complaint, Reading said that she offered to show the attendant her medical exemption card but was told, ""we don't care,"" and that the attendant objected to her later sipping water by shouting: ""You were talking!"" Reading said a gate attendant eventually ordered her off the flight, as an unmasked pilot ""laughed mockingly"" as she tearfully exited. She said nearby police helped her to a chair and offered water, while commenting that similar occurrences were ""happening far too often"" and ""it is usually Southwest."" Kristina Heuser, a lawyer for Reading, in an interview said a ""planeload full of witnesses"" saw the encounter, and some may have videotaped it. Heuser said Southwest's ""hostile and abusive"" conduct reflected a ""COVID insanity"" that should not override federal laws protecting people with medical disabilities. Reading's lawsuit alleges violations of the federal Air Carrier Access Act and various civil rights laws. The flight attendant, two gate officials and the pilot, none of whom is identified by name, are also defendants. The case is Reading v Southwest Airlines Co et al, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 22-00265.

1/19/2022,"An estate in Great Falls, Virginia, with a rich history is set to be destroyed if a buyer doesn’t step up to save it. Cornwell Farm, an estate that’s listed on the National Register of Historic Places, according to the farm’s website, is on the market for $3.7 million. The community of Great Falls has come together to attempt to save the property. The farm’s historic roots can be traced to the 1800s when the Jackson family accumulated hundreds of acres of land in the area, GeorgetownPike.org said. John Jackson gave the land to his son John T., who built on the land and later gifted the brick manor to his daughter Julia prior to the Civil War. “The ‘new brick house’ first appears on county tax rolls in 1831, still listed as unfinished, but with an assessment of $1,850,” the Cornwell Farm website says. “After nearly 80 years under the care of the Jackson family, the property was finally sold in 1868 to Benjamin F. and Phoebe Cornwell for $2,500.” According to The Washington Post, the farm was a place where Union soldiers camped and “inscribed their names on the plaster walls.” The four-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bathroom estate is 5,102 square feet of dignified elegance and sits quietly on the rolling green hills of Great Falls. The property also has a four-stall barn and a caretaker’s cottage. Features that stand out in the home include: Nine wood-burning fireplaces Four chimneys High ceilings New roof Swimming pool The Georgetown Pike Rural Preservation Trust is working to preserve the properties in the area thanks to increased traffic and noise pollution since the number of households in the area has tripled over the past two decades, the GeorgetownPike.org website says. “As a result, our community has become a less desirable place to live in, reflected in property values that have remained stagnant during a decade when the nationwide housing market has appreciated significantly,” the website says.

1/19/2022,"KNOX — Heinous. Horrendous. Horrible. Unspeakable. Hard to comprehend. Those are the words Starke Circuit Court Judge Kim Hall used to describe the murder of 11-month-old Mercedes Lain at the hands of Justin Miller before sentencing him Tuesday to 65 years in prison. “What you did on this day when you killed this baby was an act that is as bad as a human can commit,” Hall said. As Hall issued the sentence and Miller was led away, members of Mercedes' family cried and hugged in the gallery of the court room. Miller, 37, pleaded guilty to killing the child last month in a deal that saw prosecutors dismiss a habitual offender enhancement, which could have added as many as 20 years to his sentence. After hearing testimony from detectives with the Plymouth Police Department and the FBI — who detailed how Miller initially lied to police about Mercedes’ whereabouts before eventually showing investigators where he left the baby’s body in Starke County — Hall accepted the agreement and sentenced Miller. Tami Napier, a special deputy prosecuting attorney handling the case, asked for the maximum sentence for Miller, noting the brutality of the crime and how he repeatedly lied to investigators. “This was not a quick, painless situation. This was a vicious, sustained, brutal attack on a 10-month-old child,” she said. More: Mercedes Lain's babysitter pleads guilty to murder in Plymouth toddler's death Alexander Hoover, an attorney representing Miller, argued that without Miller’s eventual cooperation, investigators would not have found Mercedes’ body, giving some closure to the family. He also noted how quickly Miller pleaded guilty to the offense. Ultimately, Hall said, the fact that Mercedes was less than a year old and was dependent on Miller to take care of her led him to issue the 65-year term. Mercedes' parents met Miller at a motel in Plymouth on Aug. 12 and gave the infant to him to babysit so they ""could have a break,"" court documents say. The infant's father, Kenneth Lain, was initially in contact with Miller via text, but Miller stopped responding on Aug. 14. The next day, Lain contacted Plymouth police to file a missing person report for his daughter, court documents say. A Silver Alert was issued that night and the search for Mercedes began, with officers from multiple agencies in Marshall County and the FBI getting involved. Police arrested Miller in the early morning of Aug. 16 in Starke County. Police also arrested Lain and Tiffany Coburn, Mercedes' mother, and both now face child neglect charges. Detective Ben McIntyre testified Tuesday that Miller was initially evasive about where Mercedes was, saying he dropped the baby off with a woman at a motel in Plymouth. Eventually, police learned that Miller had stayed at his girlfriend’s apartment in Mishawaka the night of Aug. 13, with Miller and Mercedes sleeping on a futon in one room and his girlfriend in a separate bedroom. FBI agent Tim Freel testified that Miller and his girlfriend were fighting and at a couple points throughout the night, Miller’s girlfriend went into Miller’s sleeping area to argue, waking up Mercedes. At some point early in the morning of Aug. 14, Miller hit Mercedes multiple times, causing what McIntyre called “excessive and pretty insane” injuries, including extensive bruising, hemorrhaging in her brain, and cuts and swelling to her eye, cheek, mouth and chin. Miller eventually led investigators to the area in Starke County, near the intersection of County Road 1025 East and 50 North, where he wrapped Mercedes' body in a pink blanket and covered the site with refuse, including a broken porcelain toilet seat. Police also testified that they found a number of items in Miller’s car with both his and Mercedes’ blood on them. After testimony from law enforcement, Mercedes’ grandmother, Angela Owens spoke, saying Miller “took everything” from the child he was supposed to care for. “The rest of our lives are now hell, so why shouldn’t yours be?” she said, speaking to Miller from the back of the courtroom. Miller stared straight ahead as she read her statement. Miller’s wife, who said she is currently filing for a divorce, briefly spoke on his behalf saying he has never been violent before. “I just don’t understand why this happened,” she said. “That poor baby, she didn’t deserve this.” Kenneth Lain and Tiffany Coburn are set for hearings this week on child neglect charges. Lain intends to file a plea agreement, records show. Email Marek Mazurek at mmazurek@sbtinfo.com.

1/19/2022,"Despite the resistance he’s faced from his party over his opposition to reforming the legislative filibuster through unconventional avenues, moderate Democratic Senator Joe Manchin said he won’t be surrendering his long-held position. Ahead of a Democratic Caucus meeting Tuesday evening, Manchin told the press that he will refuse to support a return to the “talking filibuster,” which would nix the 60-vote threshold needed to advance legislation through the Senate, allowing Democrats to move their voting package across the finish line. The “talking filibuster” is an old-fashioned style for the rule requiring at least one member of the minority to command the Senate floor to maintain the filibuster. Democrats shifted strategy to resurrecting the “talking filibuster” after their last pitch to allow a “carve-out” for the voting bill, exempting it from the 60-vote hurdle, failed last week. While Manchin has been amenable to revising the filibuster, but not outright abolishing it, he rejected the Democrats’ idea of using a simple majority vote to do so, otherwise known as the “nuclear option,” which has scarcely been exercised and Republicans fear is a slippery slope to an overhaul of the legislative process. Ordinarily, a rule change for legislative procedure requires two-thirds of members present and voting. Manchin seemed unfazed by suggestions of a primary challenge over what fellow Democrats are calling obstruction on his part, noting that he’s never faltered on his pro-filibuster stance. “I’ve been primaried my entire life. That would not be anything new for me,” he said. While his Democratic colleagues, most notably Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, have flip-flopped on the filibuster when it was politically advantageous, Manchin said he’s always been consistent. “The majority of my colleagues in the Democratic caucus have changed their minds. I respect that. They have a right to change their minds. I haven’t. I hope they respect that too. I’ve never changed my mind on the filibuster,” he added. Despite the fact that Manchin and his centrist counterpart Kyrsten Sinema are crucial to advancing Democratic policy priorities, as they hold the swing votes, the party has resorted to antagonizing the pair for their inflexibility. Manchin said “he doesn’t take anything personally,” as Schumer declared Tuesday that the chamber will end debate Wednesday and proceed with the nuclear option despite insufficient votes. “If Republicans choose to continue the filibuster of voting rights legislation, we must consider and vote on the rules changes,” Schumer said. “Long odds are no excuse for this chamber to avoid this important issue. Again, members of this chamber were elected to debate and to vote. We’re going to vote.” Without Manchin and Sinema’s acquiescence to change the filibuster, however, the Democrats’ voting legislation is all but guaranteed to fail.

1/19/2022,"We may be entering our third year of the COVID-19 pandemic, but we're still getting the hang of testing. And, for people who continue to test positive for coronavirus late into their infection, it may be particularly difficult to know what to do with those results. If you test positive for COVID-19, you can end your isolation after just five days if you never developed symptoms, according to the latest guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Or, if you did develop symptoms, you can leave isolation after you've been without a fever for 24 hours (without using fever-reducing medication), provided your other symptoms are resolving as well. That can be as early as after five full days of isolation, the CDC says. The CDC also amended its guidelines to add that, if you have access to a rapid antigen test, you can take the test at the end of day five of your isolation (as long as you've been fever-free for at least 24 hours). If it's negative, you can use that result to feel more confident about leaving isolation at that time. But if it's positive, the CDC says you should continue isolating through day 10. Regardless of when you end isolation, anyone who tests positive for COVID-19 should take precautions for 10 full days, the CDC says. That includes wearing a mask when around others, avoiding travel and avoiding being around people who are high-risk for severe COVID-19. In the most general terms, people will likely test positive on an at-home rapid COVID-19 test for about six to 10 days, Dr. Stephen Kissler, a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in the department of immunology and infectious diseases, told TODAY. And when it comes to PCR tests, people may test positive for even longer, Dr. Alberto Paniz-Mondolfi, associate professor of pathology, molecular and cell-based medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, explained. ""You can still have positivity that may persist for weeks and even months,"" he explained, noting that positive tests on PCR have been recorded for up to 60 days. But there are a lot of factors that can affect the number of days someone may test positive. Considering that different tests may perform differently “and you have a context of a virus that is in constant evolution, and then you have all these variants, you’re changing the variables of the equation over and over again,” said Paniz-Mondolfi, who also leads the Saliva COVID Test Lab at Mount Sinai. That makes it difficult to predict exactly how long someone may test positive. Even with a rapid test, it's not unheard of for people to test positive up to 14 days, especially for those who are unvaccinated, Kissler said. ""We see a ton of variation between people in how long they test positive,"" he explained. ""While that average is closer to six to 10 days, there are people who will hang on for longer than that."" So, if you're trying to do your due diligence and testing at home frequently during your COVID-19 infection, know that it's possible for you to see positive results for a while. As long as you continue to test positive on a rapid at-home test, you should still consider yourself potentially contagious, Kissler said. But exactly how contagious you are ""will change depending on where you are in the infection,"" he explained. People tend to be most infectious right at the beginning of their COVID-19 infection. So by the time you reach day eight, nine, or 10, ""you still have the chance to spread to other people, but it's probably not as much as you did early in the course of your infection,"" Kissler said. When you get to that point, you have to start weighing your options. It is safest to continue to isolate until you no longer test positive, the experts stressed. But that may not be feasible for everyone. And, taking the new CDC guidelines into account, it's not unreasonable to gradually leave isolation after 10 days — even if you're still testing positive on a rapid test. That's especially true if you're fully vaccinated, any symptoms you developed have resolved and you continue to take as many other precautions as you can until you get that negative result. “You might be able to begin slowly sort of reintegrating while still being mindful of your contact,"" Kissler said. He recommends avoiding enclosed spaces with other people and wearing a mask, preferably something like a KN95 or KF94, when coming into contact with others to limit any potential spread. After 10 days, ""you're good to go and you're even better to go if you keep practicing containment measures,"" Paniz-Mondolfi agreed. ""Keep wearing your mask. Keep practicing social distancing."" And, of course, if you're concerned about how long you've been testing positive, check in with a health care provider for their guidance on your individual situation, Kissler said.

1/19/2022,"A bogus electoral certificate signed by prominent New Mexico Republicans and sent to the national archive in the wake of the 2020 presidential election has gotten new scrutiny over the past week. The peculiar action received scant attention in the shadow of a lawsuit from President Donald Trump's campaign on the day that New Mexico electors gathered at the state Capitol building in Santa Fe to deliver New Mexico's five electoral college votes to Democrats Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for president and vice president. Alternative electoral certificates from New Mexico and six other states were first published by American Oversight and have taken on greater significance as the U.S. House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021 assault on the U.S. Capitol scrutinizes efforts by Trump supporters to subvert the certification of Biden's election win in several states. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, described a similar action by Republicans in that state as ""election fraud"" and referred the case to federal prosecutors while continuing to mull state charges as well, Ann Arbor News reported. New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas, also a Democrat, has similarly referred the New Mexico Republicans' certificate to U.S. Attorney Fred J. Federici. “Election laws are the foundation of our democracy and must be respected,"" Balderas said in a statement. ""While review under state law is ongoing, we have referred this matter to the appropriate federal law-enforcement authorities and will provide any assistance they deem necessary.” OnPolitics: The Electoral Count Act, Jan. 6 and the 2020 Election New Mexico Republicans, for their part, including the signers who argued they might be the rightful electors, have mostly been silent. One of the signers, however, told the Las Cruces Sun-News he has ""no regrets whatsoever."" The state Republican Party did not respond to queries for this story. It was Dec.14, 2020 when Democratic electors cast their votes after Biden won New Mexico's popular vote by 501,614 votes to President Donald Trump's 401,894. The result was executed on a certificate of ascertainment by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and filed according to regular process. On the same day, the Trump campaign filed a lawsuit over New Mexico's use of drop boxes to collect completed ballots, one of a series of measures taken to enhance public safety in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Weeks later, the campaign dropped the matter, but the president continued to assert false claims of widespread voter fraud and insist he was the rightful winner, all evidence — in the wake of audits and recounts in multiple states — to the contrary. Also on Dec. 14, New Mexico Republican electors also turned up at the state capitol and were refused admittance, but nonetheless signed their own election certificate in support of Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. The signers were businessmen Jewll Powdrell and Lupe Garcia; Deborah Maestas, a former state GOP chairperson; Rosie Tripp, a former GOP national committee member from Socorro who has held elected offices; and Anissa Ford-Tinnin, who signed as a substitute for oil businessman (and another former state party chairperson) Harvey Yates. According to the document, the parallel certification was undertaken ""on the understanding that it might later be determined that we are the duly elected and qualified Electors for President and Vice President of the United States of America from New Mexico."" The certificate was then signed and filed with the National Archives and Records Administration. There was, however, never any merit to the claim that New Mexico's election result might be overturned in favor of Trump. ""It didn’t have any real impact on the counting of electoral votes,"" Alex Curtas, a spokesman for New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver, told the Sun-News, adding, ""They didn’t disrupt the actual authentic electoral college count. The election went off as it should have."" More: New Mexico requires tied elections to be decided by games of chance Weeks later, on Jan. 6, 2021, supporters of the president assaulted Congress as it met to finalize the election, after Trump called on them to march to the Capitol during a fiery rally near the White House. After order was restored and the proceedings continued, newly sworn Congresswoman Rep. Yvette Herrell, a Republican representing southern New Mexico, objected to certifying election results in Biden's favor from Arizona and Pennsylvania. Herrell's office did not respond to queries from the Sun-News about the GOP electoral certificates or her thoughts, in retrospect, about the validity of Biden's election. Despite Republican objections in Congress, the election results were confirmed and Biden and Harris were inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2021 in the presence of heightened security at the Capitol and throughout Washington, D.C. Powdrell, a Rio Rancho businessman identified as chairperson on the Republicans' electoral certificate, told the Sun-News he had ""no regrets whatsoever"" about signing the certificate that day. It was Powdrell's first time serving as a presidential elector for his party, and he recalled that after being refused admittance at the state Capitol building, the group signed the certificate in the lobby. He dismissed renewed attention on the certificate as a ""non-issue."" ""Now that the election is over, why are we talking about it?"" he asked, laughing. ""How can you undermine an election that had already been done?"" His intention in signing the certificate was ""to say I support the Republican Party,"" he said, not to undermine the process. Asked whether he accepted Biden's victory in the election as genuine, Powdrell hedged, first saying, ""The election was what it was and unless you’ve got definitive, undisputable, irreversible facts to refute it, it is what it is."" He then suggested that such evidence might exist, but that courts refused to hear it. The Trump campaign and allies filed lawsuits and motions to intervene in several states and before the U.S. Supreme Court in the weeks following the election. None of the challenges prevailed. ""The courts won’t hear it,"" Powdrell said, ""so maybe it’s time that you presented those facts to the general public and let the general public decide."" Curtas said the Secretary of State's Office supported further investigation of the Republicans' certificate, saying what seemed like a stunt in December 2020 was subsequently revealed as part of a darker picture following Jan. 6 and subsequent revelations of efforts to overturn the election for Trump. ""It’s exactly those kind of acts and the narrative they perpetuated that led to the violence on Jan. 6,"" Curtas said. ""They have real consequences and really can undermine our democratic processes."" More: New Mexico delegation in Washington reflects on Jan. 6 Capitol riot Since the Jan. 6 uprising, Curtas said, ""Voting rights is very much in the narrative right now both at the state and federal level,"" including an ambitious package of election proposals Toulouse Oliver and the governor have presented to state lawmakers for the current legislative session. However, he said proposals to address problems such as counterfeit or ""alternative"" electoral certificates are hard to define, noting that the effort did not disrupt the election process directly even if it served to seed doubts in the process.
