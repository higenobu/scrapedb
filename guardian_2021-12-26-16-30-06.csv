12/26/2021,"The damaging effects of Covid-19 on employment and earnings for young people from less affluent backgrounds is revealed in a stark new report on the economic and social fallout from the pandemic. The study – a collaboration between the Resolution Foundation and the London School of Economics and Political Science – finds that young people from less wealthy backgrounds were more than twice as likely to have left work during the first 12 months of the pandemic than those from richer households.  The effects, it argues, would further widen the pay gap between those from rich and poorer backgrounds, and so damage social mobility. Published for The Economy 2030 Inquiry and funded by the Nuffield Foundation, the study also finds that between April 2020 and March 2021, those aged 25 and under who were in work before the pandemic were almost three times as likely to leave work than those aged 26 and over. It found that 41% of young people from the poorest fifth of households left work, compared with 16% of young people from the richest fifth of households. This, the report says, has resulted in deteriorating financial security for many young people from poorer backgrounds. The proportion of young people saying that their financial situation was “all right” or “comfortable” fell from 64% pre-pandemic, to 54% earlier this year. In contrast, levels of financial security among young people from richer backgrounds rose from 79% to 94%. “The economic impact of the pandemic has fallen heavily on young people, and those from less-affluent backgrounds have been at the epicentre of this crisis,” said Andrew Eyles, research economist at the Centre for Economic Performance at the LSE. “While young people have returned to work in droves during the post-lockdown jobs recovery, the legacy of that earlier unemployment risks scarring their wages for years to come. This could risk worsening social mobility in Britain, as the pay gap between those from rich and poor backgrounds could widen over the course of the 2020s.” Previous Resolution Foundation research has shown that young people losing their jobs during a recession can subsequently face wage penalties of between 13% and 21% up to the age of 42, largely as a result of not working, or working in jobs that they are over-qualified for, during the crucial early phase of their careers. The report also finds that children from poorer backgrounds are likely to have been disproportionately affected by Covid’s economic hit to the labour market. It shows that their parents are twice as likely to have lost their jobs at the start of the year compared with parents from richer households. This is likely to cause a knock-on effect on families’ financial security, which is known to affect children’s subsequent performance and attainment at school. “The pandemic has exacerbated existing inequalities and risks a decline in social mobility over the coming years,” said Alex Beer, welfare programme head at the Nuffield Foundation. “This research highlights the importance of effective catch-up in schools, and the need for greater opportunities for adult training and reskilling.” Last month concerns were raised that chancellor Rishi Sunak’s flagship £2bn pandemic jobs scheme to get young people into work might not be delivering value for money. A report by the National Audit Office (NAO), and a separate one by a group of peers, highlighted concerns over the Kickstart scheme, launched by Sunak in September 2020, which offers government-funded “high-quality” job placements for 16- to 24-year-olds who are on universal credit and at risk of long-term unemployment. The NAO, which monitors value for money on public spending, said the Department for Work and Pensions had only “limited assurance” that the scheme was working as intended. Private sector firms that received state subsidies to hire young people might well have done so anyway, the NAO said, because the economy was reopening just as the scheme began to ramp up. The report also found that there was relatively little early take-up for Kickstart due to successive lockdowns depressing demand for workers. Labour said its own analysis had found that the scheme was heavily weighted towards the south, with as many jobs created there as in the north and Midlands combined, despite higher youth unemployment in those regions. The government says its plans for jobs is working with the number of young employees on payrolls back above pre-pandemic levels.",News/Society,Young people from poorer homes twice as likely to quit job since pandemic,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/26/young-people-from-poorer-homes-twice-as-likely-to-quit-job-since-pandemic
12/26/2021," Leslie Winer’s mesmerising face – strong jaw, stern lips, graceful cheekbones – made her a muse to Jean-Paul Gaultier, a star of Dior and Valentino ads and a cover girl for Vogue, though girlish she wasn’t: her tough androgyny and power dressing was the perfect expression of an uncaring yet increasingly permissive 1980s. “I was a reluctant model for five junkie years,” she later said, “I’m also a former nasty alcoholic and former Tampax user, each for more than five years and with considerably more enthusiasm.” That career discarded, her next act was astonishing: music that delved into industrial, dub and – influentially – trip-hop, Winer issuing drawled monologues over the top with Gobi-arid humour. Her work was reissued this year by Light in the Attic on the compilation When I Hit You – You’ll Feel It. Hold On Postcards is its sole unreleased track but maybe its very best. Slurring as if after a boozy nap on a sunbed, her vocal as fried as a bit of fritto misto, Winer slowly recites banal postcard observations from Europe: “Lovely weather, we go to the beach, I’ve been playing boules,” this last revelation with a funny note of astonishment as she stirs briefly out of total indolence. Slipping sunburned and omnipotent from Ajaccio to Nice to Guernsey and beyond, she conjures the listlessness of holidays, and of the wealthy, with a supernatural accuracy. With its piano motifs and sing-song backing vocals, there’s something lulling about this song, and yet a mistral of disquiet feels like it’s about to blow in. “Thinking of you all the time,” she admits amid aloof statements about how many new friends she’s making. Tellingly, her holiday ends – or at least her postcards do – at somewhere called the Hotel Nadir. Ben Beaumont-Thomas One of the most unfairly overlooked songs of 2021 could just as easily have come out during the sooty New York summer of 1981. The Reason for My Love, by the young Brooklyn quintet PE, channels the fidgety, dark, and inescapably danceable sound of Mudd Club-era, underground bands like Bush Tetras, The Contortions and ESG. From the fractured, no-wave sax to its briskly undulating bass line to the haunted vocal of Veronica Torres, every sound in the song confronts and thrills. Like some avant-garde ear worm, the falling-apart sound in the song oddly coheres. More, it extends a mini-trend of young bands who have been refiguring New York’s aural history. Just as the debut album by the teenage Brooklyn group Geese recast the sound of local guitar bands like Television and The Feelies, PE’s song gives Manhattan’s underground club history its own dynamic twist. Jim Farber In less than three minutes and about five lines of lyrics, the mysterious New York/Baltimore producer (and sometime PC Music associate) Doss draws an addictive portrait of power, temptation and danger. “You see me on my own,” she chants, and depending on which way she limns the line, it’s either an invitation to approach or a warning to back away. She repeats her mantras of isolation – “not looking at my phone / Myself, on my own” – with the cadence of an expertly bounced basketball; around her, an intense bubblegum synth motif that contains strange echoes of Benny Benassi’s Satisfaction pings and bungees. It’s a tightly snatched, head-down burst that doubles as a defiant anthem for these past two lonely years. Laura Snapes It’s the heartbreak and hopefulness of a turbulent 2021 from the mind of a songwriter who knows them all too well. Ernie Rossi, owner of century-old gift and music shop E Rossi and Company in New York City’s Little Italy, was sidelined by health problems after reopening following the long city-mandated shutdown. Margaret, his wife of 51 years, knew the neighborhood icon might not stay afloat if doors closed once again and solely took over duties with the couple’s best friend, Freddy. Then this past spring, both Margaret and Freddy caught and died of Covid-19. In the wake of their consecutive deaths, Rossi wrote The Other Side of Forever, a heartfelt tribute to the bond the trio shared and the immense loss he feels. Recorded by the New York indie artist Jenna Esposito, the earworm ballad with a momentous opening and climatic finale was produced in the Italian folk style the store was known for being a chief importer of nearly 100 years ago. And today, Rossi is continuing his fight to stay in business. Rob LeDonne “I’m not sure what to do, at this point I didn’t plan to survive,” DijahSB matter of factly spits on New Harrison, a standout from their latest album Head Above the Waters. Be it such commendably frank rhymes (along with social media posts) about mental health, or being an out-and-proud non-binary artist in a genre once notorious for its heteronormativity, the rising Canadian MC certainly is a trail blazer. But aside from breaking such ground, DijahSB is also a student of the game. Rather than chase trap-rap trends, they choose instrumentals that are both breezy and fresh but also frequently steeped in rap’s soulful old-school grooves. The mellow, melancholy yet cheeky beat for New Harrison is a prime example of DijahSB’s past-meets-future motif. That, along with the MC’s penchant for on-point NBA-inspired punchlines throughout the song’s three-and-a-half-minute runtime, make DijahSB’s potential to be an all-star in their own right abundantly clear. Kyle Mullin There’s something horribly, embarrassingly familiar about the predicament at the centre of 20-year-old Scottish singer Dylan Fraser’s hair-raising track I’d Rather Be Here, released to quiet acclaim this past autumn. The song, which starts with a whisper for attention and ends with a cry for help, is about a specifically awful place to be: in love with someone who is detrimental to your mental health (“the top of these buildings used to feel so tall but maybe that’s ‘cause you made me feel so small”). While many songwriters would use this as a jump-off to celebrate the empowerment that comes attached to then taking flight, Fraser instead focuses in on something far messier: staying there because being with someone harmful is better than being without them. It’s slickly produced but Fraser’s alternately sad and furious desperation is nothing but heartbreakingly genuine.

12/26/2021,"As Billy Connolly observed, there is no such thing as bad weather, just the wrong clothing. The office workers caught in a sudden blizzard on London’s High Holborn in 1966 illustrate Connolly’s point to varying degrees: the young woman on the left, in particular, seems to have dressed for winter sunshine, only to regret her choices more and more as the day has progressed. She now stands poised on the edge of a street of slush, in lacy tights and leaky shoes, preparing for the arctic expedition back to her desk wearing a beret of sleet. She may be some time. A new book, London in the Snow, features several comparable wardrobe errors. Whiteouts are such infrequent events in the capital that they invariably catch a reasonable haul of high heels and shirt sleeves. The book takes in images of the black-and-white decades of the last century, from the years in which the Thames still froze over to the centrally heated 1970s, when the city centre rarely dropped below freezing (there were 116 snow days in London in the 1950s, compared with 36 in the last decade of the 20th century).  In the earlier pictures there are shades of those Dickensian scenes that remain a staple of lamplit Christmas cards (scenes that were already, in Victorian times, nostalgic relics of the “little ice age” of the author’s childhood). Children lining up for a turn on icy slides across playgrounds; pipe-smoking dads tobogganing in tweed and gaberdine; chestnuts roasting on open fires; schoolboys in short trousers with armfuls of snowballs; carollers coated with layers of snow. In most of the later pictures, like this one, the white stuff may be a little thin on the ground – its joys melting into the gutter under bus wheels – but still it retains the soft power of bringing the whole city to a surprising halt.

12/26/2021,"The Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem honours 25,000 individuals who helped to save Jewish lives during the second world war. Among this roll call of the “Righteous among the Nations”, there is only one named Arab: Dr Mohamed Helmy. This remarkable book tells the story of Helmy’s life, in particular the years in which he helped a young Jewish girl, Anna Boros (later Gutman), evade the Nazis in the heart of Berlin from 1936 until the end of the war. Ronen Steinke, a political commentator at German broadsheet Süddeutsche Zeitung, has painstakingly pieced together these events from the state archive in Berlin, and from Gestapo correspondence, and interviews with the surviving relatives of Helmy and Gutman in New York and Cairo. His story, deftly translated by Sharon Howe, wears this research lightly. Steinke’s history sheds a light on what he argues is a deliberately forgotten world, the old Arabic Berlin of the Weimar period, centred around the grand mosque in the Wilmersdorf district, which was “open, progressive and far from antisemitic” and which welcomed Jewish luminaries, including Albert Einstein and philosopher Martin Buber, to its cultural events. “It is a perception shared by many Muslims in western countries that the Holocaust was nothing to do with them, that Muslim migrants played no part in that history,” Steinke writes. “This book is evidence to the contrary.”  Mohamed Helmy, the son of an Egyptian army major, had come to Berlin from Cairo in 1922 to study medicine. He was apprenticed to a professor of medicine at Moabit hospital near the largest synagogue in the city. The professor was Georg Klemperer, brother of Victor, later the forensic diarist of daily life under the terror of the Third Reich. Helmy witnessed first-hand the terrible day in 1933 when all the Jewish doctors at Moabit were rounded up and taken by Nazi stormtroopers to the hospital basement and savagely beaten; those who survived never returned to work. Helmy was spared this fate because he was in a nebulous category in the perverted hierarchy of Hitler’s race laws – not Jewish, not Aryan, and with a native German fiancee. He was promoted to run a department partly staffed by newly employed Nazi surgeons, “devoid of technical expertise”, who had been instructed in part to sterilise young women who had come before the “genetic health courts”. There is a photograph in this book of Helmy seated, surrounded by a smiling cohort of junior Nazi doctors, his murderous underlings. This arrangement did not last long. Helmy, a gifted consultant, was openly derisive of his colleagues and their political masters. When greeted in the hospital corridors with “Heil Hitler!”, he was brave enough to answer with a measured “guten tag”. In 1936, colleagues signed a petition against his continued employment, suspicious that he continued to treat Jewish patients out of hours. He held on for another year, with the help of the Foreign Office at the Reichstag, which did not at that time want to alienate Egypt, then a British protectorate, by persecuting Egyptian citizens. His contract was not renewed in 1937, however, and he was forced to set up his own practice, more or less in secret. A year earlier, Helmy had visited the house of one of his elderly Jewish patients, Cecilie Rudnik. It was not entirely a medical call. Rudnik lived with her daughter, Julie, and granddaughter Anna, then 11. The greengrocer business that Rudnik’s husband ran had been an early victim of the new race laws: Jews were barred from visiting wholesale markets until the afternoons when all the sellable produce had gone. The persecution was getting worse by the day; shops in Moabit were being appropriated by the Nazis, money seized. Rudnik and her daughter offered tea to the doctor and pleaded with him to do something to help Anna. Helmy kept in touch with the family, and when Anna was 14, he took her on as his assistant at his GP practice. At the outbreak of war Helmy’s status was once more in jeopardy. He was imprisoned in 1939 by the Gestapo for apparently calling Rudolf Hess “an idiot”. Some months later, he was released as part of a change of heart at the Nazi foreign office in a bid to persuade prominent Muslims to their cause, or to hold them as future bargaining chips in prisoner exchanges. Helmy was unable to leave Berlin, but allowed to restart his practice. Anna remained his assistant. When the transports began, and Cecilie Rudnik was summoned to the embarkation point, Helmy helped her to go into hiding with a friend. Rudnik’s daughter, Julie, was safe for the time being because she was married to a German gentile. Anna’s status was less secure. Helmy decided, recklessly, to hide her in plain sight. He created the story that Anna had escaped to Romania, while giving her a headscarfed identity as his Muslim niece, Nadia, his new receptionist. What follows is a tense and extraordinary account of their years of subterfuge, which also provides a visceral reminder of the bureaucratic and investigative lengths to which the Gestapo would go to discover Jews still hiding in their midst. With enormous courage and cunning, Helmy and Anna maintained their fiction despite SS raids and constant suspicion and the threats of denunciation and exposure (not least from Anna’s mother’s gossipy habits). Their connection continued in visits and correspondence until Helmy’s death in Berlin in 1982 (Anna lived a further four years in New York), by which time the story of an Egyptian Arab who risked his life for his Jewish friend had, as Steinke details, become a far more complicated one to tell.

12/26/2021,"There was a moment last year when Boris Johnson was reported to have gone awol (absent without leave) from governing the country in order to work on a book about Shakespeare. At the time, many commentators blamed his absence for a crucial delay in decision-making which contributed to thousands of avoidable, Covid-related deaths. Be that as it may, or was, he returned to the helm of state, brushed off many a criticism, and managed to persuade gullible members of the media and electorate that he possessed Teflon qualities and was invincible.  However, the events of the last month have established, in the poet Robert Browning’s phrase, that it will never be “glad confident morning again” for Johnson. Also, if he has had time, in Cole Porter’s great line, to “brush up” his Shakespeare”, no doubt the words of Claudius will be haunting him: “When sorrows come, they come not single spies / But in battalions.” Yes, it has been one damn thing after another, the climax being the North Shropshire byelection, in which a constituency that had voted 60% in favour of Brexit, and been Tory for donkey’s years, turned against the prime minister who claimed to have “got Brexit done”. The byelection was forced upon the Conservatives because their addiction to “sleaze” had finally caught up with them. Sorry: did I say “Conservatives”? We owe it to a no less respectable figure than Chris – now Lord – Patten, a former chairman of the Conservative and Unionist party, to acknowledge that the present party is more appropriately referred to as the English Nationalist party. But the big issue at the byelection was righteous indignation at the revelation of the government’s blatant hypocrisy last December in flouting its own rules and partying, while most of the populace were obeying the restrictions. In the end, the British public, about whose judgment one sometimes despairs – that Brexit vote! – decides that enough is enough. For British business, long suffering under Johnson’s arrogant attitude – “[expletive deleted] business”, as he is reported to have said in 2018 – enough was enough when the prime minister gave his rambling “Peppa Pig World” address to the annual Confederation of British Industry conference. The CBI speech was in Newcastle, the byelection in Shropshire. At the time, in the interest of switching off from Brexit and Covid in the evenings, I was re-reading the novels of PG Wodehouse. Johnson is often referred to as resembling a character out of Wodehouse, although I suspect that if Wodehouse were still with us, he would not give Johnson the time of day. The Lord Emsworth novels are set in Shropshire; but Blandings Castle – modelled, I think, on Weston Park – is in southern Shropshire. Nevertheless, I think Johnson made a mistake in drawing attention to pigs in his CBI speech. The pig industry, and much of English farming, is in a bad way as a consequence of Brexit, and I suspect that their travails also played a role in the angry vote in North Shropshire, which is a rural constituency. In one Wodehouse novel, Lord Emsworth’s prize pig, the Empress of Blandings, goes off her food, but finally yields to an American pig farmer’s magic cry: “Pig-hoo-o-o-o-ey!” The American word “hooey”, not in popular use these days, means nonsense or rubbish. It deserves a revival. It epitomises much of what Johnson’s English Nationalist party stands for. But back to the battalions: out goes Brexit “negotiator” Lord Frost; in comes Brexit negotiator Liz Truss. What do Johnson, Frost and Truss have in common? They are all living practitioners of Groucho Marx’s great pronouncement: “These are my principles, and if you don’t like them … well, I have others.” We know that both Johnson and Frost are on record before the Brexit referendum as being well aware that, as members of the EU, we had the best of both worlds: we were members of a great trading bloc, and enjoyed the equivalent of a “get out of jail free” card for most of the things we didn’t want. But what of Truss? It has been widely reported that she, too, used to be a Remainer, but seized the main chance of elevation by becoming a Brexiter. However, we owe it to that great student of all things European, my old friend Charles Grant, to discover that all is not what it seems with the Rt Hon Truss. Grant has known her a long time. In an article for the Centre for European Reform thinktank, of which he is director, he reveals that, before converting to the Remain cause for Cameron’s referendum, Truss was a Eurosceptic. She gets about in the course of her career, she does.",News/Business,Johnson’s pig-headed reign approaches its tragicomic climax ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/26/johnsons-pig-headed-reign-approaches-its-tragicomic-climax
12/26/2021,"Once again, Britain is experiencing a festive season hit by waves of Covid-19 infections. Last year, Christmas and New Year were spoiled by the appearance of the Alpha variant. This time, it is Omicron that has sent case numbers soaring. Christmas cancellations have swept through Britain’s restaurants, pubs and clubs and left the country on the brink of another bleak New Year as the NHS warns once more that it is facing the threat of being overwhelmed by spiralling numbers of seriously ill patients. The scenario has raised fears that this now represents the shape of Christmases to come. Social restrictions and lockdown threats could become our normal festive fare.  It is a dispiriting prospect. But is it realistic? Are we justified in drawing close parallels between this Christmas and last year’s? These are key questions because, in trying to answer them, we may also find clues to the likely path of the entire pandemic. At first glance, the two years look striking similar, with case numbers rocketing in only a few weeks in the UK. However, hospitalisations and deaths from Covid-19 remain very low so far this year, with latest research suggesting that the new variant appears to trigger fewer cases of severe illness than its viral predecessors. Scientists have generally treated these results studies as good news but have also counselled caution. Daily Covid-19 case numbers are still rising – they reached a record 122,000 on Friday – and it was estimated that 1.7m people had Covid-19 in the UK last week. Crucially, most of the new cases have occurred in young adults, which has led some researchers to warn that if Omicron starts to affect older – more vulnerable – people in greater numbers, hospitalisations could still jump. On the other hand, a huge number of people – especially the elderly – have now been give vaccines and boosters and will have gained considerable protection against Omicron. It remains to be seen how these different factors affect figures. At present, data is still being gathered and it is too early to be sure. At the same time, policy decisions to protect public health still have to be taken. The problem is highlighted by infectious disease epidemiologist Professor Mark Woolhouse of Edinburgh University. “There is inevitably a lag between infection and hospitalisation,” he told the journal Nature last week. “But in the meantime, policy decisions have to be made, and that is not straightforward.” Many scientists believe evidence is now suggesting that this idea may be correct. Recent studies in Scotland, England and South Africa all point in this direction. “My gut feeling is that this variant is the first step in a process by which the virus adapts to the human population to produce more benign symptoms,” says Dr Julian Tang, Professor of Respiratory Sciences at Leicester University. “In a sense, it is to the virus’s advantage if it affects people in a way that that they don’t get too sick – because then they can walk around and mingle in society and spread the virus even more.” Some health officials have predicted that Covid-19 could end up behaving like influenza, which requires a new vaccine to deal with new strains that appear every year. However, Professor Martin Hibberd, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, argues that coronaviruses – like those that already cause common colds – do not behave this way: “They do not appear as new strains every year. The reason we get colds in winter is because our immunity to coronaviruses does not last very long. And this virus seems to be more similar to those that cause common colds. In other words, we may still need to think about giving vaccines to protect against Covid-19 every year because immunity will always slip.” That does not mean we face “doom and gloom” for the next five years, adds Tang. “I think the virus will evolve itself out of the pandemic strain very soon and become milder, more transmissible to the point where you may only need to think about vaccinating the more vulnerable members of the population.”",News/World news,Omicron: bleak New Year or beginning of the end for the pandemic?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/26/omicron-bleak-new-year-or-beginning-of-the-end-for-the-pandemic
12/26/2021,"And so that was Christmas. I hope you had fun. Near and dear ones, old and young, all the good stuff. Presents, tree, giant fowl… a dusting of carols, a soupcon of the Queen… a joyous surrender to couch-based inertia and sprout-based flatulence. If this isn’t the time to indulge a few cliches, I don’t know what is. My family has always indulged pretty much every one of its yuletide whims, turning the 72 hours from Christmas Eve to Boxing Day into a rare bacchanal of M&S excess that I embrace, endorse and would defend to the death on the barricades. There is only ever one wrinkle in the wrapping paper, which is that I’m still single at 43 and nothing brings that home like the most family-oriented festival of the year.  For one thing, the TV schedulers do seem to have a unified if blinkered view of what constitutes an appropriate Christmas message for never-married women like me. I’ve watched enough Hallmark movies now to have learned that the reason for my ongoing lack of a partner is the fact that I’m simply too uptight and wedded to my job and that if I would only move back home to the small town where my parents’ grocery store is under threat, I’d soon run into a passionate beet farmer who could teach me the true meaning of the season. So while I rarely regret my singleness, a rich diet of festive romcoms does tend to bring on an annual purging of forlorn hope, the same way the water companies like to discharge their sewage overflows into the sea when they think no one is looking. After all, these are not the most dignified of times for the unpartnered person. You try feeling great about yourself after you’ve spent a sleepless night sharing a room with your excitable five-year-old niece or gradually deflating on the airbed wedged in the alcove next to your brother-in-law’s treadmill. Thank the blessed baby Jesus, then, for Betwixtmas, which begins, according to my calendar at least, on 27 December. This special four-day period is nestled between the messy aftermath and clean-up duties of family Christmas and the exhausting-sounding New Year’s Eve party I will almost certainly flake out of at the last minute. It is truly the single person’s holiday. For while married friends and knackered parents are on field manoeuvres in a car crowded with over-entitled children and over-ripe cheese, zigzagging between grandparents, in-laws and friends they’re too busy to see the rest of the year, the single person is in their pyjamas eating leftover trifle for lunch and making a last-minute plan with their other single friends to see the new Matrix film. As with any epiphany, the magic of Betwixtmas did not immediately appear to me and my pals. In our 20s, it was a wilderness zone, when everyone had taken time off work and headed home to see their folks, with whom they would grow increasingly impatient and irritated, building up a head of frustration and emotion that had to be released in an epic all-night blow-out on New Year’s Eve. But we were young and the fear of being home alone without concrete plans was still upon us. It was only in our 30s that we began to discover the secret weapon of which we were possessed. If there is one superpower that the single person wields, one gift the gods have reserved uniquely for us, it is that of spontaneity. While our contemporaries require a good week’s notice to find enough childcare cover for a quick coffee, we who have so much time to ourselves usually have plenty left over to share with others. For that very reason, some of my most cherished festive memories have been laid down in the unhallowed, under-celebrated days of Betwixtmas, days with mundane names such as Monday or Tuesday or that-day-I’ve-got-off-in-the-middle-of-the-week. A holy time of quiet reflection, punctuated with long walks with whoever’s around or sneaky sales shopping in self-extended lunch hours. Of easygoing leisure interrupted with a sudden dash to a discount-ticket matinee or an outing to an ice rink where you spend five minutes in skates and two hours drinking rum-laced hot chocolate under an outdoor heater. Yes, many of these are days when some of us are technically supposed to be working. But first, we all know no one’s keeping tabs. Second, if Heather says she’s going to be in the pub that lies exactly halfway between our houses then surely it would be impolite not to join her? And third, the randomness of people’s availability is half the joy. There’s an element of open-house fluidity to Betwixtmas; it extends its joyful invitation to anyone with a few hours to spare during this unstructured interregnum. Which is how I’ve ended up spending some gloriously meandering days with a truly random assortment of friends and friends’ friends who would never otherwise have been in each other’s company. This, to me, is when the festive season offers its most exclusive gift. These are the moments when I feel like I’m living my true Christmas movie-self: making lightning costume changes, from a onesie to a party dress and back again. You need confidence in yourself to enjoy it. You have to be prepared to embrace uncertainty. Of course, in-person social activities will be curtailed this year; it is incumbent on those of us who love this sacred time to honour it responsibly. Some of the meet-ups will move to Zoom, some of the movie nights will be Netflix watch-alongs, but its spirit will live on among single people everywhere. So from my “family” to yours, we wish you all a very merry Betwixtmas. Emma John’s book, Self Contained: Scenes From a Single Life, is out now",Opinion/Opinion,"Families have had their fun.

12/26/2021,"Cinderella may not be going to the ball any more but people are bringing the glamour to their own front rooms for this New Year’s Eve. Much like the rise of the makeshift “kitchen disco”, which brought the dancefloor to your home during last year’s lockdown, “Hogmanay at home” looks, such as “tinsel hair”, are having a moment despite mass celebrations being called off.  “With the recent news putting the fear back into us all, daily mood boosters, like doing our hair, will be key to keeping morale up,” says hairdresser and colourist Lisa Shepherd. Tinsel hair, in which people coat strands of their hair with silver pieces of tinsel, also feeds into fashion trends from the late 90s and early 2000s such as low-rise jeans and Croc shoes, which are back in vogue. “The 00s are having a huge impact on hair trends; we’re seeing so many buns with spiky ends and butterfly clips are everywhere,” says Rachael Gibson, hairstyle historian. “The original Y2K trends were very much about the birth of digital culture, and now we live entirely online it makes sense that those trends are being revived.” Tinsel hair, recently sported by singer Katy Perry to mark her Las Vegas singing residency, is also about the revival of certain hair accessories. “Tinsel hair first appeared in the early 00s when the hair extensions market exploded,” says Gibson. “As well as seeing wider availability of extensions for typical services like length and volume, we started seeing options for more fun, fashion looks, like vibrant colour as well as things like feathers and tinsel.” Gibson draws a historical line from tinsel hair to glitter hair sprays in the 1980s, and all the way back to ancient Romans using gold dust in their hair. The style, thanks to its immediate visual impact, currently has 19 million views on TikTok. Hana Ben-Shabat, author of Gen Z 360: Preparing For The Inevitable Change In Culture, thinks that younger people are wearing styles rooted in the past out of a desire to escape their current circumstances. “I believe that they revert to the past, not out of single-minded nostalgia but as a means to escape and find comfort and inspiration at a time that the world around them is overwhelmingly confusing and challenging,” she says. More practically, Gibson thinks that tinsel hair works because of its immediacy and affordability. “The trend was born for social media – it’s colourful, it’s sparkly and it’s a bit different. All factors that work really well to launch a trend,” she says. “After the last couple of years, people are looking for statements of optimism and fun, and there’s not much more fun than glitter hair.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,Back to Y2K with the new glitter hair party look,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/dec/26/back-to-y2k-with-the-new-glitter-hair-party-look
12/26/2021,"Right through history – be it during war times or a downturn in economic stability – red lipstick has always been used as a way to lift one’s spirit and countenance. So for those who are yet to discover the magic of a red lipstick, now is as good a time as any. “Everyone has a red,” they say. Trite but actually, more than ever, it is true. Broadly speaking, the key finishes are creamy, shiny and (my personal favourite) matte. Mattes of old have (justifiably) gained a reputation for being brilliant for colour payoff but so drying they turn your lips to sandpaper. The new formulations, however, are much more sophisticated than their predecessors, so you can expect a deep, rich long-lasting pigment that doesn’t compromise on comfort. The breadth of tones available is also impressive. The red lipstick is, contrary to popular belief, not monolithic. You can get a bluey red, said to be pretty universal (Byredo is a good example of this); a brownish red (Lisa Eldridge’s Cinnabar, Mac’s Viva Glam 1); an orangey red (Confidence by Kjaer Weis); a pinky red (Valentino’s Spike Red)… essentially there is something for everyone. You just need to try them and see what clicks. That said, if the idea of an opaque red still feels like too big a step, try Violette FR’s Bisou Balm.

12/26/2021,"Italians have been enjoying an unusual period of political harmony – Mario Draghi, the prime minister, brought decisive, competent leadership in the midst of the pandemic, and the economy is growing fast. But that could be thrown into jeopardy when parliament elects a new president in January. An opaque ritual described as being akin to the appointment of a new pope, the topic is dominating the political debate as the outcome could leave Italy with a predicament at a critical juncture: should Draghi, the former European Central Bank chief credited with restoring stability and confidence in the country, remain prime minister, or become president?  There are no official candidates in Italy’s presidential elections. Instead, lawmakers cast secret ballots for the seven-year mandate – they can vote for anyone, so long as they are an Italian citizen and aged 50 or over. Names that have cropped up in previous elections have included footballer Francesco Totti, actor Sophia Loren, and even porn star Rocco Siffredi. Voting can drag on for several rounds before a winner emerges. Draghi has been regularly floated as the frontrunner to succeed Sergio Mattarella, who steps down as head of state on 3 February. The 74-year-old hinted last week that he might be readying for the role. At his end-of-year press conference, he responded to questions about his future, saying: “My personal destiny is of no importance. I have no particular ambitions. I am, if you like, a grandfather in the service of the institutions.” The only person who is explicitly pursuing the role, according to the Italian media, is the scandal-tainted former prime minister and leader of Forza Italia, Silvio Berlusconi. “It’s extremely unlikely that he’ll get elected but we shouldn’t rule it out,” said Wolfango Piccoli, co-president of the London-based research company, Teneo. “If there is one person who has unparalleled vote-buying skills, it’s Berlusconi.” Italy’s president is largely a ceremonial role, albeit with the power to resolve political crises, pick prime ministers and call early elections. Mattarella was forced to step in several times to resolve crises, including calling on Draghi to form a unity government in February after the administration led by Giuseppe Conte collapsed. The timing of the election is delicate. Draghi is considered a safe pair of hands but a move to the presidential palace would bring his government to an early end, undermining efforts to enact the reforms needed to secure instalments from the EU’s post-pandemic recovery fund, of which Italy is the biggest beneficiary. “It’s the first time that this election has been economically relevant,” said Piccoli. “The country lost 10% of GDP because of the pandemic, and now, with Draghi, there is this new confidence… the question is whether this can last beyond the presidential election.” In the worst-case scenario, Draghi’s promotion could bring the general election forward by a year. If early elections are held, polls consistently indicate that a coalition of the far-right parties, the League and Brothers of Italy, and Berlusconi’s Forza Italia, could win. Voting is expected to begin in the third week of January, but only on three occasions has a new president emerged in the first round. “There will be back-door deals, lots of posturing and random names mentioned every other day,” said Piccoli. “But, historically, all the names mentioned in the lead-up to the vote are there to get burnt. I would be surprised if anyone mentioned so far is the real deal, with the exception of Draghi.” Other names bandied about in the media include the current justice minister Marta Cartabia, the former prime minister Romano Prodi, another former prime minister and current European commissioner for the economy, Paolo Gentiloni, and Gianni Letta, a long-time adviser to Berlusconi. If Draghi does stand, he might bide his time until the second or third round. “Even for someone like Draghi it’s not a given that he can get elected in the first round, and so he wouldn’t want to undermine his standing by putting himself up for the job too early,” said Piccoli.",News/World news,Italians fear return of instability if Mario Draghi quits to become president,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/26/italians-fear-return-of-instability-if-mario-draghi-quits-to-become-president
12/26/2021,"If there is one image from the past year that is certain to make the history books, it is that indelible picture from April of the Queen, Covid-masked and isolated, in a wooden pew of St George’s chapel, Windsor, for the funeral of her husband, Prince Philip. As yesterday’s heartfelt Christmas message confirmed, the monarch, frail though resolute, still consumed by duty, has, as she enters the 70th year of her long reign, never felt so alone. You might argue that, at the end of a torrid year, her nation also finds itself as isolated as at any time during those seven decades. Twelve months on from the Brexit agreement that saw the not-very United Kingdom bid adieu to its nearest neighbours, many more of the fears of Remainers than the hopes of Leavers have begun to be realised. Though the economic evidence has been blurred by the pandemic, it’s already clear enough that departure from the single market has created dramatic and predictable labour shortages and severely disrupted supply chains. Far from the promised ease of “sovereignty”, Britain has in the past year become a country ever more hemmed in and obsessed by its borders, locked into intractable negotiation over the Irish Sea, mired in bureaucracy at the Channel ports, fixated on hostile responses to desperate refugees in rubber dinghies and currently shut out from any free movement to the continent because, as if we didn’t know before, borders have two sides.  The roots of that isolation lie in the disease of British – or English – exceptionalism, which brought this government to power. It is that ideology, in which rules are for other people, which also set the stage for the reckless and chaotic initial response to the pandemic and which has defined the judgment of the prime minister right up to the present moment. To say the government he leads has “trust issues” is like suggesting that a kleptomaniac enjoys a shopping trip. That peerless chronicler of her times, Joan Didion, who died on Thursday at the age of 87, once observed (of the moribund and corrupt Reagan administration of 1988) that “most strikingly of all, it was clear that those inside the process had congealed into a permanent political class, the defining characteristic of which was its readiness to abandon those not inside the process”. Looking back over the events of the past year or longer, it is equally hard to understand the actions of Johnson’s government in any other way. One heartening consequence of that transparent venality and laziness, however, has been the determination of the majority of the population to act with greater fellow feeling than their rulers in Westminster. The spirit of localism that had its vivid expressions in Marcus Rashford’s campaign to feed hungry children at the start of the pandemic, and which saw communities pull together to make provision for the vulnerable, has persisted in different ways as the crisis has dragged on. You could see it in the widespread acceptance that, in the absence of clear guidance, this would have to be once again, a restrained festive period. Despite the vocal minority of anti-vaxxers on the streets, and the highly selective “libertarians” dictating government dithering from the back benches, most people have been at pains to do the right thing. We are approaching the new year with understaffed emergency wards filling up and a depressingly familiar sense of uncertainty about the exact scale and nature of the challenges ahead. As Didion also observed: “It is easy to see the beginnings of things and harder to see the ends.” If the past year has revealed anything, however, it is, once and for all, that complex crises cannot be solved by populist slogans; they require rigour and competence and sacrifice, qualities, as we move into 2022, still far more in evidence in Britain’s people than its leaders.",Opinion/Opinion,The Observer view on a year in which the British public put their leaders to shame,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/26/the-observer-view-on-a-year-in-which-the-british-public-put-their-leaders-to-shame
12/26/2021,"The recent barrage of threats from Vladimir Putin is no longer solely to do with Ukraine. Russia’s president has steadily broadened the scope of his demands to encompass defence and security arrangements in Europe as a whole. Even if current tensions on Ukraine’s borders do not ultimately result in open conflict, this deliberate escalation bodes ill for 2022. What Putin wants, in effect, is to turn the clock back to the 1990s, before former Warsaw Pact countries such as Poland and ex-Soviet republics such as Estonia joined Nato. If he had his way, he would probably reconstitute the Soviet Union, whose demise he mourns. This bitter old KGB spy never accepted cold war defeat.  The western alliance must make clear that such dangerous revisionism is unacceptable. Russia cannot have a veto on Ukraine’s (or Georgia’s) future Nato membership. Nor may Putin revive the old Soviet “near abroad”, resurrect spheres of influence or dictate where western forces are stationed. Talks on confidence-building measures to ease Russia’s concerns would be a more sensible way forward. Yet by deploying an estimated 100,000 troops to Ukraine’s frontiers and maintaining a verbal bombardment, Putin has made clear he will not quickly relax the pressure on Europe’s leaders. For Washington, this is a geopolitical puzzle. For Europeans, a hostile, angry Russia is an immediate, menacing danger lurking on their doorstep. Sensing US weakness, eastern European countries in particular are alarmed by President Joe Biden’s statement that the US is ready to address “Russia’s concerns relative to Nato” – and by Putin’s aggressive demand last week for “immediate” concessions. The broader worry for 2022 is that, following the chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal, US security guarantees cannot be trusted. Despite assurances at last summer’s G7 summit in Cornwall that “America is back”, Biden is focused primarily on his domestic agenda and on containing China. Neither policy is going well. Covid is surging again, while the president’s signature spending bills, aimed at sparking a post-pandemic recovery, have been watered down or blocked by wayward Democrats in Congress. Biden will be preoccupied by a difficult campaign for November’s midterm elections. Thus for Europe, and the EU in particular, the new year looks set to begin on a disconcertingly uncertain, lonely note. It’s squeezed between a malignant Moscow and an ambivalent America. And to make matters worse, postwar Europe’s foundational relationship – that between France and Germany – may be about to come under fresh strain. Olaf Scholz, Germany’s new chancellor, wasted no time in opening a dialogue with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, travelling to Paris two days after taking office. On paper, the centre-left, three-party coalition led by Scholz backs deeper EU integration and enhanced European sovereignty, ideas promoted by Macron and diluted by Angela Merkel, Scholz’s predecessor. But in practice, French-German convergence may be hard to achieve. There are sharp differences on EU energy policy, the “green transition” and French efforts to classify nuclear energy as a “sustainable” fuel at a time of fast-rising gas prices. Macron wants Germany to support more pan-European spending, funded by shared debt along the precedent-setting lines of the EU’s €800bn (£679bn) Covid recovery fund. This is unpopular in Berlin. Macron argues passionately that, in a world of fierce predators and unreliable friends, Europe must strive for greater autonomy in defence, security and foreign policy. Yet he has opposed calls for a tougher line towards Russia and China from, for example, Annalena Baerbock, co-leader of the German Greens, who is Scholz’s new foreign minister and a keen human rights advocate. It will be hard to square this circle. Europe’s ability to deal with a host of other pressing problems – the row between Brussels, Poland and Hungary over constitutional issues, separatist tensions in the Balkans, friction with Turkey, Islamist terrorism in the Sahel, Iran’s nuclear ambitions and unresolved Brexit arguments – will not be helped by France’s assumption of the six-month EU presidency in January. Although he denies it, Macron is certain to be distracted by his bid for a second term in April’s elections. This epic battle unites three central issues that will dominate Europe’s agenda in 2022: rightwing populism, migration and the pandemic. Some surveys indicate that since the German election, the populist tide has been receding. But in France, strong support for the xenophobic racists, Marine Le Pen and Éric Zemmour, suggests such conclusions are premature. Having followed Biden in abandoning Afghanistan, European Nato members can hardly complain if, as aid agencies predict, they face a big new wave of Afghan refugees this winter. This would again highlight the EU’s collective failure to agree a comprehensive, humane migration policy – and will be exploited by the French far right. Another failure, the extraordinary absence of a coordinated European response to the Omicron variant as countries impose different, contradictory and often deeply unpopular, draconian restrictions, could help tip how France votes. As with Boris Johnson, the Covid bug, not the machinations of Russia, China and the US, may yet be Macron’s and Europe’s undoing.",Opinion/Opinion,The Observer view on the year ahead for Europe | Observer editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/26/observer-view-on-year-ahead-for-europe
