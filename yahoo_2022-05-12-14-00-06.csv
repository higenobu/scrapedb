5/12/2022,"Casey White, the dangerous murder inmate who bolted from an Alabama prison with his jailer, has told detectives that the lovebirds spent most of their time on the run holed up in a cheap Indiana motel and plotting where to go next. Casey White, 38, and Lauderdale County assistant director of corrections Vicky White, 56, were captured on Monday night after a dramatic police chase in Evansville, Indiana, just a five-hour drive from the Florence prison they absconded from 11 days earlier. The pair initially drove 100 miles north through Tennessee where they dumped Vicky’s rust-colored Ford Edge and transferred into a black Ford pickup truck and headed farther north. The truck was spotted on May 3, four days after they escaped, abandoned at a car wash another 200 miles north in Evansville. Surveillance video from the car wash showed Casey White hopping into a grey Cadillac, which a sharp-eyed cop then spotted parked outside Evansville’s Motel 41 on Monday, police said. Cops lay in wait for the pair to leave the motel and when they eventually did on Monday afternoon, a chase began. Vicky White fatally shot herself as cops closed in but Casey White surrendered without incident when their Cadillac crashed, authorities said. While a coroner will have to confirm that she died by suicide, Vicky was found with a gun in her hand. She was also on the phone to 911 mid-chase, saying she had a gun to her head, Vanderburgh County Sheriff Dave Wedding told CNN. Wedding, whose county includes Evansville, seemed incredulous that the fugitives decided to camp out in the small city of 110,000 located along the Ohio River. “After six days [since the car wash sighting] it was just hard to believe that they were here. I wouldn’t think that somebody on the run would stay in a community like Evansville for six days,” he said at a Tuesday morning briefing. Runaway Guard Killed Herself as Cops Chased Her and Inmate He said detectives have since interviewed Casey White, who allegedly told them he planned to get into a shootout with law enforcement but was stymied when the Cadillac hit a grass ditch and was rammed by police. Wedding said White also explained what they had spent their time on the run doing, and what their plan was. “He said he was just trying to find a place to hide out and lay low and they thought they’d driven long enough that they wanted to stop for a while, get their bearings straight, and then figure out the next place to travel,” he said. Wedding said the pair had paid for a 14-day stay at the Motel 41, a $50-a-night joint with unflattering online reviews about bedbugs and moldy walls. “[He] said they were trying to contemplate where they could go and be discretely away from the public eye,” he added. Police display a photo of weapons found after the pair’s capture. Cops found multiple red and blonde wigs the pair used as disguises as well as a stash of guns and $29,000 in cash. They appear to have blown through money as Vicky White reportedly withdrew $90,000 in cash—the proceeds of selling her house—before they escaped. The pair legally purchased the Ford pickup truck but it’s unclear how they obtained the Cadillac, Wedding said. “Their plan was pretty faulty,” Wedding said. “They’re criminals, their plan was faulty and it failed, thank God.” Casey White will be extradited back to Alabama under heavy security at an undisclosed time on Tuesday. In his interview with detectives, he didn’t express any remorse or reveal why Vicky shot herself. While Vicky’s family initially told The Daily Beast that Casey must have “brainwashed” her, Wedding said there were no signs that she had been acting under duress. “He was not forcing her, it was a mutual relationship,” Wedding said.

5/12/2022,"By Daniel Trotta (Reuters) -Wildfire fueled by exceedingly dry brush swept through the wealthy Southern California enclave of Laguna Niguel on Wednesday, destroying about 20 homes while scorching some 200 acres (80 hectares) and forcing evacuations, officials said. No injuries were reported. Though relatively small compared with some other major rural wildfires in western states, the blaze dubbed the Coastal Fire spread rapidly up the steep ridges of the suburban Orange County community with afternoon winds. Video posted on social media showed multimillion-dollar homes consumed with orange flames and billows of black smoke, while neighboring homes appeared untouched. Resident Tim Wheaton said there was only one egress point for many of the affected homes, creating traffic congestion as people tried to evacuate. ""People crying and hugging one another and cars full of I assume their most precious items from their homes,"" Wheaton told Reuters in a Twitter chat, describing the scene. An estimated 20 homes burned, though that number could rise, Brian Fennessy, fire chief of the Orange County Fire Authority, told a news conference. Evacuations were ordered for about 100 homes, the Orange County Sheriff's Department said. As California endures a historic drought exacerbated by climate change, brush that could normally resist fire is consumed with ever greater speed, Fennessy said. ""These fires are taking off and running on us. And they're burning very quickly, not necessarily burning thousands and thousands of acres, but enough that it's burning quickly and into the structures,"" Fennessy said. There were no other major fires in Southern California, enabling firefighters from the area to concentrate resources on Laguna Niguel, the chief said. The hilltop city of about 65,000 people, many of whom enjoy spectacular ocean views, is just inland from the city of Laguna Beach, about 50 miles (80 km) south of Los Angeles.

5/12/2022,"Saudi Oil Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman warned Tuesday that the world is ""running out of energy capacity at all levels."" ""I am a dinosaur, but I have never seen these things,"" he said at a conference. A UAE official also warned that more investment is needed in the energy sector for OPEC+ to deliver sufficient supplies. The amount of unused capacity that the world can tap to produce more energy products is running out, warned top oil ministers. Referring to recent price spikes for refined products, Saudi Oil Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said at a Tuesday conference, ""I am a dinosaur, but I have never seen these things,"" according to Bloomberg. ""The world needs to wake up to an existing reality. The world is running out of energy capacity at all levels,"" he added. Prices for crude oil have surged more than 50% from a year ago to roughly $105 a barrel. But prices for refined products like diesel have soared even higher. In the US, diesel prices are up 78% to $5.50 a gallon, Bloomberg data shows. The United Arab Emirates' oil minister said OPEC+ may not be able to deliver on sufficient energy supplies down the line without more investments. ""We've been warning about the lack of investment,"" Suhail al Mazrouei said in an interview in Abu Dhabi, Bloomberg reported. ""That lack of investment is catching up with a lot of countries."" Mazrouei added that ""politicization"" of the oil market has pushed supply prices higher. Meanwhile, the European Union is weighing a full embargo on Russian oil in an attempt to ramp up economic pressure on Moscow for its war on Ukraine. In the event of the oil ban, one analyst predicted Russia would have to slash its oil production within ""a year or two.""
