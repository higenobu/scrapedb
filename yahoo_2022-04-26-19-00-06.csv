4/26/2022,"STORY: North Korea is set to beef up its nuclear arsenal. That's what leader Kim Jong Un announced as Pyongyang marked the founding anniversary of its military with a massive parade, according to state media. Pyongyang's news agency KCNA said Tuesday the parade featured North Korea's largest known intercontinental ballistic missile, the Hwasong-17, while a state newspaper released images of various weapons being paraded through waving crowds. The Hwasong-17 was test fired for the first time last month, but South Korean officials believe efforts to conduct a full test ended in an explosion over the city of Pyongyang. North Korea has stepped up its weapons tests and displays of military power as denuclearization talks with the U.S. stalled and South Korea prepares to swear in its newly-elected conservative president. U.S. and South Korean officials say there are signs of new construction at North Korea's only known nuclear test site, which has been officially shuttered since 2018, suggesting Pyongyang is set to resume testing nuclear weapons. According to KCNA, Kim said the main mission behind the North's nuclear force is to deter war, but that other uses may apply. North Korea's ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs are banned by the UN Security Council, which has imposed sanctions on the country. During a visit to Seoul last week, the U.S. envoy to North Korea, Sung Kim, said the allies would ""respond responsibly and decisively to provocative behavior"" -- but emphasized his willingness to engage with North Korea ""anywhere without any conditions."" North Korea has said it remains open to diplomacy, but has rejected Washington's overtures as insincere, calling its sanctions and military drills with the South ""hostile policies.""",Politics/Reuters Videos,North Korea flexes new missiles at military parade,https://news.yahoo.com/north-korea-flexes-missiles-military-082308219.html
4/26/2022,"Donald Trump again tried to boast about his intelligence, but at least one member of his family wasn’t buying it. Mary Trump, a niece who has been highly critical of the former president, told MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell on Monday that her uncle is a “black hole of need.” He needs compliments to fill the void and yet he knows people are only telling him what he wants to hear. “And also because he knows it isn’t true,” said Mary Trump, who is a psychologist. “He knows he’s a deeply unintelligent person. He knows that he’s severely damaged and has severe limitations so he’s always trying to fill a need that is unfillable.” Over the weekend, Trump bragged about his intelligence as he explained how he once passed a test designed to detect cognitive decline. He also claimed genius runs in his family. His niece didn’t buy that line of logic, either. “I do find it fascinating that he thinks just because my uncle was a physicist and my grandfather was really good at using federal money to screw working people over that that somehow redounds to Donald’s intelligence,” she said. Mary Trump is the second Trump insider to take issue with his intelligence claims. On Sunday, one-time personal attorney Michael Cohenwondered why the former president once made him warn his alma maters not to release his grades or test scores.

4/26/2022,"It's an old cliché, but an accurate one: disasters are not caused by a single mistake. Several things need to go wrong at the same time to cause a tragedy. That appears to be exactly what happened on Saturday afternoon off the coast of Hokkaido in northern Japan. The Shiretoko Peninsula is a spectacular place. It sticks far out into the northern Pacific, covered in densely forested mountains with waterfalls that cascade off high cliffs straight into the ocean. The northern half of the peninsula is a national park and world heritage site. It is also home to Japan's largest population of Ussuri brown bears, close relatives of the north American grizzly. Apart from the stunning natural beauty, it is the bears that tourists come to see. And the easiest way to see them is by boat. Some companies claim to have a 90-95% success rate in getting their customers a bear sighting. At around 10am on Saturday morning the Kazu 1 tour boat headed out of the little fishing port of Utoro - heading up the peninsula. The boat could hold 65 passengers but on Saturday only 24 tourists were aboard. They had come from all over Japan. There were two small children, one just three years old. The weather was bad. There were strong winds and three-metre (nine-foot) waves. This should have been enough to turn the boat around. As the Kazu 1 headed north into stormy seas, local fishing boats were heading in the other direction, returning to port to take shelter. The skipper of another tour boat says he told the captain of the Kazu 1 it was too dangerous to go out. But he says he was ignored. The captain of the Kazu 1 was inexperienced at skippering at sea. According to Japanese media, he had been trained to operate lake boats but had been hired by the Shiretoko Pleasure Cruise company to replace more experienced skippers who had been ""let go"" by the owner. The company was already under investigation after two previous safety incidents, including a grounding, in 2021. At a little after 1pm on Saturday the coast guard received a distress call. The Kazu 1 was drifting with a broken engine and taking on water close to the Kashuni Falls. This is a particularly rugged piece of the peninsula, with few beaches, and cliffs plunging straight into the sea. In April the water is still very cold, just a few degrees above freezing. You might think that in Japan, where safety is almost a national motto, a passenger boat operating in frigid waters would be required to have life rafts on board. But no. In-shore passenger vessels are not required to have rafts. The Kazu 1 had only life vests and floats for passengers to hold on to. Plunged into the freezing waters off northern Hokkaido in April an average adult would survive no more than an hour, experts say. A child much less. But rescue would not arrive within an hour, or even two. The first coastguard helicopter would not reach the Kashuni Falls until more three hours after the first distress call was received. The north-east coast of Hokkaido is known as a ""blind spot"" for rescue services. The closest helicopter base is 160km (100 miles) away. But on Saturday the closest coastguard chopper was out on another operation. It had to fly back to its base, refuel, and then head north to Shiretoko. By the time it arrived there was only 90 minutes of daylight left. At the time of writing there are 15 passengers and crew still missing. An intense search is continuing. But any hope of finding anyone alive is now pretty much gone. The anger and the soul searching have begun. Important questions need to be answered: Not the least of which is why was an inexperienced skipper allowed to put to sea in treacherous conditions with completely inadequate safety equipment for the freezing waters off northern Japan?",World/BBC,How a Japanese boat trip ended in tragedy,https://news.yahoo.com/japanese-boat-trip-ended-tragedy-002421792.html
4/26/2022,"A family of four in North Carolina reportedly entered the sheriff’s office just hours before being found dead in what authorities say was a murder-suicide. Aschod Ewing-Meeks, 26, entered the Davie County Sheriff’s Office with his girlfriend and two young children on April 18, according to Greensboro Fox affiliate WGHP. Meeks and his girlfriend, Ashton Brown, also 26, then made several calls to authorities over the next two hours until the family was found dead in their burning Junction Road home in Cooleemee. Authorities say Meeks fatally shot Brown and their children before setting fire to the home and turning the gun on himself. “It’s definitely been an impact on the community, on the neighborhood. It’s not an area where we have a lot of calls or issues,” Davie County Sheriff JD Hartman previously said. “The neighbors said they were good neighbors.” Surveillance camera footage from earlier in the day shows the four of them entering the lobby of the sheriff’s office, according to WGHP. Brown can be seen holding the couple’s 8-month-old child, Brixtyn “Brixx” Ewing-Meeks, while 4-year-old Bella Ewing-Meeks stands nearby. Brown stood back as Meeks approached a glass window. “They spoke to our receptionist,” said Sheriff Hartman at a news conference. “They were very vague about what they wanted. They just wanted to talk to an officer.” Meeks asked the receptionist, “You guys have people working here today?” At 12:15 p.m., just four minutes after entering the sheriff’s office, they leave. A series of mysterious phone calls followed when Ashton Brown called authorities 20 minutes later, remaining vague about the reason for the call. “Hi, um, how do you call to speak with a deputy or anything?” Brown asked, saying she wanted to address “a safety reason.” Moments later, a deputy called Brown back, according to the outlet. Brown claimed she was calling on behalf of Meeks before turning the phone over to him. The call only lasted 30 seconds. It wasn’t clear if the call was dropped or someone hung up, but the deputy called back. That call lasted 55 seconds. Another call lasted two minutes. The deputy called back a third time at 12:54 p.m., a call that lasted for six minutes. Two later calls – one at 1:06 p.m. and another at 1:07 p.m. – went straight to voicemail. According to Sheriff Hartman, the deputy spoke only to Meeks after Brown initially contacted authorities. “The rest of the calls were with Mr. Meeks talking,” said Sheriff Hartman. “He wouldn’t really advise what he wanted. He advised the officer that he thought somebody was following him, but he wasn’t in danger. They weren’t threatening him.” Hartman said the conversations took place as Meeks was driving around, unwilling to return to the station or inform the deputy of their whereabouts. Less than an hour later, witnesses saw Brown and Meeks arguing on their front lawn before going inside the house, according to WGHP. Within moments, a passerby noticed smoke coming from the home and alerted authorities at around 2:17 p.m. Members of the Cooleemee Fire Department arrived on the scene just three minutes later. Soon, responders found the bodies of Brown and Brixx in the kitchen and Bella in the doorway of a bedroom. Meeks was found dead on the scene with a gun still in his hand. Although authorities didn’t release how the fire started, they said it was an act of arson. “I’ve seen a lot in 30 years, but children - and especially children that are killed by gunshots and burned - it’s pretty heinous,” said Sheriff Hartman, according to People. “So it’s pretty close to the worst, if not the worst.”",U.S./Oxygen,"Family Entered Sheriff’s Office, Made Vague Phone Calls Leading Up To 'Heinous' Murder-Suicide",https://news.yahoo.com/family-entered-sheriff-office-made-200144785.html
4/26/2022,"CHISINAU (Reuters) -Moldova's president convened an urgent security meeting on Tuesday after two blasts damaged Soviet-era radio masts in the breakaway region of Transdniestria, where authorities said a military unit was also targeted. The Moldovan authorities are sensitive to any sign of growing tensions in Transdniestria, an unrecognised Moscow-backed sliver of land bordering southwestern Ukraine, especially since Russia invaded Ukraine. Russia has had troops permanently based in Transdniestria since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Kyiv fears the region could be used as a launch pad for new attacks on Ukraine. ""In the early morning of April 26, two explosions occurred in the village of Maiac, Grigoriopol district: the first at 6:40 and the second at 7:05,"" Transdniestria's interior ministry said. No residents were hurt, but two radio antennae that broadcast Russian radio were knocked out, it said. Separately, Transdniestria's Security Council reported a ""terrorist attack"" on a military unit near the city of Tiraspol, Russia's TASS news agency reported. It gave no further details. The incidents followed a number of blasts that local television reported on Monday hit Transdniestria's ministry of state security in the regional capital, Tiraspol. Local officials said the building had been fired on by unknown assailants with grenade launchers. Moldovan President Maia Sandu on Tuesday called for a meeting of the country's Supreme Security Council in response to the incidents. ""The Supreme Security Council will meet from 1300 (1000 GMT) at the Presidency. After the meeting, at 1500, President Maia Sandu will hold a press briefing"", the president's press office said in a statement. On Monday, the Moldovan government said the Tiraspol blasts were aimed at creating tensions in a region it had no control of. Last week, a senior Russian military official said the second phase of what Russia calls its ""special military operation"" included a plan to take full control of southern Ukraine and improve its access to Transdniestria.
