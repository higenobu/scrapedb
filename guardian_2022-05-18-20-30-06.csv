5/18/2022,"Health authorities in Spain have issued an alert over a possible outbreak of monkeypox after eight men showed symptoms compatible with the viral infection, which has already been detected in the UK and Portugal. In a statement, the health ministry cautioned that the eight suspected cases – all in the Madrid region – had yet to be confirmed, but said a nationwide alert had been issued “to guarantee a swift, coordinated and timely response”. A spokesperson for Madrid’s regional health department said the eight cases were being analysed by the National Microbiology Centre to obtain a definitive diagnosis. “Generally speaking, monkeypox is spread by respiratory transmission, but the characteristics of the eight suspected cases point towards fluid contact,” the spokesperson said. “The eight suspected cases in Madrid are among men who have sex with men. They are doing well but this illness can require hospital treatment.” Portuguese authorities have confirmed five cases and are investigating another 15 suspected cases. Seven cases have been logged in the UK. The first British case involved a person who had recently been to Nigeria, where they are believed to have contracted the infection before travelling to the UK. According to the UK Health Security Agency, all four of the most recent cases are men who identify as gay or bisexual or other men who have sex with men. The health body is asking these groups “to be alert” to possible symptoms, which include rashes or lesions on any part of their body, especially their genitalia, and to contact a sexual health service if they have concerns. Early symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes and chills. A rash that can look like chickenpox or syphilis can also develop and spread from the face to other parts of the body, including the genitals. Most people recover within a few weeks. A handful of cases of monkeypox, which has two forms and is typically found in central and western Africa, have been diagnosed in the UK in the past. It is thought the seven UK cases involve the west African strain, which is milder than the more severe central African, or Congo, strain.",News/World news,Monkeypox alert in Spain after eight men show symptoms,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/18/monkeypox-alert-spain-men-show-symptoms
5/18/2022,"My older brother, Cecil Poynton, who has died aged 93, was a primary school teacher in Chirk, near Wrexham, and in nearby Pentre, for more than 35 years, mostly teaching pupils in year 6, and charged with preparing them for secondary education. Cecil was born in Chirk, to May (nee Halman), a domestic servant, and Harry Poynton, a miner. The local doctor declared the tiny baby “not viable”, but tender care from the district nurse and parents ensured that he survived – and prospered. Football was the young Cecil’s passion, though austerity made it difficult to acquire both ball and boots. When he did get boots, he wore them to bed. Harry and May were determined that a miner’s life would not be for Cec, and after attending Llangollen county school (now Dinas Bran school), at the age of 17 he went to train as a teacher at Bangor Normal College. After completing his training he was called up by the RAF and served mostly at West Kirby on the Wirral. In 1949 an RAF careers adviser told him there were teaching vacancies at Market Drayton, Shropshire. He worked there for one term and then joined Pentre junior school in 1950, following the death of the headteacher, as acting head. In the early 60s he moved to the larger Chirk primary school as deputy head, teaching year 6 students, which was what he loved doing. He remained at Chirk primary school until retiring in 1988. Cecil was a teacher 24 hours a day, always insisting on the highest standards. And that affected family too: he was a stickler for correct punctuation. When his daughter Helen sent her first letter home from college aged 18, he underlined the grammatical errors and sent it back. Football was a constant throughout his life. In the early 50s, while chaperoning his sisters on a trip to a Butlin’s in north Wales, Cec took part in a football game. Despite not having any boots with him, he played well and was offered a trial at Blackburn Rovers by a scout. However, by then he had started teaching and didn’t want to change careers (at that time, the maximum wage for footballers was £10 a week), so he didn’t take it up. A few years earlier he had been invited for a trial at Manchester United, set up because Cec knew the Man Utd player Billy Meredith and his family. That trial didn’t happen because Old Trafford was still bomb-damaged. A football career was not to be, although Cec continued to play for Chirk AAA, winning the Welsh National League league in 1952. In his retirement, Cec played golf regularly at Vale of Llangollen Golf Club and avidly supported Arsenal FC. He was also a keen and knowledgable gardener. Cec married Elaine Roberts in 1962. She died in 1995. He is survived by their four children, Mark, Catherine, Richard and Helen, and granddaughters, Charlotte, Ellie and Olivia, and by his sister, Brenda, and me.",News/Education,Cecil Poynton obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/18/cecil-poynton-obituary
5/18/2022,"Once the name of this dish is translated – “young peas in the French style” – it has a rather starchy sound to it, when, in fact, it ought to be the opposite. It’s a joyous celebration of spring produce, rendered luxuriant with plenty of butter in a method described as distinctively French by Mrs Acton way back in 1845. Prepared this way, peas, which have become a year-round freezer staple that are tipped from bag to pan to plate without a second thought, are allowed once again to take centre stage; Elizabeth David considers petits pois à la française “a dish, of course, to be served on its own”, though Simon Hopkinson and Lindsey Bareham suggest eating it with triangles of fried bread. I also think it goes rather well with a simply cooked piece of fish, or plain rice. Contentious. The interwar French chef and food writer Xavier Marcel Boulestin is insistent that the peas concerned ought to be “as small as possible”, and David echoes this, claiming that the dish is “only possible … when the youngest, smallest, tenderest garden peas are available”. Hopkinson and Bareham note in The Prawn Cocktail Years that, “curiously, the dish actually turns out better with tinned rather than frozen ones, and you would be surprised to hear how many people love the taste of tinned peas”, before coming down firmly on the side of fresh. Raymond Blanc believes “freshly picked young peas are always the best”, but admits “frozen peas are excellent, too”, while Anne Willan dares to swim against the tide with her bold statement that “you don’t need baby peas, but rather the big fat ones of mid-season”. Though I do make a not inconsiderable investment in two huge bags of fresh pea pods, unless you grow the things yourself (or get them direct from someone who does), it’s impossible to guarantee the size of the seeds inside, or vouch for their age (the sugars in peas begin to convert to starch as soon as they’re picked, so even the tiniest of peas can prove a disappointment in the flavour department if they’ve been in transit for several days). As jarred peas are not readily available here (and also come ready cooked, which is not ideal for our purposes), I would recommend frozen peas as the best substitute for homegrown or similarly spanking-fresh examples. If using frozen peas, I’d second Willan’s recommendation in The Country Cooking of France to use larger peas, often sold as “garden peas”, rather than yer actual petits pois – they’re pleasingly fat and buttery, which works well with the dish as a whole. (I know the name of the dish literally calls for petits pois, but I suspect that particular distinction probably has more to do with young sweet peas versus older, mealy ones, rather than the difference between peas the size of a currant and those the size of a raisin – and if petits pois are what you have, by all means use them instead). Nigella Lawson writes in How to Eat that for this dish, she thaws frozen peas before use, which is sensible, because the cooking method favours the minimum amount of liquid, and defrosting allows you to drain the peas before adding them to the pan. If you don’t have time, though, it’s no big deal. The unsung but, in my opinion, essential supporting actor in this particular production is lettuce – you could make petits pois à la française sans la laitue, but it adds a quite different and delicious texture to the dish, as well as soaking up much of the lovely, buttery liquid. Strangely enough, the great chef Auguste Escoffier reckons wilted lettuce “may not be to everyone’s taste”, while Richard Olney claims in The French Menu Cookbook that, “although the flavour of the lettuce braised with the peas enhances them, serving the lettuce with the peas detracts from their rare delicacy”, and advises removing it before serving. I do not agree, though I do rate Olney’s method of lining the pan with leaves, so the peas are encased and shielded from direct heat. You could shred the rest, as Lawson, Hopkinson and Bareham do, but I enjoy the silkiness of the larger leaves in the recipes that leave them whole. One woman’s silky is another’s slimy, however, so I’ll leave the decision up to you. Older recipes demand green lettuce, while newer ones seem wedded to the sturdier cos or its baby sibling, the little gem. Again, your choice: the ribby cos family will retain some structure and crunch, even after cooking, while softer lettuces, which are my preference here, will wilt down much like spinach. Onions are a must, but it’s wellnigh impossible for most of us to find the small button onions called for in most traditional versions of the dish – red and brown are about the limit in most greengrocers. Standard spring onions are too mild to stand up to such long cooking, so I’ve gone for the more bulbous things sold as “salad onions”; if you can’t find them, use shallots. Bacon is a recent addition to the list of ingredients, and, as Rowley Leigh notes, strictly speaking, this makes the dish petits pois au lard (a seductive name if ever I heard one), but it is one that works very well with peas, onions and butter. I’ve left it out, though, because the dish is perfectly delightful without, but if the idea takes your fancy, fry about 15g diced, unsmoked thick-cut streaky bacon or pancetta per person in two tablespoons of butter until it begins to render its fat, then scoop it out and add to the pan with the peas. Escoffier cooks his peas with a bouquet garni, as does Willan. Hopkinson and Bareham use parsley, Olney tucks some thyme into the lettuce, while Leigh suggests mint, as does Lawson, who sprinkles it on afterwards (“basil is wonderful, too: to me it always smells of summer”). I love the combination of peas and fresh mint, but again, as you wish. Sugar is commonly added, but may not be necessary, depending on the sweetness of your peas. Taste at the end and decide. If you think the type of pea is contentious, wait until you hear how long you have to cook them for. (Moderate) horror greeted a picture I posted online of Olney’s yellowy-green, 45-minute peas, because we’re so used to them looking as vibrantly green and bouncy as the day they were picked. Yet, as nice as blanched petits pois are, to say nothing of raw peas fresh from the pod, there are more ways to prepare a vegetable than al dente, and not everything you eat has to look good on Instagram. Blanc’s recipe, in which the peas are cooked for a mere couple of minutes, is delicious, but the main ingredient remains separate from the sauce, rather than melting into it; David had it right 60 years ago when she wrote in French Provincial Cooking that “the great difference between the way peas are served in French and English cookery respectively is that, while we cook ours so that each pea is, so to speak, separate (and very often a separate bullet), the French cook them so that they are bound together with a sauce, although that sauce usually consists only of butter”. If it makes you feel better, remember that this is a much gentler form of cooking than the rapid boil to which frozen peas are generally subjected. The only liquid should be that from the lettuce and, because I think its acidity greatly enhances the dish, Leigh’s splash of white wine (Lawson suggests chicken stock, which is a good alternative, especially if you’re not using bacon), as well as, of course, a generous amount of butter, reduced, as Willan directs, so it cloaks the peas in a rich, but delicately flavoured sauce. Give me a big bowl of this, a small spoon and perhaps some bread to mop up the juices, and I’m very a happy woman indeed.

Cut the fleshy bits of the green parts into short lengths. (If using shallots, peel, trim and, unless they’re very small, cut in half). Spread half the butter over the base of a medium saucepan, then use the outer leaves of the lettuce to line the pan. Add the peas, onions, half the mint, a good pinch of salt, the remaining butter, diced and spread out among the peas, and the wine. Top with the rest of the lettuce, so the peas are encased. Put the pan on a medium heat and bring its contents to a simmer. Cover, turn down the heat as low as possible and leave to cook very gently for about 30 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally, until the peas are soft and buttery. Scoop out the vegetables into a warm serving dish with a slotted spoon and taste – if you think the sugar is required, add it to the liquid in the pan. Keeping the veg warm, bring the liquid in the pan to a simmer and leave it to bubble awayuntil it’s thickened slightly. Pour over the pea and lettuce mix, scatter over the remaining mint and serve.

5/18/2022,"There is a philosophy class on the Harvard curriculum this semester, under associate professor Emanuele Coccia, called The Ego in Things: Fashion As a Moral Laboratory. The syllabus, which examines the role of fashion in shaping identity and illustrating culture, includes an essay by the late designer Virgil Abloh, and an episode of The Simpsons made in collaboration with Balenciaga, but particular focus is given to Alessandro Michele, the creative director of Gucci. This week Michele, who recently attended the Met Gala twinning with Jared Leto, right down to matching diamante hair barrettes, showed his latest collection, Cosmogonie, at a 13th-century Puglian castle. The influences he cited were not the usual style references – Audrey Hepburn, say, or Cristóbal Balenciaga – but Hannah Arendt, the Holocaust survivor and political theorist who coined the phrase “the banality of evil”, and critical theorist Walter Benjamin.Eight hours before showtime Michele, who is Coccia’s co-author on a forthcoming book about fashion and philosophy, is dressed down in a plaid shirt, loose trousers and sandals, long hair in Pippi Longstocking braids under a Harlem baseball cap. As reporters rustle their notebooks, he snaps open a paper fan, Karl Lagerfeld-style. “To be a fashion designer now is not to be a couturier,” he says. “My job is not to make a rich woman a dress for a gala. My job is to open the door to different points of view, to be in conversation with the moment.” It is heartfelt, although not strictly true. Michele’s job is very much to make dresses for rich women to wear to galas – even if those dresses, like the ones in the show that will be staged later that evening, feature belly button cutouts, or Elizabethan satin ruffs, or are worn with latex thigh-high boots or leopard-print bucket hats. For the Gucci bosses, the motivation behind the extravagantly picturesque setting is in the orders placed by the big spenders in the front row, and the buzz generated around the brand. But for Michele, the setting has a deeper meaning. He is bringing his sequins, lace and pearls to the octagonal towers of the Castel del Monte (which also features on the back of a euro cent coin) – where two stone lions at the entrance face the directions from where the sun rises on the winter and summer solstices – in order to talk about the universe. “I chose this place because it is a stargate between the earth and the sky,” Michele says in his poetic, lilting English. “Fashion is a magical thing, because the power of what we put on our bodies to go out in the world is what makes it mysterious. Without the life we live in them, clothes are just fabric.” A cape with a train of constellations embroidered in shell beads refers to Walter Benjamin’s 1928 observation that “ideas are to objects as constellations are to stars”. For Michele, constellations represent the ability of fashion “to illuminate connections that would otherwise be invisible … When you look at a person’s clothes, you see a connection to their story.” Michele’s delightfully esoteric take on fashion is, as Paris Hilton used to say, so hot right now. Fashion once wanted to be taken seriously as an art. But these days, those who are serious about fashion aspire for it to be a platform for philosophy, activism or debate. With identity politics dominant in culture, clothes are a channel on which heavyweight topics are discussed at street level. From a wartime president’s army-green T-shirts to a judge’s choice of spider brooch, what we wear is a cipher for status updates of all kinds, not just for status. The fashion houses that are setting the pace in the 21st century have each identified themselves with a set of values. Dior, under Maria Grazia Chiuri, its first female designer, has set out to stamp its logo on to feminism. In wardrobing the Kardashian-West divorce and turning a Paris fashion week show into a mirror of the Ukrainian refugee crisis, Balenciaga has laid claim to the provocation and the courting of controversy that, like it or loathe it, looms large. Before his latest diversification into life, the universe and everything, Michele’s Gucci has been primarily about gender and fluidity of identity. From his very first Gucci catwalk show in 2015, in which men wore pussy-bow blouses and pearls, Michele has been poking fun at toxic masculinity. That red carpets now regularly feature men in lace (Harry Styles) or diamonds (A$AP Rocky) and with evening bags (Billy Porter) is due in no small part to the reinvention of Gucci. It has gone from being the home of the leather loafer to the champion of a new male gaze that is permitted to fall lovingly on colour and decoration and glamour, from Donald Glover’s plush caramel velvet tailoring to Ryan Gosling’s floral prom shirts. Happily for Gucci’s bottom line, Michele’s enthusiasm for fluidity chimes with that of young consumers. In his third year at the brand, sales jumped by 42%, although a higher-than-average exposure to the Chinese market has recently taken its toll, as lockdowns continue there. Now, it is showtime. On the steps to the castle, the actor Elle Fanning taps a young man in a varsity jacket on the shoulder, holding out her phone with a smile and a request for a photo with two friends. (The man is actor Paul Mescal, but incognito due to a moustache newly sprouted for a role.) The air turns tinsel silver in the sunset as guests take their seats and the show begins. There are crystals strung from a nose ring to an earlobe, and a dozen ropes of pearls coiled around a throat as thick as a woollen scarf. There are panniered gowns and neon opera gloves and then, as if by magic, a vast blood-red moon, which rises from the horizon, drawing every eye upwards from the clothes to the sky. And for a serendipitous moment, it feels like this really is about more than fashion.",Lifestyle/Fashion,‘This place is a stargate between earth and sky!’: dreaming big with Gucci’s Alessandro Michele,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/may/18/this-place-is-a-stargate-between-earth-and-sky-dreaming-big-with-guccis-alessandro-michele

5/18/2022,"If you watch any current affairs programme for long enough, eventually you’ll come across a sinister enemy that is intent on attacking fish and chip shops, taking away the nation’s books, and corrupting your children. This terrible coterie has become known as the “wokemob”. The “wokemob” is becoming an increasingly dominant part of British political discourse in the 2020s. Tony Blair recently made yet another rare political intervention to urge Keir Starmer to drop “woke” politics (when asked what policies should be focused on instead, Blair said that Starmer should introduce biometric ID cards). Just yesterday, I appeared on BBC Politics Live alongside the self-appointed leader of an “anti-woke collective”, Laurence Fox, who described “wokery” as disgusting. The challenge for progressives, and progressive political parties, is to avoid the trap of endless debates with the right about wokeness, while also defending progressive values. To that end, at the Centre for Labour and Social Studies (Class), we have undertaken a year-long project called the UK Race Class Narrative project, officially launching tomorrow. It examined this “anti-woke” story and its purpose, and uncovered a new way of talking about British society that can unite people around their shared material interests, rather than dividing them. We found that the divisive story about the wokemob had mainly been constructed by a small handful of people, consisting of certain politicians, parts of the media and very privileged public figures. It is mainly coming from the hard right of the political spectrum and key figures in the government and media, but elements of the centre and the left have started experimenting with it as well. Many adherents of the anti-woke story genuinely believe it, but it also provides them with a useful distraction technique. In the face of pressing issues such as the cost of living scandal or government corruption, the anti-woke story is usually dispensed to convince people that the biggest threat facing the UK is the nebulous wokemob and not, say, energy companies making vast profits at people’s expense, or the government’s disastrous handling of the pandemic. Four days before the charity Action for Children announced that children were getting chilblains because their parents couldn’t afford to heat their homes, the Telegraph published an article arguing that “woke is not just an insult – it’s a threat to our freedom”. Race plays a key role in how the narrative of the wokemob works. Its proponents largely avoid attacking minority groups directly. Instead, the focus of their outrage are the advocates of racial justice. This is an extremely broad group of people: everyone from the National Trust to Black Lives Matter, Disney to academics, the Labour party to the England football team have all been pejoratively described as woke at some point, simply because they have acknowledged the existence of racism (particularly structural or historical racism) and they have concluded that it is a bad thing. Indeed, it should tell us something about the “anti-woke” story that the word “woke” is believed to have been coined by Black Americans in the mid-20th century, who used it to describe the process of becoming sensitised to issues of racial justice. The wokemob, argues the modern story, is hellbent on lavishing minorities and immigrants with undeserved privileges at the expense of the white working class (sometimes described using more euphemistic terminology like the “authentic” or “traditional” working class). This is clever on the part of the people promoting this anti-woke story, because they are essentially telling us that equality is a zero-sum game in which white people lose out when advancements in racial justice are made. In their story, people of colour, recent immigrants and their “woke allies” are pitted against the white working class, their “traditional British values” and people like Boris Johnson, who implies that only his government has the genuine interests of the working class at heart. Thus, every time anyone uses the term culture war, the idea that two sides are at war over a clash of values is reinforced. Faced with such a vivid and emotive story, the response of the people on my side of the political spectrum – the progressive side – has been a kind of paralysis. Unsure of what to say and afraid of being labelled woke ourselves, progressives oscillate between repeating damaging elements of the anti-woke story (by repeating our opponents’ phrases, such as cancel culture) or simply denouncing the anti-woke narrative as racist (which it is). The underlying problem is that we are yet to create our own competing story about society, the country in which we live, and our shared values and needs. Perhaps we have also confused the sheer dominance of the anti-woke story in the mediasphere with cachet among the public, overlooking the fact that most people have not made up their minds about key political issues, and most care about their communities and want to be kind – qualities that should mean that most people are at least in theory receptive to progressive politics. Recent polling suggested that nearly a third of people don’t even know what woke means. It’s time for progressives to bite the bullet and start telling a story of our own. Our UK Race Class Narrative project uncovered new ways of communicating that bring people together around their shared material interests, and actually outperform the divisive anti-woke story in empirical testing. Far more effective than focusing on problems, denouncing the right or listing policies is opening with shared progressive values (like the importance of a good quality of life and building a better world for our children), being clear about exactly who is getting in the way of those values being realised and why, and emphasising that by joining together across our differences we can make life better for all of us, whatever our race. But there is another thing we discovered in the course of our research. We used hundreds of sources to create a summation of the anti-woke story and a summation of the current progressive response to it, and showed both to participants to gauge their response. The anti-woke story decisively won. In fact, one in three people who took part in our research couldn’t even remember what the progressive response was immediately after hearing it, let alone decide whether they liked it. Progressives sometimes like to see ourselves as too evidence-driven and honourable to get into the dirty business of emotive politics. But the truth is we’re not above this issue: we’re asleep at the wheel as our opponents paint us as the enemy. It’s time to change course, and fast, because if we don’t we might one day find ourselves steered into an all-consuming reactionary society, as the socially liberal and unified future we’d hoped for recedes into the distance.

To receive the full version once a week, just pop your email in below: Anyone who has struggled with mental health will know how difficult it is to take that first step. Whether it’s a lack of confidence, anxiety or something else, opening up is a daunting prospect. But, when you do, it is also the most rewarding, enabling you to perform at your best. For an elite footballer, self-confidence is key. It is often said that a happy footballer makes a successful one and it is important for players to be able to thrive. This was the reason Lisa Naalsund, the Brann and Norway midfielder, jumped at the offer of support in 2019. Having progressed through Norway’s youth system, she started to realise something was wrong. Feeling her mental boundaries were inhibiting her performances on the pitch she sought help from a performance coach. “I felt like I was really shy and insecure as a person,” she reflects, “not as a football player because that was the one thing I was good at. I felt like my personality was getting in the way of me performing at my best.” Her support came from a familiar face. Her strength coach was looking to train in mental health education and needed athletes to practise on. For Naalsund, the timing was perfect. Within a year of making that first step, she could see the difference both in herself and on the pitch: “I feel like I have become more mature, and I have become more like me. I’m not afraid of being me. So that gives me confidence that helps on the field or in the games and practice because I don’t care what others say so it’s a good place to be.” The rewards are clear to see. It has been a whirlwind 12 months for the Bergen native. She played an integral role in the run that led SK Brann – then called Sandviken – to the 2021 Toppserien title, earning high praise from her manager, Alexander Straus. The respect is clearly mutual: “I think it’s as important that the coach is a good coach. [Someone] who can also be good at sports but also with the people on the team … it’s good to have a coach who wants your best and wants you to be the best.” Domestic success has prompted the national team to come calling and Naalsund finally made her debut against Sweden last summer. “It was really fun,” she remembers. “I have been waiting a long time and I felt like last year was a breakthrough for me on the national team, because I felt like the time was right.” Once again, the timing is everything. Now with five caps to her name, she is hoping to take part in the European Championships this summer. Brimming with talent, Norway are one of the dark horses in the tournament, something she is embracing: “We’re kind of the underdogs. We’re hoping that we can do well and play good matches against the best teams and maybe we can fight our way to a quarter-final. [We will] take each game as it is and then see how far we go.” Armed with the tools to succeed, the future is exciting. Naalsund dreams of winning another title with Brann, success at the Euros and qualifying for the Champions League. Seeing the rewards from the help she has received, she is adamant that every player should have access to mental health support: “It’s really important. I think everyone should get some help. Even if you don’t feel like you need it, you probably do … I think it’s a little weird that it’s not more common in every team to have people hired to help the players.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

5/18/2022,"Manchester City could try to sign Brighton’s Marc Cucurella this summer as they attempt to solve their issues at left-back. The Spaniard has enjoyed an impressive debut campaign at Brighton and has emerged as a key target for Pep Guardiola. Cucurella’s dynamic performances for Graham Potter’s side have caught the City manager’s attention and an offer of £35m could land him.Brighton stand to make a sizeable profit if they sell Cucurella, who left Getafe for £15.4m. The the 23-year-old has quickly become a favourite at the Amex Stadium and wept tears of joy after scoring his first goal for Brighton in their 4-0 win over Manchester United last month. Guardiola would love to have a player of Cucurella’s quality. Left-back has been a problem position for City this season, when they have predominantly used Oleksandr Zinchenko and João Cancelo there. Zinchenko struggled to contain Jarrod Bowen when City drew 2-2 with West Ham last Sunday and Cancelo, who has had a strong campaign, is right-footed. Cucurella would give Guardiola’s team more balance. He is strong defensively and accomplished on the ball. He loves to get forward, crosses well and can play in a more advanced role, so it is unlikely that he would struggle to adapt to City’s style. City have strengthened their attack by agreeing to sign Erling Haaland from Borussia Dortmund. They could also be in the market for a central midfielder because Fernandinho is set to end his time in Manchester and Ilkay Gündogan is reportedly looking to leave.",Sport/Football,Manchester City make Brighton left-back Marc Cucurella a summer target,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/18/manchester-city-make-brighton-left-back-marc-cucurella-a-summer-transfer-target-guardiola
5/18/2022,"Were a trend expert to examine the fortnight’s big gig listings, they might be forgiven for assuming that we’re in the midst of a 2002 revival. My Chemical Romance are back and playing vast outdoor gigs, David Gray is doing White Ladder in full, and the Killers are warming up for a stadium run with this relatively intimate Sheffield show. Music has changed so much since we first met, but when you’ve got a pocketful of hits and a roomful of nostalgic millennials clamouring to hear them, what’s a few years between friends? The Killers’ touring lineup has been tweaked significantly over the years, but singer Brandon Flowers is still the consummate Vegas showman. Leg almost permanently cocked on a speaker, he punches the air and points his fingers with the pomp of an Elvis impersonator, conducting the masses. “Sing me a lullaby!”, he roars playfully on When You Were Young as it hurtles headlong into its formidable guitar solo. It’s a bold opener, but as the show continues, his megawatt grin is not the only thing that the venue’s low ceiling is struggling to contain. Rarely hosting a band of this bombast, the PA groans, coating the slower album cuts in a heavy sludge. Luckily, we’re rarely more than three songs away from a slice of heaven from debut Hot Fuss. The life that Mr Brightside has taken on in the UK is the stuff of lore, and when it drops mid-set, the bellowed chants that greet it quickly overwhelms any criticism of the speaker system. In such a clammy room, it’s almost punishing to immediately follow it with Somebody Told Me, but it’s an indulgent thrill that this audience of superfans earns. Before a touching rendition of A Dustland Fairytale, Flowers praises the UK as their “spiritual home … I hope you can hear that we’re genuine when we talk about how much we love it here”. It is a sentiment repeated by drummer Ronnie Vannucci at the show’s end, climbing down from his kit to humbly thank us for supporting something that to them has always been “far more than a job”. Tonight’s cage might not have been as grand as the Killers are used to, but with 20 years of practice and the crowd on their side, they’re still coming out of it with style.  The Killers are at Eco-Power Stadium, Doncaster, on 24 May, then tour the UK until 11 June.",Arts/Music,The Killers review – Brandon Flowers thrills intimate venue with Vegas showman swagger,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/18/the-killers-review-o2-academy-sheffield
5/18/2022,"One of the biggest advantages you can have in life is the superpower of “getting away with shit”. If you manage to play by different rules from the people you’re competing against, you can appear unstoppable. If you’re good enough at it, you can reveal that even deeply foundational rules of the system are, in practice, just guidelines, a gentleman’s agreement, or just politeness. The rise of Donald Trump in US politics, for instance, led to half a decade of commentators insisting he couldn’t do things that he, in fact, could and did do. (Depending on how you interact with politics, I can direct you to this comment piece or this viral tweet for an elaboration of that argument.) Tech news this week has been dominated by two things: Elon Musk’s will-he-won’t-he game with Twitter, and the collateral damage across the crypto sector of the collapse of the stablecoin TerraUSD. But really, it’s been dominated by one thing: the incredible power of getting away with shit. --- Elon Musk’s long history of acting with impunity is well documented, in part because so much of what he’s got away with directly involves the social network he’s currently (maybe) buying. There was the time he called a British cave diver a “pedo guy”, tweeted that if he wasn’t a paedophile he would sue, sent material suggesting he was a paedophile to a reporter, and then won in court based on the argument that he hadn’t intended to imply he was really a paedophile, and said sorry anyway. There was the time he tweeted that he would be taking Tesla private at a valuation of $420 dollars a share (he didn’t) and that he had funding secured (he hadn’t). And there was the time he bought a five per cent stake in a publicly traded company, failed to disclose the stake when he was legally required to, saved $143m as he continued to build up his stake in secret, eventually disclosed his stake and committed to being a passive investor, immediately started pushing for changes to the company’s product, accepted a seat on the board and admitted he was an activist investor, then rejected the seat on the board and launched a takeover bid for the company. And we’re up to the present day. Some may dispute that Musk has in fact got away with all that. Yes, he won in court against Vernon Unsworth, the British diver; but he was slapped with a fine by the SEC for his “funding secured” tweets, and is under investigation by the regulator for his missing disclosures over the Twitter purchase (for that, in case you weren’t paying attention, was the public company). But the odds are slim that Musk ends up paying a fine even close to the $143m he saved delaying his Twitter disclosure; and as for the SEC oversight following his bad tweets, well, take a look at his tweets since then to see quite how much the regulator is encouraging him to constrain himself. Despite that history, a lot of people seem to be under the impression that Musk is playing the same game as his other public company chief executive peers. He is not. Even when CEOs don’t follow the letter of the law, they have a tendency to act like they know they should: they don’t just … tweet it out. So when, this week, Musk started tweeting about how he didn’t believe Twitter’s publicly stated claim that less than 5% of accounts on the platform are related to spam, and how he would put the deal “on hold” until he was satisfied the figures were true, a lot of commentary focused on the fact that, well, he can’t do that. The acquisition of Twitter is in motion. Musk explicitly waived his right to perform due diligence as part of his take-it-or-leave-it offer to the company. The terms of the deal allow Twitter to force Musk to complete the acquisition, with the only possible out being if his funding literally falls through, and even then, he has to pay a $1bn break-up fee. On Tuesday, the day after Musk tweeted “💩” at Twitter chief executive Parag Agrawal’s claims around spambots, the company even filed a proxy statement confirming it was committed to the acquisition. (And revealing that Musk didn’t even ask a single question about non-public info from Twitter until 5 May.) Musk has, per the rules of the game he has entered in to, no real wriggle room. He cannot fish for a lower price; he cannot simply pay $1bn walk away because he doesn’t believe the statements of Twitter; he certainly can’t leave this without giving up something. And yet! Twitter is imploding, even before Musk takes over. Agrawal aggressively reorganised his senior team, firing the head of product while on parental leave; the share price is falling, even though theoretically every shareholder stands to turn a profit the second the deal closes; staff are leaving, and the company has been thrust back into a culture war about its moderation policies. Legally, it might hold all the cards – but practically, it’s increasingly unclear that it could survive in its current form while fighting a multi-year battle to force Musk to pay up. So if, one day, the company is offered a lower price to close the acquisition ASAP – well, I think it might end up taking it. And Musk will have got away with more shit. --- There’s no purer example of this superpower than the world of cryptocurrency, though. If there’s one thing that defines the sector, it’s not playing by the same rules as everyone else. Take tether, the $80bn stablecoin that many fear might be the weak link in the entire ecosystem. (Not to be confused with Terra, the formerly-$35bn stablecoin that collapsed last week and sparked the latest round of panic that the entire edifice might be about to crumble.) Tether has a relatively simple business model: you hand it US dollars and it gives you a transferrable note saying that it’s holding money for you; whenever you want, you can hand it the note, and get your US dollars back. If you’re saying “that’s a bank”, you’re sort of right. The tether stablecoin carries out a bunch of the functions of a conventional bank in the cryptocurrency sector, and the Tether business behind it makes its money in the same basic way as a bank, investing customer deposits in safe and liquid assets to earn a profit from its reserves. But, of course, Tether is not a bank. Tether is not regulated like a bank; it does not have to comply with reserve ratios like a bank, nor obey anti-money-laundering regulations like a bank. It can get away with stuff a normal bank simply could not begin to risk. And even when it comes to the small number of things that Tether isn’t supposed to do, it still has a good record of getting away with it. Take its reserves: for years, the company promised depositors that every tether it issued was backed by US dollars. That, the New York attorney general said in 2021, “was a lie”. (Tether said at the time that the settlement it paid in response “should be viewed as a measure of our desire to put this matter behind us and focus on our business.”) Now, it simply claims its currency is “backed 100% by Tether’s reserves”, and has promised to regularly disclose what those reserves are – as well as paying a paltry fine to New York.

5/18/2022,"Russia’s defence ministry said 694 Ukrainian fighters who had been under siege at the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol had surrendered over the last 24 hours. The Russians claim 959 combatants have surrendered in total at Azovstal since Monday, and that 80 of those who surrendered were wounded, of whom 51 have been taken to hospital. The numbers have not been independently verified. Denis Pushilin, the head of the self-proclaimed republic of Donetsk, has told local media that a court will decide the fate of the Ukrainian fighters who surrendered at Azovstal. Russia claims 270 Ukrainian fighters were killed and “54 units of military equipment were disabled” overnight. It also claimed to have shot down two planes and 15 drones. The State Emergency Service of Ukraine said it neutralised 685 explosive devices on Ukrainian soil on Tuesday. The latest intelligence update from the UK’s Ministry of Defence highlights Russia’s “significant resourcing problems in Ukraine”, which it says “is likely contributing to a disunited command which continues to hamper Russia’s operations”. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, will appear at Kyiv’s Solomyansky district court from 2pm local time charged with war crimes and premeditated murder over the death of a 62-year-old man in north-east Ukraine on 28 February. The international criminal court on Tuesday sent a 42-member team to Ukraine to investigate alleged war crimes since the Russian invasion, in what it called the largest such deployment in its history. The US will create a new unit to research, document and publicise alleged war crimes by Russia in Ukraine. The Conflict Observatory will “capture, analyse and make widely available evidence of Russia-perpetrated war crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine,” the US state department said. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said there was no movement in peace talks with Ukraine, and claimed Kyiv was showing a total unwillingness to continue them. The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has said the UK is open to the idea of an international criminal tribunal trying Vladimir Putin and other Russian leaders over the war. Austria’s foreign minister, Alexander Schallenberg, told the German broadcaster Deutschlandfunk that his country would stay militarily neutral. “The situation for us looks a little different,” he said when asked about Sweden and Finland applying to join Nato.",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 84 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/18/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-84-of-the-invasion
5/18/2022,"The re-emergence of inflation as a serious problem has been rapid and dramatic. This time a year ago, the government’s preferred way of measuring the cost of living showed prices had risen by 1.5% over the previous 12 months. The latest figure is 9% – a rate the UK has not experienced in more than 40 years – and there is worse to come. April’s figure was fractionally lower than the 9.1% economists had expected but that was the extent of the good news. Inflation is now running at almost double the level anticipated by the Bank of England six months ago and looks set to rise above 10% when energy bills go up again in the autumn. For poorer households, which spend more on food and energy, inflation is already running at double-digit rates, according to two thinktanks: the Resolution Foundation and the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The IFS notes the 10.9% inflation rate faced by the poorest 10% of the population was three percentage points higher than that faced by the richest 10%. Prices rose by 2.5% in April alone, and the main reason for that was a 54% jump in the cost of electricity and gas bills as the higher price cap came into force. Electricity is 53.5% up on a year ago, while gas is 95.5% more expensive. However, dearer energy is only part of the story, with evidence growing that inflationary pressures are now being felt in other parts of the economy. The Office for National Statistics breaks down the headline inflation number into 12 separate categories. While the most striking increases have been in energy and transport, clothing and footwear prices have risen by 8.3% over the past year, furniture by 10.5%, and restaurants and hotels by 7.9%. The hospitality sector has also been hit by the ending of the temporary reduction in VAT in April. What is happening is that firms facing big increases in the costs of fuel, raw material and labour are passing on at least some of the increases to their customers. The cost of goods leaving factory gates is up 14% on a year ago, and that is being reflected in the prices being paid by consumers. Inflation is likely to fall back a bit in the coming months but the respite will be modest and temporary. There will be further increases in interest rates from the Bank of England as it seeks to prevent inflation becoming embedded in the economy, and renewed calls on Rishi Sunak to increase support for those most affected by rising prices. In his response to the latest inflation figures, the chancellor sought to deflect criticism of the government over its handling of the cost of living crisis by noting other countries were facing similar pressures. “We cannot protect people completely from these global challenges but are providing significant support where we can, and stand ready to take further action,” Sunak said. But blaming global factors is not going to prevent the calls for action from growing louder and the words “stand ready” are a clear sign that the Treasury will come up with something to help those most affected by rising inflation. The only questions are how generous the support package will be, and when it will arrive.",News/Business,"Soaring UK inflation makes action from Rishi Sunak a question of when, not if",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/18/soaring-uk-inflation-makes-action-from-rishi-sunak-a-question-of-when-not-if

5/18/2022,"The tunnel at Whiskey 108 – and whether there were any people hiding in it – continues to dominate and divide the Ben Roberts-Smith defamation trial, with an SAS soldier accusing a comrade of cowardice over a raid on the compound in the Afghan village of Kakarak. At issue is whether two men killed in the compound in April 2009, were pulled from the tunnel and murdered by Australian troops, or were insurgents lawfully killed in a firefight. The argument has split the Australian SAS troops who were there: Roberts-Smith and five other soldiers have said there were no men in the tunnel. A further five have said there were men pulled from the tunnel. Another soldier, Person 4, who is alleged to have shot dead one of the men on Roberts-Smith’s orders, refused to testify on the grounds of self-incrimination. Even members of the same patrol have come to court and given irreconcilable evidence. Five members of one patrol have been subpoenaed to give evidence: they have split three-two over the whether anybody ever came out of the tunnel. The patrol commander, Person 29, has told the court in evidence for Roberts-Smith that there were no people discovered inside the tunnel. He has been supported by two other members of that patrol – Person 35 and Person 38, who gave evidence for Roberts-Smith on Wednesday. Asked if he had seen any “fighting-aged males” come out of the tunnel at Whiskey 108, Person 38 told the court: “I did not.” But two other members of the patrol, Person 41 and Person 40, both giving evidence as part of the newspapers’ defence, have said two unarmed men – one elderly, the other with a prosthetic leg – were discovered inside the tunnel and were taken into custody by Australian troops. In his testimony, Person 41 said Roberts-Smith and Person 4 had borrowed his suppressor before Roberts-Smith forced the elderly man into a kneeling position. “RS pointed to the Afghan and said to Person 4 ‘shoot him’,” Person 41 told the court. Person 41 told the court he stepped through a door so as not to witness the alleged killing, but heard a muffled shot fired, and returned to see Person 4 standing above the man’s body. Person 41 testified he later saw Roberts-Smith “frog-march” the man with the prosthetic leg outside the compound, before throwing him to the ground and shooting him with a machine gun. Roberts-Smith, a Victoria Cross recipient, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges are defamatory and portray him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies any wrongdoing. It is not disputed that at least two Afghan men were killed by Australian SAS troops during their raid on Whiskey 108 in the late afternoon of 12 April 2009. In their defence, the newspapers claim two men were discovered hiding inside the tunnel. The men submitted to the Australian troops and were taken into custody. The elderly man was allegedly shot dead in the compound by an Australian soldier, Person 4, on the orders of Roberts-Smith and his patrol commander. The second man was alleged to have been marched outside by Roberts-Smith and machine-gunned to death. Roberts-Smith denies either killing happened as alleged, and argues they could not have, because there was never anybody in the tunnel. Four times during his evidence to court, he told Justice Anthony Besanko “there were no men in the tunnel”, or “there were no people in the tunnel”. Roberts-Smith said he shot and killed the man with a prosthetic leg, whom he discovered running and armed, outside the compound. The man was an insurgent, lawfully killed within the laws of war, Roberts-Smith said The elderly man, according to Roberts-Smith, was killed outside the compound by another Australian soldier, unknown to him, but whom he credits with saving his life. Person 38, giving evidence for Roberts-Smith Wednesday about the Whiskey 108 raid, told the court that after the tunnel was discovered, he “cleared” – swept for insurgents and weapons and then rendered safe – a nearby orchard with his patrol-mate Person 41. This evidence, he conceded, was not part of his outline of evidence provided to the court. Person 38 said he remembered clearing the orchard because he had initially asked another patrol-mate, Person 40, to clear the orchard with him, but that Person 40 refused. “Person 40 did not want to clear that orchard with me for reasons of courage. And Person 41 to his credit, took his place and cleared that orchard with me,” Person 38 told the court. Testimony about Person 41’s movements are critical because of his evidence to the court about being asked for his suppressor – then allegedly used in the killing of the elderly man – and his eyewitness account of seeing the man with the prosthetic leg murdered. Nicholas Owens SC, for the newspapers, put it to Person 38 he had fabricated the orchard story in order to bolster Roberts-Smith’s version of events. “That is incorrect,” Person 38 replied. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Owens asked Person 38 why, if the orchard story was true, he had not included it in his outline of evidence. Person 38 said it wasn’t “pivotal”. “I’ve been subpoenaed to come here and tell the truth,” he said. “It’s not in my outline of evidence, but it’s the truth.” Owens put it to Person 38 he had “never told anyone before today” about clearing the orchard and had “only invented this story” after Person 41 had given evidence about both alleged executions, in order to place Person 41 elsewhere in the compound. “That’s not correct,” Person 38 said. “I cleared that orchard with Person 41.” Person 38 remains in the witness box under cross-examination.",News/Australia news,Ben Roberts-Smith’s defamation trial hears conflicting evidence over Afghan deaths,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/18/ben-roberts-smiths-defamation-trial-hears-conflicting-evidence-over-afghan-deaths
5/18/2022,"A Home Office deportation flight to Jamaica took off in the early hours of Wednesday morning with seven people onboard. Some media reports said the Home Office initially had 100 people on the list of Jamaican nationals that officials hoped to remove. Although the number was low it was more than the four who left on a Jamaica deportation flight last November. Four of the most recent flights had 17, 13, seven and four people onboard. Home Office deportation flights to Jamaica are among the most contentious carried out by the department as many of those earmarked for removal have Windrush connections or have been in the UK since childhood, with children and other close relatives in the country. Some convicted of drugs and firearms offences as teenagers have been found to be victims of county lines grooming and exploitation. At lunchtime on Tuesday there were still almost 20 people due to fly but many had their tickets cancelled after legal actions were lodged on their behalf. Among those who did not fly was Mark Nelson, who has lived in the UK for 22 years, has five British children and was facing deportation following a conviction for cultivating cannabis plants. A 34-year-old man with severe learning difficulties also had his ticket cancelled. About 30 detainees not due to fly to Jamaica blocked the exercise yard at Colnbrook immigration removal centre near Heathrow airport on Tuesday evening to try to prevent officers from removing three men due to fly. The protest was dispersed and the three men were taken to Stansted airport to board the flight. Karen Doyle of Movement for Justice, an organisation that has been campaigning against Wednesday’s charter flight, said: “At 2am this morning we had to comfort a new mum whose family and future have been ripped apart. Today she has to tell their five-year-old daughter who dotes on her daddy that he’ll likely never again be in the same room as them. These flights are brutal and inhumane.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “Those with no right to be in the UK, including foreign national offenders, should be in no doubt that we will do whatever is necessary to remove them. This is what the public rightly expects and why we regularly operate flights to different countries. “The new plan for immigration will fix the broken immigration system and stop the abuse we are seeing by expediting the removal of those who have no right to be here.”",News/UK news,UK deportation flight to Jamaica takes off with seven onboard,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/18/home-office-deportation-flight-jamaica-takes-off
5/18/2022,"After a century of attempts by Black activists and lawmakers, President Joe Biden signed the Emmett Till Anti-Lynching Act on the White House lawn, surrounded by Black politicians, clergy, and nonprofit leaders. The new federal law makes lynching a hate crime. Representative Bobby Rush, the bill’s sponsor in the House of Representatives, called the moment “a day of enormous consequence for our nation.” But I had questions. Doubts really. Do white supremacists kill Black people because we did not have a federal anti-lynching law? If not, then does Congress think that such a law will be a deterrent? Will federal prosecutors listen to Black families who say their children were lynched – or to police and coroners who call suspicious deaths “suicides”? Will this law punish civilians for violence but reward them if they join police departments? I sent my editor a draft of an essay questioning the Emmett Till Anti-Lynching Act. I did not have the energy to respond to the potential backlash from readers, so I sat on my criticisms, reflected on my arguments and prayed that I would be wrong. Then last week, an 18 year old white supremacist drove to a grocery store in Buffalo, New York and murdered 10 Black people. He published a manifesto espousing his horrific views and penciled a racial slur on his gun. Maybe he hadn’t heard about the consequences listed in the Emmett Till Anti-Lynching Act. Or, maybe he was willing to accept them in exchange for the lives he took. Cops arrested him like they arrested white supremacist shooter Dylann Roof– alive and with care. I can only imagine the power and affirmation that elders and ancestors would feel to witness a federal anti-lynching act finally become law in the United States, and then a couple of months later, another mass lynching happens. It pains me to picture what they endured: the bodies that Black people pulled down from ropes, the ashes they swept into sacred canisters, the swollen babies they recovered from riverbanks. It blesses me to think of their resistance, too. Black activists formed anti-lynching organizations, created self-defense teams, wrote newspaper articles, boycotted white establishments, ran for office, sued in courts, demanded legislation, and much more. They fought white mobs, escaped, and turned potential victims into survivors. These anti-lynching crusaders used so many different tactics to not only try to end lynching, but to try to end the kind of society where Black people could be vulnerable to the rope. Throughout US history, Black and multiracial social movements demanded economic, educational, and medical justice to increase their agency to live the kinds of lives that they deserved. Others pushed these measures for over a 100 years because they probably believed that criminalization might deter Ku Klux Klan members, cops, and white communities from murdering Black people. However, it is the duty of the living to learn the contexts for the particular demands that activists agitated for throughout history, and determine the utility of their tactics today. People who care about justice, and those of us who are courageous enough to fight for it, must refuse to solely accept symbolic civil rights acts if we truly want to save lives. For example, decriminalization activists and scholars have demonstrated that calls for criminalization are not the deterrent to crime that many of us assume, especially since the US often perpetuates the violence that it seeks to punish. Instead, criminalization fuels surveillance, policing, incarceration, poverty, and communal violence that makes society less safe for us all. Anti-criminalization organizers argue that these consequences also bear down on the people that the law was theoretically intended to protect. In 2015, prosecutors charged and a judge convicted a Black person under an anti-lynching law for attempting to protect a Black Lives Matter protestor from being arrested. If Congress wanted to actually fight white supremacist violence, it could fund grants for schools to teach racial justice education. Biden signed the Emmett Till Anti-Lynching Act at a time when states are making it illegal to teach about Emmett Till. If the federal government wants to stop or at least slow down a new generation of potential white supremacists, it must make vigorous, affirmative efforts to openly and financially support schools and community organizations doing this work. Instead of giving more money to the police departments that often hire white supremacists, the federal government could give money to organizations that help white people leave white supremacist organizations and discourage them from joining. Additionally, the US president should stop promising to give more money to the police after a cop kills a Black person. It is a perverse payday that affirms the actions of police to the white supremacist spectators who emulate cops. What’s terrifying is that the Buffalo shooter did not have to commit a mass killing; he literally could have just joined any of the thousands of police departments and killed Black people over time. The prevalence of explicit white supremacists joining law enforcement agencies is so high that the country’s top law enforcement agency- the FBI- has been sounding the alarm to raise awareness for more than two decades. And despite the rise in killings by police, Republicans and Democrats largely compete to give cops more funding, credibility, and protection. Congress must also commit to ending wars and militarism. Major violent institutions like prisons, police departments, and the military are bastions for white supremacist recruiters who grab isolated and alienated working-class white people to build their ranks. War additionally inspires civilians in the US to violently attack people who descend from places where our drones drop. Or, they join rightwing militia groups like the Oathkeepers, Sheepdogs, and Proud Boys to cement a war-like mentality often replete with martial gear and training. Thus, it is no surprise that the Buffalo shooter dressed in the similar military fashion that many other white, male mass shooters wear during their violence. Demilitarization, decriminalization, decarceration, and defunding the police all help to shrink the sites of armed, white supremacist organizing. As we continue to build an abolitionist society, let us never forget that the same state that has passed this anti-lynching legislation is at the root of what conditioned the Buffalo shooter to target Black people.

5/18/2022,"One million have died from Covid-19 in the United States, a catastrophic milestone that was reached despite the wonders of modern science and the wealth that courses through this country. More than two years into the pandemic, it is hard to shock people any longer. One hundred thousand deaths, it seemed, attracted far more attention. How did we get it here? How much of this mass death was preventable? These are questions that we will be sorting out for many years to come. There are no simple answers. In order to have a fighting chance in the next pandemic, though, it’s incumbent to consider just what went horrifically wrong. First, it must be noted that America, among advanced nations, was not alone in enduring terrible loss from Covid. Both the United Kingdom and Italy have comparable death rates. Multiple waves have overwhelmed other European nations with superior healthcare apparatuses. Taming a pandemic is incredibly difficult and few countries emerged unscathed. Given America’s vast size and decentralized governance structure—federalism guarantees 50 states can often act like 50 nations—a zero-Covid approach would have been unfeasible. Some liberals looked longingly to New Zealand, an island nation smaller than New York City, for guidance, though even the Kiwis eventually gave up on such radical lockdowns. China is currently trying to stamp out Covid by imprisoning millions of their own citizens in their homes and restricting travel abroad. The Covid death rate remains low, but the social repercussions of such severe policies will be felt for the rest of the decade, as more affluent Chinese citizens consider fleeing a country that has no regard left for their civil liberties. Still, there are clear failures unique to the United States. The aforementioned federalism made national public health messaging and decision-making exceedingly difficult. Donald Trump, deeply unhinged and ignorant, was the worst president possible to sit atop such bureaucracy. With little federal guidance, individual governors, mayors, and county executives were on their own to set policy, flailing about against a new virus few truly understood. Some, like Jay Inslee in Washington and London Breed in San Francisco, rose to the occasion, initiating well-timed early lockdowns and placing rational public health officials at the forefront of their pandemic responses. Others, like Andrew Cuomo in New York, failed miserably, dithering until it was too late. From the beginning of the pandemic, public health messaging was deeply muddled, with various epidemiologists and self-appointed experts, along with government officials, taking to the internet to offer conflicting advice. In February 2020, as Covid was beginning to spread in the United States, mainstream media outlets and a sizable number of officials were telling Americans to actively avoid wearing masks. The rationale – save high-quality masks for healthcare workers – did not justify telling ordinary people to ignore their common-sense and the long history of masking during the flu pandemic of 1918. The early months of the pandemic produced other nonsensical policies from experts who should have known better. Quickly, scientists learned Covid was airborne, yet parks and other outdoor spaces remained shuttered for months. While the virus was ravaging New York, playgrounds in the Midwest had red tape thrown around them. Few states, liberal or conservative, emphasized the need for proper ventilation in public and private buildings. More outdoor events, coupled with mask-wearing, could have ushered a faster return to normalcy as Americans were educated about the importance of proper airflow. A hundred years ago, scientists and doctors knew it was better to treat flu-ravaged patients outside. Some municipalities even pursued outdoor schooling. For reasons unclear, these lessons were lost to time. The vaccine era brought more failure. Public health experts either didn’t understand Covid would produce variants or misled Americans on the nature of the Moderna, Pfizer, and J&J vaccines. Those that first took vaccines were led to believe that Covid would simply stop spreading once they were vaccinated and all pandemic-era precautions could be ended. Dr Anthony Fauci and others told the vaccinated they could cluster unmasked without any fear that Covid would infect them anew. What vaccines did do remarkably well was prevent people from going to the hospital. But they were never pitched this way – rather, many believed they were magic potions that would make Covid disappear – and the surge of breakthrough infections in the summer and fall of 2021 further sowed distrust. Fauci, who had once called Covid a pandemic of the “unvaccinated,” couldn’t plausibly say this any longer when the Omicron variant was tearing through highly vaccinated locales like New York. Right-wing misinformation doomed older Americans in Republican-leaning counties. Though Trump himself was a booster of the vaccines because they were developed under his administration, it was Joe Biden administering them, and Republican demagogues turned on the products of Operation Warp Speed. Conspiracy theories, fueled by the right, undercut trust in the vaccines. Conservatives rushed to unproven treatments. The deadly Delta wave in 2021 came for the Republican-dominated states that wrongly believed Covid was simply a problem for the big liberal cities. Rural counties suffered mightily. Other lessons from the pandemic do not fit neatly into the narratives of the left or the right. Few Democrats want to remember it was Kamala Harris, during a vice presidential debate in 2020, who said she’d hesitate to take a vaccine if Trump were president. Months later, she would be taking doses from the very vaccines she was foolishly attacking for political points. Right-wingers can’t acknowledge that fewer Americans would have probably died if Trump had never been president. It’s possible, too, that vaccine uptake in America would have been more widespread if greater options were offered and effective treatments were prioritized. Both Moderna and Pfizer rely on mRNA technology not traditionally used in vaccines; their novelty bred conspiracy-minded thinking, especially on the right. With J&J’s vaccine effectively off the market—the FDA strictly limited it because of a risk of a rare clotting condition—only mRNA vaccines are widely available until Novavax’s vaccine, which uses conventional protein technology, is greenlit later in the summer. In retrospect, it would have been beneficial to have a proven pharmaceutical giant like Pfizer producing a conventional vaccine to entice a broader range of Americans. With new variants and future pandemics inevitable, Congress must authorize far more in federal funding for proper preparedness. Research must never cease—particularly into medical treatments for Covid and other pandemic strains—and local health departments should be properly supported. Hospital capacity must be expanded wherever possible, especially in the wake of so many ICU facilities, in small towns and big cities alike, rapidly filling up during various waves. One million people should never have to die from another pandemic. Not in America, a country built to do so much better. Ross Barkan is a journalist based in New York City.
