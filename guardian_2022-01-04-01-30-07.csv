1/4/2022,"The roulette wheel is spinning, the ball already rattling towards its final destination. Boris Johnson has bet the house on his Omicron gamble and now there’s no going back. The bullishness of ministers insisting over the weekend that they see no case for further restrictions glosses over the fact that it may now be too late for that anyway, given an estimated one in 25 people in England already had the virus before New Year’s Eve. Double or quits it is, then, as a country drags itself back out to work and school after the Christmas hibernation period. We’re about to find out exactly what it means to experience unprecedented levels of Covid infections, but from a strain that may be less dangerous, at least in the fully vaccinated. Once again, a virus we thought we’d got to know has abruptly shapeshifted and once again, history isn’t necessarily a reliable guide to the present. We’re all back on the seesaw, lurching between hope and fear, never knowing quite what to expect.  The novel threat this time is not death on the biblical scale forecast during the first wave – although sadly there will be too many deaths, hospitalisations and cases of long Covid disabling people for months to come – but knock-on chaos and disruption caused by the potential mass infection of key workers, leaving them unable to do their work. We’ve entered an unpredictable world of people who have heart attacks waiting for well over an hour for an ambulance, critical incidents being declared by hospitals that can’t maintain safe staffing levels and large organisations being warned to plan for up to a quarter of their people being off sick or self-isolating. Now imagine what that worst-case scenario might do to the everyday grind of supermarket deliveries, bin collections and bus timetables, let alone to policing or critical infrastructure such as the power and water industries. Education ministers have meanwhile vowed to keep schools and nurseries open wherever possible – rightly given the profound impact we now know closures had on poorer children’s education, and on a vulnerable few who are sadly safer with their teachers than with their parents – but are simultaneously letting heads know they can send year groups home if they have to. For secondary schools in England and Wales hit by serious staff shortages, in practice that would probably mean prioritising GCSE and A-level classes for pupils who need to sit their mocks this term but switching to home schooling for other years if necessary, something already happening in some parts of the country before Christmas as Omicron hit. Nurseries and primary schools catering for pupils too young to be vaccinated will meanwhile be flinging windows open to the January air and crossing their fingers, knowing that (at least according to the Office for National Statistics) about one in 15 children aged between two and 11 had Covid before Christmas. Since many key workers are also parents who can’t easily do their jobs if their child gets sent home sick, we’re probably about to be reminded that childcare is the fourth emergency service, without which the other three would struggle very quickly. In other words, it’s time to prepare ourselves at least for the possibility of things getting messy; of everyday life becoming harder and more volatile as Covid jams its spokes into wheels that in good times you barely even notice turning. With luck, that upheaval could be mercifully brief. But any country that nearly ground to a halt overnight thanks to a temporary post-Brexit shortage of fuel tanker drivers and a panicky stampede for petrol should probably have learned by now not to get cocky. Over and over again this virus has reminded us of just how much happens unseen beneath the surface of a functioning society; of how complex our just-in-time modern lives with all their endlessly interconnected moving parts have become, but also how fragile, dependent on things and people we mostly take for granted until brutally reminded not to do so. And that’s why learning to live with this or any other virus, the mantra of those who never want their liberties restricted by government diktat again, doesn’t mean quite what some hope it does. It’s not about ripping off your mask and gleefully forgetting that any of it ever happened, but about building in resilience and learning from the weaknesses exposed by Covid. Rubbing along successfully through what might hopefully be the tail end of a pandemic should mean investing not just in vaccines and antivirals but in more hospital beds and people to staff them, creating enough slack in the system to absorb seasonal Covid surges without having to throw up tent wards in NHS car parks. It’s going to mean well-honed contingency plans for critical industries, better ventilation in schools, and more imaginative answers to the question of protecting people who are shielding or clinically vulnerable than are so far forthcoming from lockdown sceptics bellowing that it’s time everyone was left to get on with their lives. But it may also take something of a shift in national attitudes. Living successfully with Covid-19 will require not just a virus obliging enough not to mutate in more lethal ways but the maturity to self-police sometimes – as plenty did last month by voluntarily side-swerving parties or the pub so they could have Christmas with their families, and as Swedes have always quietly done in what was the unsung element of their country’s no-lockdown policy – and the resilience to live with a degree of unpredictability in life, which is infinitely easier said than done for some. Low-income families especially are likely to need help absorbing the sudden shocks and disruptions this virus is still capable of delivering, even as it hopefully burns itself out. The silver lining to the Omicron cloud is, of course, that it could pass relatively quickly. It’s risky reading too much into data collected over the Christmas holidays when reporting was potentially patchy, but all hopes are now pinned on Britain following the same path as South Africa, where infections seemed to peak relatively quickly before falling back. A rocky few weeks, so the cabinet’s argument goes, beats months of economic and personal misery; better to rip the plaster off and get it over with. Whether that gamble was uncharacteristically shrewd or lethally reckless will become clear enough in the next few days as Omicron spreads from London to the rest of the UK, with hospitalisation rates doubling already across much of the north of England. But right now, the wretched roulette wheel is still spinning, and all most of us can do about it is hold our breath.

1/4/2022,"Antonio Conte says he has nothing to prove to anyone at Chelsea as he prepares for a first return to Stamford Bridge since his sacking in 2018. The manager goes back with Tottenham on Wednesday night for the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg and it is sure to be emotional, given the relationships he made during his two seasons in west London. Conte won the Premier League in his first campaign, seeing off the challenge of Spurs – then managed by Mauricio Pochettino – and he followed it up with an FA Cup triumph in his second season, his team beating Manchester United in the final. It was not enough, however, to earn him a longer stay.  Conte’s focus is on the cup game and managing a return of Covid cases to his squad. After the large outbreak in December that led to Spurs being forced to postpone their Europa Conference League tie against Rennes and the league fixture at Brighton, Conte said the club were “checking a couple of situations about Covid” with regard to players, although he was “not sure 100% that they’re going to miss the game.” Yet Conte did acknowledge the romantic side of the story that pits him against the club that gave him his first opportunity to work in England. “I spent two seasons where I created a good relationship with players, staff, people who work at Chelsea,” Conte said. “We did a really good job and I think in my position I mustn’t prove anything to anyone. I’m a manager that has experience and continues to have experience and do important jobs at other teams. It’ll be a pleasure for me to come back to Stamford Bridge.” Conte is acutely aware that Spurs have won nothing since 2008 but he also knows that Chelsea are at a different stage of development. “At this moment, Chelsea is more ready than us to win,” he said. “They won the Champions League last season. We have a lot of space for improvement, to be a team with aspirations to win. To use the verb ‘to win’ is more simple than winning because to win you have to build something important, be solid, have an important squad. Then you’re ready to win. Otherwise you have to hope.” On the disruption of Covid cases, Conte said: “We are living with this situation – not only Tottenham but all the clubs. We have to be ready to find always the right solutions. For sure it’s not simple for any coach to change the plan you have, especially when you play many games in a short time. You make a plan in your mind and sometimes you arrive and players are positive so you have to totally change your plan.”",Sport/Football,Antonio Conte insists he has nothing to prove on Chelsea return with Spurs,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/03/antonio-conte-nothing-to-prove-chelsea-return-with-spurs-carabao-cup-covid-cases
1/4/2022,"Multiple NHS trusts have declared “critical incidents” amid soaring staff absences caused by Covid, as health leaders said pressure was increasingly spreading to hospitals outside London. More than half a dozen trusts in England have issued alerts over “internal critical incidents” in the last few days, it is understood, amid mounting concerns some may be unable to deliver vital care to patients.  Health leaders said the “rapidly increasing” number of absent NHS staff was piling “very serious” pressure on hospitals already struggling to cope with increasing Covid admissions and “huge wider pressure” on urgent and emergency services. Hospitals in the north-east and Yorkshire have reported the most rapid growth in Covid patients in recent days. However, NHS chiefs also expressed cautious optimism that after weeks of rising hospitalisations in London – the centre of the Omicron outbreak – that the increases may have peaked and are starting to “plateau”. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS hospital, mental health, community and ambulance services, said: “We were seeing increases in the number of Covid-19 patients in London hospitals go up by 9% a day, 15% a day  …  in terms of 27, 28 and 29 December. Interestingly, in the last two days the increases have only been 1% and 2%, so they’ve dropped pretty significantly, so there’s a hope we might have seen a possible peak and plateau.” Another piece of positive news, he added, was that hospitals were still not admitting large numbers of seriously ill older people with Covid. Hopson said it was “striking” that hospital bosses were “pointing to the fact” outbreaks in care homes were “not translating into hospital admissions”. He cautioned that the “biggest challenge” facing many NHS trusts in the first week of the new year was mounting staff absences and as a result, he said, “a number of trusts across [the] country have declared internal critical incidents over the last few days”. United Lincolnshire hospitals NHS trust declared a “critical incident” with “extreme and unprecedented” staff shortages resulting in “compromised care”. Joe Harrison, the chief executive of Milton Keynes University hospital, said while his trust was not yet declaring a critical incident, he expected the “very pressured” situation to get worse before it got better. Meanwhile, in Yorkshire, the ambulance service said: “The added challenge of Covid-19-related absence among staff … is having a significant impact on our frontline operations.” Earlier on Monday, Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary, had appeared to play down the crisis, saying the NHS was “very good at being able to move staff around”. He said hospitals were used to dealing with staff being off over the winter and during “big flu viruses”. But in a blog published on Monday, Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents the healthcare system in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, said many parts of the health service were “currently in a state of crisis”. “In the face of high levels of demand and staff absence some hospitals are having to declare a ‘critical incident’,” he wrote. “Some hospitals are making urgent calls to exhausted staff to give up rest days and leave to enable them to sustain core services. Many more hospitals are having to ban visitors to try to reduce the spread of infection. “Community and social care services, which were already massively overstretched, are at breaking point. In many areas, ambulance services are unable to meet their target response times. Primary care is having to add caring for Covid-19 patients and trying to keep them out of hospitals to driving the booster programme and dealing with unprecedented underlying demand, which is driven in part by the millions of unwell people waiting for appointments and operations.” Taylor also urged politicians “making optimism and complacency a kind of political virility symbol” not to turn Covid policy “into a new terrain for the culture wars”, but instead to focus on the facts and “listen to those trying to cope on the frontline”. Meanwhile, the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has written to Sajid Javid, the health secretary, calling for further measures in England amid “confusing and concerning” differences in restrictions across the UK. “Nursing professionals are questioning the level and nature of the variation between governments,” wrote the RCN’s council chair, Carol Popplestone, and its general secretary, Pat Cullen. “We therefore ask that, as secretary of state for health and social care, you work with counterparts across government on a more cautious approach for England without further delay.”",News/Society,NHS trusts declare critical incidents amid Covid staff crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/03/several-nhs-trusts-declare-critical-incidents-amid-covid-staff-crisis
1/4/2022,"An estimated 12 people a day died or disappeared while trying to reach Spain in 2021, more than double the total for the previous year. The 4,404 refugees who perished included 205 children, according to Caminando Fronteras (Walking Borders). In a report published on Monday, the NGO noted that the number of deaths was more than twice the 2,170 deaths and disappearances recorded in 2020.  “It’s horrible,” said Helena Maleno, who leads Caminando Fronteras. “These are the worst figures we’ve seen since we began keeping count in 2007.” The report drew a direct link between the steep rise in the number of deaths and European efforts to curb migration in the Mediterranean. As a result, refugees have turned increasingly to the treacherous Canary Islands route – one of the most dangerous crossings into Europe – setting off in unstable vessels that are often unfit to face the fierce currents of the Atlantic. Up until 28 December last year, 22,200 migrants landed on the shores of the Canary Islands, according to the Spanish government. Caminando Fronteras estimated that 4,016 people died or vanished along the route, suggesting that for approximately every six people who make it to the Spanish archipelago, one person dies or disappears. The figures compiled by Caminando Fronteras are drawn from the work it does in fielding distress calls from migrants or their families and alerting coastguards and maritime rescue services. The NGO also logs missing vessels and works with relatives to identify the missing and the dead. “The 4,404 is the minimum number,” said Maleno. “The truth is that there could be more victims that we aren’t aware of.” Boats en route to Spain often vanish without a trace, in part explaining why the bodies of 95% of those who died or disappear are never recovered. People who were lost attempting to reach Spain came from 21 countries, from the Ivory Coast to Sri Lanka, many fleeing armed conflict or the consequences of climate change. Those who do make it to Spain, particularly via the Canary Islands route, are often haunted by the journey. “The waves were taller than the dinghy,” one survivor told Caminando Fronteras after a voyage in which 15 of the 58 people onboard were lost. “The waves washed people away, sweeping them off the boat,” they said. Another man from Mali described spending days lost at sea as food and water supplies dwindled and nearly all of the 59 people onboard succumbed to starvation. After 19 days adrift, rescuers found him and two others barely alive. He had spent much of the trip force-feeding a young boy who also managed to survive. “I would open his mouth to feed him a scrap of biscuit with the bit of water that was left and tell him to swallow,” he said. “He looked dead.” On Monday, Caminando Fronteras called on the Spanish government to take urgent steps to address the rise in deaths, noting that more than three decades had passed since a body turned up on the shores of Andalusia, in what is believed to be the first known death of a Spain-bound refugee. “In those 34 years, the idea that people can die by crossing a border has become something that people have accepted as normal,” said Maleno. “It’s not normal.” The International Organization for Migration has described 2021 as the deadliest for migration routes to and within Europe since 2018. At least 1,315 people have died on the central Mediterranean crossing, while at least 41 lives were lost at the land border between Turkey and Greece. In November, 27 refugees, including a pregnant woman and three children, drowned in the Channel while trying to cross from France to the UK.",News/World news,Death toll of refugees attempting to reach Spain doubles in 2021,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/death-toll-of-refugees-attempting-to-reach-spain-doubles-in-2021
1/4/2022,"Some wild birds can now be killed in order to protect game birds bred for shooting in England, after the government updated guidelines on its general licences. General shooting licences give broad permissions to shoot certain species of wild birds to protect livestock, aid conservation, and preserve health and public safety.  The new licences have been issued for two years rather than one, with government officials saying this is to provide “stability and certainty” to shooters. General licences are permissive licences, meaning users do not need to apply for them but they must comply with their terms and conditions when undertaking licensed acts. There has been debate over whether pheasants, partridges and grouse count as livestock, as they are wild birds, and so whether predators can be shot in order to protect them. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has released a new definition of “livestock” including these birds, to give explicit permission to shoot carrion crows, jackdaws, magpies and rooks. It reads: “‘Livestock’ is as defined in section 27(1) of the 1981 [Wildlife and Countryside] Act. For the purpose of this licence, this expression also includes game birds kept in an enclosure or which are free roaming but remain significantly dependent on the provision of food, water or shelter by a keeper for their survival. This does not include supplementary feeding.” A Defra spokesperson said the change was made after gamekeepers asked for more clarity about whether game birds counted as livestock. The new language makes it clear that wild predatory birds cannot be shot under this licence in order to protect wild game birds that are not dependent on food and shelter from humans, but they can be shot under the licence if they are. The official added: “The new general licences have been updated to clarify when they apply and make clear when a game bird ceases to be livestock and becomes a wild bird. None of the changes alter the activities licence users are authorised to do. “We continue to work with stakeholders to ensure our licensing process is robust for wildlife and workable for users going forward.” Conservation groups raised concerns that the update could mean an increase in the killing of wild birds. The RSPB’s head of site conservation policy, Kate Jennings, said: “If this update to the livestock general licence goes beyond a reclassification of terminology and implies that it will lead to an increase in the killing of wild birds to protect game bird interests, then given the nature and climate emergency we find ourselves in, this would be a massive backward step for nature conservation in this country.” The general licences have been challenged by wildlife groups including the BBC presenter Chris Packham’s Wild Justice. His group has challenged the legislation and in 2019 managed to get it suspended. Wild Justice has since managed to secure changes including removing all gull species, and the places they can be used no longer include sites of special scientific interest and other nature reserves.",News/Environment,Law change allows wild birds to be killed to protect game birds in England,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/03/law-change-allows-wild-birds-killed-protect-game-birds-england
1/4/2022,"It’s been 20 years since pallid faces, dark eyes and black clothes haunted UK secondary schools and shopping centres. While some might argue that they never left, merely retreating into the shadows, the consensus for 2022 is that goth style is returning to mainstream culture with a vengeance. There are some differences this time. The modern goth is more likely to take inspiration from ultra-glam “hot goth girlfriends” such as Kourtney Kardashian and Megan Fox and the fashion world darlings Rick Owens and Yohji Yamamoto than the Marilyn Manson-loving self-proclaimed outsiders of the early 2000s.  They are also more likely to integrate elements of a darker style of dressing into their wardrobes than to subscribe to a whole culture and lifestyle, with shopping platforms and social media sites reporting huge increases in searches containing the word “goth”. “At one point there was an idea goth was ‘strange and unusual’, but it doesn’t feel that way any more. I wouldn’t like to say it’s mainstream, but it’s much more visible,” said Catherine Spooner, a professor at Lancaster University who specialises in gothic culture. Andrew Groves, professor of fashion design at the University of Westminster, sees the new goth style as a reaction to the preening, gym-honed, Instagram-filtered perfection of the 2010s. “It has become unappealing. Instead, smudged eyeliner, bitten oxblood lips, and a deathly pallor have once again become enticing.” He said it’s unsurprising that people are looking for ways to express darker emotions aesthetically when “we have been overwhelmed with news about death, mortality, and illness” since the beginning of the pandemic, while school closures have lent themselves to a mood of “romantic disengagement, sullenness, and introspection” among teens. The clothing resale app Depop, which is popular with Gen Z consumers, reported a 20% increase in “goth” and “gothcore” searches over the past three months, including a 200% spike for “black corset top” in October. Sophie Daly, who runs a goth clothing business on Depop, said the new approach to goth style is to mix and match influences as online communities have connected previously disparate tribes, united by a love for sombre palettes and dark thoughts. She said: “Visually a goth could literally be anything now. In 2022, goths don’t even have to wear black.” She said videos on TikTok, such as those under the #goth hashtag, which has 8.8bn views, are fuelling the interest in vintage goth fashion, with some sellers auctioning pieces for up to £350 due to high demand. The shopping platform Lyst said searches for collections by the cult goth designer Rick Owens, which feature black leather and punk details such as rips and zips, have grown by 200% this year. Searches for black items have grown 169%, while chokers have grown by 81% and fishnet tops by 196%. Pinterest data, meanwhile, points to the goth aesthetic influencing everyday life. Searches for “goth business casual”, described as “Wednesday Addams goes to the office”, are up by 90% this year, with goth baby clothes up 120%, goth decor by 85%, and searches for goth pyjamas up 185%. This is echoed in the online communities building around the topic. On Reddit, the r/Goth community has grown by 35% over the past year to reach 101,000 members, while r/GothStyle had a 136% increase to 115,000 members. The focus this time around has been on personal style and the way it has inspired and been lifted from high fashion, with cyber goths haunting the runway in Balenciaga’s spring-summer 2022 show, Givenchy showcasing 90s teen goths, and Olivier Theyskens taking inspiration from gothic brides. There is also a goth influence on culture more broadly. Taylor Swift’s latest album references folk horror, Willow Smith has a subversive new look, and the 18-year-old singer-songwriter Olivia Rodrigo, who sports a “goth princess” aesthetic, references the goth-adjacent emo subculture of the mid-2000s in her songs. Daniel Rodgers, a fashion and culture writer, said the new goth aesthetic taps into the early noughties revival that has defined youth fashion and culture in recent years. It’s not a return of the “deathly looking goth”, he said, but rather a way to “gesture at subculture more generally” by drawing on a blend of earlier dark style tribes, including emo, punk and strands of goth such as the Camden-inspired cyber-goth look. Rodgers charts the current moment from the eboys and egirls phenomenon of the late 2010s, where young gamers popularised a style that combined elements of goth and emo with Japanese anime and cosplay. He sees this and the current iteration of goth as reflecting the way culture develops in the internet. “We’re in a constant cycle of looking back and reproducing things, spewing up references on to the table, which is like a buffet young people can choose from.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,"Back to black: goths go mainstream in corsets, leather and lace",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/03/back-to-black-goths-go-mainstream-in-corsets-leather-and-lace
1/4/2022,"When then US president Donald Trump caught the coronavirus, Zorawar Sidhu found himself refreshing his phone for updates. Waiting anxiously for the 2020 presidential election result, he was glued to flashing screen again.“My appetite for news had been increased,” the 36-year-old says by phone from New York. “Maybe it’s the frequency of it or the pace of how the information comes in or just how intense every morsel of information is, where the next thing is more alarming than the previous.”  We are all doomscrollers now, compulsively absorbing a constant flow of negative news with untold psychological and social consequences. Sidhu and fellow artist Rob Swainston, who marry historic printing processes with 21st century tools, have responded with works designed to make us stop and regain our footing. Their exhibition of woodblock prints, Doomscrolling, interprets 18 moments between 24 May 2020 and 6 January 2021, a stretch for the history books that saw the coronavirus pandemic, Black Lives Matter protests and deadly insurrection at the US Capitol.The project was born after Sidhu and Swainston found themselves bombarded by images from 2020 and after Swainston took photos of an eerily deserted Manhattan under quarantine during morning bike rides. “It was a very strange sight and everything was empty and all you really saw was this very visible homeless population but everyone else was sort of hiding,” the 51-year-old recalls. “Then, all of a sudden, this plywood started to go up all over lower Manhattan in response to the protests. “I was photographing and I was like, wow, this is such an opportunity for someone who works in print media, and knows the potential of woodblock prints, to get this plywood somehow and use it to tell the story of 2020 on plywood that was put up to ‘protect institutions’. It just seemed so poetic.” The artists contacted various institutions asking if they could have the plywood when it came down and got several positive responses, particularly from the art world. Eventually they collected around 120 sheets. It proved the perfect means of expression, in part because woodblock prints have an association with social change movements going back at least 500 years, in part because the distressed, beaten up material could convey an inherently messy story. Sidhu explains: “In this case, woodcut was the appropriate medium because these prints are made with the paper directly touching the wood, which was outside during these protests and collecting graffiti and was scratched and gouged and drilled into and weathered. All this is still visible when you look up close at those prints.” To create a montage effect, the artists overlaid image upon image, as if scrolling through a computer screen or mobile phone. Sidhu and Swainston used art historical references such as a horse taken from Albrecht Dürer’s The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, hands from Käthe Kollwitz and heavy shadows from Edvard Munch. The 18 prints each represent a specific image or event, including a 24 May New York Times front page “US DEATHS NEAR 100,000, AN INCALCULABLE LOSS” and, a day later, the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, which sparked daily demonstrations against racial injustice in New York and other cities. Swainston, who has an academic background in both art and political science, recalls: “There were images that just circulated and circulated and there were some that in New York City circulated a lot among us and our friends. “I participated in some of the protests that went daily from Prospect Park to McCarren Park in Williamsburg. When the curfew happened, the police started to be aggressive to anyone who was out on the street after seven o’clock and lots of images were passed around. He continues: “Some of these events were very clear that we wanted to do something with, like the day in DC that the parks police gassed everybody and Trump went out and held up the Bible in front of St John’s Church. “There are some other dates that were harder: OK, how do we talk about Covid? Do we look at the dates that have the largest death day? Some of them were a little more nebulous as to what the exact date was but they were feelings that were happening in the time. Social distancing, hospitalisations, memorial images that we just wanted to bring into the series to tell the whole story.” One print focuses on Kyle Rittenhouse, who was 17 when, armed with an AR-style semiautomatic rifle, he shot and killed two people and wounded a third at a protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin. In court, Rittenhouse argued that he fired in self-defence and was acquitted on all charges. But the first piece they finished was the last in chronological order: the storming of the US Capitol in Washington by a pro-Trump mob intent on overturning the election result on 6 January. It felt like a natural bookend. Sidhu explains: “There was an urgency in that moment of January 6 so we all felt that it was time to actually do something about it. For us, as artists, that first thing that we could do was to take that imagery and just get it out, try to do something with it.” Many people, including doomscrolllers, have felt overwhelmed by the past two years. The artists hope to disrupt the idea of these moments as fixed and inevitable. Instead, they argue, their montages keep the moments alive with unfixed meanings, a clue that dialogue and social change are still possible. Sidhu, who was born in Ludhiana, India, says: “It encourages a re-examination of everything that’s happened rather than moving on as if these issues are resolved. We see Covid coming back with Omicron. With the show opening on January 6, it’s already an opportunity to reflect on that date and everything that comes with it.” Swainston adds: “We hope that, by putting it out there, by keeping the images in circulation, they continue to have possibility and don’t just become fixed in the past and we just move on from it. We are still in this moment in my mind and these culture wars that are brewing in the United States that threaten to pull us all apart. “These unresolved issues of race, of gun violence, all of these things we can’t put them behind us and just keep living in them. We need to start to address them and, in our society, it is through images that we are processing information now in a more and more significant way.” The departure of Trump from the White House, and his removal from Twitter, seemed to invite a little less doomscrolling in 2021, but persistent crises including the Omicron variant suggest the phenomenon will not be going away soon. Still, Swainston hopes the exhibition, which opens at the Petzel Gallery on New York’s upper east side on 6 January, can help to wean visitors off their fast food media diet. “We talk about the way that the media environments now are set up to reinforce what you’ve already seen but the way it’s happening is that images get thrown at you and they stack on top of each other, and the next one resonates with the next one. We become very fast in our reading of image; we understand right away. “This is a relatively new thing. The way that humans looked at images in previous environments, they were slower. We would take a long time with a painting or a photo or we would see the pieces first and then the whole. It just has consequences in the way that we look at images.” He adds: “We hope that this series slows people down. This is what you see, but as you’re looking, more and more unfolds, more and more is there, and it gives space for the viewer to continue to look and discover and make up their own mind about what these mean.” Doomscrolling opens on 6 January at the Petzel Gallery in New York",Arts/Art and design,Doomscrolling: the exhibition that visualises our appetite for bad news,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/03/doomscrolling-exhibition-covid-pandemic-new-york
