2/7/2022,"Alifetime of hard work, sacrifice and dedication had culminated in the realisation of a childhood dream, and Jakara Anthony was not quite ready to call it a day. “It’s 5am here and I have not been to bed yet, so it has been a big night,” Australia’s latest Olympic hero said, hours after winning her country’s first gold medal of the Beijing Games. Anthony’s barnstorming victory in the women’s moguls wrote a new chapter in the annals of the country’s sporting history, as the 23-year-old blitzed the rest of the field over two days of competition to break Australia’s 12-year Winter Games gold medal drought.  Anthony, who placed fourth on her Olympic debut four years ago in Pyeongchang, dominated the competition on the slopes of the Zhangjiakou mountains. She led through every round before scoring 83.09 points in the six-woman super final to ensure she entered an exclusive club. Only Steven Bradbury, Alisa Camplin, Dale Begg-Smith, Torah Bright and Lydia Lassila had previously won gold at a Winter Olympics – the last two victories coming as long ago as the 2010 Vancouver Games. “To have gone number one in every round is incredible,” Anthony said. “I know that I’m capable of skiing like that, and I was able to let myself do that and [that’s] something I take a lot of pride in. “When I crossed the line I was like, whatever happens now I’m totally content with, because I was so happy with that run. It was truly my best run on the course and I was really proud of it. I thought I’d done enough [to win gold] … if anyone had beaten that run I would have been so stoked for them, because it would have been a phenomenal run.” Anthony’s win also marked the first time in history that Australia has won more than one medal on the same day of Winter Olympic competition, after Tess Coady picked up a bronze in the women’s snowboard slopestyle earlier on Sunday. Lassila – one of Australia’s greatest Winter Olympians, with a gold and bronze in the women’s aerials to her name – was in tears alongside Camplin – Australia’s assistant chef de mission at these Games – as she paid tribute after the final to Anthony’s resilience and skill. “It was wild, wasn’t it. Because all six of the girls in the super final put down very respect able and solid runs,” Lassila said. “It was a great contest. She did not crumble. She did not falter. She did exactly the same run that she has been doing all week. She just controlled the contest from start to finish. That is what you call pure dominance. It is just so beautiful when you get to witness it like this. It has been a bloody 12-year drought and I’m glad it’s over.” Camplin, also a mentor to Anthony as well as winner of Australia’s second-ever Winter Games gold in 2002, said it was a “special moment”: both for Anthony, and for a nation not used to its athletes standing on the top step of the podium. “She’s just an absolute champion” Camplin said. “She’s worked so hard for this. So steely under pressure. I’m just so incredibly proud. We’ve had amazing people along the way – people that came before me, after me. It sets the standard and also [builds] a lot of love. “There’s a real family magic in this team right now. We really care about each other; it’s not just about the skiing. It’s about being good people and being there for each other through thick and thin, knowing you’re safe no matter what the outcome of the day. It just allows people to fly.” Anthony, from the Victorian coastal town of Barwon Heads, began skiing at the age of four. She made her World Cup debut at 16, before taking her Olympic bow at 19, four years ago. Taking inspiration from teammate Britt Cox, who competed at the Vancouver Games aged just 15, Anthony began to dream of Olympic gold. A silver medal at the 2019 World Championships and three World Cup golds followed, before she came fourth at the 2021 World Championships to set up a run for gold in Beijing. “It was my childhood dream come true and that is something so special,” she said. “I was so lucky to be able to share that with my team there and have everybody back home watching it and it was just an incredible experience. “It has taken a lot of work and there have been a lot of really tough times, but the processes that we have put in place and have really committed to solidifying have really shown to come through with the goods.”",Sport/Sport,Gold medal puts Jakara Anthony in exclusive Australian club after realising childhood Olympic dream,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/07/jakara-anthony-gold-medal-exclusive-australia-club-win-mogul-run-beijing-winter-olympics-2022
2/7/2022,"The Māori party of New Zealand has called for a “divorce” from the crown and removal of the British royal family as New Zealand’s head of state. The call came on the 182nd anniversary of the signing of the treaty of Waitangi, or Te Tiriti o Waitangi, New Zealand’s foundational legal document.  “If you look at our founding covenant as a marriage between tangata whenua [indigenous people] and the crown, then Te Tiriti is the child of that marriage. It’s time [for] tangata whenua to take full custody,” Māori Pāti co-leader Rawiri Waititi said. “This won’t mean the crown is off the hook. If a couple gets divorced, you don’t lose responsibility for your child. This will be an opportunity to reimagine a more meaningful and fulfilling partnership,” he said. Past pushes for New Zealand to become a republic has struggled to gain momentum. Polling from Colmar Brunton in 2021 found a third of New Zealanders wanted to cut ties with the monarchy, while 47% did not and 20% did not know. The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has said she is a republican, and in 2021 she said she believed New Zealand would become a republic in her lifetime – but that she would not take action on it during her term. Speaking at the announcement of governor general Cindy Kiro, Ardern said she had had ​ “never sensed urgency” from the public to make it happen. “I’ve been very clear that despite being a republican, I’m not of the view that in the here-and-now … this is something New Zealanders feel particularly strongly about,” she said. “I don’t know that I’ve had one person actually raise with me generally day-to-day the issue of becoming a republic. This government has prioritised those issues that we do see as a priority. But I do still think there will be a time and a place; I just don’t see it as now.” The call for removing the Queen as head of state is a shift in policy for the Māori party, which in 2017 objected to calls for a republic from within Labour. “Removing the Queen as our head of state removes the treaty of Waitangi and Māori rights in this country guaranteed to us under our nation’s founding document,” then-leader Te Ururoa Flavell said at the time. “Given our colonial history and the systematic stripping away of Māori land, rights and resource, any talk about cutting ties with the Queen, or establishing a republic is an extremely naive move.” Under current leadership, the Māori party holds two seats in New Zealand’s parliament, and is pushing for constitutional reform in New Zealand, including the establishment of a Māori parliament. “The only way this nation can work is when Māori assert their rights to self-management, self-determination and self-governance over all our domains. Our vision is for constitutional transformation that restores the tino rangatiratanga [full sovereignty] of tangata whenua in this country,” co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer said.",News/World news,New Zealand Māori party calls for a ‘divorce’ from Britain’s royal family,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/07/new-zealand-maori-party-calls-for-a-divorce-from-britains-royal-family
2/7/2022,"Facebook has lost a major battle with the Australian regulator over the Cambridge Analytica scandal, after a court dismissed the social media giant’s claim that it neither conducts business nor collects personal information in the country. The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) is suing Facebook, now Meta, for breaching the privacy of more than 300,000 Australian Facebook users in the Cambridge Analytica scandal, exposed more than four years ago by the Guardian.  Throughout the 2010s, consulting firm Cambridge Analytica harvested the personal data of millions of Facebook users without their consent using a personality test app called This is Your Digital Life. The information was then used predominantly for political advertising, including to assist the Brexit campaign and Donald Trump. Only 53 people in Australia installed the This is Your Digital Life app, according to court documents, but it was able to harvest the data of about 311,127 people. The OAIC was slow to launch a case against Facebook for the privacy breaches compared with other jurisdictions, announcing proceedings in 2020 in the federal court, where it alleged “serious and/or repeated interferences with privacy in contravention of Australian privacy law”. It sought to sue the parent company Facebook Inc, based in the US, and its Irish subsidiary, Facebook Ireland Limited. Facebook Inc has since attempted to have the case against it effectively thrown out, arguing it does not carry out business or collect or hold personal information in Australia, so it cannot be sued under the country’s privacy laws. The full bench of the federal court on Monday threw out the argument, describing parts of Facebook’s case as “divorced from reality”. It found the social media giant’s installation of cookies on the physical devices of Australian users was enough to show it was carrying out business in Australia. “There is a readily available inference that Facebook Inc installs cookies on devices in Australia on behalf of Facebook Ireland as part of its business of providing data processing services to it,” justice Nye Perram said in his reasons. “Further, it is clear that Facebook Ireland’s use of cookies (installed and removed by Facebook Inc) forms an important part of the operation of the Facebook platform. “It is not an outlier activity. It is one of the things ‘which makes Facebook work’.” The court also rejected Facebook’s argument that such a finding would “open the floodgates”, by assuming any website that is accessible in Australia is carrying on business in Australia. “The menace of opened floodgates from which Facebook Inc was commendably keen to protect the Australian legal system, is in my view very much overstated,” Perram said. The court was also scathing of a comparison by Facebook of its business to the process of sending mail by post. Facebook said that what had happened in this case was that its datacentres had transmitted digital signals to user devices, and that this transmission had brought about a change to the digital state of those devices. This was likened to the act of sending a letter from overseas to Australia, which prompted its reader to do something that had an economic impact. This, the company said, could never be construed as the sender having conducted business in Australia. “The problems with this submission are first that it proves far too much, and secondly that it is, with respect, divorced from reality,” the court ruled. “It proves too much because it has the consequence that no computer-based activity in one jurisdiction can ever amount to more than an effect in computers located in another.” The full bench’s decision confirms an earlier ruling made by federal court justice Thomas Thawley and follows an appeal by Facebook. The OAIC said in a statement that it welcomed the court’s decision and now looked forward to the hearing of the case proper. Meta said it was reviewing the ruling and had no immediate comment.",News/Technology,Facebook appeal over Cambridge Analytica data rejected by Australian court as ‘divorced from reality’,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/07/facebook-appeal-over-cambridge-analytica-data-rejected-by-australian-court-as-divorced-from-reality
