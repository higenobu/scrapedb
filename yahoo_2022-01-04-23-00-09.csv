1/4/2022,"A deputy district attorney and up-and-coming Republican political star in California’s Orange County has died abruptly after telling friends she contracted COVID-19. Kelly Ernby, a presumed candidate for the state Assembly in 2022, was only 46 years old. According to the Los Angeles Times, she fell ill shortly after speaking out against vaccine mandates at a rally organized by Turning Point USA on Dec. 4. “There’s nothing that matters more than our freedoms right now,” she was quoted telling the crowd during the rally at Irvine City Hall. It was not immediately clear where or how she contracted the virus. Her death has sparked an outpouring of tributes from colleagues who praised her for her passion and experience. Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer devoted a lengthy Twitter thread to Ernby on Monday, calling her “an incredibly vibrant and passionate attorney who cared deeply about the work that we do as prosecutors—and deeply about the community we all fight so hard to protect.” “It was an absolute privilege to fight the good fight alongside Kelly,” Spitzer wrote. “Her passion and her shining light will be forever missed.” “My heart is broken and I'm in tears. I lost a dear friend to Covid complications. I love you @KellyErnby ! You’ve been nothing but an inspiration to many of us here in Orange County,” Ben Chapman, chairman of the Greater Costa Mesa Republicans, wrote on Twitter, alongside a photo of himself and Ernby. The Orange County Republicans, for whom Ernby had served as the precinct operations chair, said news of her death had caused “great sadness.” The group noted only that Ernby had died unexpectedly after a “brief illness,” saying “we have hope in this tragedy because we know she had a deep faith.” The daughter of two Navy veterans, Ernby had nearly two decades of legal experience and had run for state Assembly in 2020, with her campaign focusing on border security, and “conservative values in California,” among other things. “Kelly and I spent a lot of time together on the campaign trail in 2020. She was one of the few people in politics that always came across as real, authentic, caring and passionate,” Brian Burley, a Republican who ran for Congress last cycle, tweeted of her political talent. While she had publicly expressed opposition to COVID-19 vaccine mandates, it was not immediately clear if she herself was inoculated against the virus. Read more at The Daily Beast.

1/4/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Greg Pence watched the Jan. 6 insurrection unfold from an extraordinary perch. As chants of “Hang Mike Pence” echoed in the Capitol, the Republican congressman from Indiana and his better-known brother were whisked away from the Senate by the Secret Service shortly before a mob of Donald Trump supporters burst in, intent on stopping the vice president from certifying Democrat Joe Biden's win. Their dramatic escape, caught on security cameras, came minutes after Trump excoriated Mike Pence on Twitter for lacking the “courage” to use his ceremonial post presiding over the certification of the 2020 election to overturn its outcome. “My brother was being asked to do what we don’t do in this country,” Greg Pence recounted at a Republican fundraising dinner in his district last July, one of the rare instances he has spoken publicly about the attack. He later added, “I couldn’t be prouder.” At the beating heart of the insurrection lies Trump’s attempt to pressure his vice president to take the unprecedented step of overturning the election. And few had a better vantage point on the day of the attack than Greg Pence, who watched the certification proceedings from the Senate gallery, then joined his younger brother in a private office off the Senate chamber when chaos broke out. They were evacuated, along with other members of the Pence family, to a secure area, where the vice president worked the phone, pleading for help to clear rioters from the building. That makes Greg Pence a tantalizing prospective witness for the House Jan. 6 committee, which is investigating the origins of the insurrection that Trump fomented when he urged his supporters to march on the Capitol and “fight like hell.” Pence has largely declined to discuss what transpired while he was with his brother that day, other than praising his brother as a hero for standing up to Trump. His silence serves as powerful evidence of the grip that Trump still holds on his party, which has led many Republicans to dispute the seriousness of the attack and instead perpetuate the lie that Trump was wrongly denied a second term. Pence declined last month to speak with The Associated Press at the Capitol. A spokesperson did not respond to multiple inquiries seeking comment. First elected to Congress in 2018, 65-year-old Greg Pence represents a deeply Republican and largely rural district that his brother held for 12 years before he was elected Indiana governor and eventually selected by Trump to become vice president. Unlike his brother, who from a young age was fixated on a career in politics, Greg Pence was always an unlikely congressman. After graduating from Loyola University in Chicago, he joined the Marines and later fell into a series of petroleum industry jobs. He eventually served as president of Kiel Bros., a Midwest gas station empire his father helped build, a post he resigned from in 2004 after the company filed for bankruptcy and saddled the state of Indiana with more than $21 million in unpaid environmental cleanup costs, a 2018 Associated Press investigation found. Pence turned his focus in 2006 to operating antique malls he purchased with his wife, Denise, a business now worth between $5 million and $25 million, according to his congressional financial disclosure. When Mike Pence's former congressional seat opened up in 2018, his brother ran a stealthy campaign. Granting few interviews and ducking debates, he coasted to victory. “I looked into the mirror and said, ‘If not me, who?’” Greg Pence told his hometown newspaper, The Columbus Republic, in a rare interview during the campaign. But he also expressed deep ambivalence about the job, as well as a lack of conviction that would likely have doomed other candidates. “What would be my positions, what would be my focus?” he said in a September 2017 interview with the Washington Examiner, a conservative publication, before formally launching his campaign. “I really haven’t dug into or formed positions on anything yet.” Since then, Pence has had a muted presence in Congress, where he serves on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Yet during the Trump administration, he enjoyed rarefied privileges, riding with the president on Air Force One for campaign and administration events where the president name-checked him. One area in which he has excelled is fundraising, raising far more money than the average first-term member of Congress. Pence also has enjoyed the trappings of political life, spending over $49,000 at Trump-owned properties, while paying Trump's pollster $137,000 during his 2018 race when there was little doubt he would win, campaign finance disclosures show. Pence and his family also have collected money from his campaign account, including $18,000 in rent paid to the company he runs with his wife, and $35,000 paid to his daughter Nicole, a former TV reporter, who advised his 2018 campaign. He has also collected $57,000 in reimbursements for travel and meals, records show. For months it was unclear whether the committee would even seek interviews with members of Congress connected to the insurrection, which was viewed as a provocative step. But in late December, the committee announced it wanted to interview Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, a staunch Trump ally, as well as Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, who leads the hard-line House Freedom Caucus. So far, Democrats who serve on the committee have been tight-lipped about whether Greg Pence could be called for an interview or asked to submit documents. ""I'm not going to talk about any individual being called,"" said Rep. Pete Aguilar, a California Democrat on the committee, when asked whether an interview with Pence would be sought. Pence has repeatedly voted against attempts to shed light on the insurrection, or hold those who urged it on accountable. He voted twice against forming a committee to investigate the origins of the attack, calling it “bass-ackwards.” He also voted against impeaching Trump. But perhaps the most significant vote was in the immediate aftermath of the attack. Hours after emerging from a secure location, Mike Pence gaveled the joint session of Congress back in and presided over the certification of the election, despite Trump's demands. Greg Pence, meanwhile, joined scores of other Republicans who sided with Trump and cast a vote rejecting the outcome in Pennsylvania, the state that clinched the election for Biden.",Politics/Associated Press,Jan. 6 attack posed loyalty test for Indiana Rep.

1/4/2022,"Florida's Jackson Health System said half its COVID patients were admitted for ""non-COVID reasons."" These types of patients test positive for the coronavirus after being admitted. Catching COVID-19 can make preexisting conditions worse in the hospital, experts have warned. About half of the patients listed as being in the hospital with COVID-19 were admitted for ""non-COVID reasons,"" a health authority in Florida said. ""Jackson Health System hospitals currently have 439 patients who have tested positive for COVID-19,"" the Jackson Health System said in a tweet on Monday. ""Of those, 220 patients — or 50% — are admitted to the hospital primarily for non-COVID reasons."" The post was a relatively rare snapshot of the prevalence of so-called incidental COVID in the US. Anthony Fauci, the White House chief medical advisor, recently warned that COVID-19 hospitalization data should be taken with a grain of salt, Insider previously reported. He said in a Wednesday interview that focused on admissions in children, that some would be admitted for ""a broken leg, or appendicitis, or something like that,"" and only later turn out to have COVID-19. COVID-19 cases like that can make up a substantial proportion of hospital admissions. These made up about a third of the 8,321 COVID-positive cases in England on December 28, according to data from the UK National Health Service. In separate press conferences on Monday, New York Gov. Katy Hochul and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that incidental cases could be making up a good proportion of hospitalized cases their states. ""Beginning tomorrow, we're going to be asking all hospitals to break out for us how many people are being hospitalized because of COVID symptoms [and] how many people … happen to be testing positive,"" Hochul said. Experts have warned against underestimating COVID-19 hospitalization data because of these incidental cases. Mark Kline, Senior Vice President of the Children's hospital in New Orleans, said in a tweet that last summer ""78% of 915 kids"" at six hospitals were hospitalized ""not just with, but because of COVID."" He didn't name the hospitals in question. Having COVID-19 can also worsen whatever problem the person was admitted for, said David Strain, a senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter medical school, in an interview with The Guardian. ""We [have] seen many other people who have been otherwise stable [with] chronic diseases such as heart failure, ulcerative colitis etc that caught COVID and had a rapid deterioration,"" he said. ""Although they are regarded as 'incidental Covid', this sudden deterioration in otherwise stable disease can be attributed to the virus,"" he said.
