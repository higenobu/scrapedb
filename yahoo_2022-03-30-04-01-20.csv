3/30/2022,"Anil Ambani’s debt-ridden firm Reliance Capital has evoked interest from several quarters, including the 150-year old Tata Group, coal billionaire Gautam Adani’s group, and Yes Bank. Promoted by the Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG), it is one of India’s largest diversified financial services companies and has reportedly received 54 bids in all till now, news agency Press Trust of India has reported. The skinny jean is officially dead Reliance Capital is currently under corporate insolvency resolution. Last November, the Reserve Bank of India superseded its board in view of “payment defaults and serious governance issues.” Like the other firms under the ADAG umbrella, Reliance Capital is an apparent victim of a financial crunch caused by Anil Ambani’s constantly-deteriorating wealth.

The others are Srei Group NBFC and Dewan Housing Finance Corporation. In September 2021, the Anil Ambani-led firm informed its shareholders that its consolidated debt was 40,000 crore rupees. It reported narrowing its consolidated net loss to Rs1,759 crore in the quarter ended December 2021.
