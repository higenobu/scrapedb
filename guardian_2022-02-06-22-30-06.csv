2/6/2022,"The thrill of reality TV has always been its escapism. Lately, though, I have been gobbling up a new crop of BBC reality shows, such as Ibiza Dreams and Inside Dubai: Playground of the Rich, which seem less about escapism than offering British people an exit plan. A similar story will become the basis for the upcoming BBC show Dubai Hustle, in which 20-something Britons compete to sell Dubai real estate. The contestants’ desperation to escape the UK’s “bleak employment prospects” – as the programme’s promotional material puts it – is being deployed to raise the TV stakes. The dream these shows are selling is expatriation: to physically escape (preferably for ever) the UK. Dubbed “aspirational” within the TV industry, the programmes follow UK citizens who swap underpaid jobs in British supermarkets and call centres to pursue glamorous careers in places such as Dubai and Ibiza. In Inside Dubai, the BBC makes no mention of the city state’s well-documented use of slave labour, preferring to paint it as an Oz-like land of milk and honey – a place where you can hire a servant, or drink a cappuccino decorated with a foamy picture of your own face. A place where, if you are a clever expat, you can make tax-free millions doing strange and wonderful things such as selling truffles, or organising birthday parties for dogs.  The appetite for this type of programming reflects a very real lack of opportunity for young people in the UK, where 22% of 16- to 24-year-olds live in poverty , and high inflation means real wages are falling. What is striking about these shows is that they repackage that sense of hopelessness about UK employment prospects, and sell it as inspirational lifestyle TV. In Ibiza Dreams, we follow a group of Gen Z-ers as they try to become influencers, or “naked butlers”, or sell pictures of their feet online. This is really a story of economic precarity, about people born too late to experience security or progression in traditional industries, but it is told with a kind of relentless positivity. Even when the naked butler has to tell his own father he has started selling nudes for cash, it is framed as a canny business opportunity: “If you’ve got it, flaunt it.” “Hustle culture” – the conviction that if you flaunt, and sweat, and graft enough, you can pull yourself up by sheer effort of will – is everywhere in these programmes. At points, the “hustle” is elevated into a kind of spiritual practice. In Ibiza Dreams, three would-be digital nomads downward dog at dawn in preparation for a hard day’s graft, and there is a lot of talk about the only barrier to success being “taking that mental block out”. A cursory glance at any ex-Love Islander’s Instagram reveals a similar faith in the power of said Love Islander’s mind to somehow commune with the universe and garner great wealth and happiness. Georgia Louise Harrison, a 2017 alumna of the programme with 1.1m Instagram followers, regularly posts about how “thoughts become things” – an idea popularised by the 2006 self-help book The Secret, which told readers that manifesting a new reality was “exactly like placing an order from a catalogue”. Last week, it was announced that people on universal credit would be given just four weeks (down from three months) to find a job within their preferred sector. After that, claimants would be forced to take any job going – whether or not it’s beneath their qualification – or face having their benefits slashed. This means that unless you have family money or are already a high earner, that fantasy job is just getting further out of reach. Ibiza Dreams was filmed in 2019 but aired more than a year later, and watching the nomads and butlers chase the lives they want from a 2022 vantage point is moving. Daring to dream that you have some control over your circumstances is oddly courageous – particularly as the pandemic has only exacerbated dismal employment prospects for young people, with one in three 18- to 34-year-olds returning to atypical, often insecure work, and the number of economically inactive young men increasing by almost 50,000 since last spring, according to new data from the Resolution Foundation. There have been points over the past two years when it has felt like we were in the grips of an existential reckoning about the role of work in our lives. Resignations and job-to-job moves in the UK were at their highest in 20 years, according to a report by the UK Labour Force Survey (LFS), and there were tenuous hopes that workers – inspired by the experience of furlough – might be abandoning the culture of productivity in favour of a new relationship with work and leisure, one that privileged time over money. But the hunger for shows like Dubai Hustle and Inside Dubai, which drew audiences of more than 2 million a episode, suggests a different story, one in which the spectacle of excess still functions as a bizarre appeasement for inequality, and Britons – crushed by the erosion of the welfare state and the rising cost of living – dream of fleeing the country. Of side-hustling away every spare hour and minute in the hope of a better life. I saw a TikTok video a couple of weeks ago sincerely lamenting the death of the 9-5. In the post, which has received more than 200,000 likes since it was uploaded, @dawnpark rejects the pressure of hustle culture, with its compulsion to “make a living travelling and become financially free by the age of 30 etc”. It is interesting to me that to Gen Z, an eight-hour work day looks like a quaint, cosy relic from a kindlier age. The wheel has turned full circle. Perhaps the best we can hope for is a return to the 9-5.

2/6/2022,"The Prince of Wales has paid tribute to his “darling wife” the Duchess of Cornwall for her “steadfast support” after the Queen announced that Camilla will be known as “Queen Consort” when Charles becomes king. In a statement released on Sunday, Charles heralded the Queen for the way her “devotion to the welfare of all her people inspires still greater admiration with each passing year”.  Elizabeth II, who has become the first British monarch in history to celebrate 70 years on the throne, used her momentous milestone to issue her royal seal of approval for Camilla to become Queen Camilla. In an intervention that shapes the future of the monarchy, the Queen expressed her “sincere wish” that Camilla be known as Queen Consort when the Prince of Wales becomes King, and called on the public to support them both. Charles, in a written message marking the Queen’s milestone Accession Day anniversary, said he and Camilla were “deeply conscious” of the honour. “On this historic day, my wife and I join you all in congratulating Her Majesty the Queen on the remarkable achievement of serving this nation, the realms and Commonwealth for 70 years,” the prince said. “We are deeply conscious of the honour represented by my mother’s wish. “As we have sought together to serve and support Her Majesty and the people of our communities, my darling wife has been my own steadfast support throughout. “The year of this unprecedented platinum jubilee brings an opportunity for us all to come together in celebrating the service of the Queen, by whose example we will continue to be led in the years to come.” The Queen is paving the way for her daughter-in-law to be crowned at Charles’s side on his coronation day. The Queen, who came to the throne when she was 25, chose to spend her accession day privately on the Sandringham estate in remembrance of her father, George VI, whose death marked the start of her reign. National celebrations marking the Queen’s record-breaking service on the throne will be staged during a four-day bank holiday weekend from 2 June to 5 June.",News/UK news,Prince Charles pays tribute to ‘darling wife’ and future Queen Camilla,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/06/prince-charles-pays-tribute-to-darling-wife-and-future-queen-camilla
2/6/2022,"East Side Voices boasts contributions from a dazzling range of east Asian and south-east Asian public figures, from Eternals actor Gemma Chan to model Naomi Shimada. It grew out of a salon convened by the book’s editor – and acting deputy editor of Harper’s Bazaar – Helena Lee in February 2020, just before the pandemic that Donald Trump branded the “China virus” and “Kung flu”, fuelling a wave of racist violence against east and south-east Asian people. The anthology describes instances of racism in all its forms: crude vilification, sexualised exoticism, entitlement, self-righteous ignorance and insularity. But it also reaches back through centuries of colonisation, exploitation and migration and reminds us that in the sweep of human history, there is often no fixed motherland and no fixed resting place.  Many pieces reference meagre cultural representation and insulting stereotypes in TV and film, such as the contribution by Katie Leung, the Glaswegian actor cast as Cho Chang in the Harry Potter films. A private school rebel turned art school cool girl, Leung is as far from the cringing, sniffling Cho Chang as it’s possible to be. Yet her success is racialised: “I was not considered [for roles] unless race came into it.” All the anthology contributors are incredibly successful: society’s winners, global third-culture kids. As Chinese-Malaysian novelist Tash Aw writes poetically“: “We revel in the three-dimensional nature of our hybrid cultures and languages, rejoicing in the fact that we have an instinctive understanding of how the south-east Asian archipelago weaves its cultural connections.” Yet many of the testimonials demonstrate that no amount of privilege protects you from the racism of others. The essays are sharpest when various forms of objectification intersect – for example when sexual and racial abuse combine, as with novelist Sharlene Teo’s excellent, self-lacerating piece on exotification: “Once, a man followed me down a platform at Paddington station, chanting ‘ni hao, konnichiwa, sexy sexy’ and I told him to get lost – only for him to start shouting and running after me.” The most powerful and disturbing piece is by novelist Claire Kohda, who describes her philistine English grandmother’s treatment of her: “When my cousins once visited my nan and grandad at the same time as me and my parents, they received little bags of sweets and chocolates, while I sat and watched empty-handed from a corner of the room.” The piece centres on a portrait her grandmother paints, in which Kohda’s features (her mother is Japanese) are whitewashed. The strength of this slim collection is in its nuance. Many essays do not speak just of racist stereotypes or attacks, but also of internal conflicts, self-censorship, self-disavowal, embarrassment and shame, of initially pushing away questions of heritage and identity. East Side Voices is a thoughtful, painful reminder of the grand narratives that get buried under belittling stereotypes, of how progress can also regress and how self-actualisation, self-discovery and personal excellence still grate against the perceptions of strangers.

2/6/2022,"The fourth Jackass movie sees franchise co-creator Johnny Knoxville and his merry men gleefully reunited to document one final array of puerile practical jokes. There are bodily fluids and much bashing between the legs of the cast members, who are now in their 50s. Yet the hit rate of gags is admirably high: a human ramp (exactly what it sounds like) and a set piece involving a pitch-dark room and a snake in a bucket are straightforwardly funny and, for the most part, blissfully low-stakes.  There’s no plot, just a string of pranks, but watching them in succession is not quite the same numbing experience as bingeing on TikToks or YouTube videos.

2/6/2022,"After a decade of ceaseless experimentation and genre hopping, Animal Collective finally struck gold with 2009’s Merriweather Post Pavilion. One of that decade’s finest albums, its dense, complex rhythms were overlaid with psychedelic textures and – crucially – inspired pop nous. But having delivered a masterpiece, they seemed not to know how to follow it: 2012’s Centipede Hz and 2016’s Painting With were an awkward mix of innovation and irritating, self-conscious wackiness. In one respect, Time Skiffs, their first album proper in six years (the less said about 2018’s woeful collaboration with Coral Morphologic the better), is a step forward in that there is nothing to set one’s teeth on edge, the vocals of Panda Bear and Avey Tare working together this time, as opposed to against each other, one of Painting With’s most distressing developments. Equally, however, there is precious little to fall back in love with. The rare kernels of genuine inspiration tend to be buried beneath so many awkwardly assembled layers and stop-start arrangements that they get lost; the disjointed Prester John began life as two songs and it shows; the plodding Royal and Desire is actively dispiriting.  Every so often, the disparate parts coalesce into something enjoyable: We Go Back and Dragon Slayer both exhibit a lovely playfulness. Stretched over 48 minutes, though, there’s the sense that for all its undoubted cleverness, Time Skiffs is not terribly easy to warm to.",Arts/Music,Animal Collective: Time Skiffs review – clever but not easy to love,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/06/animal-collective-time-skiffs-review-clever-but-not-easy-to-love
2/6/2022,"What did Vincent van Gogh look like? Only one photograph of the artist exists, and in it he’s unrecognisable. At 19, the beard has not yet appeared; the familiar inverted triangle of his skull still goes incognito beneath the fleshiness of youth. Later, several of his friends would make portraits of him. But if we know him by his bristles in their pictures, he’s still several kinds of man. Toulouse-Lautrec casts him in pastel with the far-off look of the absinthe drinker. In Pissarro’s sketch, in which he sits beside his top-hatted brother, Theo, he is almost (but not quite) the dandy. Gauguin famously has him at his easel, the sunflowers beside him doing nothing whatsoever to ease his mood, which is downcast, shuttered against the world. “It’s me all right, but me gone mad,” he is supposed to have said, on first seeing it.  Perhaps the better question, then, is to ask how Van Gogh saw himself – though it’s surely no easier to answer. At the Courtauld’s wondrous new exhibition, where a collection of the artist’s self-portraits are gathered together as if in a family album, the atmosphere is uncanny almost beyond description. A ghostliness is abroad in these rooms: here are the “apparitions” of which Van Gogh writes in his letters, the “modern” portrait having in his eyes more to do with a lingering vitality than with any photographic resemblance. But the eerie mood is cut with a clarity that goes through it like a knife. Have spectres ever been so corporeal, their bones, their flesh and even the colours of their eyes so infinitely varied? Each time Van Gogh looked in the mirror, a different creature rose up before him, with the result that you might be in the company not of one man, but of a small crowd: a band of brothers. Only the fox-red hair gives the game away. That, and the feeling that this work represents some of those rare moments when, for the artist, “the veil of time and fatality of circumstances seemed to be torn apart for an instant”; that you are, in other words, in the presence of greatness. The exhibition’s curator, Karen Serres, is keen to dispel the notion that Van Gogh’s self-portraits are displays of raw emotion. They are, she believes, as much demonstrations of technique as they are depictions of mood; the artist was his own best (and cheapest) model, and beyond this, and the details of where this or that picture was painted, she doesn’t say much. I strongly favour this approach, and not only because one tires of the now highly commercialised mythology, all mutilated ears and laminated coasters. It was Van Gogh’s mental health – a madness that would descend like darkness – that stopped him from working; when he was painting, he was never, he felt, more sane. Nevertheless, these works reveal all sorts of signs of extreme feeling. Van Gogh used a brilliant metaphor to explain the relationship between his art and his illness: knowing it could strike again at any time spurred him on, he said, “to seriousness, as a miner who is always in danger makes haste in what he does”. It’s not feverishness, exactly, that we detect here. He’s too deft for that, and too innovative; he’s a minimalist in the sense that he knows just when to stop. But it is intense, this conviction (in his talent) that sometimes flickers, and sometimes blazes. It’s not only his eyes, as deep-set as boreholes, that bring to mind a sense of excavation. There are 37 surviving self-portraits, all of which were made between the spring of 1886 and the early autumn of 1889 (Van Gogh killed himself, aged 37, in July 1890). This exhibition has 16 of them, as well as two other pictures from 1888: Van Gogh’s Chair, in which the artist is represented by his pipe and tobacco pouch, and Portrait of Eugene Boch, in which he depicts the Belgian painter against a starry sky (“I paint the infinite”), giving his friend the appreciation, the understanding, even the love he must often have craved for himself. For the Courtauld, this is a great coup: here are some stunning loans. This is the first time in more than 130 years that two self-portraits of 1889, made when Van Gogh was in a psychiatric hospital (an asylum, as he would have known it) in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, have been reunited. Painted only a week apart, the contrast between them is dramatic, completely gob-smacking. In the first, Van Gogh’s skin is yellow-green; there’s something feral about his expression, as if he were a sickly field mouse that has spied a particularly vigorous stoat. In the second, the light has come in. We see his brushes. He’s working, and the luxuriant folds of his smock suggest renewed energy. Art, Van Gogh’s most precious balm (“it fortifies the will and consequently allows these mental weaknesses less hold”), has performed its magic once again. I spent more time with these two works than with all the others combined. Taken together, there is something indomitable about them, and it does the soul good to see it. But there’s fascination at every turn: the colours, the brushstrokes, the magnificent forehead. The earliest painting, Self-Portrait with Felt Hat (1886-87), comes with a whiff of the drawing room: the artist looks so serious, so bourgeois. But in Self-Portrait with Straw Hat (1887), made only a few months later, he appears before us like some old prog rocker decked out for his latest album cover. Thinking about these pictures as a group, the obvious comparison – and the curator makes it – is with Van Gogh’s idol, Rembrandt (though his self-portraits were produced over decades). But I was put in mind of the Finnish artist Helene Schjerfbeck. It’s to do with scale, experimentation and, above all, a certain self-tenderness: a kindly honesty in the matter of what the eyes see. And there’s something else, too. Like the show of Schjerfbeck’s self-portraits at the Royal Academy in 2019, the Courtauld’s exhibition is small, staged over just two rooms. You could not possibly describe it – though there will be crowds – as a blockbuster, and for me this is one of the best things about it. You will want, sometimes, to wrestle these great pictures from their heavy frames, as if releasing a prisoner from a cell. But this is an exhibition that wholly defies the terrible paradox of museum-going, which is that, in the case of very famous artists, it induces a kind of blindness. The eye is unharried, the legs are never weary. You have the time truly to see these pictures. Van Gogh and his inferno of a talent are palpable. For the rest of the day, your heart beats out a rhapsody.

2/6/2022,"Playing with dolls encourages children to talk more about others’ thoughts and emotions, a study has found. The research suggests that playing imaginary games with dolls could help children develop social skills, theory of mind and empathy. The neuroscientist who led the work said that while the educational value of playing with Lego and construction toys was widely accepted, the benefits of playing with dolls sometimes appeared to have been overlooked.  “When children create imaginary worlds and role play with dolls, they communicate at first out loud and then internalise the message about others’ thoughts, emotions and feelings,” said Dr Sarah Gerson, a neuroscientist at Cardiff University and the lead author. “This can have positive long-lasting effects on children, such as driving higher rates of social and emotional processing and building social skills like empathy that can become internalised to build and form lifelong habits.” The study, funded by the manufacturers of Barbie and published in the journal Developmental Science, had 33 boys and girls, aged between four and eight, who were given a collection of Barbie dolls and accessories, such as an ambulance or horse, to play with. While they were left to play spontaneously, their speech was monitored and they were also fitted with a specialised cap containing a form of brain imaging technology called functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The technique measures changes in blood oxygenation by shining light through the skull, which makes it possible to track brain activity while the subject is freely moving around. The study found that the children talked more about others’ thoughts and emotions, a concept known as internal state language, when playing with the dolls, compared with playing creative games on a computer tablet, such as a hairdressing game or a city-building game with characters. They were also more likely to address the dolls in the second person, talking to them directly, whereas the characters on the computer screen they tended to refer to in the third person. No difference was observed between boys and girls. “Internal state language can indicate that a child is thinking about other people’s thoughts and emotions while playing with dolls,” said Gerson. Benjamin Mardell, who researches the pedagogy of play at Harvard Graduate School of Education and who was not involved in the work, said: “The hypothesis that playing with dolls provides a scaffolding for young children to take the perspective of another, even if that other is inanimate, seems very reasonable. And that they see language use in this regard is good confirmation of the hypothesis.” Mardell added that the findings ought to apply to any kind of role-play toy, rather than being specific to Barbies. “I’d take a broader view of what a doll is,” he said. “[It could be] any object that the child can invest a sense of other into – a stuffed animal, an oven mitt that talks to them, or even an imaginary friend.” Children typically start to show signs of internal state language around the age of four. At this age, they begin to voice their thoughts aloud, indicating that they are considering the thoughts, feelings and desires of themselves and others. “These skills are really important for interacting with other people, learning from other people, and navigating a variety of social situations,” Gerson said. “It becomes important for making and sustaining friendships, and how they learn from their teachers, and parents.” The study also found that the children had increased brain activity in the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) region when they spoke as though their dolls had thoughts and feelings. The pSTS region is believed to be involved in the development of social and emotional processing skills.",News/Society,"Playing with dolls helps children talk about how others feel, says study",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/06/playing-dolls-helps-children-talk-about-how-others-feel-study
2/6/2022,"Germany is preparing to send reinforcements to its battlegroup in Lithuania as the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, headed to Washington to reassure Nato allies of its solidarity over the Ukraine crisis. Tentative planning for a further deployment of German military force follows weeks of criticism of Berlin’s approach to Russia’s mobilisation of 145,000 troops on its border with Ukraine.  Berlin has refused to act on Kyiv’s calls for arms and has been vague over the future of the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany in the event of an incursion over the Ukrainian border. But the German government will go on a diplomatic blitz this week, with Scholz due at the White House on Monday and Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, expected in Ukraine on Monday and Tuesday, where she will inspect the frontline between Ukrainian troops and areas held by Russian-based separatists. Following his meeting with the US president, Joe Biden, Scholz will welcome heads of state and government of the Baltic states in Berlin on Thursday to discuss the security situation in eastern Europe. Scholz, who took over from Angela Merkel in December, is due to visit Ukraine and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, at the Kremlin on 14 and 15 February. In an interview with the Funke media group, Germany’s defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, emphasised her government’s military commitment on Nato’s eastern flank. “We [Germany] are already making a very important contribution in Lithuania, where we are the only country in the European Union to have a battlegroup,” she said. “As a matter of principle, additional troops are available as reinforcement, and we are in talks with Lithuania at the moment to find out what exactly would make sense in this regard … Everyone in Nato can rely on us.” Since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, there have been four battlegroups containing a total of 5,000 troops in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland led by the US, Germany, Canada and Britain. Germany provides about half of the 1,200 Nato troops in Lithuania. The US has ordered a further 3,000 extra troops to strengthen Nato’s eastern allies, with the first arriving on Saturday at Rzeszow military base in south-eastern Poland. In her interview published on Sunday, Lambrecht defended Germany’s negative response to a request from Kyiv for missile defence systems, tools for electronic warfare, night-vision goggles, digital radios, radar stations and military ambulances. The German government has been widely mocked for instead sending 5,000 protective helmets and a field hospital. Lambrecht said: “It has long been the clear stance of the federal government, even in previous legislative periods, that we do not deliver weapons to crisis areas in order not to escalate further there. “In the Ukraine conflict we have negotiating partners who have come back to the negotiating table … That is why it is now our task to de-escalate. We want to resolve this conflict peacefully.” Scholz has said the future of Nord Stream 2 will be on the table as part of a package of economic sanctions in the event of a Russian incursion of Ukrainian territory but he has been shy of making any stronger statements in public. Last week, Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, appeared to follow the US administration’s lead in trying to box Berlin in on the issue. “Nord Stream 2 cannot be excluded from the sanctions list, that is very clear,” she said.",News/World news,Ukraine: Germany to beef up Lithuania force as Scholz begins diplomatic blitz,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/06/ukraine-germany-to-beef-up-lithuania-force-as-scholz-begins-diplomatic-blitz
