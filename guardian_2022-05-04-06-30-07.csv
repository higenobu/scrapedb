5/4/2022,"Brittney Griner dropped her impassive game face, looked at me with big sad eyes and said, “The nightmare for me was definitely feeling like I was forgotten and that I was going to end up alone.” I no longer saw a superstar. My heart ached for a young person who was an ocean away from everyone she knew. “Got here and I was all alone… I was just like ah, hell no, my life is coming to an end,” she said. We cannot allow Brittney’s fear of being forgotten, alone and far from home come true. It was 2014 and we sat in an empty conference room in Hangzhou, China. I’d flown 20 hours from Los Angeles to direct an ESPN documentary about her inaugural season overseas. Fresh out of college, she was drowning in homesickness. She didn’t speak the language and no one on her team spoke English. She didn’t like the food and survived off KFC, Pizza Hut and Skittles. And she spent her waking hours either on the hardwood or in her gray penthouse suite at the Zijingang International Hotel. Imagine all of the melancholy of Lost in Translation and none of the Bill Murray. She was there for the money. As the No 1 pick in the 2013 WNBA draft, Brittney made $49,000 in her first season for the Phoenix Mercury against the $600,000 she earned with the Zhejiang Golden Bulls. If a women’s basketball player wants to make top dollar, she must go overseas. Half of the WNBA travels to countries like China, Russia, Turkey and France for much higher salaries, which raises the question whether their careers in the US count as their real off-season. As I rewatch her interview footage today, I’m haunted by the sense that Brittney is talking about her fears not then, but now, from inside a Russian prison cell where she’s been held since 17 February. Again, she’s overseas because that’s where the money is. UMMC Ekaterinburg, where she’s played since 2015 and won back-to-back championships, pays her more than $1m, compared to roughly $228,000 from the Phoenix Mercury. Moscow alleges that she was caught with hashish oil at Sheremetyevo Airport, a crime punishable by 10 years in prison. But why should we jump to the conclusion that this Black woman is a criminal and that Russian officials aren’t lying? After years of passing through customs in Russia, do we believe she’d pack hashish oil now? The accusation of “large-scale drug transportation” by Russian authorities would be laughable if the stakes weren’t so terrifyingly high. Remember, this is the government that claims the warship Moskva burst into “fire of unknown origin” a few weeks ago instead of admitting that in all likelihood Ukrainian missiles were responsible for its sinking. I trust Russian officials to tell the truth about Brittney as much as I trust a sieve to hold water. Until Tuesday’s announcement from the US Department of State reclassifying Brittney as “wrongfully detained,” the White House, the WNBA and Brittney’s family have been largely quiet. As former WNBA star Lisa Leslie said, “What we were told was to not make a big fuss about it, so they could not use her as a pawn so to speak in this situation in war.” When I first heard this directive, I didn’t question it. I didn’t post about Brittney on social media. So often as women we are told to behave, to trust experts who know better – to comply. I’m a documentary filmmaker. I don’t know anything about international hostage negotiations. The time for silence is now over. Weeks have given way to months. A Moscow court recently announced that her detention will be extended to 19 May – a date that could be moved further into the future faster than you can say “human rights violation”. According to Tom Firestone, a former legal advisor to the US embassy in Moscow, Brittney could be held without trial for up to 18 months. Tuesday’s policy change from the White House may help shorten her sentence but it could just as easily make things worse during a time of heightened political tension between the US and Russia. Brittney may turn out to be a political hostage in a violent, homophobic country run by a sociopath who once called teaching gender fluidity “a crime against humanity”. Brittney, a two-time Olympic gold medalist who has also won NCAA, WNBA and EuroLeague championships, is the rock star of women’s basketball. She dunks at will, flaunts her gender non-conformity in couture suits, and not unlike the other Britney, likes to wear albino snakes. She’s a Black, queer woman on her second marriage and a proud LGBTQ+ activist. Few hate the values that Brittney embodies more than Vladimir Putin. We must not wait for her trial to be changed again. Or – God forbid – only stomp, scream, and make all the fuss too late, after we learn she has vanished under “mysterious circumstances.” I believe that the Biden Administration and Brittney’s team have been working hard behind closed doors to bring her home. I also believe that the “please don’t make a fuss” embargo has provided cover for the misogyny and racism of many Americans. Look for the self-righteous “she’s getting what she deserves” attitude. Some American “patriots” hate Brittney for exercising her right to stay in the locker room for the national anthem to honor Breonna Taylor and other victims of police brutality. They don’t want to hear that she said, “I don’t mean that in any disrespect to our country. My dad was in Vietnam and a law officer for 30 years. I wanted to be a cop before basketball. I do have pride for my country.” Ask yourself what the hell that’s about. Roughly 100,000 Black women and girls went missing in 2020 in the United States – yet they rarely make national headlines. According to NPR, media outlets are four times more likely to report on a missing white person versus someone who is Black or brown. (Some call this “missing white woman syndrome.”) In Brittney’s case, when does cooperative silence become complicit neglect? The answer is right now. Today’s announcement from the state department leaves no doubt. Imagine that instead of a 6ft 9in, tattooed, dreadlocked, Black woman in a Russian prison, it was a pretty blonde with a husband back home. Or what if it had been LeBron James or Steph Curry? Or Tom Brady? People would have lost their damn minds. “Don’t make a fuss” wouldn’t have been an option because no matter what the State Department might decree, it would have been a headline in every news broadcast and mentioned on ESPN twice an hour. Candlelight fan vigils would have dotted America from sea to shining sea. Perhaps such “a fuss” would have been bad for hostage negotiations – but the lack of outcry says everything about why Brittney had to go to an authoritarian, homophobic country in order to get paid in the first place. At the end of my shoot in China with Brittney, I asked one last question: “Flight or invisibility, which power would you choose?” What a dumb question. Obviously a basketball player would choose flight. “Invisibility,” she said with conviction. I furrowed my brow. But it made sense as I followed her through the bowels of the Shanghai subway station – every neck craned to behold a young legend striding past. At an outdoor market too many people pointed and stared for me to count. She graciously posed for photos with fan after fan. It must be exhausting to be a spectacle everywhere you go. I didn’t use the invisibility moment in the film, but I find myself obsessing over it these days. As if out of Edgar Allan Poe’s The Tell-Tale Heart, it feels like her wish has been granted, but in the form of a curse. I wish she had chosen flight.",Sport/Sport,"The Brittney Griner I knew wanted to be invisible.

5/4/2022,"With little hope of reprieve ahead of the warming summer months, demand for water in parts of drought-stricken California is outpacing supply. The metropolitan water district of southern California declared a water shortage emergency last week for areas that rely on the State Water Project, a sprawling system of canals, reservoirs, and pipelines that snake across roughly two-thirds the length of the state, impacting about 6 million southern Californians in Los Angeles, San Bernardino, and Ventura counties. Describing the drought as “one of the most alarming challenges our region has ever faced” metropolitan issued unprecedented restrictions limiting outdoor watering to one day per week and also called on all southern Californians to cut their use by up to 30%. If conservation efforts fail to fall in line with declining supplies by September, the rules could be tightened with an all-out ban on outdoor watering. “The reality is, this drought has left us without the water supply we need to meet normal demands in these areas,” said Adel Hagekhalil, metropolitan general manager in a statement. “To make sure we have enough water for their basic human health and safety needs, everyone in these communities must immediately and dramatically reduce their water use.” The move is a marked shift in a drought disaster that’s only expected to deepen with warmer and drier days ahead. Now in the third year of the drought, supplies across the region are becoming increasingly strained. Experts say more restrictions across the state are likely as the effects of climate crisis unfold faster than expected. More than a third of the American west is categorized in “Extreme drought” by the US Drought monitor, and water systems that supply the region are already stressed heading into another hot summer. The climate crisis is amplifying the effects and spiking temperatures typically push water levels lower as they drive demand higher. Meanwhile, the state’s snowpack – now at just 35% of normal for this time of year – is quickly disappearing. The metropolitan water district of southern California caters to roughly 19 million people, delivering 1.5bn gallons of water a day to 26 smaller agencies through 830 miles of pipelines. Roughly a quarter of the water travels 242 miles across the desert from the imperiled Colorado River. Another 45% is sourced from local supplies – a diverse portfolio of water recycling, groundwater, desalination, and flows from the eastern Sierra operated by the city of Los Angeles. The remaining 30% is supplied by the State Water Project, owned and operated by the California department of water resources. Sourced from the northern Sierra, the system in total serves 27 million Californians and provides water for 750,000 acres of farmland at the heart of California’s agricultural sector, which grows nearly half of the nation’s produce. Bracing for another year of devastatingly dry conditions and record-low precipitation, state officials announced last month that they were cutting water allocations from 15% to 5%. Metropolitan, as one of the largest water distributors in the US, is the system’s biggest contractor – and the reduced supply was sharply felt. Usage typically increases over the summer when the days get hot and dry. But this year, southern Californians in districts supplied by the State Water Project will have dramatically less to work with. Metropolitan has restricted outdoor watering to one-day-a-week and is limiting users to 80 gallons of water a person a day – a 36% drop from the 125 gallons the average southern Californian typically uses. As a wholesaler, Metropolitan has left specifics and enforcement up to local distributors, but included steep penalties for those who don’t comply, levying a $2,000 fine for additional water used over reduced allocations. Californians have navigated droughts before and the adaptations implemented in previous years have helped prepare them for reducing use. But outdoor remains an issue. Lush green lawns can still be spotted across the rapidly aridifying landscapes, tucked in front of businesses or lining sidewalks. The aesthetic accents offer little, but consume a lot. That’s why Heather Cooley, the director of research at the Pacific Institute, a water-focused thinktank, says the restrictions are a step in the right direction. “We don’t know how long this is going to go on so every drop of water we save now is water that can be used later,” she says, noting that a specific action – like one-day-a-week watering windows – is more helpful for users than an abstract percentage reduction. “Our research finds the greatest opportunities for saving water are outside the home and businesses. That is critical.” About half of California’s urban use goes outside. In some parts of the state, according to Cooley, up to 80% of water goes to landscaping. “Cutting back watering is one of the fastest things we can do to dramatically cut water use” Cooley says, and the time to do it is now. “This is the time when people start ramping up the outdoor use and realizing those savings from the beginning of the summer are critically important.” Agriculture still claims the lion’s share of California’s water supply but the state is still trying to reduce residential and urban use. Restrictions so far have been applied locally. Last year, Governor Gavin Newsom called for a voluntary 15% reduction but consumption actually ticked up afterward rising 2.6% in January, which was the second-driest month on record. Newsom escalated calls for conservation in March, issuing an executive order requiring urban water suppliers to amp up conservation and drought plans that indicate a shortage of up to 20%. Experts have called for stronger limits, as the climate crisis rapidly unfolds in the state and normal cycles of drought become longer and much more frequent. “The water we have now is 40% lower than the worst-case scenario in the models ever predicted,” says Dr Kurt Schwabe, a professor of Environmental Economics and Policy at the University of California Riverside. Schwabe added that he thinks the state is being too cautious about pushing agencies to do more. “We are in a new climate reality and we have to adjust more quickly than we had in the past.” Droughts are a normal part of the climate in California but rising temperatures have increased their intensity. Less snow is falling and when it does, it melts much faster, reducing runoff from what’s essentially the state’s water savings account. The predicted runoff from April through July is forecast at just 41% of average, according to the California water board. Heat bakes moisture out of the environment, speeding evaporation and stresses plants, animals, and urban and agricultural systems that require more water to manage, as supplies wane. Along with getting Californians to curb their consumption, Schwabe says updates that make the system more efficient will be essential. Statewide water use in cities and suburbs can be reduced by more than 30% with more efficient systems according to a study from the Pacific Institute. The study found opportunities to more than triple municipal water reuse and significant potential for stormwater recapture. Metropolitan is already looking into bolstering its supply, exploring improvements to infrastructure and investing in new sources, including recycled water. Desalination, a more controversial and energy intensive approach with the potential for negative environmental impacts, has also been considered. “You would have to build a desalination plant every four miles along the coast to replace the water we import,” according to a Metropolitan informational page about the issue on its website. “That isn’t an environmentally or economically feasible solution. We must maintain the reliability of our imported supplies.” But for now, conservation will be key. “Californians have done a wonderful job in terms of reducing their gallons per capita per day,” Schwabe says, adding that it’s largely done indoors. There are still opportunities to reduce outdoor use and options left to navigate drought conditions, even as they become more intense. “There is reason to be optimistic,” he says, cautioning agencies against relying too heavily on raised rates as disincentives that make water less accessible to lower-income households. “There are these shifts with the timing of water, how often you water, and then there is the landscape you have to water. That’s the area where there are still significant opportunities.”",News/US news,California’s new drought rules: will they be enough to halt the ‘alarming challenges’ ahead?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/03/californias-new-drought-rules-will-they-be-enough-to-halt-the-alarming-challenges-ahead

The US supreme court is poised to overturn Roe v Wade, the most fundamental rulings in US law that enshrined the right to abortion nationwide, according to a leaked draft opinion. Chief Justice John Roberts confirmed the authenticity of the document and announced an investigation into the leak. Publication of the draft opinion sparked demonstrations outside America’s highest court, condemnation from Joe Biden and fears the judiciary has suffered profound damage to its reputation for independence. Biden has said he is “not prepared” to support ending a Senate filibuster to pass abortion rights law. More than half of US states will outlaw abortion immediately or as soon as practicable, if the law is overturned.

Alex Garland’s next film, Men, is due for release in June. If you’re intrigued by the mysterious trailer, then Garland’s directorial debut, Ex Machina, is well worth investigating. “With this tense, psychological thriller, Garland asks the biggest question of all: what does it mean to be alive?

5/4/2022,"Mwai Kibaki, who has died aged 90, stood at the crossroads of fundamental political change in Kenya, often without knowing the scale of the forces he was helping to unleash. He served as the country’s third president, from 2002 to 2013; his most meaningful reform was the introduction of free primary education. But corruption dogged his administration and constitutional issues, particularly in terms of how much power should be vested in the presidency, often dominated. In 2007 Kibaki won elections that no major external observer group felt able to validate as free and fair, and as a result huge violence broke out across Kenya, much of it in the shape of ethnic conflict. It took the intervention of the former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan to force a compromise in which Kibaki retained the presidency while his political rival, Raila Odinga, became prime minister. A subsequent rewriting of the Kenyan constitution reduced the powers of the presidency considerably, and a chastened Kibaki turned his technocratic skills to reforming and reviving the national economy. He achieved economic growth against considerable odds and was able to revitalise parts of the country that had previously been overlooked by governments seeking only electoral support. Although corruption remained untamed and the spectre of ethnic favouritism was never fully diminished, by the time he left office Kibaki could claim to have transformed and modernised the Kenyan economy along more inclusive lines, and – even if it was forced on him – to have presided over an equally important overhaul of the country’s constitution. Kibaki was born in the village of Gatuyaini to Kibaki Gĩthĩnji and Teresia Wanjikũ, who were peasant farmers. Showing early academic promise, he went to Mang’u high school before moving on to Makerere University in Uganda, gaining first class honours in economics and then going on to the London School of Economics, where his postgraduate studies focused on public finance. Returning to Africa, Kibaki taught at Makerere until 1961, when he joined the Kenya African National Union party (Kanu) as an executive officer and began his career in politics as Kenya became independent in 1963. Kanu dominated in the early days of the country’s single-party state, and Kibaki quickly rose through its ranks. By 1969 he was minister of finance under the first president, Jomo Kenyatta, and under Kenya’s successor, Daniel arap Moi, he also held ministerial portfolios, becoming vice-president from 1978 to 1988. However, after Kenya reverted to a multiparty system in 1991 – following much pressure from the populace – Kibaki soon abandoned Kanu and declared himself founder of the Democratic party, one of a host of new opposition parties. In 1992 and 1997 he lost to Moi in the presidential elections, mainly due to division within opposition ranks, but he carried on as leader of the official opposition from 1998 to 2002, when finally – in an alliance of parties – he succeeded in winning the presidency. Unlike his predecessors Kibaki never sought to embed himself in a personality cult, and his image was of a quiet, gentlemanly technocrat. However, during his first term it was generally felt that corruption increased, and his undemonstrative demeanour meant he was unable to achieve great personal popularity with the electorate, despite his early introduction of free primary education across the country. When Kibaki lost a referendum that would have introduced more sweeping presidential powers, it became clear that the electorate was already tiring of an administration in which Kibaki’s supporters and Kikuyu kinsmen felt it was their “turn to eat”, as the popular phrase went. At the same time, support grew for a more diversified constitutional system that could usher in greater equity in development and economic progress. All of this meant that Kibaki faced an uphill battle during the 2007 presidential elections. Heading a new coalition of parties, he faced a formidable opposition led by Odinga and all the opinion polls, including one commissioned by the US government, had his rival ahead. Early counting also had Odinga winning the election, but somehow Kibaki turned the tables and cries of fraudulent intervention in the count began to gather volume, with external observers doubting the result’s credibility. Before the election had been held, Kibaki and Odinga had mobilised nationwide gangs of party supporters, ready to swing violently into action in the event the result went against them. After the election Kenya was plunged into political conflict, with more than 1,000 deaths and hundreds of thousands displaced from their homes. It took the intervention of Annan, at the behest of the African Union, to force the non-constitutional compromise in which Kibaki kept the presidency but Odinga was made prime minister. Against Annan’s background threat of indictments before the international criminal court, a resultant rewriting of the Kenyan constitution involving a team of jurists drawn from several African jurisdictions reduced the powers of the presidency greatly. Working under a new constitutional framework and without the possibility of running for the presidency again, Kibaki turned his attentions to the economy, and despite being hampered by the global financial crisis of 2008 was able to make progress. Some of the work had begun in his first term, but he was able to make a much greater and wider-reaching difference in his second stint with the help of his coalition partners. His successor, Uhuru Kenyatta, praised Kibaki as a transformer. Kibaki married Lucy Muthoni in 1961; she died in 2016. He is survived by their four children, Judy, Jimmy, David and Tony. In 2005 the Kenyan media reported that Kibaki had a second wife, Mary Wambui. She was a political activist in his party whom he had allegedly married under customary law in the 1970s. Wambui frequently appeared as if she were the first lady, but Kibaki always denied that she was his spouse.

5/4/2022,"Men and boys are among the alleged victims of rape by Russian soldiers in Ukraine, where dozens of cases of sexual violence by the invading forces are already under investigation, UN and Ukrainian officials said on Tuesday. “I have received reports, not yet verified … about sexual violence cases against men and boys in Ukraine,” said Pramila Patten, UN special representative on sexual violence in war, at a press conference in Kyiv. Patten added that it can be particularly challenging for male rape survivors to report the crime. “It’s hard for women and girls to report [rape] because of stigma amongst other reasons, but it’s often even harder for men and boys to report … we have to create that safe space for all victims to report cases of sexual violence.” She warned that dozens of cases of sexual violence that are under investigation so far “only represent the tip of the iceberg”, as she urged survivors to come forward, and the international community to find perpetrators and hold them responsible. “Today’s documentation will be tomorrow’s prosecution,” she said. Ukraine’s prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova said on Tuesday that her office had collected reports of sexual violence by Russian troops against men and women of all ages, from children to elderly people. Speaking at a news conference in the shattered Kyiv suburb of Irpin, one of a cluster of small towns whose names have become synonymous with Russian war crimes, Venediktova said Moscow had used rape as a deliberate strategy. “This is, of course, to scare civil society … to do everything to [force Ukraine to] capitulate.” There have been few public accounts of sexual violence in Ukraine. Some victims have left the country, and others who have stayed are frightened of speaking about their experience, Venediktova said. However, teams of prosecutors and investigators have been gathering evidence of widespread sexual violence since Russian forces retreated just over a month ago. Gang-rapes, assaults at gunpoint, and rapes committed in front of children are among the grim testimonies they have collected from victims and their families. The country’s human rights commissioner Lyudmila Denisova, has officially documented the cases of 25 women who were kept in a basement and systematically raped in Bucha, which neighbours Irpin. Forensic doctors carrying out postmortem examinations on women buried in mass graves say they have also found evidence some were raped before being killed by Russian forces. UN envoy Patten said she was visiting Kyiv because of the overwhelming indications of widespread, systematic sexual violence in the conflict, and the risk to Ukrainian women from trafficking if they try to flee the conflict. “All the warning signals are flashing red in Ukraine, with allegations of brutal sexual violence emerging,” she said, at a press conference with Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Olga Stefanishina. “I could not stay back in my office in New York, in the face of such harrowing reports of sexual violence. I’m here because we must spare no effort to ensure zero tolerance and consistent consequences for these crimes,” Patten said. While the fighting has ended around Kyiv for now, Russian soldiers still hold swathes of territory in the south and east of the country. Amid growing concern about rape there too, activists are trying to get emergency contraception into Ukrainian hospitals as quickly as possible. Patten warned that for too long, the world had allowed sexual violence to be deployed as a cheap, silent and effective weapon against whole communities. “Cheap, because it is cost free. Very effective, because it does not only affect the victim, it affects whole families, the communities,” she said. “It is biological warfare. It is psychological warfare.” She said the UN would work with Ukrainian authorities to provide support for survivors, but is also investigating crimes to prepare cases for criminal trial. Ukrainian investigators have already identified Russian soldiers they allege are responsible for war crimes including sexual violence, and an arrest warrant has been issued for one man accused of rape. There has been international support for investigations, with French and Dutch forensic experts already on the ground. Britain has also promised to send investigators to help gather evidence of war crimes, including sexual violence. But many question whether soldiers who have already retreated will face prosecution, as they are under the protection of the government in Moscow which ordered the invasion and denies committing war crimes.",News/World news,Men and boys among alleged rape victims of Russian soldiers in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/men-and-boys-among-alleged-victims-by-russian-soldiers-in-ukraine
