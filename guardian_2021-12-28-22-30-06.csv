12/28/2021,"Shell will be forced to halt oil exploration in vital whale breeding grounds along South Africa’s eastern coastline after a local court blocked the controversial project. The court order calls for an immediate halt to Shell’s seismic tests which involve blasting sound waves through the relatively untouched Wild Coast marine environment, which is home to whales, dolphins and seals.  The community campaigners behind the legal challenge welcomed the court’s decision as a victory for “voiceless” indigenous groups living near the coast which hold customary rights to undertake small-scale fishing in the area, as well as a cultural and spiritual connection to the ocean. Lawyers for the groups successfully argued that Shell had failed to meaningfully consult people who would be affected by the seismic survey and also provided evidence of the threat of harm to marine life. Wilmien Wicomb, an attorney at the Legal Resources Centre, said the case held “huge significance” because it showed that “no matter how big a company is, it ignores local communities at its peril”. “This case is really a culmination of the struggle of communities along the Wild Coast for the recognition of their customary rights to land and fishing, and to respect for their customary processes,” Wicomb said. Sinegugu Zukulu, a senior campaigner for Sustaining the Wild Coast, added: “The voices of the voiceless have been heard. The voices of the directly affected people have at last been heard, and the constitutional rights of indigenous people have been upheld.” The victory for local communities follows an unsuccessful 11th-hour legal challenge by environmental groups earlier this month to block Shell’s plans on the grounds that it could cause irreparable damage to the environment. Critics of Shell’s presence on the Wild Coast argue its plans were approved using outdated legislation. Shell received the green light in 2014 from South Africa’s then minister of mineral resources, Ngoako Ramatlhodi, just months before new environmental legislation was put in place. The oil company could be forced to comply with the tougher environmental regulation to move forward with its exploration plan for the sensitive ecological region, subject to a separate court hearing. “This case reminds us that constitutional rights belong to the people and not to government,” Zukulu said. “And that the only way that we can [ensure] that the rights of indigenous people are living – and not just written on paper – is if we challenge government decisions that disregard these rights. This victory is hugely significant because we have made sure that the rights of indigenous communities are kept alive.” A Shell spokesperson said: “We respect the court’s decision and have paused the survey while we review the judgment.”",News/Business,Campaigners force Shell to halt oil exploration on South African coast,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/28/campaigners-force-shell-to-halt-oil-exploration-on-south-african-coast
12/28/2021,"Jury deliberations in the sex-trafficking trial of Ghislaine Maxwell will resume on Tuesday in federal court in Manhattan.  The trial commenced in earnest on 29 November. Maxwell, who turned 60 on Christmas Day, faces six counts relating to alleged involvement in her ex-boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of girls, some as young as 14. Maxwell pleaded not guilty. Epstein, a financier and convicted sex offender with high-profile associates including Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, was arrested in July 2019 for sex trafficking minor teens. He killed himself in a New York City federal jail about a month after his arrest, while awaiting trial. Jurors started deliberating late on 20 December. They did not attend court on 23 or 24 December, due to the Christmas holiday. They have asked to see testimony from Maxwell’s accusers and several witnesses who appeared to corroborate their accounts. On Monday, jurors requested to see a transcript of testimony from Matt, the ex-boyfriend of Jane, the first Maxwell accuser to testify. Shortly after requesting Matt’s testimony, jurors asked to see a transcript of testimony by a former Palm Beach police officer, Gregory Parkinson. In October 2005, Parkinson led a search of Epstein’s property in the Florida resort. In testimony, he talked jurors through a video of the search and responded to questions about still images that appeared on screen. After Parkinson noted the presence of a “portable, collapsible massage table”, a detective brought a massage table into the courtroom. Parkinson got down from the witness stand and, with gloved hands, examined the table. Prosecutors asked him to describe what he saw. “The table itself in an open position,” Parkinson said. Jurors also requested to see the transcript of testimony from David Rodgers, one of Epstein’s pilots. Before Nathan dismissed jurors, around 5pm, she told them that if they didn’t reach a verdict on Tuesday, they should be prepared to stay later going forward. “I don’t mean to pressure you in any way,” the judge said. “You should take all the time that you need.” Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

12/28/2021,"Welcome to Pushing Buttons, the Guardian’s brand new gaming newsletter. If you’d like to receive it in your inbox every week, just pop your email in below – and check your inbox (and spam) for the confirmation email.  Welcome back to Pushing Buttons! I’m Keza MacDonald, the Guardian’s video games editor. I have been a video games journalist for 16 years, and my extended family only recently stopped asking me when I was going to get a real job over Christmas dinner. I guess they’ve given up on me now. This December, as usual, the release calendar has been as sparse as the hairs on Agent 47’s head. Last year we at least had Cyberpunk 2077’s fiasco of a launch to distract us from the end-of-2020 doldrums; you can only hope that it will fare better when the PS5 and Xbox Series X versions are, finally, released in the spring. On the plus side, right now there is actually time to catch up on things without the distraction of shiny new things coming out every week. Absorbing myself in a video game has always been a good way to stave off end-of-year ennui in the festive perineum between Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Those Christmas games loom large in the memory – one year it was Mass Effect 2, which I played for days straight wrapped in a duvet in my freezing cold Edinburgh flat; one Christmas as a teenager I persuaded my parents to get me Animal Crossing on US import and spent the subsequent days completely ignoring my family in favour of my new weird animal neighbours. (I’ve got my own kids now, and last year I did the same in Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Some things don’t change.) It’s been a strange year for games, partly because the knock-on effects of Covid-19 have delayed the process of game development so much that most of the things we thought we’d be playing now have drifted into next year. Game development is an extraordinarily collaborative endeavour, especially when there are 100 or more people on a team, and working from home has slowed things down massively at a lot of studios with whom I’ve spoken. Playground Games spent last year finishing off the excellent racing game Forza Horizon 5, and designer Anna Poliakova explains that testing multiplayer was much, much easier when you’ve got everyone playing together in the studio: “You can tell if one player is seeing something completely different from the other three. At home, you’re having to describe it to each other, like: ‘What can you see? Hold on, what colour is my car on your screen?!’” Even stuff like figuring out how to get the latest build of the game playable on every individual developer’s computer became a logistical nightmare. Applause, then, for the teams behind the great games that actually did come out this year: Forza, Hitman 3, Deathloop, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, the long-delayed and brilliantly surreal Psychonauts 2, which vies with intimidating time-loop space shooter Returnal for my personal game of the year. Our games correspondent Keith Stuart and I recently picked our top 15 games of 2021 – give it a read, and decide what’s going to soak up your time as the year limps to an end. The ongoing pandemic has changed my relationship with video games, and I know I’m not the only one. If 2020 was the year that games saved us all, giving us a safe and fun way to socialise and entertain ourselves when everything was terrible and nobody was allowed to outside for more than 20 minutes a day, 2021 was the year that we tentatively started living again. I found myself less drawn to virtual worlds; I abandoned my Animal Crossing island, only returning shame-faced to bear the resentful barbs from my neighbours when Nintendo released a raft of interesting new stuff for the game in November (who would say no to a pigeon called Brewster who serves coffee?). Psychologically, though, being back in Animal Crossing felt like returning to the depths of last year’s mentally brutalising lockdowns. Back then it was my escape, but now it feels like an unwelcome reminder. I wonder how many people will have a similar reaction when they think back on Among Us, or Fall Guys, or Fortnite, or any of the other games that got them through the pandemic, in years to come. I’m going to cast my mind right back to the beginning of the year to recommend Olija, a game that missed out on our games of the year list but that nonetheless sticks in my memory. It’s a short, nostalgic, rather eerie action-adventure game about an aristocrat who sails to a forsaken place to try to find a better future for his people, and it has the freshest, most beautifully animated pixel art I’ve seen in years. You can tell when a game is a passion project – Olija was mostly made by one person, Japan-resident developer Thomas Olsson, and although it’s over quickly, it’s so atmospheric, enigmatic and snappy to play that it’s well worth the time it takes.

I especially enjoyed Polygon’s, partly because it looks gorgeous, and partly because many of the 50 games on this list are ones that I didn’t already know about. Xbox’s Game Pass has continued to prove itself in 2021, putting Microsoft ahead of everyone else in the rush to become the (sigh) “Netflix of gaming”. (Google Stadia, looks increasingly beleaguered; Google shut down its only development studio early this year after a troublingly short period, and confidence in the service does not appear to be high.) Kotaku makes a case for 2021 marking the beginning of the death of the Xbox – and why that wouldn’t necessarily be such a bad thing. Another defining story of the year in games has been the flood of revelations about toxic working culture and harassment at Activision Blizzard, the company behind Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and much else, which is now facing several lawsuits. The allegations run right up to famously uber-wealthy longtime CEO Bobby Kotick, and have sparked walkouts and a unionisation push among its 10,000ish employees. If you’ve had trouble keeping up with all the ongoing and very revealing reporting on one of the games industry’s giants, this rundown from CNET will catch you up. This week I asked our games correspondent Keith Stuart the question that has been preoccupying warring forum-dwellers since the 90s: what’s best, consoles or PC? No one who considers themselves a serious video game scholar would attempt to answer this question – which is why I’m doing it. In terms of sheer technical oomph, a cutting edge PC is unbeatable as a gaming platform. You’ll need to spend between £1000 and £2000, but that will get you the Imax of gaming, with astonishing visuals and ultra smooth animation. Within two years, however, your system will start to creak, and you’ll think about upgrading – and then you’re chained to the treadmill. In terms of value and ease-of-use, consoles rule: you get an expertly designed system that will last between five and eight years, and every game you buy will work perfectly on it. For most people, the visuals will be fine – in fact, for a few years, they’ll be spectacular – and landmark games that won’t be available anywhere else for years. Which is better? For experts, the PC, for the rest of us, consoles. Don’t @ me. I’d welcome your questions for Question Block in the new year – hit reply on this newsletter to submit them, and I’ll find someone interesting to answer them!",Arts/Games,Was 2021 the worst year ever for games?,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/dec/28/pushing-buttons-video-games-christmas
12/28/2021,"China has accused the US of ignoring international treaty obligations and engaging in irresponsible and unsafe conduct in outer space after two near misses between the Chinese space station and satellites operated by Elon Musk’s SpaceX company. Zhao Lijian, a foreign ministry spokesperson, said on Tuesday that China “urges the US to act responsibly” after incidents involving SpaceX’s Starlink satellites, which he said had posed a serious threat to the lives and safety of astronauts.  In a note to the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space earlier this month, China said Tiangong, its new space station, had to manoeuvre to avoid one Starlink satellite in July and another in October. Tiangong had to take “preventive collision avoidance control” during the two “close encounters” after the Starlink satellites had moved into orbits that obliged Tiangong’s operators to change its course, the document said. “The manoeuvre strategy was unknown and orbital errors were hard to assess,” Beijing said of the satellite involved in the October incident, adding that it took action to “ensure the safety and lives of in-orbit astronauts”. The note said the incidents “constituted dangers to the life or health of astronauts onboard the China space station” and asked the UN secretary general “to circulate the above mentioned information to all states parties to the outer space treaty”. Starlink, a division of Musk’s private company SpaceX, has launched more than 1,600 satellites. It has permission from US authorities to launch a total of up to 12,000 in a programme aiming to provide internet access to most of the planet. China’s note to the UN space agency in Vienna said state parties to the outer space treaty, which is the foundation of international space law, “bear international responsibility” for activities carried out by both government and non-governmental bodies in space. Evasive manoeuvres to reduce the risk of collisions in space were becoming more frequent owing to the number and speed at which satellites were being launched, said Jonathan McDowell, of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. “Starlink is a big part of that,” McDowell said, adding that it was “highly unusual” for a country to lodge a complaint through an “informational bulletin”. Any collision would be likely to “completely demolish” the Chinese space station, he said. McDowell added that China was also a big contributor to space junk. “The US space station has several times over the past 10 years had to dodge pieces from the Chinese military anti-satellite test of 2007,” he said. “It’s not like the Chinese had a clean record here. The biggest debris event ever was the Chinese anti-satellite test.” He said the incidents were a reminder the world had entered a new era in space. “There’s more debris and there’s more active satellites. Things are just getting a lot busier and a lot more crowded up there. It’s a commercially dominated space age … where we’re stressing the space environment for the first time.” The core module of China’s station Tiangong – whose name means “heavenly palace” – entered orbit this year and is expected to become fully operational in 2022. Beijing’s complaint prompted heavy criticism on Chinese social media of Musk, whose electric car firm Tesla sells tens of thousands of vehicles in China each month. Musk is widely admired in China, although Tesla’s reputation has been tarnished after a rash of recent crashes and scandals. One hashtag on the Weibo social networking platform recorded 90m views on Tuesday. “How ironic that Chinese people buy Tesla, contributing large sums of money so Musk can launch Starlink, and then he (nearly) crashes into China’s space station,” one user said. “Prepare to boycott Tesla,” said another Weibo user, echoing a common response in China to foreign brands perceived to be acting contrary to national interests. Some speculated that Washington would have imposed sanctions if the roles were reversed. “Why don’t we just do what they do?” one wrote. California-based SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",News/World news,China berates US after ‘close encounters’ with Elon Musk satellites,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/dec/28/china-complains-to-un-after-space-station-is-forced-to-move-to-avoid-starlink-satellites
