1/6/2022,"ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) — And it wasn't a Saint Bernard. Croatian rescuers are praising a dog who protected his injured owner from freezing high on a snowy mountain, keeping him warm for 13 hours in the dark until he could get medical attention. “Friendship and love between man and dog know no boundaries,” the county's mountain rescue service wrote on Twitter Tuesday, with a photo of the dog lying on top of his master on a stretcher. The accident occurred late on Jan. 1 more than 1,700 meters (5,600 feet) up Mount Velebit, that stretches along Croatia’s Adriatic Sea coast. Rescuers say both man and dog — an Alaskan Malamute called North — slipped and fell about 150 meters (500 feet). The hiker seriously hurt his leg but the dog was uninjured, and used its body heat to keep him warm as temperatures dropped after nightfall and rescuers strove to locate them. “(North) curled beside him and warmed him with his body,"" the rescue service's post said. ""His loyalty didn’t stop even when the rescuers came, he was one of us, guarding his man for 13 hours.” Rescuers said the overnight operation was particularly difficult because of snow, ice and broken tree boughs that blocked access to the spot. A team of 27 took part in the rescue, reaching the pair around midnight and handing over the hiker to medics about 8 a.m. on Tuesday. “This example could teach us all how to care about each other,” the rescuers said.",U.S./Associated Press,Croatian rescuers praise dog's care for hurt mountain hiker,https://news.yahoo.com/croatian-rescuers-praise-dogs-care-141222809.html
1/6/2022,"Richard Marcinko, founder and first commanding officer of SEAL Team Six, died on Christmas Day. Marcinko had a long and unique career, earning attention for his leadership and unconventional style. Despite the blemishes on his record, Marcinko is remembered by many as a special-operations visionary. As a turbulent year ended, the Navy SEAL community lost one of its most influential and controversial members. Retired Cmdr. Richard ""Dick"" Marcinko, the founder and first commanding officer of the elite SEAL Team Six, died at 81 on Christmas Day. The famous Navy SEAL's military career got off to a rough start. When a young Marcinko went to his local Marine Corps recruiting office to enlist, he was shown the door for not having a high-school diploma. —Matt Marcinko (@yungspecter) December 26, 2021 But the Navy accepted an eager Marcinko as a radioman. Hungry for adventure and hardship, Marcinko volunteered for Naval Special Warfare and graduated from the grueling Underwater Demolition training, getting assigned to Underwater Demolition Team 21. Seeing his natural leadership and promise, his superiors recommended Marcinko for the Navy's Officer Candidate School, and soon he became an officer. He later deployed to Vietnam with SEAL Team Two. ""Demo Dick,"" as he became known, was highly decorated, earning the Silver Star, the third-highest award for valor under fire, and four Bronze Stars, as well as the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry during his two combat tours in Vietnam. The North Vietnamese so feared him that they put a bounty on his head. After the Vietnam War, Marcinko was the commanding officer of SEAL Team Two from 1974 to 1976. In that role, he started developing a counterterrorism capability for Naval Special Warfare. At the start, it was only a cell, known as ""Mobility 6,"" within SEAL Team Two. But when the Iranian hostage crisis highlighted the need for a dedicated counterterrorism force, the Navy tasked Marcinko with developing an equivalent to the Army's Delta Force. There were only two SEAL teams at the time, but Marcinko, a natural bluffer, chose to call the new unit SEAL Team Six to fool Soviet intelligence services into thinking there were several teams. When creating SEAL Team Six — later renamed Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU) — Marcinko handpicked his operators from the cream of the crop of Naval Special Warfare, choosing SEALs with combat experience. The unit's plank owners included Navy SEAL legends such as Medal of Honor recipient Mike Thornton. During the unit's early days, Marcinko fired one of his junior officers. That's not an uncommon occurrence, but it wasn't the last the SEALs saw of that junior officer, who was named William McRaven. McRaven bounced back from what could have been a career-ending development and went on to lead US Special Operations Command and its subcommand, Joint Special Operations Command, both of which oversee SEAL Team Six. McRaven also commanded Operation Neptune Spear, the SEAL Team Six mission that killed Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in 2011. Marcinko was successful in establishing the Navy's counterterrorism unit, but his controversial ways soon clashed with Navy and SOCOM leadership. SEAL Team Six operators were effective but looked more like pirates than professional troops. ""Marcinko was really the first famous SEAL. He worked hard and partied hard. He carried his unconventional ways in anything he did, and he was largely successful if you look at it in hindsight,"" a Navy SEAL operator, who was not authorized to speak to the press, told Insider. ""Some might say that he 'poisoned' the unit he created, but that was Dick. Whatever his vices, Dick Marcinko left his mark on SEAL history and shaped it like few others,"" the SEAL said. In 1983, Marcinko relinquished command of his unit and moved onto the ""Red Cell,"" a small unit designed to test and find vulnerabilities in some of the Pentagon's most classified facilities. Marcinko was ""a team guy through and through"" but earned a mixed reputation, a former Navy SEAL officer said. ""On the one hand, he created Development Group [SEAL Team Six], but on the other hand he encouraged the wrong culture. We recently saw the ugly aspects of that culture all over the news."" Controversy followed Marcinko out of the service. In 1989, he was accused of receiving $100,000 from an arms dealer in order to secure a contract with the Navy for hand grenades. The former frogman denied the charges but ended up serving 15 months of a 21-month sentence in federal prison. Despite the blemishes on his record, Marcinko left a mark on the US special-operations community and is remembered by many as a visionary who knew how to play the system and deal with red tape. ""Whatever your opinion of him, the man was a leader, no question about it. He had that leadership aura that moves people to do things, to act. That's natural leadership you can't teach,"" a former Navy SEAL officer told Insider. ""Those few fortunate to have it immediately stand out.""

1/6/2022,"Elon Musk tweeted that GM has ""room to improve"" after it sold 26 electric vehicles in Q4 of 2021. GM's Q4 2021 delivery table showed that it sold 25 Bolt EVs and EUVs, and one Hummer EV pickup. The results came after GM halted production of Bolt EVs and EUVs in August due to a battery defect. Elon Musk said on Twitter on Tuesday that General Motors (GM) has room to improve after the carmaker sold 26 electric vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2021. GM's table of the number of its US deliveries showed that 25 Bolt EVs and EUVs were sold in the final quarter of last year, along with one Hummer EV pickup. In comparison, GM sold 6,701 Bolt EVs and EUVs in the fourth quarter of 2020 but no Hummer EV pickups in the same period, according to the table. The Hummer EV pickup sold in the last quarter of 2021 was the only one to be sold in the entire calendar year, the table showed. GM said in August that it had halted Bolt EV and EUV production because of a defect in the vehicles' batteries, The Verge reported. GM didn't immediately respond to Insider's request for comment made outside of US operating hours. The news comes as Toyota overtook GM to become the bestselling automaker in the US in 2021. GM said on Tuesday it sold a total of 2.2 million vehicles last year in the US, down from 2.55 million in 2020.

1/6/2022,"Seven big US companies have pledged not to donate to Republican election objectors in 2022. The companies making the pledge to Popular Information include Microsoft, American Express, and Airbnb. The so-called Sedition Caucus comprises 147 GOP lawmakers who voted against certifying Biden's election victory. Seven top US companies including Microsoft, American Express, and Airbnb have pledged not to donate to any Republican election objectors in 2022. Popular Information contacted 183 companies asking if they would withhold donations to the 147 GOP lawmakers who voted against certifying Joe Biden's 2020 election win – a group that has been referred to as the ""Sedition Caucus."" Microsoft told Popular Information: ""We are committed to our pledge."" American Express previously told the publication that its PAC would never donate to any of the 147 election objectors again. The four other companies to make the no-donations pledge are Dow, BASF, Eversource Energy, and Lyft. Companies including NRG Energy and Marriott International didn't make the pledge directly but told Popular Information they'd keep their donation suspensions in place for the time being. Popular Information reported that General Electric previously said it wouldn't donate to Sedition Caucus members in 2022, but that it had supported them indirectly by funding the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) and the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC). After a mob of pro-Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, to try to prevent Congress certifying Biden's election win, many top US companies scrambled to cut ties with the 147 GOP lawmakers who voted against the result. Dozens of companies said they would stop giving donations to these lawmakers. Other companies said they would pause all political donations, review their contribution policies, or take the January 6 events into account when awarding funding. Not all companies have stuck to their promises. Major companies have donated around $8.1 million to Sedition Caucus members since January 2021, according to nonpartisan watchdog Accountable.US – and some of these had previously pledged to stop donations to members of the group.

1/6/2022,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday that Kazakhstan could solve its own problems and it was important that no one interfered from the outside, RIA news agency reported. It quoted Peskov as saying Kazakhstan had not requested Russian help to deal with protests, triggered by a fuel price increase, that prompted the resignation of its government on Wednesday. Russia is acutely sensitive to unrest in former Soviet republics it regards as part of its sphere of influence, and in the past has accused the West of stoking revolutions in countries such as Georgia and Ukraine. Russia's foreign ministry said it was closely monitoring the situation in its southern neighbour and counting on the ""soonest possible normalisation"". ""We advocate the peaceful resolution of all problems within the constitutional and legal framework and dialogue, rather than through street riots and the violation of laws,"" it said. It said this was precisely the aim of the steps taken by Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev ""to stabilize the situation and resolve existing problems quickly, including those contained in the legitimate demands of the protesters."" This appeared to refer to Tokayev's decision to reverse the New Year fuel price increase that first triggered protests in the west of the country. The Russian statement used more cautious language than Tokayev, who has blamed the violence on domestic and foreign provocateurs.
