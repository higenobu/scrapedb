1/13/2022,"About 1 in 10 adults was estimated to have a non-cancerous tumor than can affect diabetes and hypertension risk, based on a recent study. The study included British adults with tumors located on their adrenal glands. The glands are responsible for hormone production, so even a benign tumor can have a cascading impact. About one in every 10 adults was estimated to have a tumor in their adrenal glands, an area that modulates certain health risk factors, in a British study recently published in Annals of Internal Medicine. The tumors studied were benign, meaning they're non-cancerous and mostly harmless. However, their presence in the adrenal glands may cause elevated levels of a stress hormone, which can further increase a person's risk for Type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. Located on top of the kidneys, the adrenal glands make several hormones that help regulate metabolism, the immune system, and your response to stress, among other essential functions. A small lump in the glands — called an adrenal incidentaloma — can trigger excess hormone production, causing ripple effects throughout the body. As many as one in five patients with the tumor may have higher-than-normal levels of the stress hormone cortisol, according to a 2019 study published in the journal Endocrine. Cortisol drives many of the long-term health effects of stress, like high blood pressure, blood sugar, and overall inflammation. The more recent study aimed to better understand how those elevated cortisol levels might impact health down the line. Compared to patients who had the adrenal tumor without any hormone irregularities, those with elevated cortisol levels were more likely to be diagnosed with high blood pressure, study co-author Dr. Alessandro Prete said in a press release. After diagnosis, those patients also required more medication — usually three or more tablets — to manage their blood pressure compared to those with ""silent"" tumors. Patients with Type 2 diabetes on top of the cortisol issue were twice as likely to require insulin, a medication used to help people with diabetes control their blood sugar. The study included 1,305 British adults with adrenal incidentalomas and no evidence of Cushing syndrome, another disorder where the body makes too much cortisol. Cortisol irregularities linked to the tumor were more common in women than men, and most were at least 50 years old. About 10% of the adult British population are estimated to have adrenal incidentalomas, according to the study. Past estimates have put the rate at 3–5% in the general population and up to 10% in elderly.

1/13/2022,"At the White House briefing on Wednesday, press secretary Jen Psaki said Republicans’ claim that President Biden’s speech on voting rights Tuesday was offensive “is hilarious on many levels, given how many people sat silently over the last four years for the former president.” - Senator Romney today basically said-- I'll use the exact quote-- that the speech yesterday that the president gave was, quote, ""going down the same tragic road taken by President Trump in casting doubt on the reliability of American elections."" Does the White House have a response to that? JEN PSAKI: With all due respect to Senator Romney, I think anyone would note there's a night-and-day difference between fomenting an insurrection based on lies totally debunked by 80 judges, including Trump-appointed ones, and election authorities across the country and making objective, true statements, which is what the president made yesterday about the effects of a coordinated nationwide effort to undermine the constitutional right to vote. I know there has been a lot of claim of the offensive nature of the speech yesterday, which is hilarious on many levels, given how many people sat silently over the last four years for the former president, but I would note that in our view and the president's view, what is far more offensive is the effort to suppress people's basic right to exercise who they want to support and who they want to elect. That's not a partisan thing. And that was why he gave such a strong speech yesterday.

1/13/2022,"By Devjyot Ghoshal and Anand Katakam NEW DELHI(Reuters) -China has accelerated settlement-building along its disputed border with Bhutan, with more than 200 structures, including two-storey buildings, under construction in six locations, according to satellite image analysis conducted for Reuters. The images and analysis supplied to Reuters by U.S. data analytics firm HawkEye 360, which uses satellites to gather intelligence on ground-level activities, and vetted by two other experts, provide a detailed look into China's recent construction along its frontier with Bhutan. Construction-related activity in some of the locations along Bhutan's western border has been under way since early 2020, with China initially building tracks and clearing out areas, based on material provided by satellite imagery firms Capella Space and Planet Labs, said Chris Biggers, the mission applications director at HawkEye 360. Images show the work speeded up in 2021. Smaller structures were erected - possibly to house equipment and supplies - followed by the laying of foundations and then the construction of buildings, Biggers said. ""To me, 2021 was the period for acceleration,"" Biggers said. Two other experts who studied the locations of the new construction and recent satellite images taken by Capella Space said all six settlements appear to be in territory disputed by China and Bhutan - including a contested tract of roughly 110 square kilometres - with little in the way of resources or native population. ""It is Bhutan's policy not to talk about boundary issues in the public,"" Bhutan's foreign ministry said in response to questions from Reuters. The ministry declined to comment further. The construction suggests that China is bent on resolving its border claims by giving its ambitions concrete form, said the experts and one Indian defence source. China's foreign ministry said the construction is ""entirely for the improvement of the working and living conditions of the local people."" ""It is within China's sovereignty to carry out normal construction activities on its own territory,"" the ministry said. The ministry declined to comment further. The villages also offer Beijing some strategic value, two of the experts say. The new construction is 9 to 27km from the Doklam area at the junction of the borders of India, Bhutan and China, where Indian and Chinese troops were locked in standoff for more than two months in 2017. The settlements would allow China to better control and monitor far-flung areas, and potentially use them to establish security-focused installations, according to one expert and the Indian defence source. India's foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Bhutan, a country of less than 800,000 people, has been negotiating with Beijing for almost four decades to settle their 477-km border. At issue for Bhutan is not just territorial integrity, but also concerns over the potential security implications for India, which is the Himalayan kingdom's main ally and economic partner. The Bhutanese foreign ministry said Bhutan and China had agreed during the latest round of boundary negotiations in April 2021 to speed up the process of resolving their differences. It declined to discuss the details of the plan to do so. ""All issues are discussed between Bhutan and China within the framework of the Boundary Talks,"" the ministry said. ""China's village building across the claimed Bhutan border appears to be designed to force Bhutan to yield to Chinese demands in their border negotiations, now in their 24th round after 37 years,"" said Robert Barnett, a professorial research associate at SOAS University of London, who is an expert on Tibet and has studied the China-Bhutan border closely. BORDER VILLAGES The settlements appear part of a plan Beijing made public in 2017 to build more than 600 villages in border areas in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR), which lies on the Chinese side of the disputed border, said Barnett and M. Taylor Fravel, director of the Security Studies Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Fravel said the construction indicated China likely wanted to consolidate its control and improve infrastructure in border areas. The Chinese-controlled TAR was established in 1965, six years after the Dalai Lama fled Tibet in the wake of a failed uprising against Chinese rule. Some of the villages near the border are built where there has been no previous construction. China's government gives residents subsidies to settle there, Barnett said. ""All the cross-border villages in the western Bhutan sector are sited in areas where no natural village would be found, since these areas are barely habitable,"" he said. CHICKEN'S NECK Control over the remote Doklam plateau would potentially give China greater access to the adjoining ""Chicken's Neck"" area, a strategic strip of land that connects India to its northeastern region. India shares an unsettled 3,500-km border with China. Troops from both countries remain deployed near each other in a separate border dispute in the Ladakh region - about 1,100km from Doklam - where they clashed in hand-to-hand combat in 2020. India has been closely monitoring Chinese construction along its borders, the Indian defence source said, declining to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. The satellite imagery suggests that neither India nor Bhutan has responded on the ground to China's construction activities, Biggers said. Nathan Ruser, a researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute research organisation, added that it would be a challenge for India and Bhutan to counter the Chinese construction. ""Any action taken against these Chinese installations would necessarily put civilian populations at risk,"" Ruser said. ""It limits the ways in which India and Bhutan are able to combat Chinese encroachment into disputed territories.""
