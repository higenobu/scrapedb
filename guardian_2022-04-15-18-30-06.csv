4/15/2022,"Plant sunflowers and lavender in your garden this spring to reverse the decline of previously common garden species, the RSPB has urged the British public. The bird charity has launched a “nature on your doorstep” campaign to highlight that UK gardens and balconies combined cover 4,000sq km, an area more than twice the size of Greater London. Together these connected habitats could help reverse the fortunes of species including starlings, bumblebees and hedgehogs. While decades ago, all of these species were abundant, they are facing threats due to habitat loss and the changing nature of agriculture. Starling numbers have fallen by two-thirds in Britain since the mid-1970s, populations of half of our bumblebee species are falling, and hedgehog numbers have crashed from 30 million to an estimated 1 million since the 1950s across England, Wales, and Scotland. The charity suggests growing sunflowers that provide a veritable buffet of seeds that last through late summer to early autumn, and are especially enjoyed by birds. They also recommend cornfield annuals, foxgloves and and say lavender is another good option as it is rich with nectar for bees, so one of the better choices to support pollinators. There are several helpful lists of plants to help out wildlife, and some seed and plant sellers have special labels for particularly insect-friendly species. Standout favourites include Verbena Bonariensis, Meadow’s crane-bill geranium, Nepeta, wild marjoram, and buddleia. A YouGov survey commissioned by the RSPB has revealed that three-quarters of people are now doing at least something in their garden or outside space to help wildlife (with 19% trying a lot, 30% trying a fair amount, and 26% trying a little). Adrian Thomas, the RSPB’s wildlife gardening expert, said: “I’m thrilled to hear how many people are now taking steps to help wildlife in their gardens and outdoor spaces. It feels like a movement is under way in which people are recognising that our gardens can be wonderful, shared spaces for us and for wildlife, to the benefit of all. “To play your part, the best and easiest place to start is to grow more plants. They provide varied, healthy food sources, and offer shelter and nesting spots. And the lovely thing is that lots of plants that are good for wildlife are also beautiful, colourful and richly scented, making outdoor spaces more welcoming, relaxing, and interesting for all of us to enjoy. So this Easter weekend, why not give planting a go, maybe starting with some wildflower seeds? They produce beautiful flowers in just a few weeks, and you’ll be surprised at how quickly you see pollinators buzzing into your garden!” Sunflowers – beautiful and easy to grow from seed, these classic flowers are great for pollinators and are a great food source for birds when they set seed. Cornfield annuals – for just a couple of pounds you can have the glow of red poppies and blue cornflowers within weeks. Mini-meadow – just let parts of your lawn grow for a few months, or even better until late summer, and be rewarded with drifts of clovers and other meadow flowers. Lavender – the familiar lovely-smelling herb that’s brilliant for bees and butterflies. Foxgloves – tall purple, pink and white flowers that are bee magnets.",News/Environment,"Plant sunflowers and lavender to save garden species, says RSPB",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/15/plant-sunflowers-and-lavender-to-save-garden-species-says-rspb
4/15/2022,"Boris Johnson is reputedly a politician with a Lazarus-like ability to overcome perpetual scandal, charm his critics and survive bruising stories that would sink his rivals. But how may this most serious misdeed of his political career ultimately play out? The most perfect scenario for Johnson is that the only fixed-penalty notice he receives for Partygate is the one for a short birthday gathering – one that Tory whips and spinners have tried to portray as an overly punitive approach by the Met police. Even for a politician with as much luck as Johnson, that would seem far-fetched, given at least three of the most overt apparent breaches are yet to be investigated. But once MPs have accepted a law-breaking PM once, it is easier to do it again, a fact the Welsh secretary, Simon Hart, made explicit on Thursday morning. If Johnson can get through a week of parliamentary outrage and convince MPs he was unclear about the nature of the gatherings because they took place in the workplace that is also his home, he may wriggle out of claims he misled parliament. He could also dodge damage from Sue Gray’s final report if it does not reveal substantially more than the media coverage – MPs will see it as old news. Tory MPs are already uneasy about deposing a prime minister in the midst of the barbaric scenes in Ukraine and a further escalatory attack by Russia would also make them more nervous about moving against Johnson. “If Russia uses chemical weapons when we are in the midst of a contest, who will provide the leadership to make some incredibly important choices?” one MP said. “That’s what keeps me awake at night over this.” The Conservatives may also do better in the local elections than expected because the bar is low. Labour already holds a great deal of the seats up for grabs this time and may not be able to hail masses of gains. There are some councils too where the Tories say they are optimistic they can make gains – notably Sunderland, which would have symbolic “red wall” significance. A huge boost would be a win for the Tories in the Wakefield byelection, which Labour are widely expected to win. Should Johnson survive beyond those polls, it is easy to see him cruising to Tory conference and on to the next election. It is widely expected in Downing Street that the prime minister will receive at least three more fines – perhaps as many as six in total. With each disclosure, increasing numbers of Conservative MPs could reach their limit and call for the prime minister to go. But even the most hardened rebel MPs admit there is some way to go before 54 letters are reached – the threshold for Sir Graham Brady to call a vote of no confidence in the PM in his capacity as chair of the backbench 1922 Committee. With a slow pace of disclosures from the Met police, those letters could remain a trickle rather than a flood. Just two MPs – Nigel Mills and Craig Whittaker – added their names to those calling for Johnson’s resignation after he was fined and only Mills said he would submit a letter. And at least two have been withdrawn, from Andrew Bridgen and Douglas Ross. At the local elections, with still no sign of the Gray report, the Tories may still suffer losses but do just enough to be able to spin the story of the night as Labour’s failure to make enough gains. Equally, Labour could win Wakefield but only with a small swing on a low turnout. Though that might be frustrating for Labour in the short term, this kind of scenario – described by one Tory official as a “long slow death march” – may arguably most benefit Labour in the longer term – a prime minister dogged by scandal but with internal opponents too weak to replace him. One of the people who held Johnson’s fate in his hands this week was Rishi Sunak – who could have resigned after receiving his own fixed-penalty notice and denounced the chaos of Johnson’s administration. After his own month of difficult headlines, the chancellor opted to stay put. But any further pressure on Sunak could push him to his limit – especially amid rumours Johnson intends to demote him on the advice of the strategist Lynton Crosby. His departure could trigger further resignations from other uneasy junior ministers. No 10 sources believe Johnson could be hit with fines for six separate events, with an embarrassing racking up of costs. The final release of the Gray report may also mean egregious personal lockdown breaches by the PM come to light for the first time – or evidence that he agreed to events being held in advance, which would suggest he lied about perceiving them as work events. It could also potentially force the resignation of senior officials – perhaps his cabinet secretary, Simon Case. Johnson may also face a bruising time in parliament in the coming weeks. The Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, is expected to allow a vote of MPs on an investigation into whether Johnson misled the House of Commons – and they could vote to hand an investigation to the standards and privileges committee. Any significant rebellion by Tories could be hugely damaging – and prompt more letters of no confidence. The Conservatives could then suffer a set of shock local election results, perhaps losing totemic London councils such as Wandsworth or Westminster. Coupled with a sharp drop in the national polls, that could be enough to force a larger contingent of MPs from the party’s One Nation group to move against Johnson, enough to trigger a vote of no confidence. Labour could win Wakefield with a big swing, enough to unnerve “red wall” backbenchers to help depose him. Ultimately the decider in a vote will be how safe Tories believe their seats will be under Johnson. If they conclude a successor would have a better chance of retaining them, some MPs have suggested more than half of backbenchers and even a third of the ministerial payroll could vote against Johnson.",News/Politics,"Good, bad and the ugly: how Boris Johnson’s future may play out",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/15/boris-johnson-future-play-out-good-bad-ugly
4/15/2022,"The brother of a British aid worker killed by an Islamic State cell known as “the Beatles” said the conviction of one of their members had closed “an eight-year chapter of pain” for his family. Mike Haines, whose brother David Haines was captured by militants in Syria in March 2013, welcomed the conviction of El Shafee Elsheikh, 33, in a US court, saying it had “provided us with some closure”. David Haines’s murder in 2014 by the cell, whose nickname was due to their British accents, was used by them for propaganda. Elsheikh, from London, and fellow cell member Alexanda Kotey will be sentenced later this month. The cell – also said to be made up of Mohammed Emwazi, the ringleader known as “Jihadi John” who was killed in a drone strike in Raqqu, Syria, in 2015, and Aine Davis, who was convicted by a Turkish court of being a member of a terrorist group – was thought to be responsible for the brutal killings of several western and Japanese captives, including Britons Alan Henning and Haines. The two British victims did not form part of the indictment against Elsheikh and Kotey, the latter having already admitted his role in the atrocities, because the court was focusing only on US victims. Elsheikh was convicted of eight counts relating to four US hostages: James Foley, Steven Sotloff, Peter Kassig, and Kayla Mueller, after a trial at a US district court in Alexandria, Virginia. It is believed the two may yet face court in the UK for the deaths of British nationals. Mike Haines, who runs the education charity Global Acts Of Unity in honour of his 44-year-old brother, said in a statement: “While nothing can truly compensate for the hole David’s murder left in our hearts, the verdict provides us with some closure and ensures that all three surviving members of the gang involved in my brother’s murder have now faced justice.” He added:“This unanimous judgment is a triumph for society over ills like terrorism and helps differentiate us from the hateful, divisive ideologies that fuel these individuals. It must also act as a warning to anyone else seduced by the false glamour of extremism.” Speaking after the conviction, Bethany Haines, the daughter of David Haines, told BBC One: “It was a lot more emotional than I expected. I expected to be happy, excited, but it’s the realisation that he’s guilty, what he’s done to all the families, all the hostages. “I’ve not slept a full night’s sleep probably since my dad was killed in 2014 so hopefully tonight I’ll get a full night’s sleep.”",News/UK news,Brother of murdered Briton welcomes IS cell member’s conviction,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/15/brother-murdered-briton-is-cell-conviction-david-haines
4/15/2022,"Amid the highest UK inflation for 30 years and a cost of living crisis, some people who pay for their energy usage by direct debt may not feel the 54% rise of the price cap until their next bill lands. However, for the 4.5 million people using prepayment meters the impact of the 1 April hike is already being felt. They also face a higher annual price cap for average use of £2,017 rather than £1,971 for those who pay by monthly direct debit. Prepayment meters “trap people in fuel poverty” by charging above-average rates, according to research by the charity Church Action on Poverty. Low-income households make up the majority of users and the huge hike has prompted fears that more people will be forced to choose between food and fuel as poorer families spend a higher proportion of their income on energy. The government has come under fire in recent weeks for failing to do enough to support households about to be hammered by the increase. Analysis from the consultancy firm Cornwall Insight estimates the cap could be raised again later this year to £2,600. The Guardian spoke to four people with prepayment meters on what the price rise means for them. Tim Hooper, 50, Norfolk When Tim Hooper moved into a housing association property in Norfolk in 2019, it seemed like a new chapter after two years living in hostels. However, because he agreed a debt relief order while homeless, he was unable to secure an energy contract and must use a prepayment meter. After the energy price cap hike, the 50-year-old says he now expects to spend roughly £32 a week of his monthly £325 universal credit on energy costs – almost 40% of his income after housing costs. Until this month he paid about £22 a week. “I’m really quite frightened,” he says. “There are times previously when I’ve run out of credit on my meter and just had to sit in the dark and I’m worried that might be more frequent … You try to live when the sun’s up.” It was “a real kick in the teeth” when the government removed the £20 [universal credit] uplift, says Hooper. “With the likes of the prime minister and the chancellor, they are so out of touch. It can’t be that they’re ignorant of what people on low incomes experience – it must be that they just don’t care.” Emma Rehling, 32, Tower Hamlets For Emma Rehling, who part-owns and part-rents a flat in Tower Hamlets, east London, gas prices have more than doubled. The 32-year-old, who lives alone and works in communications, says the amount she tops up her meter has surged from about £30 a month to £70, even after she has slightly reduced usage. Because her block of flats has a communal boiler – which also services a local school and mosque – occupants are charged a commercial rate for their prepaid meter, making Rehling one of up to 500,000 people losing out on consumer protections like the price cap. Her communal boiler rate rocketed in February by almost 250%, from 4.05p to 13.94 a kilowatt hour, documents seen by the Guardian show. Electricity for each flat is non-communal. “It’s the little things, I thought I would leave behind worries about putting the heating on as a student, but I’m in my 30s still worrying,” she says. “I’m lucky as I live on my own, and it’s far worse for families. But also I don’t have anyone to fall back on.” Rehling says the situation has led to anxiety about the future as it’s impossible to save for emergencies. “My whole salary is gone at the end of each month. It’s really depressing.” Ben, 47, Birmingham Ben, a 47-year-old in Birmingham, has seen his electricity and gas rise by an estimated £250 a year, according to estimates from his energy supplier seen by the Guardian. His standing charge also increased to about 90p a day. “So I’m paying over £300 a year before I’ve even turned on the light,” he says. The rises pile yet another cost of living expense on to his shoulders, which he says he will struggle to cover with his ​​employment and support allowance disability benefit. “I’m trying to spend £1 for food a day,” he says, relying on anti-food waste apps and buying yellow-sticker reduced items. Ben, who asked for his full name not to be disclosed because he does not want friends “to know how bad it is”, says the threat of further energy price cap rises later this year loom ominously. “Once you’ve cut back everything you can – when you’re spending £1 on food a day and you’re no longer even taking the bus – how are you going to cut back again? There’s nothing left to cut.” Zoe Woodward, 30, south-east London Anticipating the price rises to come, Zoe Woodward, a 30-year-old in south-east London working at a university, splashed out to savour her old rate. Her electricity rate is climbing 44% from 20.4p to 29.4p a kWh, documents show, and her gas rate is jumping 82% from 4.1p to 7.5p a kWh. “We bought a bit of a reserve while the rates were still lower,” she says. Typically Woodward would top up £40 total for her electricity and gas meters – to cover up to two weeks of costs at the one-bedroom flat she rents with her partner – but she plugged in £120 before the rise to save money. “We’re lucky we’re in a position to suddenly buy a load more energy,” she says. “But it’s a scary time, everywhere you look there are headlines about housing, bills, food and travel costs all going up, it can feel overwhelming.” Woodward’s landlord is also increasing rent by £75 next month. “It feels like the walls are closing in. I’m not sure that you could print what I’d say to the prime minister or the chancellor. They could be doing so much more.”",Lifestyle/Money,‘I’m frightened’: prepaid meter users feel early impact of price hike,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/15/im-frightened-prepaid-meter-users-feel-early-impact-of-price-hike
4/15/2022,"When covert video footage emerged of Boris Johnson leaving St Thomas’ hospital in south London after being treated for Covid there two years ago, I wondered if, being a VIP, he had received a different standard of care from the average patient. I can safely say that had Johnson – or better yet, Sajid Javid – experienced anything like I did during an almost unimaginable, yet very real, 80-hour stay in A&E last week, the NHS just might be in line for some positive changes in the future, rather than its inevitable deeper plunge into crisis. I saw first-hand over the course of three long nights and four days just what a catastrophic predicament the NHS is in. I’ve got stage-four cancer, and when my condition rapidly declined at home last week, both my GP and a specialist cancer care nurse urged me to go to A&E. A previous visit had left me stranded on a wheelchair outside a toilet in a corridor for more than seven hours before I discharged myself. I begged for other options. But there were none. All my worst fears came true. The A&E was so understaffed that patients were often unable to access adequate, let alone good or outstanding care – through no fault of the staff, the vast majority of whom clearly care deeply about their jobs and their patients. The hospital was in “black status” when I was there, meaning there were no beds available at all. The staff themselves were astonished by the length of my stay in A&E without being transferred to a bed on a ward. I vacillated between utter anguish, mental breakdown (sleep is impossible; no visitors are allowed) and desperate action (firing off emails to every single medic I could think of, including the head of the trust). Some of my vital medications were delayed by hours, and I was left drenched in my own urine for about 40 minutes. And I was one of the lucky ones. Everyone is vulnerable in hospital, but the vast majority of patients there were among the most powerless in society – elderly, frail, and many clearly with dementia. They shouted out helplessly for nurses, but were often not heard due to the chaos. Security guards and police were a regular presence dealing with disruptive and gravely disturbed patients; people on trolleys took up every available inch of space. Eventually, on the last day, I was seen by what felt like every single doctor and admin person in the hospital, including the head of nursing – something a friend who works in an A&E in London said she had never heard of happening before. The doctors had a flurry of information and diagnoses for me; a rare blood disease had finally been pinpointed; gastric and respiratory specialists wanted to say their piece; and I was promised a ward bed by the end of the day – although that quickly changed to being discharged. It did not make up for the previous four days when I did not see a single doctor, except at the point of admission. On my final stretch, having requested but not received my pain and anti-sickness medication, which meant I was unable to eat, I was taken to a waiting area where hospital transport would, eventually, take me home. At the point of total, traumatic breakdown, I begged for my medicine – only to find there was just one nurse charged with medicating 30 people. Another nurse came in and said the hospital was as bad as he had ever seen it. It was, he said, “dangerously busy”. Apparently, 500 people had come through A&E that day, and it was only about 8pm. When the nurse finally approached to give me my medication, a standoff ensued. I flinched, and warned her it would hurt going into my cannula. My veins had given up. She couldn’t give it to me then, she said. Maybe a direct injection instead. “No, put it in the cannula,” I begged, “they don’t care in A&E”. In my highly emotional state, I meant that they know it hurts and they do it regardless. She stepped back from me, put her hand on her chest and looked genuinely offended. “We do care,” she said. “This is A&E. We do care.” And she did. She summoned a healthcare assistant to hold my hand and try to distract me by asking me about my daughter I was so desperate to go home to. Her no-nonsense manner melted away and she sang to me while putting my medicine through my worn-out veins as tears rolled down my cheeks. Shortly afterwards I was taken home – the best journey of my life. I am just one patient among many. There are millions of similarly vulnerable, desperately ill people in hospitals up and down the country. The spectre of disaster hovering over our healthcare system can be traced back directly to 2010, when Tory budget cuts slashed training places for medics, leading us neatly to today’s dire staff shortages. Add in Brexit and rising coronavirus cases – last week an estimated 5 million people in the UK had the disease, patients are pouring through A&E doors, and there is no glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel. Many may end up in grave danger thanks to this government making it nearly impossible for dedicated, hard-working and underpaid staff to translate their care and attention more thoroughly to them.

4/15/2022,"When a trio of paying customers and their astronaut chaperone were blasted off to the International Space Station, their voyage was touted as a milestone for the commercialisation of spaceflight. For the Michelin-starred Spanish chef José Andrés, however, the recently departed mission ushered in another – albeit more niche – breakthrough: the first time paella was sent into orbit. “Astronauts from different countries and nationalities and backgrounds – and they are all going to be eating, at once, paella Valenciana,” he said on social media. “And this makes me so proud.” Andrés is the latest in a string of top chefs around the world who have turned their attention to space food, seeking to push fine dining beyond a frontier long marked by offerings such as dehydrated versions of mac ’n’ cheese or prawn cocktail. Among the first to pioneer chef-approved space food were the renowned French chefs Thierry Marx and Alain Ducasse, each of whom carved out a repertoire of space-ready classics dishes that ranged from beef bourguignon to almond tarts. Some of Spain’s top chefs have gone further, seeking to bring their brand of boundary-pushing cuisine into space. Last year, Ángel León of the three Michelin-starred restaurant Aponiente proffered to Nasa a nutrient-dense dish of rice cooked in collagen extracted from fish scales and flavoured with freeze-dried plankton. Andoni Luis Aduriz of the top-ranked Mugaritz, meanwhile, has sought to recast freeze-dried creations such as a marshmallow-like cauliflower with strawberry cream as the perfect space food, marrying nutrition and functionality while also playing to a sense of taste that can at times be dulled by microgravity conditions. Aduriz pointed to the commercialisation of space to explain the interest. “Until now, space travel was done by men and women who were very trained to have a spartan spirit and mentally prepared to live in extreme situations,” he said. With companies such as Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic looking to court deep-pocketed passengers, this profile is set to change. “We’re talking about people who will likely not want to do without anything and who will want to eat well,” said Aduriz. He saw the discussion on space travel as one that would intensify in the coming years. “I’m convinced that our species, especially in the long term, will be spending much more time in space. And they will colonise some spaces,” said Aduriz. “And then food will be an important tool related to the mental health of the people who are there.” The entry of chefs into an area long dominated by food scientists, however, is far from a seamless transition. The team behind Andrés spent more than a year tweaking the paella and secreto de cerdo y pisto – a cut of Iberian pork with tomatoes, onions, eggplant and peppers – that were sent to space, said Charisse Grey, who leads research and development for the chef’s ThinkFoodGroup. “Food scientists think a lot about nutrition, they think a lot about calories,” said Grey. “My goal is to meet your palate’s expectations for food.” The rules were strict; dishes had to be nutritious, survive microbe-killing sterilisation of 121C (252F), and largely avoid the use of free-floating liquids. “Things that are crumbly, like cookies and chips, won’t make it up there because if there’s little crumbs that come off it while you’re eating, they just float into space and can get caught up in the air filtration systems and create issues,” said Grey. There was also no escaping the foil-laminated pouch used to serve the meals. “I recall one of my first conversations that I had with Nasa and some of the food scientists … They were, like, ‘You have to let go of the feeling that the food has to look good.’” While the team had yet to hear any feedback from the crew, Grey said she had been impressed by how the dishes turned out. “I won’t say that they’re perfect and I won’t say that they’re exactly what you would get out of a paella pan, as you can’t mimic the actual cooking process of the paella pan or the stew process of a pot,” said Grey. “But they’re probably some of the best meals I’ve had out of a pouch.”",News/World news,Paella that is out of this world: Spain’s top chefs take space food to next level,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/15/paella-spain-top-chefs-space-food-michelin-commerical-travel

Could this hack help? The testI like pillow sprays but some just smell nice while others seem to knock me out. The success of this hack depends on using an effective oil mixer and good oil (quality lavender oil is proven to reduce blood pressure and heart rate). You’ll also need a 100ml spray bottle (the brown glass ones have apothecary appeal) and a tiny funnel. Use the funnel to half fill the bottle with unflavoured vodka, so the formula dries when spritzed and doesn’t stain. Next, add 10 drops each of lavender essential oil (I use Neal’s Yard) and chamomile oil (some studies say it, too, helps promote sleep). I finished by topping up the bottle with filtered water, and shaking.

4/15/2022,"It was 1593 and John Donne was 21: tall, dark and exquisitely moustached. He was studying law at the Inns of Court in central London, and was living high. He excelled at the business of frivolity and was elected Master of the Revels, in charge of putting on pageantry and wild parties for his fellow scholars, with raucous singing and drunken dancing of the galliard. (The dance, which involved great leaps and kicks and spins, was Queen Elizabeth’s favourite: she was said, even in her 50s, to dance “six or seven galliards in a morning”.) He was writing, for a group of male friends, rakish poetry that was beginning to make him known. But as the year went on, the plague was spreading: the theatres were ordered to close, the bear-baiting to cease. In the streets officials wielded 3ft-long marshal wands, to swat at people who weren’t social distancing. Donne wrote to a friend a lament for the city’s swagger: Now pleasure’s dearth our city doth possess:Our theatres are fill’d with emptiness;As lank and thin is ev’ry street and wayAs a woman delivered yesterday. If you fell ill, your house was boarded up with your whole family inside it for 20 days. The illness came on so speedily that they said a man could “dine with his friends and sup with his ancestors”. One man, the playwright Thomas Dekker wrote, “felt a pricking in his arm … and upon this, plucking up his sleeve, he called to his wife to stay; there was no need to fetch him anything from the market; for see (quoth he) I am marked; and so showing God’s Token, died a few minutes later.” Symptoms were fast and cruel: a racing pulse was followed by buboes – hard, red plague sores, some as large as an apple. More wealthy students retreated to the countryside as the plague advanced; others, with nowhere to go, stayed in London. Donne was one such man; his brother Henry, just arrived at the Inns of Court, was another. It had always been Donne’s job to look after Henry – his younger, more vulnerable brother. In the spring of 1593, Henry’s lodgings were raided: he had been hiding a young Catholic priest in his chambers. The penalty for practising as a priest was death. Henry was thrown in jail, through which the plague was raging. Donne did not immediately visit his brother. He delayed just a few days – he didn’t have days. Almost as soon as he arrived in Newgate, Henry became feverish, tortured by buboes. He died fast. He was 19 years old. Henry’s death was to be one in a series of horrors that battered Donne’s life. Born into a family hounded for their Catholicism, he lost six children, as well as his wife, Anne, who died during childbirth at the age of 33. An attempt to be a swashbuckling privateer ended in him watching sailors leap burning into the sea to drown. He thought, relentlessly, of killing himself: he wrote the first full-length treatise on suicide in the English language. There are few poets who knew greater sorrow. But despite or perhaps because of it, there are also few who insisted so passionately on awe. A single human soul, he wrote, is larger than the world itself: “It is too little to call Man a little world … Man [is] the giant, and the world the dwarf.” He kept insisting – in his poetry and later, when he became the dean of St Paul’s, in his sermons, and on his deathbed – that life is an astonishment, and it behoves us to be astonished. If Henry’s death changed Donne, it was to make his work only more intense, more urgent, more defiantly witty. His best verse is a triumphant call to life: it is desire, sincerity, joke, all bound into one. It’s there, for instance, in A Valediction, Forbidding Mourning: the lovers are imagined as the two feet of a pair of mathematical compasses, joined eternally at the base: If they be two, they are two soAs stiff twin compasses are two:Thy soul, the fixed foot, makes no showTo move, but doth, if th’other do;And though it in the centre sit,Yet when the other far doth roam,It leans, and hearkens after it,And grows erect as it comes home. His poetry loves the body, because Donne, unlike so many of the poets who went before him, never pretended not to have a body – “grows erect as it comes home” is a pun so obvious it might as well be a little sketch of a penis. He revelled in the real fleeting delight of it: he wrote in To His Mistress Going to Bed: Full nakedness! All joys are due to thee:As souls unbodied, bodies unclothed must beTo taste whole joys. Donne burst out from a poetic tradition that watched him, dismayed, as he laid waste their rules and traditions. Ben Jonson wrote that Donne, “for not keeping of accent, deserved hanging”. Many other poets of the time were still playing the “my lady is a perfect dove” game. Think of Walter Raleigh writing to Queen Elizabeth: A flower of Love’s own planting,A pattern kept by Nature,For Beauty, form and statureWhen she would frame a darling. Donne saw that we need more than that: words that encompass the strangeness and mad sweep of human desire, human hunger. He summoned fleas, mathematical instruments, mythical fish, snakes, planets, kings. He chastised the sun for rising on his lover’s bed: Busy old fool, unruly Sun,Why dost thou thusThrough windows, and through curtains call on us?Must to thy motions lovers’ seasons run? He had, he wrote, “an hydroptique immoderate desire of humane learning”: a labyrinthical mind. Searching for a way to note down the majestically improbable problem of being alive, he became a wild inventor of words, a neologismist. He accounts for the first recorded use of about 340 words in the Oxford English Dictionary, including beauteousness, emancipation, enripen, fecundate and jig. Donne is often said to be a difficult poet. But if he is difficult, it is the difficulty of someone who wants you to read harder, to pay better attention. And when you have read and reread them, the poems open – they salute you. The pleasures of Donne are akin to the pleasures of cracking a safe: there is gold inside. And besides, why should it be easy? Very little that is worth having is easy. We are not, he told us, easy: we are both a miracle and a disaster; our lives deserve pity and wonder, careful loving attention, the full untrammelled exuberance of our imagination. When you have known vast horror, and still found glory, you do not compare loves to doves. You write: “Taste whole joys.” Donne knew what it was to be ruthlessly alone. He knew dread, and fear: and that’s why we can believe him when he tells us of their opposite, of ravishments and of love.

4/15/2022,"While the $3m (£2.3m) wedding of David and Victoria Beckham’s eldest son, Brooklyn, and Nicola Peltz, the daughter of billionaire businessman Nelson, might not be an obvious place to look for a modern approach to marriage, the groom’s decision to take his wife’s name has prompted praise from some quarters. He is said to have opted to change his middle name, meaning his surname is still Beckham. And although growing numbers of men want to double-barrel their name, or take on their wife’s surnames, the move by Peltz Beckham has highlighted an archaic rule that means it is more administratively complicated than the other way round. Men in England and Wales who take their wife’s surnames, or people in same-sex marriages wanting to share a surname, are required to change their name via deed poll, whereas the change is automatic for a woman when she has a marriage licence.Keir Harper-Thorpe, 54, wanted to double-barrel his surname when he married his wife to share a name with his stepson and avoid awkward questions about their relationship. He also wanted to send a signal to family who disapproved of the marriage that he and his partner are “us together equal”. He has struggled financially and balked at the cost of changing his name via deed poll, and can’t meet the requirement for a reference from someone who owns property who has known him for 10 years, which means he has been unable to update his name on his passport or with his bank. “I wouldn’t say it’s a luxury. I think sometimes official places need to catch up with how people in society are living,” he said.Jon Hutchinson, 33, wanted to take his wife’s name to express “our discomfort with some of the traditions which just felt very patriarchal”, including the connotations of ownership associated with women taking on their husband’s name.He said friends had welcomed the couple’s choice, but he has had to challenge authorities to have his new surname recognised, after choosing not to change it via deed poll out of principle. “I called and kicked up a fuss and talked about how it’s probably not adhering to the Equalities Act to say that there are different standards.” Amy Foweather, a family solicitor at Harrowells Ltd, said the difference was rooted in a common law assumption dating back hundreds of years that a wife becomes the property of her husband upon marriage, which some institutions still follow. “It became acceptable for the marriage certificate to be good evidence of a name change for the wife, but not for the husband, as they never did it and it would have been extremely frowned upon or forbidden within society. “Whilst there may be some common law requirement buried deep down in the archives, the reality is, men have to ‘prove’ a change of name on marriage because historically they never did it and women don’t have to prove it because historically they had no choice,” she said. Simon Duncan, emeritus professor at the University of Bradford, said the deed poll requirement served as an “administration barrier” and that it would be a good idea to remove it to speed up “glacial” progress away from the cultural association of the husband’s surname with a “proper family”. Alternative choices are “still pretty uncommon”, according to Rachael Robnett, an associate professor at the University of Nevada. “I think we will see a bit more flexibility in the next 10-20 years, but not much. In part, this is because heterosexual women and men continue to encounter stigma if they don’t align with the traditional arrangement,” she said.Friends and family sometimes view couples who take the wife’s surname as less committed, or perceive the husband to have less power in the relationship, she said.“This is probably why some women encounter pressure from their husbands to change their last name after getting married. It’s really hard to resist these entrenched norms to the point that some people don’t ever seriously consider other options,” she said.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Brooklyn Peltz Beckham taking wife’s name highlights sexist anomaly in law,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/15/brooklyn-peltz-beckham-wife-surname-sexist-anomaly-in-law
4/15/2022,"Harry Potter, and JK Rowling’s wider Wizarding World, are incredibly popular in China. So much so that the nation’s Ministry of Education added the tales of Harry, Ron and Hermione’s schooldays to an official list of recommended reading for primary and secondary school students in 2017. The first two Fantastic Beasts movies made more than £100m at the Chinese box office, and new episode, Secrets of Dumbledore, is also expected to perform well there. But when Chinese audiences sit down to find out what it is the heroic Hogwarts headmaster has been keeping to himself, they may find themselves wondering if they’ve been targeted with one of Potter’s famed Confundus charms. For censors have reportedly made the decision to cut all gay references from the movie. These include a line in which Jude Law’s Dumbledore tells evil wizard Gellert Grindelwald (Mads Mikkelsen) he once went along with his dastardly plans “because I was in love with you”, and another reference to “the summer Gellert and I fell in love”. Rowling has long been keen to let the world know Dumbledore is gay, revealing this detail in 2007 to widespread joy among her readers. Looking back, the revelation seems to have come from another time: one in which Rowling was seen as a paragon of liberal decency and phrases such as “virtue signalling” and “woke” had barely entered the lexicon. However much public perception of her has changed in the meantime, it is clear the author had a good idea of how Dumbledore’s backstory would play out, even before she killed him off in the Potter books. “Dumbledore fell in love with Grindelwald, and that added to his horror when Grindelwald showed himself to be what he was,” Rowling told an audience during a US tour in 2007. “To an extent, do we say it excused Dumbledore a little more, because falling in love can blind us to an extent, but he met someone as brilliant as he was and, rather like Bellatrix, he was very drawn to this brilliant person and horribly, terribly let down.” This is essentially the set-up of Secrets of Dumbledore, and (spoilers alert) it leads to a confusing situation in which Dumbledore is unable to stymie Grindelwald’s efforts to begin a war between the wizarding world and unwitting Muggles, even though he really, really wants to, due to a blood pact the two sorcerers made in their youth. Instead, the headmaster asks Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) and assorted wizards and witches (along with Muggle Jacob Kowalski, played by Dan Fogler) to do it for him – except none of them are able to know what the full plan is because Jacob’s ex, Queenie (a legilimens, or mind-reader), has gone over to the dark side and would expose them all to Grindelwald if they did. It is all horrendously confusing, even if you do know that Dumbledore and Grindelwald were once lovers. Without that essential titbit, it is going to make no sense at all. Which is a great pity for those in China, because Secrets of Dumbledore is a half-decent yarn, which very nearly gets the Wizarding World movies back on track after the half-cocked Crimes of Grindelwald. It’s certainly not the first time China’s censors have baffled audiences. In February, the Chinese streaming platform Tencent Video was forced to restore the original ending to Fight Club after a backlash prompted by an amended Chinese edition in which it was stated at the film’s denouement that police had “rapidly figured out the whole plan and arrested all criminals”. In 2018, censors banned the release of Christopher Robin outright, because of the way the portly bear of very little brain Winnie-the-Pooh has been compared to the nation’s president, Xi Jinping. Warner Bros insists that, despite the cuts to Secrets of Grindelwald, “the spirit of the film remains intact”. Apparently, while dialogue has been removed, there are still references to the wizardly pair sharing a close youthful bond. In other words, Dumbledore has been placed firmly back in his closet. And really, what is the point of going to see a movie about secrets, if the only really interesting one remains locked in a vault tougher than Gringotts’?",Arts/Film,"Without the gay love story, Fantastic Beasts makes even less sense",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/15/fantastic-beasts-secrets-of-dumbledore-china-gay-censorship
4/15/2022,"When Imran Ahmad Khan was selected as the last-minute Conservative candidate for Wakefield in the 2019 general election, he sold himself as a “local lad”. He made a big deal of being born at the local hospital, where his late father was a doctor and his mum a nurse, and educated at Silcoats, the town’s lesser private school. It was perhaps odd, then, that none of the local Tories seemed to have any idea who he was, with claims he had been “pushed” on to the constituency. He was a stranger even to Nadeem Ahmed, who had been the leader of the Conservative group of Wakefield council since 2014: “Wakefield is a close-knit place. I didn’t know anybody who knew him.” He didn’t even pretend to live locally, giving his address as a Lake District mansion where his mother lived. The Labour party liked to call him “the Windermere candidate”. Khan quickly established a reputation as an eccentric character with a penchant for telling wild tales about his previous life as a counter-terror consultant in some of the most dangerous parts of the world. In his booming voice, his accent more Duke of York than West Yorkshire, he would tell war stories about getting blown up by an IED in Afghanistan – some people were shown the scars he said came from burning shrapnel – and negotiating with the Taliban. He talked proudly of his brothers, Karim and Khalid, who are both high-flying lawyers – Karim is the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court in The Hague and has been in Ukraine this week investigating war crimes. To some, he appeared sometimes to be playing a part, growing an extravagant Kitchener-style moustache and wearing red trousers with rainbow-striped shirts. “On Remembrance Sunday I remember him turning up to the Cenotaph hobbling with a cane, almost as if he himself had been wounded in battle,” said one local politician. “Then the next day you’d see him twirling the cane around and walking normally.” Khan was selected as the Tory candidate a month from polling day after the original choice had to step down because of offensive Facebook posts. Much of what the Guardian has learned about his past casts doubts on whether the Conservative party did proper background checks to establish if he was a fit and proper person to represent them in parliament. The party says it has no record of anyone complaining to it before the election that Khan was a paedophile – the victim in his sex offence trial claimed that he had done so. But it did not respond when asked by the Guardian if he had been vetted. Tony Homewood, a Conservative councillor in Wakefield who acted as Khan’s election agent in 2019 and previously worked as an “execution consultant” in the US to teach prison staff how to hang inmates, said on Twitter that Khan had been “pushed” on the constituency. He claimed that Khan had “applied for the seat originally and was in fact not selected for interview”. He added: “What we might all ask is how candidates are selected and how can the situation come about where someone as wholly inappropriate as Khan can get approved?” Homewood did not respond to a request for an interview. During his two-and-a-half-year spell as Wakefield’s MP, Khan has given differing versions of his CV. He no longer mentions his work for the private intelligence company SCL, parent company of controversial data consultants Cambridge Analytica. But he has made no attempt to hide his job setting up the Syrian Media Centre, the UK propaganda arm of the Syrian government, where he was director of communications and strategy from 2004-05. On his LinkedIn page, he says he “successfully organised the official launch party drawing on my own contacts to ensure that the guests included over 200 leaders drawn from the worlds of media, politics, diplomacy, industry, academia and art (eg. Rt. Hon. Michael Portillo, Sir David Frost).” His now-deleted profile page for the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on foreign affairs claimed that he “worked with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and M&C Saatchi from 2015 to 2018, where he advocated a novel approach to achieve greater political and popular support that might provide solutions to issues affecting the eradication campaign”. But M&C Saatchi insists he worked for them as an external consultant for only one month in 2019. Khan disputes this. In a piece for the Times this week, one of his former parliamentary interns, Felix Mohaupt, claimed Khan told him he had done a postgraduate degree at Georgetown, one of the most prestigious universities in the US. Asked why there is no record of this, Khan said he was due to attend Georgetown but couldn’t because his father died. His lawyers told the Guardian: “We are unable to speculate as to whether Felix misunderstood our client or what was stated, and our client has no recollection of the conversation with him, or indeed of Mr Mohaupt.” One thing missing from his LinkedIn profile is a brief spell at Leeds University, where he started a degree in politics, Russian and parliamentary studies in 1992. Julian Watson, who was on the same course, said of Khan: “He was very full of himself and prone, I think, to exaggerating his achievements. One of the things he used to boast about was having been a special adviser to a president of a former Soviet country. Hardly likely given he was 18 at the time. He dropped out/was pushed out after a few weeks or months. The next time I was aware of him he had just been elected Wakefield MP. I was gobsmacked.” The Guardian has been unable to verify a claim made on his deleted APPG profile that “in the early 1990s [when Khan would have been in his late teens or early twenties] Imran served as Special Advisor to President Stanislav S. Shushkevich of Belarus”. But some of Khan’s wilder claims do appear to have at least some basis in reality. Alex Ulster, the son of the Earl of Gloucester and a former British army officer, said he worked with Khan on counter-extremism projects for the UK Foreign Office between 2008 and 2014, before Khan left to work for the United Nations. Having met in the 1990s when doing a degree in war studies at King’s College in London, in 2010 the pair set up a consultancy called Xain Research and Communication, which had contracts with the British government. Ulster was a little vague about what exactly they did – “you’ll have to ask the Foreign Office”, he said. (The Foreign Office had not responded by the time of publication). But he said Khan used to do what he called “atmospherics”, walking around villages in Pakistan and Afghanistan, finding out what was going on and reporting back to the Foreign Office. “He did a lot of stuff in Afghanistan. It wasn’t for very long, but we did a project where he was meeting people who were Taliban,” he said. “These were village-level people, not the leadership of the organisation or senior leaders … He was not negotiating on behalf of a government or anything of that level. We were doing what was called atmospherics.” Asked to explain, he compared it to a reporter wandering around Wakefield asking about the byelection: “Vox populi. We would feed that back.” He denied they were essentially evidence-gathering. “We would absolutely not call it intelligence, but it’s, you know, the flavour on the streets,” said Ulster. He laughed when asked if Khan was a spy – a persistent rumour in Wakefield. “No, he is not a spy,” he said. “I think I would know if he was a spy.” But he said Khan was “quite ballsy – he went to places I wouldn’t … He was quite committed, you know, to the cause.” The cause being? “Anti-terrorism. And, you know, trying to stop the Pakistanis and Afghans from blowing each other up.” Constituents in Wakefield were less enamoured of their MP, with some complaining that when they went to ask for help they had to sit under a huge portrait of Margaret Thatcher. After his conviction this week, many were outraged when he initially refused calls to stand down. But by Thursday evening the pressure had become too much and he quit, saying he would focus entirely on clearing his name. “As I intend for this to be my only statement, I would like to apologise to my family and community for the humiliation this has caused them,” he wrote. “Questions surrounding sexuality in my community are not trivial, and learning from the press about my orientation, drinking, and past behaviour before I became an MP has not been easy.” helen.pidd@theguardian.com",News/UK news,From Afghan war zone to West Yorkshire: the rise and fall of Imran Ahmad Khan,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/15/from-afghan-war-zone-to-west-yorkshire-the-rise-and-fall-of-imran-ahmad-khan
4/15/2022,"A man has accused Imran Ahmad Khan, the disgraced former Conservative MP, of propositioning him when he was 16. The man, who the Guardian is calling Andrew (not his real name), says he met Khan at a birthday party in Suffolk in August 2015. He claims Khan, then in his early 40s, offered to give him oral sex and to take him to a hotel room to take cocaine and hire a sex worker. Andrew came forward with his story after Khan’s conviction on Monday for sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy after plying him with gin at a party in 2008. Khan announced on Thursday that he would resign, triggering a byelection in the Yorkshire seat of Wakefield. Andrew’s mother, who was also at the party with her partner, told the Guardian that she told Khan to stay away from her son after he told her about the oral sex proposition. The mother’s partner said he too told Khan to back off and that it was “inappropriate” to talk to Andrew in that way. Another adult party guest told the Guardian he also admonished Khan in a similar vein. Another person who was working at the event said he remembered being told about the incident in the aftermath and that it was “talk of the party”. The event took place in marquees and tents in a field in Suffolk. Andrew says he first spotted Khan sitting by a campfire looking “off his face”. He claims he asked Khan if he was OK, and that Khan said his friends had given him “far too many pills”. The next day Andrew joined a group of people who were listening to Khan tell a story about working as a mediator between the UK government and the Taliban. “He said he’d been shot at and blown up while travelling in a vehicle which was hit by an IED [improvised explosive device] and then he lifted his shirt up to show us some scars,” said Andrew. “He asked me to touch them and I put my finger in one of the divots.” He claims Khan then asked him about his sexuality. Andrew said that he was straight, only for Khan to reply that he thought sexuality was “on a spectrum”. He claims Khan later offered to give him “the best blowjob of your life”. The teenager then told his mother what happened, prompting interventions from her and her partner. Khan later complained to Andrew about being “told off”, and asked why he had told his mother. “I told him that he had made me feel uncomfortable and that it was a bit weird. He asked why weird, and I said, well, I’m only 16,” said Andrew. “He replied: ‘that’s OK, you’re legal’.” Andrew claims Khan then asked him if he had ever done “DP” (double penetration). He said no. He alleges Khan then said something like “why don’t we hang out and have some fun?” before offering to book them a hotel in Henley, “buy lots of cocaine and a prostitute and ‘fuck all weekend’”. At the time, Andrew said he felt “really uncomfortable. I didn’t know how to take it. I was only 16.” Afterwards, he said he made light of it with friends and did not think much about it, until this week when he saw Khan had been convicted of sexually abusing a 15-year-old. Andrew said: “The story popped up on the BBC app and I saw a picture of him and thought ‘fuck’, it’s him. And Christ, this guy is an MP. He’s the probably the furthest thing away from the sort of person anyone wants to represent them, a paedophile who offers a 16-year-old drugs and tries to get them to shag a prostitute.” He said he had been motivated to come forward after learning that Khan planned to appeal against his conviction, and reading Khan’s defence in the trial, when he was trying to explain why he discussed pornography with his 15-year-old victim. Khan’s barrister said he had asked the boy what pornography he watched to find out where his “true sexual proclivities lay”, after the youngster told him he was confused about his sexuality. “When I read his defence, him saying he was just trying to help the boy come to terms with his sexuality, acting like his intention was to offer support and solace to him, I just thought: that’s the same pattern of behaviour he instigated with me,” said Andrew. “It could quite easily have been me. It would have been very easily me if I wasn’t surrounded by adults.” Lawyers for Khan said on Thursday afternoon that they had advised him not to comment on Andrew’s allegations, “bearing in mind the ongoing criminal proceedings against our client”. Half an hour later, he quit as an MP, saying he would now focus solely on clearing his name. helen.pidd@theguardian.com",News/UK news,Man accuses Imran Ahmad Khan of propositioning him when he was 16,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/15/man-accuses-imran-ahmad-khan-of-propositioning-him-when-he-was-16
