1/12/2022,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's cabinet has backed a plan to buy four fighter jets starting in the next fiscal year, an air force spokesman said on Wednesday, with a budget of 13.8 billion baht ($413.67 million) set aside for the procurement. The approval follows a recent expression of interest by the air force chief, Air Chief Marshal Napadej Dhupatemiya, in procuring eight F-35 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin Corp of the United States. The cabinet has agreed the budget for a four-year period starting in the 2023 fiscal year, to replace some of the country's aging F-16 jets, air force spokesman Air Vice Marshal Prapas Sornchaidee told reporters. Thailand's currently has 12 JAS-39 Gripen fighter jets made by Sweden's Saab and dozens of American F-16 and F-5 jets, some of which have been in operation since the late 1980s. Napadej last month expressed a preference for the stealthy, fifth-generation F-35 because its price had fallen since it first hit the market. The first F-35A cost $221 million in 2007 but as production quantities and know-how increased, the price fell https://reut.rs/33oKoR2 to about $79 million as of July last year as it gained appeal and buyers in more than a dozen countries. Spokesman Prapas said the type of aircraft to buy would be decided by two committees tasked with assessing the suitability of different aircraft.

1/12/2022,"MARATHON, Fla. (AP) — A segment of a 110-year-old Florida Keys bridge is reopening to pedestrians and bicyclists on Wednesday following a $44 million restoration project. Rehabilitation construction on the oft-photographed 2.2-mile (3.5-km) span of the Old Seven Mile Bridge began in late 2017. “What made the project challenging was that it is a historic bridge, and we had to restore the bridge to the same aesthetic fabric as the original,” said project manager Tony Sabbag, a Florida Department of Transportation contractor. Nicknamed “Old Seven,” the bridge was completed in 1912 as part of Henry Flagler’s Florida Keys Over-Sea Railroad that connected the Keys with each other and mainland Florida. The span is the gateway to historic Pigeon Key, a tiny island beneath it that once housed 400 railroad construction workers. In 1938, the railroad bridge was converted to carry automobiles. In 1982, the new Seven Mile Bridge, actually 6.79 miles (10.9 kilometers) long, debuted alongside the historic one, whose steel swing span that facilitated marine traffic between the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico was removed. The retired “Old Seven” became a popular recreation area and appeared in several films including “True Lies,” a 1994 action-comedy starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis. Wednesday’s late morning ribbon-cutting ceremony will be the crowning moment of a 30-year, $77 million agreement inked in 2013 between Monroe County, the City of Marathon and the Florida Department of Transportation. That agreement funded restoration and maintenance to preserve the iconic landmark listed on the National Register of Historic Places. “The Old Seven Mile Bridge is important to the Keys, the history of the Keys and a viaduct to get to Pigeon Key,” said Monroe County Administrator Roman Gastesi. Restoration included structural steel and bridge joint system repairs, new decking, pedestrian and bicycle handrails and other enhancements.",U.S./Associated Press,"Old Florida Keys bridge reopens to pedestrians, bicyclists",https://news.yahoo.com/old-florida-keys-bridge-reopens-060452836.html
1/12/2022,"Tennessee prosecutors plan to seek the death penalty against a man and woman charged with the gruesome torture, rape and murder of 36-year-old Jennifer Gail Paxton in 2019. Anderson County District Attorney Dave Clark notified the court on Monday that he plans to seek the death penalty against Sean Finnegan and Rebecca Dishman if they are convicted, according to WVLT. “Once a Notice of Intent to Seek Sentence of Death has been filed in a case, special procedures are initiated in the court case,” Clark said according to the station. “Among those is the appointment of a death penalty qualified attorney for each defendant and the right to a second attorney.” The pair are also charged with kidnapping, abuse of a corpse, tampering with evidence and exploitation of a child. Their trial is scheduled for later this year on March 4. Both have pled not guilty and have been held at the Anderson County Jail in Clinton, Tennessee since their arrest. In addition to being tortured, police said Paxton was denied food and medical care. Police found Paxton’s body in the home that Finnegan and Dishman shared in August of 2020. They said that the crimes that led to her death occurred sometime after December 23, 2019, according to the Oak Ridger. Police said the couple lured Paxton to their home by promising her a place to stay and paying her $100 to have sexual relations, but once she was inside, she became their prisoner and was not allowed to leave. Paxton was chained to a bed, shackled with a dog collar and her arms were bound with zip ties, according to warrants reviewed by the Oak Ridger. She was hit on the head with a baseball bat and arms to “incapacitate” her. “Once incapacitated, [Dishman and Finnegan] repeatedly raped the victim before finally using a ligature to strangle the victim and cause her to die,” Oak Ridge Police Department Sgt. A. Marvell Moore said in the warrants. He also said that, after strangling Paxton, the couple cut off a part of at least one of her breasts and nose and broke her bones and ligaments so that her body would fit inside a standup freezer. Moore said that, once Finnegan became aware of an investigation, he moved Paxton’s decomposing body out of the freezer and hid it under his bed.  He also said that Dishman admitted to using beach and a Swiffer to clean up the blood and other bodily fluids from around the house — including the living room, bedroom, and bathroom.  Clark said that one of the reasons he was seeking the death penalty was because the crime was “especially heinous, atrocious or cruel in that it involved torture or serious physical abuse beyond what was necessary to produce death.""
