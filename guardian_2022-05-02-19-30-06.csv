5/2/2022,"Rishi Sunak is being urged to issue a new generation of green bonds that would offer higher returns to investors if the UK government fails to hit its climate change targets. The Social Market Foundation (SMF) said its plan for sustainability-linked bonds would provide ministers with a greater incentive to meet carbon-reduction goals and would help boost the UK’s prospects of being a global financial hub for green finance. A report to be published on Tuesday by the thinktank calls on the chancellor to follow the example of Chile, the first country to peg the borrowing costs on its government debt to tackling global heating. Scott Corfe, the research director at the SMF, said: “Financial services will be key for delivering on net zero, and green finance could be one of Britain’s great economic success stories in the 2020s. Already, 200,000 financial services workers are in green jobs – a number that will undoubtedly grow over the coming years. “Government needs to work in partnership with the financial services industry to make Britain the leading hub of sustainability-linked finance. Leading by example, the chancellor should issue a new generation of sustainability-linked government bonds which would tie interest payments to the country’s net zero targets. Not only would this support green financial services but the prospect of financial penalties for missing net zero targets would strengthen the government’s commitment to decarbonisation.” Corfe said Sunak should start small in order to test investor interest but added the Chilean example suggested demand would be high. In March, Chile issued a $2bn (£1.6bn) sustainability-linked bond, which was four times oversubscribed. Returns to investors depend on the country adhering to its climate change pledges, including that it emits no more than 95 metric tons of carbon dioxide or equivalent by 2030, and renewables account for 60% of electricity production by 2032. If Chile misses a target, it incurs a financial penalty. Sunak is keen for London to be a centre for green finance and last year announced a programme under which the proceeds from green bonds would be used for environmental projects. The Treasury says two bond issues had already raised £16bn but it would need to be confident new forms of funding would result in strong, sustained demand and represent value for money to taxpayers. “The UK is a world leader in green finance and the chancellor set out a clear pathway at Cop26 for the UK to become the world’s first net zero-aligned financial centre,” a Treasury spokesman said. The SMF said issuing a sustainability-linked bond would show the government was “fully committed” to decarbonisation. The threat of financial penalties for overpromising and underdelivering could prove “a powerful way of holding government true to its word on net zero”. The interest rate, or coupon, on a standard government bond is set when it is auctioned to investors, with the interest rates on index-linked bonds adjusting in line with inflation.",News/Politics,Sunak urged to issue green bonds with higher returns if climate goals missed,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/02/sunak-green-bonds-higher-returns-climate-goals
5/2/2022,"The Manchester City, England and Team GB goalkeeper Karen Bardsley has announced that she will retire at the end of the season at the age of 37. Bardsley has played 82 times for England, going to seven major tournaments, and was an ever-present for Team GB at the London Oympics. “It was obviously a pretty tough decision for me to make, but after a lot of deliberation and unfortunately being away from the pitch for quite a while now due to injury, it just felt like it was the right moment,” Bardsley said. “As sad and strange as it is to be stepping away from something I’ve committed my entire young adult life to, ultimately it’s something I feel really proud of and I can honestly say, hand on heart, that I’ve left no stone unturned and I have no regrets about how I’ve applied myself and what I’ve achieved. “I feel incredibly proud of my career, but ultimately I’m really excited about the next steps and what is to come in the future, and I’m just very much looking forward to giving back to the football community in many other ways.” Bardsley, born in California to Mancunian parents, has been at City since 2013 and the club said they would honour her on Wednesday at their final home game of the season, against Birmingham City. Bardsley made her England debut in March 2005 and had been due to go to last year’s Olympics in Tokyo until injury forced her withdrawal. She helped England to finish as runners-up at Euro 2009 and was named in Fifa’s team of the tournament for the 2015 World Cup, at which England won bronze. Gavin Makel, Manchester City Women’s managing director, described Bardsley as “a real legend of the game” and the team’s head coach, Gareth Taylor, said: “Karen has left an undeniable mark on women’s football and I believe that her playing career is just the start of the overall impact she will make. Although injury has limited her appearances on the pitch during my time in charge, she has remained an integral member of our team and has made a real difference behind the scenes.”",Sport/Football,Karen Bardsley: Manchester City and England goalkeeper to retire,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/02/karen-bardsley-manchester-city-and-england-goalkeeper-to-retire
5/2/2022,"Gripping and exhaustive, Lars Edman and William Johansson’s documentary sheds light on the struggle for environmental justice in a globalised world. During the 1980s, Swedish mining corporation Boliden transported 20,000 tonnes of lead and arsenic-contaminated smelter sludge to Arica in Chile. With barely any effort to recycle and isolate the humongous amount of waste, toxic dust blew into residential houses and children played on the dumping ground. Generations of Chileans ended up with arsenic-related illnesses, including various forms of cancers and birth defects. A follow-up to Toxic Playground, Edman and Johansson’s first documentary on the subject, this engrossing second film chronicles the first court case between Boliden and the town’s citizens in 2018, in which nearly 800 Chileans made a claim of negligence against the mining giant – a trial that laid bare the inequalities between the global south and developed countries. The company argued that the Chilean health authority and a local company that had bought the sludge from Boliden were responsible for any health problems. With its team of experts, one of whom suggested that the high arsenic level found in Arica residents was from seafood consumption, Boliden went all out in its attempt to crush the lawsuit; in fact, the amount that the company spent on legal fees nearly equalled the financial compensation sought by Arica’s citizens. In contrast to the tactics utilised in the legal action, the kinship between Arica residents and the film-makers is especially moving. Over the course of her home town’s fight for justice, Jocelyn, a young girl has grown into a woman with a child named after the film-makers. To witness this evolution on-screen is astonishing. In spite of the legal obstacles, Arica residents courageously persevere through grief and loss with a dignified solidarity.

5/2/2022,"Niki Segnit keeps a sack of potatoes in her car. Or at least she did when she wrote The Flavour Thesaurus. She explains that, while her flat was pokey, her car boot was dark and larder-cool, and therefore ideal for storing both potatoes and onions. It is typical of Segnit to tell such a vivid story, impossible for the reader not to imagine her running out of her front door and on to the dark street, possibly in slippers, opening the boot and rummaging in a sack to get an apron full of potatoes for mash. Segnit’s story reminds me of mine: of being sent to get potatoes from the thick paper sack that was always somewhere shadowy, and of how sticking my arm into the black hole was a nauseating thrill. After all, potatoes are alive until you peel them. I feel rich and safe when we have a sack of potatoes. My old neighbour Vera believed they were best left unpeeled and boiled whole; that way, they don’t get waterlogged. If you need them peeled, that’s easily done once they are cool enough to handle. Or avoid peeling them altogether by simply pressing them through a potato ricer, which does the separating for you, and also gives you an aerated mash. Vera also believed in cooking too many potatoes, so you are set up for the next day, too. (Also that leftover bread should be broken into pieces, baked in a low oven until brittle, wrapped in a cloth and bashed to crumbs with a rolling pin. I am not very good at remembering to do this, so am glad the local bakery sells bags of crumbs.) You need both potatoes and crumbs for this week’s recipe, which is rather like a Neapolitan gattò – that is, mashed potato enriched with eggs, butter and grated cheese, then sandwiched around a filling and finished with breadcrumbs. While the Neapolitan filling is cheese (provola or scamorza) and salami, this version, from Italy’s instep, Basilicata, has a tender layer of cooked onion, tomato and, if you want, olives and/or capers, which perk things up. While this doesn’t need anything on the side, buttered peas or spring greens are always welcome, and if you want something more substantial, add some bacon or sausages, too, and a salad after. Don’t forget you are also set up for the next day and to keep leftover crumbs in the fridge or freezer, and potatoes in a dark place … or a car boot. Like gattò or lasagne, a short rest before serving is a good idea here. The flavours settle and the potato firms up a bit, meaning it can be served in what I think of as soft slices. Prep 15 minCook 1 hrServes 4 1.2kg potatoesSalt and black pepper50g butter1 egg yolk2 tbsp grated pecorino or parmesanMilk (but only if necessary)Olive oil2 onions, peeled and cut into half moons400g tomatoes, roughly choppedBlack olives or capers (optional)Fine breadcrumbsIn a large pan, cover the potatoes with cold water, add salt and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, cook until tender to the point of a knife, then drain and leave to cool a little. Pass the potatoes through a ricer or food mill into a large bowl (or peel and mash them in a large bowl), then add the butter, egg yolk, cheese and season – the consistency should be soft, rather than stiff. If it is stiff, add a little milk, but cautiously; it shouldn’t be sloppy. In a frying pan, fry the onion in olive oil until it starts to soften, then add the tomatoes and a pinch of salt, and cook, stirring, until everything is soft and tasty. Add the olives and capers, if you are using them. Butter a large ovenproof dish, then dust it with fine breadcrumbs. Press half the potato mixture into the base of the dish. Spread over the onion and tomato mixture. Cover with the rest of the potato, then top lightly with breadcrumbs.

5/2/2022,"In the summer of 2011, Eilís visited the Earthsong festival in Ireland, a small off-grid gathering with lots of singing and music. “There was no electricity, and we were all cooking on an open fire,” she remembers. “I spotted Sam a few times but didn’t speak to him.” Sam, who is originally from England but was living near Belfast at the time, had a free ticket to the festival. “I was friends with the woman who ran the cafe and she offered me a free ticket to work there,” he says. Although he was officially a member of festival staff, everyone else pitched in to help, too. “As soon as you arrive, you put your name on the volunteer list. I had offered to wash up in the cafe,” says Eilís. Although she thought Sam was “lovely”, she was too shy to talk to him. Other than exchanging pleasantries, they barely spoke during the festival. On the last day, she decided to take the plunge. “I wrote my name and number on a piece of paper as there were no electronics permitted. I didn’t even know where he was from – it could have been the other side of the world,” she says. Sam was surprised but flattered. “She went bright red and then ran off. I remember thinking she had a nice big smile. I thought she was courageous to do it.” He sent a text message the next day and asked for her email address. “We started sending each other long emails every day,” says Eilís. “I couldn’t believe how straightforward he was, so open and honest. He told me he wanted to settle down in a wooden house and have kids. It was really refreshing.” Two weeks later, they arranged a date: a hike in the Mourne mountains in Northern Ireland, near where Sam was living. “It was a three-hour trip from Kilkenny and I took my dog,” she says. “We had separate rooms in a hostel overnight.” She arrived to discover that Sam had planned a picnic lunch. He led her down to a large slab of rock overlooking a picturesque river. “I went to the toilet and when I came back, she’d disappeared,” he says. He soon discovered Eilís and her dog in the water below. “The dog had slid off the rock into the river and when I went to get him, it was too steep, and I fell in, too! It was absolutely baltic and Sam had to rescue both of us.” After changing into some dry camping gear, they went back to Sam’s house so she could shower. “I had a beautiful sheepskin rug and her dog pooed all over it,” says Sam. “It was a busy first date.” They met again over the next few weekends and soon became an official couple. In October 2011, Sam’s mum died unexpectedly and Eilís offered to fly back to England with him to see his family. “We’d known each other less than three months but it felt right,” he says. They moved in together in Kilkenny in 2012 and married the following year. Eilís is a youth worker, while Sam is a paramedic, and the couple have four children together. “I love that Sam has always been open to change,” says Eilís. “When he retrained as a paramedic, it was really hard because he was away in Dublin a lot of the time. He did it because he wants what’s best for his family. It’s what he always wanted and he gives 100%.” Sam admires his wife’s ability to keep her sense of humour, even when he loses his. “I’m the more grumpy one but we balance each other out. From the time I first met her, I loved how Eilís just takes life as it comes and makes the most of everything.” Want to share your story?

5/2/2022,"It’s 1989, and over the course of a blazing Wiltshire summer, a series of mysterious and increasingly complex crop circles appear in the county’s ripening wheat fields. Combining precise geometry and motifs from eastern spirituality and Celtic mythology, they’re soon attracting international attention from the media, UFO enthusiasts, dowsers, exorcists and tourists. Benjamin Myers’s latest novel, The Perfect Golden Circle, is every bit as idiosyncratic as its subject matter, combining lyricism with comedy and themes that range from warfare and environmental calamity to hope and healing. It centres on the creators of the crop circles, quintessential odd couple Redbone and Calvert. Like the characters in the author’s previous work, which spans historical fiction and rural noir, and includes the 2021 short story collection Male Tears, these men are outsiders. While Redbone lives in an old camper van, is immersed in the crust punk scene and prone to visions hallucinogenic and otherwise, Calvert is a solitary SAS veteran, battle scarred inwardly as well as outwardly from his service in the Falklands. Crop circles require meticulous planning. As well as weathering minor inconveniences such as hay fever and rain, the pair must also remain vigilant against interruption. As it turns out, these rural nights are buzzing not just with wildlife but with fly-tippers, confused nonagenarians, and sloshed lords of the manor. Bathed in moonlight, Myers’s land thrums with more ancient reverberations, too. There is, he writes, “an under-England, a chthonic place of hidden rivers and buried relics, of the bones of extinct animals and battle-slain bodies”. His main characters are acutely aware of it – their industry, it’s hinted, flows from it – and the humbling sense of perspective this confers is balm and inspiration. Their friendship makes a beguiling counterpoint to the novel’s more epic preoccupations. For their season finale, they’re planning something extra special: the Honeycomb Double Helix, “a web of wonder” that promises to be nearly three times as long as the Palace of Westminster is high. The novel’s title derives from a conversation between the men. As Redbone explains, there is no such thing as a truly perfect circle, it “can only ever exist as an idea”. Which means, he adds, “that we each carry one within us”. The notion neatly encapsulates the generosity of Myers’s magnetic novel, which brings together ingredients as diverse as folk song, Gaia theory and trauma, grounding them all in a memorable hymn to beauty.

5/2/2022,"A “highly enterprising” four-year-old boy was reunited with his parents unscathed after grabbing his mother’s keys and taking her car for an early-morning drive through the streets of Utrecht in the Netherlands, police have said. The boy, in pyjamas and bare feet, was spotted wandering on a street in the city’s Overvecht district early on Saturday morning by bystanders who called emergency services, the North Utrecht police force said on its Instagram account. After receiving a medical check-up and a cuddly bear from an ambulance crew, the toddler – with no immediate sign of any parents in the vicinity – was taken to the nearest police station and given a mug of hot chocolate, the post said. Soon afterwards, a police patrol reported that a car had been abandoned in the same neighbourhood, apparently after first colliding with two parked vehicles. A call to the registered owner of the car revealed it to be the boy’s mother. “She explained that her son was ‘highly enterprising’,” police said. “She spoke to the child on the phone, and we saw him imitate a collision and make a steering movement with his hands. This made us suspect he might have been driving.” Officers accompanied the mother and her son to the abandoned car, where they were joined by the boy’s father. “At the car, we asked the child if he could show us how it worked,” Utrecht police recounted in their Instagram post. “He opened the car, and put the key in the ignition. He started the car, moved his left foot to the clutch, and hit the accelerator.” They conluded that he had been “woken up early when his father left to go to work, and decided to go for a drive”. Fortunately, police said in their post – titled “New Max Verstappen discovered in Overvecht”, in a reference to the 2021 Belgian-Dutch Formula 1 world champion – “this mini boy-racer’s adventure ended with a fizzle”.",News/World news,Four-year-old ‘boy racer’ crashes car after early-morning drive through Dutch city,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/02/ffour-year-old-dutch-boy-racer-utrecht
5/2/2022,"Good morning. Ukrainian authorities are planning to evacuate more civilians from Mariupol today, after dozens were finally brought to safety following weeks trapped under heavy fire in the strategic port city’s Azovstal steel complex. The civilians had been sheltering in bunkers beneath the steelworks that is the last redoubt for Ukrainian forces in Mariupol. On Sunday, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said about 100 civilians evacuated from the steelworks would arrive in the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia on Monday morning. “For the first time, we had two days of a ceasefire on this territory, and we managed to take out more than 100 civilians – women, children,” Zelenskiy said in a nightly video address. He said he hoped evacuations would resume on Monday at 8am local time (5am GMT). The head of the Donetsk regional military administration later said the evacuation would begin at 7am (4am GMT). How many people are still trapped in Mariupol? As many as 100,000 people are believed to be in the blockaded city, which has endured some of the most terrible suffering of the Russian invasion. These include 1,000 civilians and 2,000 Ukrainian fighters thought to be sheltering underneath the Soviet-era steelworks. Will Biden’s Ukraine aid request be approved? Joe Biden’s $33bn request to Congress for more aid for Ukraine is likely to receive swift approval from lawmakers, a senior Republican said on Sunday, as the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, made a surprise visit to the war-riven country. What else is happening? Here’s what we know on day 68 of the invasion. The House committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol will decide “in the next week or two” whether to issue subpoenas trying to force Republican lawmakers to testify about Donald Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election, one of two Republicans on the panel said yesterday. “If that takes a subpoena, it takes a subpoena,” Adam Kinzinger said. The Illinois congressman also told CBS’s Face the Nation that public hearings planned for June would aim to “lay the whole story out in front of the American people … because ultimately, they have to be the judge” of Trump’s attempt to hold on to power. Kinzinger and nine other House Republicans voted to impeach Trump over the Capitol attack, which a bipartisan Senate committee linked to seven deaths. But Senate Republicans stayed loyal, acquitting Trump, and Kinzinger is one of four anti-Trump House Republicans who have since announced their retirements. He and Liz Cheney of Wyoming are the only Republicans on the January 6 committee. What did Kinzinger say? The June hearings will involve laying out “what led to January 6, the lies after the election, fundraising, the 187 minutes the president basically sat in the Oval Office [as the Capitol was attacked] … the response by [the Department of Defense],” he said. The Arkansas governor, Asa Hutchinson, is considering a run for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024 and would not be deterred if Donald Trump made an expected bid to return to the White House. “No, it won’t [deter me],” Hutchinson told CNN’s State of the Union yesterday. “I’ve made it clear. I think we ought to have a different direction in the future and so I’m not aligned with [Trump] on some of his endorsements, but also the direction he wants to take our country. On CNN, he was asked about an appearance last week at a “Politics & Eggs” event in New Hampshire, a traditional stop for any presidential hopeful in an early voting state. “You’ve got to get through course this year,” he said, “but that’s an option that’s on the table. And that’s one of the reasons I was in New Hampshire.” Is Trump allowed to run again? Yes, Trump is free to run – and has amassed huge campaign funding – after being acquitted in his second Senate impeachment trial, in which he was charged with inciting the deadly January 6 Capitol attack, in his attempt to overturn defeat by Joe Biden.

Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, has fallen victim to cutbacks at Netflix, as the struggling streaming giant has reportedly dropped plans for her animated series Pearl. Announced to fanfare last summer, the show was to follow the adventures of a 12-year-old girl inspired by historically influential female figures. The “revenge” political attack on Disney by Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, for opposing his “don’t say gay” law violates the party’s mantra of restrained government, his counterpart in Arkansas said. DeSantis and Asa Hutchinson could be rivals for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024.

Hot, dry winds will continue to spur flames burning through the drought-stricken landscapes in the south-west and the American plains, complicating efforts to extinguish roughly a dozen destructive wildfires that have already driven thousands from their homes. Risks are usually higher in the region during this time of year and fire conditions typically ramp up in the months sandwiched between winter and summer rain seasons. But experts say the explosive start is an indication of what’s to come in the warming months. The actor Olivia Wilde was discussing a forthcoming film on stage this week when she was served papers onstage. The envelope contained custody papers from her ex-fiance, Jason Sudeikis, with whom she has two kids. Wilde reportedly didn’t bat an eye after opening the papers, but the incident sparked questions. How did the person who served the papers get into the event at CinemaCon, a star-studded film industry gathering in Las Vegas? And why did the person choose such a public moment to hand the documents to Wilde? Last month, an Ohio court certified a class action lawsuit brought by lawyer Rob Bilott that would cover 7 million people – and at some point possibly everyone living in the US – who have been exposed to certain hazardous “forever chemicals” known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. The chemicals have been linked to cancer, birth defects, kidney disease and a range of other human health problems. They are called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down, persisting indefinitely in the environment.

5/2/2022,"AGL Energy, Australia’s biggest electricity generator, says it remains determined to pursue its plan to split despite a bid for a blocking stake by technology billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes. In a second tilt at the company in three months, Cannon-Brookes bought 11.28% of the AGL shares through his family’s Grok Ventures firm, making him the largest single shareholder. “We have purchased this substantial interest in the company because we fundamentally believe there can be a better future for AGL,” Cannon-Brookes said in a letter to AGL. “A future that delivers cheap, clean and reliable energy for customers. A future that accelerates the transition to net-zero, and a future that creates opportunities for AGL and value for its shareholders along the way,” he said. “We firmly believe the proposed demerger is a flawed plan that will fail to achieve these goals. As a result, we intend to vote every AGL share we control at the relevant time against the demerger, and will actively encourage all AGL shareholders to do the same,” Cannon-Brookes said. He also launched a website on Monday, called Keep it together Australia, aimed at recruiting other shareholders. Unlike the first round – when Cannon-Brookes teamed up with Canadian asset manager Brookfield – the renewed pitch went public via the media before AGL had received any share move. The 185-year-old company has been planning to demerge its electricity generation assets, most of which are coal-based, from its retailing arm – and access to almost 4m service accounts for electricity and gas. “The AGL board is committed to delivering the proposed demerger, which will ensure the value created through Australia’s energy transition stays with our shareholders,” an AGL spokesperson said, adding the split “is on track to be completed by the end of next month”. The renewed bid for AGL will probably become a talking in the election campaign. The February approach had included plans by the bidders to take AGL private and accelerate its schedule of closing its Bayswater power plant in NSW and the Loy Yang A power station in Victoria. The Liddell plant in NSW is on track to close by next April, and closed the first of its four units last month. The fresh move comes just days after the electricity market operator showed wholesale power prices had doubled from a year ago and were heading even higher. It also comes only hours after AGL announced what is effectively a profit downgrade of as much as $100m for this year’s profit, following a unit failure at the Loy Yang A power station. That may keep one unit offline until August.As reported in March, AGL did not think they had seen the last of the Atlassian co-founder, who has made renewables and climate change a regular feature of his public comments, including on Twitter. The first bid, raised after an initial rejection, was for a full takeover of AGL at $8.25 a share, valuing the company at about $8.5bn, including debt.AGL’s share price closed on Monday at $8.62, down 0.7% for the day, prior to news of a possible bid. Cannon-Brookes listed three reasons for opposing the demerger. The break-up would create “two weaker, interdependent entities that are more costly to run”, destroying shareholder value, he said. The Accel Energy part of AGL would also be a “significant risk of becoming a stranded asset given its meaningful coal exposure,” the letter said. It would “have substantial liabilities that impact its creditworthiness and impede its ability to raise the capital required to fund the replacement of its coal-fired power generation fleet and meet its remediation liabilities”. The third reason is that the company would be “globally irresponsible” in maintaining coal-fired power plants longer than necessary. “AGL is currently the single largest contributor to carbon emissions in Australia and the demerger will entrench a position that is inconsistent with limiting climate change,” Cannon-Brookes said. “Under the demerger proposal, AGL A [the retailing arm] will continue to source a majority of its energy from Accel Energy, which today generates electricity with 50% higher emissions intensity than the rest of the grid.” Cannon-Brookes has been building a range of businesses that could well benefit having access to AGL’s customers. These include plans for giant solar farms that could power the Northern Territory, but also supply Indonesia and Singapore via an undersea cable. AGL shareholders are soon to vote on that demerger plan. “It’s now or never,” is how one insider put it.",News/Business,Mike Cannon-Brookes buys up AGL shares in bid to block energy giant’s demerger,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/02/mike-cannon-brookes-buys-up-agl-shares-in-bid-to-block-energy-giants-demerger

The original CINCH was made out of some of the horse’s spare hair, and was talked about where Mexico meets the US, and, while it’s not unlike CLINCH or CLENCH, it came independently from the Spanish cincha. The subject of our next challenge is an alternative to CERT or CINCH. Far be it from me to suggest there’s a slight leap in the “Hence” in the Scottish National Dictionary … DODDLE, n. Also doadle. [′do(:)dəl, ′dǫdəl] […] 3. A small lump of home-made toffee sold in the “wee” shops in Edinburgh, usually four for a halfpenny; a super-doddle cost one farthing (Edb.3 1929; Edb. 1948 (per Abd.27)). Hence, used of something easy or attractive (Edb.5, Lnk.11 1940) or of “money easily obtained” (Gsw. 1934 E. Partridge Dict. of Slang (1937)).Edb. 1948 (per Abd.27):See yon car! It’s a doddle! Can ye no swim? Man, it’s a doddle. … for now, the question is: reader, how would you clue DODDLE? Thanks for your clues for HOPSCOTCH and for the memories (and notations!) the word prompted. There’s an inaugural winner of the nonaudacity award in Faiton77, who doubted the validity of “springs” as a deletion indicator in “Hope springs eternal at first to ruin game” and I enjoyed the way that the game lends itself apparently readily to such cryptic definitions as Smallboat01’s “Game of skipping stones?” The runners-up are Montano’s acrostic “Harmless old-fashioned playground sport chalked on the concrete, hard at first” and PeterMooreFuller’s deft “Bound to spoil children’s game”; the winner is Steveran’s sly “Game that’s drawn before it even starts?” Kludos to Steveran.

5/2/2022,"From 2013 to 2022, the title winner in Germany bears the same name. Bayern Munich are celebrating a 10th championship in a row. A decade of dominance is a novelty in the five strongest leagues in Europe. Such statistics are otherwise known in Europe only from clubs such as Skonto Riga, Dinamo Zagreb, Rosenborg or Dynamo Berlin from the East German Oberliga.Bayern are a club who win titles. In the past 50 years of the Bundesliga, they have ended up on top 30 times. They owe this to their unique identity: as the club of players. One successful generation takes over from another. And former players have been at the helm for a long time. The foundation was laid by Sepp Maier, Franz Beckenbauer and Gerd Müller, homegrown players and world-class footballers. They were a gift to the club and the football nation. From their team, which won the European Cup three times, the leadership of the following decades was recruited. At the end of the 70s, a footballer, Uli Hoeneß, took over responsibility for the club. He led it for more than 40 years, for a long time with his former teammates Beckenbauer and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. They combined an understanding of football with leadership qualities and helped the club to achieve an exceptional position in Germany. Since then, the club have relied on a principle that only it can afford in Germany. The best Germans or the best in the Bundesliga are identified and bought by Bayern. There they have to assert themselves among strong competition. A regular German player at Bayern practically automatically plays for the national team. In the early 80s they were called Rummenigge and Paul Breitner, in the late eighties Lothar Matthäus, Andreas Brehme and Klaus Augenthaler, from the mid-90s Oliver Kahn, Jürgen Klinsmann, Matthäus again and later Michael Ballack. If the players come from the city or the region, that unleashes a power, an additional identification with the club. This is how great teams are formed. From 2005, just like 40 years before, a team of homegrown players of world class grew up. Bastian Schweinsteiger, Thomas Müller and I gave a special touch to “mia san mia”: the attitude that the club always trusts itself with everything and everyone else always trusts it with everything. Today, Müller and Manuel Neuer guarantee titles with Robert Lewandowski. In 2020, the team repeated the treble of 2013. Bayern and Munich have everything that helps with success: a modern stadium, a great city, lots of fans. Actually, there are enough locations in Germany with similar potential. But Hamburg borrowed money from the fans and were relegated like Schalke, Frankfurt, Berlin and Köln. Dortmund almost went bankrupt two decades ago, hanging on the drip of Bayern Munich. And so the Bundesliga, the second most financially powerful league in the world, has been waiting since 1997 for someone other than Bayern to win a European Cup. On the one hand, this makes things comfortable for Bayern. Because the national competition is no match for the international competition, they benefit more than anyone else in Germany from the economic growth in top European football. Since 1998, they have increased their turnover more than sixfold. Hardly anyone else bids for the players they want. This huge advantage even allows for phases of weakness. On the other hand, danger now looms. From the late 1980s, when Italian industrialists cross-subsidised football as patrons, Serie A was the dominant league for a good decade. Matthäus, Brehme, Klinsmann, Rudi Völler and Thomas Häßler, the bulk of the German world champions of 1990, played in Italy in their best years. During this period, when hardly a final was played without Juventus and Milan, Bayern did not win the Champions League. Now we may be facing a decade of the Premier League, financed by very rich entrepreneurs from all over the world, but also states that want to improve their reputation with big sporting events. This year we may see the third English final in four years. Only the 2019-20 season, when the Champions League was played in a mini format and under complicated pandemic conditions, was the exception. This parallel to the Italian era could have consequences. In 2014, Lewandowski came to Bayern from Dortmund. Today, the best coaches in the world succumb to England’s pull and the most sought-after players in the Bundesliga no longer switch to Bayern as a matter of course. Erling Haaland will probably go to the Premier League, like Kai Havertz two years earlier, and there is speculation about Serge Gnabry leaving. If several of the outstanding talents of this generation see the greater appeal in the English league than in the German one, this will become a problem for Bayern and the Bundesliga. Bayern will not be able to count on support from Germany in this competition between leagues, and the weakness of the Bundesliga could also weaken the club in the long run. Perhaps this process is already under way. From 2010 to 2016, Bayern reached the semi-finals six times and the final three times in seven attempts. From 2017 to 2022 they made the last four twice in six attempts. This season they were eliminated before the semi-finals for the second time in a row, this time against outsiders Villarreal. This comes at a time when the old management generation is saying goodbye. For a long time, Hoeneß, for whom Bayern was a life’s work, led the club like an owner. Today, two former players are again at the helm, Hasan Salihamidzic and Kahn, Champions League winners from 2001. Their mandate is to strengthen the team now that everyone is crying out for investment and no one is talking about their own young talent – in a way that suits the club and the nation, with national and international stars who will make their home in Munich. Belonging at the top of Europe – that is the aspiration of Bayern Munich.  Philipp Lahm’s column appears regularly in the Guardian. It is produced in partnership with Oliver Fritsch at Zeit Online, the German online magazine, and is being published in several European countries.",Sport/Football,Premier League’s pull could spell trouble for Bayern Munich and Bundesliga,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/02/premier-league-pull-could-spell-trouble-for-bayern-munich-and-bundesliga
5/2/2022,"Chelsea had a real scrap on their hands at St Andrew’s as they edged past a resilient Birmingham. The hosts, fighting relegation, put in an admirable performance to disrupt the champions’ rhythm but a Pernille Harder penalty in the 71st minute gave Chelsea the three points as conditions worsened amid heavy rain. “Thank goodness, to be honest,” said a relieved Emma Hayes as her team retained the initiative in the title race. “I don’t think we should let it get to that point. However, let’s credit Birmingham. They were fighting for their lives; they fought for every ball. [They were] a real credit to their club and they made it extremely difficult.” With the championship and relegation to be decided, a dramatic final week of the FAWSL awaits. Will there be more twists and turns? SD “We want you to stay.” Those were the cries ringing around Meadow Park, directed at Vivianne Miedema, as she scored twice to lead Arsenal to a 7-0 dismantling of Aston Villa. The Dutch striker’s contract runs out this summer. Her supposed destination? Barcelona. Jonatan Giráldez’s team have been ripping it up in the Primera División, and are in the Champions League final after putting five goals past Wolfsburg in front of 91,648 at the Camp Nou in the semi-final first leg. Would Miedema slot into his team? Sunday’s double suggested as much; she was denied a hat-trick only by Sian Rogers’ outstanding goalkeeping. Although Jonas Eidevall mentioned incorporating “the Barça culture” in his post-match press conference, Arsenal’s manager may have to go to some lengths to persuade Miedema to reject the dream move. Perhaps snatching the title from Chelsea’s grasp in their last game could do the trick. MN  Match report: Arsenal 7-0 Aston Villa What a strike from Vivianne Miedema! She's scored two already! ⚽⚽Arsenal have made a strong start in this #WSL clash.Arsenal 2-0 Aston Villa📺💻📲 Watch on @BBCOne & @BBCiPlayer#BBCFootball #BBCWSL “Manchester United teams try to attack – they love attacking, they love scoring goals; this is a real spirit of a Manchester United team,” said Marc Skinner of his team’s offensive display against West Ham. Foot on the pedal from the first whistle, they bounced back in style from last week’s goalless disappointment against Aston Villa. With United afforded more space than they should have been, Katie Zelem was able to spray quarter-back-style passes around the pitch and the pace of Leah Galton and Ona Batlle down the flanks was integral. Their three goals came from Martha Thomas, an own goal and Galton but it could and should have been more. It was a high-quality performance to fill them with confidence before a crucial final-day showdown at Chelsea. SD Mollie Green (pictured) scored a 97th-minute long-range free-kick to complete a remarkable escape from relegation for Coventry United. The club were 10 points adrift of Championship safety after being deducted 10 points in early January as punishment for going into administration.  But Green's goal at Vicarage Road sent their opponents Watford down as Coventry finished one point above them. ""I hit it really sweetly and the rest is history,"" Green told BBC CWR. ""I'm speechless. I can't believe we've done it. We've put absolutely everything into it. We've got a massive belief and togetherness and it paid off today."" Coventry won four and drew four of their final eight league matches. Guardian sport Khadija ‘Bunny’ Shaw had a remarkable game against Brighton as she hit four goals in Manchester City’s 7-2 victory which maintained their top-three hopes. Jamaica international Shaw, who signed for City last summer, headed into the fixture with four Women’s Super League goals. But she was in a scoring frenzy on Saturday and had two within 12 minutes. The forward fired home two more goals in the second half, which led her teammate Chloe Kelly to question Shaw’s pre-match routine. “To get four is an unbelievable feeling,” Shaw told the club website. “That’s the objective, that’s what my team looks to me for: to score goals. Kelly asked me what I had for breakfast! It was the same thing I had for breakfast all year!” City sit a point behind third-placed Manchester United but with a crucial game in hand. Beat bottom-placed Birmingham on Wednesday and City will control their own destiny in the race for third place and Champions League qualification. SR 𝐒𝐡𝐚𝐰 𝐚𝐠𝐚𝐢𝐧?

The visitors have let third place slip in recent weeks, so perhaps it wasn’t all that surprising that they were unable to see off their opponents. But with Tottenham having 23 shots, including 10 on target, this game was shaped by their lack of finesse – a problem since their 3-0 defeat by Manchester United in January. Allowing Megan Finnigan to equalise in stoppage time was painful punishment. Wednesday’s north London derby could be an opportunity to make amends as well as do serious damage to Arsenal’s title hopes. MN Sign up to our free women’s football newsletter. Leicester held Reading to a 0-0 draw to secure a valuable point as they battle with Birmingham to avoid relegation. Birmingham’s win over Brighton last Saturday gave them renewed hope of staying up. But with Leicester claiming a point and Birmingham losing, the bottom club must win both their remaining games – at Manchester City on Wednesday and Villa on Sunday – to stand a chance of surviving. Leicester have only a visit to Tottenham left and could have done just enough to make sure their first year in the WSL cannot be their last.

5/2/2022,"Solitude is poor … Solitude is poor? Who can prove that? Just listen to the torrent of tears it brings forth and how they spread! Look at the countless marble-white hands that bridge its space in convulsions of pain; look at the torn veils of hope rocking back and forth, back and forth; look at the swarms of thought crowding into it with brute force, thrashing about mercilessly and ever faster … to get where? Dear God, to get where? Listen! Shut the door, huddle together, hold your breath – and listen! A deer runs through the forest. Through a green, airy, and lush forest, in search of something. The deer runs, trampling and crushing flowers underfoot. The leaves of trees rustle and murmur. Within the forest, an old tree’s imposing branches sway nearly imperceptibly. The deer has just stopped short. Has it arrived? It doesn’t know. It thinks it has. It darts ahead, side to side. Leaping and racing, it bounds ahead – and stops once more. Its eyes open wide. It stands motionless, trembling. What was that? A shot has just rung out through the forest. Faint sounds of something breaking, something crashing – and all coming toward it, coming toward it. Suddenly, the deer’s wide open eyes see something they have never seen before, and its ears hear something they had never heard before. The hushed forest fills with something the deer never knew before – and blood drains from its body. That was why it had to race through the green forest. Listen! Born in 1863 in Bukovina, Olha Kobylianska was a feminist writer who worked in various literary genres. Trilingual in German, Polish and Ukrainian, she wrote her early novellas in German. When she moved to Chernivtsi in 1891, to live in the house which has since become her memorial museum, she switched to writing in Ukrainian. She was influenced by the novelist George Sand and the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. This week’s poem is the last of a group of four prose poems by Kobylianska, with the collective title My Lilies. The poems, translated into English by the distinguished translator and scholar Olha Rudakevych, were published by Ukrainian Literature: A Journal of Translations, and are available to read online. While many prose poems lie flat and exquisite on the page, those of Olha Kobylianska stand up and address an audience. The sometimes surrealistic descriptive narrative absorbs the traditional craft of the storyteller, and grips her readers by well timed pauses and sudden rhetorical questions. The current poem begins with a question, which seems to respond to the opinion, voiced by someone “off stage”, that “solitude is poor”. Repeated, but with an added question mark, the imaginary statement is challenged, even mocked. That “poor” suggests “impoverished” rather than “pitiable” as demonstrated by Kobylianska heaping the landscape of solitude with metaphorical features – “the torrent of tears”, “marble-white hands that bridge its space in convulsions of pain”, “the torn veils of hope” and “swarms of thought”. This is a panic-stricken, chaotic solitude. Its images could be those of war. The hands are both dead (“marble-white”) and contortedly alive (“convulsed with pain”) as they struggle, disembodied, to “bridge” the space. The veils of hope behave like disturbed children, “rocking back and forth” and the thoughts are violent and undirected – not thought-like at all. The question asked about the thrashing “swarms of thought” – “to get where?” – forms its own bridge to the new story about the deer. The storyteller again commands attention, telling her audience to “shut the door, huddle together, hold your breath – and listen!” It may be that the audience itself is endangered, but given refuge by the story. Whatever magical action is beginning with the words, A deer runs through the forest, the audience cannot be sure that it will conclude with a “happily ever after”. While the imagined setting now is lush and green, the deer in its headlong flight resembles the thoughts in the opening lines. Nature looks on dispassionately. When the deer stops, it doesn’t know if it’s arrived. It’s always driven, and essentially powerless. The narrative constantly overturns the expectations of order and direction. The shot rings out, but the deer doesn’t immediately fall. It stands motionless, trembling, and we hear its question as if we’re now inside its head: “what was that?” Its eyes see and its ears hear things that may be revelatory, but are fragmented beyond the necessary mental processing. When the blood drains from the deer’s body it seems this is partly metaphorical: it signifies shock as well as death. The deer understands its actions in retrospect: it thought it was searching for something, but it was simply being pursued. The final comment, once again to “Listen” warns the audience the story isn’t finished for them. Although we never meet the hunter with the gun, this is a political parable about power and powerlessness. It’s a warning against trust, including trust in the power of stories.",Arts/Books,"Poem of the week: Solitude is poor … by Olha Kobylianska, translated by Olha Rudakevych",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/02/poem-of-the-week-solitude-is-poor-by-olha-kobylianska-translated-by-olha-rudakevych
