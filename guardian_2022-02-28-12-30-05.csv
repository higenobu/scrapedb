2/28/2022,"Queensland authorities estimate up to 15,000 properties could be affected by flood waters as the Brisbane River reached its likely peak on Monday morning, inundating low-lying areas in the city’s central business district. Heavy rain lasting more than three days unabated in Brisbane eased at midnight on Monday, removing some of the strain that had choked suburban floodways and dumped unprecedented volumes into dams. Eight people have now died in flood waters since last week and three are still missing. On Sunday afternoon a 59-year-old man was swept away while attempting to cross a flooded road on foot at Taigum, in Brisbane’s outer north. Police said witnesses had attempted to give the man CPR but he died at the scene. A man believed to be in his 50s is also presumed dead after his car was washed away in flood waters in the Currumbin Valley early on Monday. Police said they believe the man’s vehicle was driven about 30m along a flooded road. The vehicle has not been found. The Brisbane River peaked at 3.85m on Monday morning, still well below the 4.56m peak of the 2011 flood. An “unprecedented” volume of water, about 1,450 gigalites, entered Wivenhoe Dam in the past three days, taking its storage levels from under 60% to 183%. By contrast, in 2011, less water entered Wivenhoe in more than six days. Some parts of Brisbane have received about a year’s annual rainfall in just a few days. More than 1.5m of rain has been recorded at Mount Glorious this week. The average annual rainfall for the town, about 30km west of Brisbane, is about 1.6m. It is not yet known exactly how many homes were affected by flood water but what is known is that, in many places, the impacts were very different to 2011. Queensland’s premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, told reporters modelling had estimated as many as 15,000 houses affected. Brisbane’s lord mayor, Adrian Schrinner, told ABC radio the city council’s modelling for a 4m Brisbane River peak – higher than the observed peak on Monday morning – indicated that about 4,500 properties, including about 2,100 residential properties, would be flooded. An additional 10,800 properties would be partially flood-affected, according to the council’s modelling. On Monday suburban flooding caused by swollen creeks and Brisbane River tributaries largely subsided and people were able to return to their homes to assess the damage. But at the same time, the river peak caused inundation of low-lying banks, including the CBD, Southbank and West End. Extremely high tides are expected to continue, but abate gradually, for the rest of the week. There remains some concern that while heavy rainfall has finally eased, storms are forecast for later in the week which might cause further chaos if river levels remain high in the meantime. Diana Eadie from the Bureau of Meteorology said those storms posed an additional risk. “That really intense rain is now shifting into north-east New South Wales and is easing for much of south-east Queensland,” she said. “That being said, the risk for significant flooding is still very real. “We’re expecting more settled conditions today and continuing into tomorrow. From Wednesday onwards and the following five days, we see a return of the potential for severe thunderstorm activity with the risk of damaging winds, large hail and locally heavy falls. “We’re not expecting widespread rain as we have seen in this event, but with any severe thunderstorm, there is the potential that we could see very intense rainfall rates in some localised areas.” Palaszczuk said there had been “a huge response effort”. “It has been fast and it has been furious and it has had a big impact,” she said. “I don’t know about everyone else, but last night it was like cyclonic conditions outside. The winds, the rain and … we had two systems of thunderstorms merging last night as well during the course of the day. We didn’t know that was going to happen.” She added: “All these emergency services people have been on the frontline doing the best they possibly can. “If it wasn’t for them, there would have been a lot more loss of life. We should be thanking them for everything they have been doing. I want people to understand how much rainfall has come into these catchments and across the entire south-east.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, told reporters on Monday that in addition to the seven flood deaths, there were fears of additional fatalities after reports of people missing in flood waters at Yatala, Goodna and Esk. A man who fell from a vessel into Brisbane’s Breakfast Creek two days ago also remains missing. Social services groups are calling on governments to increase assistance payments for people affected by the floods. Aimee McVeigh, the chief executive of the Queensland Council of Social Services, said: “$1,000 per adult will not cut it, especially in the face of a record-breaking housing crisis … Queenslanders have experienced devastating flooding in the past 48 hours.” McVeigh added: “People in lower-lying areas are now facing the prospect of another brutal cleanup after another once-in-a-century flood. People in areas that have never experienced inundation are now reckoning with the fact that their homes are uninhabitable. “Our community organisations also need access to additional emergency relief funds now. They are on the ground sourcing emergency accommodation, providing food and supply packages and crucial mental health supports.”",News/Australia news,"Brisbane flood: warning up to 15,000 properties could be inundated as river reaches peak",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/28/brisbane-flood-2022-bne-river-peak-floods-update-property-flooding-warning-queensland
2/28/2022,"For Xu Guoqi, a Chinese historian, Beijing’s reluctance to denounce Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is alarming. “I’m a historian of the first world war. Europe sleep-walked into a huge conflict over 100 years ago, which also had had enormous consequences for China,” Xu said. “The world may be at the point of no return again”. But looking at how Chinese diplomats are responding to it, and how Chinese people have talked about it on social media in the past week, he said, “I’m afraid it seems we still have not learned the lessons of the past tragedies. As a historian I’m very disappointed.” On Saturday morning, five renowned Chinese historians – Xu included – wrote an open letter denouncing Russia’s action on its neighbour and calling for peace. The authors of the letter hope to persuade Beijing to make its stance clearer: that what Russia is doing is wrong, and China should say it out loud. “What will this war lead to? Will it lead to a large-scale world war?” the historians asked. “Great catastrophes in history often started with local conflicts. We strongly opposed Russia’s war against Ukraine. Russia’s invasion of a sovereign state by force … is a violation of the norms of international relations based on the United Nations charter and a breach of the existing international security system.” In public, China opposes any act that violates territorial integrity. China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, articulated this position again in a late-night post published on his ministry’s website on Friday. But over the course of the past week, as civilians were killed and western sanctions intensified, Beijing continued to echo Putin’s argument that Moscow’s action is a response to Nato’s eastward expansion. “Do they genuinely believe in that? Is it worth [it] for China to undermine its own credibility to defend the indefensible? I’m afraid they were fooled by Putin,” Xu said, emphasising that he and his colleagues wrote this letter because they love the country, and they do not wish a potential worldwide tragedy to stall China’s future. “This is simply a black and white matter,” he continued. “This is an invasion. As the Chinese saying goes: you cannot call a deer a horse. As Chinese historians, we do not wish to see China being dragged into something that will fundamentally harm the current world order. For the love of mankind, world peace and development, we should make this clear.” But Xu and his colleagues’ open letter was quickly taken down by internet censors after two hours and 40 minutes online. And, perhaps unsurprisingly, pro-war Chinese trolls denounced the authors – who are based in Nanjing, Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai – as “shameful” and “traitorous”. “Why did you not say anything during the west’s invasion in Iraq,” one quipped sarcastically. It is difficult to gauge the public opinion in China, but in the past few days, while Beijing’s diplomats struggle with a coherent argument, many Chinese nationalists expressed their admiration of Putin online. Some called the Russian leader “the greatest strategist of this century”. Others said China should leverage the current situation to “take Taiwan back”. But at the same time, censors are not taking down all anti-war posts, either. On WeChat, for example, many have also been discussing the situation in Ukraine. On Sunday, as Putin ordered his military to put Russia’s nuclear deterrence forces on high alert, some users posted a 1994 statement in which China urged all nuclear-weapon states not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against states that do not have them, including Ukraine. On social media, some of those who are against Russia’s action are also speaking out – although they are often met with pro-war trolls who accuse them of being “weak” and “naive”. “If Russia has issues with Nato, it should deal with Nato, why invade Ukraine?” one questioned in a WeChat video that attracted over half a million views in a span of hours. Nearly 9,000 users liked the video and more than 23,000 shared it. There is a long history of Chinese intellectuals speaking out, individually or collectively, on major domestic and international issues, including in ways that challenge official policies, said Prof Jeff Wasserstrom, a historian of modern China at the University of California, Irvine. “Sometimes the risks involved are small but at other points it is truly daring to engage in this time-honoured practice.” But Wasserstrom said the five prominent Chinese historians’ letter was particularly noticeable because of the tightening of the freedom of speech on Chinese campuses – both on the mainland and in Hong Kong - in recent years. Several high-profile Chinese academics have been barred from teaching. As the war intensifies, there are signs that Beijing may be changing its thinking. On Friday, China abstained at the end of the UN security council vote condemning the Russian aggression. Western diplomats saw this as a sign that Beijing is increasingly uneasy at being seen as defending Putin’s action, which has drawn worldwide condemnation. On Sunday, the Chinese envoy to Kyiv, Fan Xianrong, stressed in a video address that China respected Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. He also urged Ukraine-based Chinese nationals not to reveal their identity or display any signs of their nationality, reversing his embassy’s earlier advisory that encouraged citizens to stick the national flag on their cars. “Sooner or later, they’ll have to come to [their] senses,” Xu said. “The Chinese are very pragmatic. They need to understand they are a big beneficiary of the current world order, under which China also prospered. This is an opportunity for all of us to demonstrate we are a real responsible stakeholder.”",News/World news,‘They were fooled by Putin’: Chinese historians speak out against Russian invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/they-were-fooled-by-putin-chinese-historians-speak-out-against-russian-invasion
2/28/2022,"New Zealand now has one of the highest levels of Covid-19 transmission in the world, researchers have said – an extraordinary turnaround for a country that had managed to dampen the virus’s spread throughout much of the pandemic. Covid-19 modellers at Rako Science have calculated New Zealand’s effective reproduction number – or R value – to be 4.23, meaning the average infected person is passing Omicron on to more than four people. That gives New Zealand the highest R value of more than 180 countries by a high margin, with Myanmar recording the second-highest rate of spread at 2.98. The country is in the midst of an Omicron surge, with 334 people in hospital and 14,633 cases reported on Monday, including the environment minister, David Parker, who became the first MP to report testing positive for the virus since the pandemic began. In a tweet, he said he was isolating at home and had not been at parliament, nor with other MPs or staff, for a week. Epidemiologist Michael Baker said he was “not at all surprised” about the high R value at this point, partly because the rest of the world had already been through Omicron outbreaks. Another reason for the sudden increase in R value could be due to the introduction of rapid antigen testing (RAT) last week, which made testing faster and more convenient, he said. “More people have gone on to get tested, so we are seeing a huge spike in cases … It’s not that the iceberg’s any bigger, you’re just seeing more of it.” Baker cautioned against paying too much attention to a shifting R value rate, which can be distorted by changes to testing methods, in favour of closely watching hospitalisation rates. Those rates gave a better, and more consistent, idea of how the outbreak was progressing, he said. New Zealand’s first case of Covid-19 was detected two years ago on Monday. Baker said while it was “quite ironic that two years on, we are facing the most extreme transmission Covid-19 since the beginning the pandemic”, it was remarkable that New Zealand had achieved the lowest mortality in the OECD, by a huge margin. The country has reported 61 deaths in the pandemic. Meanwhile, the surge in community cases could compel the government to rethink its border settings, prime minister Jacinda Ardern indicated on Monday morning. There were nearly 30,000 cases over the weekend, compared with 47 at the border. The first of the five phases of the border reopening plan began on Monday, with vaccinated New Zealanders and other visa holders arriving from Australia able to skip managed isolation and self-isolate at home for seven days. Speaking to RNZ, Ardern said cabinet would discuss, and make decisions on Monday, about further changes to the border requirements. “We’ve been very much wanting to make sure that while we’re in this period of dealing with Omicron that we’re carefully easing up at the border so that we don’t necessarily overburden our health system,” Ardern said. “But with so many cases in New Zealand now, it makes sense to look at those settings.” Baker said there was no longer much public health justification for continuing controls at the border, because “people arriving from overseas will not contribute to the disease burden”. “We have almost got to the point now where people arriving in New Zealand have a lower prevalence of Omicron infection than people who live in New Zealand.”",News/World news,Previously virus-free New Zealand now has one of world’s highest Covid transmission rates,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/previously-virus-free-new-zealand-now-has-one-of-worlds-highest-covid-transmission-rates
