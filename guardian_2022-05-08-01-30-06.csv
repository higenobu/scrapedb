5/8/2022,"With 83 minutes gone, the public address announcer politely requested for supporters to stay off the pitch. Perhaps he had a premonition and, frankly, who was he kidding? Two minutes later Bristol Rovers had put a seventh goal past an already relegated Scunthorpe to miraculously leapfrog Northampton on goals scored and into the final automatic League Two promotion place. The Home fans emptied from the Thatchers terrace to mob the goalscorer, Elliot Anderson, who has been a revelation since joining on loan from Newcastle in January and was the hosts’ creator in chief on a simply unforgettable afternoon. At that point players and staff from both teams shot down the tunnel, with the Rovers manager, Joey Barton, among those asking fans to return to the stands. It was a fittingly barmy crescendo to a bonkers ride for those at a sold-out and rocking Memorial Stadium. Wael al-Qadi, the Rovers owner, ended up walking on to the pitch to plead with fans to keep their counsel for the remaining four minutes plus stoppage time before Barton took the unprecedented step of taking over the microphone to confirm the referee, Charles Breakspear, had threatened to abandon the game if supporters returned to the field a second time. “Please stay off the pitch,” Barton said in a message transmitted over the speakers, before both teams re-emerged about 15 minutes later. By then, news of Northampton’s 3-1 victory at Barrow had already filtered through to fans. At the start of the day fourth-placed Rovers, who were 17th in the division on New Year’s Day, were one of five teams down to Swindon Town in seventh hoping to secure third spot, although some fancied their chances more than others. At the outset they required a five-goal swing to go their way and their goals-scored column (71 to Northampton’s 60) was ultimately the decisive factor, while their head-to-head record was also superior. Barton had promised to go for the jugular and he stuck to his word, removing the stabilisers by playing two centre-backs, Connor Taylor and James Connolly, with wing-backs. Glenn Whelan, who turned 38 in January and played under Barton at Fleetwood, operated at the base of midfield to help police the odd Scunthorpe attack. James Belshaw was in effect playing rush goalkeeper for Rovers, who had lift-off on 18 minutes when the 18-year-old Oliver Lobley, on his league debut, inadvertently put Anderson’s troublesome cross past Scunthorpe’s 17-year-old goalkeeper Owen Foster, one of seven teenagers in the visitors’ lineup. Four minutes later Rovers had their second goal, Taylor heading in at the back post after more good work by Anderson. Taylor equally made a decisive intervention at the other end, preventing Cameron Wilson’s low cross from reaching Joe Nuttall inside the six-yard box. Within seconds Rovers were ready for the restart, ravenous for more. Luke Thomas pulled wide as the hosts pushed for a third, which would eventually arrive through Aaron Collins on 53 minutes. The Rovers striker potted his shot into the far corner and rushed to fish the ball out of the net. The goals kept flowing, even amid some agonising missed chances. Anthony Evans drove in on the hour mark and then scored a fine free-kick with 14 minutes of normal time to play. “We want 10,” was the message from supporters who could sense the extraordinary. Barton was playing the role of manager and balboy, desperately attempting to speed things up whenever and wherever possible. At that point they required two more goals and three minutes later Collins added his second, sweeping home inside the box to cue pandemonium in the stands. Goodnight Irene, Rovers’s anthem, echoed around all four sides of this ground but there was still time for one more significant goal, as Anderson headed in at the back post. Blue flares were lit on a bouncing home terrace. This preposterous finish will always be cherished in these parts.",Sport/Football,Bristol Rovers hit magnificent seven against Scunthorpe to clinch promotion,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/07/bristol-rovers-hit-magnificent-seven-against-scunthorpe-to-clinch-promotion
5/8/2022,"A scratch of the eyebrow. It wasn’t much, but it was enough. This, Todd Boehly, who on Friday signed a contract to buy Chelsea, seemed to be acknowledging, is what sport can do. His side had been leading 2-0. They had seemed comfortable. It had seemed that those vague worries about Arsenal and Tottenham catching up would disappear on the wind. But as Conor Coady headed an equaliser deep in injury time, the reality dawned: Chelsea, out of form and out of sorts, face a major fight to secure their place in the top four. Boehly’s purchase will go through so long as approval is granted by the Premier League and the UK government. The former should be a formality; the latter may be rather more complicated, if only for logistical reasons. Boehly was at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, sitting in a largely empty corporate box, although the chairman Bruce Buck joined him at half-time. Given the patchy nature of much of the football before half-time, a lack of confidence in both sides manifesting in a curious game that at times managed to be simultaneously half-paced and frantic, he quickly became the centre of attention. At every moment of action, the temptation was to look up to gauge his reaction. Like Roman Abramovich, whose sanctioning by the UK government forced the sale of the club, Boehly dresses down. Wearing sunglasses until the clouds came over midway through the second half, he was studiedly casual on Saturday, dressed in a long-sleeved T-shirt with sleeves pushed up to the elbows, one trainer-clad foot propped on the back of the seat in front of him. Then came a rite of passage. When Ruben Loftus-Cheek lashed the ball in from close range after 39 minutes, Boehly got to his feet to applaud, adding a whistle with the aid of his thumb and forefinger, a high-tariff technique that added to his air of alphadom; this, it seemed to say, was somebody who had been a successful college athlete. When, several minutes later, VAR finally concluded that Loftus-Cheek had been offside, the ball cannoning backwards off Antonio Rüdiger on to Romelu Lukaku’s knee before falling for the midfielder, Boehly looked baffled, spreading his arms in bewilderment before sitting down with a shake of the head and a muttered expletive. We’ve all been there. It was all very different from the blank-faced clapping that used to characterise the Chelsea owner. In a three-minute VAR delay Boehly had displayed more emotion than Abramovich had in 19 years. By the second half Boehly seemed reconciled to the idiosyncrasies of VAR, merely picking his teeth as a penalty was mystifyingly given by VAR for a tangle between Romain Saïss and Romelu Lukaku that seemed neither inside the box nor a foul. When the Belgian converted, Boehly punched the air. Lukaku’s second, swept in following a mistake from Coady, brought just blasé clapping. After a run of seven points from the previous six league games, the thought was that a scruffy win was just what was needed to get Chelsea back on track. Timo Werner, the world’s most luckless striker, had, after all, twice drawn decent low saves from José Sá. When he did finish neatly, he found himself penalised for a clip on Saïss’s heel in the buildup. Somewhere, there is an enormous cache of goals with his name on it. The Wolves manager Bruno Lage had described last week’s 3-0 defeat at home to Brighton as the “worst performance” of his time in charge. This was far better, and Saïss, Leander Dendoncker and Hwang Hee-chan all had chances even before Trincão’s remarkable 79th-minute strike. Only a fine save from Édouard Mendy denied him an 85th-minute equaliser. But just as it seemed Wolves would, slightly unfortunately, suffer an eighth defeat in 11 games, a late cross from the right brought Coady’s leveller It would clearly be an exaggeration to suggest that Chelsea need Champions League football but qualification will make everything more straightforward for Boehly, both in terms of budgets and the club’s capacity to attract players. Slowly, the clouds of sanctions are clearing and the club’s possible future is beginning to emerge, but only slowly, and the current dip in form is making everything more murky than it might otherwise have been.",Sport/Football,Conor Coady grabs last-gasp equaliser to complete Wolves’ comeback at Chelsea,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/07/chelsea-wolves-premier-league-match-report
5/8/2022,"As Roy Hodgson watched Watford’s inevitable demise with his hands planted firmly in his suit trousers, it all seemed most unfair. For the first time in his long and distinguished career, the former England manager has been relegated from the Premier League after a penalty from Wilfried Zaha – his 13th league goal of the campaign – secured Crystal Palace a 1-0 victory that could easily have been many more. A red card in the second half for the unfortunate Hassane Kamara after he had earlier given away the decisive spot kick compounded Watford’s misery on a day when they had needed everything to go their way and nothing did. But following his appointment in January with the club already mired deep in relegation trouble, Hodgson will know that – in truth – there was never much he could have done to save a team so lacking in quality throughout. Having received a CBE for services to football during the week, this was the 74-year-old’s second engagement at the Palace in only a few days and in much more familiar surroundings. Hodgson was afforded a rapturous reception from the home supporters who still no doubt very much appreciate the sterling work he accomplished during 162 matches in charge of his boyhood club. In his programme notes, the Palace co-chairman, Steve Parish, admitted his regret that Hodgson was not given “the send off he truly deserved” last year due to Covid restrictions. But having selected Eberechi Eze, Michael Olise and Zaha in the same starting line-up for the first time in the Premier League, Patrick Vieira clearly had no plans to be charitable to his predecessor. Palace’s win over Southampton last week revived their hopes of surpassing 50 points for the first time in the Premier League and they could have taken an early lead had Marc Guéhi’s header from a corner been on target, while Olise also fired over from inside the box. Despite making four changes from the gut-wrenching defeat to Burnley last week that virtually sealed their fate, it took Watford the best part of 20 minutes to even threaten their opponents’ penalty area. Not for the first time this season, their downfall was self-induced. Kamara misjudged his jump in an attempt to clear Eze’s cross to the back post and Olise’s header struck the Ivory Coast defender’s outstretched arm. Kamara claimed that he had been pushed but despite replays showing there had been slight contact, referee Graham Scott was vindicated after the incident was checked by VAR and Zaha made no mistake from the spot. A header from Samir that drifted wide of the post at least offered some hope for the travelling supporters, while Tom Cleverley needed treatment after almost connecting with another set piece but instead colliding with Emmanuel Dennis. Guéhi was the next to go down after his flying header was expertly saved by Ben Foster before Olise wasted a golden opportunity to make it 2-0 in first-half injury time when he blazed over from close range. Hodgson certainly seemed to sympathise with Kamara as the teams made their way down the tunnel, with Scott also explaining his decision to the Watford defender. Cleverley’s afternoon was over a few minutes into the second half after the former Manchester United midfielder limped off to be replaced by Ken Sema. Odsonne Édouard – making only his second league start since 12 February having fallen behind Jean-Philippe Mateta in the Palace pecking order – almost created a goal for himself after a mazy dribble but the Frenchman’s shot cannoned back off the post after going through Foster’s legs. Kamara’s dismissal after he was shown a second yellow card for pushing Olise to the ground made the task even more difficult for Watford, although – to their relief – Palace seemed to take their foot off the gas in the dying stages. Mateta almost scored with one of his first few touches after a teasing cross from Olise and Jeffrey Schlupp produced another outstanding save from Foster. But the victory means Palace move up to ninth spot while Watford must now lick their wounds and prepare for another season in the Championship.",Sport/Football,Watford and Hodgson relegated after Zaha gives Crystal Palace victory,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/07/crystal-palace-watford-premier-league-match-report
5/8/2022,"The call came around midnight. There was a suspicious man poking around a rundown complex of garages and workshops, police had heard a gunshot and so they wanted backup. The men of the Maidan group rolled out of the bodyshop that served as their headquarters, into a couple of vans with personalised Maidan numberplates and their own ambulance, and set off into the eerie quiet of curfew-hours Kyiv. The alarms this late were usually just for drunks so steeped in booze they had lost track of time and forgotten to go home, said “Sheriff”, who asked to go by his call sign. But the ad hoc group of paramilitaries, who work closely with a police force diminished by war – on call for the local stations and monitoring their radios – are always prepared for something more violent. Far from the frontlines, the war is straining society. There has been extraordinary solidarity across Ukraine, with ordinary people risking, and often giving, their lives to help others simply make it through the day, taking food and fuel to vulnerable and elderly people, or driving evacuation vehicles to pick up those stranded at the frontline. But a minority have taken advantage of the chaos of fighting, the flight of many neighbours into exile, and authorities distracted by an existential threat. There is constant fear of Russian agents, even far beyond the frontline. Security forces say they have arrested more than 4,000 “collaborators” and 140 people planning military sabotage since the war began. And cities are awash with guns, after the government started handing them out to almost anyone who promised to fight, during the early days of the war. “In Kyiv we are mostly seeing solidarity, but the dark side is more visible, too, now. When you have everyone cohesive, the little that is not sticks out,” Sheriff said. In over two months since the first missiles hit Kyiv, Maidan patrols have picked up opportunists on looting raids, desperate residents driven to steal as the economy collapsed, and Russian spies trying to scope potential targets, gather information or just prepare for orders to come. “We have to defend the whole country, the guys at the frontlines are the professionals, and we keep their backs,” said Sheriff, who said he tried to sign up for the military after the first bombs fell, but like many in the city was turned away from overwhelmed recruitment offices. “We want local people to see we are here, so there isn’t panic.” Four days earlier, they had picked up a Russian security service (FSB) agent using a fake Ukrainian passport, he said, because the man was acting like a bad spy from a B-list film, driving around slowly, taking photos of sensitive sites and then calling numbers in Russia. In a country filled with rumours and paranoia about saboteurs, it sounded like just another tall tale. But he flipped open his photo roll to show pictures of the man’s arrest, his fake Ukrainian passport, stamps in a concealed Russian passport showing multiple entries to parts of Ukraine controlled by Moscow-backed separatists, and even a picture of an FSB ID card, stored on the man’s phone. “At first I was sad they didn’t take me for the frontline but then I realised. It takes six months training in boot camp to fight, but it takes 18 years training to know how to catch insurgents,” said Sheriff, who spent nearly two decades in the police, finishing up as a colonel in the division fighting organised crime. “It gives you a feeling for people (acting suspiciously),” he added. People they catch, like the Russian agent, often underestimate the group because they aren’t in uniform. “He tried to threaten me that I was the criminal for stopping him. He thought I was just the usual territorial defence who just picked up a weapon. But I was in the police before, so I can eat him for breakfast (when it comes to the law).” The group was formed after the 2014 protests that ousted a pro-Russian president when he suspended plans to sign an association agreement with the European Union. They have been practising since then for a war that others never thought would come. “Everyone laughed at us ‘what the fuck are you doing, there isn’t going to be a war’.” They have their own telegram group with 20,000 subscribers so residents of their neighbourhood can reach out directly when they can’t get through to authorities. Some policemen from the area fled with their families in the first days of the war, and have not come back, the group said, making it harder to enforce order. And the new demographics of this largely working-class neighbourhood in eastern Kyiv, across the Dnieper River, have also made crime more of a risk. “Many of the people who left (when the war started) were people with money to get away, and the ability to manage. The people who stayed are the poorest, those with no work.” They include addicts and alcoholics, like the man found stumbling around the garages. He was obviously inebriated, and claimed his home was nearby and he had been drinking for hours and simply missed the curfew. The men called up a local, who confirmed the man’s wife would be waiting with a fury that would probably be more of a deterrent than any formal punishment, and sent him on his way. Sheriff’s second-in-command goes by “Kypish”, a word for intense action or combat, because he enjoys being part of the action. “My job is guarding a big shop because in the first day (of the war) it was all looted. It has electronic and construction materials,” he says. The problem is not restricted to the big city. Elsewhere, including the suburban town of Irpin, badly shelled then occupied by Russians and now infamous for atrocities, the invading troops were mocked for a rampage of theft. But in their wake, some Ukrainians took advantage of the abandoned houses. “At the beginning we were catching 10 a day, now they are very few in number. They are all local, now they are waiting for trial,” said policeman Andrei Suhdolsky. Cars that have been recovered are kept at the police station for owners to collect; for other items it can be hard to prove ownership. However, no one is under suspicion for taking food, he added, because during the occupation people were starving. Back in the empty streets of night-time Kyiv, where the curfew runs from 10pm to 5am, there are also teenagers who don’t want to be stuck at home, and some people who simply don’t care about the rules and wander out after curfew for fresh air. “There was a guy out, he said he wanted a walk. We made him do press-ups. One guy is maybe just a mistake, but if there are a lot of them, you have a problem. People here think curfew is just a joke the government made up.” After getting coffee at one of the few petrol stations that stays open all night for emergency workers, and wondering aloud why they hadn’t had more call outs, they ran into a problem that has been growing since February – hedgehogs. Not the anti-tank defences set up to stop invading forces, but the small prickly animals. They have taken advantage of the suddenly empty streets to roam more widely than they used to, forcing the animal-loving patrol car drivers to swerve wildly or slam on the brakes, if they want to avoid squashing the little curfew breakers.",News/World news,The Kyiv unit patrolling the streets as law and order cracks under war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/07/the-kyiv-unit-patrolling-the-streets-as-law-and-order-cracks-under-war
5/8/2022,"It can be said we have two ages: a fixed chronological age based on when we were born and a malleable biological age – the age at which our body is functioning, which can be affected by our lifestyle choices. Dr Morgan Levine designs tools that measure the latter. In her new book, True Age, she argues that we should regularly measure our own biological age – giving us information we could use to monitor, and even gain control over, our own individual ageing process. Levine, 37, is an assistant professor of pathology and epidemiology at Yale University’s school of medicine. This June she will join Altos Labs, a new $3bn (£2.2bn) anti-ageing biotech startup whose funders are said to include Jeff Bezos. What got you interested in the science of biological ageing?Growing up with an older father. He was 54 when I was born and people always assumed he was my grandfather. Most kids aren’t pondering their parents’ mortality early on, but I was already consumed with the fear that he might not be around. My mother, who works on ageing policy, also influenced me. I saw the resources it takes to care for older adults and wondered if there was a possibility to delay that need. Why is biological age important?It is more informative than chronological age for predicting risk of disease or death. That’s because it is not chronological time that drives the development of disease, but rather the biological changes taking place among the molecules and cells in our bodies. Most people’s biological age will be within plus or minus five years of their chronological age, but you can have outliers of up to 10 or more years. The wonderful thing, compared with chronological age, is that biological age is modifiable. We don’t yet know exactly how to modify it to the greatest extent, but the clock can be made to tick slower, or even possibly go backwards, in response to our behaviours (though it can also speed up). The first step is getting a valid and reliable measure of it, which my lab has been working on. You advocate getting our biological age measured regularly – once or twice a year. Is the science really advanced enough for that?It is early days for these tests, and they still need improvement. There is no standard, agreed upon way yet for measuring biological age – different methods give different numbers – and there’s probably no “perfect” way either, because there is nothing to compare against. But they are good enough to give people a general sense of their health status. Both my and others’ labs have shown these measures are better than just the standard cholesterol or glucose level tests that physicians currently use. Doing it regularly gives a more accurate picture: people can put too much weight on a single measurement and things like being sick or uncharacteristically stressed can misconstrue it. There are various consumer tests available. How might we best measure?Right now, probably the cheapest and easiest way is based on regular clinical lab tests that people would get done as part of an annual physical. I have published a method of estimating biological age that combines nine blood measures and the calculator to do it is free online. But there are other ways too. Counting the diseases and/or high-risk conditions a person has and adding this up into a single score is one method, though it is much less predictive for younger people. Molecular-level methods include the measurement of telomere length [the protective sections of DNA at the end of our chromosomes which shorten with age], though I don’t think it is such a powerful predictor. Another, which my lab has worked on, is epigenetic clocks. These use machine learning to decode some of the patterns of DNA methylation – chemical tags on our DNA throughout our genome that can alter quite dramatically with ageing. Results from our epigenetic measure match with the clinical test because we trained the former on the latter. You have a vested interest here. You helped develop “Index”, a $499 epigenetic age test which uses a saliva sample and is offered by Elysium Health…Elysium Health did license [my lab’s] epigenetic measure. I decided to work with them because I wanted to make sure what they provided to consumers was the most valid and reliable version possible. I stopped work with the company last year and I am not receiving any compensation from them (though it was too late to correct for this book). I’ve never received a dime for the clinical test, which is freely available and I promote equally to the epigenetic test. Your own biological age is five years younger than your chronological age. But it might not feel so great to discover you are older biologically. Do you understand why people might not want to know?Completely. It is a personal choice. For me it is just a way to start evaluating things; a potential early wake-up call that could lead to behaviour change. And, because it is potentially modifiable, it is less worrisome than a genetic test, where these are the cards you’re dealt at birth. Is it just the usual lifestyle factors we all know about but find so hard to implement that can alter biological age?The patterns we observe are nothing surprising. People who tend to age slower don’t smoke, don’t really drink, exercise regularly, eat lots of plants, get better sleep, and experience less stress. On average, only 10-30% of our lifespan is estimated to be due to genetics. That means how we age will largely be down to our behaviours – along with some random chance. Something we don’t have control over which has a huge impact is socioeconomic status. Being poor reduces your life expectancy by about 10 years on average, which is on a par with being a current smoker. We think it is chronic stress to some degree. Caloric restriction (CR) is popular in the tech world as a way of increasing longevity. What evidence is there it works in humans to slow ageing?The Calerie study [Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy] is really the only randomised clinical trial. Some of the biological age estimates I have created have been applied and they do seem to show some impact from CR, though whether it is down to the restriction of calories or just the lack of overeating, we don’t know. There is also a question about whether the benefit would be maintained over the long term. Obviously, CR should be at a level where you’re still getting adequate calories. In the Calerie study it was only a 12% reduction. I am not a proponent of CR for most people – there are better ways – but there are probably less health risks with moderate CR versus what is more common, which is overeating. You and your husband – who also studies ageing – are leaving your current positions at Yale to join Altos Labs, which is focused on turning back the ageing clock through cellular reprogramming. What will you be doing?One goal is developing biological age measures to a level that they could be a surrogate end point in clinical trials to slow or reverse ageing (using lifespan or disease incidence isn’t really feasible because results can take decades). I’ll also continue to study epigenetic clocks. They are a bit of a black box. We can estimate ageing epigenetically, but we don’t really understand what is going on. The mega-rich have a penchant for funding anti-ageing research and Altos Labs seems no exception. Isn’t this just an effort to extend the lives of plutocrats?That’s not why I joined [Altos Labs]. I would actually have a big problem working on anything that increased health disparities. I joined because I want to keep the majority healthier for longer. Scientists involved in ageing research need to make the case that our involvement is for the greater good. Wouldn’t anti-ageing research funding be better spent on combating diseases such as cancer, heart disease and so on, which we know are killers?We look at diseases in a very siloed way, and our medical system goes after one at a time. But the process – biological ageing – that gives rise to cancer is the same one that gives rise to diabetes, Alzheimer’s, heart disease and others. If we can tackle the thing that causes all of them simultaneously, it could deliver a bigger benefit. You would be saving people from, or at least postponing their incidence of, not just one but many major chronic diseases. At what point does an obsession with staying young and healthy become negative? Shouldn’t wisdom, wrinkles and grey hair be celebrated rather than fought and derided?I struggle with this. I don’t want to stigmatise ageing. For most people wrinkles and grey hair don’t have a huge effect on quality of life. Delaying biological ageing is about preventing or slowing the accumulation of diseases, which do affect quality of life. A lot of people in the field want to call ageing a disease. I disagree. Not only does it further stigmatise ageing, but I don’t think we could settle on a chronological or even biological age where you could say: you are diseased now, and you weren’t diseased before. Is there such a thing as too much exercise?If you bottled the effect of exercise and sold it as a pill, it would be one of the best anti-ageing interventions on the market. And it is never too late! But, yes, there is probably a sweet spot for optimal benefits. Past a certain point and there seem to be diminishing returns. It is difficult to know the optimal level and type of exercise for each of us, but likely most of us aren’t even getting close to it. What do you do to lower your own biological age?I try to eat a mostly plant-based diet, stay active and exercise. Sleep and stress levels are the areas where I know I need to pay more attention. I do intermittent fasting where I restrict the time window in which I eat. I don’t know if it is CR – I don’t really count my calories – but implementing it isn’t hard. I always calculate my biological age based on my clinical numbers from my annual physical and I’m due another epigenetic test. But I’m no biohacker: I leave my experimenting to the lab. Any advice for those who want to go further with biohacking their ageing process to quantify the specific effect of their regimes?I would caution those interested in self-experimentation not to put too much faith in every single metric. While hypothetically in the future we could have these applications, we aren’t there yet. If anything, I think this kind of testing might dissuade people from unproven interventions: most of the regimes people might test I doubt will show a sustained effect on biological age.

5/8/2022,"Doctor Who: Redacted BBC SoundsAccess All BBC SoundsWill Be Wild Pineapple Street Studios for Wondery and Amazon Music I’m far from a hands-aloft Whovian and had vaguely assumed that the new podcast Doctor Who: Redacted was one of those spin-off-from-the-telly-show affairs, where enthusiasts discuss the latest episode of a successful TV series. But no! Redacted, now on its fourth episode, is a fun, engaging drama series that features the current Doctor – we hear her leave a distressed message right at the start – plus other familiar Who characters. Crucially, however, it doesn’t plonk them centre stage. Instead, our lead characters are Cleo, Abby and Shawna, uni-dropout pals and hosts of a investigative mystery podcast called “The Blue Box Files”, which explores the many sightings of a strange old police box during unusual events in history. The action concentrates mostly on Cleo, a young trans woman, played by the funny, charismatic Charlie Craggs: “Oh, come on, I don’t know nothing! I’m just here for the sass!” she announces when asked to interview a journalist. But Cleo quickly becomes the person with most insight into what is happening, which is, thus far, the disappearance of anything and anyone to do with Doctor Who. Nobody seems to remember ever seeing the Doctor, and people associated with her (or him, in the old days) keep disappearing. A news report says that a lad called Ryan Sinclair and his grandpa have gone missing (previous Doctor travelling chums); soon after, everyone forgets them completely. Written by YA novelist Juno Dawson and directed by audio fiction queen Ella Watts, the action in Redacted lickety-splits along, driven by lively performances and excellent sound design. Plus, it’s such fun! Like all the best Doctor Who TV episodes, there’s a psychological element, some jokey lines and, crucially, out-there Who-esque action. By episode two, Cleo and her brother Jordan find themselves witnessing what appears to be a live hologram of Who character Rani Chandra being attacked by an “all humans must die” monster. A few minutes later they turn round to see that an entire hotel has vanished. This is excellently entertaining stuff (I prefer Redacted to the current Doctor Who TV series), ideal for family journeys. And there aren’t many shows you can say that about. Another upbeat new show is a rejig of the BBC’s podcast about disability, Ouch!. Now called Access All, it’s hosted by Nikki Fox, with reporter Emma Tracey. Fox uses a wheelchair, Tracey is blind and their journalism has humour and insight into the difficulties and triumphs of their interviewees. The opening episode was great: informative and moving. It featured a sweet enough interview with Bake Off semi-finalist Briony May Williams and a more interesting chat with Dale, a gym instructor who’s decided to specifically cater for people with disabilities. He described teaching tennis to schoolchildren and realising that a girl in a wheelchair, who was always given the referee’s job, could play just as well as the other kids: “She wasn’t disabled by her disability; she wasn’t able to take part because she never had any support.” Also, vitally, we heard from two people who explained how rising energy costs are wrecking their ability to look after their disabled children. One father, Dan, got understandably upset. His daughter, Emily, needs various bits of heavy equipment, including a ventilator, to be plugged in and running for hours a day. Because of the jump in electricity prices, he has had to switch off Emily’s hoist and is carrying her between bed, shower and wheelchair. I thought of Dan when I heard Nick Robinson interview the Tory minister George Eustice on Today on Wednesday. Cutting down on household expenses isn’t just about deciding to opt into Tesco’s Value range – as though people aren’t buying that already – it’s about making decisions like this. Hoist or ventilator? Heating or eating? Dan blows the hairdryer on Emily’s feet every night before he puts her socks on, because he can’t afford to heat the house. If you’d like to ramp up your incredulous rage even more, then try Will Be Wild, another great investigation by Pineapple Street Studios for Wondery and Amazon Music (the combo that brought us the excellent 9/12). The podcast uses the 6 January 2021 invasion of the US Capitol building as its kick-off, analysing not simply why such an utterly shocking event happened, but how it was allowed to. The information it uncovers is indeed wild. An interviewee informs us that he and others warned the Department of Homeland Security that such an event was likely to occur… and nothing happened.

5/8/2022,"There is a school of thought that says central banks, after a decade of running scared, have found their mojo again. Their anxiety stemmed from the 2008 crash, when banks panicked in the wake of the US sub-prime property crash and drained the financial system of funds. Only the central banks could make up the difference – with a lending programme known as quantitative easing – and it has been the same story ever since. Each time central banks attempted to reinvent the old order, hinting that interest rates might inch back towards 2% or even the old normal of 4% to 5%, investors took fright, forcing a U-turn. On several occasions, including at the start of the pandemic, even more publicly insured money was injected into financial markets to preserve the bedrock of the capitalist system. It became almost a joke in the Square Mile that when financial markets wobbled, Bank of England officials would print more cash, offering it at almost zero interest rates, in the hope it calmed the fevered brows of City traders. An inflation rate that is heading to 10% or more has left central banks with “no choice”, in the words of former Bank of England official Adam Posen, but to show some guts and push rates higher, even if it means, in the midst of the Ukraine war, triggering a recession. Once, central banks worried about the collateral damage from higher borrowing costs, and not just the impact on investors forced to acknowledge that the value of their shareholdings depended on central bank support. They worried about small businesses that might be pushed into bankruptcy and mortgage payers forced to hand back the keys to their homes. Not any more, according to those who support central banks taking a harder line. The first thing to say to those who believe central banks have rediscovered their confidence is that they are diverging widely in their response to the current crisis. In the US, where the government love-bombed households with cash during the pandemic, most of which has been spent on imports almost as much as domestic goods and services, the central bank has been given licence by financial markets to withdraw some of its cheap money. Now it is on course to push rates much higher. Meanwhile, Japan is in the opposite corner. The Bank of Japan has promised financial markets it will maintain the peace and tranquility enjoyed since the world’s third-largest economy suffered its own property collapse in 1989. To this end, Tokyo will keep borrowing costs below zero for the foreseeable future. In fact, it is almost impossible to envisage an economic trigger that would cause Tokyo to push interest rates upwards. Over at the European Central Bank, Frankfurt’s finest are coping with a soaring inflation rate, but unlike the US Federal Reserve, almost all the pressure comes from the energy sector and the Ukraine war, not households flush with government cash. ECB officials have made noises about a possible increase in interest rates to calm prices, though inflation is expected to tumble next year without any action, so any rise now would probably need to be reversed in 2023. The Bank of England occupies a special and confused position, oscillating from one extreme to the other. For the past six months a majority on Threadneedle Street’s monetary policy committee has talked as if the American and British economies were in the same boat. They argued there was too much money chasing too few goods, wages were about to spiral in response to a shortage of workers, and inflation was about to jump, possibly for many years, on the back of this impetus. Except Britain turned out to be more like the EU. Inflation is going to jump, yes. But there is little pressure from wages because 40 years of draconian employment laws have stripped workers of bargaining power. Much of the increase in earnings reflected in official statistics comes from the stellar wage increases demanded in discrete corners of the labour market – by IT professionals, corporate lawyers, accountants and our old friends, the City traders. UK inflation is almost exclusively the result of higher fuel and energy bills, coupled with an increase in food costs due to supermarkets jacking up prices to recover margins squeezed by competition over the last decade. Bank governor Andrew Bailey, for so long the harbinger of higher interest rates, now sings a different song, even after his rate-setters last week increased the base interest rate for a fourth time to 1% and signalled a few more rises to come. Britain was about to enter a “very difficult period” of low growth and high inflation that could bring with it higher unemployment, he said. Fear stalks the central bank again. It means interest rates are likely to be capped at 1.5% and might not increase beyond 1%. Cuts next year are possible.",News/Business,Confidence?

5/8/2022,"Cyndi Lauper is about to get the feature-length documentary treatment, with news that a film about the singer’s life is in production. It will be called Let the Canary Sing and is directed by Alison Ellwood. Ellwood made the award-winning The Go-Go’s in 2020, which told the story of the LA rock band’s rise to the top and subsequent implosion. From the documentary about Janet Jackson earlier this year, to Sheryl, out in the US this weekend, about the long career of Sheryl Crow, more and more films are focusing on women’s careers in music and finally taking it seriously. Many stories written upon the release of Sheryl have followed a similar vein, in that, despite her huge success, she was never given the credit she was due. In an interview with Crow, in the New York Times, younger artists – from Soccer Mommy to Best Coast – said how much she meant to them. On YouTube, you can watch Waxahatchee and Snail Mail respectfully and beautifully covering Strong Enough, a Crow hit from 1993. If the credit has always been there, the new film is putting it in its rightful place. Certainly, music history has always been askew about recognising its female contributors. In 2020, NPR reported that women made up only 8% of inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (bizarrely, Crow has never been nominated), though this year Pat Benatar, Carly Simon and Dolly Parton joined the club, despite Parton’s initial resistance. These documentaries stand as correctives to stories that were often told badly at the time. Bad Reputation, the 2018 film about Joan Jett, portrays a music press that hated the Runaways, which thought they were cute until they decided they were “sluts”. This might have been the 1970s, but when I started reading music mags in the 90s, “women in rock” special issues were standard and lists portioned off female musicians as something separate and alien. In 2003, NME put Avril Lavigne on a cover with the line “All hail the heroines of the no-cock revolution!” Different times. There is a movement towards documentaries that explore pop culture from the past in the context of today’s more considered attitudes. Many shine a light on tabloid culture and its treatment of celebrities, from Jade Goody to Paul Gascoigne. So music, too, is getting its revision. As the gatekeepers change, the record is being corrected, at last. This year’s MasterChef came to an end with a final that summed up the eccentricities of what has been a brilliant competition, up there with the best. Radha Kaushal-Bolland, who is 23, had only been cooking for a couple of years and made John Torode cry, served an entirely vegetarian meal. Pookie Tredell served cocktails from a flower and has dished up rice in every colour of the rainbow, as well as a meal in the colours of the Irish flag. It felt like a playful year, in which the competition was hungry for difference, whether that was in celebrating rough-and-ready home cooks or wannabe Heston Blumenthals. But in the end, I am not sure the competition was even that close. Eddie Scott, the former Marine pilot who at one point wore a pink shirt and bow tie in homage to his hero, Keith Floyd, won with his combinations of classic French cuisine and Indian spices. His final menu reminded me of MasterChef in its early days, with a focus on technical skill as well as flavour. But that was a stuffier show then and Scott and the rest of the finalists, proved that these days MasterChef is very far from stuffy. One night last week, I was flicking through the channels and settled on the last 15 minutes or so of the Arsenal v Spurs match on BBC Two. At the weekend, I had ended up watching Arsenal trounce Aston Villa. They weren’t matches I had planned to see, but had chanced upon and stuck with. Isn’t this amazing, I said, as Caitlin Foord scored twice in 11 minutes. (Spurs were obviously feeling emotional that night.) Women’s football is on TV and it is completely normal. It’s a far cry from even a couple years ago when, to watch a number of women’s football matches without being there, you had to track them down online and then hope they had more than one camera trained on the pitch. But times have changed, quickly and definitively. According to new research by the Women’s Sport Trust, more people are watching women’s sport than ever, and they are watching it for longer. “These encouraging figures support our longstanding view that if women’s sport is made visible, then audiences will watch,” said Tammy Parlour, co-founder and CEO of the trust. People are watching women play football, cricket and rugby. The rise in audience figures is huge. During the first quarter of last year, 6.7 million watched women’s sport; in the same period this year, that stood at 17.9 million. The fact that it is now possible to accidentally catch a match one afternoon or evening feels momentous and I have already started to take it for granted that women’s sport is on mainstream TV. If these figures are anything to go by, and the right people are listening, there should be plenty more where that came from.

5/8/2022,"After working so hard to put survival back in their own hands, Burnley succumbed to Aston Villa. The optimism garnered from Mike Jackson’s first four games in temporary charge evaporated at Turf Moor thanks to goals from Danny Ings, Emi Buendía and Ollie Watkins to leave the hosts looking over their shoulder with great concern. Jackson will face a challenge to lift his players after such a dispiriting loss. His only fit strikers have two goals between them in the Premier League this season and his first-choice centre-back pairing are both injured going into their final three games. With Leeds and Everton playing on Sunday, Burnley could be back in the relegation zone by the end of the weekend. Steven Gerrard, on the other hand, will be happy that his side are safe, barring a miracle in the next fortnight. Burnley were given a warning of Ings’ ability to run in behind in the third minute when he got beyond the defence to latch onto a long pass over the top, only to curl his shot wide. There was no mistake at the second time of asking when Buendía saw the former Burnley striker find space and measured his pass perfectly for Ings to run on to and calmly slot the ball into the corner from 12 yards. There was a muted celebration from Ings on his return to Turf Moor where he spent four years earlier in his career. Despite going a goal behind, an almost full Turf Moor were vocal in support of a team that had earned 10 points since Sean Dyche’s departure. A reinvigorated Dwight McNeil was the main cause of concern for Aston Villa. The winger showed speed and skill on the right on numerous occasions but could not find the perfect final ball for Wout Weghorst or Ashley Barnes to attack. Burnley were punished for their attacking flaws when an overlapping Lucas Digne, making the most of McNeil forgetting about his defensive duties, collected a Watkins pass on the overlap, before cutting the ball straight to Buendía who sidefooted his shot towards goal before watching it defeat Nick Pope thanks to a James Tarkowski deflection. Ezri Konsa and Weghorst grappled and ended up on the floor on the right touchline. The Aston Villa defender was first to his feet but forgot about his surroundings and McNeil nipped in to collect the ball and drive for goal, only to hit a weak shot straight at Emi Martínez, who spent the entire game wasting time, much to the home supporters’ chagrin. Already missing captain Ben Mee, Burnley suffered a further blow when Tarkowski sunk to the turf and was forced off early in the second half. The skipper for the day was replaced by Kevin Long, for only his third appearance of the season. It did not take long for Villa to capitalise on Long’s introduction. John McGinn found space on the left and flashed a dangerous cross into the box for Watkins who had found space between the unfortunate Long and Charlie Taylor, allowing him to head through Pope’s legs from close range and end the game as a contest. At three goals down with 18 minutes to go, left-back Erik Pieters was brought on to replace the ineffective Barnes, starting his first game since September, a sign of the limited squad depth available to Jackson. The caretaker must have looked over aghast when Gerrard brought on Philippe Coutinho for the final 10 minutes, which included a Maxwel Cornet consolation. Jackson will be hoping for key players to quickly return to fitness, otherwise Burnley’s Premier League stay could be at an end.

5/8/2022,"On the brink of its May 9 Victory Day celebrations, Russia looks very far from triumph in its war in Ukraine. And all of its options going forward are fraught with danger. After a disastrous assault on Kyiv, Russia is engaged in an attempt to take territory in Ukraine’s east, as its military nears exhaustion and sanctions continue to escalate. “With the current force that they have, the push that they’re attempting now is all that they have left,” said Jeffrey Edmonds, former director for Russia on the US national security council and senior analyst at the CNA thinktank. “Militaries just don’t recover that quickly from such a devastating loss. And given how effective the Ukrainians have been with our support, I just don’t think they’re going to be able to achieve their objectives within the coming weeks. And the coming weeks are going to be the telltale of where this is going.” Facing setbacks, officials have suggested that Vladimir Putin may use the May 9 holiday to repackage the war in Ukraine. Dramatic options include escalation through a formal declaration of war or general mobilisation – or de-escalating by proclaiming victory. Alternatively, Putin could offer up a “sandwich”, as one analyst put it, that praises the Russian army’s “victory” while preparing the population for a grinding and painful conflict as status quo. Ukrainian officials in particular have warned that Putin is planning to announce a mass mobilisation, or even to declare war against Ukraine, calling up personnel and resources that were untapped under Russia’s so-called “special operation” that began on 24 February. “Russia has already moved to covert mobilisation and is preparing to announce open mobilisation in the near future,” said Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine’s military intelligence, in an interview this week with the Ukrainian news outlet New Times. “I’m quite curious: how will they explain this to their own people?” The Kremlin has denied it is planning a mobilisation, although some Russians have leaked call-up papers and state orders relating to a potential mobilisation online. A number of enlistment offices have been targeted in arson attacks since March, including one in remote Nizhnevartovsk last week as rumours of a coming mobilisation grew. But a formal mobilisation, which could see tens of thousands of reservists pulled from their jobs, and borders closed to fighting-age men, is something that Russia has never managed before. It would be highly disruptive to the economy and would further raise the stakes in a war where Russia has already disappointed on the battlefield. “Proclaiming mobilisation will make this war highly unpopular,” said Pavel Luzin, a Russian military expert. He also questioned whether it would be “technically possible” – “What can you do with the mobilised people? Which officers and military units can deal with them?” “This is no magic pill for them, it’s not a get-out-of-jail free card for Putin,” Edmonds said, noting that by the time new troops were brought up, the “Russians could be falling apart”. Fearing defeat, Russia may threaten to raise the stakes even further. Top propagandist Dmitry Kiselyov showed a simulation of a nuclear strike against the UK on national television this week. “Just one launch, Boris, and England is gone,” he said. “Once and for all. Why play with us?” Putin may also hint at the potential for nuclear conflict as he stands before the heavy weaponry, including intercontinental ballistic missiles, that he returned to the Red Square parade in 2008. “He also knows that we’re going to be listening to him, so I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s some nuclear rhetoric in there as well,” said the CNA’s Edmonds. He said he remained sceptical that Russia could use a tactical nuclear weapon in the conflict, but like others noted that the Kremlin has become more unpredictable. “If Putin sees this as becoming existential, then all bets are off the table.” Seeing the limited potential for victory, Putin could also seek to de-escalate the conflict. Standing before his military and the country on Monday, Putin could announce that Russia has achieved its major war aims in Ukraine by allegedly destroying Ukrainian military capacity, and by taking near control of several mid-sized cities such as Mariupol and Kherson. But that may also be a tough sell, as the Ukrainian military could try to retake lost ground, leading to further losses even if Russia stakes a defensive position. A senior Russian official last week in Kherson said that Russia had returned “forever,” making the idea of a political settlement that would return control of its territory to Ukraine even more remote. And as Ben Noble, an associate professor of Russian politics at University College London, noted, the Kremlin’s vague and changing war aims have meant that many people in Russia may be left unsatisfied with whatever Putin eventually claims as victory. “That’s probably the strongest reason why many people say that the Kremlin is in a corner now, that they’re stuck, because they’re inevitably going to disappoint some groups with whatever they claim as a victory in the broader term,” he said. Expectations of a big announcement on 9 May, he said, may speak more to the frustration among those outside the Kremlin than to the fact that anything meaningful will be announced. “They want a sense of certainty, they want a new chapter in this conflict,” he said. While the Kremlin may feel political and economic pressure to end the war, a grinding conflict may be better than admitting defeat. “I assume he will use the 9th of May to somehow address the victory … something a lot of sociologists tell us is that Russians want this to be over but in a good way,” said Anton Barbashin, the editorial director at Riddle Russia and a political analyst. “But I would expect that he also needs to introduce some new challenges as well. It needs to be a sandwich, it can’t be just victory. There is so much going on, and by now Putin is aware of the economic risks and problems that are going to arise quite soon. So you probably need to propose a strong vision of how Russia is challenged.” That is already visible in state media reports that explain Russia is at war with Nato rather than just with Ukraine in order to justify some of the military’s recent defeats. The Kremlin is also facing an urgent ideological challenge, Barbashin noted, as the war increasingly begins to affect ordinary Russians who may not have a clear idea of why Russia decided that it would invade Ukraine in the first place. “The more I think of it, the more astonishing it is that this war has shown that Russia has no ideology whatsoever,” he said. “They’re trying to come up with something new but none of it actually makes sense. Russians do not understand what the hell Russia is doing there.”",News/World news,Putin’s choices filled with peril on eve of Victory Day parade ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/07/putin-choices-are-filled-with-peril-on-the-eve-of-victory-day-parade-russia-ukraine
5/8/2022,"Liam Marshall’s late try ensured Wigan Warriors qualified for the Challenge Cup final at the expense of their great rivals, St Helens, whose magnificent second-half fightback was ultimately in vain. Trailing 14-0 at half-time and with several of their key men visibly struggling with injuries, it seemed a formality that the Saints’ defence of the cup would end in routine fashion here in Leeds. However, three tries in 15 minutes turned a thrilling semi-final on its head and moved Kristian Woolf’s side into a four-point lead with ten minutes remaining. But as the Saints went in search of the try that would seal victory, Jonny Lomax’s stray pass was collected by Marshall, who raced the length of the field to give Harry Smith a simple conversion and book Wigan’s place at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium later this month. The Warriors’ victory means that Matty Peet will lead his hometown club out in the biggest game of the year in his first season as a head coach, and his side were ultimately deserved winners here. They were much the better of the two sides in the first half, taking an early lead when Marshall broke the deadlock after being freed by Jake Bibby. Wigan then doubled that lead when Cade Cust dummied his way across the line before Liam Farrell exploited a mistake from Lomax to go in under the posts, with Harry Smith converting for the first time to make it 14-0 at the interval. St Helens had to score first after half-time to stand any chance but even when they did that courtesy of Konrad Hurrell, they were still eight points behind. However, they then clawed the deficit back further when Lomax crossed on the following set, before James Roby moved the Saints in front for the first time with a remarkable try and suddenly, St Helens led by four points. However, just when it seemed that the reigning Super League champions would hang on, Lomax’s loose pass was collected by Marshall to swing the pendulum back in Wigan’s favour, and they negotiated a frantic final few moments to book their place in the final.",Sport/Sport,Liam Marshall double edges Wigan past St Helens and into Challenge Cup final,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/07/wigan-st-helens-challenge-cup-rugby-league-match-report
5/8/2022,"The Conservatives lost but Labour didn’t win. In a messy night with multiple cross-currents, voters turned against the Tories in many areas, yet an uneven Labour performance failed to fully dispel doubts about its appeal to the electorate. Tory nerves will be jangling after a heartland slump and the loss of prized London councils, but Labour strategists will also be anxious about mediocre performances in the leave-leaning battlegrounds of England. It was the Liberal Democrats who had the happiest night on Thursday, posting hundreds of gains up and down the country, while the Greens made major gains as voters sought alternatives to an unpopular government and an unconvincing opposition. A heartland slump and hundreds of seat losses will put new pressure on the prime minister, but his opponent, Keir Starmer, may also face criticism after failing to deliver a knockout. This was on any measure a bad night for the Conservatives, who won 30% on the BBC’s projected national share (PNS) calculation, which adjusts for variations in the areas up for election in each local election cycle. This was down four points on 2018, when the seats up this week were last contested, and six points on 2021. The Tory poll slump has been matched at the ballot box, with nearly 350 English council seats lost, almost a quarter of the party’s starting total. Labour’s projected 35% was up four points on last year, and gave the opposition the largest lead over the government since 2012. There was plenty for the party to cheer about, as the opposition gained seats and took control of councils across all three British nations. But Labour’s overall vote share was no better than four years ago, and the party’s progress was uneven. Advance in Scotland and Wales was easier as seats in both countries were last up in 2017, giving Labour a lower starting point. Labour made some dramatic breakthroughs in London and an overall gain in the south of England, but its vote share stagnated in the Midlands and fell back in the north, suffering overall net seat losses across both crucial battleground regions. The Liberal Democrats won a huge haul of more than 200 net seat gains, beating all expectations as disgruntled voters in Tory heartlands swung to the party across England, with gains in Scotland and Wales too. The Greens were also smiling after a third strong showing in a row in local elections, up by an average of four points on 2018 in seats they contested both times, with concentrated surges helping them to capture more than 60 English seats, often on huge swings. While the local results will be sifted for portents of progress or decline in the next general election, the election with the most immediate political consequences was in Northern Ireland, where Sinn Féin made political history by becoming the first nationalist party ever to top the poll in the province. Yet this, too, was a messy result defying simple interpretation. Sinn Féin did not win new support, it simply held its vote together while the unionist vote disintegrated, with a large swing away from the DUP to the anti-Northern Ireland protocol TUV. And in an election with potentially seismic consequences for the balance of power between unionists and nationalists, the biggest gains were made by the Alliance, a party that rejects sectarian politics altogether. Change is in the air in Northern Ireland, though what form that change will take remains unclear. London grabbed the early headlines on Friday, as the Conservatives suffered a meltdown in the capital, with a dismal result exceeding the most pessimistic pre-election predictions, losing three high-profile councils with only the unexpected gain of Harrow to brighten an otherwise dark night. Labour had not run any of Barnet, Wandsworth or Westminster for nearly 50 years. Now they control all three. The red tide has been rising in the capital for many years, and with Labour now in control of Margaret Thatcher’s favourite council and the seat of government itself, the capital is close to becoming a one-party state. Yet while this was a worst-case scenario for the Conservatives, the underlying trends driving their decline are not new. All the pro-Labour currents in today’s politics converge in London, which is younger, more ethnically diverse, more graduate heavy and more on the remain side than the nation as a whole. While a Conservative decline in London was expected, a collapse for the government in its heartlands was not. The Tories are now suffering a major bout of southern discomfort – the fall in Tory support was much larger in the south than the north or Midlands, and largest of all in the southern bastions where they performed best in 2018. Tory decline in the Home Counties, already evident in the 2019 general election, has intensified. Southern Tory MPs will be getting nervous, as double-digit swings to the Lib Dems suggest even those with large majorities may not be safe from a revolt of disgruntled middle-class professionals. The anxiety will intensify if the forthcoming Tiverton byelection brings defeat in another heartland seat that has hitherto returned Tory MPs for a century. After five years as the punchbag of coalition, and four as the tribunes of remain, the Lib Dems are recovering their traditional role as the catch-all party of protest. The third party bested the Conservatives up and down the country, from David Cameron’s West Oxfordshire to Tim Farron’s Westmorland and Furness. Lib Dem activists will be particularly heartened by a strong recovery in Somerset, a leave-leaning former heartland area where their vote had been decimated by coalition and Brexit. The party will hope Thursday’s sweeping gains, which delivered control of the newly created council, will be a harbinger of recovery in its erstwhile heartlands of the south-west. This was another strong election cycle for the Greens, whose advance in local elections is posing new questions for all of the parties. The Greens now provide a new challenger for Labour in many urban strongholds and for the Conservatives in remain-leaning bits of their heartlands. The Liberal Democrats face competition for protest votes in graduate-heavy places, while in Scotland the Greens are challenging the SNP for pro-independence voters. Three big seat hauls in a row mean the Greens are now an established presence on councils across Britain, though it remains to be seen whether they can use a growing local presence as a springboard to credible general election campaigns. Beneath the headlines is a complicated set of results that defy simple interpretation. The opposition have bounced back strongly on their 2021 lows, and done best in the most pro-leave areas of England. A messy result will do little to resolve internal party debates, as each side will pick the data to suit their story. For example, supporters of Keir Starmer will point to big swings since last year as evidence that Labour is recovering from a historic collapse in 2019. His critics will say stagnant support and seat losses show that Starmer’s approach is not delivering results, even against a floundering government in crisis. Both sides have a point. Labour are recovering but have a lot of work still to do. Neither will these results provide resolution to the Conservative debate over Boris Johnson’s leadership. Hundreds of seat losses and a heartland collapse will hand potent ammunition to his opponents, yet loyalists will point to a relatively strong showing in the English battlegrounds as evidence that this hold on leave voters’ affections remains intact. Keeping Johnson could add fuel to a southern heartlands revolt, but replacing him with a central-casting Conservative could trigger a red wall backlash. The prime minister’s fate may turn on which of these risks worries his MPs most.

5/8/2022,"Arizona water authorities are bracing for additional cuts to the quantity of water supplied by the Colorado River, prompting calls for more aggressive conservation measures to prevent further reductions. Officials in Arizona state predict that these cuts could come as soon as August, the Phoenix NBC Affiliate 12 News reported Friday. These expected cuts stem from the effects of a decades-long megadrought, which has been greatly exacerbated by the climate crisis. Moreover, the Colorado River, which provides water to almost 40 million people, has been imperiled due to decades of overuse. The river’s reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, have seen worsening declines in their water levels. Arizona is typically granted 2.8m acre-feet of water from the Colorado River. The US Bureau of Reclamation, which manages water and hydropower in the south-west, declared its first water shortage in 2021; federal mandates and state-based efforts resulted in Arizona leaving 500,000 acre-feet “behind Hoover Dam” this year, according to AZCentral.com. The Bureau of Reclamation makes mandates based on water levels in Lake Mead, which are determined by upstream disbursements from Lake Powell. The water level in Lake Powell has approached the minimum required to produce hydropower that provides electricity for several million residents, AZCentral.com said. Arizona’s department of water resources, and Central Arizona Project (CAP), have insisted that the state must take further measures to save water. Tom Buschatzke, the water department’s director, said that if the reclamation bureau predicts further cuts in 2023, “there should be serious consideration by water providers to start going down that path”. “Most of the water use is outside the home,” Ted Cooke, CAP Deputy director, reportedly said to 12 News. “It’s in the yard, it’s pools, it’s plants, it’s lawns.” While Arizona water providers have never required residential water reductions, some city governments did curtail their own usage amid a severe dry period in 2004. Buschatzke said that if water from the Rocky Mountain snowpack does not boost the reservoirs in 2023, a more serious shortage could impact Arizona cities’ water supplies. “Look at all of those factors and it’s probably time to start doing something at the homeowner level or the business level,” Buschatzke told AZCentral. “I can’t dictate that, but I might urge those folks to consider doing that.” Officials said that Arizona homeowners are not likely to see “dry taps” anytime soon, as there have been initiatives to store unused Colorado River water in underground aquifers. However, it’s possible that cities will consider tapping these reserves for outdoor purposes, which could start depleting them – without any clear path to replenishing the water, AZCentral.com reported. In addition to Arizona, potential water cuts next year could also impact Nevada and Mexico and, eventually, California. “The gravity of the immediate situation is serious,” Buschatzke, told The Los Angeles Times. “We expect further significant actions to reduce water use will be required.”",News/US news,Arizona braces for additional water cuts amid megadrought,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/07/arizona-water-cuts-megadrought-colorado-river
