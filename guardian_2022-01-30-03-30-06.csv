1/30/2022,"Progressives frustrated by failures on domestic spending and voting rights should not target Joe Manchin, the veteran Democratic operative James Carville said, because “bitching about a Democratic senator in West Virginia is missing the damn plot”.  But Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Carville said, is fair game for a primary challenge. Manchin and Sinema are moderates with outsized power in a Senate split 50-50 and controlled by the vice-president’s casting vote. In December, Manchin sank Joe Biden’s $1tn Build Back Better domestic spending package, which among other goals seeks to boost child and healthcare and to combat the climate crisis. In January, Manchin and Sinema refused to back reform to the filibuster, the Senate rule by which most legislation must attract 60 votes, ending hopes of passing voting rights protections in answer to restrictive laws passed by Republicans in state government. Amid fury on the left, Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator and progressive figurehead, promised to campaign against both his Senate colleagues. Carville is a colorful figure, widely known as the Ragin’ Cajun, who made his name in Bill Clinton’s run to the White House in 1992. In a wide-ranging interview with Vox, he said progressive anger should focus on Sinema. “Understand that Joe Manchin is a Roman Catholic Democrat in a state in which not a single county has voted Democrat [for president] since 2008,” Carville said. “Politics is about choices and he’s up for re-election in 2024. If Manchin runs for re-election, I’ll do everything I can to help him because it’s either going to be Joe Manchin or Marsha Blackburn. It ain’t Joe Manchin or Ed Markey.” Blackburn is a hard-right Republican from Tennessee, Markey a progressive Democrat from Massachusetts. “You got to understand that,” Carville said. “It’s really that damn simple. Now the situation with Sinema in Arizona is … entirely different.” Sinema presents herself as a “blue dog” Democrat, or moderate, in a state which has two Democratic senators for the first time since 1952. But her willingness to stand in the way of Joe Biden’s legislative program led her own state party to issue a formal censure last week. “I can’t explain it,” Carville said, “and no one else can. The only explanation people have given is that she wants to be the next John McCain.” McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, won himself a reputation as a political maverick, for example, bringing down Donald Trump’s attempt to scrap the Affordable Care Act in a dramatic vote. Sinema, Carville said, was “not going to win a primary against [the Arizona congressman] Ruben Gallego, I’ll tell you that damn much. And I will personally volunteer to help him fundraise because I think we can keep that seat if he runs.” Echoing other observers, Carville said Manchin’s opposition to Biden measures like an expired child tax credit was “extraordinary”, given how people in his state have struggled under the coronavirus pandemic. But polling in West Virginia shows support for Manchin’s stand against Build Back Better. “I’ll just keep saying it,” Carville said. “If we don’t have Senator Manchin, we’re going to have somebody really, really, really extreme in his seat. “Some of these people bitching about Manchin can’t see political reality straight. Six percent of adults in this country identify as ‘progressive’. Only 11% or 12% of Democrats identify as progressive. So let’s just meet in the middle and say something like 7% or 8% of the country agrees with the progressive left. “This ain’t a goddamn debate anymore. Someone like Manchin is closer to the mainstream than a lot of these people think, and pretending like he isn’t won’t help the cause.” Carville also criticized Democrats for targeting un-winnable elections, such as a 2020 attempt to unseat Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate leader, in Kentucky. “We’re addicted to hopeless causes,” he said, advocating a focus on state contests to decide who gets to pass laws like those restricting voting rights which Republicans have passed by the dozen. “What about the secretary of state in Wisconsin? Or the attorney general race in Michigan? How much money are Democrats and progressives sending to those candidates? “I’m telling you, if Democrats are worried about voting rights and election integrity, then these are the sorts of races they should support and volunteer for, because this is where the action is and this is where things will be decided. “You know who is paying attention to these races? The Republican party. Last I checked, Republicans raised $33m for secretary of state races around the country. The Democrats had until recently raised $1m. I think it’s now up to $4m. That’s the story, right there. That’s the difference, right there. “Bitching about a Democratic senator in West Virginia is missing the damn plot.”",News/US news,James Carville: Democrats should take out Sinema but leave Joe Manchin alone,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/29/james-carville-democrats-sinema-joe-manchin-senate
1/30/2022,"In 1990, Nessun Dorma, the aria from Puccini’s Turandot, sung by the Luciano Pavarotti, became the soundtrack to the World Cup in a marriage of high culture and the beautiful game. That union is to be revived for the 2022 World Cup with a new opera celebrating the world’s most popular sport and featuring a chorus of football fans who will undergo a crash course in operatic techniques.  Gods of the Game: A Football Opera will be staged at Grange Park Opera in Surrey in October, and broadcast soon afterwards on Sky Arts. Directed by Kwame Kwei-Armah, the artistic director of the Young Vic, it tells the story of two childhood friends who become football stars. In the course of leading their country’s bid to host a World Cup tournament, they encounter bribery and corruption. The pair enlist the support of the “gods of the game” to ensure that righteousness prevails. Phil Porter, the work’s librettist, said: “The opera imagines a world in which the world’s greatest ever footballers – from Pelé and Maradona through to Messi and Ronaldo – exist as gods, watching over the global game. “The characters and events of the story are otherwise fictional, but very much inspired by the drama of international football. Famous on-field shenanigans like Maradona’s ‘hand of God’, Zidane’s extra-time head-butt, and Luis Suárez’s fondness for biting opposing players were rich sources of inspiration. And though our characters are invented, we have inevitably drawn from the many great characters that have played football at the top level – hardmen like Roy Keane and Stefan Effenberg, flawed geniuses from George Best to Maradona, modern icons like Megan Rapinoe and the famously self-assured Zlatan Ibrahimović.” More than 100 football fans will be recruited for the “footy fan chorus”. After intensive training, they will be filmed performing a specially composed chorus at a UK stadium. The footage will be projected as part of the opera. Wasfi Kani, the chief executive of Grange Park Opera, said: “There are various footballing fraternities for whom singing is an essential part of their fandom. We’re switched into those, and we’ll find a particular bunch and then expand.” Kani said she was not a football fan and had “no interest in any sport at all”. But with her second company, Pimlico Opera, she had worked with prisoners on productions of operas and musicals inside jails but open to the public. “Training nonprofessionals is quite doable, human beings are very creative creatures,” she said. Matching a game of football, the opera will last for 90 minutes. It will be sung in English and include snatches of famous arias amid original music by a team of five composers. Kwei-Armah said he was incredibly excited about the project. “Opera. Football. A marriage made in heaven. Both full of passion, drama and charismatic stars.” The 2022 World Cup is due to take place in Qatar from 21 November to 18 December. The tournament has been dogged by controversies, including allegations of secret payments to secure support for Qatar’s bid and human rights abuses suffered by the migrant workforce hired to build stadiums and infrastructure. About 1.5 million tourists are expected to visit the Gulf state during the month-long tournament, although only 130,000 rooms are available in hotels, on cruise ships and at desert “glamp” sites. Opera has increasingly tackled contemporary issues, including Between Worlds, about the events of 9/11, and CO2, about the climate crisis.",Arts/Music,It’s a World Cup opera … starring 100 fans who already know the score,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/29/world-cup-opera-starring-100-fans-who-already-know-the-score-gods-of-the-game
1/30/2022,"Schools that ended the requirement for pupils to wear face coverings this month, in line with government guidance, are reinstating it again because of surges in Covid cases. The government rescinded the requirement for masks in secondary school classrooms in England on 20 January and since 27 January they have no longer been compulsory in communal indoor spaces either. But a number of schools that complied with the change in the rules are having to reintroduce them a week later because of outbreaks in infections.  In some areas, including Enfield in north London, Calderdale in West Yorkshire, and Hertfordshire, public health teams are now recommending that masks be temporarily reinstated in schools where there are significant outbreaks. At least nine education authorities are also advising that masks remain in place in the schools’ communal areas, despite the change in national guidance. In south-west London, a number of secondaries told parents on Friday that a rise in cases meanst some year groups would have to resume wearing face coverings indoors and take daily lateral flow tests. Official figures published by the Department for Education last week show that Covid-related pupil absence in England has jumped by 100,000 in two weeks. A total of 415,000 children – just over 5% of the state school intake – were absent on 20 January, up from 3.9% on 6 January. More than three-quarters of absent pupils had tested positive for Covid. At nearly a quarter of state schools, more than 15% of teachers and leaders were off work. In total, 9% of heads and teachers – 47,000 – were absent on 20 January, up from 44,000 two weeks previously. A similar proportion of teaching assistants and other staff were also out of school. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “It is very likely that we are going to see increased disruption in schools across the next weeks, with cases rising among both primary and secondary pupils. The government has acted prematurely in removing face masks and has acted tardily in providing ventilation solutions.” The decision on masks in schools comes as new research underlines just how significantly reinfections are fuelling the pandemic. Before Omicron appeared, protection against symptomatic reinfection for previous variants – such as Delta – was above 90%. But this fell to 56% with Omicron, meaning those who have suffered once previously are much more likely to suffer again, according to a study by researchers at the Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar research centre. Scientists have been trying to establish how much of the Omicron wave has been driven by reinfections and on Monday the government’s Covid dashboard will begin publishing data about reinfections in the UK. “We know that reinfections are much more common with Omicron,” said Paul Hunter, professor of health protection at the University of East Anglia. “But there are a number of issues – are they less severe? The balance of evidence is that they are less severe than primary infections.” New research by scientists at the UK Health Security Agency conducted during the Alpha wave showed that reinfected people were much less likely to die, with 61% fewer deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Last week, the React study published its latest report which included data that nearly two thirds of 3,582 people who had been infected with Omicron said they had previously had Covid. The researchers from Imperial College London and Ipsos Mori cautioned that not all of those were necessarily reinfections – some may be people who had received a positive PCR test in its study who were still getting over a recent infection. Deciding what counts as a reinfection is part of the problem with attempts to measure it. When the Covid dashboard starts to include reinfection data, repeat positive cases will only be counted separately as a reinfection if there is a gap of at least 90 days. That means that an unknown proportion of people who were infected during the third wave this winter with Delta, and then subsequently contracted Omicron, will not be included as new infections. “Normally reinfections aren’t a problem, but it’s a becoming a problem because reinfections are occurring rather more frequently with Omicron than before,” Hunter said. “So when we’ve got the reinfection data, is that going to change what we understand about the direction of travel of this epidemic? Will adding reinfections make it look like, actually, it’s not levelled off and dipping again, but increasing still rapidly? “Or will it mean that, actually, a lot of those reinfections occurred at the peak, and they’re dropping even faster than we thought?”",News/World news,Schools in England reinstate mask wearing rules as Covid and absenteeism soar,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/29/schools-in-england-reinstate-mask-wearing-rules-as-covid-and-absenteeism-soar
1/30/2022,"Next month, it will be 20 years since the Pop Idol final. Watched by 15 million viewers, Will Young triumphed over Gareth Gates with 53.1% of a record 8.7 million votes. It wasn’t just the start of things for Young and Gates, it marked the birth of a cultural phenomenon: the television talent show. In 2004, one of the Pop Idol judges, Simon Cowell, launched The X Factor in the UK, a primetime weekend TV show to discover new singing talent.  Right now, The X Factor is “resting”, believed permanently shelved, which counts as a mercy killing. After 15 series, it was a shadow of its former self: a formulaic karaoke-panto of nosediving ratings, hammy showboating, and forgettable contestants. The last UK winner – Dalton Harris in 2018 – stepped out into a swamp of indifference. Nor is Cowell the all-powerful starmaker, the primetime Barnum, he used to be: his recent ITV venture, Walk the Line, was axed after one series due to poor viewing figures. How different from when The X Factor was an unstoppable ratings juggernaut, syndicating to 80 countries, spawning an international franchise, including a US version. The sociocultural impact went yet further, changing the shape, ethos, the very DNA, of mainstream culture – music industry practice; television programming – and rezoning the aspirations of starstruck youth, making them want to be pop stars instead of teachers, nurses or shop assistants, in a way many thought to be irresponsible. In a broader sense, did talent show culture have a small but significant effect on how ordinary people thought, reacted, perhaps even voted for real? Is this part of the legacy of this form of television: as much as it entertained, did it also make us more stupid? At the start of the 21st century, talent shows already differed from each other. Pop Idol and, later that year, Popstars: The Rivals, which formed Girls Aloud, were different to Popstars (2001), which put together Hear’Say and was billed as a documentary series about the making of a pop group. None of them bore much resemblance to talent shows of the past, such as New Faces or, earlier, Opportunity Knocks. The X Factor turned out to be a different beast again: at once sentimental and cynical. It was lucky to emerge at a time when the music industry was wrongfooted by streaming and illegal file-sharing, and, just as crucially, when social media was on the rise. Cowell, with other judges Louis Walsh and Sharon Osbourne, positioned himself as a harsh-but-fair panto villain, bestowing lavish praise and acid putdowns. A music business executive, Cowell regarded himself as a talent-spotter, which raised eyebrows in music circles where he was known for dealing with acts such as Sinitta, Robson & Jerome, and the Teletubbies. But Cowell didn’t care about “cool”. A defiant anti-snob, his affinity was with unfashionable but vast markets; his aim was to make money. The X Factor made huge global stars of the likes of One Direction, Leona Lewis and Little Mix, leading to swathes of the music industry becoming symbiotically linked with, and at times overly subservient to, talent show culture. The cultural pushback was immense. In 2009, in a move which seemed to be overwrought and a little spiteful, a song by Rage Against The Machine was pitted against The X Factor winner Joe McElderry’s version of Miley Cyrus’s The Climb, beating it to the Christmas No 1 spot. Many contestants, including the first winner in 2004, Steve Brookstein, have complained about being badly treated. Others have spoken of being left with mental health issues. Elsewhere, criticism focused variously on the product – lame karaoke, suffocating everything else in the music industry, sucking up valuable resources – and also the effect on youth. In 2016, the then-Conservative education secretary, Nicky Morgan, worried: “[They] will look at The X Factor winners, or they will look at reality TV shows, and they will think you can have instant success, fame, money, overnight”. Singer-songwriter Annie Lennox said: “You wouldn’t find a Joni Mitchell on X Factor … X Factor is a specific thing for people that want to go through that process – it’s a factory, you know, and it’s owned and stitched up by puppet masters.” In their long poem, Brand New Ancients, Kae Tempest wrote scathingly of Cowell as “the permatanned god of our age”, asking “Why is this interesting? Why are we watching?” Was there a strain of dark populism in shows like The X Factor, a coarsening of culture, and of public discourse? Certainly, television was changed for ever. Rival shows included Fame Academy (following Pop Idol), The Voice, which launched its spinning chairs in the UK in 2012, all the way to last year’s frankly risible I Can See Your Voice on BBC One. Another Cowell vehicle, the variety-based Britain’s Got Talent, launched singer Susan Boyle and dance troupe Diversity – who supplied the most exciting talent show moment of recent years with the controversial on-stage kneel in homage to Black Lives Matter in 2020. Elsewhere, there are celebrity-driven interactive-voting shows (Strictly Come Dancing; I’m A Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here!). And of course, the other gigantic phenomenon: reality television. Pop Idol and The X Factor were contemporaneous with Big Brother, and you can see The X Factor’s fingerprints all over shows such as The Only Way Is Essex. That sense of, one way or another, it was time for ordinary people to be stars. In this way, The X Factor grasped a huge emerging truth: that significant numbers of people were tired of rarefied celebrity; leastways, they were weary of being excluded from it. They didn’t want to look up to people any more, they wanted to look across. If it couldn’t be them, they wanted someone who looked, spoke and lived like them. In this way, class was hugely important to talent shows like The X Factor, which, significantly, focused on singing – no need to afford an instrument, or the lessons to learn one. Before long, there were two main types of contestant: those who were already grubbing about trying to make it in music, and those who came out of nowhere. Which suited Cowell and the television executives: members of the public are cheaper than entertainers, and more mouldable. What emerged was a personality-first culture, driven less by ability than by the concepts of the “journey” and “likeability”. Who had the most heart-rending upbringing? Who had the best “dead-gran” story? The result was soapy, farcical, but also, at times, powerful and moving: these were real people, after all. More recently, the dating show Love Island could be viewed as the endgame of the formula: contestants getting by on personality/likeability and no discernible talent other than looking good in a swimsuit. As ever, the voting public, the Roman emperors of the remote control, give the thumbs up or down. Considering such influence, why did The X Factor run aground? It would appear to be a combination of changing trends (mainstream music has become too hardcore for mainstream television), a flogged-to-death format, the growth of influencer culture and the likes of Kim Kardashian, and the rise of TikTok, where people can generate millions using only camera phones. What did it all mean in the end? In positive terms: some talented artists, a Saturday night giggle, a true sense of democratised culture, a window on to the UK. Negatively: regurgitated culture, flattening of music elsewhere, the lie that everyone is a star. In a wider sense, what has it done to us? Boris Johnson became prime minister, trading on his likability: ruffling his hair, dangling from a zip-wire. Did the cult of likability lumber us with a leader who couldn’t be trusted to obey his own lockdown rules? Maybe, maybe not. One thing’s for sure, the talent show will be back. They’re the knotweed of popular culture: they come, they go, then they return in a different form. You can never quite get rid of them.",Arts/Television & radio,Life after Will Young: how talent shows shaped Britain,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/29/life-after-will-young-how-talent-shows-shaped-britain
1/30/2022,"On the coastline around Kaikōura, the rocks seem to be moving. Jutting from the sea, shimmering in the summer heat, their grey planes begin to shift and ripple. Step closer and you recognise them, first by their sound: a distant honking, barking, yelping. Then, by their smell: thick and potent, a mixture of kelp and excrement. Seals, hundreds of them, possibly thousands, are coming ashore for pupping. They roll in constant, joyful helixes in the rock pools, emerge from the sea to glisten like puddles of oil, or bask unmoving in the sun like comatose adolescents recovering from a hangover.  Once they would have been even thicker on these shorelines. Before humans came to New Zealand, millions of fur seals populated the coasts. They were hunted almost to extinction, but in the century since the sealing industry collapsed, they have become a protected species and started to flourish, recovering to more than 200,000. That comeback has not been without complications. As seal numbers have grown, their colonies increasingly expand into areas of human habitation – bringing them into increasing, troublesome, occasionally violent contact with people. Fur seals are not to be trifled with. While they look ungainly out of the water, they can move on land at a brisk 20km/h – an alarming speed for up to 180kg of solid muscle and blubber. They can be aggressive and will bite when provoked. When one group of researchers required DNA specimens, for example, they had enormous trouble getting close enough to jab the creatures’ blubber for a sample. The scientists finally landed on a strategy – borrowing riot shields from the local police station. They would take a boat to the rocks, disembark with riot shields up, attempt to keep balance on slick, seaweed-covered rocks and spend as short a time as possible poking increasingly enraged seals as they lunged. “Those were pretty interesting days for collecting,” Dr Adrian Paterson says. An associate professor at Lincoln University studying New Zealand’s ecological evolution, Paterson and his colleagues used genome sequencing from those samples to reverse-calculate the size of New Zealand’s historic seal populations. They landed on the figure of about 3 million. “One of the things that motivated our research was just saying, ‘Well, how many seals were there in the past? How much bigger could the population get? What can be sustained effectively by the seas around us?’ And basically, what we found was that the population could get huge – hugely larger and much more widespread.” A huge and growing population of seals would be both an enormous conservation victory and a thorny question for New Zealand’s human populations, who live in sometimes uneasy proximity to them. “That’s a big question for society for the next couple of decades, because you’ll have your million-dollar property by the sea, and if a smelly fur seal colony turns up that’s not going to be good for your property value,” Paterson says. “As tensions rise in the future with more and more human-seal contact, it’ll be interesting to see how that pans out.” At times those tensions can erupt into shocking violence. Harming a seal is a criminal offence in New Zealand, punishable by up to two years in prison or a fine of up to $250,000 – but the years have been marked by occasional ugly incidents of seals being targeted for sport or in disturbing killing sprees. Last month Department of Conservation (DoC) rangers found 19 seals dead at this lookout – at least nine of which they determined had recently been shot. In 2010 two men who worked on a salmon farm were charged with clubbing 23 seals to death. The men, who were found guilty, argued the seals were pests that had depleted the fishing stocks. In 2005, former All Black Andrew Hore and two other men returned from a fishing trip and shot and killed at least one seal on the coast. “It was extremely distressing – actually heartbreaking,” says Dr Jody Weir, of the seals killed last month. A senior marine biodiversity ranger based in Kaikōura, she was one of those who had to deal with the incident, and her voice is emotional as she looks out over the colony. “It’s not the norm, however – 99% of people have a great respect for this ecosystem and the amazing animals that play a part. There are a few people that have misguided ideas.” There’s a misconception among fishers, Weir and Paterson say, that seals are consuming the fish that people want to catch. In fact most of their diet is lanternfish and octopus. But even their presence – smelly, territorial, unsafe to approach – can raise some people’s hackles. “They are dangerous animals, you don’t want them to bite you,” Paterson says, “You’ve got to be careful around them and that just adds to the tensions.” This month, working along the Kaikōura coastline, Weir is in the middle of a pup count – the first since the 2016 Kaikōura earthquakes radically reshaped the shoreline and displaced some of the fur seal colonies. She walks the shoreline armed with binoculars and a pair of clickers, counting how many new pups are being born in the colony. “You want your movements to be slow, but not sneaky,” she says, edging down a hillside to get a better look at a collection of pups playing in a rock pool. A specialist in animal behaviour, Weir says conservation involves understanding both wildlife and human activity – “because, of course, we’re animals as well” – and attempting to ease friction between them. “With the fur seal colony changing and growing … this isn’t something that’s going to go away. Fur seals are here now, thank goodness, they’re part of the system. So how do we learn to grow alongside them to minimise those kinds of conflict?” She points to a new stretch of fencing, installed to stop seals getting stuck on the highway. They were sometimes hit by cars – a disaster for both the seal and any bumper hitting a 300 pound animal at speed. So far the fence seems to have worked: a small step to ease the relationship between the marine mammals and their bipedal neighbours. Weir says she often thinks about the hundreds of southern right whales that used to have their calves in a bay north of Kaikōura township. “There’s records in the town hall, notes about people complaining that they were too loud, that they were trumpeting, the racket of these whales,” she says. As the whaling industry arrived, they were slaughtered – and even when industry declined and the whales were protected, for decades they never returned to the bay. “It used to be that they were the pests, that they were the ones that were annoying,” she says. “If we look at that on a bigger scale and think: right now, people are grumbling about fur seals – some people, a small minority of people. But if we pan out and realise the damage that people can do, but also the treasure that is the wildlife that we have here? It helps to turn that around.”",News/World news,Riot shields and good balance: managing New Zealand’s booming fur seal population,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/30/riot-shields-and-good-balance-managing-new-zealands-booming-fur-seal-population
1/30/2022,"Unmesh Desai recalls feeling righteous frustration as he sat opposite the head of the Metropolitan police on Tuesday morning. For months Cressida Dick’s force had refused to investigate what appeared to be unambiguous breaches of Covid regulations at Downing Street. “The perception is that you’re covering for those in power,” Desai told the commissioner. Arms folded, Dick leant towards those assembled for the Greater London authority police and crime committee meeting in Southwark and responded: “We police without fear or favour.”  Moments later, at 10:08am, Dick dropped the bombshell that sent shock waves thundering a mile west to Downing Street and nearby parliament. Desai felt the room go quiet, with others clearly sharing his “total surprise,” at the commissioner’s revelation. Ditching the Met’s long-stated position of waiting for Sue Gray’s report on Downing Street’s lockdown parties, Dick announced a criminal inquiry into “serious and flagrant” breaches of lockdown rules. Five days on, however, some believe the commissioner’s lofty reference to “fear and favour” appears increasingly questionable. From refusing to investigate Downing Street’s lockdown parties, the Met’s intervention has effectively neutered the most eagerly awaited report in recent political history, an inquiry whose findings seemed likely to dictate the future of Boris Johnson. And after appearing content on Tuesday for Gray to publish her report in full, on Friday, without warning, the Met requested that the civil servant make “minimal reference” to the events it was investigating. The abrupt U-turn has left Desai and committee members believing they were duped by Dick. “Why were we not told this during the meeting? Dick has still not explained directly and publicly the rationale for this request?” Desai told the Observer. For some, the Met’s change of tack has seen talk of incompetence turn to conspiracy. Nazir Afzal, former chief prosecutor for north-west England, said the last-minute request for Gray to water down her report was troubling. “It gives the perception of collusion, the perception that they’re not acting without fear or favour.” What it means for the prime minister remains similarly open to interpretation. Some argue that it offers a reprieve, a chance for Johnson to steady the ship. Others say the Met has intensified the pressure on Gray to shoot the silver bullet. “The issue now is if the report doesn’t point the finger at Johnson, people are going to say it’s a stitch-up,” said a senior prosecution source. “At the same time Gray is under pressure to publish something and if it’s anodyne because of the Met’s request, from a government perspective that’s brilliant.” Another prosecution source, also requesting anonymity, said that the Met’s trajectory from seemingly not wanting to get involved to blundering into constitutional matters was tantamount to a “perversion of public business”. They added: “The optics look poor, from doing nothing to investigating parties in the heart of government to watering down a report that effectively may save the prime minister.” Former director of public prosecutions, Ken Macdonald, was more circumspect but could see no justifiable reason for diluting Gray’s report over what appears to be a series of fixed-penalty notices. “It seems completely disproportionate to hold up the publication of a report that’s going to shed light on what may be a public scandal,” he said. For some observers, the saga is symbolised by the Met’s use of the word “prejudice” to explain why it told Gray not to publish key passages. The term suggested that the force was investigating more serious offences than fixed-penalty notices (FPNs), offences that could be tried before a jury. Macdonald was among those who felt that the Met’s legal team must have signed off the term in its criminal law context. Yet that was not the case. Yesterday police sources insisted that the investigation was solely in “FPN territory”. “Using the word [prejudice] meant that for a crucial bit of the debate the rationale was that Sue Gray had found people systematically deleting emails or something, it was very odd,” said a senior prosecuting source. Yet an innocent explanation may well be likely. The senior prosecution source said that it was highly possible that the Met had sought legal counsel on Thursday from a cautious barrister who advised that Gray’s report couldn’t be published in full: “This is not a conspiracy and Cressida Dick is not corrupt. She’s independent and robust, and neither would No 10 take the risk [of meddling].” For others with intimate knowledge of the Met, the damaging episode should never have been allowed to happen. Dal Babu, former chief superintendent, said that the Downing Street lockdown parties should have been dealt with when details began to emerge months ago. “They should have spoken to the individuals, issued fixed-penalty notices, and that would have been that. From a policing point of view I cannot understand why it wasn’t pursued. Instead, you’ve ended up with this absolute mess,” said Babu. “Not doing anything, and suddenly doing too much, shows the police haven’t understood the political situation. There appears a level of naivety in not understanding the implications.” However, Gray, according to Babu, is not entirely blameless. He believes that the moment she found evidence of criminality she should have handed responsibility to the Met. “That hasn’t happened here for whatever reason. Despite clear evidence of criminality, it continued to be reviewed by a civilian,” he said. That civilian is expected to deliver her report on No 10 parties to the PM imminently without waiting for the police inquiry to conclude. Regardless of what Gray finds, the events of the past week may have further eroded trust in police and the government. “What’s happened has shaken public confidence in the institutions. The sooner we get light [from Gray] shed on this, the better,” said Macdonald. Afzal added that the perception that those who make the rules can bend the rules had been reinforced. “This entire issue is about integrity at the heart of public life.

It was presumably his way of welcoming Hull’s new owner, Acun Ilicali, to East Yorkshire but there was no sight of the Turkish reality TV mogul who was travelling back from a flying visit to Istanbul aboard his newly re-named private jet ‘Tiger Force One’.  There were fears that the high winds occasioned by Storm Malik would create a bumpy landing but at least Ilicali’s freshly appointed manager, Shota Arveladze had arrived. The Georgian, installed as Grant McCann’s successor last week took time to endear himself to his new public, happily posing for selfies with fans before setting about tackling the challenge of initiating an unlikely promotion challenge. Considering that Hull kicked off in 19th position in the Championship it seemed a little ambitious but Ilicali has hired the one-time Rangers and Ajax striker and former manager of Uzbekistan’s FC Pakhtakor Tashkent to secure a Premier League place and Arveladze certainly made a decent start. The wind may have been capricious but, on the pitch at least, there was no sign of turbulence. With five minutes on the clock Hull, configured with a high pressing back three, were ahead when Tom Eaves connected with the impressive Brandon Fleming’s fine cross and volleyed beyond a stranded Ben Hamer. The only shame was that Ilicali was not present to witness it. Instead the 52-year-old who, earlier this month, paid £30m to end the Allam family’s controversial 11-year stewardship of the club was delayed as his pilot struggled to land at Humberside Airport. Given that he was scheduled to arrive around the 20-minute mark, Ilicali, dubbed ‘Turkey’s Simon Cowell’ possibly missed the second goal too. It involved another cross, from George Honeyman this time, and a close-range shot from the onrushing Keane Lewis-Potter. Blessed with a lovely touch, the 20-year-old forward is very much the jewel in Hull’s crown and the owner is adamant he will reject any £20m bids from Premier League clubs on Monday, with Brentford and West Ham apparently heading the queue. Arveladze, who at 48 has also managed in Turkey and Israel, wants to pair Lewis-Potter with the much admired Iran striker Allahyar Sayyagmanesh who is on the brink of completing a £5m move from Fenerbahce. Indeed Hull are quietly confident they will soon have “the new Mo Salah” on their hands. Ilicali, who swiftly moved onto greater things after starting his career as a football reporter, is convinced he is blessed with a natural talent-spotting knack and has promised three more similarly exciting signings by Monday night. Arveladze’s existing XI looked far too strong for Swansea and the ground soon echoed to choruses of “Shota, Shota, give us a wave.” Perhaps wary of tempting fate, McCann’s successor did not oblige but had Eaves not had a second goal disallowed for a foul in the buildup Russell Martin’s side would have been three down at half time. Although Swansea improved in the second half, with Liam Walsh’s free-kick hitting a post, Hull held on comfortably enough, with Lewis-Potter deservedly named man of the match. It seemed that what Ilicali has termed a “beautiful journey” had truly begun. With the memories of Assem and Ehab Allam’s often unpopular tenure – during which failed attempts to change the club’s name from Hull City to Hull Tigers clouded two promotions to the Premier League and an FA Cup final appearance – receding, the new owner has promised £2 match tickets for under-16s and seniors. But why Hull? Ilicali says it is about love and he was smitten by Hull the first time he visited. “Hull has the Humber Bridge like Istanbul has the Bosphorus bridge,” he has said. “This is a sign of destiny. Even the (orange) shirt colours attracted me so much. This is now my city and my team.” He regards Leicester as a role model and believes his new club can, one day, emulate their success. “This club has the potential to win trophies,” he insists. “There is nothing Leicester has that Hull does not.” The bar seems ominously high for Arveladze but this was a convincingly surefooted start.",Sport/Football,Keane Lewis-Potter sinks Swansea to give ambitious Hull owner liftoff,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/29/hull-swansea-championship-match-report
