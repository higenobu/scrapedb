2/1/2022,"Along Tombo’s crumbling waterfront, dozens of hand-painted wooden boats are arriving in the blistering midday sun with the day’s catch for the scrum of the market in one of Sierra Leone’s largest fishing ports. In a scrap of shade at the bustling dock, Joseph Fofana, a 36-year-old fisherman, is repairing a torn net. Fofana says he earns about 50,000 leone (£3.30) for a brutal, 14-hour day at sea, crammed in with 20 men, all paying the owner for use of his vessel. “This is the only job we can do,” he says. “It’s not my choice. God carried me here. But we are suffering.”  Every day, about 13,000 small boats like Fofana’s cast off from Sierra Leone’s 314-mile (506km) coastline. Fisheries employ 500,000 of the west African nation’s nearly 8 million people, represent 12% of the economy and are the source of 80% of the population’s protein consumption. But a dozen fishermen interviewed by the Guardian say their catch is dwindling rapidly due to sustained overfishing on a large scale. “Many years ago, you could see fish in the water from here, even big ones,” says Fofana. “Not any more. There’s less fish than ever before.” Tombo’s fishing community put the blame squarely on foreign fleets. About 40% of industrial licences are owned by Chinese vessels; though legal, locals say they pay meagre fees for their permits, under-declare their catch and add little to the local economy. At the same time, illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing is a huge problem, costing Sierra Leone $50m a year, President Julius Maada Bio said in 2018. Last year, a joint operation by the Sierra Leonean navy and the conservation organisation Sea Shepherd Global led to the arrest of five foreign-owned fishing vessels in two days, including two Chinese-flagged trawlers found to be fishing without a licence. Those in Tombo who have protested at the illegal fishing say they face violence from the crews. Alusine Kargbo, a 34-year-old mackerel fisherman, says trawlers’ crews threw boiling water at him when he confronted them over fishing in areas where trawling is prohibited. “Before, the trawlers weren’t in our zones, now they are,” Kargbo says. “The difference is so great [in terms of his catches] compared with before, I’m struggling to feed my children.” Others are being forced farther afield in search of fish. Ibrahim Bangura, 47, often goes on three-day fishing trips into the Atlantic, a deadly venture in the rainy season. But while the potential reward is greater, he says conflicts with Chinese trawlers are more likely. “There’s so, so many of them,” says Bangura. “They disturb my property, trash my nets. And if you try to stop them, they will fight you.” In addition to dominating licensed markets, China is consistently ranked as the worst offender for IUU fishing in a global index of 152 countries. Across west Africa, illegal trawling is devastating marine ecosystems and undermining local fisheries, which are a critical source of jobs and food security. A study in 2017 found that Sierra Leone, Senegal, Mauritania, the Gambia, Guinea-Bissau and Guinea lose $2.3bn (£1.7bn) a year due to IUU fishing, which amounts to 65% of the legal reported catch. Some experts warn that Sierra Leone’s coastal communities face devastating consequences of legal and illegal overfishing. “The Chinese fleet has been taking the profits of the fisheries for 30 years and the impact on fish stocks has been terrible,” says Stephen Akester, an adviser to Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources between 2009 and 2021. “The resources are disappearing, fishermen are suffering, families are starving. Many have just one meal a day.” “Imagine working for weeks and not being able to catch food,” says Woody Backie Koroma of the Sierra Leone Artisanal Fishermen Union. “They are getting debts. They go to bed without food.” Such is the strain, says Koroma, that one debt-ridden fisherman in Tombo killed himself last year after his boat was confiscated by the local authorities. Efforts to manage the sector, including the creation of an inshore exclusion zone that prohibits all but subsistence fishing in the six nautical miles closest to shore, installing movement trackers on industrial trawlers and creating community fishing associations to promote sustainability, have so far had limited impact due to policing and funding challenges, according to officials. A month-long ban on industrial fishing in 2019 was criticised as being too short to allow stocks to replenish. “We receive a lot of reports and intelligence of illegal fishing,” says Abbas Kamara, an officer at Tombo’s fisheries ministry. “But it’s difficult to corroborate. The trawlers work day and night. “Fish is very important to Tombo – it’s how people survive – but the fish go to the Chinese,” says Kamara. The Chinese embassy in Freetown did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment. Amara Kalone, at the Environmental Justice Foundation, a charity that monitored foreign vessels in Sierra Leone until last year when funding for the project ran out, says fleets are adapting their tactics to evade restrictions brought against industrial fishing. “Semi-industrial ships are coming closer to the estuaries, and they are in a legal grey area,” he says. “Other crews are using very fine, monofilament nets, which are illegal but hard to track.” Another major concern is the rise of marauding fishing crews from neighbouring countries such as Guinea and Liberia, which catch juvenile fish in protected breeding grounds, fatally undermining fish populations, according to Salieu Sankoh, coordinator of the West Africa Regional Fisheries Programme in Sierra Leone. “It’s a serious threat to the nutrition of the population,” he says. “Some local boats go to the sea and come back with nothing.” In Tombo, as the sky turns orange over Sierra Leone’s Western Peninsula and the ocean becomes unusually still, a sense of despair sets in for the many artisanal fishers struggling to stay afloat. Low hauls mean that Ali Mamy Koroma, a 40-year-old fisherman with two wives and six children, has had to borrow 1m leone (£65) to pay his bills. “I feel like I’m drowning,” says Koroma, slumped against the wall at the back of Tombo’s indoor market. “But I can’t swim. There is no way out.”  In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

2/1/2022,"A Gold Coast doctor has been subjected to death threats and abuse and is living in “utter fear” of anti-vaxxers after false reports two children died in his clinic after being administered the Pfizer vaccine. Police have been notified after Pacific Pines GP, Dr Wilson Chin, said “widespread panic” swept through his community after false reports spread online that two children had died in his clinic after being administered the Pfizer vaccine.  The girls suffered what Chin described as a “normal” fainting episode while under observation at the clinic a fortnight ago and have since recovered. But a post to a Facebook page purporting to be a “personal eyewitness account” wrongly claimed the girls had suffered “violent convulsions” and later died in the waiting room. Another Facebook user posted false information describing the girls as “unresponsive when ambos got there” and encouraging others to share the post. The backlash ultimately forced the clinic to pull out of the vaccine rollout of five to 11-year-olds after Chin and his colleagues received death threats. Five to 11-year-olds joined the rollout on 10 January after vigorous TGA approval. As of 28 January, 35.98% of the national age bracket had received at least one dose of a vaccine. In Queensland, though, the figure was 31.39%, trailing behind every state and territory except Western Australia. The Queensland government has cited misinformation as a key reason for lagging vaccination rates and vaccine hesitancy in some areas. In a lengthy Facebook post written after the misinformation spread, Chin said the “abuse and utter fear” he had faced via the practice’s phone and social media pages was “unbelievable”. In one instance, a social media user urged for dogs to be set on staff, while another person encouraged residents to “get” Chin after work, labelling him a “murderer”. “I have never seen anything like this before and it seemed never ending,” he wrote. “They did this without attempting to confirm the facts and whether these deaths were real.” Chin told Guardian Australia it was the “first time in his life” he’d questioned whether he was safe as a practising health worker. “I am concerned … we’re just trying to keep people safe and follow the guidelines and when things like this happen, there hasn’t been any government support, nothing’s been done,” he said. “There are a lot of people against the vaccine willing to do anything to jeopardise it, and we have no backup.” Chin said he was still receiving multiple threatening messages daily, including a death threat sent to his personal Instagram account advising him to hire security and watch his back. “Our address has been given to the public, and we have no security here. Every time I finish work I look around the car park to make sure nobody is following me.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Chin has cut down on his working hours and entered counselling since the abuse began. “We are just doing our jobs – we just want to care for our patients … I’m on the last thread here,” he said. Dr Karen Price, president of the RACGP, said Meta and other social media companies needed to do more to counter the spread of Covid-19 misinformation. “A GP receiving death threats simply for doing his job trying to keep his community safe is completely unacceptable and I won’t stand for it,” she said. “Dr Chin had to stay at a friend’s place because he was so concerned for his safety and there have been sleepless nights for fellow GPs, the practice manager and the other members of the practice team.” The RACGP has previously urged social media companies – including Twitter and Facebook – to take better accountability for anti-vaxxer content on their platforms. Price said a nearby practice which hadn’t offered Covid-19 vaccines to children had also received death threats. “Meta has a real opportunity here to walk the walk and back up their rhetoric by removing anti-vaxxers from the platform and making a concerted effort to counter anti-vaxxer misinformation and threats, including in private Facebook groups,” she said. “We cannot allow people like Dr Chin to experience threats, abuse and intimidation simply for doing his job.” Police were investigating the allegations and had tracked down one person who had made a direct threat against Chin, but no charges had been laid. GP and chair of RACGP Queensland Bruce Willett said Chin’s experience was an “extreme example of a widespread problem”. “Social media is fuelling this and social media companies need to step up and take some responsibility … particularly the extreme degree of misinformation that is essentially inciting hatred and potentially violence,” he said. “GPs have been under an enormous amount of pressure … the responsibility for Covid care has fallen back on general practice for mild and moderate cases, at the same time GPs have provided vaccinations and tried to do business as usual.” Willett said adding a “small, but very loud” group of people opposed to vaccinations attempting to “start a fight” to the mix was only increasing the burden on healthcare workers. A Meta spokesperson said it was “investigating” Chin’s profile and any content that breached its rules would be removed. “In addition to our policies on Covid-19, we do not allow death threats, hate speech or bullying and harassment on our apps and we’ll remove this content and work with law enforcement where there’s a credible risk of offline harm,” a spokesperson said.",News/Australia news,‘Utter fear’: Gold Coast GP receives death threats from ‘anti-vaxxers’ after false claim of child vaccine deaths,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/01/utter-fear-gold-coast-gp-receives-death-threats-from-anti-vaxxers-after-false-claim-of-child-vaccine-deaths
2/1/2022,"Deep down, everyone wishes they were Marvel. Armed with nothing but B-grade IP and heroic levels of pluck, a lowly comic book company slowly went about wrestling the film industry into an inescapable stranglehold. But a decade and a half on, Marvel has become the established order. It is time for a new plucky upstart to stage another revolution. That upstart? Mattel. You know, Mattel. The toy people. No, really.  This weekend, Mattel Films VP Robbie Brenner gave an interview to Variety, during which she laid out her ambitious plans for cinematic domination. Brenner, who in 2013 produced Dallas Buyers Club, unveiled a slate of films that is staggering in its ambition and amassed talent. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling have signed on to star in a Barbie movie directed by Greta Gerwig, working from a script she co-wrote with Noah Baumbach. Lena Dunham is writing and directing a Polly Pocket movie starring Lily Collins. Akiva Goldsman is writing a Major Matt Mason film that will star Tom Hanks. Now, unless I am mistaken, the people named in this paragraph have between them won three Oscars (and been nominated for another 14) and seven Emmys (and been nominated for a further 15). And they’re making films about toys. There’s also going to be a He-Man film, a Hot Wheels film, a Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots film, a Big Jim film, a horror franchise based on Magic 8 Ball and films based on Chatty Cathy and Betsy Wetsy. Three years from now we will all find ourselves drowning in Mattel films. Isn’t this incredible? Thanks in part to Marvel packing out the multiplexes with endless superhero blockbusters, there is no longer a commercial market for theatrically released mid-budget fare. And the people who made those films – the Oscar fare, the romcoms, the beloved indie classics – have found themselves without a home. Until now, these people ultimately had two options: either lash themselves to the deep pockets of the streamers, or bite the bullet and enter the world of television. Both choices, in one way or another, represent a compromising of ideals. But now Mattel, glorious Mattel, has ridden to the rescue with a beautiful third way. “Hey Gerwig! Hey Dunham! Hey Baumbach and Hanks!”, it has said. “Here is a budget you never thought imaginable, and free rein to make exactly the sort of film you have always dreamed of making!” True, they’re working under a contract stipulating that whatever they produce has to be a transparently cynical attempt to synergise the world’s greatest art form into toy sales, but beggars can’t exactly be choosers. It’s easy to sneer, of course. But then again, people sneered at Marvel 15 years ago. Who would watch a film about a no-mark superhero like Iron Man, they thought. Who would possibly watch something as grotesquely jingoistic as a post-Iraq Captain America movie? Or Ant-Man, or a film about a talking tree monster? The same could be said for Mattel. Watching a Polly Pocket film genuinely sounds like the worst afternoon of anyone’s life. But it could end up being Star Wars for all we know. It could end up being Citizen Kane. Mattel might just be ushering in a whole new epoch of cinema. This is just the start. Once these Mattel films become enormous blockbusters, who knows what will be next. Mattel has an impressively deep well of properties to draw from, so the sky’s the limit. We might soon see a Street Sharks movie. A Princess Mommy movie. A Merry Cherry Muffin movie. Perhaps, if we all close our eyes and wish, we’re only a few years from hearing the words “the Oscar for best picture goes to Pooparoos” spoken out loud in an auditorium of glamorous A-listers. Of course, any idiot can simply license their intellectual property to Hollywood. If Mattel is really serious about becoming the next Marvel, it needs to step up a notch. It needs to create a whole extended universe. Imagine how incredible it would be if Mattel could persuade an auteur like, say, Paul Thomas Anderson to make He-Man: When Barbie Comes to Town. Or Alejandro G Iñárritu to make Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots v Thomas the Tank Engine. At this rate it can only be a matter of time before the ghost of Stanley Kubrick is hired to make Chatty Cathy in Flushin’ Frenzy: Diarrhoea Smackdown. This is the future of cinema, and the quicker we all accept this the better.

2/1/2022,"One bright afternoon not long ago, Wendy Mitchell saw her father in her garden. She was inside with a mug of tea and he was standing on the lawn in his baggy green cardigan, smiling at her. She saw the yellow of his nicotine-stained fingers and the shine of his black, Brylcreemed hair. They stared at each other, happy to be together again. Then, in the blink of an eye, he was gone and the sunlit lawn was empty. Her father had been dead for more than 20 years and the sighting of him through the glass door was simply one of the many visual hallucinations that ambush Mitchell: the escalator turns into a waterfall; a marble floor is a swimming pool; a patterned carpet writhes with creatures; a person dressed in black becomes a disembodied head floating on air. Seeing her dead father could have been scary, confusing or painfully distressing, but instead Mitchell accepted the trick that dementia was playing on her as a gift, a moment of grace.  What I Wish People Knew About Dementia is chock-full of such optimistic reversals, in which something that most of us would experience as upsetting or frustrating is turned towards the light: a problem has a solution, a loss can bring unexpected gains, the diagnosis of dementia does not need to be a death sentence, but can instead herald the start of a whole new adventure in being human. Like her bestselling account of living with dementia, Somebody I Used to Know, this is a book whose purpose is to convert despair into hope. People with dementia (and people who live with and care for them) know that much of the suffering and havoc that the illness can bring comes not from the condition itself, but from the way the world treats people who live with it. Mitchell learned this the hard way: her life, and her sense of who she was in that life, was demolished when she first got the diagnosis of early onset dementia and it took her many years to work out strategies that enabled her to “live well with dementia” (though she dislikes that phrase for its implication that some people fail to live well). Her book, which she wrote with the help of Anna Wharton and which includes the comments of friends who also live with dementia, is a compilation of these strategies: a kind of how-to manual for people with the condition and those who support them. It proceeds by a practical and calming formula: take a difficulty and find a way to overcome it. The book is divided into six sections – Senses, Relationships, Communication, Environment, Emotion and Attitude – with each section subdivided into easily assimilable packages of guidance. Writing things down, not worrying about getting lost (a “walker” becomes a “wanderer”), buying shoes without laces or a cordless vacuum cleaner, turning a space into a memory room, finding other people with dementia to talk to, refusing to let her two adored daughters become her carers, understanding that “behavioural problems” are actually expressions of the desire to be understood and “challenging behaviour” a symptom of unmet needs, taking joy in the moment, meditating, finding the right apps, acknowledging confusion, recognising that dementia is a neurological condition… Running under all the commonsense pieces of advice is a deeper and more existential message, one for all of us, young and old, in health or frailty: be kind, be attentive, be resilient, bend with change rather than be broken by it, connect, forgive, accept, embrace. Live. Like Somebody I Used to Know, this is a book of hope. But there is a sense of intense labour, struggle and pain behind Mitchell’s pieces of advice and consolation. I can’t begin to imagine the how hard she has to work to be the Wendy Mitchell she has forged out of her illness – the one who has become a beacon of hope for thousands of people who live with dementia, who seeks joy in small things, takes adventures where she finds them, is open to her own vulnerability and humorous in the face of implacable decline (laughter is her best medicine). Yet she says that, in spite of the “haze” in her brain, in spite of the effort and weariness, in spite of times of confusion and distress, in spite of knowing she is edging towards the darkness, in spite of all she has lost and continues to lose, she is in many ways happier now than she has ever been, liberated from the shyer, more self-conscious and timid self of that somebody she used to know. I interviewed Mitchell when her first book came out and have met her several times since (she can never remember me, as she delightedly tells me each time): a small woman, grey-haired and smiling, who wears bright clothes and walks with a lopsided gait. She reminds me of a frail boat in a storm, battered and tossed about but still afloat and forging into the unknown, ripped sails unfurled. In the final pages of What I Wish People Knew About Dementia, when she recounts her experience of skydiving for charity, she draws on this sense of openness and joy. Strapped to a giant of a man dressed in pink, she plummets towards the ground smiling wider than she had ever smiled before: “Up here, there is no dementia… I am flying, free from all that binds me to the earth.” And why, she wonders when she is once more on solid ground, should the adventures ever end? She is a gallant soul.  What I Wish People Knew About Dementia, From Someone Who Knows by Wendy Mitchell (with Anna Wharton) is published by Bloomsbury (£14.99).

2/1/2022,"Sometimes Ambridge reminds me of The Village, that splendidly implausible M Night Shyamalan film about a 19th-century community in Pennsylvania. The village’s secret is that beyond a supposedly monster-infested forest, there is an actual 21st-century world with cars and telly. But hardly anyone knows about it and no one dares go there. In fact the entire village has been set up as a mad kind of social experiment. So it is in Borsetshire. The “powerful hold Ambridge can have” over its inhabitants was the subject of rumination by young Phoebe this month. (Will the penny drop? Will she realise that Nottingham, Birmingham, and even, dammit, London are places rather than idle dreams? Will she remember that she too once tasted freedom, at Oxford?)  Later she and Alice, chatting on the phone, found that they were both “shovelling muck” (Radio 4 being too genteel, unlike the Guardian, to shovel shit). Alice was clearing out Shula’s no-doubt Augean stables; Phoebe was doing something unmentionable with the rewilding project’s composting loos. Along with Lily, who is bored to death with her job selling kitchens, the trio – Phoebe the Oxford alum, Lily the Manchester University dropout, and Alice the aeronautical engineering graduate – got round, and not before time, to lamenting the fact that The Village conspires to keep them in a state of perpetual underachievement. Still, Lily is proposing to do a degree in estate management at Felpersham Uni – which suggests interesting times ahead vis-a-vis her twin brother, the feckless but charming son and heir to the family stately home, Lower Loxley. Hazel Woolley, one of the few characters not bound by Ambridge’s invisible force field, declared the village, with some justice, to be “a parochial, self-satisfied, two-bit place”, before flouncing out of Borsetshire, having evicted Tom and Natasha from the flat above the shop, which she owns (I always imagine her with a massive fur coat and cigarette holder, like Cruella de Vil). Housing in Ambridge is a bit like one of the Valentine’s Day nights that Kenton and Jolene are trying to devise for the Bull – a sort of large-scale musical chairs, with never quite enough accommodation to go around when the music stops. Tom and pregnant Natasha have moved in with Tony and Pat, who are being quietly sent demented; Chris and baby Martha are moving into the flat above the shop, which might leave Alice and Chris’s old cottage, the Nest, free; Pip and Josh are squabbling over the bungalow, currently inhabited by Rex Fairbrother; and Emma and Ed are still languishing in a static caravan.

2/1/2022,"Holiday bookings are experiencing a surge ahead of Covid travel tests being scrapped, making it a real possibility to go abroad without having to take a single test this February half-term. Last month the UK government scrapped pre-departure tests, along with the need for travellers to self-isolate on arrival until they receive a negative PCR test result. With the requirement for the day two test also being dropped from 11 February, test-free holidays for fully vaccinated Britons will soon, finally, be possible again.  On the Beach has predicted the biggest wave of holiday bookings the travel industry has seen in the past two years, with holiday sales already 150% up week on week since the start of the year. Zoe Harris, chief customer officer at On the Beach, said: “The scrapping of test requirements will give people the peace of mind they need to book with confidence, and that extra nudge to escape the cold and grey at home in favour of a sun lounger with their name on it.” There are 37 countries that are welcoming visitors without the requirement to take a test, but travel-testing regulations change often, so check the rules for your designated country before departure.

2/1/2022,"In 2013, the subreddit r/antiwork was born. “Unemployment for all, not just the rich!” read its tagline.  America was experiencing a mood change at that time. Occupy: The Movie had just hit theaters, lodging the eponymous movement in the national consciousness; the Socialist Alternative Party had just won its first ever seat on Seattle’s City Council; and Senator Bernie Sanders, the longtime independent from Vermont and self-described “democratic-socialist” was considering a presidential run. Born of the moment, r/antiwork offered a space where people could envision a life free from work – or at least, too much of it. Anchored by Marxist philosophy, the subreddit experienced modest growth over the years as people used it to commiserate, share memes and trade war stories about the horrors of modern day working in America. Then the pandemic hit, laying bare inequities long faced by lower-wage workers, particularly in the United States. The subreddit exploded. Screenshots of resignation texts to bosses went viral – “Eat. My. Ass.” read one memorable text, in response to a boss who had warned against such an “impulsive decision” – and in December, users bombarded a Kellogg’s application site that had been launched to replace 1,400 striking users with fake applications. As media reported on the “Great Resignation” in the wake of the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ report that 4.5 million Americans left their jobs in November 2021, an all-time high, r/antiwork inched closer to the mainstream. By the time Doreen Ford, the subreddit’s longest-tenured moderator, flicked on her webcam last Tuesday for what would be the group’s most public exposure yet – an interview with Fox News’ Jesse Watters, whose eponymous primetime show debuted with 3.8 million viewers the previous evening – the subreddit had reached 1.7 million members, good enough for one of the most popular on Reddit but less than half of Watters’ audience. The stage was set for some classic schoolyard bullying. On one side was r/antiwork, a community that functioned as a living, breathing – and growing – counterpoint to capitalism. On the other was Fox News, a right-wing media juggernaut with the mission of selling the working class on the sanctity of the American dream, and an institution directly threatened by movements like r/antiwork. It took Watters three minutes, twenty-three seconds to paint Ford as a clumsy caricature – and send r/anti-work into an existential crisis. “Alright, so Doreen,” Watters said, kicking off the interview, “why do you like the idea of being home, not working, but still getting paid by corporate America?” The 43-year-old Watters, a rising star on Fox who has praised QAnon and urged supporters to ambush Dr Anthony Fauci remained in split screen opposite Ford, who spoke into her fuzzy webcam from a dimly lit, messy room with an unmade bed. Ford, whose unkempt hair was matted to her forehead, later said in a Reddit comment she had trouble focusing on the camera because she’s autistic. Watters’ face became an instrument of mockery as Ford answered his questions, his eyes bulging in bemusement. When Ford, who said she works 20-25 hours per week as a dog-walker, said she’d like to one day be a philosophy professor, Watters let the subtle smile on his lips turn into a chuckle. “You know what, a professor’s a very similar schedule than something you are … imagining,” responded Watters. There is much debate over how many hours professors work, with schedules varying from college to college, although studies and individual professors put it somewhere between 40 to 70 hours per week. Watters quickly noted he didn’t think the antiwork movement was the best idea, but “it’s a free country. Not everything is free, but it’s a free country”. He snuck in one final shot as he ended the segment, speaking over Ford: “Thank you so much, we’ve got to run. We’ve got to pay the bills.” The interview sent r/antiwork into a tailspin. Not only was the subreddit overrun by bad actors from less sympathetic corners of the internet after the interview; longtime users expressed frustration and rage at the interview. Ford, who at one point during the segment referred to laziness as a “virtue”, had set the movement back, they believed, by being made to look like the worst stereotype of r/antiwork. (“I think laziness is a virtue in a society where people constantly want you to be productive, 24/7. And it’s good to have rest. That doesn’t mean you should be resting all the time, or not putting effort into things that you care about,” Ford had said, in a response to Watters asking her whether the group was encouraging people to be lazy.) “That interview was so embarrassing,” one user wrote, “it made me go back to work.” Others called for Ford’s demotion as a moderator, or to have her banned from the group. The subreddit went private the following night, and when it reopened the next morning Ford had been removed as a moderator. Users demanded a short-term freeze on media interviews, and not long after I requested to chat with the moderators, I received a notification that my reddit account had been permanently suspended. Another subreddit, r/workreform, was created and by Saturday afternoon had 458,000 users. Watters did a victory lap later in the week, updating his viewers on Ford’s removal as moderator on Thursday. “I’m sorry to see that Doreen is no longer doing that and I guess, maybe, she now has more time on her hands,” he said, shrugging. “That’s what she wanted.” Before r/antiwork had become a target of conservative news – the New York Post published a 17 January piece on the movement, accusing the subreddit of fueling the Great Resgination – it was a place for people fed up with a system that they believe perpetuates financial inequality. They used it to trade tips and tricks for navigating unruly bosses; or to share lighthearted stories. In early January, a thread from an IT specialist who claimed to have written a script that automated most of his job read: “I’m only at my desk maybe 10 minutes a day,” it went viral, inspiring people to unbind themselves from work and earning 83,800 upvotes. The subreddit’s library offered recommended reading (The Abolition of Work by Bob Black; In Praise of Idleness, by Bertrand Russell), music (Every Day is Exactly the Same by Nine Inch Nails). But while the subredditor’s trading of inspirational quotes and canvassing support for unionization efforts was threatening enough to warrant an investigation it to its motives by a huge conglomerate like Fox, anti-work members seemed mostly to be having fun: lambasting the worst parts of work, while mostly working full time jobs (an internal survey run through the subreddit last month found 64% of its users work full time). On a thread asking anti-workers for their favorite quotes, one posted a line from Charles Bukowski: “It was true that I didn’t have much ambition, but there ought to be a place for people without ambition … How in the hell could a man enjoy being awakened at 6.30am by an alarm clock … fight[ing] traffic to get to a place where essentially you made lots of money for somebody else and were asked to be grateful for the opportunity to do so?” it read. Meanwhile, where other subreddits refer to their members as “users,” on antiwork, members are proudly labelled ‘idlers.’ If r/antiwork were to fold, as many users suggested to avoid further embarrassment, it would not take with it the ideas it had helped to elevate over the past near-decade. But it would mark the end of a community that, for nearly two million people, had provided a place to vent and map out more fulfilling lives. By the weekend, the infighting on r/antiwork had mostly abated, with new posts taking on a familiar tone: “An Amazon warehouse in Staten Island is having a Union election! Show some support if you can!” read one post. “My boss just said ‘only mediocre people care for work life balance,’” read another. But the pinned post, “Restructuring & Recent Events [Megathread], in which a new moderator attempted to lower the temperature, pointed to the uncertain future facing the subreddit “Hello chaos,” the moderator wrote. “This thread is to address the many concerns raised in (the) wake of the Fox interview … We’re all reaching for a world free of the horror of ‘work as we know it’ – let’s continue that and not tear ourselves apart because of a few misinformed actors,” it read. The post had more than 7,600 comments, including one from a user named “Smokiiz” that earned 995 upvotes. Now, they realized, many outsiders associated r/antiwork with Watters’ smirking face, Smokiiz wrote: “My mom literally asked me if I’m on the ‘lazy movement’ that was on the news the other day,” they wrote. “I feel so ashamed.”",Global,"Like a bully in the school yard, Fox News sets its sights on the anti-work movement",https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/jan/31/fox-news-jesse-watters-antiwork-subreddit-interview
2/1/2022,"It was a low point even for GB News, a rolling-opinions TV channel with no documented highs: to celebrate the anniversary of Churchill’s funeral, it interviewed a Churchill impersonator as if he were Churchill. “Why do you think there is still so much admiration for you?”, the man – his name lost to the viewers, unfortunately, since the strapline underneath read simply “Winston Churchill, former prime minister” – was asked. “I think probably because I was the right man at the right moment,” he replied, having made the baffling decision to stick with the first person while consigning himself to the past. “I don’t think I could survive in the current climate,” he continued, presumably because the woke warriors would come for him. Too right we would. “You’re dead,” we would say, “and yet still talking. For this gross unnatural act, you are hereby no-platformed, nay, cancelled.” Some time in the early 2000s, a survey found Churchill to be the Briton most admired by his compatriots, and that was interpreted – some would say overinterpreted – as a lesson on what kind of prime minister we all secretly wanted. Did we like him best for his lofty rhetoric or his white supremacism? For his salty remarks at parties, or his “I, too, am human” physique? It was none of those things, of course. People liked him because he won things. Not all of them – he lost the odd election. But the important things, he won. Well, one important thing, but to give him credit, it was pretty damn important.  The salient thing now is not so much Churchill himself, who is – one more time for the GB viewers at the back – very much still dead, but what British politicians are trying to invoke when they wang on about him. The prime minister has written a book about his hero, but, even if you were prepared to read it, you would struggle to find the Churchillian value that Johnson most seeks to emulate. This is because it isn’t anything intrinsic to the man himself but rather the nature of his legacy: to Winston-stans, nothing matters, nothing he said or did, no mistake or omission, besides that one thing that he won. Imagine how relaxing it would be for a chaos monkey or a seat-of-pants merchant to live that creed: don’t sweat the small stuff, just choose one huge thing, and say you won it.

2/1/2022,"In May 2017 we spent £1,374 on what was supposed to be an extremely well-made inflatable tent – a Hornet 6SA by Outwell – with a view to keeping it until our children were grown up. But, when we arrived at our Dorset campsite last summer, the tent would not go up because the inflatable poles were perished and leaking. After spending several hours on hold to Outwell in Denmark we were forced to buy a £380 replacement in nearby Poole. Since then, I have been trying to resolve this with Outwell. It has told me that it no longer stocks replacement poles, and because of Brexit it can’t collect the tent. Its only solution is to offer to sell us a new one at a discount.  I am upset about the money wasted – and hardly need a third tent – but I’m much more upset about the lack of concern about what we should do with the non-functioning one. It is huge, weighing more than 40kg, and the idea of sending it to landfill is awful. We only used it four times – our previous one lasted 25 years. SA, Lancaster Most people would expect a £1,374 tent to last more than four trips. Outwell, while it was very sorry, hasn’t really come up with a solution. It tells me it had tried to source replacement tubes but had failed. It has offered a 65% discount on a new tent – the same, it claims, as it would have cost to replace the tubes. It again blamed post-Brexit customs problems for being unable to collect your tent. I spoke to the inflatable tents expert at Attwoolls Outdoors, near Gloucester, who, amazingly, knew your (early) model. He said that Outwell had since changed the design of the tubes and thought it unlikely you would find replacements, or that the universal pipes that now exist would fit. The retailer you bought the tent from is responsible under the Consumer Rights Act but I suspect you won’t get a better offer than the 65% discount if you go to court. I’d be trying to find an ingenious local person who may be able to fix it. Can anyone suggest somebody who can? We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

2/1/2022,"Scott Morrison has been blindsided by a claim that leaked texts between a party colleague and the former NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian included her calling the prime minister a “horrible person” who was untrustworthy. Morrison on Tuesday was confronted at the National Press Club by the Network Ten political editor, Peter van Onselen, who claimed he had been leaked text messages between “a current Liberal cabinet minister” and Berejiklian.  “In one, she described you as a horrible, horrible person, going on to say she did not trust you, and you are more concerned with politics than people,” Van Onselen said. “The minister is even more scathing, describing you as a fraud and ‘a complete psycho’. Does this exchange surprise you? And what does it tell us?” Van Onselen did not specify whether it was a state or federal minister. In response, Morrison said: “Well, I don’t know who you’re referring to, or the basis of what you’ve put to me. But I obviously don’t agree with it. And I don’t think that that is my record.” In a later news report on Tuesday night, Van Onselen claimed that in another text, sent during the 2019-20 bushfires, Berejiklian said: “Lives are at stake today and he [Morrison] is just obsessed with petty political point-scoring.” In a statement, Berejiklian said she had “no recollection of such messages”. “I understand there has been some commentary today concerning myself and the PM. I have no recollection of such messages,” she said. “Let me reiterate my very strong support for prime minister Morrison and all he is doing for our nation during these very challenging times. I also strongly believe he is the best person to lead our nation for years to come.” Late last year, Morrison urged Berejiklian to contest the federal seat of Warringah for the Liberal party, describing her as “a dear friend over a long period of time”. Berejiklian, who ultimately ruled out running, said she had considered the tilt because of her “respect” for Morrison and the Liberal party. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In Tuesday’s pre-election scene-setting address to the press club, Morrison sought to draw a line under a turbulent summer for the Coalition by conceding the government’s response to the pandemic was “not perfect” while seeking to switch the focus to the economic recovery ahead. But Morrison’s announcements for $800 in bonus payments to aged care workers and a new $2.2bn manufacturing strategy were overshadowed by a series of questions to the prime minister about his poor personal standing and the failure of the government to properly prepare for the Omicron outbreak. The prime minister was also asked whether he knew the cost of a “loaf of bread, a litre of petrol and a rapid antigen test” in a question suggesting he may have lost touch with ordinary Australians. “I am not going to pretend to you that I go out each day and I buy a loaf of bread and I buy a litre of milk. I’m not going to pretend to you that I do that,” Morrison replied. The prime minister, who is lagging in the polls and faces an uphill battle to secure the government’s re-election after three consecutive terms in office, said he did not believe the election would be about the Coalition’s performance. “It’s not a referendum on the government, this is a choice about who is going to lead the government after the election and there are two choices, and they will be able to see the differences between those two choices and to weigh up the consequences of those two choices – and they will carefully consider it,” Morrison said. “Australians, you know, in between elections, they tend not to focus that much on politics because they are focused on what matters most to them, not the political goings-on in this place. “But the time for the election will come, and when it does they will weigh these things up, and quietly get about their business.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app After using his opening address to “acknowledge” the frustrations felt by Australians during the pandemic, Morrison said he had reflected on what more the government could have done. “That leads you to ask: ‘Couldn’t you have done more? Couldn’t this have been avoided? After all, aren’t you responsible?’ I get that. For me, as prime minister, accepting this responsibility means asking yourself and challenging yourself every single day with those same questions. “But what I say to Australians on every occasion where something hasn’t gone exactly as we’d hoped or we’ve got it exactly right or the way we would have liked it to have turned out, we’ve crushed together, worked the program, solved it, and moved forward. “And that’s what Australians expect of us. I don’t think they expect perfection. But they do expect you to keep working it every single day. And that’s something I’m very proud my government has done.” Asked by the ABC’s Laura Tingle if he would like to apologise for perceived mistakes made as prime minister, including going to Hawaii during the 2019-20 bushfires, not securing enough rapid antigen tests, and shortcomings in the national disability insurance scheme, Morrison demurred. “We’re all terribly sorry for what this pandemic has done to the world and to this country,” he said. “These are the times in which we live. And I’ve set out today, I think, very clearly, the challenges that we’ve faced. But I’m also very proud of Australians and what they’ve achieved in enabling us all to come through this despite the setbacks and the challenges that we have faced.” Morrison said if he had his time over he would have better managed expectations about the risks of opening up over summer – saying the government had been “too optimistic”. “In raising those expectations about the summer, we heightened the great sense of disappointment that people felt.” The PM also said that he would have handed responsibility for the vaccine rollout to the military earlier last year. “I wish we had done that earlier – and that is a lesson.”",News/Australia news,Gladys Berejiklian called Scott Morrison a ‘horrible’ and untrustworthy person in leaked texts – report,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/01/gladys-berejiklian-called-scott-morrison-a-horrible-and-untrustworthy-person-in-leaked-texts-report
2/1/2022,"A pregnant New Zealand journalist who was stranded in Afghanistan after failing to secure a spot in her own country’s strict quarantine system has now been offered a place, the government has confirmed. The deputy prime minister Grant Robertson said the ministry for business, innovation and employment, which manages the quarantine system known as MIQ, has offered Charlotte Bellis an MIQ voucher.  “There is a place in MIQ for Miss Bellis, and I urge her to take it,” Robertson said. Bellis discovered she was pregnant a short time after gaining international attention in 2021 for questioning Taliban leaders about their treatment of women and girls. She is due to give birth in May. She resigned from Al Jazeera in November and had no choice but to leave Qatar, where she was usually based, because sex outside marriage is illegal. She and her partner, Jim Huylebroek, then moved to his native Belgium. In a column published in the New Zealand Herald on Saturday, Bellis wrote that she was unable to stay in Belgium because she was not a resident. She said the only other place the couple had visas to live was Afghanistan, where they are now located. In her column, she said she had been forced to turn to the Taliban for help before re-entering Afghanistan after her application for a place in New Zealand’s MIQ was rejected. She said she had since been attempting unsuccessfully to secure an emergency MIQ to give birth in New Zealand. New Zealand has managed to keep the spread of the coronavirus to a minimum during the pandemic and has reported 52 Covid deaths among its population of 5 million. But the requirement that even returning citizens spend 10 days isolating in quarantine hotels run by the military has led to a backlog of thousands of people vying for spots. Robertson said Covid-19 has meant many New Zealanders have been unable to return home for funerals, weddings and childbirth. “That’s incredibly tough. We’ve had our MIQ process in place for a very good reason - it has supported our public health response; it has avoided a number of deaths. But it doesn’t make it easy for people who are at the other end, wanting to come back to New Zealand.” The Guardian has contacted Bellis for comment.",News/World news,Pregnant New Zealand journalist Charlotte Bellis offered place in quarantine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/01/pregnant-new-zealand-journalist-charlotte-bellis-offered-place-in-quarantine
2/1/2022,"US authorities have banned disposable gloves from a manufacturer in Malaysia over allegations it uses forced labour, sending the share price of global protective equipment group Ansell into a tailspin. The customs and border protection unit of the US Department of Homeland Security said it had “information that reasonably indicates the use of forced labor in YTY Group’s manufacturing operations” and banned the importation of gloves made by the company.  CBP alleged workers at YTY, which is one of Ansell’s top five suppliers, experienced “abuse of vulnerability, deception, retention of identity documents, intimidation and threats, debt bondage, abusive working and living conditions, and excessive overtime”. Ansell’s share price plunged almost 15% when it revealed the US import ban, together with Covid outbreaks in its Malaysian factories, would cut its earnings for the first half of the year by as much as 35%. The ban, known as a “withhold release order”, followed a complaint from Nepal-based activist Andy Hall. He said it was the fourth made against an Ansell supplier out of the six orders CBP has made against Malaysian glove companies since 2019 and accused the Australian-listed company of failing to properly deal with a longstanding problem with allegations of forced labour in its supply chain. “They have a history of not remediating any of these issues, you know, they just go and they buy from another company,” he said. He said that in relation to a US ban on gloves from another supplier, Top Glove, “they didn’t even stop buying”. “They just started rerouting products to their European and Australian markets.” “They have a huge issue and to be honest, they’re one of the companies that I detest the most actually, because of their behaviour, and the way in which they fail to remediate things.” He said exploitation of overseas workers, who mainly come from Bangladesh and Nepal, was rife across the glove-making industry in Malaysia. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Some workers in the industry are charged large sums to come to Malaysia, have their passports kept by bosses so that they can’t leave, work excessive overtime that can result in seven-day work weeks and are exposed to violent reprisal if they complain, he said. “There’s been a lot of changes in the industry since I started campaigning in 2018, mostly because of the US sanctions and because of the media pressure,” he said. “So there’s slowly been improvements but the pandemic has really increased the workload and they haven’t been able to get new workers from overseas, so the workers are really working very long hours.” YTY’s chief executive, Vikram Hora, said the company had been working to improve the conditions of migrant workers since 2019, “given that they are at greater systemic risk for abuse or exploitation”. “Given the substantial and continuous progress YTY has made over the past three years, we are both surprised and disappointed with the enforcement action taken by the Department of Homeland Security, especially as this action was undertaken without any form of prior engagement with us,” he said. However, Hall said he told YTY about the CBP investigation. “I definitely think they’e been improving a lot, but whether or not they’ve solved these issues, I don’t know,” he said. An Ansell spokesperson said most of the companies hit by US bans “are minor suppliers to Ansell and two of the four (Top Glove and WRP) are now again exporting into the US with their respective WROs revoked by US Customs and Border Protection”. “Ansell clearly and publicly acknowledges the risks that modern slavery practices may be evident in our supply chain,” the spokesperson said. “Risks of human trafficking are driven in large part by our use of migrant labour and recruitment agents, particularly in our manufacturing plants in Malaysia and Thailand. Similarly, risks of forced labour in our operations are most likely to be present as debt bondage, driven by deceptive recruitment practices in the third-party hiring of migrant labour”. The spokesperson said that Ansell followed the advice of human rights groups and rather than walking away from suppliers with problems preferred to work with them “to drive positive change through ongoing dialogue and the audit process, where possible given the current pandemic conditions”. “However, when we identify suppliers who do not align with our labour standards commitment and who are not working in good faith to progress positive change in their labour standards compliance, we review our potential options, including finding alternate sources for our product and terminating the supplier relationship”. The CBP began investigating potential violations of labour standards at YTY in March last year after a complaint from Hall, documents he provided to Guardian Australia show. Announcing the ban, the secretary of homeland security, Alejandro N Mayorkas, said the US would “continue to leverage all of our authorities and resources to bar goods produced with forced labor from entering the United States, and with my designation earlier this week of a senior accountable official to prevent human trafficking in DHS contracts, we are leading efforts to ensure that no taxpayer dollars are ever used to purchase goods or services that rely on forced labour”.",News/Global development,US bans imports of disposable gloves from Ansell supplier in Malaysia over allegations of forced labour,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/01/us-bans-imports-of-disposable-gloves-from-ansell-supplier-in-malaysia-over-allegations-of-forced-labour
