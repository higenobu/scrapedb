2/22/2022,"By Maria Tsvetkova KYIV (Reuters) - Alisa, a 38-year-old Ukrainian with an office job in the capital, had always enjoyed sport shooting and joined a local territorial defence unit more than a year ago to acquire combat skills. Now she is worried she might have to use those skills in a real war with Russia. ""People die, that's horrible. Even worse is when you think not just about your life but about the life of a 7-year-old child,"" she said in an interview with Reuters in her house outside Kyiv while her son, Timur, watched cartoons. ""I realise he can be hurt because of silliness of the neighbouring country, not a brother country anymore,"" said Alisa, who asked to be identified only by her first name. Russia's build-up of tens of thousands of troops near the borders with Ukraine has stirred fears in Ukraine and Western countries that it is poised to invade, something Moscow denies. Alisa joined the territorial defence forces a year and a half ago, earlier than many. In January, as the Russian troops massed, the government said it wanted to build reserve batallions up into a corps of up to 130,000 people. Alisa said she has seen dozens of new people joining the training sessions each Saturday. She began this weekend as she often does, putting on camouflage fatigues, taking one of her two small-calibre guns she keeps at home and heading to a training ground - a pine forest with sand dunes, an old railway and few abandoned construction sites. Along with dozens of other volunteers, mostly men in their late 30s and 40s with civilian jobs, she then spent seven hours either with her weapon on the ground or on guard as a part of a small patrol tasked to protect a concrete building from enemy saboteurs. She said the fact she has at least basic training is some comfort. ""If, God forbid, a war starts ... I know how to move from an unsafe point A to a safe point B,"" Alisa said. ""I understand how to do if I'm under fire. I know how to help Timur, friends, neighbours if they are caught in fire."" EARLY STARTS Alisa, a motorcycle fan, has visited more 50 countries along with her husband, also a biker. She is a media relations specialist at an organization that works in cyber security. She tries not to skip training sessions herself even if she badly needs rest at the end of the working week. ""If we had peace time I would miss training if I was tired but now I make myself get up early for a session because now it's needed more than ever,"" she said. Alisa said she likes gaining new skills that have built her self-confidence and courage, but hopes never to have to use them. ""I feel anger, hatred and I have my plans cancelled. It's all surreal for me and I don't get how such silly things can happen in a civilized world in the 21st century,"" she said.

2/22/2022,"The city of Evansville was mentioned in a recent episode of ""The Joe Rogan Experience,"" and not for a good reason. On the Feb. 16 edition of his podcast, Rogan, who's been the subject of a few recent controversies regarding his stance on COVID-19 vaccines and his use of the N-word on several past podcast episodes, talked with Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist and professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University about a variety of topics on climate change. Evansville came up when the conversation veered to a discussion on air pollution caused by coal-fired power plants. The podcast averages 11 million listeners per episode. Neil Young vs. Joe Rogan: Spotify agrees to remove Neil Young's music following Joe Rogan vaccine misinformation complaint A little more than an hour into the podcast, Rogan asked his assistant, Jamie Vernon, to search the Internet for North American cities most polluted by coal. The search brought back Evansville at the top of the list. ""Evansville?"" Rogan asked. ""I know someone from Evansville."" Vernon noted that there were seven coal plants ""within 30 miles"" of the city, which prompted shocked replies from both Rogan and Dessler. ""Yeah, you don't want to live there,"" Dessler said. ""Holy shit, we need to see what that (Evansville) sky looks like,"" Rogan replied. Joe Rogan apologizes: For 'regretful,' 'shameful' use of racial slur after clips circulate The group watched an excerpt from The Center for Public Integrity's 12-minute video on coal pollution, ""America's Super Polluters,"" which opens with this statement on Evansville's air quality: ""Southwest Indiana has some of the worst air quality in the country,"" a man says at the beginning of the clip. ""The people are suffering there."" Dessler's appearance on the podcast came a week after Rogan hosted Steven Koonin, a physicist and former U.S. Department of Energy undersecretary of science during President Obama's administration, to talk about his views on climate change and why he doesn't believe ""the science is settled"" in regards to there being a climate emergency. Environmental activists have long described Southwest Indiana as a ""sacrifice zone"" where health takes a back seat to the coal industry. Improvements in air quality have been seen in recent decades as utilities added pollution controls to comply with changing federal air quality regulations. Controversy without cancelling: Joe Rogan. Whoopi. Awkwafina. Chappelle. None was canceled. Is this a new cultural detente? While the area no longer struggles to meet air quality standards as it once did, it still experiences occasional air quality alerts for ozone or fine particulate pollution. In 2020, coal fueled 53 percent of Indiana's electricity production compared to 19 percent nationally, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Indiana ranks third in the nation in total coal consumption and coal consumption for electricity generation, after Texas and Missouri. However, there has been some good news for Southwest Indiana residents. Indiana Michigan Power is working to close both its massive coal-fired generating units at Rockport, Indiana, in 2028. CenterPoint Energy is in the process of replacing its coal-burning A.B. Brown Power plant near Evansville with turbines that will burn somewhat cleaner natural gas, although that is still a fossil fuel that will produce carbon emissions.

2/22/2022,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — A Nebraska state senator called for a criminal investigation after one of her colleagues said he would resign after admitting that he took photos of a female legislative aide without her knowledge. Democratic state Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha sent a letter urging the state attorney general and Nebraska State Patrol to investigate the conduct of Republican Sen. Mike Groene to determine if he committed any crimes, according to the Omaha World-Herald. Groene told The Associated Press Friday that he planned to resign this week to avoid putting his family through a public ordeal. The conservative from North Platte who often disagreed with his Democratic colleagues in the Legislature also said he would withdraw from the race for the University of Nebraska Board of Regents and leave politics. Groene announced he would resign after an online news outlet, Nebraska Sunrise News, reported that one of his staffers had filed a complaint after she discovered the photos on Groene's laptop, which he had given her to complete a project. The staffer who was photographed, Kristina Konecko, told the World-Herald that one detail in the initial stories about her complaint was incorrect. She said that she didn't find any evidence that the photos had been sent to anyone else. But Konecko did say that some of the photos were close-ups of parts of her body with sexually suggestive captions. The Associated Press does not typically name victims of sexual harassment, but did so in this case because the newspaper said it published Konecko's name at her request. Groene said he took photos of the staffer, but he described them as harmless images of staffers, visitors and family members in his office. He also denied that any of them were sexual in nature or that focused on particular body parts. Konecko told the newspaper that she filed her complaint under the Legislature's workplace harassment policy in early February, and she has since transferred to another legislative office. She said no one ordered her not to discuss the issue, but she doesn't plan to answer additional questions about it now that it may be investigated. “I have not been advised or directed nor have I received any suggestions or recommendations from any outside sources, but because there has been a call for a formal investigation, I am not going to be answering any questions or sharing any further information,” she said. “However, I am very grateful and appreciative for the outpouring of support and encouragement that I have received from the public.” Groene said he apologized to the staffer after she confronted him about the photos a few weeks ago and believed the matter was over. A Nebraska State Patrol spokesperson told the newspaper it had received Hunt's letter and is talking with the Attorney General's office about it. A spokesperson for the Attorney General said his office will review the letter. Under the Legislature's policy, formal complaints about senators or staffers are filed with the Legislature’s Executive Board, but they’re not released to the public unless the committee finds serious misconduct. During his time in the Legislature Groene fought to lower property taxes and sometimes used abrasive language during floor debate. He also led the Legislature’s Education Committee for four years before his colleagues voted to replace him with a Democratic state senator.

2/22/2022,"A new study has reignited a debate over the role of vitamin D in mitigating severe COVID-19 symptoms as researchers suggest those with a deficiency may be more likely to develop serious illness. Leading infectious disease experts say that more in-depth research is needed to confirm whether vitamin D is directly associated with COVID-19 severity. Vitamin D cannot prevent COVID-19 transmission all on its own, and experts say its crucial to speak to a doctor before seeking out supplements, as large doses can be harmful to your health. In the report below, you'll learn: Is vitamin D actually beneficial against infections? And can Vitamin D alone prevent COVID-19? Vitamin D's role in the prevention of the spread of COVID-19 has been long contested by many experts since the pandemic began, fueled by early chatter of alternative treatment methods back in 2020. But a new piece of research has once again reignited the public's interest in these supplements, as scientists highlight a possible association between vitamin D levels and the immune system's ability to fend off severe COVID-19 symptoms, particularly associated with the Omicron variant. The small-scale study, which was organized by researchers in Israel and is based on data collected between April 2020 and February 2021, was recently published in PLOS ONE and presents a case that researchers say is ""equally relevant"" for Omicron spread as well. The data was collected from 253 people who were admitted to hospitals for treatment (at a time before vaccines were available) and was used to conclude that those who had a vitamin D deficiency were more likely to develop a severe or critical case of COVID-19, as compared to patients who had sufficient vitamin D levels within blood samples taken at the time of hospitalization. About half of those in the study were deficient in the vitamin. Further links found within the new study suggest that those who were lacking vitamin D were 14 times more likely to experience severe COVID-19 complications, which the National Institutes of Health (NIH) define as someone likely needing a respirator to breathe — and in severe cases, those who experience respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ dysfunction. Those with a vitamin D deficiency were significantly more likely to die due to infections, the study found; 25.6% mortality rate versus just 2.3% for those who weren't lacking vitamin D. As of February 14, 2022, 252.1 million people have received at least one dose of a #COVID19 vaccine. Of those, 214 million are fully vaccinated. More than 91.8 million people have received a COVID-19 booster dose. Find your COVID-19 vaccine: https://t.co/xbvNiaVJKV. pic.twitter.com/S2APwj03R3 — CDC (@CDCgov) February 14, 2022 Some may come to the conclusion that making sure you get sufficient levels of vitamin D can help keep your immune system in top shape, but other experts are keen to point out that this study doesn't prove that vitamin D alone can save you from severe infection. Paul Spearman, M.D., director of the division of infectious diseases at Cincinnati Children's Hospital, tells Good Housekeeping that more research is needed to confirm whether vitamin D levels will be an indicator of how severe symptoms will be for someone impacted by COVID-19. ""We have to remember that an association doesn't mean causation — meaning, that other things going on in [those people] with low vitamin D levels may cause severe disease, and not the low vitamin D itself,"" he explains, adding that a randomized, controlled, double-blind study of vitamin D supplementation before COVID-19 infection would be needed for concrete proof. ""This type of study is hard to do and requires enrolling a large number of patients."" Dr. Spearman adds that this isn't the first time that vitamin D has been considered in limited meta-analysis research to determine the role this nutrient plays in COVID-19 infections. Conflicting research suggests that low vitamin D levels don't ""aggravate"" COVID-19 risk or death, nor that upping vitamin D supplements in any given routine improves patients' health as they recover in the hospital, he says. A 2021 Nutrition Journal study concluded there wasn't an association between COVID-19 severity and vitamin D levels and a preprint of a study out of the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil suggests vitamin D supplements administered to hospitalized patients also didn't provide any recovery benefits. But vitamin D is far from useless, and while its role in preventing or stemming the severity of a COVID-19 infection is still uncertain, Dr. Spearman adds that there are theoretical reasons behind why immune systems may be impacted if someone isn't sufficiently getting enough vitamin D. Nutrition experts have long established that vitamin D is essential for optimal bone health (as it helps absorb calcium) and that the nutrient aids muscle function in addition to being linked to a few other key bodily functions. Vitamin D levels are influenced by nutrition, certainly, as it can be partially sourced from food — things like fatty salmon, beef liver, egg yolks and Swiss cheese all contain ample vitamin D — but is often sourced naturally just by being outside. ""The most well-known way to get your dose of vitamin D is exposing yourself to sunlight,"" says Stefani Sassos, MS, RD, CDN, a registered dietitian in the Good Housekeeping Institute, in an interview touting potential benefits of the supplement. But evidence for vitamin D's role in boosting immunity overall isn't as clear, Dr. Spearman explains. ""Vitamin D has been evaluated to help fight other respiratory infections — unfortunately, we don't have a clear answer here either, except that giving a single large dose isn't helpful at all,"" he says. ""Meta-analyses of this question have been inconclusive."" This new study may add more weight to burgeoning evidence that there may be an association of low vitamin D levels correlated with severe disease, COVID-19 included. But if there is an immune-boosting benefit to be had, ""it is with standard, low doses and not large doses,"" Dr. Spearman clarifies. Experts from across fields of study, including Spearman and Sassos, agree that vitamin D supplements should be a consideration primarily if your doctor has detected you have low vitamin D levels in treatment. If news of this study has you curious about your own vitamin D intake, make it a point to discuss it with your doctor — but you're likely to have sufficient vitamin D coursing through your veins. Only 5% of Americans suffer from a severe vitamin D deficiency, per the NIH, and 18% have been noted to have ""inadequate"" levels which may or may not cause issues associated with aches, cramps, or muscle development, Sassos adds. ""If someone is detected by their doctor as having low vitamin D levels, they should receive supplementation with medical guidance,"" Dr. Spearman advises. ""We should keep in mind that taking large doses of vitamin D is dangerous, and self-medicating can cause problems — including high blood calcium and kidney failure."" ""Whereas excess of water-soluble vitamins are rapidly excreted through urine, fat-soluble vitamins like vitamin D are stored in the body for long periods of time and can pose a higher risk for toxicity if consumed in excess,"" Sassos adds. Taking this study and conflicting research into account, and everything we know about how SARS-CoV-2 impacts both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, it's clear that vitamin D supplements alone cannot prevent COVID-19 transmission. Experts are continuing to examine how vitamin D may play a small role in lowering the risk of someone experiencing a severe sickness or dying after being infected. ""For a normal, healthy person, the role of a low-dose, ongoing supplement in preventing severe COVID-19 is not yet certain,"" Dr. Spearman says. The debate over vitamin D's role in helping bring an end to the pandemic is likely going to continue to be a topic of discussion, as experts are now conducting appropriately prospective, randomized and controlled studies of vitamin D supplementation. ""We hope to have a more definitive answer from these trials, which can provide a higher level of evidence,"" he adds. NEW: Study out of @CDCMMWR today notes the critical importance of staying up to date on CDC’s recommended #COVID19 vaccines. Boosters prevent serious COVID-19 illness. Get vaccinated + boosted. https://t.co/41Jk5FPsej — Rochelle Walensky, MD, MPH (@CDCDirector) February 1, 2022 Experts are agreed that the only role vitamin D may play in ending the pandemic may be partial and preventative in nature, versus an active solution after someone has become sick. ""Supplementing vitamin D may play a role in treating patients, but the data is relatively weak at this time,"" Stuart Cohen, M.D., chief of infectious diseases at UC Davis Health, shared in a recent communications report. ""It surely is not a way to treat COVID-19 in and of itself."" Talking to your doctor about vitamin D can be an effective way to make sure you're supporting your immune system with optimal nutrients across the board. It may also help you to consider that, in spite of discussion of alternative forms of prevention, current vaccines have demonstrated their effectiveness at preventing hospitalization and death stemming from COVID-19 infections. Getting enough vitamin D is a valid concern you should discuss with your doctor, especially if you are someone who may be disposed to inadequate or deficient levels of this essential nutrient. Experts have previously established that these at-risk individuals would benefit from discussing vitamin D supplements with a doctor: Adults over the age of 65 People with clinical obesity People diagnosed with liver disease, celiac disease, cystic fibrosis and/or Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis Those who experience limited sun exposure Those with dark skin tones Those enjoying a plant-based lifestyle Your healthcare provider can order a blood test to examine your vitamin D levels, Sassos adds, and can help you figure out which supplements work best for you at the appropriate dosage. ""Taking vitamin D under medical supervision for those who have measured vitamin D deficiencies is warranted,"" Dr. Spearman adds. ""[But] the best prevention of severe COVID-19 is certainly earned through vaccines, and the evidence here is undeniable.""

2/22/2022,"The U.S. has obtained intelligence that Russian officers have received orders to launch an invasion into Ukraine. CBS News national security correspondent David Martin confirmed the information during an appearance on Face the Nation Sunday. The intelligence suggests that Russian commanders are making military preparations and “doing everything that American commanders would do once they got the order to proceed,” Martin said. Earlier Sunday, both the State department and Pentagon said the U.S. was still pulling all the diplomatic stops to attempt to de-escalate the Russia-Ukraine crisis as an incursion becomes increasingly probable. Speaking on CNN’s State of the Union, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Russian president Vladimir Putin’s positioning of forces in Ukraine’s immediate geographical neighborhood indicted an impending incursion. “He’s followed the script almost to the letter,” he said. During a presentation before the United Nations Security Council Thursday, Blinken noted that the U.S. had expected Russia to manufacture a crisis that could serve as an pretext for intervention. Russia just extended drills with its approximately 30,000 troops in Belarus past Sunday, when joint military exercises were scheduled to end. On Sunday, the Belarusian defense minister cited growing tensions in eastern Ukraine as the reason “to continue the inspection of reaction forces.” As recently as last week, Russia had not planned to prolong its military presence in Belarus. “As we described it, everything leading up to the actual invasion appears to be taking place: all these false flag operations, all of these provocations to create justifications,” he said. Blinken said that the U.S. would try to negotiate with Russia up until the last minute, however. “We believe President Putin has made the decision, but until the tanks are actually rolling, and the planes are flying, we will use every opportunity and every minute we have to see if diplomacy can still dissuade President Putin from carrying this forward,” he added. “We will do everything we can to try to prevent it before it happens, but equally we’re prepared, if he does follow through, to impose massive consequences, to provide for Ukraine’s ongoing defense and to bolster NATO,” Blinken said. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Sunday the U.S. was running a “full-court press” to deter Putin, exhausting all negotiation avenues to convince him to change his mind. Responding to questions about why the U.S. has not imposed pre-emptive sanctions on Russia, Kirby noted that such action if used prematurely could provoke what they are trying to prevent. “If you punish somebody for something they haven’t done yet, then they might as well just go ahead and do it,” he said. On Friday, President Joe Biden told reporters he was confident Putin had made his decision and that invasion was imminent in the “coming days.” Vice President Kamala Harris backed up this belief Sunday.

China said it had to act after the latest deal undermined ""peace and stability"" in the region. It regards the island as a breakaway province that must accept Chinese sovereignty. Beijing has never renounced the possibility of using force to achieve that goal. Over the past two years it has stepped up military and diplomatic pressure on the island's government. Now the effects of the sanctions may be largely symbolic, as the U.S. does not sell arms to China.

2/22/2022,"An American au pair working in Paris said ""Emily in Paris"" gets some things right but a lot wrong. Ayana Smith told Insider the Netflix show uses stereotypes and a ""distorted image"" of the locals. She said a relatable aspect of the show is Emily's struggle with the French language. An Arizonian au pair who lives in Paris and makes TikTok videos about her career said ""Emily in Paris"" gets little right about living in the French capital. Ayana Smith, 23, who currently has over 40,000 followers on TikTok, said she started making videos in June, weeks before completing her degree in psychology and family services and becoming an au pair. She told Insider she got the job through the agency Rome Abroad, which placed her and gave her informal training. After three months in Italy from late June, she said she began working for a family in the suburbs of Paris in October 2021, who pays her €100, or around $114, a week for child-minding services. Aside from her monthly salary of €400, or around $455, which she said is low but ""1,000% worth it,"" the hosts cover her accommodation in their family home, home-cooked meals which she can eat with them or alone, her phone bill, and a Navigo travel pass for all forms of transport, she said. In a TikTok video shared on January 20, which has over 8,300 views at the time of reporting, Smith wrote: ""Everyone: Emily in Paris is so unrealistic, nobody actually lives like that,"" before showing a compilation of herself shopping, eating, and partying. The caption says: ""I'm lying but it's still a great time lol."" When asked if she really can relate to the Netflix character — a young social-media marketing professional portrayed by Lily Collins who unexpectedly moves from Chicago to Paris — Smith said there were some applicable moments but she thought it was broadly inaccurate. ""I definitely relate to Emily in the sense that I had never taken a French class before moving to Paris,"" she said, adding that she also struggled to grasp the ""difficult"" language, and understand French humor. Smith also said the show represents French people with ""the stereotypes that you typically hear about,"" such as being unfriendly or rude. ""I have met so many nice French people but in the show, you really don't get to see a lot of that,"" Smith said. ""I just think that it shows a really distorted image of Parisians."" In October 2020, when the first season appeared on Netflix, French people criticized the show for what they felt was a superficial depiction of their culture, as reported by 20 Minutes, a free daily newspaper in France. ""The berets. The croissants. The baguettes. The hostile waiters. The irascible concierges. The inveterate philanderers. The lovers and the mistresses. Name a cliche about France and the French, you'll find it in Emily in Paris,"" wrote Fabien Randanne, a culture journalist at 20 Minutes. Smith told Insider that the show acts out the ""fantasy"" of what moving to Europe is like, rather than the reality. ""Emily's life is the life that Americans dream of when they think of an American living in Paris,"" she said, adding that her experience has been quite different. Speaking to Cosmopolitan's Emma Baty in a story published in October 2020, Lucas Bravo, who plays Gabriel in the show, said he understands criticism that it offers a limited view of Paris, but that it couldn't possibly show everything. ""I think they're right, in a way. We're portraying cliches and we're portraying one single vision of Paris. Paris is one of the most diverse cities in the world,"" he told Baty, adding that it's home to many different nationalities and neighborhoods.

2/22/2022,"DUBAI (Reuters) -A U.S.-built F5 jet in use by the Iranian military crashed into the wall of a school in the northwestern city of Tabriz on Monday, killing the two pilots and a person on the ground, Iranian state TV reported on Monday. The school was closed at the time of the crash just before 9 a.m. (0530 GMT), army spokesman Shahin Taqi-Khani said. He said technical failure appeared to be the cause of the crash, but that an investigation was underway. The pilot and a trainee pilot were killed, as well as a civilian passing by in a car, he said. The TV showed fire fighters extinghising the blaze. Experts say Iran has a poor air safety record, with repeated crashes, many involving U.S.-built aircraft bought before the 1979 Islamic revolution. The United States, which broke diplomatic ties in 1980 after Iranian students took U.S. diplomats hostage, imposed sanctions on Iran making it difficult for Tehran to buy spare parts for its military and civilian aircraft.

2/22/2022,"Former President Donald Trump was so angry after his company’s longtime accounting firm severed ties that he apparently placed himself in more legal jeopardy with a reckless responding screed. A letter from accounting firm Mazars USA that said it was dropping the Trump Organization was included in a court document filed last week. It declared that 10 years of financial statements it had created with records provided by the Trump Organization should no longer be considered reliable. Trump blamed an ongoing investigation into him and his business by New York Attorney General Letitia James, whom he claimed “threatened” and “harassed” Mazars into the action. James is investigating whether Trump inflated asset values to obtain bank loans and entice investors, and reduced values to lower tax bills. Trump boasted Tuesday in his lengthy statement on Mazars about his knowledge of the Trump Organization’s financial statements — and about padding the value of some of his business properties in 2014 with an arbitrary 30% Trump brand premium. But that was just a day after his attorneys argued in court documents that Trump “denies knowledge” — and doesn’t even know enough “to form a belief” concerning just about every financial practice at his own company that may be scrutinized in James’ probe. James quickly fired off a letter to the judge presiding over her investigation about Trump’s statement, noting that it flatly contradicted claims by his own attorneys. “It is not unusual for parties to a legal proceeding to disagree about the facts,” James wrote to Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Arthur Engoron. “But it is truly rare for a party to publicly disagree with statements submitted by his own attorneys in a signed pleading — let alone one day after the pleading was filed. That is what Mr. Trump has done here.” Clearly, Trump knows “exactly what OAG is investigating,” she wrote, referencing the Office of the Attorney General. NEW!

(AP) — The owner of Lizard Lick Towing, a towing and repossession business featured in a reality TV show, has confirmed that his son was killed in a shooting in North Carolina. In a post on Facebook, Ronnie Shirley confirmed that Harley Shirley, 21, was fatally shot in Garner late Thursday. Shirley and his wife, Amy, own Lizard Lick Towing and starred in a truTV reality show based on their family business from 2011 to 2014. The shooting is being investigated by the Johnston County Sheriff’s Office. “He’s at peace now — waiting on the rest of us to arrive at those gates — we will be there soon Big Shur — and will always cherish the times we had while you were with us son,” Ronnie Shirley wrote on Facebook. The News & Observer reports that deputies responded to a reported shooting at a home around 8 p.m. Thursday. Capt. Jeff Caldwell said in a news release that soon after that, a caller reported people with gunshot wounds in the parking lot of a Sheetz gas station, about 3 miles (5 kilometers) north of the home. There, deputies found Shirley, who was pronounced dead at the scene. A 20-year-old woman who also had been shot was taken to the hospital, but her wounds were not thought to be life-threatening, Caldwell said. WRAL-TV reported the shooting happened while family members were holding a balloon release memorial for a relative who died in a single-car crash on Tuesday in Fuquay-Varina.

2/22/2022,"Finnish President Sauli Niinistö said Sunday that he's recently seen changes in Russian President Vladimir Putin's behavior, saying that he now sounds more ""decisive"" than in the past. Niinistö, who has been in close contact with Putin, recalled an exchange the two shared on the phone. During one of the regular calls, Niinistö said he pushed back against Putin by standing up for his country’s sovereignty. That is when Putin switched tones, he said, then began to “officially” read his list of demands. “That was a change in his behavior, and I want to guess, and from that I guess that he wants to be very decisive, wants to sound like one. It was a different kind of behavior,” he said during an interview on CNN’s ""State of the Union."" For decades, Finland has kept a delicate balance in its relationship with Russia, having been invaded by the Soviet Union in 1939. The country, which borders Russia, stayed scrupulously neutral throughout the Cold War, becoming neither part of the Warsaw Pact nor of NATO. That delicate balance, however, might be tipped if Russia were to invade Ukraine, which President Joe Biden and others throughout the West have painted as an imminent threat. While Niinistö emphasized his country wasn’t planning on a dramatic change in its relationship with Russia, he suggested Russia’s actions are making Finnish people rethink joining NATO. ""A lot depends, also, what actually happens in Ukraine and how Russia is going to behave after that,"" he said. ""If Russia sees a success story for them, that makes them more dangerous."" However, he emphasized that Finland doesn’t feel threatened by Russia as of now. “Finland is a stable democracy. We are a member of the European Union and part of the West,” he said. “We are not afraid of Russian tanks suddenly crossing the Finnish border.”

2/22/2022,"EXCLUSIVE: Explicit Los Angeles jailhouse recordings of Hannah Tubbs, the 26-year-old trans child molester who received a slap on the wrist last month after pleading guilty to molesting a 10-year-old in 2014, depict her admitting it was wrong to attack a little girl but gloating over the light punishment. She boasted that nothing would happen to her after she pleaded guilty due to Democrat District Attorney George Gascon's policies and laughed that she won't have to go back to prison or register as a sex offender. She also made explicit remarks about the victim that are unfit to print. ""I’m gonna plead out to it, plead guilty,"" Tubbs says in one recording. ""They’re gonna stick me on probation, and it’s gonna be dropped, it’s gonna be done, I won’t have to register, won’t have to do nothing."" CALIFORNIA TRANS CHILD MOLESTER, 26, GETS 2 YEARS IN JUVENILE FACILITY THANKS TO PROGRESSIVE DA GEORGE GASCON ""You won’t have to register?"" her father asks on the other line later in the conversation. ""I won’t have to do none of that,"" Tubbs replies. ""So what are they going to do to you then?"" ""Nothing,"" Tubbs answers, then laughs. Tubbs pleaded guilty last month to the cold case attack, which took place in women’s restroom at a Denny’s restaurant, when the suspect was two weeks shy of 18 and identified as a male named James Tubbs. After being arrested roughly eight years after the crime, Tubbs began identifying as a woman, according to prosecutors. She received a sentence of two years at a juvenile facility because Gascon’s office declined to transfer the case to adult court, adhering to one of the progressive prosecutor’s day-one directives barring ""children"" from being tried as adults. She could serve as little as six months and won’t have to register as a sex offender. LOS ANGELES COUNTY DA GEORGE GASCON BACKPEDALS ON PROGRESSIVE DIRECTIVES AMID CRIME WAVE, PUBLIC BLOWBACK Tubbs’ victim, who was 10 at the time of the attack, told Fox News Digital that Gascon’s handling of the case has been ""insulting"" and ""unfair"" to her. ""The things he did to me and made me do that day was beyond horrible for a ten-year-old girl to have to go through,"" she said. ""I want him tried as an adult for the crimes he committed against me."" She said the light sentence was offensive and hurtful and offered her ""no true justice."" ""I’ve also heard that my attacker goes by she/them pronouns now,"" she added. ""I see it also unfair to try him as a woman as well, seeing how he clearly didn’t act like one on January 1st of 2014."" LA PROSECUTOR BLASTS POLICY CHANGE AMID CONTROVERSY OVER TRANS CHILD MOLESTER CASE In one of the calls, Tubbs asks the caller to start using female pronouns. ""So now they're going to put me with other trannies that have seen their cases like mine or with one tranny like me that has a case like mine,"" Tubbs says. ""So when you come to court, make sure you address me as her."" Then she says that if she goes to prison she’s getting a sex change surgery to go into the women's facility, and the other person says, ""There's some b---es in there too."" Gascon issued a statement Sunday addressing the case. ""Like every responsible office, we learn as we go, take feedback from the community, and make necessary adjustments based on our experiences and the complex nature of this work,"" he said, adding that ""a small number of cases"" necessitate flexibility denied to his prosecutors under his edicts. CALIFORNIA BILL WOULD ALLOW CITIZENS TO ENFORCE GUN BAN, MODELED AFTER TEXAS HEARTBEAT LAW ""Specifically, we learned a lot from the Hannah Tubbs case about the need for a policy safety valve,"" Gascon said. He also admitted that Tubbs went on after the 2014 attack to commit other offenses – including one in which DNA evidence linked her to the Denny’s assault. ""Ms. Tubbs had several charges in other counties after the juvenile offense but never received any services which both her past behavior and that subsequent to her arrest demonstrates she clearly needs,"" Gascon said. ""After her sentencing in our case, I became aware of extremely troubling statements she made about her case, the resolution of it and the young girl that she harmed."" The recordings, however, were made in November, and sources tell Fox News Digital that prosecutors were well aware of them. Last Wednesday, Gascon’s chief deputy Sharon Woo sent a memo to prosecutors back off a blanket ban on seeking to try juveniles in adult court. At the time, Gascon’s office denied the move had any connection to the Tubbs case and instead said the change came as prosecutors await a series of state Supreme Court decisions that are expected to send multiple cases back to Los Angeles. Then on Friday, in a series of five memos sent to staff, Gascon backpedaled on his other directives, saying exceptions could be made to once again bring charges that would carry sentences of life without parole and allow juveniles to be tried in adult court. He will continue to block his office from seeking the death penalty. Gascon conceded that he’d come to accept his policies were too rigid ""after listening to the community, victims and colleagues.""",U.S./Fox News,California trans child molester Hannah Tubbs gloats over light sentence in jailhouse phone calls,https://news.yahoo.com/california-trans-child-molester-hannah-165449299.html
2/22/2022,"(Reuters) -Police in Portland, Oregon, said they believe a shooting that left one woman dead and five people wounded at a protest over police violence on Saturday night was triggered by a clash between an armed homeowner and armed demonstrators. The shooting took place as people gathered in northeast Portland on Saturday to protest the death of Amir Locke, the 22-year-old fatally shot earlier this month by law enforcement in Minneapolis during a no-knock apartment raid. The Portland Police Bureau said in a statement on Sunday that a preliminary investigation indicated the incident ""started with a confrontation between an armed homeowner and armed protesters"" but that detectives were still struggling to gather evidence. In an online briefing on Sunday afternoon, department spokesperson Nathan Sheppard said detectives believe numerous people either saw the shooting or recorded it on their phones but have not cooperated with police. The police said they found one woman dead when they arrived at the scene in the Rose City Park neighborhood on Saturday night. They have not identified the deceased or the five wounded people who were taken to area hospitals for treatment. Protesters at Normandale Park were getting ready to march when a man who lives close by confronted them and later opened fire, striking multiple people, the Oregonian reported on Sunday, citing a source with direct knowledge of the investigation. The Portland-based newspaper said that at least one protester shot back at the man who had opened fire. Of the five wounded in the incident, the man is one of three people who suffered life-threatening injuries, the newspaper said. The police believe the man acted alone and is not affiliated with any political group, the Oregonian said. The protester who shot back at the man was initially arrested on assault and weapons charges but will likely be released and the charges dropped, the newspaper said. During the news briefing, Sheppard declined to offer any details on the investigation, including whether anyone has been arrested in connection with the shooting. Pressed on why he would not confirm or deny an arrest, Shepperd said it would be ""irresponsible"" due to the ""complicated"" nature of the incident. Portland was rocked by months of anti-racism protests following the death of George Floyd, an African-American who died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes in May 2020. The city has also been a magnet for clashes between political extremists, with violent skirmishes breaking out between people associated with the far-right Proud Boys and members of antifa, the loosely organized anti-fascist movement. Like many other big U.S. cities, Portland has seen a spike in murders over the past two years, a phenomenon experts have attributed partly to the social disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

2/22/2022,"A Wells Fargo executive said drug testing for marijuana is causing a shortage of truck drivers. As more states move to legalize cannabis, standards for drug testing truckers have become more stringent. As of December, over 60,000 truckers have been temporarily taken off the road for testing positive for marijuana use. While the grueling lifestyle and aging workforce has led to a national shortage of truck drivers, a Wells Fargo executive believes there's another issue exacerbating the labor crunch — marijuana testing. According to Chris Harvey, Wells Fargo's head of equity strategy, drug screenings paired with the nature of the job — which often requires truckers to spend weeks-on-end away from home — has led many truck drivers to leave the industry. Harvey said the issue will ""continue to push that price even higher,"" worsening a surge in transportation costs that have left consumers facing price hikes and shortages. ""It's really about drug testing,"" Harvey said, speaking at an industry conference on Wednesday. ""We've legalized marijuana in some states but, obviously, not all ... What we've done is we're excluding a significant portion of that trucker industry."" The role of marijuana testing in employee screening has been under debate in recent years, especially as the labor shortage continues to place more power in the hands of workers. At the same time, marijuana use has become more accepted: Last year, a Gallup poll of consumer habits found that 49% of US adults have used the drug at least once. To date, 37 states have legalized the use of cannabis for medical purposes, while 18 have cleared the substance for recreational use. But, in recent years, the trucking industry's drug policies have become even more stringent. Truck drivers are randomly drug tested on a quarterly basis, as well as in the event of an accident or traffic ticket, according to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. Drivers that test positive are immediately removed from driving commercial motor vehicles, per the FMCSA. In 2020, the trucking industry implemented a law that required all truck drivers who had failed a drug test to be listed in a federal database so that other trucking companies would avoid hiring the drivers. Previously, drivers could theoretically move to a new company that would not have knowledge of the positive drug test. The law has impacted nearly 110,000 truckers, about 56% of which were reported for marijuana use, according to government data from December 2021. These 60,000 drivers who tested positive for marijuana use in the past two years could help plug the shortage of about 80,000 truckers that the American Trucking Association has reported. Since the database was launched, more than 6.4 million queries have been conducted on the site as of late December, as all employers must consult the database before they approve a new driver. As of December, more than 81,000 drivers were ""prohibited"" from work — over 75% of which had not begun the lengthy reassessment process required before they can return to duty.

2/22/2022,"By Andrew Osborn and Mark Trevelyan MOSCOW (Reuters) - Seated at a large white table in an echoing Kremlin hall, Vladimir Putin summoned his top security officials one by one on Monday to give him their advice at a potential turning point in the crisis around Ukraine. In a lengthy meeting of his Security Council, broadcast on state television in what a presenter called ""unprecedented footage"", Putin cross-examined ministers and spy chiefs on the question of whether to recognise the two breakaway Donbass regions of eastern Ukraine as independent states. One after another, they walked to a white lectern in the column-lined hall to paint a relentlessly grim picture of the situation in Donbass. Looking pale and tired, Putin drummed with his fingers from time to time as he listened. His special representative on Ukraine, Dmitry Kozak, said Kyiv and the West had no interest in implementing a 2015 peace deal to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian separatists have been fighting Ukrainian government forces for the past eight years. The head of the FSB security service, Alexander Bortnikov, told Putin the security situation in the two breakaway regions was deteriorating, and that nearly 70,000 people had so far fled to Russia. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu accused Ukraine of stepping up shelling of the separatist regions - which Kyiv has strongly denied - and said some residents had been left without gas or water. Much was riding on the president's decision. Recognition of the separatist regions could provide Russia with a pretext to openly send its military forces into the Donbass and justify that by arguing that it was protecting residents there from Ukraine. It would also effectively kill off the Minsk peace agreements that all sides, including Russia, have until now called the only possible route out of the crisis. But Putin was taking his time. SHOW OF AUTHORITY At one point he intervened to emphasise that he had not discussed in advance what the officials were going to tell him, as if to dispel the impression that the proceedings had been choreographed. In reality, the televised meeting appeared calculated to convey the impression of a leader carefully arriving at an important decision after weighing all the evidence from his subordinates. It also gave Putin the chance to demonstrate his authority over the most powerful people in the land, putting them in their place if they slipped up. He jumped in to chastise foreign intelligence chief Sergei Naryshkin when the latter said he ""will support"" recognition of the Donbass regions. ""Will support, or do support? Tell me straight, Sergei Yevgenievich,"" Putin said. When Naryshkin then said he supported the breakaway regions becoming part of Russia, Putin upbraided him again: ""We're not talking about that... We're talking about whether to recognise their independence or not."" Naryshkin: ""Yes, I support the proposal to recognise their independence."" Putin: ""Ok, please sit down, thank you."" With all the reports delivered, all eyes turned to Putin to pronounce his verdict - but he was not yet ready to end the suspense. ""A decision will be taken today,"" he said - and with that, the cameras stopped rolling.

2/22/2022,"The launch of Truth Social is reportedly imminent and the commentary on Twitter is already heating up. Former President Donald Trump’s social media app will launch on Apple’s app store on Monday, according to Reuters, which reportedly accessed a test version of the app this week. Trump has been banned from Twitter and other mainstream social media sites for more than a year and is suing the company along with Facebook and Google, accusing them of censorship and claiming they infringed his First Amendment rights. He was banned after he violated each of the companies’ user policies with his inflammatory rhetoric about the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. He attempted to recover his online presence last year with the launch of a blog, which tanked after a month. He’s now trying to rival Twitter with his new service, casting it as an alternative that champions free speech, though some critics have already predicted it’s destined to fail like so many other Trump-branded ventures before it. Last week, Donald Trump Jr. sparked derision when he went on Twitter of all places to promote and recruit for Truth Social. Already, the app has been criticized for its resemblance to Twitter. Tech experts have also highlighted a number of major security issues throughout the testing phase, including one which reportedly allowed a Daily Dot reporter to secure the same handle as Trump on the company’s internal beta system. Some users who pre-ordered the app said late Sunday that it was available in Apple’s app store, though they reported issues with creating an account. Vocal right-wing Trump allies including Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) and Arizona state Rep. Wendy Rogers lauded the launch of the app Sunday and tweeted they had already registered profiles. Trump critics rounded up some “Truths” of their own and predicted how the venture would play out.

2/22/2022,"President Putin has unilaterally declared that two chunks of Eastern Ukraine should be considered independent states in a dramatic escalation that many fear could lead to all-out war. In an address to his nation on Monday, the Russian president formally announced the “the immediate recognition” of the pro-Kremlin regions of Luhansk and Donetsk—which stretch over 6,500 miles—as independent of Ukraine. The move follows a spectacularly bizarre meeting by Russia’s Security Council, where Putin appeared like a mob boss testing his underlings, as officials, one after another, spoke out in favor of recognizing the self-proclaimed republics. It was another grotesque spectacle on a day when the drum beats of war grew deafening. The aggressive and totally unjustified territorial claim followed a series of apparent false-flag operations where the Russians tried to blame Ukrainian forces for a number of attacks. The Russian military claimed that five so-called “saboteurs” were assassinated early Monday after crossing into Russia from Ukraine. The report mirrors almost exactly what the Biden administration warned could be “false flags” or trigger points that Russia will respond to as a pretext to launch its invasion. “As a result of clashes, five people who violated the Russian border from a group of saboteurs were killed,” the Russian military said in a statement, according to Reuters. No Russians died in the alleged border infraction. Russia also said Ukraine had destroyed a border outpost used by the FSB (Federal Security Service) in early morning shelling. Russia has also claimed in recent days that Ukrainian forces are staging attacks on Luhansk and Donetsk. Ukraine has denied any such incursion or attacks took place. The Minister of Foreign affairs, Dmytro Kuleba, took to Twitter Monday to dismiss the claims with big red ‘X’s denying an attack on Donetsk or Luhansk, or that it sent saboteurs over the Russian border, or that it shelled Russian territory or border crossings. No, Ukraine did NOT:❌Attack Donetsk or Luhansk❌Send saboteurs or APCs over the Russian border❌Shell Russian territory❌Shell Russian border crossing❌Conduct acts of sabotage Ukraine also does NOT plan any such actions.Russia, stop your fake-producing factory now. — Dmytro Kuleba (@DmytroKuleba) February 21, 2022 After the latest round of supposed Ukrainian aggression, the leaders of the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics published video appeals pleading with Putin to recognize their independence, as they claimed Ukrainian forces were preparing to attack. Despite a flurry of last-minute attempts at diplomacy—including talk of a summit between presidents Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin—all hell seems soon to break loose in Ukraine. Monday, Biden’s national security advisor Jake Sullivan warned that Russia’s imminent attack on Ukraine will be “extremely violent” and that it could begin literally at any moment. “We believe that any military operation of this size, scope and magnitude of what we believe the Russians are planning will be extremely violent,” he told NBC Today show on a frenzied circuit of morning TV on President’s Day. “It will cost the lives of Ukrainians and Russians, civilians and military personnel alike.” He told the network that new intelligence garnered in recent days suggest “an even greater form of brutality because this will not simply be some conventional war between two armies.” He went on to say Russia will target the Ukrainian people “to repress them, to crush them, to harm them.” He then appeared on ABC Good Morning America, telling them that “all signs look like President Putin and the Russians are proceeding with a plan to execute a major military invasion of Ukraine.” That plan was bolstered over the weekend with Russian military hardware painted with an ominous white “Z” lettering rolling toward strategic points along the Ukrainian frontier. “We have seen just in the last 24 hours further moves of Russian units to the border with no other good explanation other than they’re getting in position to attack.” The National Security Advisor to President Biden, @jakejsullivan, joins us to discuss the Ukraine crisis. pic.twitter.com/xaWogFyPID — TODAY (@TODAYshow) February 21, 2022 Over the weekend, French President Emmanuel Macron invited Biden and Putin to a summit, which Biden signaled he would attend on the condition that Russian not invade Ukraine, but the Kremlin called reports of any such meeting “premature.” As Sullivan reiterated that any attack on Ukraine would be met with the “full force of American and Allied might,” unsubstantiated news reports of ceasefire infractions along the border continue unabated.

2/22/2022,"YUROK RESERVATION, Calif. (AP) — The young mother had behaved erratically for months, hitchhiking and wandering naked through two Native American reservations and a small town clustered along Northern California’s rugged Lost Coast. But things escalated when Emmilee Risling was charged with arson for igniting a fire in a cemetery. Her family hoped the case would force her into mental health and addiction services. Instead, she was released over the pleas of loved ones and a tribal police chief. The 33-year-old college graduate — an accomplished traditional dancer with ancestry from three area tribes — was last seen soon after, walking across a bridge near a place marked End of Road, a far corner of the Yurok Reservation where the rutted pavement dissolves into thick woods. Her disappearance is one of five instances in the past 18 months where Indigenous women have gone missing or been killed in this isolated expanse of Pacific coastline between San Francisco and Oregon, a region where the Yurok, Hupa, Karuk, Tolowa and Wiyot people have coexisted for millennia. Two other women died from what authorities say were overdoses despite relatives’ questions about severe bruises. The crisis has spurred the Yurok Tribe to issue an emergency declaration and brought increased urgency to efforts to build California’s first database of such cases and regain sovereignty over key services. “I came to this issue as both a researcher and a learner, but just in this last year, I knew three of the women who have gone missing or were murdered — and we shared so much in common,” said Blythe George, a Yurok tribal member who consults on a project documenting the problem. “You can’t help but see yourself in those people.” ___ The recent cases spotlight an epidemic that is difficult to quantify but has long disproportionately plagued Native Americans. A 2021 report by a government watchdog found the true number of missing and murdered Indigenous women is unknown due to reporting problems, distrust of law enforcement and jurisdictional conflicts. But Native women face murder rates almost three times those of white women overall — and up to 10 times the national average in certain locations, according to a 2021 summary of the existing research by the National Congress of American Indians. More than 80% have experienced violence. In this area peppered with illegal marijuana farms and defined by wilderness, almost everyone knows someone who has vanished. Missing person posters flutter from gas station doors and road signs. Even the tribal police chief isn’t untouched: He took in the daughter of one missing woman, and Emmilee — an enrolled Hoopa Valley tribal member with Yurok and Karuk blood — babysat his children. In California alone, the Yurok Tribe and the Sovereign Bodies Institute, an Indigenous-run research and advocacy group, uncovered 18 cases of missing or slain Native American women in roughly the past year — a number they consider a vast undercount. An estimated 62% of those cases are not listed in state or federal databases for missing persons. Hupa citizen Brandice Davis attended school with the daughters of a woman who disappeared in 1991 and now has daughters of her own, ages 9 and 13. “Here, we’re all related, in a sense,” she said of the place where many families are connected by marriage or community ties. She cautions her daughters about what it means to be female, Native American and growing up on a reservation: “You’re a statistic. But we have to keep going. We have to show people we’re still here.” ___ Like countless cases involving Indigenous women, Emmilee’s disappearance has gotten no attention from the outside world. But many here see in her story the ugly intersection of generations of trauma inflicted on Native Americans by their white colonizers, the marginalization of Native peoples and tribal law enforcement’s lack of authority over many crimes committed on their land. Virtually all of the area’s Indigenous residents, including Emmilee, have ancestors who were shipped to boarding schools as children and forced to give up their language and culture as part of a federal assimilation campaign. Further back, Yurok people spent years away from home as indentured servants for colonizers, said Judge Abby Abinanti, the tribe’s chief judge. The trauma caused by those removals echoes among the Yurok in the form of drug abuse and domestic violence, which trickles down to the youth, she said. About 110 Yurok children are in foster care. “You say, ‘OK, how did we get to this situation where we’re losing our children?’” said Abinanti. “There were big gaps in knowledge, including parenting, and generationally those play out.” An analysis of cases by the Yurok and Sovereign Bodies found most of the region’s missing women had either been in foster care themselves or had children taken from them by the state. An analysis of jail bookings also showed Yurok citizens in the two-county region are 11 times more likely to go to jail in a given year — and half those arrested are female, usually for low-level crimes. That’s an arrest rate for Yurok women roughly five times the rate of female incarcerations nationwide, said George, the University of California, Merced sociologist consulting with the tribe. The Yurok run a tribal wellness court for addiction and operate one of the country’s only state-certified tribal domestic violence perpetrator programs. They also recently hired a tribal prosecutor, another step toward building an Indigenous justice system that would ultimately handle all but the most serious felonies. The Yurok also are working to reclaim supervision over foster care and hope to transfer their first foster family from state court within months, said Jessica Carter, the Yurok Tribal Court director. A tribal-run guardianship court follows another 50 children who live with relatives. The long-term plan — mostly funded by grants — is a massive undertaking that will take years to accomplish, but the Yurok see regaining sovereignty over these systems as the only way to end the cycle of loss that’s taken the greatest toll on their women. “If we are successful, we can use that as a gift to other tribes to say, ‘Here’s the steps we took,’” said Rosemary Deck, the newly hired tribal prosecutor. “‘You can take this as a blueprint and assert your own sovereignty.’” ___ Emmilee was born into a prominent Native family, and a bright future beckoned. Starting at a young age, she was groomed to one day lead the intricate dances that knit the modern-day people to generations of tradition nearly broken by colonization. Her family, a “dance family,” has the rare distinction of owning enough regalia that it can outfit the brush, jump and flower dances without borrowing a single piece. At 15, Emmilee paraded down the National Mall with other tribal members at the opening of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of the American Indian. The Washington Post published a front-page photo of her in a Karuk dress of dried bear grass, a woven basket cap and a white leather sash adorned with Pileated woodpecker scalps. The straight-A student earned a scholarship to the University of Oregon, where she helped lead a prominent Native students' group. Her success, however, was darkened by the first sign of trouble: an abusive relationship with a Native man whom, her mother believes, she felt she could save through her positive influence. Later, Emmilee dated another man, became pregnant and returned home to have the baby before finishing her degree. She then worked with disadvantaged Native families and eventually got accepted into a master’s program. She helped coach her son’s T-ball team and signed him up for swim lessons. But over time, her family says, they noticed changes. Emmilee was uncharacteristically tardy for work and grew more combative. She often dropped off her son with family, and she fell in with another abusive boyfriend. Her son was removed from her care when he was 5; a girl born in 2020 was taken away as a newborn as Emmilee’s behavior deteriorated. Her parents remain bewildered by her rapid decline and think she developed a mental illness — possibly postpartum psychosis — compounded by drugs and the trauma of domestic abuse. At first, she would see a doctor or therapist at her family’s insistence but eventually rebuffed all help. After her daughter’s birth, Emmilee spiraled rapidly, “like a light switched,” and she began to let go of the Native identity that had been her defining force, said her sister, Mary. “That was her life, and when you let that go, when you don’t have your kids ... what are you?” she said. ___ In the months before she vanished, Emmilee was frequently seen walking naked in public, talking to herself. She was picked up many times by sheriff’s deputies and tribal police but never charged. The only in-patient psychiatric facility within 300 miles (480 kilometers) was always too full to admit her. Once, she was taken to the emergency room and fled barefoot in her hospital gown. “People tended to look the other way. They didn’t really help her. In less than 24 hours, she was just back on the street, literally on the street,” said Judy Risling, her mother. “There were just no services for her.” In September, Emmilee was arrested after she was found dancing around a small fire in the Hoopa Valley Reservation cemetery. Then-Hoopa Valley Tribal Police Chief Bob Kane appeared in a Humboldt County court by video and explained her repeated police contacts and mental health problems. Emmilee mumbled during the hearing then shouted out that she didn’t set the fire. She was released with an order to appear again in 12 days after her public defender argued she had no criminal convictions and the court couldn’t hold her on the basis of her mental health. Then, Emmilee disappeared. “We had predicted that something like this may ... happen in the future,” said Kane. “And you know, now we’re here.” ____ If Emmilee fell through the cracks before she went missing, she has become even more invisible in her absence. One of the biggest hurdles in Indian Country once a woman is reported missing is unraveling a confusing jumble of federal, state, local and tribal agencies that must coordinate. Poor communication and oversights can result in overlooked evidence or delayed investigations. The problem is more acute in rural regions like the one where Emmilee disappeared, said Abigail Echo-Hawk, citizen of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma and director of the Urban Indian Health Institute in Seattle. “Particularly in reservations and in village areas, there is a maze of jurisdictions, of policies, of procedures of who investigates what,” she said. Moreover, many cases aren’t logged in federal missing persons databases, and medical examiners sometimes misclassify Native women as white or Asian, said Gretta Goodwin, of the U.S. Government Accountability Office’s homeland security and justice team. Recent efforts at the state and federal level  seek to address what advocates say have been decades of neglect regarding missing and murdered Indigenous women. Former President Donald Trump signed a bill that required federal, state, tribal and local law enforcement agencies to create or update their protocols for handling such cases. And in November, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to set up guidelines between the federal government and tribal police that would help track, solve and prevent crimes against all Native Americans. A number of states, including California, Oregon, Washington and Arizona, are also taking on the crisis with greater funding to tribes, studies of the problem or proposals to create Amber Alert-style notifications. ___ Emmilee’s case illustrates some of the challenges. She was a citizen of the Hoopa Valley Tribe and was arrested on its reservation, but she is presumed missing on the neighboring Yurok Tribe’s reservation. The Yurok police are in charge of the missing persons probe, but the Humboldt County Sheriff’s Office will decide when to declare the case cold, which could trigger federal help. The remote terrain where Emmilee was last seen — two hours from the nearest town — created hurdles common on reservations. Law enforcement determined there wasn’t enough information to launch a formal search and rescue operation in such a vast, mountainous area. The Yurok police opted to forgo their own search because of liability concerns and a lack of training, said Yurok Tribal Police Chief Greg O’Rourke. Instead, Yurok and Hoopa Valley police and sheriff’s deputies plied the rain-swollen Klamath River by boat and drove back roads. Emmilee’s father, Gary Risling, says the sheriff’s office failed to act on anonymous tips, was slow to follow up on possible sightings and focused more resources on other missing person’s cases, including a wayward hunter and a kayaker lost at sea. “I don’t want to seem like I’m picking on them, but that effort is sure not put forward when it becomes a missing Indian woman,” he said. Humboldt County Sheriff William Honsal declined interview requests, saying the Yurok are in charge and there are no signs of foul play. O’Rourke said the tips aren’t enough for a search warrant and there’s nothing further the tribal police can do. The police chief, who knew Emmilee well, says his work is frequently stymied by a broader system that discounts tribal sovereignty. “The role of police is protect the vulnerable. As tribal police, we’re doing that in a system that’s broken,” he said. “I think that is the reason that Native women get all but dismissed.” Emmilee’s family, meanwhile, is struggling to shield her children, now 10 and almost 2, from the trauma of their mother’s disappearance — trauma they worry could trigger another generational cycle of loss. The boy has been having nightmares and recently spoke everyone’s worst fear. “It’s real difficult when you deal with the grandkids, and the grandkid says, ‘Grandpa, can you take me down the river and can we look for my mama?’ What do you tell him? ‘We’re looking, we’re looking every day,’” said Gary Risling, choking back tears. “And then he says, ‘What happens if we can’t find her?’” ____ Associated Press video journalist Manuel Valdes in Seattle contributed to this report. ___ Follow Gillian Flaccus on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/gflaccus",U.S./Associated Press,Tribe grapples with missing women crisis on California coast,https://news.yahoo.com/california-tribe-confronts-crisis-missing-050750665.html

2/22/2022,"MOSCOW, Feb 21 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin railed against Ukraine in a televised address on Monday, saying that neo-Nazis were on the rise, oligarchic clans were rife and that the ex-Soviet country was a U.S. colony with a puppet regime. Russia's rouble, already under pressure from a vast Russian military buildup near Ukraine, tumbled to new weeks-long lows as he spoke from behind a wooden office desk flanked by Russian tricolour flags. He described eastern Ukraine as ancient Russian lands and modern Ukraine as a state created by the Bolsheviks after the 1917 revolution. He said that Ukraine never had a tradition of genuine statehood and complained that post-Soviet Ukraine had wanted everything it could from Moscow without doing anything in return. Ahead of the speech, Putin said that Russia would decide on Monday whether or not to recognise the independence of two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine.
