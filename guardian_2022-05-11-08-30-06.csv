5/11/2022,"A senior cleric who fought an epic three-and-a-half-year battle over efforts to oust him as head of Christ Church, Oxford, has announced he is quitting the Church of England. Martyn Percy, the dean of Christ Church Cathedral as well as head of one of Oxford’s most venerable colleges, left his position last month after reaching a settlement involving a substantial payoff. He revealed in an interview in the Times last weekend that he had a serious breakdown during the prolonged dispute and came close to considering suicide. He criticised the bishop of Oxford for “writing a very public letter … saying that it was inappropriate for people to be defending me in public when I was being attacked in public”. Now he has announced his decision to leave the C of E in an article for Prospect magazine, citing the “parlous state of safeguarding” within the church. “In the face of … partisanship, failure to neutrally manage conflicts of interest, double standards and incompetence in the C of E’s safeguarding, I finally took a decision: to leave the church,” he said. “Though I have been ordained for more than 30 years, and continue with my faith in God, the Church of England has destroyed any trust I might have had in it. It is an unsafe place to work.” His experience of being accused of safeguarding failures and a charge of sexual harassment led him to conclude that the C of E “lacks transparency, accountability, external scrutiny and, as far as I am concerned, integrity”. Within the church, there was a “culture of bullying and harassment afflicting many clergy”, he said. The C of E was spending tens of millions of pounds a year on safeguarding, “most of which is frittered away on procedures that seem cosmetically adequate, yet ultimately lack the professional standards one would find in other spheres”. The protracted dispute between Percy and the governing body of Christ Church cost millions of pounds and caused serious reputational damage to the 476-year-old college, which has produced 13 British prime ministers and 17 archbishops. At the heart of the dispute was Percy’s pay and his efforts to reform the college’s governance, but he was accused of behaviour of an “immoral, scandalous or disgraceful nature”. In June 2019, all complaints against Percy were dismissed by a retired high court judge, and his reinstatement ordered. However, efforts by the governing body to remove Percy from his post continued. In February this year, the college agreed to pay a “substantial” sum to Percy and reimburse his legal costs. It also agreed to an independent review of its governance. A spokesperson for Steven Croft, the bishop of Oxford, said he had gone to “considerable lengths to care for Martyn Percy”, adding: “This has been a complex and painful process for all concerned over the past two years, much of which has been inaccurately played out by supporters of Dr Percy in the media and online.” The diocese had commissioned an independent review to be led by the C of E independent safeguarding board.

5/11/2022,"Ministers’ threats to send unauthorised migrants to Rwanda are having a detrimental impact on the physical and psychological health of people seeking asylum, according to two major refugee charities. The British Red Cross and the Refugee Council, which worked with nearly 44,000 people in the asylum process, warn that they are disappearing from hotels and are reluctant to claim support for fear of deportation, detention and other harsh measures. The development comes as the Home Office admitted that LGBTQ+ refugees could be persecuted if sent to Rwanda – but still plans to fly them 4,000 miles to the capital, Kigali. The Home Office’s human rights assessment itself was also questioned on Tuesday, with the chief inspector of immigration asking for it to be independently scrutinised. The non-governmental organisation Human Rights Watch has described it as full of “blatant falsehoods”. Mike Adamson, chief executive at the British Red Cross, said: “We are hearing directly from many people seeking asylum of the distress and anxiety recent announcements have provoked. People are telling us that they feel less safe and less welcome in the UK. “It’s therefore unsurprising that people’s psychological safety and sense that they are welcome has been eroded, and that people [are] considering going underground leaving themselves without formal support and in very vulnerable positions.” Those supported by the Red Cross include: A Rwandan asylum seeker who contacted the Red Cross in south-east England fearing he could be sent back to the country. He disclosed that he would be in hiding and refraining from accessing support so he is not identified by the authorities. An Afghan man living in temporary accommodation in the east Midlands who disclosed that he had gone into hiding, fearing that he would be detained and sent to Rwanda. He said that many of his friends were in the same situation and planned to go underground. An asylum seeker from Ethiopia based in the West Midlands said that he feels anxious about the passing of the Nationality and Borders Act and disclosed he had left his accommodation out of fear that he will be sent to Rwanda. An Afghan asylum seeker also based in the West Midlands who said he feels he is a second-class refugee as he is not eligible for recent schemes designed to support Ukrainians. Enver Solomon, chief executive at the Refugee Council, said: “We are hearing tragic stories about the severe impact on mental health, including young, vulnerable children who are terrified what will happen to them, with reports of self-harm. We are concerned the government is not seeing the face behind the case and should be doing far more to exercise its duty of care towards vulnerable people.” It comes the day after the Home Office said the first group of people would be informed this week of the government’s intention to relocate them to Rwanda. The first flights are expected to take place in the coming months, it said, adding that lawyers for some of those affected were likely to launch proceedings to stop their removal. The equality impact assessment released on Monday said there were “concerns over the treatment of some LGBTQI+ people but we will continue to consider the impact on this group and take into account further evidence over the course of the partnership”. The report noted that homosexuality was decriminalised in Rwanda in 2010, but warned: “At this stage, investigations point to ill treatment being more than one-off.” The government’s assessment of Rwanda’s human rights record stated that there were “not substantial grounds” for believing people would be at risk of treatment contrary to article 3 (freedom from torture and inhuman or degrading treatment) of the European convention of human rights in Rwanda. But Lewis Mudge, central Africa director at Human Rights Watch, said the risk assessment was unrealistic. “The Home Office’s report reads like some serious wishful thinking,” he said. “They seem to change the facts in order to justify a preordained conclusion, from claiming that refugees are not targeted for exercising their freedom of expression – when Congolese refugees rot in jail for protesting their living conditions – to claiming that LGBT people won’t risk serious harm in Rwanda – when evidence we have collected has LGBTI people detained, beaten, insulted and harassed for their sexual identity.”",News/World news,Threat of being sent to Rwanda ‘harming health of UK asylum seekers’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/11/threat-of-being-sent-to-rwanda-harming-health-of-uk-asylum-seekers
5/11/2022,"How migrating animals like sea turtles navigate hundreds to thousands of kilometres across the open ocean has intrigued biologists since Charles Darwin. But some sea turtles might not really know where they’re going, new research suggests. Analysis by an international team of scientists has mapped the movements of hawksbill turtles as they swam from their nesting grounds in the Chagos Archipelago to foraging sites also in the Indian Ocean. It found the turtles often travelled in circuitous routes when migrating short distances, suggesting the animals’ navigational sense is relatively crude while in the open ocean. The turtles typically travelled twice the required distance to their target locations. One individual swam 1,306km to reach an island that was a mere 176km away – travelling more than seven times the beeline distance. The team tagged and tracked via satellite 22 hawksbill turtles after they had finished nesting. Generally, sea turtles do not forage and nest in the same geographical area. These animals would have already undergone a migration from their foraging grounds, a mating season, and have laid multiple clutches of eggs before preparing for the return trip. Chair in marine science at Deakin University and the study’s first author, Prof Graeme Hays, said if the turtles were perfect navigators, they would probably travel in direct paths from their nesting sites to foraging areas in search for food. “Those turtles that we’re tracking – they most probably hadn’t eaten for four or five months,” he said. Previous research has suggested that turtles likely imprint on the magnetic field of their birth area – where they later return to lay eggs – and detect changes in the Earth’s magnetic field as a means of navigating through the ocean. Hays said the new study suggested the turtles “almost certainly are using a geomagnetic map, but it’s a fairly coarse resolution”. “So it doesn’t allow pinpoint straight-line migration, but it does tell them when they’re getting a long way off route,” he said. Hawksbill turtles typically migrate distances of about 150km, a modest distance compared with the migration of green turtles, Hays said. “For green turtles that nest in the Chagos Archipelago … we’ve tracked them going almost 5,000km to their foraging grounds,” he said. “They’ll swim all the way across the Indian Ocean to the mainland African coast. “Although it’s a long journey, in a sense it’s actually quite an easy navigational task because all the turtle has to do is swim vaguely westwards and it’ll eventually hit Africa.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Though hawksbill turtles were making far shorter migrations in comparison, they had the tricky navigational task of locating small, specific places like remote isolated islands or submerged banks. The new research suggests the turtles’ geomagnetic map sense is not fine-grained enough to locate specific targets. When closer to their intended locations, the animals likely use other navigational cues including sense of smell and visual landmarks, Hays said. “In the final stages, they can smell an island that they’re headed to.” “As they get some sort of visual landmark, for example, the water starts to get a bit shallower and they can see the seabed, then they probably got some sort of cognitive map of that area. They could probably just recognise the seafloor, just like you would recognise visual landmarks in the area where you live.” The research, published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.",News/World news,"Migrating turtles don’t really know where they’re going, study shows",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/11/migrating-turtles-dont-really-know-where-theyre-going-study-shows
5/11/2022,"An Adidas campaign featuring dozens of sets of breasts to promote the diversity of its range of sports bras has been banned by the UK advertising watchdog for using explicit nudity and appearing where children could see the ads. The campaign, versions of which ran on Twitter and select large poster sites, prompted 24 complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) that the ads were gratuitous, objectified women by “sexualising them and reducing them to body parts”, were harmful and offensive and were able to be seen by children. Adidas UK defended the images, saying they were not gratuitous or sexual but were intended to “reflect and celebrate different shapes and sizes and illustrate diversity”. The sportswear company said the images had been cropped to protect the identity of the models, and that they had all volunteered and were supportive of the campaign’s aims. Adidas added that it had not run the ads on posters or billboards near schools or religious venues, and did not think the campaign would cause harm or distress to children. The ASA said the depiction of naked breasts, including in one ad where pixellation was used to blur the nipples of the models, was “likely to be seen as explicit nudity”. “We noted the breasts were the main focus in the ads, and there was less emphasis on the bras themselves, which were only referred to in the accompanying text,” the ASA said. “As the ads contained explicit nudity, we considered that they required careful targeting to avoid causing offence to those who viewed them.” The ASA said the large poster sites were not targeted and could be seen by people of all ages, including children, and the ads were therefore likely to cause widespread offence. The use of the ad on the Adidas Twitter feed was not in keeping with the usual content posted, the ASA said, and also likely to offend. “The ads must not appear again in the forms complained of,” ruled the ASA. “We told Adidas UK to ensure their ads did not cause offence and were targeted responsibly.” ",News/Media,Adidas sports bra ads banned in UK for objectifying women,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/11/adidas-sports-bra-ads-banned-uk-twitter-asa

5/11/2022,"By the end, Alisson was trying to waste time. Sadio Mané was listlessly dribbling the ball into the corner in an attempt to burn away a few more seconds. Deep into injury time Naby Keïta started rolling around on the turf in apparent agony. Was it a cruciate? A broken leg? A debilitating muscle tear that would put him out for the season? Happily, as a victorious Keïta disappeared into the embrace of his teammates just a few seconds later, we have to conclude that he may just survive the night. Curiously, given his famously forthright views on teams adopting cynical tactics in an attempt to win games, Jürgen Klopp had very little to say about any of this afterwards. But then, perhaps it was understandable that aesthetics would be the last thing on his mind at Villa Park. This was the sort of win you have to extract like one of your own teeth, the sort of win that almost feels too debasing to truly celebrate, the sort of win you pull out on the day your title rivals sign Erling Haaland for next season. But it was a quietly crucial win too, for no other reason than because there was no real alternative. Liverpool know deep down that they will probably finish second in this year’s Premier League, and more painfully they know they probably deserve to. Those seven dropped points over Christmas and new year, an entire month without a league win, have likely done for them. Hope is the most precious commodity of all to retain at a time like this. But there are two major finals still to be played and this is no time to start feeling sorry for themselves, as it briefly appeared as if they might. You could even see the fatigue and lethargy in Klopp’s face as he did his post-match interviews: a coach of boundless energy whose tank looks like it has almost run dry. More than ever you sense Liverpool are trying to ration their efforts, spread their resources, chug gamely towards the end of a season that will encompass 63 games in all competitions. The omissions of Andy Robertson, Mohamed Salah and Thiago Alcântara from the starting lineup appeared telling. The injury to Fabinho, who limped off before half-time with a hamstring injury, will stretch them still further. And so, in a strange and scruffy game, disarmingly open in parts, Liverpool were forced to rely on their unlikelier stalwarts. Kostas Tsimikas had a wildly eclectic game at left-back, a juddering high-wire act that generated several misplaced passes, at least two clear positional errors and some crucial tackles and blocks. But his electric surges up the left flank, his willingness to ping the early cross, his restless sense of dramatic tension, were exactly what a tired Liverpool required here after the ice bath of going an early goal down. What was most notable about Douglas Luiz’s third-minute finish was that there were probably about five or six individual duels that led to it – crosses that could have been stopped, tackles or headers that could have been won – and Liverpool lost them all. Villa were lavish in those opening minutes, even after Joël Matip bundled home a quick equaliser, and so what Liverpool really needed was someone who could break the game up, upset Villa’s rhythm and impose one of his own. What they needed, above all, was Keïta. Those of you who may not have been watching too closely probably wrote Keïta off as damaged goods some years ago: probably during one of the many injury layoffs that threatened to curtail his Liverpool career before it had really begun. Even when Keïta managed to work his way to full fitness he found opportunities hard to come by in a midfield increasingly shaped by the metronomic Fabinho and Thiago, a midfield more concerned with controlling games rather than rattling them open. The problem was, in a way, that Keïta was signed to play in a Liverpool midfield that no longer existed. At RB Leipzig, where he played until 2018, he was an expansive, marauding presence, as comfortable dribbling the ball 50 yards through the centre as burgling goals with late runs into the penalty area. The problem was that by the time Keïta arrived, there was no longer much call for any of that. Liverpool were already beginning to pivot away from the sort of concussive, vertical midfield play that he was best at. And yet, four years into his time at Anfield, Keïta is quietly having his best season at the club so far: most appearances, most goals, a pivotal role in Liverpool’s run to the Champions League final. To a large extent this is a question of timing and fitness. But there also seems to be a recognition from Klopp that there are certain games where Liverpool need a little extra unpredictability in the middle: the snapping tackle, the enterprising dribble, the quick 50-yard long ball into space. Keïta is the man you call on when you’re worried things are just getting a little tired, a little stale. So it was fitting that he came to the fore on Tuesday night, in a game where Liverpool were in danger of submitting to their own languor. The limbs are screaming with tiredness, the minds are cooked, there’s a cup final on Saturday and effectively three more after that. Depleted, disheartened, but somehow still fighting: in a way, the story of Keïta is also the story of Liverpool’s season.",Sport/Football,Resurgent Naby Keïta keeps Liverpool going when the limbs are screaming | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/10/resurgent-naby-keita-keeps-liverpool-going-when-the-limbs-are-screaming
5/11/2022,"A UK ticket-holder has won a £184m EuroMillions jackpot, becoming the UK’s biggest ever national lottery winner, Camelot has said. The winning numbers were 3, 25, 27, 28 and 29, plus the Lucky Star numbers 4 and 9. One ticket matched all seven numbers to win a total of £184,262,899.10 in prize money.

5/11/2022,"Jürgen Klopp said he has invited his Liverpool players to follow his lead in shutting out the noise surrounding their title scrap with Manchester City and insists his team are “still chasing like mad” after returning to winning ways at Aston Villa. Sadio Mané’s clever winner cut City’s advantage to just goal difference before they visit Wolves on Wednesday, and Klopp conceded the leaders have signed a “beast” in Erling Haaland. Asked how easy it is for Liverpool not to concern themselves about City, Klopp replied: “For me it is absolutely no problem. I have invited the boys to follow my mindset. We are still chasing like mad. We just know we have to win and now we have to recover and then to play the FA Cup final [on Saturday] because there is no mercy nowhere because of this situation [where we are] qualifying for all finals. We play an incredibly big game and from Thursday on we will prepare.” Douglas Luiz scored early for Villa but Liverpool hit back three minutes later through Joel Matip before Mané’s clever header from Luis Diaz’s cross midway through the second half secured victory. Klopp praised the mentality of his players and Alisson for making a world-class save to deny Danny Ings an equaliser. The manager confirmed Andy Robertson is rested for the final against Chelsea on Saturday, while Fabinho is a doubt after being forced off with a muscle problem. When asked how much stronger Haaland will make City following his £51m move from Borussia Dortmund, Klopp could not help but smile. “A lot,” he said. “City was and will never be a team that wins games because of one player, because of the way the specific way they play. I think Erling will certainly score a lot of goals. He is a real beast. He was injured a couple of times at Dortmund but when he is fit he is a real beast. Unfortunately, he is a really good signing.” The Villa manager and former Liverpool captain, Steven Gerrard, conceded Ings would play missed chances “over in his head on the way home” but was delighted with his side’s display. “We’re slightly frustrated we didn’t score more than once,” said Gerrard, who reiterated his intention to sign Philippe Coutinho on a permanent deal from Barcelona. “We’ve got to take those big moments we created. The big positives for me is that we were brave, courageous and went toe-to-toe with one of the best teams in the world. We knew at times we would have to suffer.”",Sport/Football,Jürgen Klopp says Liverpool ‘still chasing like mad’ for Premier League,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/10/jurgen-klopp-says-liverpool-still-chasing-like-mad-for-premier-league
5/11/2022,"Brendon McCullum, the pioneering former New Zealand captain, has emerged as the favourite to become England’s Test head coach with an announcement on the successful candidate due this week. Rob Key, the director of England men’s cricket, is looking to recruit separate coaches for the Test and white-ball sides, with McCullum among those known to have been first sounded out and then interviewed during the past couple of days. It was widely believed the 40-year-old McCullum’s application would relate to the limited-overs vacancy, given a nascent coaching career spent exclusively in franchise T20 cricket and a close friendship with Eoin Morgan, England’s white-ball captain. But there is now a growing expectation that McCullum may take charge of the Test set-up in a move that would combine his aggressive outlook with the captaincy of Ben Stokes, with a first assignment against New Zealand at Lord’s on 2 June. If so it would mean Gary Kirsten missing out of the role once more, having been runner-up when Chris Silverwood was hired in 2019. That said, the former South Africa and India head coach has a strong reputation for augmenting sides with existing depth and so could yet secure the equivalent position with the white-ball set-up. Paul Collingwood, currently an assistant coach with England, is another being considered for the limited-overs role while the former Australia batsman Simon Katich has similarly been part of a recruitment process that began when Key took charge of the men’s national teams at the start of last month. Appointing McCullum for the Test team would be a bold move by Key and one that will invite questions about the domestic coaching landscape in England, not least since the former wicketkeeper-batter has never coached a first-class side himself. McCullum is, however, widely credited for changing the culture of New Zealand’s Test team as captain between 2013 and 2016 and laying the foundation for the World Test Championship title last year under his successor, Kane Williamson. McCullum is coaching Kolkata Knightriders in the Indian Premier League but Key has said previously he is open to England’s head coach having a second job in the world’s most lucrative T20 tournament if it secures the right candidate.",Sport/Sport,Brendon McCullum favourite to become England’s Test head coach ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/10/brendon-mccullum-favourite-to-become-englands-test-head-coach
