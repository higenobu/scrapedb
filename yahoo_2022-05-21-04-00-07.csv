5/21/2022,"PRAGUE (Reuters) - The Czech Republic is considering ""all options"" concerning its engagement with the China-led 16+1 platform for cooperation with central and east European states, the Foreign Ministry said on Friday. Several past Czech governments as well as President Milos Zeman have been keen to deepen ties with China, but the interest has cooled since a series of failed Chinese investment projects, Czech warnings against Chinese 5G telecoms technology and a change of government in Prague last year. ""The main initiatives of 16+1, economic diplomacy and the promise of massive investments and mutually beneficial trade, are not being fulfilled even after 10 years,"" minister Jan Lipavsky said in comments to news agency CTK, sent by the ministry's spokeswoman to Reuters. The statement followed a Czech lower house of parliament foreign committee's call on the cabinet on Thursday to quit the group. The new Czech centre-right cabinet has pledged to build up relations with democracies including self-ruled Taiwan - which China sees as a breakaway province - and put its China policies under review. ""The unfulfilled promises lead to the consideration of all options of our future role in the platform,"" he said. ""The government, in its manifesto, announced its intention to revise our relations with China. Our approach to 16+1 and its future is a part of this process.""

5/21/2022,"Ukraine's human rights ombudsman said a one-year-old boy was raped by Russian soldiers then died. She said her office gets new reports of sexual violence by Russian soldiers every day. These include cases where minors are raped, she said. A one-year-old boy died after being raped by two Russian soldiers, the Ukrainian Parliament's Commissioner for Human Rights said on Thursday. The accusation is one of the most horrific from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but is not unique. Denisova Liudmyla Leontiivna said in the statement that it gets reports of sexual violence against Ukrainians every day, including against children. Leontiivna did not give further details of what is alleged to have happened, but said that the report had been received in the previous 24 hours. Insider could find no independent evidence for the claim. The majority of new reports were coming from around Kharkiv, she said, though did not give a specific location for the allegation about the one-year-old. Most reports were made by relatives or, for those who did not die, by the victims themselves, she said. Russian forces have this week been withdrawing from the area around Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, which had long been subject to heavy attacks. The commissioner said on Thursday that her office recieved 10 reports of sexual violence in one hour on Thursday, including eight cases of minors being raped. ""I appeal to the UN Commission for Investigation Human Rights Violations during the Russian military invasion of Ukraine to take into account these facts of genocide of the Ukrainian people,"" Leontiivna said. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has repeatedly been described as a genocide by Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and reports of rape have been widespread.

5/21/2022,"Warning: This video may be the cutest thing you have seen in a while. Thank you, Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission for capturing it and making our weekend. On Friday, the agency posted a black and white clip on its Facebook page of a beautiful reunion between a Florida panther and her lost kitten, and then gave followers the back story: Back in March, after the 4-month-old somehow got separated from her mother in Collier County, staffers launched a search in the area, to no avail. The kitten was taken to Naples Zoo and a towel with its scent was placed in the area where it was found. When that didn’t work, biologists then tried to attract the Florida panther with her actual baby, by placing the little one in a cage in the same area. After two days, the FWC was almost about to give up, the agency’s post says. Finally, after the third night, Mom finally appeared. Livestream video captures the sweet moment the adult panther happens upon the cage and the kitten begins to meow loudly in recognition. A biologist opened the cage, the Fish and Wildlife says, and out pops the kitten, scampering over to Mama. “Reunited and it feels so good,” reads the text on screen, referencing the classic “Peaches & Herb” song. Later footage shows the pair together walking, Mini Me tailing closely behind. Though the kitten is wearing an expandable collar in the clips, it will soon drop off, the FWC says, adding both animals will be monitored in case they happen to split up again. The post ends with a reminder that Friday is Endangered Species Day, and the Florida panther’s current status is listed as endangered. There are only about 130 left in the wild.
