2/25/2022,"PRAGUE (AP) — Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has shocked the former Soviet satellite states of Central and Eastern Europe, drawing strong condemnation even from the region’s most pro-Kremlin politicians. For some of the countries that fled the Soviet bloc following a series of anti-communist revolutions more than 30 years ago, footage of tanks and troops rolling in to punish a nation trying to pursue its own independent course looks painfully familiar. Two until now major pro-Russian voices in the European Union, Czech President Milos Zeman and Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban, didn't mince their words in criticizing Moscow’s most aggressive action since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. Their countries experienced comparable brutality — the Czech Republic, as part of Czechoslovakia, in 1968 and Hungary in 1956. Zeman called Thursday's invasion “an unprovoked act of aggression.” “Russia has committed a crime against peace,” he said in an address to the nation. Zeman had previously made news by calling Russia’s 2014 annexation of the Ukrainian Crimean Peninsula “a fait accompli.” Many in the Czech Republic reviled Zeman as a “servant of Kremlin” after he sided with Russia and cast doubt on the findings of his own security and intelligence services on the alleged participation of Russian spies in a huge 2014 ammunition explosion. Until just days ago, Zeman was insisting that the Russians wouldn't attack Ukraine because “they aren’t lunatics to launch an operation that would be more damaging for them than beneficial.” “I admit I was wrong,” he said Thursday. Zeman has called for harsh sanctions against Russia, including cutting it out of the SWIFT financial system which shuffles money from bank to bank around the globe. “It’s necessary to isolate a lunatic and not just to defend ourselves by words but also by deeds,” he said. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala also voiced full support for the strongest possible sanctions for what he called “an absolutely unjustified act of aggression against a sovereign state.” Prague ordered the closure of two Russian consulates in the Czech Republic and stopped accepting visa requests from Russian citizens. Pavel Rychetsky, the chief judge at the Constitutional court, the country’s highest legal authority, suggested that a European arrest warrant should be issued against Russian President Vladimir Putin. He said Putin should be tried at the International Criminal Court for “an unprecedented unleashing of war on the European continent for the first time since World War II.” In Hungary, high ranking officials had for weeks avoided condemning Russia’s actions directly. Under Orban, the country has pursued close ties with Putin, a point of concern for many of Hungary’s western partners. Hungary has historically deeply distrusted Moscow, which ordered the brutal repression of an anti-Soviet uprising in 1956. But Orban in recent years has pursued a diplomatic and economic strategy he calls “Eastern Opening,” which favors closer ties with countries to the east, and in his frequent battles with the EU has called the 27-nation bloc an oppressive imperial power similar to Hungary’s former Soviet occupiers. But on Thursday, Orban was clear in his condemnation of the Kremlin. “Russia attacked Ukraine this morning with military force,” Orban said in a video on Facebook. “Together with our European Union and NATO allies, we condemn Russia’s military action.” “Hungary’s position is clear: we stand by Ukraine, we stand by Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty,” his Foreign Minister Peter Szijijarto said. Bulgaria, Moscow’s closest ally during the Cold War, followed suit. “Having strategic bombers and missiles flying in Europe in the 21st century, assaults by air and sea against a sovereign state, is absolutely inadmissible,” President Rumen Radev said. Romania also stood staunchly with its western partners. “Through today’s cynical invasion, the Russian Federation is the architect of the worst security crisis since World War II,” the ruling coalition leaders said. Neighboring Moldova, a former Soviet republic and one of the few former communist Eastern European countries not to have joined NATO so far, echoed these views. Moldovan President Maia Sandu stressed that Russia’s attacks were launched “in violation of international norms,” adding that the international community “unanimously condemns these military actions.” ___ Justin Spike in Budapest, Hungary, Veselin Toskov in Sofia, Bulgaria and Stephen McGrath in Bucharest, Romania, contributed. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the Ukraine crisis at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",World/Associated Press,"By invading Ukraine, Putin loses allies in eastern Europe",https://news.yahoo.com/invading-ukraine-putin-loses-allies-201605774.html
2/25/2022,"A Chinese news outlet appears to have accidentally leaked its own censorship instructions in its coverage of the Russia-Ukraine crisis.

According to a now-deleted Weibo post, Horizon News, which operates under China’s state-owned outlet Beijing News, said that comments and reports deemed unfavorable to Russia or favorable to the West cannot be published.
 


The post appears to have made rounds on Tuesday morning. Eagle-eyed users managed to take screenshots and spread them on various online platforms before the original Weibo post was deleted.

China and Russia have no formal military alliance. However, they have strengthened their economic relations in recent years, becoming main trade partners.

In September 2021, Beijing supplied Moscow with computers, heating machinery, automobile parts, telephones and electric heaters, according to data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC). In turn, Moscow provided crude petroleum, refined petroleum, coal briquettes, sawn wood and gas turbines.

During the opening of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin declared that their “friendship” has “no limits” and “no ‘forbidden’ areas of cooperation,” according to Reuters. Additionally, Putin affirmed his opposition to Taiwan’s independence.

Russia, which launched its invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, is now facing an increasing amount of sanctions from multiple governments. But while most of the world has denounced Russia for its actions against Ukraine, China has yet to publicly denounce the transcontinental country.

“Simply put, China has to back Russia up with emotional and moral support while refraining from treading on the toes of the United States and European Union,” wrote Ming Jinwei, senior editor at China’s Xinhua News Agency, according to The Washington Post.

“In the future, China will also need Russia’s understanding and support when wrestling with America to solve the Taiwan issue once and for all,” he added.

2/25/2022,"SURING - The school nurse who helped conduct a strip search of students at Suring High School to find vaping devices contacted her supervisor the next day because she was concerned the searches were inappropriate, according to police records. The nurse told investigators she contacted her supervisor, a nurse with an unnamed clinic, Jan. 19 because she was concerned about searches she helped Suring School District Superintendent Kelly Casper conduct the day before, according to Oconto County Sheriff’s Office reports obtained by USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin through an open records request. Suring High School administrators have not yet responded to a call for comment. The school nurse, who was involved in strip-searching students at Suring High School, started her job the day before the searches took place and wasn’t given paperwork or guidance on how to do her job, according to police reports. The name of the clinic and the supervisor were redacted, whitened out, in the reports released by the sheriff's office. More: 'We're not done by a long shot.' Moms express anger on Suring High strip searches as DA, sheriff conflict More: DA confirms case not reopened in Suring school strip search; school board meets to discuss 'employment issue' The supervisor told the nurse the searches were improper per school district policy, and she shouldn’t talk to anyone except law enforcement about them, according to police reports. The supervisor told the school nurse that she would contact the clinic's legal team and start an investigation. Suring School District policy states ""under no circumstances shall a school official ever conduct a strip search of a student."" State statute says any official, employee or agent of a school district who conducts a strip search is guilty of a Class B misdemeanor. The school nurse said she hadn't talked to anyone, including her family, about what happened, according police reports. Parents of the students say the district never notified them about the strip searches in advance, and several have since hired a civil law attorney. The school nurse told investigators that soon after she started working at Suring High School on Jan. 17, Casper came into her office and said “I’m going to have to search the girls,” and asked the nurse if she would be able to help and witness that she didn’t touch any students. The next day, Casper began calling students into the district office to be searched. According to police reports, the nurse stood outside of a bathroom in the nurse’s office as Casper searched the girls one by one for vapes. The girls told investigators the nurse stood by the door while Casper conducted the search. Oconto County District Attorney Edward D. Burke Jr. decided not to charge administrators with a crime earlier this month, saying state law hadn’t been broken because no private parts were exposed. However, police reports show at least one student said she was made to pull her bra away from their body while Casper searched her for vapes. Casper told investigators the nurse made one girl pull her bra away from her body. Casper couldn’t remember which student it was, but said it was only one student, and it was the nurse who told them to pull their bra outward not up. Casper’s statement is at odds with the student’s version of events, who told investigators that Casper told her to lift her bra and her breasts were exposed. The girl told investigators that two of her friends were made to do the same thing. A statement released by Burke earlier this month said Casper and the nurse, both women, searched six female students for vape cartridges Jan. 17 and 18. Casper made the students undress to their underwear and searched them. Burke said the searches did not fit the definition of strip searches under state statute because the students' private parts were not exposed to Casper and the nurse. Burke has not denied the incident occurred, only that it did not meet the legal definition of a strip search. ""I think the charging decision as far as what I had was pretty spot on because it didn’t fit the statutory criteria of strip search,"" Burke said in an interview Monday. ""You can call it a strip search just based upon the facts — common sense would say that. But the law and common sense are sometimes very far apart."" Suring High School Principal Zachary Beeksma also started working for the district shortly before the searches took place. He began at the beginning of January after working as a teacher at Nathan Hale High School in West Allis, according to police records. Contact Jake Prinsen at jprinsen@gannett.com.

2/25/2022,"Many in Russia are shocked to see President Vladimir Putin escalate the country's conflict with Ukraine to a full-scale war, reports The New York Times. Even though Moscow's invasion of Ukraine was not entirely surprising after weeks of increasing military presence along the border, many analysts say some of Putin's strategy is seemingly out of character. ""A number of people in Moscow's foreign policy establishment, where analysts overwhelmingly characterized Mr. Putin's military buildup around Ukraine as an elaborate and astute bluff in recent months, admitted on Thursday that they had monumentally misjudged a man they had spent decades studying,"" writes the Times. Several prominent pundits in Russia had written off the idea of war as ridiculous given Putin's past handling of conflict. One notable change, experts told the Times, is Putin's demeanor after two years of the global pandemic. After Putin's long-term dedication to self-isolating, he ""appeared to become more aggrieved and more emotional, and increasingly spoke about his mission in stark historical terms."" Political scientist Gleb O. Pavlovsky, who was once a close adviser to Putin, said ""he's become an isolated man, more isolated than Stalin was,"" and described being stunned by Putin's ""dark description of Ukraine as a dire threat to Russia,"" per the Times. Another political analyst, Tatiana Stanovaya, agreed Putin has ""become less pragmatic, and more emotional."" After years of projecting calm strength, she and much of the ""ruling elite around"" Putin were astounded by the ""shift"" away from pragmatic strategy. Stanovaya said even Putin's inner circle did not realize Russia was actually hurtling toward war until it was too late. Read more at The New York Times.
