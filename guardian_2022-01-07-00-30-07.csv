1/7/2022,"A French rally driver seriously injured in an explosion in Jeddah last week has emerged from a coma, while his team have claimed Saudi Arabian authorities are trying to cover up the cause of the incident. Philippe Boutron sustained serious injuries in the blast outside a hotel near Jeddah’s international airport a week ago. The explosion damaged a support vehicle he was driving for the Sodicars Racing team that was competing in the Dakar rally.  Boutron was flown back to France where he was placed in a medically induced coma from which he emerged on Thursday, according to his son. Saudi police earlier announced there was no evidence that the explosion was criminal, but a rally official insisted a “malicious act” had not been ruled out. French anti-terrorism investigators have opened a preliminary inquiry into “multiple attempted killings as part of a terrorist group”. Saudi authorities have not commented on the announcement. A Sodicars press spokesperson told French journalists: “We must tell the truth. It was an attack, and not an accident as the Saudi authorities are trying to maintain. There was a bomb in the side rail of the vehicle, under the pedals.” Richard Gonzalez, the head of Sodicars Racing, who was at the scene very shortly after the blast, said: “At first we thought something had hit the car, but there was a significant impact under the car’s chassis. There was a charge under the side of the car that exploded. I was there, I have the photos, I saw everything. It was a deliberate act, there’s no doubt about that. “When we saw the car, we thought something wasn’t quite right, but our priority was to get Philippe out and to hospital. He had suffered serious injuries to his legs. He’s a driver and a client but above all he’s been a friend for 10 years. It’s terrible.” The Dakar rally, usually from Paris to the Senegalese capital, was first held in 1978. It has taken place in Saudi Arabia since 2020 for security reasons. Last Thursday, 48 hours before the first stage of the race was to begin, the Sodicars vehicle was “brought to a sudden halt by a sudden explosion” as it was leaving the hotel, the rally organisers ASO (Amaury Sport Organisation) said. Five Sodicars rally team members in the vehicle escaped but Boutron, 61, who was driving the car, sustained serious injury to his legs. Boutron, a marketing executive and also president of the French Ligue 2 football team Orléans, was due to take part in his ninth Dakar rally. After the blast he underwent several operations in Saudi Arabia before being flown to France for further emergency treatment at the Clamart military hospital near Paris. Boutron’s son Benoît, a journalist with the French radio station RMC Sport, told Radio Monte Carlo: “He is indeed seriously injured on both legs. We will know more in 10 days but we must remain cautious at this stage.” He denied reports that Boutron’s legs may have to be amputated. “With this kind of accident you have to take things step by step. Already he’s come out of the coma. We’re lucky to be able to visit him daily,” Benoît said. ASO has said investigations are continuing and nothing has been ruled out, “including a malicious act”. It did not wish to comment further. France’s foreign affairs ministry has advised French nationals to exercise “maximum vigilance” in Saudi Arabia. A spokesperson said it had not been ruled out that the explosion was a “criminal act”, and added: “There’s still a terrorist threat in Saudi Arabia.”",News/World news,French Dakar rally driver out of coma as team says bomb caused blast,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/french-dakar-rally-driver-out-of-coma-as-team-says-bomb-caused-blast
1/7/2022,"Hello, and happy Thursday (and 2022), Over the last few days, I’ve been reporting on Republicans’ efforts to exert partisan control over election administration and the counting of votes, a new and deeply alarming anti-democratic trend.  One year after the 6 January attack on the US Capitol, a staggering number of Republicans continue to believe the election was stolen. A recent UMass Amherst poll, for example, found that 71% of Republicans, and 33% of Americans overall, do not think the 2020 election was legitimate. Other polls from CNN and Reuters/Ipsos have similar findings. Even though officials have described the 2020 election as the most secure in modern history, it’s easy to see why the belief that the election was fraudulent continues to be so pervasive. Republican politicians across the country have embraced the idea and refused to publicly affirm Biden’s win. In turn they’ve capitalized on the lack of confidence they’ve created, passing laws to impose new restrictions on voting access, saying they’re needed to shore up voter confidence. Jessica Marsden, a lawyer at Protect Democracy who tracks state bills permitting election interference, told me something this week on this point that stuck with me. She noted that in 2020, there was a push from Trump and his allies to get legislatures to convene special sessions to throw out the results of the popular vote in their state and appoint their own set of electors. In the end, key Republicans in places like Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania were unwilling to go along with it. Marsden thinks the reason that effort didn’t succeed was not because of legal barriers but because of politics. Republican politicians were wary of blowback from discarding votes. “In both Arizona and Georgia, you had the governors not willing to go along with that game, they would have been doing that quite explicitly to throw out the vote of their own constituents,” she said. “What the disinformation campaign does is try to lower the political cost of throwing out election results by creating a lot of uncertainty about what the true results were.” That lowering of the political cost may be Republicans’ biggest achievement over the last year. The idea that politicians may need to step in and toss out legitimate votes is no longer a fringe idea, but instead one that has moved to the center of our political discourse. Combined with more explicit legislation to exert partisan influence over election administration – 32 bills became law in 17 states last year – Republicans have created a uniquely powerful threat to America’s democracy. “Just as gerrymandering and Republicans trying to make voting harder have been baked into our expectations of democracy, it won’t be long until we just accept that Republicans will try to overturn elections they lost,” Matt Fuller writes in a haunting piece for the Daily Beast. “To not do so, to affirm an election that hands power to a Democrat, will become treachery in the GOP. That’s really where we’re headed – if we’re not already there.” Please continue to write to me each week with your questions about elections and voting at sam.levine@theguardian.com or DM me on Twitter at @srl and I’ll try to answer as many as I can. Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, pledged there will be a vote on changing the filibuster rules by 17 January to pass voting rights legislation. It’s unclear if Democrats will have enough support to change the rules. A group of prominent election law scholars wrote an op-ed laying out how Congress can fix the Electoral Count Act, a confusing 19th-century law that Trump and allies tried to rely on to overturn the 2020 election. The law has remained unchanged since last year. Texas quietly released the results of the first part of a review of the 2020 election on New Year’s Eve. Officials didn’t find much. A Minnesota prosecutor is bringing criminal charges against a man who requested an absentee ballot in 2020 while on probation for a felony, but who never voted. California authorities completed a months-long investigation into a man who was found passed out with 300 absentee ballots last summer, and said there was no evidence he intended to commit election fraud.",News/US news,Republicans’ anti-democratic attacks are the new normal,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/06/republicans-anti-democratic-attacks
1/7/2022,"In the decades after the second world war it was the music of Anton Webern, rather than that of his teacher Arnold Schoenberg, that provided the starting point for the revolution launched by the composers of the European avant garde. Yet despite its influence, Webern’s slender output was rarely performed then, and even more rarely recorded. It did not become more widely accessible until the American conductor Robert Craft directed this series of recordings, made in Los Angeles between 1954 and 1956, using an unidentified orchestra made up, presumably, of Hollywood session musicians, and west coast-based soloists, including the soprano Marni Nixon and pianist Leonard Stein.  Craft now is best remembered as Igor Stravinsky’s assistant, author of the books of their conversations and credited with encouraging the composer to adopt serial techniques in his later years. But his Webern recordings proved hugely influential; for those of us growing up in the 1960s and 70s, Craft’s LPs provided almost the only way of getting to know these jewel-like works, until in 1979 Pierre Boulez released the first of what would be his two complete surveys. Craft launched a second series of Webern recordings in 2009 for Naxos, left unfinished at his death, while until this reissue his pioneering efforts from more than half a century earlier had never been transferred to CD. The set includes all the works with opus numbers, as well as Webern’s iridescent orchestration of the Ricercar from Bach’s Musical Offering and just one of the early, pre-opus pieces, the Piano Quintet of 1907 – just under three hours’ music altogether. (The second of Boulez’s surveys, released in 2000 and running to six discs, includes much more of the “prehistoric” music, though by no means all of it.) There’s no doubt that Webern interpretation has moved on since Craft made these discs, not only thanks to Boulez’s work, but through recordings by other conductors (especially Karajan, Sinopoli and Dohnányi) too. The cool, rigorous beauty and impacted lyricism they reveal in this music can only be sensed occasionally in these performances. It’s all too obvious that this music was terra incognita to these musicians; there’s a dogged caution and lack of expression in much of the playing and singing, not helped by the dryness of the recording. But in the orchestral works Craft shows that he at least understands what the essence of Webern’s music is; in the Passacaglia Op 1, the two sets of orchestral pieces, Op 6 and Op 10, and the Variations Op 30, the raw-edged fierceness and cut-glass precision seem authentic. But it’s more an issue of historical than of musical significance; the limitations in the performances of the smaller-scale works make this a set for specialists. Those looking for a Webern survey for their collection should opt for one of the Boulez sets.",Arts/Music,The Complete Music of Anton Webern review | Andrew Clements's classical album of the week,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/06/the-complete-music-of-anton-webern-review-hugely-influential-recordings-of-jewel-like-works
1/7/2022,"Dozens of protesters and at least 12 police have died during the ongoing violence in Kazakhstan, authorities claimed, as “peacekeepers” from a Russian-led military alliance arrived in the country at the request of the embattled president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. Eyewitnesses in Almaty, Kazakhstan’s largest city, described scenes of chaos on Thursday, with government buildings stormed or set on fire and widespread looting. However, many of those demonstrating said the protests had started out peaceful earlier in the week, and turned violent after a heavy-handed government response.  The interior ministry said 2,000 people were arrested on Thursday, while the police spokesperson Saltanat Azirbek told state news channel Khabar-24 that “dozens of attackers were liquidated”. There were also reports of about 400 people in hospital. City officials in Almaty said 353 police officers had been injured and 12 killed, one of whom they claimed had been found beheaded. It was not immediately possible to verify the figures, but video footage showed violent clashes between protesters and authorities in a number of different cities. Local journalist Ardak Bukeeva, who spent Thursday speaking with protesters in central Almaty, said demonstrators who stormed the presidential residence in the city told her that dozens of people had been killed during the assault. Many protesters said they had been prompted to come out earlier in the week due to long-simmering frustrations with the political and economic situation in the country, Bukeeva said. However, on Wednesday, the situation turned violent, with some claiming provocateurs had arrived to deliberately cause trouble, and others noting that police were almost entirely absent from the city centre. Irina Mednikova, a civil society activist in Almaty, said she saw large pools of blood in the grass around the presidential residence in the city on Thursday morning, and an absence of security forces or police. “The residence was completely burned. The gates had been rammed open with cars or tractors, all the glass was broken, and inside there was smoke and a terrible smell of burning,” she said. Internet and mobile phone reception was down in most of the country for much of Thursday, with only state television available to most Kazakhs to receive news about the protests. Wild rumours spread by word of mouth, and it was difficult to verify claims. Later on Thursday, news agencies reported renewed gunfire in Almaty and military vehicles on the move in the city. State television claimed an “anti-terrorist operation” was under way. “The terrorists are using civilians, including women, as human shields. The police forces are trying their best to ensure the security of city residents,” state-controlled Khabar 24 told its viewers. Events have escalated quickly since the protests started over a rise in fuel prices in the west of the country over the weekend. They quickly spread, and by Tuesday thousands of people came into the streets in Almaty. Valeria Ibrayeva, an art historian who watched the protest from her window overlooking one of Almaty’s main thoroughfares, said by telephone that on Tuesday the crowds were “friendly and smiling, without aggression and with lots of hope”. However, by Wednesday there were attempts to overturn a bus on the street, and widespread looting of shops, she said. On Wednesday morning, Tokayev declared a state of emergency and accepted the resignation of the government. He also said he was replacing Nursultan Nazarbayev, who ran the country from its independence in 1991 until 2019, as head of the security council. However, these moves failed to quell the unrest, and late on Wednesday Tokayev appealed for the intervention from the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) – an alliance made up of Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The request was swiftly approved and Russian paratroopers arrived in Kazakhstan on Thursday. The decision to intervene came just hours after Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson said there should be no foreign interference in Kazakhstan. The Russian defence ministry published images of Russian troops boarding military aircraft on their way to Kazakhstan. Russian MP Leonid Kalashnikov told Interfax the troops would stay “for as long as the president of Kazakhstan believes it necessary”. He said they would mainly be engaged in protecting “infrastructure” in the country. While it is clear that the protests have been accompanied by violence and looting, there is no evidence that foreign-trained “terrorists” are involved, as Tokayev has claimed. It is also striking that Tokayev felt he could not rely on Kazakhstan’s extensive security resources alone to put down the revolt, and suggests he may have felt unable to count on the loyalty of his forces. Radio Azattyq, the Kazakh service of Radio Liberty, reported unrest in cities across the country. In Aktobe, protesters had got together to defend the airport and railway station, insisting they did not want violence and demanding negotiations with authorities. In other cities there were burned out cars, a shutdown in public infrastructure and panic as people could not withdraw money from banks and found their cards did not work due to the banking system closing down. In the town of Taldykorgan, protesters pulled down a monument to Nazarbayev on Wednesday. The former president, who has the official title Leader of the Nation, has not surfaced in public since the protests began, and there were rumours on Thursday he and his family may have fled the country. Western countries, who were already on high alert over a potential Russian attack on Ukraine, looked on with unease, aware there was little they could do to influence events in Kazakhstan. “Any forces deployed must have a clear mission and act proportionately in any use of force to defend the legitimate security interests in Kazakhstan,” said the British foreign secretary, Liz Truss.

1/7/2022,"Just under three weeks before the Taliban reached Kabul and took control of Afghanistan, 50 of the most powerful women in the country gathered outdoors in a shady spot to discuss how to deal with the approaching danger. Wearing colourful headscarves, some took notes while others listened intently to Fawzia, 48, one of the most senior female judges in Afghanistan. Holding a microphone, she spoke with urgency about the advancing threat and the need to protect the rights that female lawyers, women’s rights activists and journalists had spent decades fighting for.  But they had no idea quite how quickly their precious freedoms were going to be lost. Fawzia and her family escaped from Afghanistan via Tbilisi, Georgia, after the main Operation Pitting airlifts had concluded. They are now being accommodated in a hotel in London under Arap – the UK government’s Afghan relocations and assistance policy. Unlike asylum seekers, the Afghan families are treated more like tourists or business travellers. They are also not constrained by burly security guards standing with folded arms in front of the hotel entrance. Fawzia, her lawyer husband and their four children – aged 18, 16, 11 and nine – say they are very grateful for the sanctuary that has been offered them, and add that the British government has been very kind. But they do not know what the future holds. Like other Afghans brought to safety, they have been granted six months leave to remain in the UK. Details of what will happen after that are not known. Fawzia is energetically networking with other female Afghan judges and human rights defenders in exile, along with prominent female lawyers in the UK such as Helena Kennedy, to try to secure a safe exit for those who have not yet managed to escape. She is becoming increasingly anxious about the female judges still stranded in Afghanistan – she believes that while hundreds have escaped 93 remain there. “The situation for these women is getting worse all the time,” she says. News that eligibility criteria for the Arap scheme are tightening fills her with dread, and she is urging international governments to do more to rescue women still in hiding in her home country. “We must ensure they can be brought to safety,” she said. Fawzia says she has parents to thank for inspiring her to aim high and fight for what she believes in. Her father was a successful scientist with his own factory and the family lived in a large and comfortable home in Kabul. “When the Taliban was in control of everything the first time in the 1990s I did not leave our home for five years. It was a dark and sad time – women and girls lost all their rights,” she says. “I spent my time studying and growing vegetables like tomatoes and peppers in the garden.” Both her parents emphasised the importance of girls getting a good education and a career. “By the time I was eight or nine years old I knew I wanted to be a lawyer,” she said. “My mother’s advice to me for when I was grown up was: ‘Stand on your own two feet, don’t stand on your husband’s feet.’” After qualifying as a judge, Fawzia worked with her government’s ministry of women’s affairs and introduced groundbreaking protections for women and girls including safe houses for women so they could escape from violent husbands, and protections against forced and child marriages. Although life in Kabul after the Americans and the British drove the Taliban out after 9/11 offered more opportunities to women, things were still very dangerous for women like Fawzia who challenged the status quo. “All the time I was in danger in my work,” she said. “And so were the women I was trying to help. One time a violent man came to the court with a gun to shoot his wife who was trying to get justice for things he had done to her. As he pointed the gun at his wife I hit his hands to direct the gun away from his wife. The bullet missed her and she survived. “Another time I was in the car with one of my children who was just six months old. Some people tried to kidnap my baby. I hid her under the seat to save her.” “Everything is lost for women in Afghanistan,” she said. “The situation for them is much worse now than it was soon after the Taliban took over.” She is determined to continue raising her voice for her sisters who are in peril just as she did in Afghanistan. Her focus is on building the international network to support the women left behind. For her family’s future in London she is hopeful and optimistic. “In Kabul we lived in a big house. But now it doesn’t matter if we have a big house or a small house. For the first time since the Taliban took over Afghanistan I felt safe and slept well when we arrived in the UK. Here we can start again.”",News/World news,The Afghan judge working to free her sisters left behind,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/the-afghan-judge-working-to-free-her-sisters-left-behind
1/7/2022,"The UK government is facing legal action over its decision to keep using a Malaysian company accused of using forced labour as a supplier of personal protective equipment (PPE) to the NHS. Lawyers at the London-based law firm Wilson Solicitors have filed for a judicial review of the government’s decision to name the UK subsidiary of the Malaysian company Supermax as one of the approved suppliers in a new £6bn contract for disposable gloves for NHS workers.  Supermax has faced persistent allegations of the use of forced labour involving its migrant workforce at factories in Malaysia since 2019. In October 2021, the US banned imports from Supermax after an investigation found “ample evidence” of forced labour. Canada halted federal imports in November 2021, also due to concerns over labour abuses. In 2019 Supermax workers claimed they had to work 30 days in a row without a day off and had paid high fees in their home countries to get the jobs. The company denied the allegations. After the US ban, the UK government launched its own investigation into the allegations of modern slavery and forced labour concerning Supermax. But in December 2021 Supermax was named as one of the approved suppliers able to pitch for contracts under the NHS’s new “framework agreement” for the purchase of surgical gloves. Wilson Solicitors, which is acting for a group of Supermax workers, said it had asked the NHS to reconsider its decision to continue awarding contracts to the company, arguing that public procurement legislation in the UK allowed for the authorities to discontinue relationships with suppliers on the basis of evidence of labour abuses. It said it found the government’s response “inadequate” and so is proceeding with the judicial review. “The legal requirements are clear that there should be real verification of suppliers before the award stage, but it is not clear that these necessities have been met,” said Nusrat Uddin, a solicitor at Wilson. “It is inadequate for the government to carry out due diligence after the award stage, their approach undermines the UK’s claims that they are world-leading in the fight against modern slavery and highlights the weakness in their own legislation, policies and practices,” she said. The case is due to be heard at the high court on Friday. Wilson said it was the first time that the UK government had faced legal action under public procurement legislation. Supermax has provided hundreds of millions of gloves via the NHS to hospital doctors and nurses. In 2020, it received a Covid-19 contract worth £316m. The latest order placed with Supermax was in July 2021 for 135m gloves at a cost of £7.9m, according to the Department of Health and Social Care. A government spokesperson from the Department of Health and Social Care, which oversees the NHS, said: “We have made strong commitments to eradicate modern slavery from all contracts in the government supply chain. “We take any allegations of this nature very seriously and do not hesitate to investigate claims made against manufacturers. A proper due-diligence process is carried out for all contracts and our suppliers are required to follow the highest legal and ethical standards. We cannot comment further at this stage.” Malaysia produces nearly two-thirds of the world’s disposable gloves. During the pandemic, the NHS also provided UK hospitals with millions of gloves from Brightway and Top Glove, which have faced accusations of labour abuses from some of their workers. Supermax did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment but said in a statement that it had implemented a new foreign worker policy in November 2021, which would “speed up the process” of meeting the International Labour Organization’s labour standards. It also said it had raised its minimum wage, was repaying recruitment fees to some former workers, and was working on an equal pay structure to eliminate discriminatory practices.",News/Global development,UK faces legal action for approving firm accused of using forced labour as PPE supplier,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/06/uk-faces-legal-action-for-approving-firm-accused-of-using-forced-labour-as-ppe-supplier
1/7/2022,"Warnings of widespread travel disruption and tricky driving conditions have been issued as snow, sleet and rain swept across large parts of the UK on Thursday. The warnings came as a big chill enveloped all four nations. A temperature of -8C was recorded on Thursday morning in the village of Topcliffe, North Yorkshire, making it the coldest night in England of the winter so far, the Met Office said.  Richard Miles, a Met Office spokesperson, said wintry snow showers were possible everywhere from mid-Wales upwards, with northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland bearing the brunt. Blustery conditions would make the temperatures feel colder for many throughout the day and night as air from the Canadian Arctic swept across the UK, he said. Four Met Office yellow warnings for the west of Northern Ireland, northern England and much of Scotland were in place on Thursday, all of them cautioning about snow, sleet, ice and difficult travel conditions which were likely to continue into Friday morning. The alerts included warnings of thundersnow in Scotland, a relatively uncommon phenomenon. “It is just thunder when it’s snowing,” Miles said. “It happens for the same reason that thunder and lightning happens in the summer, it’s to do with the temperature gradient. It is the same mechanisms but it sounds and looks slightly different in snowy conditions.” The Met Office says the phenomenon is meteorologically identical to the thunder and lightning storms that take place in summer, just with snow instead of rain or hail. This means it can look and sound different. Lightning reflecting off snowflakes appears brighter, and the thunder is muffled by snow drifts. During a summer storm, the thunder can be heard many miles away, but during a thundersnow event it will only be heard if you are within 2-3 miles of it. Thundersnow is rarer than regular thunderstorms, since elevated convection – moist air rising into the troposphere to produce thunderstorms – rarely happens at temperatures that support snowfall.Thunderstorms develop when a front of warm air collides with colder air making the atmosphere unstable. As warm air rises it cools and condenses, forming small droplets of water to create a cumulonimbus cloud in less than an hour. As the warm air continues to rise, the water droplets form ice crystals, and circulating air in the clouds causes water  to freeze on the surface of the droplet or crystal. Eventually, the droplets become too heavy to be supported by the updraughts of air and they fall as hail. Lightning is formed when the negative charge of the hail rubs against smaller, positively charged ice crystals and they discharge in a flash of lightning. The rapid expansion and heating of air caused by the lightning produces the accompanying loud clap of thunder. Miles said there was a small risk of power cuts or mobile phone coverage issues because of the weather conditions. The weather was affecting some ferry services in Scotland, including one of the busiest routes, between Ardrossan, in north Ayrshire, and Brodick, on the Isle of Arran. They were cancelled on Thursday and are expected to resume at 8.20am on Friday. Sailings to the islands of Coll, Tiree, Iona and to Armadale on Skye were also cancelled due to strong winds and swell conditions. Traffic Scotland tweeted safety tips for drivers. The wintry conditions follow an unseasonably mild new year, with record temperatures as high as 16.5C in Bala, Wales, on New Year’s Eve. “We are back to what you would expect in the winter,” Miles said. “It is more like average temperatures.” The yellow warnings are in place until late morning on Friday, with the weekend weather across the UK expected to be unsettled and changeable.",News/UK news,"UK weather: travel warnings issued amid snow, sleet and rain",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/06/uk-weather-travel-warnings-issued-amid-snow-sleet-and-rain
1/7/2022,"A rare case of bird flu has been detected in a person living in south-west England, health officials have confirmed. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said the unnamed person acquired the infection from close and regular contact with a large number of infected birds, which they kept in and around their home over a prolonged period of time.  Bird-to-human transmission of avian flu is very rare and has only occurred a small number of times in the UK previously. All contacts of the person, including those who visited the premises, have been traced and there is no evidence of onward spread of the infection to anyone else, the UKHSA said. The infected person is currently well and self-isolating, while the risk to the wider public from avian flu remains very low. Prof Isabel Oliver, the chief scientific officer at UKHSA, said: “Currently there is no evidence that this strain detected in the UK can spread from person to person, but we know that viruses evolve all the time and we continue to monitor the situation closely. We have followed up all of this individual’s contacts and have not identified any onward spread. “It remains critical that people do not touch sick or dead birds, and that they follow the Defra [Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] advice about reporting.” The case comes after a large number of outbreaks of the H5N1 strain of avian flu in birds across the UK, with alerts having been issued to bird owners. The UK’s chief veterinary officer, Christine Middlemiss, said: “We are seeing a growing number of cases in birds on both commercial farms and in backyard flocks across the country. Implementing scrupulous biosecurity measures will help keep your birds safe.” Prof Mike Tildesley, a professor in infectious disease modelling at the University of Warwick, said: “This is clearly going to be big news but the key thing is that human infections with H5N1 are really rare and they almost always occur as a result of direct, long-term contact with poultry. There has never been any evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of H5N1 so at present I wouldn’t consider this to be a significant public health risk.”",News/World news,Rare bird flu case detected in person in south-west England,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/rare-bird-flu-case-detected-in-person-in-south-west-england
1/7/2022,"Downing Street has ruled out delaying a tax rise this April despite increasing concern among Tory MPs and cabinet ministers over the toll on voters of the cost of living. However, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said on Thursday that the Treasury was examining ways of mitigating the impact of soaring energy prices on consumers when the price cap is reviewed in February, effective from April.  Boris Johnson’s spokesperson said there were no plans to delay the 1.25 percentage point rise in national insurance, which is expected to raise £12bn. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the House of Commons leader, is understood to have asked Sunak during Wednesday’s cabinet meeting to reconsider the increase. “I think it’s important not to lose sight of what the national insurance measure seeks to achieve,” the spokesperson said. “We know that one of the public’s main priorities … is the backlog in our NHS. That’s their priority and that’s what we will deliver on. “In the longer term it will also tackle another fundamental issue left aside for too long, which is the unfairness in our current social care system. Those are two key priorities that need to be funded. We’re doing that in a fair and progressive way. And that’s why we are taking this approach.” The Treasury is understood to be examining targeted measures to help vulnerable consumers with higher bills, such as extending the warm homes discount, but Sunak is thought to be sceptical of cutting VAT. Speaking at a vaccination centre in Haywards Heath, the chancellor said there were a number of measures already in place. “Of course I understand people’s anxiety and concern about energy bills in particular,” he said. “Of course we’re always listening, making sure the policy we’ve got will support people in the way we want it to, and that’s what our track record over the last year or two shows.” For example, he said, the government had increased the national living wage in the spring and reduced the universal credit taper rate, as well as helped towards bills for pensioners and vulnerable families. But Rees-Mogg’s intervention is likely to reignite debate in the party over the national insurance rise. Before Christmas, Lord Frost resigned from the Cabinet citing high taxation, as well as Covid policy. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said the tax decision had been taken and would go ahead. “We’ve made our decisions. We have a collective responsibility,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. During questions in the Commons, the shadow Commons leader, Thangam Debbonaire, teased Rees-Mogg about his intervention, saying scrapping the tax was “something we have been calling for since it was announced … I wonder – is he about to cross the floor?.” Rees-Mogg did not respond directly but said Labour’s call to end VAT on fuel was only possible because of Brexit. “If we were still in the megalithic state that she used to so campaign for … we would not be able to cut VAT on fuel.”",News/Politics,Downing Street rules out delaying April tax rise despite Rees-Mogg intervention,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/06/downing-street-rules-out-delaying-april-tax-rise-despite-rees-mogg-intervention
1/7/2022,"Millions of people have been given financial breathing space after HM Revenue and Customs effectively extended the tax self-assessment deadline by a month, until 28 February. HMRC is postponing late-payment penalties for self-assessment taxpayers until 1 April because it “recognises the pressure” individuals and businesses are facing because of Covid-19.  The move – a repeat of concessions made last year – is good news for the estimated 5.7 million people who have still not filed their 2020-21 tax return. Almost 6.5 million people have already done so. The official deadline for completing a return is 31 January, after which a £100 late-filing penalty would be automatically imposed. HMRC said the deadline to file a return and pay any due tax was still 31 January, but it was waiving late-filing penalties for one month to give more time to taxpayers and accountants who might be struggling. As a result, those who file late will not be hit with a penalty, provided their return is submitted by 28 February. In addition, anyone who cannot pay their self-assessment tax by the deadline will not face a late-payment penalty, provided they pay in full or set up a so-called “time to pay” arrangement – which lets people spread their payments – by 1 April. Normally a 5% late-payment penalty is charged on any unpaid tax that is still outstanding on 3 March. But HMRC said interest would be payable from 1 February, as usual, “so it is still better to pay on time if possible”. Dawn Register, head of tax dispute resolution at the accountant BDO, said: “This is a very welcome move by HMRC … This will be a huge relief to those facing tax bills alongside other household debts in January. “HMRC clearly understands that those severely impacted by Covid-19 should not face receiving a ‘brown envelope’ in February as it would result in unnecessary angst.” Kevin Sefton at tax app Untied said: “The current Covid wave will be affecting not just those who need to file, but accountants and others supporting the 51% of filers who use an adviser, and HMRC themselves.”",Lifestyle/Money,HMRC effectively extends self-assessment deadline by a month,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/06/hmrc-extends-self-assessment-deadline-month-covid-19
1/7/2022,"Environmental activists who accused police of intimidation and harassment have had a review decision in their favour withdrawn in controversial circumstances. The decision, produced by the office of the police and crime commissioner for Devon and Cornwall, was particularly critical of Project Servator, a national anti-terrorism strategy, describing it, “increasingly being used as an intimidatory and oppressive national policing tactic”.  Officials have admitted that the withdrawal of a review which was highly critical of the policing of an incident during environmental protests at last year’s G7 summit in Cornwall “is a rare occurrence”. Rob Higgs, co-founder of Ocean Rebellion, an organisation dedicated to the protection of oceans, which works to try to halt the destruction of marine biodiversity and to repair it, lodged a complaint with Devon and Cornwall police’s professional standards department about what he claimed was intimidation and harassment during police raids at a quarry and at a boatyard on 12 May last year, a month before the G7 summit in Cornwall. He said the police actions were particularly concerning in the light of government plans to curb the right to peaceful protest in the current policing bill. Officers from Project Servator, a policing operation designed to disrupt criminality of various kinds including terrorism, visited Trevone quarry in Penryn, Cornwall where Higgs lives and works, and a boatyard where he has a workshop. They were searching for Higgs, who was not at either location on the day they visited. Others who were there have complained that the tone of the police visits was intimidatory and amounted to harassment. Higgs was neither arrested nor charged with any criminal offence after the police visits. He lodged complaints with Devon and Cornwall police that the actions of the Project Servator officers were unlawful because they entered Trevone quarry without a warrant, an action he considers to be harassment and a breach of various parts of the Human Rights Act. His complaint was not upheld by Devon and Cornwall police’s professional standards department, so he approached the office of the police and crime commissioner for Devon and Cornwall and asked for a review of the internal police investigation. On 20 December he received the review, which was highly critical of the police and disagreed with the findings of the internal police complaint investigation that had vindicated the Project Servator officers. The review said the matter had not been dealt with in a “reasonable and proportionate” way in the internal police investigation and made a series of highly critical observations about Project Servator and the issues raised in Higgs’ complaint. Comments in the report include: Project Servator is “apparently increasingly being used as an intimidatory and oppressive national policing tactic”. While police witnesses were interviewed about the incident those visited by the police were not. “There appears to have been a quiescent acceptance of the police account of their actions by the [police] professional standards department.” Potential misconduct by police officers who visited the quarry and boatyard should also be considered. The matter should have been referred to the IOPC (Independent Office for Police Conduct) “given the politically sensitive and national implications of such disproportionality in a protest situation”. However, two days after Higgs received the report he was contacted by the office of the police and crime commissioner to say there had been an “error” in the review and it was being withdrawn. Officials said this was a “rare occurrence”. Higgs said: “Currently, in this country we still have the right to peaceful protest, which the policing bill would effectively remove. I’m worried about giving the police more power to curtail this. Too often they are already abusing the powers they have. I am suspicious about the police’s motivation in withdrawing this report.” He added that he and other climate activists are keen to work with police liaison officers about the nonviolent actions they are staging. A spokesperson for the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner for Devon, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly said: “A quality assurance process identified that a complaint review carried out by our office did not meet our usual high standards and contained comments about policing which do not represent the views of our office. We therefore took the decision to overrule the review outcome and repeat the process to ensure that all recommendations are correct appropriate standards met. The complaint review has been reassigned to an alternative investigator and we hope to have concluded it by the end of this week.” Shaun Sawyer, chief constable of Devon and Cornwall police said “Devon and Cornwall police note the complaint from Mr Higgs and the initial decision of the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner to uphold the complaint.“At the time, officers from Devon and Cornwall police were engaging with a number of individuals who had expressed a desire to peacefully protest at the event, the purpose of this being to facilitate that protest as effectively and safely as possible, while allowing the event of international significance to not be put under threat or unduly interrupted. “Project Servator is an overt and engaging national policing tactic to ensure communities are alive to the threat of terrorism and the importance of being prepared and able to report suspicious activity as well as not putting any group in undue danger by protesting in a way which may increase threat as a result.”",News/UK news,Report critical of police treatment of Cornish G7 activists withdrawn,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/06/police-cornish-g7-activists-report-withdrawn-project-servator
1/7/2022,"Boris Johnson has been criticised by his ethics adviser for acting “unwisely” but cleared of being deliberately misleading during an investigation into the funding of his Downing Street flat refurbishment. The prime minister apologised for failing to disclose crucial messages after facing questions from Lord Geidt over an undeclared WhatsApp exchange with a Tory peer who funded a makeover of the No 11 residence.  In an initial inquiry last Spring, Geidt reported Johnson insisted he knew nothing of the payments until “immediately prior” to newspaper reports in February 2021. Geidt cleared Johnson of wrongdoing, though said he had acted “unwisely”. However, a subsequent report compiled by the Electoral Commission unearthed that Johnson messaged the man behind the payments, David Brownlow, in November 2020 asking him to authorise further refurbishments to the flat. The discrepancy prompted a senior Labour MP to allege Johnson “may have lied”, and Geidt sought an explanation from the prime minister in several letters exchanged over the past month. The Conservatives were fined £17,800 in December for not reporting the £52,801 the party received via Lord Brownlow’s company (Huntswood Associates Ltd). Johnson blamed not sharing the WhatsApp message with Geidt on having changed phone numbers, saying he “did not have access to my previous device and did not recall the message exchange”. Geidt, who is the government’s independent adviser on ministerial interests, said he had concluded his initial finding Johnson did not break the ministerial code still stood: “The new disclosure did not in fact result in change to my original assessment of your interests insofar as they related to the ministerial code.” However, Geidt made clear his disdain at not having been given all the evidence originally and is expected to push to be given greater powers in subsequent investigations. He said the episode “shook my confidence precisely because potential and real failures of process occurred in more than one part of the apparatus of government”.",News/Politics,No 11 flat refurb: Lord Geidt criticises PM but says he did not deliberately mislead,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/06/no-10-refurb-lord-geidt-criticises-pm-but-says-he-did-not-deliberately-mislead
