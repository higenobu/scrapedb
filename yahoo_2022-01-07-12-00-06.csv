1/7/2022,"A woman was forced out of a grocery store in Montreal after going on a racist tirade in which she blamed Chinese people for the spread of COVID-19.

Ken Mak and his girlfriend were waiting at the checkout at IGA on Nuns’ Island when the unidentified woman allegedly approached them and asked if he was Chinese, reported CBC News. Mak, who moved to Canada 20 years ago, said he replied “yes,” which then prompted the woman to start asking about the coronavirus.

“Before I could respond, she would cut me off and start her monologue about how Chinese people are to blame for the whole coronavirus,” Mak told CBC News.

A store employee soon intervened and Mak pulled out his phone to film the scene.

“All of these 21 months of bullsh*t… All of these f*cking epidemic that became a pandemic, it’s because of you Chinese people!” the woman yells.

The irate customer went on to claim that her family has the best lawyer in Montreal.

The video ends with the woman being escorted out of the store after Montreal police reportedly arrived to help remove her from the premises.

In a statement, IGA said they are “incredibly disheartened and upset” over the woman’s disrespectful behavior.

“In such circumstances, we ask the customer to leave our store, as our team did in this instance. Local authorities were contacted to assist in this matter,” the company said, according to CTV News. “At IGA, we denounce all forms of hate. This is never acceptable.”

Mak, who posted the footage to Facebook, used the hashtag #StopAsianHate and urged others not to blame innocent people for the pandemic. He said the video “shall not be swept under the rug.”

“This pandemic has caused chaos in all our lives, and it is not acceptable to assault a specific minority for it. We all have been through the lockdowns, the curfews and the hardships in Quebec together just like everyone else,” Mak wrote. “All crisis ends, but until then we need to support each other, not blaming innocent people.”

The woman’s comments and behavior in the video have since been condemned by community leaders throughout Canada.

“I denounce this lady’s racist remarks, which are shocking and unacceptable,” Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante tweeted. “Anti-Asian racism has no place in Montreal, and this type of aggression should never be tolerated.”

Benoit Charette, Quebec’s minister tasked to oversee anti-racism efforts, also tweeted: “Saddening, shocking and condemnable! Behavior of this sort simply has no place in Quebec.”

“I denounce the woman verbal aggression towards #Asian Montrealers,” wrote Winston Chan, board member of National Coalition Against Anti-Asian Racism. “Asians should not be the blame of the pandemic.”

Montreal police documented 30 anti-Asian incidents between March and December 2020, eight of which were hate crimes, according to Global News.

1/7/2022,"Reps. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) took to the spotlight on Thursday to offer a reflection on last year's Capitol riot that varied pretty drastically from most others today. The two Republicans first appeared on Stephen Bannon's podcast to declare ""we're ashamed of nothing,"" as Gaetz put it, per Axios. ""We're proud of the work we did on Jan. 6 to make legitimate arguments about election integrity,"" Gaetz continued, with Greene's agreement. Later, they held a news conference (in lieu of a similar event by former President Donald Trump, who canceled his planned speech). Gaetz and Greene made the baseless claim that Capitol police, federal officials, and Democrats were in fact to blame for the violence that day. As The New York Times writes, ""there is no evidence that undercover agents or other outsiders played a role in the attack."" While Gaetz asserted ""we're here to get to the truth behind Jan. 6, the federal government's own involvement with it,"" he and Greene received swift pushback against their unproven claims. With their news conference as the only GOP event in the Capitol today (many other Republicans were at an event to honor the late Sen. Johnny Isakson), critics like author Jessica Shortall argued ""the party is 100% letting them be the face and stance of the party on this.""

1/7/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A senior Army three-star general with extensive experience in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars has been nominated to become the top U.S. commander for the Middle East. President Joe Biden has nominated Army Lt. Gen. Erik Kurilla to head U.S. Central Command and be promoted to four-star general, according to multiple U.S. officials. The Senate Armed Services Committee notice says only that Kurilla has been nominated to become a general, and does not detail which job he would get if confirmed. But his nomination for U.S. Central Command has been expected for several months. U.S. officials confirmed the planned job on condition of anonymity because it has not yet been made public. If confirmed by the Senate, Kurilla would replace Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, who has led the command for the past three years and is expected to retire. Kurilla would take over as the Pentagon continues to try and shift its focus to the Indo-Pacific and counter a rising China, and to bolster defenses against Russia in Europe, where Moscow is massing troops near the Ukraine border, fueling fears of an invasion. The U.S. has withdrawn all forces from Afghanistan and has now formally shifted its role in Iraq from combat to advising and assisting the Iraqi forces. But the U.S. strategy to put more emphasis on China and Russia has been repeatedly stymied by Iran, forcing the Pentagon to maintain a significant troop presence across the Middle East and cultivate strong relations with allies in the region. In recent weeks, Iranian-backed militia groups have increased the pace of their attacks on U.S. and allied forces in Iraq and Syria. The groups have made it clear they want all U.S. troops out of Iraq, and have vowed to continue attacks until they are gone. Since Monday there have been at least three attacks on bases that house U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria. The attacks included strikes by rockets and armed drones. Two armed drones were shot down Monday as they headed for a facility housing U.S. advisers at the Baghdad airport, and two explosives-laden drones were destroyed as they targeted an Iraqi military base housing American troops in western Anbar province on Tuesday. Kurilla, who is from Elk River, Minnesota, is currently commander of the 18th Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, but previously served as the chief of staff at Central Command, working for McKenzie and, before that, Gen. Joseph Votel. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1988, and has served multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, commanding conventional and special operations forces. He commanded a Stryker battalion in Iraq in 2004, and was shot and wounded. He later was commander of the 75th Ranger Regiment, overseeing combat teams deploying to Iraq and Afghanistan. He also served as director of operations at the Joint Special Operations Command and was commander of the 82nd Airborne Division.",World/Associated Press,Biden taps combat-hardened officer to lead Central Command,https://news.yahoo.com/biden-taps-combat-hardened-officer-220708428.html
1/7/2022,"With everybody you’ve ever followed on social media doing Dry January or some kind of cleanse, how is it that about 25 percent of adults in the U. S. have a dangerous liver condition right now? Sure, your liver appreciates the break. But alcohol is not the only thing hurting it, says Michael D. Leise, M.D., a Mayo Clinic transplant hepatologist. “I don’t drink much” needs to be retired from the “my liver’s fine” canon, because if you carry extra weight, get minimal exercise, or have bouts of overeating, your liver’s probably not fine. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition that’s exactly what it sounds like: Unhealthy amounts of fat build up in your liver. Over time, this can cause that organ to swell, scar, and eventually fail or develop cancer. In 2016, NAFLD cases in the U.S. were predicted to rise 18 percent by 2030 to more than 100 million. Risks are higher if you’re overweight or have obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol. But NAFLD can hit people without these issues. That’s because regardless of risk, your diet can help prevent or cause NAFLD. See, your liver gets first dibs on the blood coming from your digestive system, so whatever was in what you ate filters through it before going anywhere else. Overeating backs up the liver’s processing capabilities— especially if you eat a lot of foods high in carbs and fat. Scared? Good. That’s incentive to reverse fat buildup in your liver. You can do that fairly quickly—within a matter of weeks, says Elizabeth J. Parks, Ph.D., who studies NAFLD at the University of Missouri. What to do: As in foods that are high in fat and processed carbs, like doughnuts or barbecue-chicken pizza, says Parks. After you eat fat and carbs, your liver converts the sugar in the carbs to fat, and both are stored as energy. The trouble is, many people never get it out of storage. Fat buildup in your liver can happen fast. Parks coauthored a study that mimicked a tailgate: 18 guys downed about 5,000 calories’ worth of high-fat, high-sugar food and drinks (keeping blood alcohol at 0.10) in an afternoon. Within hours, nine had new fat deposits in their liver. Don’t go light on all fats, though—unsaturated fats, especially omega-3’s (the kind in fish and walnuts) may help keep NAFLD at bay. The usual good-for-you diet is well proven to help reduce liver fat. Good thing, because there aren’t any medications that can do it. To satisfy a sweet tooth, turn to fruit; research suggests that foods rich in polyphenols may help prevent fat storage in the liver. Other foods high in polyphenols to get more of: green tea, coffee, and nuts (especially walnuts), says Dr. Leise. Even if you’re eating healthy food, your daily calorie intake matters. Weight gain is one of the biggest risk factors for NAFLD. One easy-ish weight-management strategy: Set a carb curfew. While your morning bagel has a good chance of being burned off during the day, a sugary cereal bedtime snack is more likely to become liver fat overnight, says Parks. Being sedentary may cause NAFLD—even if you’re not overweight. Movement of any type, even three or four 20- to 40-minute moderate- intensity workouts a week, can help eliminate existing liver fat and prevent new fat from being produced and stored. Both resistance and cardio training help. Ask for a liver-function test next time you get a routine blood panel. Doctors may not automatically order this for you unless you are at risk for NAFLD, but it doesn’t hurt to have the numbers.
