1/4/2022,"Elizabeth Homes, the former CEO and founder of Theranos, has been found guilty on charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Holmes faces up to 20 years in prison for defrauding investors in her blood testing startup. The verdict comes after a months-long trial, and more than three years after she was first charged and forced to step down as CEO in 2018. Of the 11 total charges, Holmes was found guilty on four: conspiracy to defraud investors and three counts of wire fraud against individual investors. She was found not guilty on four additional charges, including one count of conspiracy to defraud patients, two counts of fraud against investors, and one count of wire fraud stemming from ads Theranos ran in Arizona. The jury was deadlocked on three other counts of wire fraud and returned no verdict on those charges. During the trial, Holmes’ lawyers tried to portray her as a young and inexperienced entrepreneur. “Elizabeth Holmes worked herself to the bone for 15 years trying to make lab testing more affordable,” one of Holmes’ attorneys said in opening arguments. “She failed … but failure is not a crime.” Holmes, who testified during the trial, said she hadn’t intended to mislead the public or investors, and had been advised to protect the company’s “trade secrets.” As The New York Times pointed out, she “spent much of her testimony arguing that others at Theranos were responsible for the company’s shortcomings.” The prosecution alleged that Holmes knew about serious flaws in the company’s technology and hid the issues from investors. Former patients who had received inaccurate blood tests also testified, including an Arizona woman who received an incorrect result for an HIV test, and a woman who was misdiagnosed with a miscarriage. Holmes’ story has been a source of widespread fascination even for those outside of Silicon Valley. At its peak, Theranos was valued at more than $9 billion, and had a board of directors filled with former high-ranking government officials, including two former Secretaries of State, Henry Kissinger and George Shultz. Holmes, who had dropped out of Stanford to start the company, regularly appeared on magazine covers and was often compared to Steve Jobs and other iconic founders. (Holmes herself was reportedly infatuated with Jobs and adopted his signature black turtlenecks.) Former Wall Street Journal reporter John Carreyrou was the first to report on issues with Theranos’ technology in 2015, and his coverage prompted multiple investigations and lawsuits that ultimately resulted in criminal charges for Holmes and former COO Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani. On the stand, Holmes testified that her romantic relationship with Balwani had been abusive. Balwani’s trial is scheduled to begin in February. There has been no shortage of pop culture depictions of Holmes. After Carreyrou’s best seller, Bad Blood, there was an HBO documentary and several podcasts about Theranos’ rise and ultimate downfall. Hulu is set to debut a new miniseries about the saga, with Amanda Seyfried starring as Holmes, in March. And Apple recently nabbed the Jennifer Lawrence-led film adaptation of Bad Blood. Holmes, who will likely appeal the charges, could face up to 20 years in prison, though it's not yet clear when she will be sentenced.  Developing…",Business/Engadget,Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes is found guilty of defrauding investors,https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-verdict-guilty-fraud-001725594.html
1/4/2022,"During an interview with Politifact in May 2021, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Dr. Anthony Fauci accidentally started to say that the United States collaborated with Chinese communists on gain-of-function research on coronaviruses before the pandemic erupted. Referring to Republican Senator Rand Paul’s intense interrogation of him and his organization during congressional hearings over the last year, Fauci attempted to elucidate the extent of U.S. scientific cooperation with China prior to the first Covid-19 outbreak. Doubling-down on his claim that the U.S. did not directly fund high-risk lab experimentation that allegedly generated Sars-CoV-2, Fauci appeared to nearly admit that the U.S. had at least worked with the Chinese Communist Party on gain-of-function research. “So in a very minor collaboration as part of a sub-contract of a grant, we had a collaboration with some Chinese commu… uh, Chinese scientists. And what he conflated with that is that we were involved in creating the virus, which is the most ridiculous majestic leap I’ve ever heard of,” he said. “That’s actually preposterous. It was just unfortunate that he said that. It was said in an accusatory way that just made no sense and was not based on any fact at all,” Fauci added. Earlier that morning in May, before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Paul had accused Fauci of “”juicing up” Covid-19 by allowing U.S. money to finance the Wuhan Virology Institute’s “gain of function research” through the NIH and then covering it up. “Three million people have died from this pandemic, and that should cause us to explore all possibilities. Instead, government authorities, self-interested in continuing gain-of-function research, say there’s nothing to see here,” Paul said. “For years, Dr. Ralph Baric, a virologist in the US, has been collaborating with Dr. Shi Zhengli of the Wuhan Virology Institute, sharing his discoveries about how to create super-viruses. This gain-of-function research has been funded by the NIH,” he added. Fauci retorted: “Senator Paul, with all due respect, you are entirely and completely incorrect. The NIH has not ever and does not now fund gain-of-function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.” Contradicting Fauci assurances, a top NIH official revealed in October that the U.S. did fund gain-of-function research on bat coronaviruses in Wuhan and that EcoHealth Alliance, the U.S. non-profit that funneled NIH money to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, was not transparent about the work it was doing. Lawrence A. Tabak of the NIH told Republican Representative James Comer in a letter about a “limited experiment” the lab conducted to test if “spike proteins from naturally occurring bat coronaviruses circulating in China were capable of binding to the human ACE2 receptor in a mouse model.” The laboratory mice that contracted the modified bat virus “became sicker” than those infected with the unmodified bat virus.

1/4/2022,"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he's meeting with MBS, The Wall Street Journal reported. Journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered in a Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018. MBS reportedly wants Erdogan to stop mentioning Khashoggi's murder. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman wants Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to promise that he won't mention journalist Jamal Khashoggi's murder again, The Wall Street Journal reported. Erdogan said he plans to visit Saudi Arabia next month after bin Salman reportedly invited him. The move is an effort to overcome tensions between the two nations that were further strained after Khashoggi was killed in a Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018. Khashoggi entered the consulate on October 2, 2018, to pick up marital documents needed to marry his Turkish fiancée, Hatice Cengiz, but never came out. Turkish officials have alleged that Khashoggi was killed inside the consulate and that his body was dismembered with a bone saw. Officials from the US and the United Nations have also corroborated these allegations. His remains have yet to be found. A declassified CIA intelligence report directly implicated the Saudi crown prince in Khashoggi's murder. A Turkish court is trying 26 Saudi nationals connected with the murder in absentia, with the next trial date set for July 8, Insider's Azmi Haroun previously reported. Saudia Arabia, on the other hand, put 11 people on trial for what they said was a ""rogue operation"" in Khashoggi's killing. In December 2019, the Riyadh Criminal Court sentenced five of them to death. Three others were given prison sentences. However, multiple members of the hit squad that killed Khashoggi are believed to be living in luxury villas in a government-run Saudi security compound, The Guardian reported last week. The Journal reported that Saudi Arabia has not confirmed the meeting between the Saudi crown prince and Erdogan but people familiar with the efforts have told the outlet that the two leaders have been trying to meet for weeks. While bin Salman's goal may be to ease the diplomatic issues and narrative following Khashoggi's killing, Erdogan may be moving forward with the meeting for economic support to help with Turkey's currency crisis, the Journal reported.

1/4/2022,"An airplane carrying smuggled migrants crashed in the West Texas desert and the pilot — a Texas man — ran from the site, abandoning severely injured passengers, according to the Presidio County Sheriff’s Office. And he’s still at large. Carrying six passengers, the four-seat aircraft was under-fueled and overloaded, investigators said. Extra weight, plus low fuel, helped bring the plane down north of the Presidio Lely International Airport around 3:50 p.m. on Dec. 30. Presidio sits on the Texas-Mexico border near Big Bend National Park, about 60 miles south of Marfa. Police say Tobias Penner Peters was attempting to transport the individuals from Presidio to another location in the U.S., but he lost control of the plane. Many were injured on impact but Peters managed to flee the scene of the “smuggling attempt gone wrong.” Presidio first responders, U.S. Border Patrol agents, and the state Department of Transportation all descended on the scene, assisting PCSO deputies’ search and rescue efforts, the sheriff’s office said. While Peters escaped, he probably didn’t walk away unscathed, according to the sheriff’s office. He likely suffered serious head trauma and may have also lost one of his eyes. Peters is described as 6 feet, 2 inches tall and weighing about 185 pounds, with blue eyes and red hair, police said. He has properties in Seminole, Texas but sometimes travels to Ojinaga, Mexico, across the border from Presidio. The sheriff’s office has warrants out for his arrest on charges of felony human smuggling, evading arrest, and deadly conduct. Anyone with information on Peters whereabouts is encouraged to call the Presidio County Sheriff’s Office at 432-729-4848.
