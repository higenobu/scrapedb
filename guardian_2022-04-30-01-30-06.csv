4/30/2022,"Klaus Schulze, who has died aged 74 after suffering from renal disease, released more than 60 albums in his lifetime. He was often the recipient of such accolades as the godfather of techno music, was considered part of the Berlin School of electronic music and was credited with being an inspirational figure in ambient and IDM (intelligent dance music). Perhaps it would be more accurate to describe him as a versatile and gifted composer whose music encompassed ideas from many genres, including classical and jazz, which he expressed through mainly electronic means. Though he started out as a rock drummer who was briefly a member of Tangerine Dream, he always knew that he “wanted to play with harmonies and sounds”. The revolutionary arrival of synthesisers in the early 1970s gave him the tools that could express his bubbling musical ideas. The film music composer Hans Zimmer used one of Schulze’s pieces as part of his score for the movie Dune (2021), and described his work as “the perfect balance between the soul and technology”. Born in Berlin, Schulze gained musical experience in his teens playing drums and sometimes guitar and bass in a variety of local bands. He recalled that he began playing drums because of the influence of his older brother, who introduced him to jazz sticksmen such as Art Blakey and Buddy Rich. In 1967 he joined the rock trio Psy Free, alongside the guitarist Alex Conti and organ player Joachim Schumann, then in 1969 Schulze joined Tangerine Dream. The group was in a fluid, formative phase and Schulze was replaced by Christopher Franke in 1970, having had his ideas for adding experimental sounds rejected by the bandleader Edgar Froese. However, he did play on their debut album Electronic Meditation, a free-ranging mix of jazz, rock and electronica. He found the role of the drummer too restrictive. “As a drummer you are the backbone of a rock group, but not the soloist who performs his own musical ideas,” he said in a 2015 interview. Shulze then joined with Manuel Göttsching and Hartmut Enke to form Ash Ra Tempel, with whom he made the album Ash Ra Tempel before leaving to pursue a solo career. In 1972 he released his first solo album, Irrlicht, now considered a noteworthy moment in the history of ambient music. Schulze recorded it using a broken organ and the sound of a symphony orchestra played backwards, but for his next album, Cyborg (1973), he took a leap into the future by deploying an EMS VCS3 synthesiser, a pioneering instrument also used by such luminaries as Pink Floyd, Jean-Michel Jarre and the Who. After taking time out to record an album with the so-called Krautrock supergroup Cosmic Jokers (1974), Schulze displayed increasing artistic confidence and a growing command of his new medium, as reflected in such milestones of electronic music as Timewind (1975) and Moondawn (1976). These exhibited a mastery of delicate textures that would evolve and blend over the course of extended compositions filling a whole side of an LP. Track titles such as Floating and Mindphaser indicated the effect Schulze wanted his music to have on his listeners. In 1975 his horizons had expanded further when he went to Tokyo to produce progressive rockers Far East Family Band. Their keyboard player Kitarō later became a superstar of New Age music, and always gave Schulze credit for inspiring him to embrace the world of synths and electronica. In 1976, Schulze’s burgeoning status found him performing on Stomu Yamashta’s Go album alongside Steve Winwood, Paul Buckmaster, guitarist Al Di Meola and percussionist Michael Shrieve. The musicians performed the material live, prompting the album Go Live from Paris, with a further album Go Too appearing in 1977. Schulze’s evocative, artfully layered music lent itself to soundtrack work. Body Love (his seventh solo album, 1977) was the soundtrack to Lasse Braun’s titular pornographic movie, and a Volume 2 followed. He would also create soundtracks for movies such as Barracuda and Next of Kin, but a more significant achievement was his album Dune (1979), inspired by Frank Herbert’s classic sci-fi novel. Here, Schulze adopted an almost neoclassical approach, mixing cello and Arthur Brown’s vocals into his often eerie electronic soundscapes. When Zimmer composed the soundtrack for Denis Villeneuve’s 2021 film of Dune, he based one of the pieces from his Dune Sketchbook album on Schulze’s composition Frank Herbert, from Schulze’s album X (1978). “Klaus Schulze’s music has never been as relevant as it is now,” Zimmer commented. “The world has finally caught up to a true pioneer.” During the 1980s Schulze began taking advantage of new digital technology alongside older analog equipment such as the Moog synthesiser, a shift detectable in albums such as Dig It (1980) and Trancefer (1981). On his own Innovative Communication label he released work by artists including Popol Vuh and Software. In the 90s he temporarily became infatuated with the use of pre-recorded sampled sounds, as heard on the album Beyond Recall. As the new millennium dawned, Schulze leaned more towards classical music and jazz, mixing these with contemporary electronica techniques. Schulze engaged in a variety of collaborative ventures. Between 1994 and 2008 he teamed up with Pete Namlook to record 11 volumes of The Dark Side of the Moog, each one adapting a song title from Pink Floyd (for instance Wish You Were There or Obscured By Klaus). He also worked with Code III, Earthstar, Rainer Bloss and Lisa Gerrard from Dead Can Dance, with whom he also performed live, and in 2000 he reunited briefly with Ash Ra Tempel. In 1979 he released Time Actor, the first of a series of albums he recorded as Richard Wahnfried, the name apparently an oblique nod to the composer Richard Wagner. In 2005 he began reissuing his earlier works, including previously unreleased material. In 2013 he announced that he was giving up performing live concerts. A new album, Deus Arrakis, is due to be released in June. He is survived by his wife, two sons and four grandchildren.

4/30/2022,"The oil and gas industry has defended the amount it invests in the North Sea, ahead of a storm over bumper profits as households face rocketing energy bills. The energy companies BP and Shell are expected to report soaring profits next week as a result of sky-high energy prices, fuelling fresh calls for a windfall tax to help hard-pressed households struggling with record bills for heating and power. Executives at energy firms including BP were summoned to speak to the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, on Friday, to be told to invest more in UK projects, including the North Sea and offshore wind, in order to avoid being hit by a tax on their earnings. The meeting, first reported by the Times, comes amid a change of rhetoric among ministers about a windfall tax, despite weeks of rejections of such a move, after the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, hinted on Wednesday at a possible U-turn. Sunak told Mumsnet that this kind of policy was “never off the table”, and that ministers would consider it if investment by companies in Britain’s energy security failed to materialise. However, energy companies insist they have already outlined plans to invest more in the UK. A spokesperson for the oil trade body Offshore Energies UK (OEUK) pointed to its own data, which shows that members plan to invest £20bn on UK projects to extract oil and gas between now and 2026, in what they said was a higher annual rate than in previous years. Separately, OEUK estimates that £60bn will be invested in UK offshore wind projects by the end of the decade. Shell said earlier this month it planned to invest up to £25bn in the UK energy system over the next decade, three-quarters of which would be spent on offshore wind, hydrogen and electric vehicle infrastructure, rather than the North Sea. In February, BP outlined plans to spend twice as much on UK projects as it earns from its operations in the country, although it has not yet put a figure on the value of this investment. Offshore wind, solar and hydrogen are among the planned projects. A windfall tax would not only affect the big energy firms such as BP and Shell, but also lesser-known companies such as Harbour Energy, which produces the most oil from the North Sea, totalling 163,000 barrels a day in 2021. Families and businesses are already feeling the pinch from higher energy bills, which are set to rocket further in the autumn. A surge in wholesale gas prices at the start of last winter also sparked the collapse of 30 energy suppliers, affecting almost 4.5 million customers. The high-profile failure of the energy provider Bulb last November will push up the UK’s public sector net borrowing by £1.2bn in the financial year ending in 2022, according to a new official estimate. Bulb, which supplied 1.7m homes, was effectively nationalised when it handed its responsibilities over to a special administrator. The resulting impact on the UK’s public finances has been calculated by the Office for Budget Responsibility. The Office for National Statistics said the full effect of the collapse on national finances would not be clear until Bulb comes out of special administration.",News/Business,Oil and gas industry defends North Sea spending levels as Kwarteng urges more,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/29/oil-gas-firms-north-sea-investment-kwasi-kwarteng-windfall-tax
4/30/2022,"Samantha Bee tore into the trove of damning text messages handed over to the House January 6 committee by former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows – more than 2,319 text messages with numerous Trump allies and GOP lawmakers. “More than 2,000 text messages! This proves definitively that Mark Meadows is a gossipy little bitch,” the Full Frontal host said Thursday evening. “Some of the most damning texts came on election day, like when Fox News host Sean Hannity promised Meadows he would push his listeners to get Trump elected,” she continued. When Meadows pressed Hannity to “stress every vote matters”, the host replied: “Yes sir. On it.” “You know, it’s actually kind of nice to know that inside Sean Hannity’s soft, weak exterior rests an even softer, weaker man,” said Bee. “In the days after the election, Mark Meadows’ phone kept blowing up in a group text that included villains such as Ivanka Trump, Hope Hicks, Jared Kushner and Jason Miller,” she added. “In other words, they were basically only missing Jafar and Ursula the Sea Witch.” Though messages show some Trump aides, including Kushner, sent evidence countering Trump’s baseless election fraud claims, the White House continued peddling the big lie. “Despite mounting worries, a total lack of fraud evidence and a warning about potential violence on January 6, Meadows and company went full speed ahead anyways,” Be explained. “Of course, when it did turn violent, it wasn’t enough for true believers like Marjorie Taylor Greene,” who texted Meadows days later to suggest they stop Biden from taking office by having Trump declare “Marshall Law”. “And if you’re thinking, ‘that’s not how you spell martial law,’ you are very correct,” Bee said, adding “Marshall’s Law, as everyone knows, is that no one should pay retail prices for quality yoga pants. “It’s also hard to paint the whole picture when we don’t have the whole picture,” she continued. “There are more than 1,000 texts Meadows refuses to turn over. Damn! Mark Meadows, you are messy. Delete my number!” “If there’s one things these texts prove, it’s that it doesn’t matter to Republicans if they know for a fact that Joe Biden won the election,” she concluded. “What matters is these human bumper stickers are more than willing to use lies and a violent base to both take and keep power.” On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah dug into a bizarre court transcript from a New York civil suit against Donald Trump for inciting violence against protesters outside Trump Tower in 2015. “OK, first of all, it’s crazy that there are so many Trump scandals that he’s literally getting dragged into court for something we didn’t know was a thing,” Noah said. “Nobody knew about this! I didn’t. Trump lawsuits are like Nicolas Cage movies – there’s a bunch where you’re like, ‘He lost a pig? When did that happen?’” During the October 2021 deposition, Trump “came up with one of the most crazy defenses I’ve ever heard”, Noah said: that he was worried protesters would throw “dangerous fruit” at him. Noah and Michael Kosta performed the transcript, because “no comedy writer is going to come up with something funnier than Trump’s deposition”, Noah said. No comedy writer is going to come up with something funnier than Trump’s deposition on “dangerous fruit.” pic.twitter.com/fsLdopyuw4 Such verbatim lines include: “It’s worse than tomato, it’s other things also. But tomato, when they start doing that stuff, it’s very dangerous. There was an alert out that day” and “To stop somebody from throwing pineapples, tomatoes, bananas, stuff like that, yeah … it’s dangerous stuff.” “I will say this: he’s not wrong about being hit with a pineapple being dangerous – I mean, that’s got spikes built in,” Noah commented at the end. “You know what I think the worst fruit is to get with? A honeydew. Not because it’s hard but because you could get some of it in your mouth and that shit is disgusting.” And on Late Night, Seth Meyers mocked the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, who was caught lying about wanting Trump to resign after the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Audio has revealed McCarthy told a House members only call in the immediate aftermath of the attack that he would urge Trump to resign. Asked to comment on the evidence of his false denial this week, McCarthy flailed and said, nodding to his members: “Ask them, ask if I told any of them.” “Your claim is that you weren’t lying when you denied that you said you had urged Trump to resign, because the reporter asked you if you had urged Trump to resign, which you claimed you didn’t,” Meyers explained. “And if we want to know if you told your members you would urge Trump to resign, we should ask your members if you told them you would urge him to resign, instead of just listening to the audio where you told them that you would urge Trump to resign.” If that made no sense to you, that’s fine – it didn’t to Meyers either. “I feel like I just spent an hour trying to find an exit in a MC Escher painting.” “Why would we ask your members if you said it?” Meyers wondered. “We have the audio of you telling your members that impeachment would pass and Trump should resign.”",Arts/Culture,"Samantha Bee on the Capitol attack inquiry: ‘Mark Meadows, you are messy’",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/29/samantha-bee-full-frontal-recap-mark-meadows-capitol-attack

4/30/2022,"Acute HRT shortages have left some women taking extreme measures to access medication, with some reportedly travelling hundreds of miles, borrowing from friends or even turning to the hidden market. So what advice do experts have for those trying to manage menopause symptoms without their usual medicine? Haitham Hamoda, clinical lead for the menopause service at King’s College hospital and chair of the British Menopause Society, said that, while the onus should not be on patients to deal with the crisis, there were some practical steps that could be taken. “There’s been a lot of reports of people going online and to the black market which gives a bit of a sensational aspect to this,” he said. Instead, Hamoda recommends that, if necessary, women can switch to different HRT preparations designed to deliver the same hormone concentrations. The British Menopause Society has published an equivalence guide for GPs and specialist doctors that indicates the closest alternatives for drugs that are in short supply, such as Oestrogel, an oestrogen-only form of HRT made by Besins Healthcare UK, and FemSeven Sequi patches. “There might be some variation in absorption, you might get a little bit more or less, but it’s not going to be a huge difference,” he said. “In the interim that’s what I’d encourage people to do.” To avoid a back-and-forth between GP surgery and pharmacy, a patient can ask their GP to check availability with pharmacies in advance. Similarly, most community pharmacies will be able to contact GPs to ask whether they can dispense an alternative drug, rather than sending the patient back for another consultation. Claire Anderson, president of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, is calling for the law to be changed so that pharmacists can make such minor changes without further consultation with doctors. Anderson urged women not to swap medication with friends, as the MP Caroline Nokes described doing this week. “People shouldn’t be using other people’s medicines. Your medicine is individually prescribed for you and you should never ever share medicines. I would really strongly discourage that.” HRT boosts levels of hormones that decrease as women approach the menopause, in particular oestrogen. This helps reduce a wide range of symptoms linked to changing hormone levels, including hot flushes, night sweats, vaginal dryness and mood swings. Some also take HRT to protect bone health. However, Anderson points out, different products have different benefit-risk profiles. Combined HRT (containing oestrogen and progestogen) is linked to a slight increase in breast cancer risk, while HRT tablets – but not gels or patches – are linked to a slight increase in blood clots. Prof Waljit Dhillo, an endocrinologist at Imperial College London, said he would advise patients to try to stay on the same treatment if possible as it can take six weeks for symptoms to stabilise after beginning a new form of HRT. “The problem is people are stabilised on one preparation, switching to another preparation … it’s not just like switching bread,” he said. However, he said, if shortages are expected to last beyond six weeks, it is probably worth patients switching to another drug. Dhillo said that, while some people find alternative remedies helpful, the clinical evidence that such treatments are effective is “not very good” and so they should not be treated as a replacement for HRT. Previous research has also shown that lifestyle changes such as cutting down on caffeine and alcohol and exercising regularly can help manage menopause symptoms. “Exercise is a good thing to do but it’s not going to be as effective,” said Dhillo.",News/Society,What can I do if I can’t get HRT?,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/29/what-can-i-do-if-i-cant-get-hrt
4/30/2022,"Five years ago, Lorraine Kelly wanted to interview a famous woman about their experience of the menopause on her daytime TV show. Everyone she approached refused, so she decided to turn the tables and have a doctor interview her about her personal story.Kelly shared with viewers about how she had felt “flat and joyless” despite leading a life she was happy with. It had taken a revelatory consultation with her interviewer, the TV medic Hilary Jones, to learn that she was not suffering from depression, but had menopausal symptoms. “I thought, nobody else will talk about it so I’ll do it. It was a breakthrough moment, and that’s what I think daytime telly does very well – we’re not afraid to tackle anything. I had someone talking about how to do a poo test for bowel cancer on the show this morning,” she said. Since Kelly’s interview, attitudes towards the menopause have shifted dramatically. Celebrities including Gwyneth Paltrow, Oprah Winfrey and Gillian Anderson have spoken out, while a gamechanging documentary produced by Davina McCall in 2020 resulted in what some doctors have called a “Davina effect” among patients whose midlife struggles suddenly made sense. In particular, women have extolled the virtues of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for managing symptoms ranging from hot flushes and night sweats to anxiety and depression.This has led to huge growth in awareness of how debilitating menopausal symptoms can be, resulting in unprecedented demand for treatment that culminated in HRT shortages this week.Kelly said she had been proud to break a longstanding taboo. “We knew from the response from viewers that there was a problem here, and I was able to use my own particular problems to help other people – that’s a huge privilege, and a responsibility.”She has discussed the HRT shortage on the show this week. “This is a scandal. Obviously, it affects me personally because I’ll run out of patches soon … You can be damn sure if this was a problem affecting men it wouldn’t be happening.”Doctors have been glad to see awareness of menopausal symptoms raised by celebrities and on social media, but some worry that the emphasis on personal experience is resulting in a perception that HRT is the best remedy.Paula Briggs, the chair of the British Menopause Society, said the scale of the celebrity involvement in the menopause was “the most bizarre thing I’ve ever seen” in medicine. While she said much was helpful, there was also “evangelistic” misinformation shared on social media based on “a selective interpretation of clinical research papers”. This includes recommending higher doses of HRT, saying it’s safe for women with a history of breast cancer in their family, or claiming it protects against dementia. “Unless you’ve done medical training and you understand, it’s very easy to take a superficial approach.” Some women feel pressured into taking HRT when it’s not right for them, with lifestyle changes such as a healthier diet or more exercise sometimes a better starting point, or paying for private clinics, she added.Olivia Hum, a menopause specialist, said in the medical community there was “a real worry that the debate has swung too far in the opposite direction”, with people feeling “very scared about menopause and the symptoms”.However, she added that McCall’s documentary “has done the most immense amount of good for women”. “I’m not particularly pro-celebrity endorsement of medical stuff, but the information she gave was very scientific … my inbox filled up during the documentary with emails from women who went, ‘Oh my god, I never realised this was the menopause. I lost my job, my relationship … I just realised I don’t have to put up with this crap any more’,” she said.The journalist Mariella Frostrup, who wrote Cracking the Menopause, said women had been forced to share personal experiences publicly because, like many women’s health issues, menopause “hasn’t been taken nearly seriously enough”. “The idea that this is something celebrities are demanding, but that it’s an unnecessary thing, adds to the ridiculousness of the situation and the injustice. I think women have been incredibly poorly served by a system that’s patronised them and ignored the very real suffering,” she said. Heather Currie, former BMS chair and an NHS gynaecologist, said the high-profile public discourse had helped extinguish misconceptions around HRT that arose from publicity exaggerating its risks in the late 1990s. But she added that some dangerous messages had gained traction, for example recommending HRT for the rest of your life, while certain symptoms that are more embarrassing to talk about, such as bladder problems, are sidelined. Individual experiences are also sometimes unhelpfully extrapolated into universal advice. “Women are affected completely differently. There is a huge range in symptoms, their severity and the impact they can have,” she said.Currie said the goal should be for women to feel they can trust their doctors, which hasn’t always been the case due to a previous lack of training. “The key thing is accurate information for women that they can easily access, and consistent advice when they go to a healthcare professional.”",News/Society,‘Breakthrough moment’: how celebrities helped shift the menopause debate,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/29/breakthrough-moment-how-celebrities-helped-shift-the-menopause-debate
4/30/2022,"Ukrainian officials have accused Russian forces of seizing “over 2,000 artworks” from museums in the occupied city of Mariupol and moving the pieces to areas of the Russian-controlled Donbas region. “The occupiers ‘liberated’ Mariupol from its historical and cultural heritage. They stole and moved more than 2,000 unique exhibits from museums in Mariupol to Donetsk,” the Mariupol city council said in a statement posted on its Telegram channel on Thursday. They said the haul includes several original works by the 19th-century Mariupol native Arkhip Kuindzhi and the famed Russian romantic painter Ivan Aivazovsky as well as a unique handwritten Torah scroll, and the Gospel of 1811 made by the Venetian printing house for the Greeks of Mariupol. “Mariupol city council is preparing materials for law enforcement agencies to initiate criminal proceedings and make an appeal to Interpol,” the council added. In a separate statement, Petro Andriushchenko, a member of the city council, said Russia seized three original paintings by Kuindzhi, who gained international fame for his portraits of the Russian landscape. According to the Mariupol city council, the works came from the three local museums, including the Kuindzhi art museum, which was heavily damaged during a Russian airstrike on 21 March 2022. Natalia Kapustnikova, director of the Mariupol Local History museum, told the pro-Kremlin outlet Izvestiya that she handed over the works of Aivazovsky and Kuindzhi to the Russian forces “following the end of the hostilities”. “The head of the Kuindzhi art museum hid the paintings when the war started. I knew where they were … They were then moved to safety,” she said. Moscow has largely taken control of the south-eastern port city of Mariupol, which has been razed to rubble by Russian bombs. An estimated 2,000 Ukrainian troops and up to 1,000 civilians are still holed up in the besieged Azovstal steel plant on the outskirts of the city. If confirmed, the art seizure in Mariupol would signify the first known instance of mass cultural looting by Russian forces since the start of the war. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, previously accused Russian troops of engaging in mass looting after video and audio recordings appeared to show Russian forces sending parcels containing stolen goods back to Russia. The Guardian also collected evidence that suggests looting by Russian forces was a systematic part of Russian military behaviour in Ukraine. Ukraine has rushed to preserve its art objects and monuments since the outbreak of the war more than two months ago, as many feared Moscow would specifically target the country’s cultural heritage, a war crime under international law. Ukrainian fears for its cultural assets have been exacerbated by a series of public speeches made by Russian President Vladimir Putin in which he rejected Ukraine’s independent identity, language and traditions. A number of leading museums across the country have since moved their art to undisclosed locations. The global arts organisation Getty previously warned that millions of artworks and monuments in Ukraine were at risk of being looted or bombed. In a March statement, Getty said: “The material cultural heritage of the world is our common heritage, the identity and inspiration for all humanity. Cultural heritage has the power to unite us and is critical for achieving peace.” “It is also too often the target of war, another way to destroy and overtake a society by erasing its memory.” A number of Ukrainian cultural sights have already been destroyed by Russian shelling, including the Ivankiv museum, which housed Ukrainian folk art, while Unesco estimates that over 50 Ukrainian historical buildings have suffered extensive damage since the start of Russia’s invasion. The Guardian has contacted the Russian military for comment.",News/World news,"Ukraine accuses Russian forces of seizing 2,000 artworks in Mariupol",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/29/ukraine-accuses-russian-forces-of-seizing-2000-artworks-in-mariupol
4/30/2022,"It is somewhat rich of Jacob Rees-Mogg to criticise civil servants for not attending the office (Civil service head warns PM against forcing Whitehall workers back to office, 25 April) when it was the Tory government who, when I was a civil servant, cut back on office space and enforced “desk sharing” so that one had to store one’s papers etc in a mobile cabin (which we used to call wheelie bins) and search, often wasting time, for a free desk in the office. It was also the case that when offices were full, many staff were less productive due to having to attend pointless meetings. Less assiduous staff could get away with appearing busy by walking around looking important with a sheaf of files, but never actually doing anything with them, or indulging in chitchat and extended tea breaks, which I suppose could be masked as Rees-Mogg’s “collaborative working”.Ian ArnottPeterborough  Jacob Rees-Mogg appears to have two issues regarding civil servants and hybrid working. The first is that civil servants cannot possibly be (trusted to be) productive if they are not at their desks, and the second is that empty desks in the centre of London, where property costs are high, equate to unacceptably high costs for the taxpayer. Does this mean that he will now be leaving similar notes on the near empty benches in the House of Commons, and does it also mean that he will now be campaigning for a new parliament building that will obviate the exorbitantly high costs of repairing and maintaining the Palace of Westminster? I doubt it.Jane RoffeyArnside, Cumbria  Like Simon Jenkins, I’m bemused by Jacob Rees-Mogg’s demand that civil servants return to their office (Working 9-5 doesn’t mean being chained to a desk. Someone tell Jacob Rees-Mogg, 25 April). For the last three decades, the Conservatives have preached “labour market flexibility”, and insisted that workers must embrace occupational change by accepting new modes of working. Yet now it is Tories such as Rees-Mogg who seem to be insisting on labour market rigidity and outdated working practices – the very things that Conservatives have always accused the trade unions of.Pete DoreyBath  I hope that the head of the civil service, Simon Case, has explained to Jacob Rees-Mogg that attendance in the office is no guarantee of busyness. When a group of us were moved into the Treasury as part of a Whitehall reshuffle under Margaret Thatcher, we found it a very sleepy organisation. We listened credulously to a report that when a civil servant had died at his desk, the ambulance had come to take away the wrong person.Rob HullLondon  You report that the cabinet secretary and “at least” four government departments’ permanent secretaries have “warned” the prime minister not to force civil servants back into the office. It seems that these people are happy to see their staff continuing to draw their London weighting allowances while working from home, though the multiple crises in the Passport Office, DVLA and numerous other departments suggest that, if they are in fact “working from home”, they are not doing so with any semblance of efficiency. Could I suggest that the first five civil servants to be made an example of to improve services are these aforementioned secretaries, and that making them unemployed would set the appropriate example? After all, as they no longer have to run offices filled by staff, they are effectively all redundant.Ian McnicholasWaunlwyd, Blaenau Gwent  Please, for all our sakes, would Jacob Rees-Mogg just ignore his own advice and work more from home?Don BrownTregarth, Gwynedd  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

4/30/2022,"The Netherlands has been forced again to face questions about attitudes to sexual violence towards women after one of the country’s most famous football pundits appeared to admit live on air to assaulting an unconscious woman with a candle 50 years ago. Dutch prosecutors opened an investigation after Johan Derksen, 73, made the comments on Tuesday on the talkshow Today Inside, to the amusement of presenter Wilfred Genee and fellow pundit René van der Gijp. The former player, who is one of the Netherlands’ most famous TV personalities, sought to backtrack on his statement the following day, claiming the candle had only been placed close to the unnamed woman’s legs. But he has refused to apologise for the remarks, saying only that he had been unclear and had told the story of a drunken night five decades ago “in the wrong tone”. In response to the outcry, Derksen added: “There is no room for a Johan Derksen in the Netherlands.” A spokesperson for the Dutch prosectors’ office said the chief prosecutor in the northern Netherlands service had opened an inquiry. “This research is aimed at establishing the truth of possible criminal behaviour that was discussed in that programme”, they said. “We also call on those involved to tell their story, as far as possible. It is clear that this is highly unacceptable behaviour that transgresses boundaries. “In addition, the way in which it is talked about in the TV programme is also particularly hurtful. This can deeply affect victims of sexual offences even after a long time.” The case comes fast on the back of claims of widespread sexual abuse on the Dutch version of The Voice, which has raised questions about attitudes to sexual exploitation and violence towards women in the country. Two out of three women in the Netherlands reported that they were harassed on Dutch streets in 2021, according to figures from the Central Bureau of Statistics. Both Today Inside and The Voice Holland are produced by the media company Talpa, run by John de Mol, a founder of the Big Brother franchise. Talpa had said the presenters would apologise on Thursday for their comments but it was revealed later that Derksen had quit. Derksen reportedly told reporters: “We were to offer our sincere apologies and then they would to decide to continue the programme. We’re not here to pass an apology exam. Kiss my arse.” During the programme, which was watched by 600,000 viewers, Derksen had recounted what he later described as a “childhood sin” in 1971, when he would have been 22. He said: “I was out with the keeper of Veendam, with two ladies. We’re drunk, we’re going to that house and those ladies are so drunk, they puke all over us. Then I remember – and I’m not proud of it, but things like that happen when you’re young – that lady was lying unconscious on one of those couches and there was this big candle and we put it in it and then we left.” In the UK, Rape Crisis offers support for rape and sexual abuse on 0808 802 9999 in England and Wales, 0808 801 0302 in Scotland, or 0800 0246 991 in Northern Ireland.

4/30/2022,"The presence or absence of any realisation of the definite article in Yorkshire dialects (Letters, 26 May) depends on which part of the county you’re talking about. An article in Leeds Studies in English in 1952 was the first to map the fact that in the local dialect of Hull and surrounding areas there is no definite article at all. A friend who grew up in Hull said that, when learning to read, she was intrigued by this little word “the” that didn’t exist in her speech. She mastered it and learned to use it correctly in writing, and her adult speech featured the standard versions, /ðə/ before a consonant phoneme and /ði/ before a vowel phoneme.Greg BrooksEmeritus professor of education, University of Sheffield  As a Lancastrian, may I say that Yorkie Jeremy Muldowney ’its nail right on th’ead (Letters, 25 April). The conventional use of t’ to represent a northern glottal-stopped definite article in front of a consonant bears no resemblance to the actual sound, irritates many northerners and can be a source of confusion to everyone else. A good example is in the 1961 film Whistle Down the Wind, set in the Ribble valley, when London-born and Guildhall-trained actor Elsie Wagstaff, knowing the t’ should not be pronounced as written, omits the glottal stop altogether and shouts to Bernard Lee: “Are yer goin’ to pub?” It’s a horrible false note in an otherwise perfect film.Michael PykeLichfield, Staffordshire  The Yorkshire t’ can indeed be a source of confusion.

4/30/2022,"Kathryn Hughes, reviewing Terry Eagleton’s book Critical Revolutionaries (21 April), says, “Cambridge, the university with which they were all connected, was not particularly welcoming to female academics”, the “they” being TS Eliot, William Empson, FR Leavis and Raymond Williams. Prof Hughes might take solace in the fact it was Empson’s Seven Types of Ambiguity that was the major springboard for the “new criticism” of the next six decades (and beyond), and that Empson got the whole idea from Laura Riding and her book, written with Robert Graves, A Survey of Modernist Poetry, published in 1927. Recent scholarly work shows that she was the authentic provider of thought in this book, including the close analysis of Shakespeare’s Sonnet 129, which sent Empson off in a scribbling frenzy to write his book based on that analysis. She has never been accorded recognition for this because of the mafia-like conspiracy post-1940 that arose under the auspices of Graves and his public school acolytes. Empson himself refused to recognise her as the foremost author of A Survey of Modernist Poetry because, he said at the time, “I didn’t know who she was”, and left her out of his acknowledgements. It is also no coincidence that Riding was a member of the renowned “Fugitive” group of poets in America, which included, significantly, John Crowe Ransom, a real critic, before she came to England in 1926 and set the poetry world abuzz. Much of A Survey of Modernist Poetry is taken from her book written at the same time, Contemporaries and Snobs, a work of intellectual rigour which has thus far proven to be beyond the ordinary intelligence of literary criticism.

4/30/2022,"The 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket on Saturday revolves around Charlie Appleby’s Native Trail, last year’s champion juvenile colt, who will be one of the shortest-priced favourites this century when 15 runners go to post for the first Classic of the 2021 season. Like the same stable’s Pinatubo, who was odds-on for the Guineas two years ago, Native Trail arrives at Newmarket unbeaten and with juvenile Group One victories in the National Stakes and Dewhurst Stakes already in the book. Unlike Pinatubo, who finished third, he has already notched a win as a three-year-old, outclassing five rivals when 1-4 favourite for the Craven Stakes earlier this month. The question for punters, though, must be whether Native Trail’s price of around 11-10 is a fair reflection of his chance. Appleby himself seems uncertain whether the favourite or Coroebus, his stable companion, will prove to be the better colt this season, while other live contenders include the unbeaten Luxembourg, last season’s Vertem Futurity winner, and Perfect Power, a dual Group One winner as a juvenile. Thursday’s draw for stall positions could also make life difficult for William Buick. Stall 15, on the wide outside, is tricky enough, but his main rivals are all drawn from one to four, close to with Royal Patronage, the most likely pace-setter, in six. It is possible that the race will develop on the opposite side of the track to the favourite, and Perfect Power (3.40), at around 14-1, is a big price to make the most of his draw in stall three. Those odds reflect the facts that Richard Fahey’s colt is unraced beyond seven furlongs, can be a handful in the preliminaries and is a son of a five-furlong specialist. There is middle-distance stamina on the other side of his pedigree, though, and more importantly, he shaped as though he is likely to stay a mile in the Greenham earlier this month. That trial was run in a strong time and Christophe Soumillon did only what was required to secure the win. Normal improvement will make Perfect Power a live contender, so at a double-figure price, he is an excellent each-way bet against the hot favourite.

Thirsk 2.05: Empirestateofmind improved from race to race last season and looked better than ever when winning in a useful time at Ripon earlier this month. Newmarket 2.25: The bare form of Fast Medicine’s six-length win at Nottingham earlier this month was backed up by the clock and a 5lb penalty is unlikely to make much difference here. Goodwood 2.40: Primo Bacio’s form tailed off at the end of last year but she was a regular in Group One company and a return to early-season form would make her hard to beat. Newmarket 3.00: Arecibo, proven over track and trip, would have gone close in this last year with a clear run and catches the eye at around 10-1.

4/30/2022,"‘Atimeless story of parental harm done to children”, is composer Michael Zev Gordon’s description of the myth of Daedalus and Icarus. His Icarus opera has been a long time in the making; in 2011 he wrote a brief theatre piece based on the legend, but Raising Icarus, staged by Barber Opera, is the real thing, an impressive full-length chamber opera, to a libretto by Stephen Plaice. It tells the story of the smith Daedalus and his ultimately tragic ambitions for his son in three succinct acts: from Icarus’s failure to be the kind of skilled craftsman his father wants; through Daedalus’s indebtedness to Minos, the ruthless, impotent king of Crete, whose wife, Pasiphaë, is infatuated with a bull by whom she has a child; Daedalus’s building of the labyrinth to contain that monstrous offspring, the minotaur; the father and son’s escape from it on the wings that Daedalus makes for them; and Icarus’s fatal, hubristic flight. Plaice’s unselfconsciously rhymed text presents the narrative very clearly, if occasionally just a bit too wordily, but Gordon’s setting of it, mostly in graceful arioso phrases, ensures that the sense come across easily. Only the vocal lines for Pasiphaë, louche and languorous with a bluesy tinge, are especially characterful, but each of the leads is crisply defined nevertheless. The ending, when four of the characters come together as a Greek chorus to reflect on Icarus’s fall, is beautifully handled. Underpinning the singers there is a quirky, rather astringent eight-piece ensemble (Birmingham Contemporary Music Group), which includes an accordion and a trombone, and provides pulsing, restless accompaniments, full of ear-catching detail. Sometimes it erupts in tangled, menacing climaxes. The modern-dress staging by Orpha Phelan is effective enough, if occasionally rather fussy and twee, but the performances – led by James Cleverton as the bullying Daedalus and Margo Arsane as the pliant Icarus, with Andrew Slater as Minos, Galina Averina as Pasiphaë, Lucy Schaufer as Polycaste and William Morgan as her son Talus – are all strong. And Natalie Murray Beale’s conducting ensures that the drama, very well paced by Gordon and Plaice, packs a punch.
