2/8/2022,"A Chapel Hill cyclist who was critically injured when a driver opened his parked car door on West Franklin Street has died, friends reported Monday. Nicholas Watson, 43, died Friday, according to an update Monday on the CaringBridge website, a personal journey blog for friends and family. Several of his organs were donated to patients in need, the post noted. “His family wants to thank you for the outpouring of love and to let you know that donations will be going to help take care of his pups Fey and Poehler,” friends posted. A memorial of his life is pending at the Dead Mule Club on West Franklin Street, where Watson was a regular patron, it said. The Chapel Hill resident was critically injured Jan. 25, while riding his electric bike on West Franklin Street, Chapel Hill police reported. He was heading west, between Roberson and Graham streets, when a driver who had pulled into a parking space opened his car door to get out. Watson’s bike hit the door, and he was knocked to the ground, the police report stated. Police estimated Watson was traveling about 10 mph. He was not wearing a helmet, police spokesman Alex Carrasquillo told The News & Observer. He was taken to UNC Hospitals, where he remained in critical condition until his death. Police have not made a decision yet about whether to file charges, Carrasquillo said. The crash is the latest to put a spotlight on pedestrian and bike safety in Chapel Hill. Several children and adults in marked crosswalks and in a playground at Northside Elementary School also were injured last month in crashes involving cars. Sixteen pedestrians were hit by drivers in the town’s crosswalks last year, and some were injured or killed, Chapel Hill police also reported. The Chapel Hill Town Council is expected to get an update Wednesday on bike and pedestrian safety enforcement, which has been ramped up across town in the last few weeks. A resident also has filed a petition asking the council to approve a local “dooring” law, similar to a local ordinance that regulates cycling in Raleigh. North Carolina is one of eight states nationwide that does not have a law against dooring, in which a driver opens a car door into the path of a passing cyclist, causing the cyclist to be thrown from the bike or sometimes to swerve into oncoming traffic.

2/8/2022,"There’s a whole lot happening right under our feet, at all times of the day and night. And most of the time we never think twice about it. But under the surface where our homes and businesses lie, there’s a whole other world. A system of pipes and tunnels that makes our existence in modern society possible. Not to mention naturally forming caves. But just how deep do all of these things go? Well, one YouTube channel has given us a pretty solid idea. The folks at MetalBallStudios have created an Underground 3D comparison video, and it’s fascinating to see exactly how far down just about everything goes. You can watch the full video right here: According to the video’s official description, “These are the deepest underground structures, represented on a real scale, mines, caves, cities, tunnels, installations, etc.” They added an extra note saying “Depth is measured from the lowest point to the surface, not to sea level.” You’ll be shocked to find just how far down some of these man-made installations go. There’s a Chinese nuclear command base that goes down over 6,000 feet. And then there’s a Chinese underground laboratory that goes down 7, 870 feet below ground. And those are all just scratching the surface. Pun fully intended. And then, there’s the Kola Superdeep Borehole. The Russian project attempted to drill as deep as possible into the Earth’s crust. And for decades, it was the world’s longest borehole in terms of measured depth. But that record was destroyed in 2008, by a different hole on the other side of the world. Even though this video makes it seem like it’s the deepest, there’s always a bigger fish.

2/8/2022,"TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — A Florida prosecutor's office has concluded the fatal shooting of an 88-year-old man by a deputy was justified. The State Attorney's Office in Tampa, Florida, said Monday that the fatal shooting of Ronald Ehrich last December by a Hillsborough County deputy was justified because the deputy was in fear for her life or great bodily harm when she fired her weapon. The deputy also had no duty to retreat, the State Attorney's Office said in a statement. “Accordingly, there is no legal basis for criminal charges against the deputy,” said the statement. The deputy's name was withheld in the State Attorney's Office statement but she had previously been identified as Deputy Anastacia Castillo. Video released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office last December showed the deputy repeatedly trying to de-escalate the situation. She went to the home in Riverview, Florida, after a neighbor asked for a well-being check on Ehrich. The neighbor was concerned because she had not seen Ehrich for at least two days and had noticed his garage door was open. In the video, the deputy repeatedly identified herself as she made her way through the home, saying “sheriff’s office” as she knocked on walls and doors. Once upstairs, she opened doors to bedrooms until Ehrich finally answered from behind a closed door. She explained that she was just there to check on him. Then she apparently saw he was armed and took cover at the far end of the hallway as she called for backup. She backed into a bedroom, continuing to plead with Elrich to put the gun down. In the video, Ehrich advanced toward her and she fired after he moved within a few steps of her. Ehrich received emergency medical treatment at the scene and died at a hospital. An autopsy determined he died from gunshot wounds to the head and chest, the statement said. The investigation was conducted by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.",U.S./Associated Press,Prosecutors: Fatal deputy shooting of 88-year-old justified,https://news.yahoo.com/prosecutors-fatal-deputy-shooting-88-191910661.html
