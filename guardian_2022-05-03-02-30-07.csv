5/3/2022,"There was a smile from Unai Emery when the stats were read out to him the day before what could well the biggest night in Villarreal’s history: not just the team but the town. This season Liverpool have played 56 games and lost only three, and never by more than two goals. In other words, Jürgen Klopp’s team have not endured the kind of result that Villarreal will have to inflict upon them to progress to the Champions League final. “You’ve done a good job finding that stat,” the Villarreal coach said. “We had them but I didn’t want to say so. That shows you how difficult it will be to turn it round, but we will work on the game and see if we can. We’ll have to produce a perfect game, reach excellence or get close to it to be able to do something that no one has done to them.” Villarreal will have to be better than in the first leg certainly and Emery sees hope in playing the second leg at home. There, he said, he hopes his team can find the play that he conceded they were unable to produce in the first meeting, where they were reduced to resisting. That, though, does not necessarily mean opening up and he said his team would have to defend well – the central defender Pau Torres expressed his hope for a “long” game, saying “one goal puts us right back in it and it doesn’t matter if it’s in the first minute or the 60th”. Asked what makes the second game different, Emery said: “First, we’re at home with our fans. Second, we have to win. Third, we have to defend, but there are lots of ways of defending. We have to do a brutal defensive performance and from that base be able to find something we could not find there [in Liverpool], which is our play. Over 90 minutes, in their ground, they were favourites, they were better than us, no complaints. “It is hard to turn around a 2-0. It benefits us that there is no away goals [rule] so it’s a bit more natural to play for a win. We have to find ways of scoring. The ‘home’ factor was very important there and we would like to have a little difference in our favour here. “This is a town where of course not everyone likes football here but they do all identify with Villarreal because they have that feeling of belonging; 23,000 people will be there and we want to play to be in the final. They have a big lead but we’re not here just to end it.” Emery was reminded of a comeback his Arsenal side had produced against Rennes, in which they recovered from a 3-1 first-leg deficit to go through in the Europa League round of 16 in 2019. Although he admitted there were “certain parallels”, he said “this time the level is much higher”. He described Thiago Alcântara as offering a “tremendous” performance in the first leg, labelled Fabinho’s career path “extraordinary” and insisted Liverpool were the “best team in the world”. “We’re at home, we have to be focused, and find a great response against a very complete team, one that plays with a tremendous confidence, a feeling of superiority, one that loses very little,” he said. “We have to look for our chance, try to face them in duels and win those duels. To have got here we have needed a huge effort; now we have to try to reach excellence.”",Sport/Football,Unai Emery claims Villarreal will need ‘perfect game’ to beat Liverpool,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/02/unai-emery-says-villarreal-will-need-perfect-game-to-beat-liverpool
5/3/2022,"Organizers of the 2022 Met Gala are weathering widespread criticism for the event’s theme, “Gilded Glamor and White Tie”, facing accusation of insensitivity to the worsening inflation most Americans are dealing with. The annual gala’s sartorial theme follows the second part of curator Andrew Bolton’s two-part exhibition In America: An Anthology of Fashion, which explores the origins of American fashion. However, many onlookers have used social media to condemn Monday evening’s event for its extravagance and luxury as the nation grapples with a shrinking economy. As “Gilded Glamour and White Tie” pays homage to the period of rapid prosperity, industrialization and growth in the US from 1870 to 1890, some have called it “out of touch”. One user tweeted: “Am I the only one who thinks this years #MetGala theme is out of touch? inequality is at the highest levels since the Gilded Age, a pandemic & economic meltdown wrecked us, inflation is out of control … but cool, let’s wear #GildedAge themed dresses & laugh about inequality … this year’s theme is a slap in the face to average Americans.” Another user pointed out the irony of such a theme amid the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, writing: “Gilded glamor at a time of war, let them eat cake,” referencing a quote commonly attributed to the French queen Marie Antoinette, who during the French Revolution allegedly suggested that starving peasants lacking bread could eat cake. Last quarter, the American economy shrank for the first time since the recession that struck during the pandemic two years ago. US GDP fell by about 0.35% from January to March, or at an annualized rate of 1.4%, prompting experts to point to rising inflation, the Omicron variant and supply chain issues as factors. The rising inflation and economic contraction suggests America’s economy is at a greater risk of a downturn, especially as Russia’s war in Ukraine continues to pummel the global economy. “It’s too-on-the-nose for the Met Gala to have a ‘Gilded Age’ theme on the same day we know the US economy is contracting,” a Business Insider reporter tweeted. “The met gala this year is going to piss off people. The theme being gilded glamour??? And with everything going on this year yeah people will be mad lol,” another user tweeted. Each year, the gala draws out the rich and powerful to raise money for the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute, which is the only department at the museum that is required to raise its own funds. The cost for a seat at last year’s gala started at $35,000, although some guests on the highly selective guest list are invited free of charge. The event, which is the institute’s primary source of income, raised more than $16.4m last year. Last year’s gala also spurred controversy, as the Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wore a white gown that said “Tax the Rich”. The dress sparked backlash across the political spectrum, with critics condemning the move as both hypocritical and performative. Ocasio-Cortez defended her actions, saying: “The medium is the message.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,Met Gala organizers face criticism for ‘Gilded Glamor’ theme amid inflation,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/may/02/met-gala-theme-gilded-glamor-criticism-inflation
5/3/2022,"Trent Alexander-Arnold has called on Liverpool to crown a “very special season” with a place in the history books as Jürgen Klopp’s quadruple chasers look to secure a third Champions League final appearance in five campaigns. Liverpool visit Villarreal in the semi-finals on Tuesday leading 2-0 from the first leg with a 100% win record on the road in this season’s competition. Alexander-Arnold said in February that one trophy per season should be the minimum expectation for a squad of Liverpool’s quality. But with the team close to an unprecedented quadruple in the final month of the campaign, the 23-year-old has revised his target. “I did say one trophy a season minimum and that is in a season that isn’t our best, but we are in fine form and have been able to win in different ways,” the Liverpool right-back said. “When you are staring down the barrel and looking at more trophies, where if we win every game we are looking at more silverware, that is is what we are looking at. These kinds of games are exciting for us. “This time last year we were trying to fight back into the top four and secure the Champions League. Now we are second in the league – a point off [Manchester] City – and in the FA Cup final. Who can complain? This is a very special season for us all and hopefully we will see it through and at the end we will be in the history books again.” Alexander-Arnold says Liverpool must treat every game as a final and, despite the pressure on each fixture, believes the defining phase of a season brings the best out of Klopp’s players. “I feel like we thrive off it,” he said. “This is always the best time of the season. Every game is a final, pushing on all three fronts. These are the exciting games: you want to be playing in these, you want everything on the line, you want every game to feel like you have to win it. It is exciting, the buzz you get from scoring a goal and knowing how important it is. “Naby [Keïta]’s goal on Saturday – there was a feeling: ‘This is a big goal.’ Same with Hendo [Jordan Henderson]’s cross-shot against Villarreal. Those goals give you a different feeling that this is big, this is massive. Same with the three points. These are the best times we are going to have as a team.” Liverpool dominated Villarreal last week and restricted Unai Emery’s side to one shot, none on target. One attempt is the joint-fewest in a Champions League semi-final since the data started being recorded in 2003-04. Emery vowed Liverpool would see a different side to Villarreal in the second leg and Klopp, whose team have been behind for 69 minutes in 2022, accepts the visitors will have to suffer at times. The Liverpool manager said: “Obviously with the situation we are in we must have done something right but the problem in our job is everything is perfect and then the next game starts on the wrong foot and then all of a sudden the game gets a different dynamic. It is good to know [the 69 minutes statistic] and it is more a feeling inside, not that we are flying constantly and high-fiving here and there, but we know we are in a good moment. “But, on the other side, what would you do if you had lost 2-0 away, are maybe not happy with your performance knowing you can do better, and with the crowd behind you? My only concern is what we do tomorrow night and we have to be ready to suffer but without going down. That can happen in football matches: they have the first shot on target, the crowd goes up, with each challenge the crowd goes up again. A good example was Newcastle. The crowd was obviously very passionate but we did not let it happen, which was the biggest quality of this game. “It was not a show of football brilliance or whatever – we had our moments and of course could have scored more goals – but it was incredible how clearcut our performance was and that’s what we have to be again. Yes emotional, yes ready to play the best game ever, but knowing it will not happen in all moments. Suffering doesn’t mean you suffer for long, it means you suffer [clicks fingers] and then react. And that is what we have to do.”",Sport/Football,Alexander-Arnold calls on Liverpool to make history with quadruple in sight,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/02/alexander-arnold-calls-on-liverpool-to-make-history-with-quadruple-in-sight
5/3/2022,"Mundher Al-Adhami, who has died suddenly aged 79, was a maths teacher who moved into research and development. In this work he focused on the structure of progression in learning and on constructing lessons that encourage active engagement in mathematical thinking for all children. A passionate intellectual activist and writer, Mundher was always trying to understand the world and working to improve it, whether in education or Middle Eastern politics. He was a generous collaborator and stimulating friend. Born in Baghdad, he was one of 16 children of Fatima Jawad Asia and Nouman Mohammed Al-Adhami, a grain wholesaler. After attending Markazia high school, he left Iraq to study geophysics at the universities of Moscow and Durham. Throughout his life, he was involved in publishing for and leading Iraqi and Palestinian solidarity movements, and was a member of the BRussells tribunal on the Iraq war. With his second wife, Haifa Zangana, whom he met at a political demonstration in 1988 and married in 1992, he later endowed prizes for Iraqi writers. He had several temporary teaching posts in Durham but the first permanent post was at Elliott school in Putney, south-west London, where he moved to in 1974, then John Archer school in Wandsworth, which later merged into Wandsworth school. When I first met him, he was head of maths there. He then moved to become a key member of the project team of graded assessment in mathematics (Gaim) at King’s College London, developing a teacher-assessed scheme for 11- to 16-year-olds that could be traded in for a final GCSE grade. The job involved researching and trialling a framework of progression in understanding, partly assessed by individual and group problem-solving, and later administering the Gaim GCSE. Two related projects at King’s followed, one secondary and one primary, on cognitive acceleration in mathematics education (Came), working with teachers to develop crafted “thinking maths” lessons based on the Gaim framework and informed by cognitive psychology. All these projects gave rise to published teacher resources and academic books and papers, to which Mundher richly contributed. He continued as chief executive of the educational consultancy Cognitive Acceleration Associates, and founder of the charity Let’s Think Forum, working with schools to improve their teaching of maths. While latterly enjoying his winters in Tunisia, Mundher continued writing, editing and collaborating internationally right up to his death, contributing with his customary wisdom, humanity and passion to both politics and maths teaching. He is survived by Haifa, his two children, Youssef and Rheem, from his first marriage to Helen (nee Vesey), from whom he was divorced, four grandchildren, a stepdaughter, and 10 of his 15 siblings.",News/Education,Mundher Al-Adhami obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/02/mundher-al-adhami-obituary
5/3/2022,"One of the UK’s most wanted men has been arrested after trying to fly to Portugal using a fraudulent passport. Alex Male, 29, of Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, is alleged to have been a regional distributor of class A drugs across the south-west of England, using an EncroChat encrypted communications network. He was detained at Lisbon airport after arriving on a flight from Turkey where he had been refused entry, according to the National Crime Agency. Male, who was added to the NCA’s most-wanted list in January, is accused of conspiracy to supply cocaine and ketamine, money laundering and conspiracy to acquire a firearm as part of his alleged drug-dealing activity between April and June 2020. He had been on the run after failing to adhere to the bail restrictions imposed after his arrest and was previously thought to be in the Marbella area of Spain before moving to Portugal. The NCA international liaison officer, Phil Robinson, said: “Male naively believed he could travel across international borders using fraudulent documentation and remain undetected by law enforcement. But he underestimated the vigilance and expertise of the Turkish border police, which enabled the Portuguese authorities to act. “Any arrest of a fugitive is a fantastic result, even more so since Male had only recently been added to our most-wanted list. “He is wanted in connection with dangerous crimes, which have a devastating impact on communities, so I’m delighted he has been caught. We continue to work with our international partners to close the net around fugitives, no matter where they are.” Male, who was initially detained at Lisbon airport on Saturday, remains in custody and will face extradition proceedings. DI Adrian Hawkins of the south-west regional organised crime unit said: “Male will now be returned to the criminal justice system in the UK to face the charges he ran away from. This is an example of international law enforcement working together to ensure justice can be done and demonstrating there is nowhere safe to hide.” The NCA is the UK’s lead agency against serious and organised crime.",News/UK news,One of UK’s most wanted men arrested at Lisbon airport,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/02/alex-male-arrested-lisbon-one-of-uk-most-wanted-men
5/3/2022,"Bernardine Evaristo rightly highlights the way that Black female artists, writers and actors are finally getting public attention (‘They are totally smashing it!’ Bernardine Evaristo on the artistic triumph of older Black women, 28 April). But the belated recognition of the role of Black women in the arts and as uncompromising “troublemakers” in the UK needs to go back at least a generation. For example, Trinidad-born Pearl Prescod was the first Black female actor at the National Theatre, in Olivier’s production of Arthur Miller’s The Crucible in 1965. In 1963, with Claudia Jones and other Black artists, who, like her, merged the personal, political and professional, she led the anti-racist march to the US embassy in London in solidarity with Martin Luther King’s March on Washington, singing We Shall Overcome. The Institute of Race Relations is working on a project to commemorate her contribution as singer, actor, writer and organiser. However, she is but one of a whole generation from the 1950s and 1960s who should not be forgotten and written out of history.Anya Edmond-PettittCoordinator, IRR Black History Collection  Bernardine Evaristo rightly draws attention to Black females working in the arts. Sadly, there was no mention of Sharon Walters, who, through her collage series Seeing Ourselves, explores the under-representation of Black women in the arts and heritage sectors and mainstream media.
