3/15/2022,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — U.S. astronaut Mark Vande Hei has made it through nearly a year in space, but faces what could be his trickiest assignment yet: riding a Russian capsule back to Earth in the midst of deepening tensions between the countries. NASA insists Vande Hei’s homecoming plans at the end of the month remain unchanged, even as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has resulted in canceled launches, broken contracts and an escalating war of words by the Russian Space Agency’s hardline leader. Many worry Dmitry Rogozin is putting decades of a peaceful off-the-planet partnership at risk, most notably at the International Space Station. Vande Hei — who on Tuesday breaks the U.S. single spaceflight record of 340 days — is due to leave with two Russians aboard a Soyuz capsule for a touchdown in Kazakhstan on March 30. The astronaut will have logged 355 days in space by then, setting a new U.S. record. The world record of 438 continuous days in space belongs to Russia. Retired NASA astronaut Scott Kelly, America’s record-holder until Tuesday, is among those sparring with Rogozin, a longtime ally of Vladimir Putin. Enraged by what's going on in Ukraine, Kelly has returned his Russian medal for space exploration to the Russian Embassy in Washington. Despite the deadly conflict down here, Kelly believes the two sides “can hold it together” up in space. “We need an example set that two countries that historically have not been on the most friendly of terms, can still work somewhere peacefully. And that somewhere is the International Space Station. That’s why we need to fight to keep it,” Kelly told The Associated Press. NASA wants to keep the space station running until 2030, as do the European, Japanese and Canadian space agencies, while the Russians have not committed beyond the original end date of 2024 or so. The U.S. and Russia are the prime operators of the orbiting outpost, permanently occupied for 21 years. Until SpaceX started launching astronauts in 2020, Americans regularly hitched rides on Russian Soyuz capsules for tens of millions of dollars per seat. The U.S. and Russian space agencies are still working on a long-term barter system in which a Russian would launch on a SpaceX capsule beginning this fall and an American would fly up on the Soyuz. That would help ensure a U.S. and Russian station presence at all times. Vande Hei, 55, a retired Army colonel, moved into the space station last April, launching on a Soyuz from Kazakhstan with Pyotr Dubrov and another Russian. He and Dubrov stayed twice as long as usual to accommodate a Russian film crew that visited in October. As the situation 260 miles (420 kilometers) below intensified last month, Vande Hei acknowledged he was avoiding conversations about Ukraine with Dubrov and Anton Shkaplerov, their Russian commander. Three more Russians will blast off from Kazakhstan on Friday to replace them. “We haven’t talked about that too much. I’m not sure we really want to go there,” Vande Hei told a TV interviewer in mid-February. Space station operations continue as always — in orbit and on Earth, according to NASA. “It would be a sad day for international operations if we can’t continue to peacefully operate in space,” said NASA’s human spaceflight chief Kathy Lueders, who noted it would be “very difficult” to go it alone. To mark Tuesday’s milestone, NASA turned to Twitter to gather questions for video-recorded responses, and some asked whether Vande Hei might switch to an American ride home. SpaceX is taking three wealthy businessmen and their ex-astronaut escort to the space station at the end of March for a brief visit. Then in mid-April, SpaceX will deliver four astronauts for NASA before bringing back four who have been on board since November. NASA and SpaceX officials refuse to speculate on whether a seat could be made available. They say a NASA plane and small team will be on hand in Kazakhstan, as usual, to whisk Vande Hei back home to Houston. Former NASA astronaut Heidemarie Stefanyshyn-Piper, whose father was born in Ukraine, concedes it’s a difficult situation. “We’re sanctioning Russia. Companies are pulling out of doing business in Russia. But then yet you still have the U.S. government — the space agency — doing business with the Russians,” she said. “You can’t push a button and separate the two” sides of the space station. Besides threatening to pull out of the space station and drop it on the U.S., Europe or elsewhere, Rogozin had the flags of other countries covered on a Soyuz rocket awaiting liftoff with internet satellites earlier this month. The launch was called off, after the customer, London-based OneWeb, refused his demands that the satellites not be used for military purposes and the British government halt its financial backing. The European Space Agency also is reeling. After missing a 2020 launch deadline for its Mars rover — a joint European-Russian effort — the project was on track for a September liftoff from Kazakhstan. Now it’s most likely off until 2024, the next opportunity for Earth and Mars to be properly aligned. And Russia has pulled its staff out of the French-run launch site in South America, suspending Soyuz launches of European satellites. All this comes on top of the Russian government's antisatellite missile test in November that added countless pieces of junk to the debris already encircling Earth and put the space station's four Americans, two Russians and one German on alert for days. Jeffrey Manber, now with the private Voyager Space company, helped forge U.S. and Russian ties back in the mid-1990s, with the first piece of the space station launching in 1998. He sees the outpost as “one of the final holdouts of collaboration” between the two countries. But, he added, “there is no going back if the partnership is ended and the result is a premature ending of the ISS program.” Regardless of how things play out at the space station, John Logsdon, professor emeritus at George Washington University, expects it will mark the end of large-scale space cooperation between Russia and the West. “Russia has been moving toward China already, and the current situation will probably accelerate that move,” he said. While Vande Hei has been silent on Twitter, Kelly and others have gone into overdrive, taking offense at Rogozin's threats. Elon Musk's private SpaceX took a swipe at Rogozin after he said Russia would stop supplying rocket engines to U.S. companies — Northrop Grumman and United Launch Alliance — adding they could use broomsticks to get to orbit. At a launch last week, a SpaceX official responded: “Time to let the American broomstick fly and hear the sounds of freedom.” ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

3/15/2022,"* 12 missiles hit Erbil, some land near new U.S. consulate * Missiles caused only material damage, one civilian injured * No damage to U.S. facilities, U.S. State Dept spokesman says * Iraqi security official says missiles made in Iran * Iran's Revolutionary Guards claim responsibility for attack (Adds Iraq summons Iran ambassador, context) By Amina Ismail and John Davison ERBIL, Iraq, March 13 (Reuters) - Iran attacked Iraq's northern city of Erbil on Sunday with a dozen ballistic missiles in an unprecedented assault on the capital of the autonomous Iraqi Kurdish region that appeared to target the United States and its allies. The missiles came down in areas near a new U.S. consulate building, according to Kurdish officials. U.S. officials said no Americans were hurt and nor were U.S. facilities hit. Kurdish authorities said only one civilian was hurt and no one killed. Iranian state media said Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps carried out the attack against Israeli ""strategic centres"" in Erbil, suggesting it was revenge for recent Israeli air strikes that killed Iranian military personnel in Syria. The attack, in which huge blasts shook windows of homes in Erbil after midnight, was a rare publicly declared assault by Tehran against allies of Washington. The last time Iran fired missiles directly at U.S. facilities was when it struck the Ain Al Asad air base in western Iraq in January 2020 - a retaliation for the U.S. killing of Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani. Sunday's attack comes as talks to revive the 2015 Iran nuclear deal face the prospect of collapse after a last-minute Russian demand forced world powers to pause negotiations for an undetermined time despite having a largely completed text. It also comes days after Israel carried out an air raid in Syria which the IRGC said killed two of its members and for which it vowed retaliation. 'RESPONSE TO ISRAEL' The IRGC issued a statement about Sunday's attack which was reported by Iranian state media. ""Any repetition of attacks by Israel will be met with a harsh, decisive and destructive response,"" it said. The Iraqi Kurdish regional government said the attack only targeted civilian residential areas, not sites belonging to foreign countries, and called on the international community to carry out an investigation. Iraq's foreign ministry summoned the Iranian ambassador to Baghdad in protest. A U.S. State Department spokesperson called it an ""outrageous attack"" but said no Americans were hurt and there was no damage to U.S. government facilities in Erbil. France's foreign ministry said the move threatened efforts to conclude nuclear talks with Iran. In another sign of derailing regional diplomacy, Iran said on Sunday it was suspending a fifth round of talks due this week in Baghdad with regional rival Saudi Arabia. U.S. forces stationed in a section of the Erbil International Airport complex have in the past come under fire from rocket and drone attacks that Washington blames on Iran-aligned militia groups, but no such attacks have occurred for several months. Asked about Sunday's attack, Israel's military said it did not comment on reports in the foreign press and the prime minister's office declined to comment. BATTLEFIELD IRAQ Iran has not fired ballistic missiles at U.S. forces since its January 2020 retaliation attack after the U.S. killing earlier that month of Soleimani at Baghdad airport. No U.S. personnel were killed in that attack but many suffered head injuries. Iran-backed Shi'ite Islamist militias have since Soleimani's death regularly attacked U.S. forces stationed in Iraq and neighbouring Syria. Washington has on occasion retaliated with air strikes. Some observers said Sunday's attack was retaliation against Israel and not aimed at the United States. ""Iran had carried out attacks against American targets and did not shy away from publicizing this,"" said Hamidreza Azizi, Visiting Fellow at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. ""I see this more as a warning sign to Israel and a show of force in the negotiations."" Iraq has been rocked by chronic instability since the defeat of the Sunni Islamist group Islamic State in 2017 by a loose coalition of Iraqi, U.S.-led and Iran-backed forces. Since then, Iran-aligned militias have regularly attacked U.S. military and diplomatic sites in Iraq, U.S. and many Iraqi officials say. Iran denies involvement in those attacks.

3/15/2022,"BERLIN (AP) — Germany said Monday that it will replace some of its aging Tornado bomber jets with U.S.-made F-35A Lightning II aircraft capable of carrying nuclear weapons. Announcing the decision, Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said Germany also will upgrade its Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets for electronic warfare — a capability that's also currently fulfilled by the Tornado jets. The Eurofighter will be replaced from 2040 with the Future Combat Air System, or FCAS, that's being jointly developed with France and Spain, she said. Germany's air force commander, Ingo Gerhartz, said the current war in Ukraine made it necessary to choose Lockheed Martin's F-35s. Previously, the government had considered replacing the Luftwaffe's Tornados with a mix of different U.S. and European-made aircraft. “There can be only one answer to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's aggression,” said Gerhartz. “Unity in NATO and a credible deterrent. This in particular means there is no alternative but to choose the F-35.” The German military does not have nuclear weapons of its own, but as part of the system of nuclear deterrence developed during the Cold War it maintained bombers capable of carrying U.S. atomic bombs, some of which are stationed in Germany. The opposition Left Party criticized the decision to purchase almost three dozen F-35s for Germany's military. “We reject arming the Bundeswehr with new, nuclear-capable combat jets,” said Ali Al-Dailami, the party's deputy defense spokesman. He warned that equipping German pilots to drop U.S. atomic bombs could “fuel the risk of nuclear war in Europe.” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced last month that the country would create a special fund of 100 billion euros ($113 billion) to bolster its armed forces and raise defense spending above 2% of gross domestic product, a measure on which it had long lagged behind other NATO countries on.",World/Associated Press,Germany to buy US-made F-35s to replace aging bombers,https://news.yahoo.com/germany-buy-us-made-f-143016611.html
3/15/2022,"Over the weekend, family and friends of Empire star Jussie Smollett spoke out in support of their loved one, demanding his freedom from jail and maintaining his innocence.
 As previously reported by The Root, on March 10, Smollett was sentenced to 150 days in Cook County jail in Chicago, 30 months of felony probation with no travel restrictions, and ordered to pay over $120,000 in restitution to the city of Chicago and a $25,000 fine. Since then, his official Instagram account has been taken over by his family, who have shared posts with updates on how their brother’s faring and the overwhelming message of #FreeJussie.

Toasted: Jerk Chicken Empanadas and Mango Chili Sauce Smollett’s sister, Jurnee, who recently starred in the critically-acclaimed HBO series Lovecraft Country, spoke out in defense of her brother, writing online: “Black Americans are incarcerated in state prisons at nearly five times the rate of White Americans. Jussie is innocent. And…you don’t have to believe in his innocence to believe he should be free. #FreeJussie #StopLockingUpOurPeople.” Smollett’s Empire costar Taraji P. Henson also spoke out on the sentencing, adding her support for the star and invoking Emmett Till. “I am not here to debate you on his innocence but we can agree that the punishment does not fit the crime,” Henson began in her post. She continued: Emmett Till was brutally beat and ultimately murdered because of a lie and none of the people involved with his demise spent one day in jail, even after Carolyn Bryant admitted that her claims were false. No one was hurt or killed during Jussie’s ordeal. He has already lost everything, EVERYTHING! To me as an artist not able to create that in itself is punishment enough. He can’t get a job. No one in Hollywood will hire him and again as an artist who loves to create, that is prison. My prayer is that he is freed and put on house arrest and probation because in this case that would seem fair. Please #freejussie .

3/15/2022,"Police in New York City are searching for a woman who shoved a renowned 87-year-old singing coach from behind, sending her to the hospital in critical condition. The New York Police Department released a video of the suspect, who was wearing a dark jacket and long white dress and had long rust-colored hair, at the time of the Thursday night attack. Police said the suspect approached the victim near West 28th Street and 8th Avenue and pushed her from behind, causing her to fall and hit her head. The suspect fled toward 9th Avenue. The grandson of the victim wrote on Facebook that his grandmother, Barbara Maier Gustern, had ""suffered traumatic damage to the left side of her brain, and has been unconscious the entire time."" ""Should she awake, she will most likely suffer speech problems and may be unable to move her right side. It is a very serious injury,"" wrote the grandson, who identified himself as AJ. Gustern is fondly regarded in New York's theater community. She coached the cast of the 2019 Broadway revival of the musical ""Oklahoma!,"" The New York Times reported. She also once coached rock singer Debbie Harry of the group Blondie. Friends told the newspaper that Gustern was headed to Joe’s Pub at the Public Theater on Thursday to see one of her students perform. A group rehearsing a cabaret show in her apartment earlier in the evening said they found Gustern outside her lobby door covered in blood. A bicyclist had helped her back to her building after the attack. Earlier in the day, Gustern shared on Facebook that she had been feeling detached from her singing. But she was starting to feel better, she wrote, excited for that evening's rehearsal and an upcoming show at Don’t Tell Mama in Hell's Kitchen. The next post on her page was the one from Gustern's grandson. ""I would ask not trying to visit her, it is an ongoing investigation and the police don’t want anybody but family visiting. And none of you want to see her like this, believe me,"" he wrote to her friends. He added that he was ""incomprehensibly broken inside.""
