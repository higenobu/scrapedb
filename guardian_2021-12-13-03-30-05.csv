12/13/2021,"The ash is one of Britain’s most recognisable and common trees. Tall and elegantly canopied, it is also one of its most beautiful, with its pale, feathered leaves and its fruits – its “ash keys” – hanging from its branches like real bunches of keys dangling from a caretaker’s belt. The late emergence of the leaves of ash trees allows species such as dog violet and mercury to thrive beneath them. Woodpeckers, owls and nuthatches nest in them. Lichens, moss and liverworts grow happily on them. Friendly fungi – such as the marvellously named King Alfred’s cakes – flourish upon them. The National Trust reports that 30,000 ash trees on its land will have been felled this year owing to ash dieback. “Dieback” sounds like a gentle, seasonal withdrawal. In fact, ash dieback is a devastating disease caused by a fungus, Hymenoscyphus fraxineus, likely to have been carried into the UK on imported ash saplings in the early part of this century. A ban came on such imports in 2012 – too late to do much but slow the fungus’s spread. When affected by the gradually developing ailment, the leaves of the ash wither and blacken, and lesions develop on the branches; eventually the tree dies.  The skeletal, bleached remains of ashes, denuded of their glorious foliage, is already an all-too common sight. The Woodland Trust predicts that ash dieback will eventually kill 80% of ash trees. The scale of this is hard to comprehend: the government estimates there are 125m ash trees in woodlands alone in the UK. English landscapes such as the Mendips and the White Peak, now ash-dominated, will be drastically transformed. And losing ashes means not only losing trees but the habitat they provide. The ash has an ineradicable place in European folklore. In Greek mythology, it was of ash felled from Mount Pelion that Achilles’s spear was made – the one he used to kill Hector in Homer’s Iliad. (Even now its hard timber is reckoned good for tough objects, such as hammers and walking sticks.) In Norse myths, a great ash, Yggdrasil, grew at the heart of the world. The Norns – the ancient female deities that allotted the fate of humankind – dwelt among its roots; the gods held their courts among its branches. The 18th-century English naturalist Gilbert White reported a folk remedy for children with weak or ruptured limbs, perhaps a late survival from British pagan beliefs. Climate change has helped the spread of arboreal diseases. A small percentage of ash trees appear to have immunity to the disease: it is here that hope lies for an eventual regeneration of the generously self-seeding ash, especially if the spread of the fungus is slowed as much as possible. Meanwhile, it is time to pay attention to, and make the most of, the noble ash, and perhaps do as Wordsworth once did, when he watched the moon “couched among the leaves / Of a tall ash, that near our cottage stood / Had watched her with fixed eyes, while to and from / In the dark summit of the moving tree / She rocked with every impulse of the wind.”",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on ash dieback: a tiny chink of hope | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/12/the-guardian-view-on-ash-dieback-a-tiny-chink-of-hope
12/13/2021,"Boris Johnson has long been considered a king of comebacks. And some Tory MPs hope he’ll continue that streak by managing to rescue himself from plummeting poll ratings in the wake of a string of Downing Street parties in defiance of Covid laws. The prime minister had tangled himself in knots by repeatedly denying any rules were broken before more reports and evidence emerged to suggest the opposite.  First there was the video of No 10 aides laughing while they discussed a Christmas gathering on 18 December last year. Then Dominic Cummings, once Johnson’s closest adviser, promised pictures had been taken of parties, and so with bated breath critics of the government waited for them to surface. When an image was published on Sunday showing Johnson on a screen hosting a Christmas quiz for staffers tuning in from No 10 and at home, it was not quite the smoking gun some thought would finally skewer him, however. The Sunday Mirror image shows Johnson with two aides who were dressed up with tinsel and a Santa hat – not socially distanced from one another, and clearly engaged in a social occasion while mixing households. But it could have been worse. There have been other parties hosted in No 10 and Conservative party headquarters in which people drank copious amounts of alcohol, played party games, exchanged secret Santa gifts and socialised into the small hours, sources have told media outlets including the Guardian, Mirror, BBC and Times. Ministers will quietly breath a sigh of relief no pictures of these scenes have been leaked – yet. While Johnson’s attendance at the quiz broke the rules, according to Keir Starmer, the Labour leader and a former director of public prosecutions, Tory MPs think people will look at the photo and judge that it really shows him hosting a virtual quiz – a familiar sight during the pandemic. The staff, dialling in from other rooms in No 10 while drinking and not socially distancing, cannot be seen. On Sunday Nadhim Zahawi insisted the picture was just an example of Johnson “thanking his staff” and used it to play down the party scandal as “hype”. He told LBC: “On that front page, I think your listeners will look at that and see a PM in his office, with the two close people that work with him, with no alcohol, taking 10 to 15 minutes to thank and motivate his staff, who have been coming in because they can’t work from home.” Much damage has already been done, with mutinous MPs furious at the prime minister allowing a “one rule for them” narrative to take hold, from Cummings to Matt Hancock and more recently Owen Paterson. Johnson is teetering on the edge of favour with his own MPs; if further photos surface, they may push him over the edge.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson teeters on edge of favour with Tory MPs,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/12/boris-johnson-teeters-on-edge-of-favour-with-tory-mps
12/13/2021,"Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad are “fit and ready to go” for the pink-ball Test starting on Thursday in Adelaide, when England will attempt to end Australia’s perfect home record in day-night matches and revive a faltering Ashes campaign. The pair’s absence from the nine-wicket defeat in Brisbane dominated the post-match inquest. Anderson’s buildup period was limited after an early calf niggle on tour while Broad was overlooked for the subsequently mauled left-arm spin of Jack Leach.  But Chris Silverwood, a head coach-cum-selector under mounting pressure after one victory in 10, has confirmed the pair’s readiness to face an Australia side who have won all eight of their floodlit Tests at home. “They are available, yes,” Silverwood said on Sunday, 24 hours before the team’s journey to Adelaide. “Jimmy will be fit and ready to go for the second Test, as will Stuart. [But] I have not told anyone they are playing yet. “The guys have already been training with the pink ball behind the scenes. And what we have got is a very skilful set of bowlers. We have talent and we still have two of the best up our sleeve as well.” Australia are also mulling a significant change: Josh Hazlewood has 28 wickets at 18 from five day-night Adelaide Tests but has flown to Sydney nursing a “mild” side strain. The pacy outswing of Jhye Richardson should step up here, if not Michael Neser after match figures of seven for 65 helped to beat an England Lions side in Queensland, despite 113 from James Bracey. David Warner, suspected if not confirmed to have sustained a cracked rib when struck by a Ben Stokes short ball in Brisbane, will likely be given painkilling injections and hidden in the field to open at a ground where he averages 80. If the 35-year-old really struggles in training this week, Usman Khawaja is the spare batter in the squad. England have endured three defeats in three floodlit Tests overseas to date, most recently a two-day thrashing against India in Ahmedabad this year when they completely misread conditions, picked frontline three seamers – plus Stokes – yet spin dominated and Joe Root claimed five for eight with his off-breaks. Like then, Silverwood and his captain appear to be placing huge stock in the pink ball swinging under lights for Anderson and his teammates. Whether one or both veterans slot back in, a possible all-seam approach looms after Leach’s 13 overs at the Gabba were ruthlessly targeted to the tune of 102 runs. Broad’s return, and potential reunion with Warner after dominating him at home in 2019, would mean one of Chris Woakes, Ollie Robinson or Mark Wood missing out. Each ultimately held their own in Brisbane, however: Robinson the standout with match figures of four for 71, Wood beating the bat 24 times and picking up two wickets, and Woakes the most qualified No 8 in the squad. Much will hinge on how Wood pulls up after 25.4 overs of sustained speeds, with Silverwood citing a need to look after their one “out-and-out pace bowler” given the absence of Jofra Archer and Olly Stone. If rested, however, it would mean a unvaried right-arm fast-medium attack and little by way of physical intimidation. Either way, no spinner would challenge an over rate that has already cost England’s players their match fees and the team five World Test Championship points. Silverwood stressed this was a collective issue in the field and claimed the points deduction hurt more than losing around £14,500 a man. Along with praising the chosen seamers, Silverwood praised Broad’s response to being left out initially. This appears to differ from his previous omission – in the first Test against West Indies in 2020 – when the now 35-year-old felt personally affronted and returned for a golden summer. England’s frustration stems chiefly from ragged periods in the field at the Gabba and a batting lineup that, while supposedly working to a mantra of big totals, has passed 400 just once in their last 19 innings. Root this year has scored 1,052 more runs than the next best Englishman, Rory Burns, and they remain the side’s only centurions in 2021. Asked about the dearth of batsmen – Root is the only England player to make a Test debut since 2012 and average more than 40 – Silverwood replied: “It is part of my role to take the criticism because the buck stops with me. I have no problem with that and it is how it should be, but we have to work with what we have got.” This represented an honest if stark admission for the head coach, who has spent two years planning for this tour but now finds himself hoping the possible vagaries of pink-ball cricket can level a series that Australia lead 1-0.",Sport/Sport,Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad ‘fit and ready’ for second Ashes Test,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/12/cricket-england-jimmy-anderson-stuart-broad-ashes
12/13/2021,"My husband, Peter Wilmers, who has died aged 72, was a pioneer of community greening whose work helped transform the Lancashire valley of Rossendale and inspired a national movement. A creative worker for the environment, he had a rare combination of strategic vision and an ability to get things done. In 1983, Peter moved as a planner from Norfolk to Lancashire to lead Rossendale Groundwork, a not-for-profit environmental charity based on local partnerships, supported by the Countryside Commission. Rossendale, a Pennine valley with high unemployment and a degraded landscape, was not home to the first Groundwork trust, but Peter, with energy and political skill, established the Rossendale organisation as a model of what Groundwork could achieve.  Work focused on “New Landscapes” and “New Lives”. For 10 years, Groundwork was the third largest employer in the valley. Training schemes exceeded expectations; local footpaths and walls were restored; a derelict building became a visitor centre; and 22,000 trees a year were planted. Perceptions changed with community involvement. Peter played a major role in getting ministers to support a national rollout of Groundwork. The local MP, Sir David Trippier, emerged as a champion for the wider movement and the federation continues today as a national force for regeneration. Sporting his green suits and red shoe laces, Peter attracted the great and the good while pioneering many innovative programmes. He led Groundwork’s expansion into east Lancashire and Bury in the 1990s. In Blackburn, a derelict canal building became a flagship centre; a £5m grant transformed wastelands around a deprived estate. “Youth Works” programmes targeted youth crime. He set up the UK’s first business environmental audit programme, enabling small businesses to reduce their environmental impact and costs. This led to work in Hungary and Poland and conference presentations across Europe, in Beijing and New York. By 2003 Peter was managing four Groundwork organisations. At the North West Development Agency, to which he moved in 2005, he championed “green infrastructure”, proposing investment in functional green space to sit alongside other infrastructure programmes. He helped Natural England reveal and celebrate the economic benefits of nature. This approach, pioneered through Natural Economy Northwest, is now established. Peter retired in 2010. For 15 years he was a governor of Cribden House school, Rawtenstall. He actively participated on the board of Rossendale Leisure Trust and the Whitaker Museum until his death. Born in Clapham, south London, Peter was the son of June (nee Mecredy), who taught English as a foreign language, and John Wilmers, a QC. He attended and was influenced by Leighton Park, a Quaker school in Reading, from which he went on to study social science at Leicester University and postgraduate planning at Nottingham University. Talented and multifaceted, Peter sparkled. His legacy continues in the landscape and the people changed and inspired by his work. Peter was married first to Sue Biffen and then to Kath Long, with whom he had two sons, Tom and Harry. Both marriages ended in divorce, and Harry predeceased him. Peter and I met in 1987, and married four years later; he is also survived by Tom, his grandchildren, Hugo and Clara, and June.",News/Society,Peter Wilmers obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/12/peter-wilmers-obituary
12/13/2021,"Leading scientists have called for the vaccination of younger children to allow as many as possible to stay in school next year as Omicron cases rise dramatically across the UK. Prof Peter Openshaw, a member of the government’s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said that without vaccinating children there could be further huge disruption to education and that health concerns about infection now outweighed initial justified caution in extending vaccination to five- to 11-year-olds.  “There was more uncertainty earlier. It’s now becoming clearer that vaccination is generally safe and that it’s better to be vaccinated than to be infected,” he said. “To my mind it’s clear: the safest option is to be vaccinated.” Deepti Gurdasani, clinical epidemiologist and senior lecturer at Queen Mary University of London, said that schooling would “not be feasible” next year without extending the vaccination programme to primary school age groups. “There’s been no discussion of how we’re going to protect children in January when schools reopen,” she said. “The US has vaccinated five million children. The EMA [European Medicines Agency] has approved, FDA [US Food and Drug Administration] has approved, there’s no word from the MHRA [the UK regulator] which is quite stunning.” Openshaw said that there is some evidence that Omicron is reproducing more efficiently in younger age groups, meaning that the vaccination of children could be especially important. It is not clear whether extending vaccination to primary school children would be able to happen quickly enough to affect the oncoming wave of cases, which is expected to peak early next year. But Openshaw added: “The ‘too late’ argument is not a good one. We’d always prefer to have done something three months ago. The second best time is now.” The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is currently reviewing data on Covid jabs for children over five as a “matter of urgency” and expected to give a recommendation if the UK’s medicine regulator gives the green light for vaccines to be administered to younger age groups. June Raine, chief executive of the MHRA, has said that it is “very likely” an assessment of whether to approve the Pfizer vaccine for children as young as five would be concluded before Christmas. The FDA authorised the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine for use among 5- to 11-year-olds in late October, and the EU’s regulator, the EMA, followed suit in November. Previously, the JCVI said that the use of vaccines for healthy children could not be recommended on health grounds alone, saying that children were at such low risk from the virus that vaccines would offer only a marginal benefit to them. This had to be weighed against the possibility of an extremely rare side effect of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines that causes heart inflammation. However, as more data has become available, including the vaccination of 5 million five- to 11-year-olds in the US with no reports of myocarditis or other red flags, the argument for vaccinating children has become more compelling, Openshaw said. “I’m very concerned about what the long-term effects of infection with Sars-CoV-2 will be on health and wellbeing for children,” he said. “We don’t know yet what twists and turns this virus might have.” Kit Yates, senior lecturer in mathematical biology at the University of Bath, said: “Once the MHRA have given their approval for the vaccine for five- to 11-year-olds we should be rolling out the offer of vaccination to that age group quickly. The evidence from the trials and the real world administration of the vaccine to children across the world have demonstrated it to be safe and effective.” Yates added: “Whilst children do seem, so far, to have suffered less sever consequence of Covid than older age groups, it is not the case that children do not get ill or die from Covid. Certainly, fears that new variants might affect children more severely, have focused attention back on the issue of vaccinating children for children’s sake rather than simply to protect others.” ",News/World news,"Vaccinate five- to 11-year-olds to protect UK schools, scientists say",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/12/vaccinate-five-to-11-year-olds-protect-uk-schools-scientists-covid-omicron-children
12/13/2021,"Tuesday’s Premier League match between Brentford and Manchester United has been placed in doubt after a number of Ralf Rangnick’s squad tested positive for Covid-19. United won 1-0 at Norwich on Saturday, with a late penalty from Cristiano Ronaldo. Everyone who travelled to Carrow Road had tested negative in the last round of routine tests. But on Sunday morning, a small number of positive lateral flow tests were found among the players and staff, who were all sent home. The rest of the squad trained outdoors and the schedule was adjusted, taking in individual and non-contact sessions.  It is understood the Premier League has been notified of the results by United and it is not clear if Tuesday night’s match at Brentford will be able to go ahead.

12/13/2021,"John Midwinter, who has died aged 83, did much to transform telecommunications from a simple phone-based service in the 1970s to the full broadband and internet network that we have today. Before such services came from the privatised British Telecom, the state provider was the General Post Office: during John’s time at the GPO research laboratory (1971-84), he shaped the understanding, design and development of the first optical fibre communications systems and their introduction into the UK network. In the process he helped Britain lead the world in establishing optical communications as a fast-moving and competitive research area.  When, in 1966, Charles Kao of Standard Telecommunication Laboratories proposed the idea of optical fibres – strands of glass as thin as a hair carrying communications traffic – the challenges were huge, and struck many as insurmountable. A full system called for the design of optical transmitters and receivers, reliable lasers to generate pulses of light, techniques to modulate and demodulate data, and a better understanding of the physics of data-carrying optical pulses propagating in glass. However, John, as head of what became the GPO’s optical communications division, set about developing a complete system carrying live traffic. In 1977 the world’s first optical fibre system was installed between Martlesham and Kesgrave, in Suffolk, with members of his research team splicing fibres in the snow, sleet and rain, to successfully demonstrate the transmission of data over approximately 8km of fibre. The next problem was to significantly extend the length of these systems. This involved the use of mono-mode fibres of a much smaller diameter core, supporting a single path for the light to follow. Data-carrying pulses of light could be prevented from spreading, so allowing much higher data rates over longer distances. This went against conventional wisdom, which held that it would be impossible to join such thin, fragile fibres. However, by the early 80s, John’s group achieved this feat, sending data at four times the rate over a distance of 60km. British Telecom, as it was from 1980, stopped all work on competing technologies and in 1984 became the first telecommunication operator to switch entirely to single-mode fibre systems. The rest of the world soon followed, with the help of John’s textbook, Optical Fibres for Transmission (1979). As a result of his work, today more than 95% of all data is transmitted over optical fibres and more than 500m kilometres of fibre are installed each year on land or under the sea. In 1984 Eric Ash, head of the department of electronic and electrical engineering at University College London, recruited John as BT professor of optoelectronics. At UCL John focused his research on exploring whether photons could be used to carry out processing functions in order to design, for example, an optical computer. But while photons were excellent for transmission, electrons proved better for switching and other digital functions. By the early 90s, John returned to research on optical communications, exploring the use of multiple wavelengths or colours for the routing of optical information. He was elected to the fellowship of Engineering (now RAEng) and appointed OBE (both 1984), and became fellow of the Royal Society (1985). He succeeded Ash as head of the department in 1988 and a year later became Pender professor of electrical engineering (the Victorian cable pioneer Sir John Pender endowed the chair in UCL in 1885). John also served as vice-provost of UCL (1994-99) and president of the Institution of Electrical Engineers (2000-01), and retired as emeritus professor in 2004. John was calm, logical, efficient in all ways, encouraging and respectful of well-reasoned opinions. The concept of procrastination was alien to him, and he was always supportive and generous with advice. Born in Newbury, Berkshire, he was the son of Vera (nee Rawlinson) and Harry (Henry) Midwinter. As Harry belonged to the fourth generation of Midwinters to run a corn merchant’s business, it was expected that John would follow this path. At St Bartholomew’s grammar school, John was a bookish child who hated team sports, and showed early aptitude for engineering, building model aircraft and cars in his spare time. Following school, John volunteered for national service with the RAF. There he became a radar instructor and broke with family tradition by going on to study physics at King’s College London, where he gained a first-class degree (1961). His first job was with the Royal Radar Establishment, Malvern, Worcestershire, carrying out research in nonlinear optics, which led him to work on the first ruby laser in the UK. He continued this research with the Perkin-Elmer corporation in the US, and in 1971 returned to the UK to take up his GPO post. John met Maureen Holt through ballroom dancing as a teenager, and they married in 1961. Together they enjoyed travelling, hiking, planting their meadow, sharing a love of classical music and looking after several generations of Labrador dogs. In retirement, John became a passionate advocate for mitigating climate change, lecturing widely for the University of the Third Age (U3A). Maureen survives him, along with their four children, Timothy, Philippa, Kim and Piers, and five grandchildren.

12/13/2021,"Anne Hidalgo, the French Socialist presidential candidate, has repeated her plea for her leftwing rivals to unite, saying the left risked collapsing amid the alarming rise of the far-right. “We’re at a critical moment for our democracy,” Hidalgo said before a rally in Perpignan. “The left is at risk of disappearing. Hate speech and xenophobia have saturated the airwaves for months.”  Taking the stage, she appealed to other candidates on the left not to split the vote: “Wake up, see the danger that is facing us.” French voters felt “despairing and anguished” that the left was being drowned out of the political debate, she said. Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, is polling at a historic low of between 3% and 5% for the first round of April’s presidential race. In a dramatic announcement on TV news last week, she said she supported a citizens’ vote in January to choose one candidate on the left who had the best chance of winning. The left has never fielded so many different presidential candidates at this stage of the race. They include the Greens’ Yannick Jadot; Jean-Luc Mélenchon of La France Insoumise, who has a more leftwing programme than the Socialist party; and the Communist party’s Fabien Roussel. All have so far refused Hidalgo’s plea. They insist they will run separate campaigns, despite opinion polls putting each of them at no more than 10% and unable to reach the second round of voting. Roussel said the problems of the left were far more deep-seated than just “a casting problem” of finding a joint candidate. “The problem of the left today is that it no longer speaks to the working class,” he said. There is panic among some Socialists. The combined leftwing candidates currently account for between 24 and 29% of April’s first round vote, compared with 43% 10 years ago. The left has made a strong showing in recent regional elections and there is a new generation of young leftwing and green mayors in major cities, but it is in difficulty on the national stage. The far right is becoming the country’s strongest force and has taken working-class voters from the left. Polls show it with at least 30% support with two major candidates. The traditional far right figure Marine Le Pen is running for a third time, but she has competition from the high-profile TV pundit Éric Zemmour, who has convictions for inciting racial hatred, and who has launched an outsider presidential bid, saying immigration and Islam will destroy France. Hidalgo warned of “merchants of hatred … suffocating France” with their “morbid fantasies” of intolerance. She said she would not let Muslims be scapegoated or sit back while racist policies were discussed. Emmanuel Macron is likely to declare his re-election bid next month. Polls currently show him making it to the final round of voting against either the right’s Valérie Pécresse, who has risen in the polls, or a candidate from the far right. Voters on the left took to the streets in Paris and across France this weekend to urge parties on the left to join the “primary of the people”, a citizens’ initiative for a vote in mid-January to choose one leftwing candidate with the best chance of winning. “It’s very demoralising that the left isn’t capable of making a decent showing in the presidential race, when growing numbers of people have taken part in climate marches as well as the Black Lives Matter movement, and when we want social justice and proper environmental protection,” said Emma, 25, a community manager for a health charity who lives in the suburbs south-west of Paris. At the Paris protest, many hoped a new figure would step into the ring: Christiane Taubira, a former justice minister and member of parliament who supporters would like to see become France’s first black female president. Taubira, who introduced same-sex marriage in 2013 when she served in the Socialist government of François Hollande, is also well-known for the 2001 law recognising slavery as a crime against humanity. She has been described by the professor of political science Rémi Lefebvre as “the moral conscience of the left”. A recent poll by L’Obs magazine found she was the preferred candidate of voters on the left, but she has not yet said whether she would consider running at this late stage and in difficult circumstances with the left splintered into different factions. The L’Obs poll found that 86% of leftwing sympathisers would like one candidate to stand for a united left. “The left is low in the polls and it is divided,” said Gérard Grunberg, a political scientist and director of the Telos website. “No force really wants to ally with another, there is no strategy ... What is fundamental is the disappearance of the centre left. For the first time since the foundation of the Socialist party more than a century ago, there is no force on the centre left.” Grunberg said the party’s current low score confirmed its poor showing in the last presidential election in 2017, in which Macron won over centre-left voters when Hollande failed to stand for re-election after his presidency was mired in rows and internal feuding over economic policy.",News/World news,Anne Hidalgo renews call for French left to choose one presidential candidate,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/12/anne-hidalgo-renews-call-for-french-left-to-choose-one-presidential-candidate
