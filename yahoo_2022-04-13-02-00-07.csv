4/13/2022,"Princess Mako Princess Mako Japan's former Princess Mako has a new title to add to her resumé. Mako Komuro, who married her college boyfriend and moved to New York City last fall, is now reportedly assisting curators at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Because the law in Japan requires a princess to ""leave the imperial family upon marriage to a commoner,"" Princess Mako gave up her royal titles to marry Komuro. She also turned down a $1.3 million payout from the Japanese government that is traditionally paid to royal women who lose their royal status when they marry. According to the Japan Times, Mako is serving as an unpaid volunteer at the Met. The 30-year old is working within the museum's Asian art collection and has specifically been involved in preparing an exhibition of paintings inspired by the life of a 13th-century monk who traveled throughout Japan as he introduced Buddhism.

Watch: Japan's Princess Mako weds commoner and loses royal status Japanese Princess Mako quietly married a commoner without traditional wedding celebrations Tuesday and said their marriage — delayed three years and opposed by some — ""was a necessary choice to live while cherishing our hearts.” While still performing royal duties, she then worked as a special researcher at Tokyo's University Museum. A former curator at the Met tells PEOPLE, ""She's qualified and probably handling pieces in the collection.

The eldest daughter of Crown Prince Akishino became engaged in 2013 to Komuro, who is now a paralegal at a law firm in New York. The couple first announced their plans to wed in September 2017, but the event was ultimately pushed off following a dispute over money between Komuro's mother and her former fiancé concerning his having financed Komuro's education. They tied the knot last October without the fanfare that usually accompanies a royal wedding. The Imperial Household Agency (IHA) explained that Mako and her now-husband did not want to have a big wedding ""because their marriage is not celebrated by many people.""

4/13/2022,"A woman who was duct-taped to her seat on an American Airlines flight to Charlotte in July has been fined $81,950 by the Federal Aviation Administration — the administration’s largest fine to date. The woman was flying from Dallas-Fort Worth to Charlotte on an overnight flight that landed in Charotte on July 7. According to the FAA, the woman threatened to hurt a flight attendant after falling into the aisle. The passenger then pushed the flight attendant aside and tried to open the cabin door. More info: CLT flight attendants describe anxiety amid 2021’s unruly passengers The FAA announced the latest round of fines for unruly passengers Friday. Two flight attendants tried to restrain the passenger, but the woman repeatedly hit one flight attendant on the head, according to the FAA. She also bit and tried to kick the crew, according to the FAA. A video posted to TikTok at the time, that has since been removed, showed the woman in visible distress, restrained to her seat as passengers left the plane at the Charlotte airport. The woman was transported to a hospital for evaluation after the flight landed safely at Charlotte Douglas International Airport, American Airlines said at the time. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police was also present at the landing, according to the airline. Reports of unruly passengers on planes jumped dramatically in 2021, often centering around alcohol consumption or mask complaints, according to the FAA. Last year, the FAA initiated a record-high 1,099 investigations into unruly passenger reports, compared to 183 in 2020 and 146 in 2019. So far this year, the FAA has initiated 309 investigations into unruly passenger reports. Unruly passengers have always been part of the job for flight attendants. But it’s gotten much worse, CLT-based flight attendants told the Observer last year. In fact, the Federal Air Marshal Service teaches a self-defense class for airplane crew members once a month at the agency’s Charlotte field office. “Our entire job is preparing for the worst-case scenario,”American Airlines flight attendant Courtney McDonald told the Observer in August 2021, as McDonald and other flight attendants learned self-defense strategies.",U.S./Charlotte Observer,"Unruly woman on American flight to Charlotte duct-taped to seat, hit with largest FAA fine",https://news.yahoo.com/unruly-woman-american-flight-charlotte-154941548.html

4/13/2022,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has put a new focus on mechanized land warfare. In a world where there’s no room for second place, most tanks are actually quite good. Some tanks, however, are either poorly designed, poorly built, or should have headed to the scrap heap a long time ago. The Russian invasion of Ukraine reintroduced Europe to something many thought had been relegated to the proverbial trash heap of history: large-scale, mechanized warfare. In late February, at Russian President Vladimir Putin’s command, more than 1,000 tanks marched on the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. The result has been six weeks of intense, grinding warfare, the scale of which has not been seen in Europe since World War II, with tanks fighting on both sides. The armies of the world operate a grand total of 73,000 tanks of all types. Tank warfare is highly competitive, and bad tanks are quickly destroyed in wartime. Many of the “worst” tanks are badly designed or built, their flaws hidden for decades before finally being revealed in actual combat. Others, unfairly or not, are simply good tanks that have soldiered on for too long. One of the most iconic tanks of the Second World War was the Soviet T-34 medium tank. The T-34, conceived in great secrecy in Stalinist Russia, featured a powerful 76.2-millimeter main gun, good armor protection, and good cross-country mobility. By 1945, the tank— armed with a heavier 85-millimeter gun and improved armor, now dubbed the T-34/85—was spearheading the Russian Army’s drive on Berlin. Nearly 80 years later, the North Korean People’s Army’s thrifty reserve forces still operate T-34/85 tanks. They’ve been overhauled and fitted with new running gear and slat armor designed to pre-detonate the warheads of anti-tank missiles. Despite these modest improvements, the lifetime of a T-34/85 in a match against South Korean K-2 tanks and American M1A2 tanks would be measured in seconds, depending on how long it took its adversaries to load their guns. India’s first indigenous tank, the Arjun, had one of the longest development periods of any armored vehicle in recent history. The Arjun main battle tank was projected to enter service in 1985. Instead, the tank—named after one of India’s legendary warriors—blew deadline after deadline and entered service in 2009, a remarkable 37 years after the decision was first made to build it. India’s defense establishment was not ready to build a modern main battle tank, and the Arjun was updated several times during the design process. The main gun was upgraded from a 105-millimeter to 120-millimeter gun, while the armor was increased to deal with advances in anti-tank weapons. Engineers also had to accommodate new technologies, including GPS navigation, laser warning receivers, and reactive armor. As a result of all these changes, Arjun’s weight ballooned from 40 tons to 62 tons, making what would have been a nimble tank one of the more sluggish tanks on the modern battlefield. The Arjun Mk.1 entered service with the Indian Army in 2009, but the service was reluctant to buy what had become known as a mechanically-unreliable tank. The army was forced to buy 124 Arjun Mk. 1s, with the promise that future Mk.1A Arjuns would correct the original tank’s glaring flaws. The Arjun Mk.1 will probably serve for 20 years or less, considerably less time than it actually took to develop the tank. In the late 1960s, the Soviet Union sought to develop a tank that would be superior to existing NATO tanks in every way. The tank, later known as the T-72, would mount the powerful 125-millimeter 2A46M main gun, incorporate superior armored protection, have a low profile, and prowl the battlefield at high speeds. Soviet factories and licensees churned out 17,700 T-72s, and the tank was a major threat to the armies of NATO. These tanks still serve today in the Russian Army as the T-72B and T-72B3 main battle tanks. Although a powerful tank on paper, the T-72 has serious problems. The main gun is mediocre by today’s standards, and the tank suffers from a lack of modern ammunition. The T-72’s low profile, while useful in avoiding detection, means the main gun cannot be elevated to engage enemies in multi-story buildings. Tanks such as the T-72B and -B3 have not received major armor upgrades, instead settling for the addition of blocks of reactive armor. Even today, most of the Russian Army’s T-72 tanks lack third-generation night vision sighting systems. Perhaps the biggest problem is that the tank stores its main gun ammunition among the crew. A penetration of the tank’s main armor will often detonate the ammo, killing the crew before they have the opportunity to escape. Not only does this destroy the tank, it also wipes out an entire trained tank crew. The T-72’s problems first came to light in the 1991 Gulf War, as Iraqi tanks demonstrated a tendency to violently explode in combat. The 2022 invasion of Ukraine has seen Russia lose 471 tanks in just six weeks, including 264 T-72s. Images of T-72s, their turrets blown off their hulls by ammunition explosions, are a common sight. A major problem is the use of anti-tank weapons with top attack capabilities, including the United Kingdom’s NLAW rocket and the American Javelin missile, which can circumvent the T-72’s main armor by firing a shaped charge into the top of a tank. The T-80 is another holdover from the Soviet Union and, like the T-72, is serving beyond its expiration date. The T-80 and the T-72 are similar in armament, protection, and appearance, but with one key difference under the hood: the T-80 uses a gasoline-powered turbine engine instead of a diesel engine like the rest of the Russian Army’s tanks. This makes the T-80 more responsive on the battlefield and better in cold temperatures than a diesel-powered tank. Despite these advantages, the T-80 has all the problems of the T-72 ... and then some. The T-80’s 1,250-horsepower GTD-1250 gas turbine engine is less reliable than the diesel engine that runs the T-72. It also uses more fuel and forces the Russian Army to keep two fuel supplies—gasoline and diesel—flowing to frontline units. This is a problematic combination for a Russian Army not known for attention to logistics and maintenance issues. The T-80’s problems may have contributed to the overall failure of the Russian Ground Forces to achieve its objectives. Of 57 T-80U tanks lost by the Russian Army in Ukraine, only 15 were destroyed. The other 42 tanks were abandoned or captured, suggesting that the vehicles ran out of fuel or encountered mechanical problems. Of 21 slightly improved T-80BVM tanks, only six were destroyed, and the remaining 15 were either abandoned or captured.  The Islamic Republic of Iran has developed several tanks over the past four decades. The most dubious of these tanks is the Tiam (“Eyes”) tank. The Tiam is developed from the 1950s-era American M47 Patton tank. The M47 was supplied in large numbers to the Shah of Iran, but waves of international arms embargoes slapped on the country from 1980 to present have prevented it from acquiring a modern tank force. As a result, Iran’s “new” tanks are typically derived from older tanks, especially those acquired before the fall of the Shah in 1979. Tiam uses the hull of the M47 Patton paired with 750-horsepower Continental AVDS-1790-2 V12 diesel engines drawn from other, equally old American tanks sold to the Shah. In other words, the engines are nearly 50 years old in many cases. The tank uses the turret of a Chinese Type-59 tank that is nearly as old, though Tiam turrets have been spotted with additional steel armor and explosive reactive armor. Despite the improvements, Tiam’s armor will be no match for the high-velocity anti-tank rounds of modern Western tanks, including the American M1 Abrams and German Leopard 2. Like a lot of Iran’s modern military equipment, Tiam is a rejiggering of half-century old technology and equipment in an attempt to make something useful for the modern battlefield. While Iran might get an “A” for effort, the Tiam combines the worst aspects of all previous tanks on this list, including age, vulnerability, and reliability. Tiam is a tank born into second place, and as the conflict in Ukraine shows, there is no prize for second place in warfare.

4/13/2022,"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — A state court judge has ruled that Democrat Abby Finkenauer cannot appear on the June 7 Iowa primary ballot for U.S. Senate because she didn't gather enough petition signatures, potentially knocking off the candidate considered by many to be the party’s best chance to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Charles Grassley. Judge Scott Beattie, a 2018 appointee of Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, filed a ruling late Sunday that overturned a decision by a three-member panel of state elected officials. The panel concluded last week that Finkenauer's campaign staffers had substantially complied with Iowa law that requires candidates to obtain 3,500 names, including at least 100 signatures from at least 19 counties. Finkenauer plans to appeal the decision and the Iowa Supreme Court scheduled a hearing Wednesday with a promise to rule on the matter by the end of the week to meet deadlines for sending ballots to overseas voters. Two Republicans challenged Finkenauer's petition papers, saying signatures from at least two counties did not have the required date accompanying them. In the past, the panel, which includes the secretary of state, attorney general and state auditor, has found petitions to be in substantial compliance with the law even though signatures were missing or difficult to interpret. Attorney General Tom Miller and Auditor Rob Sand, both Democrats, voted to allow Finkenauer's petitions citing past precedent for giving deference to campaigns that used the proper forms and made efforts to comply with the law. Secretary of State Paul Pate, a Republican, voted against Finkenauer's petition. Kim Schmett and Leanne Pellett, former Republican county elections officials, challenged the signatures and then filed a court appeal of the Iowa Objection Panel's decision last week. Beattie concluded that the panel's legal interpretation was wrong and that the law clearly says each signature should be accompanied by a date. His decision knocked signatures from Allamakee and Cedar counties off of Finkenauer's nomination petitions, which meant her campaign failed to submit at least 100 signatures from at least 19 counties as required. Beattie said he took no joy in the decision. “This court should not be in the position to make a difference in an election, and Ms. Finkenauer and her supporters should have a chance to advance her candidacy. However, this court’s job is to sit as a referee and apply the law without passion or prejudice. It is required to rule without consideration of the politics of the day. Here the court has attempted to fulfill that role,” he said, Finkenauer accused Beattie of doing the bidding of Grassley and his allies in Washington. “This misguided, midnight ruling is an outrageous and partisan gift to the Washington Republicans who orchestrated this meritless legal action,"" she said. “We are exploring all of our options to fight back hard against this meritless partisan attack, and to ensure that the voices of Iowans will be heard at the ballot box."" Finkenauer said her petitions had more than 5,000 signatures and she’s confident she has met the requirements to be on the ballot. Beattie promised last week he would file a decision by midnight Sunday to give either side time to appeal to the Iowa Supreme Court. He filed the decision at 10:49 p.m. Sunday. Pate has said he must know whether Finkenauer qualifies for the ballot by Friday to give him time to have ballots printed and sent to overseas voters who must get their ballots by April 23 to comply with the law. Finkenauer, who served one term in the U.S. House from 2019-2021, seeks to be on the ballot with Democrats Mike Franken, a retired Navy admiral, and Glenn Hurst, a doctor and Minden City Council member. The primary winner will face Grassley, who is seeking an eighth term in the Senate. Federal fundraising data and statewide polling indicate that Grassley, who turns 89 in September, is well positioned to retain the seat he has held since 1981 for another six years. Grassley has raised more than $4.7 million, Finkenauer about $1.9 million and Franken $1.8 million. Hurst raised just over $66,000. Republican state Sen. Jim Carlin, who will be on the Republican primary ballot opposite Grassley, raised $282,151. The Des Moines Register/Medicom Poll published in November gave Grassley a lead of 18 percentage points over Finkenauer. Alan R. Ostergren, the attorney for Schmett and Pellett, said the judge's decision is a victory for the rule of law. “Iowans expect candidates to follow state law and to follow the same rules as the hundreds of other candidates who successfully qualified to be on the ballot,"" he said in a statement. ""Anyone who has ever been involved in a political campaign knows that you can easily avoid problems by turning in more than the bare minimum number of signatures.

4/13/2022,"Charles Kupperman served as former President Donald Trump's deputy national security adviser. At a 2019 meeting, he said, Trump grew irate when the subject turned to Ukraine. ""He just let loose,"" Kupperman told The New York Times. Former President Donald Trump threw a fit and launched into a profanity-laced rant at a 2019 meeting when the topic of Ukraine came up, according to a former aide, falsely accusing the country of trying to defeat him in the 2016 US election. Speaking to The New York Times Magazine, Charles Kupperman, then serving as deputy national security adviser, accused his former boss of being incapable of understanding global politics and the importance of Ukraine. For him, Kupperman said, it was all personal. That became clear in a May 23, 2019, meeting. According to Kupperman, who left the Trump administration five months later, Trump ""just let loose"" when the topic of Ukraine came up. ""They're [expletive] corrupt. They [expletive] tried to screw me,'"" Trump said, Kupperman told The Times. Later that year, Trump was impeached by the House after withholding some $400 million in security aide for Ukraine that had been approved by Congress, telling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksyy in a September phone call that he first wanted a ""favor"": that he publicly announce an investigation into his rival's son, Hunter Biden. He also asked for an investigation into the unsubstantiated claim it was Ukraine — not Russia — that interfered in the 2016 presidential campaign. ""I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike... The server, they say Ukraine has it,"" Trump told Zelenskyy, referencing a false claim — pushed by his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and Russian intelligence — that Kyiv had sought to aid the presidential campaign of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. In his interview with the Times, Kupperman said it was clear this — and manufacturing dirt on the Biden family — was the extent of his interest in Ukraine. ""If one were to ask him to define 'balance of power,' he wouldn't know what that concept was,"" Kupperman said. ""He'd have no idea about the history of Ukraine and why it's in the front pages today. He wouldn't know that Stalin starved that country. Those are the contextual points one has to take into account in the making of foreign policy. But he wasn't capable of it, because he had no understanding of history: how these countries and their leadership evolved, what makes these countries tick.""

4/13/2022,"* Peace talks hit a dead end - Putin * West's economic Blitzkrieg has failed - Putin * Putin: Bucha is fake like staged Syrian chemical attack * Russia to achieve 'noble' war aims - Putin (Recasts headline and lead) By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON, April 12 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday peace talks with Ukraine had hit a dead end, using his first public comments on the conflict in more than a week to vow that his troops would win and to goad the West for failing to bring Moscow to heel. Addressing the war in public for the first time since Russian forces retreated from northern Ukraine after they were halted at the gates of Kyiv, Putin promised that Russia would achieve all of its ""noble"" aims in Ukraine. In the strongest signal to date that the war will grind on for longer, Putin said Kyiv had derailed peace talks by staging what he said were fake claims of Russian war crimes and by demanding security guarantees to cover the whole of Ukraine. ""We have again returned to a dead-end situation for us,"" Putin, Russia's paramount leader since 1999, told a news briefing during a visit to the Vostochny Cosmodrome 3,450 miles (5,550 km) east of Moscow. Asked by Russian space agency workers if the operation in Ukraine would achieve its goals, Putin said: ""Absolutely. I don't have any doubt at all."" Russia, he said, would ""rhythmically and calmly"" continue its operation. Putin said Russia had no choice but to fight because it had to defend the Russian speakers of eastern Ukraine and prevent its former Soviet neighbour from becoming an anti-Russian springboard for Moscow's enemies. The West has condemned the war as a brutal imperial-style land grab targeting a sovereign country. Ukraine says it is fighting for its survival after Putin annexed Crimea in 2014 and on Feb. 21 recognised two of its rebel regions as sovereign. Putin dismissed the West's sanctions, which have tipped Russia towards its worst economic contraction since the years following the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, as a failure. ""That Blitzkrieg on which our foes were counting did not work,"" Putin said. Putin, who had been ubiquitous on Russian television in the early days of the war, had largely retreated from public view since Russia's withdrawal from northern Ukraine two weeks ago. His only public appearance in the past week was at the funeral of a nationalist lawmaker, where he did not directly address the war. On Monday he met the visiting chancellor of Austria at a country residence outside Moscow but no images of that meeting were released. 'BUCHA IS FAKE' Putin dismissed Ukrainian and Western claims that Russia had committed war crimes as fakes. Since Russian troops withdrew from towns and villages around the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, Ukrainian troops have been showing journalists corpses of what they say are civilians killed by Russian forces, destroyed houses and burnt-out cars. Reuters saw dead bodies in the town of Bucha but could not independently verify who was responsible for the killings. Ukraine says Russia is guilty of genocide and U.S. President Joe Biden has accused Putin of war crimes and called for a trial. Putin said he had told Western leaders to think a little about destruction by the United States of the Syrian city of Raqqa, the former de facto capital of the Islamic State caliphate, and in Afghanistan. ""Have you seen how this Syrian city was turned to rubble by American aircraft? Corpses lay in the ruins for months decomposing,"" Putin said. ""Nobody cared. No one even noticed."" ""There was no such silence when provocations were staged in Syria, when they portrayed the use of chemical weapons by the Assad government. Then it turned out that it was fake. It's the same kind of fake in Bucha."" Putin, who says Ukraine and Russia are essentially one people, casts the war as an inevitable confrontation with the United States, which he accuses of threatening Russia by meddling in its backyard. Sixty one years to the day since the Soviet Union's Yuri Gagarin blasted off into the history books by becoming the first man in space, Putin drew an analogy between Soviet space successes and Russia's defiance today. ""The sanctions were total, the isolation was complete but the Soviet Union was still first in space,"" said Putin, 69, recalling his own wonderment as a schoolboy learning of the achievement. ""We don't intend to be isolated,"" Putin added. ""It is impossible to severely isolate anyone in the modern world - especially such a vast country as Russia.""
