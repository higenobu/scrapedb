3/22/2022,"A video of defence secretary Ben Wallace being duped into speaking by phone to an impostor posing as the Ukrainian prime minister was published on Monday – hours after Downing Street said it believed Russian state actors were responsible for the hoax. In the short clip, Wallace replies with scepticism and apparent confusion when the caller asks him questions. Earlier, the UK government warned that the impostors were linked to the Kremlin and could release a doctored video of the call with the defence secretary. Wallace tweeted: “Things must be going so badly for the Kremlin that they are now resorting to pranks and video fakes. Not the actions of a confident Government, but then again after the Salisbury Cathedral sightseeing story, anything is possible …” The prankster pair, Vovan and Lexus, claimed responsibility for the video. They are suspected of links to Russia’s security services, which they have. denied. The episode raises serious questions about the security and defence failings that led to pranksters getting through to one of the UK’s most senior ministers and managing to get him to talk about a highly sensitive military and diplomatic situation in Ukraine. In the clip, Wallace appears to be asked if he will support Ukraine’s nuclear aims – Russia has falsely claimed Kyiv has nuclear ambitions. A defence source said Wallace had made it clear in a missing part of the conversation that the UK would never support Ukraine getting nuclear weapons and highlighted this would not be allowed under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Government sources said the video was doctored but did not dispute the substance of what Wallace appeared to have said. Vovan and Lexus are professional prank callers, whose real names are Alexei Stolyarov and Vladimir Kuznetsov. They have previously got through to Elton John and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. The caller who reached Wallace was pretending to be Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal. Priti Patel, the home secretary, was also targeted, as well as Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary. In its first statement attributing blame for the video calls, No 10 said on Monday it believed Russian state actors were responsible. The prime minister’s official spokesperson said: “The Russian state was responsible for the hoax telephone calls made to UK ministers last week. “This is standard practice for Russian information operations and disinformation is a tactic straight from the Kremlin playbook to try to distract from their illegal activities in Ukraine and the human rights abuses being committed there. “We are seeing a string of distraction stories and outright lies from the Kremlin, reflecting [Vladimir] Putin’s desperation as he seeks to hide the scale of the conflict and Russia’s failings on the battlefield.” Wallace publicly acknowledged he had been targeted shortly after his call on Thursday. An investigation has been launched into how it happened and a cross-Whitehall review is looking at tightening up security procedures. There have been many similar hoax calls in the past but not attributed to the Russian state. In May 2018, Boris Johnson – then the foreign secretary – talked about international relations and rude poetry with a hoax caller who pretended to be the Armenian prime minister. In 2015, it emerged that an impostor claiming to be the head of GCHQ, Robert Hannigan, managed to get through to the then prime minister, David Cameron, on his mobile number. In another hoax, a caller rang GCHQ and managed to obtain Hannigan’s mobile phone number.",News/World news,Video released showing Russian hoax call with UK defence secretary,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/21/video-released-showing-russian-hoax-call-with-uk-defence-secretary
3/22/2022,"The Raine Group, the US Bank handling the sale of Chelsea, could be in a position to take their preferred bidder to the government for approval by the end of this week if the process moves smoothly over the next 48 hours. Potential buyers spent Monday waiting anxiously to find out if they had made it to the next stage of the process. Raine have been assessing the merits of each bidder since the deadline to make offers for Chelsea passed last Friday and the expectation is that the bank will have reduced the field to a shortlist of three groups by Wednesday morning at the latest. Chelsea are in an uncertain position following the sanctioning of Roman Abramovich and any sale will require the green light from the government, who will need to issue the club with a new operating licence before any deal goes through. It is understood that the government is chiefly concerned with ensuring that no money will go to Abramovich, while there is understood to be support for a consortium led by Sir Martin Broughton and Lord Coe in Westminster circles. A host of suitors have lined up to buy Chelsea since Abramovich put the European champions up for sale. A consortium fronted by Todd Boehly, Jonathan Goldstein and Hansjörg Wyss has built solid momentum. The owners of the Chicago Cubs, the Ricketts family, are said to be confident with their bid after partnering with the billionaire hedge fund tycoon Ken Griffin. Broughton and Coe, meanwhile, have stayed quiet on the source of their investment. It has not been confirmed whether they are being backed by the Crystal Palace shareholders Josh Harris and David Blitzer, but there could be complications if Harris and Blitzer are involved, as the pair would have to divest their stakes in Palace, which would lead to delays with getting the Chelsea deal past the Premier League. All that is clear at the moment is that there is plenty of interest in Chelsea. On Monday the British property tycoon Nick Candy, who has partnered with Hana Financial Group and C&P Sports Group, revealed that he has increased his initial bid of £2bn after receiving further backing from a South Korean company. Catalina Kim, the CEO of C&P Sports Group, is understood to be looking for further investors to strengthen the Candy bid. Brian Gordon, a parter at Squire Patton Boggs, a law firm working with Candy’s Blue Football consortium, said: “The Blue Football Consortium has access to immediate capital with funds readily available from day one. The bid is sourced from credible co-venturers.” The identity of bidders continued to emerge yesterday, with some still unknown to the public. Centricus, a global investment firm based in London, were reported to have bid £3bn. Suggestions that they have received backing from the Middle East have been denied. Other bidders include Woody Johnson, owner of the New York Jets, and the Saudi Media Group. Sky News reported that there was also a bid from the chairman of the National Basketball Association in the US, Larry Tanenbaum.",Sport/Football,Identity of post-Abramovich Chelsea buyer could emerge by end of week,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/21/abramovich-chelsea-buyer-sale
3/22/2022,"When Nicole Greem decided to return to her job as a nurse after maternity leave, her biggest stumbling block wasn’t whether she could find work, but whether she could access childcare. Like many places in regional New South Wales, Bourke, where Greem and her family live, had been crying out for healthcare workers. But even those who lived there were struggling to take up the shifts they wanted. “I’ve cut back work to two days a week because I can’t get childcare for the extra hours,” Greem told Guardian Australia. “And I had to go on a workplace agreement that is really hard to get, that has set hours. They only agreed to that for a three-month period and they might be able to say at the end of that that it doesn’t suit them. If that happens, I might have to quit.” Greem is one of approximately 9 million Australians living in a childcare “desert”, where available places outnumber children under five by 3:1 or more, according to a new report. The research, conducted by the Mitchell Institute at Victoria University, found that 35.2% of the Australian population lives in one of these “deserts”, with a distinct correlation between wealth and childcare availability and cost. The report comes as research shows that lack of access to childcare costs women earning the median wage about $118,000 in superannuation over their lifetime. “Where you live matters when it comes to childcare,” said Peter Hurley, the lead author of the report, Deserts and Oases: How accessible is childcare in Australia? “We know how important socioeconomic factors are in influencing education outcomes. When it comes to childcare, though, none of that knowledge is applied.” While in the major cities there were few places without any childcare whatsoever, accessibility became patchier further out, the report showed. The researchers found about 28.8% of people living in the major cities were in a childcare desert, while the cost rose in wealthier areas. Outside the major cities, centres became more scarce, with 44.6% of those living in regional areas and 85.3% of people in remote Australia living in childcare deserts. In some places, the number of children under four vastly exceeded availability. In the Loddon Elmore region of Victoria, for example, there were 34 children under four for every childcare place. In NSW, things were worst in the Broken Hill region, where nearly eight children were vying for each childcare place. The most deprived regions of Queensland were the Far North and Central Highlands (8.66 and 7.09 children per place respectively). In Bourke, where Greem lives, there were 4.41 children under four for every childcare place. South Canberra was the only region in which there were slightly more places than children, at 0.86 children per place. Women’s participation in the workforce was lower in areas where people had less access to childcare, the report said. It wasn’t clear from the available data whether the key factor was a lack of childcare options, or whether women were choosing to stay at home with their young children thus creating a lack of demand, the report said. It urged further research to better understand how childcare access was influencing women’s participation in the workforce. Other research from Industry Super Australia, released on Monday, showed women would be better off in retirement if subsidies were increased to make childcare more affordable. ISA said the move would help close the superannuation gap between men and women, the latter of whom retire with an average of a third less super than men, because of time spent out of the workforce with children. Greem believed the lack of access was hurting the women she knew. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “I definitely think it affects women a lot more. I had a colleague say to me yesterday that she might have to give up work. “At the moment she has her kids in daycare five days a week but if she can’t extend her work agreement, then she’s going to have to give up work. And that’s another nurse that we’ll lose.” The difficulty was not just the childcare places themselves, Greem said, but a centre’s opening hours, which tended to be based around the 9am-5pm worker. “A lot of the police here in town do 12-hour shifts starting from 6am,” said Greem. “A lot of nurses start at 7am and the childcare centre is only open from 7.30am and closes at 6pm. They need longer opening hours and need more funding to take on more children and put more staff on.” Hurley said part of the problem was that the early learning sector currently operated on a “risk and reward” basis. “The same underlying principles are used in childcare as with airlines. If they can’t be confident there will be enough demand to meet the investment then they’re not going to fly there,” said Hurley. “That’s fine if you’re in places where there are lots of services, but if you’re living in an area where it doesn’t make some form of business sense for a provider to operate out of, then bad luck. It’s very different from schools where they have a central coordinating authority.”",News/Australia news,"Over a third of all Australians live in childcare ‘deserts’, research says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/22/over-a-third-of-all-australians-live-in-childcare-deserts-research-says
3/22/2022,"Fertiliser prices have broken new records as global supplies are hit by multiple factors including reduced supplies from Russia and Belarus, disruptions to the supply chain, a China export ban and a Canadian rail strike. “It’s a series of events we’ve never seen before and it continues to look like it’s going to get worse than better,” said Josh Linville, the director of fertiliser at the US commodity trader StoneX. “People thought the Russia-Ukraine war would be quick and Russia would be back out in the market and that’s not been the case.” Prices for raw materials that make up the crop nutrient commodity market – ammonia, nitrogen, potash, urea, phosphates, sulphates and nitrates – have risen 30% since the start of the year, and are now higher than the levels reached during the food and energy crisis when prices jumped in 2008, according to CRU, a UK-based commodity consultancy. Prices of Nola urea, one of the easiest fertiliser commodities to track, is trading at a 34-year high of $880 a US ton – in 2020 the price was $182. Prices are up 60% since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. Linville said he was now witnessing grain prices moving in response to fertiliser prices, not vice versa. “It’s something we’ve never seen before,” he said. “It’s new territory for everybody who has ever been in this market.” Grain prices have been volatile since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as importers are heavily reliant on supplies shipped from the Black Sea region. Russian fertiliser companies have not been hit with sanctions, through a number of Russian executives connected to the industry have been placed on sanctions lists. The country’s industry and trade ministry on 4 March recommended that its producers temporarily halt fertiliser exports. The ban was largely symbolic, however, since most of the country’s fertiliser exports move through ports disrupted by the conflict in Ukraine. Belarus, which exports potash through Lithuanian ports, was hit with export sanctions after it permitted Russian troops to stage and enter Ukraine across its borders. Russia and Belarus are the world’s second- and third-largest producers of potash, a key ingredient for producing nitrogen-containing fertilisers, after Canada. “There’s a sheer logistical problem of how to get it out of Baltic and the Black Sea ports, it’s difficult to find buyers because people don’t want to engage with Russian companies,” sai Mike Nash at the commodity market analyst Argus. “The logical conclusion to this is demand destruction,” he adds. “I don’t see any change while this conflict continues.” Last year, China tightened its controls on exports of fertilisers, primarily nitrogen and phosphate, effectively shutting off the supply to the global market through to June this year to try to limit a rise in domestic food prices. Beijing’s move exacerbated a shortage of global supplies and helped contribute to a surge in prices across international markets. According to Nash, the likelihood of China lifting restrictions in June is remote. While the loss of Chinese, Russian and Belarusian exports have pushed fertiliser prices up further, a labour dispute at Canadian Pacific Railways is expected to aggravate shortages. Canada’s Nutrien Ltd, the world’s biggest fertiliser producer, said it could weather a freight shutdown lasting a few days but a longer shutdown would force it to consider slowing potash production. The company said last week it planned to increase potash output by nearly 1m tonnes this year to about 15m tonnes in response to the uncertainty of supply from eastern Europe.",News/Global development,Fertiliser prices hit new highs as multiple problems affect global supplies,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/21/fertiliser-prices-hit-new-highs-as-multiple-problems-affect-global-supplies
3/22/2022,"Good morning. Defence minister Peter Dutton is due to make two speeches to promote a tough message on national security: one announcing Australia may establish a US-style space force in the future and accusing some countries – including Russia – of seeing “space as a territory for their taking”. The second will acknowledge Australia is “in the crosshairs” for cyber-attacks and that China has the capability to mount “an unprecedented digital onslaught”. Ukraine has rejected out of hand an ultimatum from Moscow to surrender the devastated city of Mariupol, as authorities in Odesa accused Russia of striking residential areas in what would be the invading forces’ first attack on the Black Sea port. Ukraine also turned down Moscow’s offer to open two humanitarian corridors out of Mariupol in exchange for its residents’ capitulation. Officials have said at least 2,300 residents have died, with some buried in mass graves. Overnight shelling in the capital, Kyiv, reduced a large shopping mall to rubble and killed at least eight people. A Russian attack on Kharkiv has killed a 96-year-old man who survived a string of Nazi concentration camps. More than $17bn (£13bn) of global assets have been linked to 35 oligarchs and Russian officials alleged to have close ties to Vladimir Putin in an ongoing project to track the wealth of Russia’s most powerful operators. A passenger plane carrying 132 people has crashed in southern China, with no survivors announced so far. The China Eastern Airlines plane, a Boeing 737, plummeted more than 20,000 feet in just over a minute. It then seems to have regained altitude momentarily, before dropping rapidly again. The airline said no foreign nationals were aboard the plane. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, called for a prompt investigation into the cause the country’s first major fatal air disaster since 2010. The pace at which the Australian government is approving the destruction of habitat relied on by threatened species has increased in recent years, despite scientists warning of an escalating extinction crisis, according to the Australian Conservation Foundation. It found nearly three-quarters of the clearing approved was for new and expanded mining developments. Koalas were the most affected species, with more than 25,000 hectares of habitat approved for clearing. Meanwhile, one of the Great Barrier Reef’s healthiest reefs has succumbed to coral bleaching. The first recorded widespread bleaching event during the cooler temperatures of La Niña has left scientists dreading the damage that could be caused by the next El Niño. Voters are underwhelmed by the Morrison government’s response to flooding in New South Wales and Queensland, and a majority fear disasters will be worse without significant action to address climate risks, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. Kimberley Kitching’s husband has, during her funeral service, criticised a “cantankerous cabal” over its treatment of the late Victorian senator.

We were booked to headline, and then we asked to open, and the booking agent was like, ‘Oh … OK.’ It was all a bit of an anticlimax.

3/22/2022,"After England landed on Monday in idyllic Grenada, their seamers could have been forgiven for heading straight to the National Stadium and subtly sprinkling grass seed on the pitch in the way that Andy Dufresne shook dirt out of his trouser leg in the yard of Shawshank prison. The two docile surfaces on show during the draws in Antigua and Barbados have certainly been restorative for Joe Root’s batters after their collective meltdown in Australia; out of the top six, only Alex Lees averages under 40 during a series in which they have twice thrown the bat in the second innings, with five centuries so far compared with an Ashes series that featured one. Along with Dan Lawrence’s zesty scores of 91 and 41 in Bridgetown, most encouraging was the 120 from Ben Stokes that pointed to a return to form after his absence last year; not just by weight of runs but the manner in which he ransacked the bowlers. “He’s somewhere near his best again,” Root said. “You can see he’s got that glint in his eye again and long may it continue.” For the fast-medium bowlers it has been exhausting work in the main, however, summed up on day five when Saqib Mahmood’s removal of Shamarh Brooks was courtesy of the first catch in the slip cordon all match. None of them has been taken apart – losing two tosses has led to the West Indies opt to grinding out their runs – but they have claimed a wicket every 105 balls on average. It may be that we have already witnessed the last overseas Test for Chris Woakes after two wickets all series. His away average was well documented – 52 before this tour, 54 now – and so to expect a 33-year-old to haul himself off the Ashes canvas for a third assignment of the winter, replacing Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad in the process, was always a huge ask. The time to hand Woakes greater responsibility was probably two years ago when his pace was up and performances in Hamilton and Johannesburg during the winter of 2019-20 hinted at a corner being turned. He remains the ultimate professional and a banker on home soil but confidence – both his and that of his captain – has waned as the series has rolled on. Paul Collingwood, the interim head coach, was asked about Woakes and opted to broaden this out to an attack that has put its “heart and soul” into the task. If there is more encouragement from conditions in the deciding third Test that starts on Thursday, he said, Woakes may be yet re-energised. That said, Ollie Robinson is now finally ready and available after the back spasms that began in Antigua, as is Craig Overton after a spot of illness and fatigue. Mahmood’s four-wicket debut and waspish point of difference demands retention; by contrast Matthew Fisher’s first outing was wholehearted but less conclusive. Also in the mix is Matt Parkinson, who has been a perennial squad man over the past two years but has yet to win a cap. Jack Leach has sent down 1,011 deliveries for his 11 wickets – operating parsimoniously in the main – but if another batter-friendly surface prevails then Root will need a more attacking foil to go with him. “He is ready as can be,” Collingwood said, when asked if Parkinson’s wait may be coming to an end. “The simple fact is in Covid times you don’t get matches in between Tests. They are back-to-back to back and it is putting a lot of stress on the players and preparation time for guys who are not in the team.” For the second week running, Collingwood hailed the work ethic of his players. This has been driven in part by Stokes, the vice-captain, who off the field is training with the intensity of his best years, 2018 to 2020 – while the camera crew for the forthcoming documentary about his past 18 months look on. “I wouldn’t have thought so,” Collingwood replied, when asked if the cameras are having an impact here. “But I’m sure it’ll be good viewing. He’s [just] desperate to do well for the badge, for England. “Even the meetings when we first arrived, getting the scar tissue from Australia out the way and how we were going to move forward, you could see and hear he had the bit between his teeth and wants to lead this team. I think he and Rooty have done a magnificent job turning this round. We can all see from the performances that there is a different energy about the team. That is the benchmark now; if we can do that, we will get the results.” This week represents the final chance for England to do so this winter and show these are more than just words, while all eyes are now on whether Grenada, the Spice Island, has a bit more pepper in its pitch.",Sport/Sport,England hoping for spicier pitch in Grenada for final West Indies Test,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/21/england-west-indies-preview-third-test-grenada
3/22/2022,"With a vote of no-confidence looming over his government, Pakistan’s prime minister, Imran Khan, warned those planning to vote against him that they risk social disgrace, and that “no one will marry your children”. The no-confidence vote is expected to be tabled on Friday 25 March, backed by a coalition of politicians who accuse Khan of bad governance and economic incompetence. In January inflation reached 13% and the cost of fuel and food rocketed. The opposition party claims that it has the support of more than 20 lawmakers of Khan’s Tehreek-i-Insaf party (PTI) and its allies. Khan also appeared to have lost the backing of the military establishment credited with bringing him to power. The votes would be enough to oust him. Talking to a public rally on Sunday in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Khan told party members who planned to vote against him: “Your children and families would lose respect and honour in society. No one will marry your children. People will neither trust you nor respect you. Masses are aware of the situation and what is happening in the country. This is the age of social media. It’s difficult to hide anything from them.” Khan asked them to change their minds. “I would forgive you like a father, or face disrespect in the society,” he warned in his speech. The information minister, Fawad Chaudhry, said more than a million people would gather in front of the parliament on the day of the vote in order to prevent it going ahead. Disruption followed, and a crowd of Khan’s supporters gathered outside Sindh House, in Islamabad, where some of the politicians who support the no-confidence were, and the gate was broken. On Monday Karachi police charged two PTI politicians and others with rioting and forcibly entering the residence of politician Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani in the city’s Bath Island area. Khan and his ministers have accused the opposition parties of horse trading and bribing their politicians. The allegations have been denied by the opposition and disgruntled lawmakers. A PTI politician, Noor Alam Khan, told local media he was “very disappointed to hear the fake allegations against the lawmakers”. Human Rights Watch said it feared violence before the no-confidence vote. The group urged the government and opposition to “deter supporters from violence” amid the threat of political turmoil. On Monday, during a hearing on the issue, the supreme court of Pakistan said members of the national assembly should be allowed to vote for whoever they wanted. The court also directed the government and the opposition to avoid gathering a crowd outside the parliament. The attorney general, representing the government, said he had talked to the prime minister and “there will be no crowd outside the assembly during the session. No [lawmaker] will be stopped by crowds”.",News/World news,"‘No one will marry your children,’ Pakistan PM warns ahead of vote",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/21/no-one-will-marry-your-children-pakistan-pm-warns-ahead-of-vote
3/22/2022,"Liverpool and Manchester City fans have united in their condemnation of the “shambolic” travel arrangements for their FA Cup semi-final at Wembley next month. Leading supporters groups from both clubs said they were “appalled” as the Football Association began liaising with Network Rail after it emerged no direct trains to London from Manchester and Merseyside are scheduled over the Easter weekend. Engineering work dictates that trains from Liverpool Lime Street will terminate at Rugby and those from Manchester Piccadilly at Milton Keynes, forcing fans to either travel by road, air or contemplate circuitous cross-country rail journeys that make day-return trips virtually impossible. Avanti West Coast on Monday confirmed the lack of direct trains. With television companies still finalising their plans for broadcasting the two semi-finals – Chelsea meet Crystal Palace in the other Wembley tie – on 16 and 17 April, the FA were exploring ways of minimising the potential disruption and travel costs . “The FA will be liaising closely with both Liverpool and Manchester City on all match arrangements, including supporters travel for the upcoming FA Cup semi-final fixture at Wembley Stadium, with further details to be announced in due course,” said a spokesmanon Monday night. “We are also continuing to work with both Network Rail and National Express to find a solution so that supporters of both teams are able to travel to and from the fixture with as minimal disruption as possible.” The leading Liverpool supporters group Spirit of Shankly is working with its counterparts at City’s We are 1894 to push the FA and television companies into finding some sort of compromise. “Fans representatives from both Liverpool and Man City are appalled at the shambolic travel arrangements,” tweeted Spirit of Shankly on Monday. Any solution would be welcomed by Jürgen Klopp. “How is it possible that the whole of the north-west is cut off from the rest of England?” asked the Liverpool manager after their quarter-final win against Nottingham Forest. “I do not know which kind of solutions are available but I hope someone finds one. If we could play with supporters that would be really good for both teams.” Chelsea can expect to have full support at their semi-final despite the UK government’s sanctions on Roman Abramovich barring the club from selling any new tickets. It is a situation intended to prevent Abramovich from benefiting from revenue streams but one Julian Knight, the chair of parliament’s digital, culture, media and sport select committee, disagrees with. Knight believes Chelsea fans should be allowed to purchase Wembley seats, with the proviso that all proceeds go to the people of Ukraine. “It is ridiculous that we face the prospect of a half-full Wembley for the Chelsea vs Palace FA Cup semi-final,” he said. “Chelsea is more than just its owner, it’s a living organism with huge importance to its fans and community. “It was understandable that, at short notice, last week’s game against Middlesbrough went ahead without Chelsea fans but, with this much notice, the FA have no excuse for excluding them. The FA must be allowed to sell tickets to Chelsea fans so long as all money goes to the people of Ukraine.” Discussions between the government, the Premier League and the Football Association on ticketing for Chelsea fixtures are ongoing, with one suggestion being that seats could be sold by an independent commercial ticket agency.",Sport/Football,Manchester City and Liverpool fans condemn lack of trains for semi-final,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/21/manchester-city-liverpool-fans-trains-fa-cup-semi-final
