5/6/2022,"A sobering set of wrought iron ankle shackles used to restrain people below deck as they were transported from Africa to enslavement have gone on permanent display in a room of beautiful sculptures at the Walker art gallery in Liverpool. The shackles have been placed near to sculpted portraits of the Sandbach family made in the 19th century by John Gibson, Liverpool’s leading sculptor. The family members were part of the Sandbach, Tinne and Co dynasty that made an immense fortune trading in enslaved people and their output, including sugar, rum, molasses, timber and coffee. The display of shackles in the same room as art comes after a community-led project to explore, confront and expose the links between slavery and art. Led by a steering group of marginalised young people in Liverpool, the project set out to “address the erasure of colonial history in the Walker’s sculpture display”. Alex Patterson, an assistant curator of fine art at National Museums Liverpool, said the project told an uncomfortable truth about the artworks – who commissioned them, and where the money came from to pay for them. “In the past, these histories have been overlooked, ignored or purposely omitted from public view,” she said. “This has meant we have only been telling one side of the story.” Patterson said she had learned much from the group “and I’m extremely grateful to have been part of their conversations, which were sometimes very personal and challenging for them. Individually and together, I admire their drive, their ability to think outside the box and to challenge the institutions and the hierarchies that exist inside them.” The shackles come from the collection of Liverpool’s International Slavery Museum. They are the type used during the so-called “middle passage” of the Atlantic slave trade to restrain African people below decks in a ship’s hold. The Walker said the decision to display them next to sculptures “was made to show that slavery does not only exist in history, and inside the walls of the International Slavery Museum, but that its legacies are still present in our streets, in our buildings and in our culture today.” Members of the Sandbach family included merchants, politicians, clergy and philanthropists and were key players in the development of Liverpool. They became dizzyingly wealthy largely because of the slave trade. The family were awarded substantial claims in compensation after the abolition of slavery in 1833. The project’s steering group worked with artists and historians including Malik Al Nasir, a poet whose PhD studies explore his ancestral links to, remarkably, both the Sandbach Tinne corporation and Africans enslaved by it. The steering group said it hoped its work would be a catalyst to bring about wider change and that other institutions would recontextualise artworks with colonial links. Gavin Odhiambo Okello-Davies, a steering group member, said: “It’s a revolutionary project that deserves the world’s attention. We’ve paved a path for so many future generations of PGM (people of global majority). We’ve got so much to explore as a national and international community.”",News/UK news,Slaves’ shackles put on show with sculptures at Liverpool gallery,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/05/slaves-shackles-put-on-show-with-sculptures-at-liverpool-gallery
5/6/2022,"The guessing game over how many runners Aidan O’Brien will field in the Derby continued on Thursday as his colt Star Of India powered home in the Dee Stakes and, barring mishaps, surely booked his place in the Classic. The son of Galileo, already the sire of four of O’Brien’s record eight Derby winners, is now top-priced at 16-1 to win at Epsom next month, joining his stable companions Luxembourg, Point Lonsdale and Changingoftheguard near the top of the ante-post market. O’Brien’s willingness to run any trial winner with the right pedigree in the Epsom Classics makes sense, as at this time of year, his stable is always full of three-year-olds with impeccable 12-furlong pedigrees that have yet to be fully tested at the Derby trip. Star Of India’s win here at 10 furlongs certainly suggested plenty more improvement to come when he steps up to a mile-and-a-half. Ryan Moore’s mount had a couple of lengths to find on the leaders on the home turn and took several strides to find top gear but once he was up to speed, Star Of India surged to the front and was still finding more as he hit the line with just over two lengths to spare. Moore has now ridden three of O’Brien’s Derby candidates – Luxembourg and Changingoftheguard are the others – in the space of six days, but he was reluctant to offer any comparisons with several more Classic trials still to be run over the next few days. “He’s a nice horse and it was only his third run, so that was a good performance,” Moore said. “He’s still learning and things were happening a little quick for him in places, but he got it done well in the end. I think he’ll improve as he’s a very laid-back horse. “It was a big learning curve today. He ran in a straight line at Newmarket and then he’s gone round a bend today. He’s in the mix with the others and he’ll get better, I’ve no doubt about that. I wouldn’t compare him with yesterday’s winner [Changingoftheguard] as they’re slightly different horses. Yesterday’s was very impressive, but the way this race was run meant that he couldn’t be impressive.” When asked if either of his Chester trial winners would compare favourably with Luxembourg, third home in the 2,000 Guineas, Moore remained tight-lipped and retreated into the weighing room. Luxembourg remains 3-1 favourite for the Derby before Lingfield’s Derby Trial on Saturday, when Charlie Appleby’s Walk Of Stars, an 11-1 shot for Epsom, will head a five-runner field. Frankie Dettori and Falcon Eight overcame a slow start from a wide draw to win last year’s Chester Cup with something to spare, and they are likely to head the betting to follow up from a 5lb higher mark on the Roodee on Friday. His rise in the ratings – to a mark of 109 – is modest on the face of it, but 16 horses rated 109 or higher have tried to defy top weight of 9st 12lb in Britain in the last 15 years and just one has succeeded. At his likely price, which will also feel the impact of his rider’s popularity with the punters, Dermot Weld’s gelding looks like a favourite to oppose. The Grand Visir, a two-length runner-up 12 months ago and 7lb better off with the winner, is likely to have been aimed at this from a long way out and makes some each-way appeal at a big price. Rajinsky (3.15), though, is in better form coming into Friday’s race, has an obvious chance on his win at Ascot in October and, as a clincher, the excellent apprentice Harry Davies taking 7lb off his back. He also has an excellent pitch in stall one and looks over-priced at around 12-1 in the early betting. Chester 1.30: Repertoire is hardly maximum-bet material as he can be slow to stride at times and is also 5lb out of the handicap here. There was nothing wrong with his six-length win at Ascot last month, though, the performance that was backed up by the time and he remains on a fair mark on that form. Market Rasen 1.50: Railway Muice was a ready winner of an amateurs’ event over course and distance last month and has decent prospects of a follow-up from a 7lb higher mark. Chester 2.05: This could be the season when Brentford Hope finally fulfils the promise of his winning debut as a juvenile in 2019. His placed form in Pattern events last season suggests he could be up to defying top weight here. Market Rasen: 1.15 William Cody, 1.50 Railway Muice, 2.25 Oslo, 3.00 Jay Bee Why, 3.35 Benito, 4.10 Le Tueur, 4.40 Egbert. Chester: 1.30 Repertoire, 2.05 Brentford Hope, 2.40 Majestic Dawn, 3.15 Rajinsky, 3.45 King’s Lynn, 4.20 Zambezi Magic, 4.55 Bellatrixsa.  Ascot: 2.15 Super Superjack, 2.50 Omniqueen, 3.25 Spyfall, 4.00 Saga (nap), 4.35 Foxy Rascal, 5.10 Akkeringa, 5.40 Paradias. Nottingham: 5.05 Looking For Lynda, 5.35 Toptime, 6.10 West Wind Blows, 6.40 Sylvia Beach, 7.10 Ashky, 7.40 Swiss Ace (nb), 8.10 Invigilate.

5/6/2022,"My great auntie’s definition of a good book – probably a lot of great aunties’, maybe all great aunties’ – was “one that takes you out of yourself”. It is all I am looking for these days, from any of my entertainment media. Those who feel the same will fall like ravening beasts on The Pentaverate (Netflix). This is a six-episode piece of accomplished idiocy by Mike Myers, who has been specialising in such since the early 90s via Saturday Night Live, Wayne’s World, Austin Powers, the Shrek franchise and assorted other ventures. Like Austin Powers, The Pentaverate has Myers playing multiple roles – so many, in fact, that, unless I say otherwise, you can assume all the characters mentioned here are played by him. This includes most of the Pentaverate, a secret society that is, unlike most secret societies, benevolent. (“They’re nice!” they say. We are informed of this at the beginning of every episode via a voiceover by Jeremy Irons, enjoying himself hugely in maximum Jeremy Irons mode.) It was founded in 1347 by five learned men who were denounced as heretics when they worked out that rat fleas, rather than divine will, caused the plague. It has worked behind the scenes for the good of humanity ever since. Darwin, Leonardo, Nelson Mandela and the Quaker Oats guy have all been members. Donald Rumsfeld was a rejected candidate. Billie Eilish is a future member – she will join in 2047. Beyoncé Knowles is with the Illuminati, but working as a Pentaverate double agent. After the untimely and suspicious death of the Pentaverate member Eccleston, the society convinces a reluctant nuclear physicist, Hobart Clark (Keegan-Michael Key), to help them tackle the climate crisis. Rob Lowe, having as much fun as Irons, guides him through the initiation. When a mild-mannered Canadian journalist, Ken Scarborough, is given one last chance to bring back a hard-hitting story to save his job, he and his feisty assistant Reilly (Lydia West) begin investigating the existence of the rumoured society by travelling to New York, getting Scarborough into the society’s Liechtenstein Guard (you need a key fob and a circumcised penis) and becoming caught up in the attempts to destroy the Pentaverate by people in pursuit of gains far in excess of one meeeeellion dollars. But the plot hardly matters. It is the thread upon which Myers can string his beads, including his turn as the ranting Maga-loon Rex Smith, who uses his radio show, Truth Battle, to nonsensically mangle buzzwords in his breathless diatribes against liberals “who dance naked, giving each other lizardman courtesy reacharounds as a sacrifice to the meme-momo”. There are whistlestop gags during Ken and Reilly’s roadtrip about Big Dick’s Halfway Inn and its companion further along the highway, Big Dick’s Old Log (in Nuts Deep). Jennifer Saunders pitches in as the Maester of Dubrovnik, who investigates Eccleston’s death and finds he has been poisoned by a toxin called donnett, which turned the victim’s brown eyes blue. One for all the fans of country singer Crystal Gayle, there. It is a sweet, silly, charmingly harmless thing – and funny, if you like that sort of thing, or if you are scrabbling around for any succour you can find. You could do better; you could do worse. But for between 25 and 28 minutes at a time, it should take you out of yourself and into a world of mustard-robed elders, bum jokes and general daftness.

5/6/2022,"Who is the woman in the window? A housebound mother leaning out to gossip? A lover waiting for a letter? A sex worker summoning clients? An artist installing work in a gallery? As this tightly structured show reveals, the convention of showing women positioned at a window dates back millennia. The oldest artefact here – almost 3,000 years old – is an ivory carving from the Assyrian city of Nimrud, in which a woman gazes over a carved balustrade. She may have represented a cult goddess, or a sacred sex worker watching from a temple. From its earliest representations, the window was presented as a space of display: a pictorial device framing an object of desire. A Greek krater (serving bowl for wine) is decorated with a scene from a comic play. Two grotesque old men complete with padded stomachs and flapping phalluses make an amorous call on a courtesan, whose head and shoulders appear framed in a window. Rembrandt van Rijn’s Girl at a Window (1645), from the Picture Gallery’s collection, seems to have been this show’s starting point. A young woman fiddles with her necklace, her arms framing the exposed skin of her chest as she leans across a ledge and levels an intent gaze at the painter. It’s a curious painting: she emerges from darkness, but there’s no radiant daylight illuminating her as she does so. It feels like a private scene taking place in the gloom of a back street. There’s a big Vermeer-shaped hole here. Rembrandt’s younger compatriot was a master of intimate domestic scenes, many illuminated by a window to the left, the cool northern light from which lit up the faces of women as they read letters, fastened necklaces or played musical instruments. The absence is clearly felt. A reproduction of his Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window (1657–59) is displayed next to Tom Hunter’s photo portrait of a mother in a Hackney squat, Woman Reading a Possession Order (1997), to illustrate the homage this recent political work pays to Vermeer. A high point among some intriguing oddities is a lifesize medieval carving of a martyr’s head viewed through a barricade archway – Saint Avia (The Jailed Woman) (circa 1450-1500). It would have been installed flush with a stone wall, as though Saint Avia were gazing out to receive the bread kneaded by angels that sustained her. For women, the home can be both a sanctuary and a prison. Thus the window, as a threshold between interior and exterior worlds, might present either the possibility of threat or of escape. In many societies it was considered indecent for women to be seen at a public window (and, oh, how artists loved to portray women doing forbidden things, permitting audiences both to ogle and chastise!). Botticelli’s lovely Portrait of a Lady known as Smeralda Bandinelli (1470-80) – a racy proposition only insofar as its subject is pictured at a window, and treating us to a direct gaze – is imagined to have been commissioned for the private enjoyment of her husband. Botticelli kicks off centuries of compositional play, here using the window frame to construct illusory space through which we look at the woman and into the room beyond. There are frames within frames here, all driving attention towards her face, which, thanks to sun pouring from an open balcony to the left, is modelled by the light and shade of a directional light source. There are compositional reasons that artists enjoy picturing figures near windows: it’s not all about voyeurism. While all that compositional business is not really discussed, the most direct reference comes with one of the show’s most surprising and successful inclusions: Isa Genzken’s Fenster (1990). This blunt concrete frame on a spindly metal plinth is displayed in the mausoleum. Bathed in amber light, positioned before a pair of portrait sculptures, it demonstrates the way a frame trains the eye. The final section explores how female artists have approached this territory. Louise Bourgeois used an old window from her home to frame a view across a landscape of curving pinky-white breast forms. From 1978, Cindy Sherman’s Untitled Film Still finds the artist gazing down at the street, dressed as a dancer in ankle socks and tight sweater: a reminder that this convention has long since migrated to cinema. The overarching framing device in this show is identity. The window is explored largely as a narrative device, rather than a pictorial one. Whatever the theme, Marina Abramović can be relied on to go the extra distance. In Role Exchange (1975) she switches identities with a professional sex worker for the opening of her show in Amsterdam. For four hours, each adopts a position in the other’s window. According to Abramović’s suggestive explanatory note, both women “take full responsibility” for their temporary roles.

5/6/2022,"The Nashville public library has debuted new library cards celebrating banned books amid attempts to censor literature throughout the state. Patrons of the Nashville public library system can now get limited-edition bright yellow library cards that say: “I read banned books.” With only 5,000 limited-edition cards available, the Nashville public library hopes to distribute all of them in May to a variety of library users, with existing patrons and first-time visitors eligible for the special cards. The newly released cards are a part of the library’s “Freedom to Read” campaign, a rebuttal to escalating attempts in Tennessee to censor books. “This campaign is our way of bringing our community together in our shared Freedom to Read, which is essential to sustaining our democracy,” said Kent Oliver, the Nashville public library’s director, in a news release announcing the campaign. In Tennessee, conservative lawmakers have forwarded new proposals that drastically censor material within classrooms. In January, a Tennessee school board unanimously voted to ban the Pulitzer prize-winning graphic novel Maus from all its classrooms. Maus, which tells the story of Holocaust survivors, was reportedly banned for eight curse words used in the book and a drawing of a naked mouse. A month later, a separate school board upheld a ban on the 1994 novel Walk Two Moons, which focuses on a 13-year-old Native American girl, after the ban was suggested by a chapter of the conservative group Moms for Liberty. Last month, lawmakers in Tennessee’s house and senate passed legislation that would give a state-run commission the power to ban books in public schools and veto curriculum decisions made by school boards. The Tennessee governor, Bill Lee, has not confirmed if he will sign the bill. While debating such legislation, Tennessee legislators said that they would burn material deemed inappropriate for school libraries, reported the Washington Post. Outside of Tennessee, conservative legislators and parents have called for censorship of a variety of material concerning race, gender, sexuality and other themes deemed inappropriate. As of April, more than 1,500 book bans have been instituted in school districts across the country.",News/US news,Nashville library debuts ‘I read banned books’ cards amid censorship efforts,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/05/nashville-public-library-banned-books-cards
5/6/2022,"A man whose wife died while pregnant with twins after fertility treatment is fighting for the right to use their last remaining frozen embryo to try to have a baby with a surrogate, in a groundbreaking legal case. Ted Jennings, 38, from London, says he is certain that is what his wife, Fern-Marie Choya, would have wanted. But the fertility regulator says this would be unlawful because Choya did not consent to posthumous surrogacy before her sudden death in 2019, while pregnant with twin girls. The case, the first involving posthumous surrogacy, raises fresh ethical questions about the right to pursue parenthood if one partner dies after fertility treatment. Jennings says the clinic did not give the couple sufficient opportunity to consent to this unforeseen scenario, although he had been asked for permission for his wife to pursue posthumous conception in the event of his own death. “It’s not something you would think of when trying to create a life,” Jennings said before the hearing in the family division of the high court in London on Thursday. “You’re thinking of the future, not hoping for the worst possible outcome, and therefore it is up to someone else to present you with the worst-case scenario and ask you if you are prepared for it.” The fertility regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), said it sympathised with Jennings but that in the absence of written consent it would not be lawful to use the remaining embryo, which is stored at the Centre of Reproductive and Genetic Health in London, in treatment with a surrogate. “This is a tragic case and we have every sympathy for Mr Jennings,” Peter Thompson, HFEA chief executive said. “The law is very clear that posthumous use of an embryo with a surrogate can only take place with signed written consent. There is no written consent in this case.” The couple, both originally from Trinidad, met in 2007 in London, where Jennings works in investment banking, and married two years later. After five years of fertility treatment and two miscarriages following ectopic pregnancies, they conceived in 2018 and were overjoyed to be expecting twin girls. But 18 weeks into her pregnancy, Choya suffered a uterine rupture, a severe pregnancy complication. She was taken to hospital by ambulance but died, aged 40, after massive blood loss. Before IVF treatment, Jennings gave consent to the embryos being used in the event of his death, but Choya was not asked the equivalent question. Instead, her form stated that she should seek more information from the clinic “if you wish your eggs or embryos to be used in someone else’s treatment if you die”, which Jennings’ legal team argue appeared designed to cover a different scenario. By contrast, the standard consent forms given to same-sex female couples undergoing IVF treatment explicitly ask about posthumous surrogacy. The court heard that surrogacy was the couple’s “plan B” if the IVF treatment was unsuccessful, and that one of Choya’s sisters had volunteered to act as a surrogate, but they had decided they would prefer a surrogate based in the UK if they went down this route. Speaking before the hearing, Jennings said that he had originally brought the challenge because he did not want the choice to be “taken away” from him through a “bureaucratic oversight”. “But now, as a few more years have passed and I’ve thought about it a bit more, I definitely know that I want to have this child,” he said. In a statement, the court heard Jennings would not be pursuing treatment unless he was absolutely sure it would have been his late wife’s wish. “She was my everything and I was always with her,” he said. “Just as I know she would have wanted me to raise the twin girls to the best of my ability, I know she wants me to try to have our child with our last remaining embryo.” James Lawford Davies, Jennings’ lawyer and a partner at Hill Dickinson, said: “It is clear that Fern would have wanted Ted to be able to use this embryo, and that she would have done whatever was required to facilitate this. Ted’s wish to use the embryo should not be frustrated because of a missing tick in a box.” Thompson said: “The last thing the HFEA wishes to do is to stand in the way of Mr Jennings, but we have to regulate in accordance with the law. As the law stands, there is nothing the HFEA could do to remove the need for written consent in such cases.” The case will now be determined by a family division judge, Mrs Justice Theis.",News/Society,UK man brings high court case to have dead wife’s baby with surrogate,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/05/uk-man-brings-high-court-case-to-have-dead-wifes-baby-with-surrogate
5/6/2022,"Antonio Conte says he is relishing the opportunity to go “face to face” with Liverpool on Saturday as Tottenham continue their pursuit of a Champions League place. The Spurs manager was full of praise for Jürgen Klopp’s quadruple-chasing team and the “200% enthusiasm” that means they could still win every competition they entered. But he believes a game where the opponents come with an attacking approach will suit his developing side. “It is very difficult to play against Liverpool – they are in really good form,” Conte said. “I watched [the Champions League semi-final against] Villarreal and the composure, the calm was incredible. The team is strong, it is one of the best in the world. At the same time it will be a good game for us. “Whenever you play these top teams it is important there is the great desire to find a way to stop them. Against Manchester City it happened twice and against Liverpool we drew at home. For sure I think it’s better when you play face to face with these teams than when we find a team who are very very deep with not so much of the ball.” Spurs have dropped points against Brighton and Brentford in recent weeks, failing to register a shot on target against sides who played in compact formations. Last weekend, however, Tottenham returned to winning ways with a comprehensive 3-0 victory against Leicester. “Against Leicester we played face to face: you attack, we attack,” Conte said. “For us it’s better, given the characteristic of our players.” Conte refused to be drawn on how he would approach the challenge of breaking Liverpool’s suffocating press. “I don’t want to give an advantage to a team that doesn’t need one,” he said. But of his opponents’ push for unprecedented silverware, Conte was highly complimentary. “Klopp is doing a fantastic job,” he said. “It’s not easy, especially for an English team, to arrive at the end of the season and be competing for all competitions. Liverpool players run a lot and the fact they have not many injuries [means] the enthusiasm is not 100%, it is 200%. You don’t feel the fatigue when you arrive at this point. We want to go there to play our game and we know very well that we are in the race for a Champions League place and we have to try to get a point in every game.”",Sport/Football,"Going ‘face to face’ with Liverpool could suit Spurs, claims Antonio Conte",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/05/going-face-to-face-with-liverpool-will-suit-spurs-claims-antonio-conte
5/6/2022,"Nazarii has spent the last three weeks listening to fighter planes fly over his village in western Ukraine and hoping that his British visa will arrive soon. The 17-year-old applied to join a family in Hampshire under the Homes for Ukraine scheme on 11 April and thought it would be straightforward. But with no decision from the Home Office, it appears Nazarii may be the latest casualty of a government policy that denies visas to unaccompanied children. Under-18s travelling alone are not permitted to be hosted under the Homes for Ukraine programme, leaving them with no route to Britain. British families that have been carefully vetted and subject to enhanced DBS checks are frustrated that they cannot help teenagers with whom they have been matched. Many are already alone and vulnerable to trafficking and abuse. The government claims the policy is designed to safeguard children, but by offering no alternative, charities say it could leave young people in greater danger in Ukraine and elsewhere in Europe. For Nazarii, travelling with his parents is not an option. His mother has to care for elderly relatives in their village near Ternopil and his father is a much-needed doctor. His potential host, Samantha Read, 54, from Church Crookham in Hampshire, works as a teaching assistant and lives with her husband, Tim, and their 17-year-old son, Theo. She said she rang the Home Office helpline at the start of April to ask if she could host a 17-year-old and was told it was fine if there was written parental permission. After DBS checks and vetting by social services they were expecting the visa any day. Speaking about Nazarii’s parents, Read said: “All they want is to keep their son safe so he can have a positive future. We have formed a bond with this family. We know we can support him emotionally, financially, provide a safe haven in a loving family home. “Is it really too much to ask that the Home Office grant this visa as they told me they would in a timely manner?” Meanwhile, Nazarii is left wondering how he will find safety. “I often hear many sirens and military planes, terrible sounds,” he said. Robina Qureshi, chief executive of the refugee hosting charity Positive Action In Housing, said: “The thing that is most shocking about this is that the most vulnerable of refugees, unaccompanied children, are being denied access to the UK.” Qureshi wants established charities like hers, with experience of placing refugees with families, to be allowed to bring teenagers to Britain. “We need the government to act urgently for the sake of 18 unaccompanied minors who we are supporting at present who are at risk of trafficking or being forced to live in or return to a war zone. They are frankly terrified,” she said. Kostiantyn and Sasha, both 17, are sleeping on a stranger’s sofa in Warsaw having fled Ukraine at the end of February. The friends, who were studying engineering and maths at college together in Kyiv, speak fluent English and no Polish. They were matched by Positive Action In Housing with a carefully vetted couple in Manchester. Kostiantyn said: “We were convinced everything was going to be alright but now we’ve discovered that we can’t come without our parents and it seems impossible. “In Ukraine if you’re 16 you can travel – you don’t need to ask your parent.” Dennis Colligan, 60, a GP from Didsbury in Manchester, agreed to host the boys along with his wife, Cathy, 59, a speech therapist. Both have enhanced criminal records checks as part of their jobs and empty spare rooms as their three adult children have left home. Colligan said: “It’s very disappointing because we’ve got a situation that would work. Cathy and I have got the space, we’ve got the resources and we’ve got a background in knowing about safeguarding, children, health and welfare. “It seems a real shame that we can’t actually get them over here and get them settled, so they feel safe and can resume their education.” Kostiantyn’s mother has stayed in Ukraine to support his father and he wants to be able to work and send money home to support his family. Sasha’s mother has gone to France. They are nervous of the risks if the placement falls through. Sasha said: “We want to travel to the United Kingdom because we have a sponsor here – we already know we’ll find a place to sleep and a friend in Manchester who’s a really nice person. But we don’t have all of these benefits in other countries like France or Germany, so it’s more dangerous to go there.” Dan Paskins, director of UK impact at Save the Children, said “The government’s ‘one size fits all’ approach in these instances can put children at risk of taking dangerous routes to seek safety. “What’s needed are caseworkers who are on the ground, who have the skills, background and knowledge to be able to make a really informed and rapid assessment of each individual case – particularly for children coming to live with adults with whom they have a longstanding relationship.” A government spokesperson said: “Due to safeguarding concerns, unaccompanied minors are only eligible under the Homes for Ukraine scheme if they are reuniting with a parent or legal guardian in the UK. “There are no plans to make those trying to sponsor unaccompanied children ‘guardians’.”",News/UK news,The Ukrainian children at the mercy of UK’s refugee scheme,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/05/ukrainian-children-at-mercy-of-uk-refugee-scheme-homes-for-ukraine
5/6/2022,"On Wednesday night, late-night hosts condemned the leaked supreme court draft opinion to overturn Roe v Wade, and how Republican lawmakers focused on the leak itself and not the dire consequences of the decision. “It won’t surprise you to learn that even as they appear poised to shred the fundamental rights of tens of millions of women and reap the biggest political victory in 50 years, conservatives are still whining and casting themselves as victims because of the leak,” said Seth Meyers on Late Night. Meyers mocked Fox News hosts who referred to the leak as an “insurrection” of the court. “The fact that they’re all freaking out about the leak instead of celebrating the victory is telling,” he said. “It underscores yet again that even at the height of their powers, these people always have to play the victim. If they win a free car on Wheel of Fortune they’d immediately start whining ‘but I already have two cars in my garage, I don’t have space for a brand new Stingray, this is so unfair!’ “Do all these pundits whining about the leak really think this is what will shatter the integrity of the court?” he added. “Not the fact that Republicans stole a seat from President Obama, or the fact several of their nominees apparently lied to the Senate about their positions on Roe, or the fact that one of them called opposition to his nomination based on credible sexual assault allegations a ‘smear campaign’ orchestrated by shadowy leftwing groups and the Clintons?” “I could go on, so I will,” Meyers continued, tearing through a laundry list of conservatives discrediting the court. “The fact they rushed through another nominee a little over a week before the election, whose ceremony turned out to be a super-spreader event, and who posed for a political photo op with the president after her confirmation. “Or the fact that another justice declined to recuse himself from a case that potentially involved text messages sent by his wife that would reveal her involvement in attempts to overthrow the presidential election and install Donald Trump as an unelected autocrat. Or the fact that one of them got caught flushing a toilet during an oral argument conducted via telephone?” Regardless of the final text of the ruling, he added, “this is the culmination of a decades-long effort by conservatives to turn the court into a political weapon and aim it straight at abortion rights.” Chief Justice Roberts announces an investigation to identify the leaker, but Fox News doesn't have time to wait around. pic.twitter.com/CBjH01GGr2 “Many people are horrified” after Monday’s leaked opinion, said Trevor Noah on The Daily Show. “Not that women and half the country would lose their rights over their own bodies, but rather that this information got leaked. Which is weird. It’s like running around the deck of the Titanic trying to find out who yelled ‘We’re sinking!’ instead of focusing on the iceberg.” Chief Justice John Roberts has announced an immediate investigation to identify the leaker. “But cable news doesn’t have time to wait around,” Noah said, queueing up clips of speculation from various news channels. “Yes, it was a leftwing antifa law clerk trying to sabotage the court!” he mocked. “Or it was a rightwing Maga-head trying to lock the decision in place. Or, maybe, it was the butler. It’s always the butler! “But while everyone on regular cable channels was playing the least horny version of Knives Out, Newsmax had already cracked the case” by blaming, with zero evidence, recently appointed justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. “Look at you, using the tried and true investigative technique of ‘The black person did it!’” Noah joked. “Of course, after years of packing the supreme court with the expressed intention of overturning Roe v Wade, Republicans in Congress took a victory lap,” said Stephen Colbert over a video of silent tumbleweeds. “Oh, right, I forgot. They’re cowards, cause they know it’s really unpopular, so they didn’t talk about the actual decision. Instead, Republicans focused on the unprecedented nature of the leak itself. “Look, I can understand the argument that this leak is bad for the institution of the supreme court,” said the Late Show host. “But come on, do you think that waiting to release it this summer was going to make it a hot beach read? ‘Your body, his choice?’” Colbert homed in on the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, who urged people to “concentrate on what the news is today, not a leaked draft but the fact that the draft was leaked”. “Mitch, is everything OK in the old squirrel cage? You been snacking on paint chips? Because you’re ignoring the important part,” Colbert said. “You’re like a husband getting a ransom note – ‘Oh my God! Look at all the letters they cut out of a magazine! They’ve ruined my collection of National Geographics.’ “As usual, Fox News was committed to not reporting the news,” he added, “and instead reporting spin that the leaked draft was somehow a win for Democrats.” To quote former Trump adviser and Fox News pundit Kellyanne Conway: “It’s very curious to me that the Democrats weren’t talking about it until today. “Typically people wait until something happens to talk about it,” Colbert retorted. “Nobody on the Titanic was complaining about icebergs when they left the harbor.”",Arts/Culture,Seth Meyers on the abortion ruling: conservatives ‘always have to play the victim’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/may/05/seth-meyers-abortion-ruling-conservatives-late-night-tv
5/6/2022,"“Things have happened that no one could possibly imagine,” Carlo Ancelotti said, but you might have heard that one before. You might have seen something a little like this too: last time, for a start. And the time before that. Real Madrid’s players certainly had, that very morning. At the end of another night so ludicrous that in the middle of the madness with the match still going on and tie not yet won Marcelo grabbed his manager and actually started laughing, Ancelotti admitted that he had shown the squad a video depicting Madrid’s eight – eight! – comebacks. And that’s just this season. At the end, he told them there was one missing. The best one of all. There were 39 seconds left and Real Madrid needed to score twice or they were out, halted at the gates of the final, their luck running out at last. Eighty-eight seconds later they had done, collective madness taking everyone. Somehow, they had forced extra time; soon, they had the winner, which by then you knew they would. Look in the top corner of your screen. It had shown 89:20 RMA 0 – 1 MCI (3-5). Look again and it showed: 94.13 RMA 3 – 1 MCI (6-5). And it had taken a few seconds to update the score. “Incredible, isn’t it?” Casemiro said. That’s one word for it, yeah. And one word was all Thibaut Courtois had, or so he said: “Madrid,” he replied when asked whether he could explain it. Mostly, they couldn’t. Ancelotti shrugged and smiled. “The greatness of this club,” he said. Kroos described the team as a “joke”. Rodrygo said: “We were dead … and then what happened, happened.” What happened was the most ridiculous resurrection of them all: even more implausible, the margins finer, the race against the clock more frantic, like they were watching that video back again only on fast-forward, everything flashing by. And when it came there was something in that idea: the impact of this, the inception too, was not just about what happened on Wednesday but what had happened on those other nights. It was the last in a crescendo of comebacks, each feeding off the last, miracle of miracles. The culmination of the most incredible run to a European Cup final ever, layer upon layer. “One of these days my heart will stop,” Emilio Butragueño said after. The front of Marca demanded that God come down from heaven to explain this. “The paranormal has become normal,” AS’s headline ran. Presented with that idea, Ancelotti conceded: “Something strange has happened.” Something familiar too. Groundhog Day, The Never Ending Story. Ctrl C, ctrl V. They had done it to Paris Saint-Germain. They had done it to Chelsea. And now they had done it to Manchester City. The champions of France, Europe and England all eliminated at the Bernabéu. Just don’t ask them to work out how. This is just what they do. They had beaten the Italian champions too. This season, Madrid’s Champions League campaign began with an 89th-minute winner against Internazionale. In the next game they were beaten by the Moldovan side Sheriff, source of a million memes. Shot down, but up again and now in the final, like this. Better this way, their way. This is the club that rescued the 2014 European Cup against Atlético with a 93rd-minute equaliser, that constructed a legend, an identity around comebacks, history invited to play. The team that have made the impossible feel inevitable, embracing the chaos. Which doesn’t necessarily make it easier to understand. Or to analyse. But sometimes it is better for everyone else to embrace the chaos too. Don’t try to get it or explain it. There will be time for analysis, for breaking it all down, trying to make sense of it. For sweeping conclusions too. This was a time to live it, marvel in the madness, the football, bloody hell. Against PSG they had come down from 1-0 down, 2-0 on aggregate to win 3-2, gifted a way back and scoring twice in a minute, three in quarter of an hour. Against Chelsea, they had gone from 3-0 down on the night, 4-3 down on aggregate, with 10 minutes left, to win 5-4 on aggregate. It had been extraordinary that they were even standing, but this is the team you have to kill a hundred times. If not, know that they’re coming for you. There may be a case for saying that of the 12 halves of normal time against PSG, Chelsea and City, Madrid were the better side in just one – the first half in London – but they’re the only one left. In Paris, PSG had taken 23 shots, Madrid three. It was 8-0 in shots on target, but only 1-0 on the scoreboard. In Madrid, Kylian Mbappé had the ball in the net three times, twice ruled out, and the place had been resigned to defeat, the first whistles appearing, before David Alaba and Éder Militão dived into a tackle that was a bugle call and Gianluigi Donnarumma’s dreadful error ignited everything. Against Chelsea, they had faced 28 shots at the Bernabéu. Even at Stamford Bridge they had faced 20 shots, clear chances wasted by Chelsea. An error from Édouard Mendy had given them the third goal. In Manchester Real Madrid faced 16 shots. They were beaten 4-3, but celebrated that almost as a victory, given how overrun they had been, aware that the difference could have been far greater; rarely can City have felt more like they had lost a game that they had won. They knew. Madrid were still there. But then City scored at the Bernabéu. “We were so close,” Pep Guardiola said, and they really were. Into the last minute, Madrid needed two. At that point, a second goal for City felt closer than a first for Madrid. Outside, TV cameras interviewed the stupidest person on the planet. A Madrid fan who had decided to leave early heard the roar from inside while he was talking. “We’ve come back, we’ve come back!” he shouted, leaping about celebrating. There’s something about that “we” that stuck in the throat. He wasn’t alone, some fans turning and trying to get back in. Had they learned nothing? Do they not know this team they support? Of course you have come back, you fool. 🏆🌟 ¡QUE LOCURA EN LOS ALEDAÑOS DEL BERNABÉU CON EL SEGUNDO GOL DEL MADRID!#UCL📹 @Alvaro_rprats⚽️ La locura de todo el público.... ¡NOS VAMOS A LA PRÓRROGA! pic.twitter.com/W0FvRwACdj City had led from 1:32 in the first leg until 90:50 in the second. It was hard to fathom, but this was a fate everyone foresaw. Except, it had reached the point where even the believers were having a hard time believing. This was beyond even Madrid. When Jack Grealish’s shot went just past the post, it didn’t really feel like it mattered all that much. Oh, ye of little faith. Oh, it mattered. It was everything, as it turned out. Courtois’ studs had diverted it wide. Not a boot: a stud, a measure of how fine the margin was, another incredible save keeping them alive. Ferland Mendy cleared off the line, the still photo of it a portrait of some sort of divine intervention. It wasn’t just that he got there but that Phil Foden, inches from the line, the ball actually touching him, didn’t. It was the 87th minute and it was a miracle, but a bigger one was coming now. “That feeling that happens in football sometimes, that has happened in history, when you are leading but you’re being dominated: that didn’t happen to us,” the City manager said. “We did not feel like we were under siege. And then they found the goal. Then one minute later, they found another. They have done it lots of times in their history, so it could happen to us.” When the first went in, 70,000 people reached out and touched faith. This could actually happen. Could happen? Is happening. All those other times, all those tales, made it more likely: it is something self-perpetuating, an identity built to be lived up to, a history to emulate, and it is felt by both teams. “They know anything can happen here,” Courtois said. There wasn’t that much City clearly got wrong – although restarting quickly and giving the ball back to Madrid to allow them to score a second goal 88 seconds after the first was a dreadful error – but they had been unable to resist. There was something mystical at play; some fate, some force, that means that the more you fight it, the more inevitable it becomes. Or maybe it’s more simple than that: stuff happens. “Magic doesn’t begin to cover it,” Jorge Valdano said. “Another mad night,” Federico Valverde called it. “I think God looked at me and said: ‘Today is your day,’” Rodrygo suggested. “No one, no one thought we would play the final, and we’re there,” Ancelotti said. Butragueño said: “In the directors’ box, people were saying it’s incredible and you say: ‘Yeah, but we’re Real Madrid and it’s happened lots of times.’” The players knew: they had seen the video that proves it.",Sport/Football,Real Madrid’s latest miracle is a tale of 88 seconds and one Ancelotti video | Sid Lowe,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/05/real-madrid-latest-miracle-88-seconds-one-ancelotti-video-manchester-city-champions-league-final
5/6/2022,"A hillwalker, surveyor and map-maker has pinpointed what he believes is a new mountain in north Wales that has been created by quarrying. Myrddyn Phillips, who has spent the last two decades sizing up obscure peaks to judge if they qualify for mountain status, has concluded a piece of high ground at a quarry near Blaenau Ffestiniog passes the test. Phillips said that part of a peak called Manod Mawr North Top had been eroded by quarrying, leading to the formation of a second top, slightly lower – but high enough to qualify as a mountain. It is to be added to Phillips’ list of “Welsh Highlands” – hills in Wales that are more than 2,000ft (609 metres) high with a 49ft drop to the col – the saddle or ridge between two peaks. He said it was the first time since the list was launched in 2004 that a chunk of high ground in Wales had been upgraded to mountain status because of human intervention. Phillips, from Welshpool, mid-Wales, said: “The mountain was first spotted on an online map by a colleague of mine – I was intrigued and needed to see this unusual peak myself. “Nobody really knew it existed because it doesn’t show up on the OS maps. I was looking for the vertical height gain between the col and the summit. It had once been relatively flat as it connected to the Manod Mawr North Top. By quarrying that ridge, they have created a brand new peak.” Phillips said he hoped the discovery would give people enthusiasm to get out and explore the local mountain ranges – though the new peak is on private ground. “Since I have taken up surveying, the areas it has taken me to is fantastic. You see places you otherwise would never have discovered – some of them are so beautiful.” Phillips made headlines in 2019 when he showed that a street in Harlech, north-west Wales, was apparently the steepest in the world – though the coastal town lost the title to Dunedin in New Zealand the following year. In 2010 Glyder Fawr, in Snowdonia, was redefined as a “super mountain” after surveyors found it was 1,000 metres high rather than the 999 metres it had previously been thought to measure.",News/UK news,A sneaky peak: Wales gains a mountain because of quarrying,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/05/wales-gains-a-mountain-quarrying-blaenau-ffestiniog
5/6/2022,"Durham’s former police chief has condemned attempts to get his former force to investigate Keir Starmer over allegations of Covid rule-breaking as “hypocritical” and “dangerous” and said there is no evidence the Labour leader flouted the law. Michael Barton, chief constable of Durham until 2019, said the pressure on police to investigate was politically motivated. In his time in charge, Durham was rated as one of the best-performing police forces. Though the Labour leader initially struggled to answer questions about the event in interviews, he said Durham police had not contacted him about drinking a beer and eating a takeaway with staff in a constituency office last year, as he said he was always “very careful” to abide by lockdown rules. Labour said the takeaway was necessary for campaign staff, who carried on working while eating. But reports have questioned the volume of food and alcohol supplied as well as Labour’s claim there were no alternative options for dinner. Barton said of those pressing police to investigate, including Conservative MPs and rightwing newspapers: “They are using operational policing as a political football, which is dangerous and ought to be condemned. “For the same people who said Dominic Cummings had done nothing wrong to demand police action is both hypocritical and dangerous. It means operational policing is being dragged into a political minefield.” He said all the circumstances around Starmer were hugely different to those surrounding Boris Johnson’s law-breaking. Barton said: “The only reason that those offences should be looked at in retrospect is if the people who made the laws, broke the laws. That is why it was crucial the gatherings in Westminster were investigated.” He likened those demanding Starmer be investigated to malicious neighbours plaguing police with vexatious complaints: “All forces saw calls on neighbours increase during Covid from people using Covid as cover for longstanding disputes. That’s what this is. “Just because someone is drinking beer does not mean it is a social gathering. There is no rule against alcohol.” Starmer said the food had been ordered as the staff prepared an online event for members. “In Durham, all restaurants and pubs were closed, so takeaways really were the only way you could eat. So this was brought in and at various points people went through to the kitchen and had something to eat, and got on with their work,” he said. He added: “We were very careful to abide by the rules … and we did it within my family. My wife’s father is very elderly and had to shield in difficult circumstances that I won’t go into. My wife went and sat on the pavement outside his house. All she wanted to do, like many families, is she wanted to go in and clean and she didn’t because the rules didn’t allow her. So I know what that feels like.” Starmer has previously accused the Tories of “mudslinging” over their allegations that he broke Covid rules, in order to distract from the prime minister’s own lawbreaking, for which he was issued a fixed-penalty notice. Johnson paid a fine for attending his birthday party in June 2020, and is still under investigation over his alleged attendance at several other parties. A spokesperson for the Durham force earlier said: “Durham constabulary has reviewed video footage recorded in Durham on 30 April 2021. We do not believe an offence has been established in relation to the legislation and guidance in place at that time and will therefore take no further action in relation to this matter.” The force subsequently confirmed it had received a large volume of correspondence on the matter and would respond in due course.",News/Politics,Former police chief condemns pressure to investigate Keir Starmer’s office beer,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/05/keir-starmer-lockdown-takeaway-former-police-chief
5/6/2022,"Lori Lightfoot’s launch of Chicago’s own brand of canned water under the name “Chicagwa” may have created more waves than she expected. On Tuesday, the city’s mayor unveiled the artfully designed cans of Chicago tap water to celebrate their water source, Lake Michigan, in honor of National Drinking Water Week. But the city has been identified as having more potentially toxic lead pipes delivering that water to homes than anywhere else in the US – a fact that concerned locals are now reminding people about. “No, this water isn’t from an exotic island around Fiji, or from some fancy glacier out in Scandinavia. It’s from Chicago,” said the tongue-in-cheek marketing website for the new limited-edition cans, promoting the “clean, delicious drinking water” the city gets by being next to “the greatest of all Great Lakes”. “So whether you’re drinking Chicagwa from a can or any faucet or garden hose in the Chicago metropolitan area, enjoy,” it said. But the launch has been met with criticism from environmentalists and local activists, who said the city hasn’t done enough to help the thousands of residents who are still drinking their lake water through lead pipes. “We need less Chicagwa and more political will to get the lead out of our drinking water,” wrote Gina Ramirez of the Chicago office of the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) in a blogpost, noting that an estimated 400,000 homes in Chicago still have lead lines delivering water from the street. “So many folks in my community buy bottled water because they don’t trust their taps. Let’s do better and actually start addressing this public health issue by replacing lead lines.” Lead is a dangerous toxin known to cause brain damage in children and numerous health effects in adults. The CDC has said there is “no safe level” of lead in children’s blood. And Joe Biden has raised $15bn to replace some of the lead pipes in US cities.. A succession of Chicago mayoral administrations have been criticized for not getting serious enough about the lead water service line problem – which is expected to take up to $9bn and 50 years to fix. But Lightfoot campaigned on the issue and promised in 2021, “we’re not kicking the can down the road any more”. Progress has been glacial, however. Despite promising to fix 600 lead service lines in 2021, only 20 have been replaced so far, according to an investigation by CBS Chicago. In a press conference, the mayor said the cans of “Chicagwa” water, featuring colorful designs from local artists, will be given away for free at restaurants and events around the city over the next few months. She touted several changes her administration has made to the water system, including stopping water shutoffs for residents who can’t pay, but did not mention the lead problem. “What we’ve done in investments that we’ve made is really step up our ability to deliver clean, safe drinking water to Chicagoans and our regional partners for decades to come,” she said. But the announcement was met on Twitter and elsewhere with a wave of what Eater Chicago described as classic Chicagoan snark. “The cans are lead-lined for authenticity,” quipped traffic reporter Mike Pries.",News/US news,Chicago launches ‘delicious’ canned water brand – just don’t mention the city’s toxic water crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/05/chicagwa-chicago-unveils-artful-cans-tap-water-toxic-lead-pipes
