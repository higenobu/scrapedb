2/6/2022,"A majority of Conservative voters want their party to deliver more affordable housing and let councils buy up empty properties, according to new polling which suggests that public frustration with the housing crisis is now more evenly spread across the political divide. Two-thirds of Tories want new-build developments to include more affordable homes and 68% want higher taxes on second homes and empty properties, according to YouGov polling shared with the Guardian.  The research comes after the Levelling Up white paper disappointed some housing campaigners by failing to set targets for increasing the supply of low-rent homes, which is seen by many as a key weapon in the fight against the cost of living crisis. A large minority of Conservative voters – 39% – support giving private renters indefinite tenancies which can only be ended when a tenant wants to move or in cases of criminal damage or severe rent arrears. Such a policy would go much further than the ban on no-fault evictions that Michael Gove, the secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities, last week said he would deliver. Matt Downie, the chief executive of Crisis, a charity for homeless people, said: “If there is clear cross-party support for making sure that people on lower or no incomes have somewhere stable to live, we’d urge the government to take action on that and start to unravel the enormous housing crisis facing this country. “One of the most obvious ways we can tackle the cost of living crisis is to bring down housing costs.” A study by Heriot-Watt University estimated that 90,000 more social homes need to be built every year to meet demand. But in the year 2020-21, housing associations built 26,010 new homes in England, which was the lowest level since 2016-17, while only 1,650 council homes were built – the fewest since 2014/15. The official figures mean affordable homes accounted for just 18% of new housebuilding. Home ownership among 25- to 34-year-olds has fallen from 51% in 1989 to 28% in 2019, according to the Resolution Foundation. Downie said it was “heartening” that there was such support for increasing the amount of social housing built as part of new developments, which he said was “shockingly low despite there being an obligation [on developers] in theory”. Many developers are able to argue that their schemes would not be financially viable if they had to build large numbers of affordable homes, meaning that local authorities are obliged to dilute their targets for cheap housing. “There is support among both Labour and Conservative voters for almost all the policies we asked about,” said a spokesperson for YouGov. “While Labour voters tend to be more strongly in favour of these policies, foreign investment in the UK house market is more unpopular with Conservatives – 56% of Tory voters would support an end to non-domiciled property ownership, compared with 45% of Labour voters.”",News/Politics,"Most Tory voters want more affordable housing stock, finds poll",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/06/most-tory-voters-want-more-affordable-housing-stock-finds-poll
2/6/2022,"“What do you see when you look at me?” chant The PappyShow’s ragtag, 13-strong cast of varying races, ages, genders and abilities. Taking the question at face value, performer Bea Holland explains that the eye itself sees nothing; it’s the brain that does the seeing. It’s a neat opening move, and the freewheeling scenes and scenarios that follow dive with some gusto into that very gap: between seeing and looking, perceiving and conceiving; between us and them, and you and me. The cast introduce themselves with affectionate cliches that are rudimentary stereotypes nonetheless: a singsong Italian accent (Debora Minà), kungfu kicks (Jules Chan), bhangra dancing (Simran Hunjun). Later, when we’re softened up, a fashion parade exaggerates and furthermore mismatches the stereotypes: a black woman in a wheelchair rolls up in Breton sailor drag, complete with boating hat, striped jersey and baguette; an east Asian man sports a Rastacap and dreadlock wig; a white woman with a crutch walks on in a black face mask.  Later still, they apologise for the blatant cultural appropriation – but characteristically, this becomes less a position statement than an opportunity to riff on the gaps between the making, meaning and believing of apologies: they poke fun at each other’s duplicitous expressions of regret (“I’m sorry I portrayed violence to give the show more drama”), and niftily quote from one of the latest offerings from our prime minister. The evening is full of scenes that cut one way, and undercut another. The cast’s pastel tops form a lovely rainbow when they line up in order of height, but ranked by age or hair-length it’s a mess. Their synchronised-swimming choreography is laughably amateur alongside the machined, identikit precision of the top team on a video projection – but there’s no doubt who looks more human. Therein lies its charm. The devised format and workshoppy feel do make for a patchy evening, and the cultural diversity theme could have made for a stilted one; but the ambience is very convivial – we’re all in this together, somehow – and no one, on stage or in the audience, is reduced from a person to a position.

2/6/2022,"Anglers are “heartbroken” after a 250-metre stretch of the River Tone in Somerset was stripped of trees by the Environment Agency as part of flood management measures. The semi-wild section of river running through Taunton was a popular spot for anglers and wildlife-lovers, where kingfishers were often spotted. However, the majority of trees were felled last week, leaving the banks of the river as bare earth.  Dominic Garnett, 42, an angling guide and coach, has fished the stretch of the river for the past 20 years and has been visiting it since childhood. “It was a semi-wild stretch of river and they have channelised it,” he told PA. “It is absolutely heartbreaking to see the destruction of the places you love – you go there to be with nature and to get away and it’s all just been ripped away.” The length of the river ran through marshland until the 1990s, when the surrounding land was tarmacked to make way for housing and a leisure and shopping complex.Garnett said the area is now prone to flooding. While woodland planting is often used as a flood mitigation strategy, Garnett said representatives of the Environment Agency had told him the trees were felled “because they make the water back up”. “It is like they have taken an old hippie and given him a buzz cut – it is scorched earth tactics.”He pointed out that huge swathes of trees had been cleared only weeks away from nesting season, with river plants dredged out when some species of fish are starting to spawn. “It makes them vulnerable to predators – fish need places to hide,” he said. Mark Barrow, a film-maker who has specialised in productions about freshwater species in the UK’s rivers and lakes for the past 20 years, tweeted that he was “shocked” to discover the scene on the River Tone. “Complete devastation, courtesy of the Environment Agency. Scorched earth work the Russian army would be proud of! Those stumps were decades old trees where I used to watch the local kingfisher. Everything is now disappearing.” A spokeswoman for the Environment Agency said: “Essential work to manage flood risk and protect properties in Bathpool and the upstream town of Taunton is ongoing.“We always work to minimise any impact to the environment when carrying out work and have measures in place to compensate, such as new tree planting. Flooding and coastal erosion can have terrible consequences for people, businesses and the environment.It is understood the trees at water level were deemed to be creating a flood risk by catching debris and restricting the flow of water. The area is due to be sown with a wild flower seed mix and replanted with native trees.",News/Environment,Anglers ‘heartbroken’ as stretch of River Tone stripped of trees,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/06/anglers-heartbroken-as-stretch-of-river-tone-stripped-of-trees

2/6/2022,"The No 10 Downing Street team seems to have moved swiftly from handing out “red meat” to the Tory right to handing in their resignation letters. Now obviously no one wants to lose their job, but if it is going to happen make sure you’re in the right country. Specifically, Denmark. That’s the lesson of a paper exploring the impact of job loss on future employment and earnings. Workers losing their jobs in southern European countries are on average paid 30% less five years later compared with 10% in Scandinavia, mainly because they are less likely to have a job, but also because they end up working for lower-paying firms. Recent Resolution Foundation research has shown that losing your job also results in future pay penalties in the UK.  But what is driving the more positive outcomes in Scandinavia? Active labour market policies, which give people support to connect them to good jobs, are where the authors point the fingers. Which is awkward, given the UK spends less than most OECD countries on such policies. Instead, we are busy with the government’s latest sanctions-driven Way to Work campaign to force the short-term unemployed to take any job immediately. This is madness, first because the short-term unemployed are already flowing swiftly back into work and second because it ignores the real problem: the half a million workers who have dropped out of the labour market entirely thanks to the pandemic. Designing active labour market policies for this, and for those affected by the impact of Covid, Brexit and net zero-induced change through the 2020s, is the task we face. And if that helps an ex-Downing Street adviser or two in the meantime, all the better.  Torsten Bell is chief executive of the Resolution Foundation.

2/6/2022,"A comprehensive review of recent studies into a chemical often used in plastics and resins has revealed that the average American is exposed to levels of the dangerous compound that are 5,000 times higher than what the European Union now considers safe. The main exposure route for bisphenol-A (BPA) is via plastic and metal food packaging, and that has prompted a call for strong new limits on its use.  In a petition sent last week to the US Food and Drug Administration, consumer advocates and food safety scientists led by the Environmental Defense Fund warned that the European Food Safety Authority’s (EFSA) December review clearly shows that BPA exposure levels in the US represent a “high health risk” for Americans of all ages. “The FDA has an obligation to protect us from toxic chemicals that can come in contact with our food,” said Maricel Maffini, a petition co-author. “These new findings should be a wakeup call to the FDA and all of us that our health is in jeopardy unless we take swift action to limit the amount of BPA that can come into contact with our food.” The chemical mimics estrogen and is linked to a range of serious health problems, including cancer, immunotoxicity, neurological toxicity, mammary gland disease, behavioral changes and decreased sperm counts, among others. Male and female brains in mammals are physically different, and Maffini noted a study that found BPA exposure altered male brains to look more like female brains. EFSA’s research pointed to evidence suggesting harm from BPA exposure can occur at levels 100,000 times lower than previously thought, and scientists have found immune system disruptions occur at particularly low levels. “What we are seeing now is that the levels that we thought were safe – they don’t seem to be safe, and the levels that we identify as causing problems in the immune system are incredibly low,” Maffini said. In food packaging, BPA is typically used to line metal cans to prevent corrosion, though plenty of safer alternatives exist, Maffini said. It’s also mixed into polycarbonate plastic, which is a clear, shatterproof material used in multi-use water bottles, containers that hold pre-prepared foods or containers used to hold ingredients during food prep, among other uses. The petition asks that those applications be prohibited. The FDA has 180 days to respond to the petition, though it can take longer on complex issues, Maffini said. Consumer groups’ petitions have led to some success in recent years. The FDA agreed with a 2016 petition led by the Environmental Defense Fund to ban the use of long-chain PFAS in food packaging, though it has yet to respond to a 2021 petition to ban all PFAS. A 2015 EDF-led petition to prohibit seven carcinogenic food flavorings resulted in the FDA banning the substances in 2018. However, the FDA’s science and position on BPA has often been at odds with that of academic scientists, consumer advocates, the US National Toxicology Program, and the FDA’s own advisory committees, Maffini said. While those groups have consistently found BPA to present a dangerous health threat, the FDA has downplayed the dangers and often relied on inadequate scientific methods to arrive at its conclusions, Maffini said. However, the FDA banned BPA from baby bottles, sippy cups and infant formula packaging in 2012. The agency said in a statement that it doesn’t comment on pending petitions.",News/US news,Americans exposed to toxic BPA at levels far above what EU considers safe – study,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/06/americans-exposed-toxic-bpa-fda-study

2/6/2022,"Manchester has long liked garnishing industry with ornament. For all the four-square practicality of its Victorian streets, its buildings are eclectic in their detail – Byzantine, Flemish, gothic and baroque, encrusted and polychrome, with turrets, domes, gables, swags and cartouches formed from stone, brick and soot-resistant ceramics. Mancunian architecture grew fantasy from the filth of coal-fired wealth. The Tower of Light, white and sparkling, updates this tradition for a low-carbon age. It is essentially a big chimney, but not as LS Lowry would have known it. It’s a dispersion flue, to use the technical term, a 40 metre-high device for extracting fumes from a gas-fired combined heat and power unit beneath it. Its swirling forms resemble those that Antoni Gaudí put on top of Barcelona apartment blocks. They are inspired, say its architects Mike Tonkin and Anna Liu, both by the ornate chimneys on Tudor palaces and by the glass sponge, a submarine organism that is one of David Attenborough’s favourite creatures.  The tower is the most visible manifestation of the Manchester Civic Quarter Heat Network, a £24m project to provide a more sustainable heat and power system to the landmarks such as the city’s town hall, central library and convention centre, and the Bridgewater Hall music venue. Conceived in 2019, the network is not so far advanced as to dispense with fossil fuels altogether, but the city council and its partner Vital Energi say it’s a considerable upgrade on previous arrangements. Renewable power sources, they add, can be plugged into the system at a later date. The tower serves a symbolic as well as a practical function, as a statement of the council’s desire for cleaner energy. As this is, in effect, a small power station near the heart of the city, it was felt that something other than a standard flue tower was desirable. A design competition was held, with the hope of creating some sort of marker to what is considered an important gateway to the city’s centre. Tonkin Liu won the competition with a design that aims to be more than an artistic statement. The outer form of the tower – a vertical steel tube that supports the extract flues inside – puts into practice a concept called the “shell lace structure”, which they have developed with the engineers Arup over the past 12 years. It uses principles derived from nature to make a building as strong as possible with the minimum amount of materials. It’s a rigid object shaped by the flow of forces, by dynamics of rotation that, says Tonkin, are fundamental to natural energy. So the steel skin of the tower is stiffened with corrugations and undulations like those of a sea shell. Its structure, like a glass sponge, is a lattice, which efficiently resists both horizontal and vertical loads. It becomes more open and perforated towards the top, where less strength is needed, which also allows the wind to blow through it more easily. Its shape is an ellipse in plan, with the narrower ends aligned with the prevailing wind, so as to reduce resistance. Its spiralling form helps to break up wind pressures, as similar patterns do on ornate Tudor chimneys. All these features allow the steel sheet from which the tower is made to be an exceptionally thin 6mm. The mathematics of this biologically-inspired engineering also create the filigree form that passersby will notice more than anything else, and which amply fulfils the council’s desire for a landmark. It rises from the Wall of Energy, a curving horizontal base clad in robust ceramic tiles – each one made with the techniques and to the approximate size of a Belfast sink – whose three-dimensional undulations echo those of the tower. A long window allows you to see the workings of the heat and power plant inside. Almost everything on both base and tower is white and curvy, but the lower part is more weighty and earthy, the upper more ethereal. By day, light bounces off it and penetrates through it, and reflects off the stainless steel flues that you can glimpse through the openings. By night it’s illuminated with shifting colours that can be changed to suit an occasion – Pride, for example, or a triumph by the city’s blue or red football teams. Car headlights put the rippling tiles into continuous visual motion. This glistening thing is borderline kitsch – it could be one of those futile objects which, in the name of public art, public authorities sometimes commission – but it is saved from such a fate by the determined thought that went into its engineering. Those shapes are not pure whimsy. It’s a work of skill, both by its architects and engineers and by the Lancastrian businesses, Shawton Engineering and Darwen Terracotta, that made the steelwork and the tiles. The next question is how the principles behind the tower might be applied at a larger scale and in a more everyday way. It stands in an area of Manchester that has been extensively redeveloped, with big blocky developers’ towers standing nearby. These are more conventionally constructed, with rectangular frames and concrete cores. In theory, shell-lace construction, applied to buildings like this, could save many tonnes of steel and concrete. In practice, the approach has a way to go. The companies that build such towers usually like both straight lines and techniques they already know. Rooms, windows and doors tend also to come in right-angled shapes that would have to be reconciled with the curves of a shell-lace structure. One can but dream. Meanwhile, you’d have to have a heart of stone not to enjoy the simple pleasures the Tower of Light offers, and the inspired commitment with which it was designed and built.",Arts/Art and design,"Tower of Light, Manchester review – a work of fantasy and innovation",https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/06/tower-of-light-manchester-review-tonkin-liu-wall-of-energy-a-work-of-fantasy-and-innovation
2/6/2022,"The warm living room of Tété-Michel Kpomassie’s otherwise neat Parisian home has a coffee table in the middle of it piled high with keepsakes – a mountain of black and white pictures, letters and handwritten diaries. It’s an archive of one remarkable man’s intrepidly adventurous and unconventional life to date. Balanced on top of the overloaded files and folders sits a tattered book, its pages faded. On its cover is a portrait of an Inuit in a sealskin jacket, standing next to an icy shore. The title reads Les Esquimaux du Groenland à l’Alaska (The Eskimos from Greenland to Alaska). It’s a 1947 work of nonfiction authored by French anthropologist Robert Gessain. Decades may have passed since the day Kpomassie first set his teenage eyes upon this image in his native Togo, but the 80-year-old remembers the precise moment as if it had happened just minutes before. How could he not? What he found inside has, since that day, consumed him entirely, shaping every chapter of his own story. He ran away from home at 16 to embark on an epic cross-continental mission that delivered him to Greenland, the world’s northernmost country. He was the first African man to set foot there. The adventure resulted in a travelogue, return visits and countless speaking invitations, and, more recently, a rather acrimonious divorce. Now, his very own sealskin jacket hangs by the door to his home in pride of place.  Quite what an academic study of Inuit peoples was doing on the shelves of a small Christian missionary bookshop in 1950s Lomé remains a mystery. Kpomassie stumbled across it while recovering from a tree-top run-in with a snake. The only explanation he can think of, after years of contemplation, is that finding it was his destiny – an undeniable consequence of some predetermined fate. “I picked it up, not understanding the words in front of me,” Kpomassie says, his eyes lighting up as he recounts that morning. “But the man on the cover was smiling right at me. We had a connection, an exchange.” Intrigued, Kpomassie bought the book, sat on the beach and devoured it from cover to cover. Once finished, he read it again and again. “From the minute I completed it,” he says, “I never stopped thinking of Greenland, my country. It was resonating inside me. I don’t understand it. But a magnet was pulling me, so I packed my bags and left, in secret.” The journey which followed is barely believable. If it weren’t for the artefacts laid out in front of me, I might question whether it was a fairytale dreamed up in his mind. It was a trip that saw him traverse Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Mauritania and Senegal. There were brief stops in Morocco and Algeria, before he finally disembarked a boat in the south of France. From there, his voyage through Europe was facilitated by the endless kindnesses of strangers and, in particular, the generosity of Jean Callaut – to whom Kpomassie’s own book is dedicated. Callaut was a Frenchman who soon became an adoptive father to the young traveller so far from home. “When people heard my story,” Kpomassie says, “each was certain they were dealing with someone very determined. But if they hadn’t helped me, be in no doubt, I’d have found another way.” Just before noon on 27 June 1965, the boat Kpomassie had boarded in Copenhagen eight days earlier docked in Qaqortoq, a small town in southern Greenland. Eight years had passed since he’d first said goodbye to Togo. And, finally, Kpomassie – now aged 24 – had arrived in his new home. “It was fantastic,” he says, all smiles. “From the ship’s porthole I could see all the people gathering at the harbour waiting for our boat to arrive.” In the hull were supplies, namely coffee and alcohol, that locals had been waiting all winter for. Little did they know that on board was also a surprise of another kind. “I took my time to step out,” he continues, “uncertain of how people would react to seeing me. I suspected none would have met a black man before. When I did, everyone stopped talking, all were staring. They didn’t know if I was a real person or wearing a mask. Children hid behind their mothers. Some cried, presuming I was a spirit from the mountains.” One woman, he later learned, yelled “handsome” in his direction from the crowd. Of course, the Arctic climate and landscapes he encountered as he moved through the country were total opposites to those of Togo. And he was intrigued by the cultural differences, too. “The way each place treated children struck me early on,” he recalls. “In Togo, kids were treated as the subjects of their elders, with strictly enforced hierarchies. In Greenland, meanwhile, parents obeyed their young.” In the book he later wrote, Kpomassie examines and contrasts the customs of his two homelands, looking at their respective treatment of the elderly, rituals for hunting, prayer and death, as well as familial structures and non-monogamy, which in both places was markedly different from modern European ways. And then there was the food, the intensely spiced dishes he grew up eating were a far cry from the boiled seal he was served up night after night, and raw fish eaten straight from the ocean. In time, however, Kpomassie came to consider the two nations’ similarities which, in his mind, also bound them together. Doing so helped him see his own desire to leave Togo in a different light. “I left because at that time I had been made to hate my culture, because of what was happening in Africa,” he says. When he left Lomé, the country was still under French colonial rule. “Christians tried to convert my father,” he says. “African names were banned and we were forced to take Christian ones before being admitted into schools.” What Greenland promised, Kpomassie hoped, was a life free from this violence, where traditions and customs were left to thrive. “The problem was, I discovered that Greenland was also a colonised country,” he says. “Its culture was already being diluted by European influences. They worshipped their sea god, but here missionaries undermined local beliefs, too.” It was only in the northernmost places he visited that Kpomassie would find the freedom he’d been searching for. If anything, he was disappointed by what he found at first in the south. “There were no igloos, no hunters or huskies,” he says. “Everyone was always drinking beer and coffee, and buying Danish food from the department store. After eight years of travel and thousands of kilometres, it dawned on me that arriving in Greenland was only the start of my journey. Because when I asked my hosts where the Inuit igloos and seal-hunters were, I was told to go to the far north.” It was only up there, as autumn and then winter settled in, when the country and its people were plunged into a seemingly endless polar night, that Kpomassie felt he’d truly arrived. “When the first snow falls,” he says, “You see the real Greenland. With the temperature dropping rapidly and, the sea freezing up, that’s when Greenlanders become the kings of their country. Outsiders vanish, age-old knowledge prevails. It’s that liberation I loved the most.” Under the aurora borealis, as far from Africa as he’d ever been, Kpomassie at last found his light. Today, Kpomassie lives in Nanterre, a historic suburb to the west of Paris. Despite being more than 50 years his junior, I struggle to keep up, with both pace and conversation, as we make our way to a nearby restaurant for lunch. As it transpired, Kpomassie tells me, his first pilgrimage to Greenland wasn’t permanent. Only 18 months after arriving, he reluctantly returned to Togo, to share his stories with his compatriots and the family who’d long presumed him dead. “At first,” he says, scanning the wine list, “when I came back from Greenland, I wanted to throw my diary into the sea. I did not want to write a book.” His experiences felt private, almost sacred. “In fact, I didn’t even want to leave, but I couldn’t get the right boat at the right time to head further north. So I toured 16 African nations giving talks. I wrote the book. I somehow got married in France and had two children. But all the while I knew where I ultimately needed to end up.” More than 40 years have passed since his book was first published in French. Since then, there have been a further 22 editions in 10 languages. A new English one arrives this year, with Portuguese and Mandarin versions in the works, too. No doubt its longevity can be attributed to Kpomassie’s skilful storytelling, but it’s by no means the only reason his work has stood the test of time. While many similar travelogues from decades past, written by “explorers”, now feel dated – Eurocentric, patronising or exoticising of their subjects – Kpomassie’s couldn’t be more relevant. The kinship he felt with Inuits on that first visit saw the publication of a literary work that was well ahead of its time. Since then, Kpomassie has returned a further three times to Greenland, his most recent visit as a lecturer with a Norwegian cruise liner back in 2007. This September he’ll make one final journey to his adoptive nation, where, at 81, he intends to live out his remaining years. Through all the decades since, this has been his plan, he says. Unfortunately, that’s why last year he and his wife of 46 years – the mother of his children – divorced, going their separate ways. “I was married for a long time, but sadly our separation became inevitable,” he says. “She knew from the beginning that Greenland is the most important thing in my life.” The deal, he says, was always that they’d one day swap their comfortable life in France for a retirement spent hunting in the shadow of Greenland’s mountains. At some stage, Kpomassie’s ex-wife – now a grandmother – not unsurprisingly, changed her mind. It created an irreconcilable gap. “Now, she wants to spend her retirement visiting Rome, Florence, Venice,” he says, a little indignant. “From the offset I was honest about where my heart was. We’d always agreed to go together. I understand, of course, that her wishes changed. But mine haven’t.” And what do his children make of it all? Well, they’re not hugely impressed. Kpomassie thinks his big mistake was telling them his intentions in the first place. “If I’d told my family as a 16-year-old, I would never have left Togo,” he says. “Everyone would have tried to reason with me, to stop me. Now my sons are doing the same, but that’s not what I want. My children admire me, but they are afraid, and they feel they should discourage me.” He’ll miss them, he says, but his door will always be open should they wish to come and visit. On arrival in Greenland, Kpomassie hopes to spend a year travelling the country, giving talks to schoolchildren about his adventures in their country and across Africa. Then he’ll head north, where he’ll stay for good. “I’ll have a dog sled and huskies,” he grins. “I’ll find myself a small fishing boat. And here I’ll happily spend my remaining days, and finally find time to write my second book, about my childhood in Africa.” That is, of course, if the authorities allow it. At present, aside from locals, only Danish people are allowed to buy property in Greenland. “I think they might make an exception for me,” he says, winking. “Well, at least I hope so.” He wants to be buried at the foot of an iceberg. “In African animism, we believe in spirits in trees, the sea and mountains,” he continues. “Greenlanders also believe icebergs have a soul. Sitting and staring at the icebergs I can converse with these spirits. I find my ancestors in Africa, but I find them in Greenland more.” Coping without life’s luxuries will be no trouble, Kpomassie assures me, as a waiter delivers him a plate of duck breast and refills our glasses with Côte du Rhône. “All this? It’s superficial,” he says. “The day I put on my sealskin anorak hanging in my hallway, I’ll forget it all and say goodbye. It’s just to survive, I’ve had to adapt. When you pursue a dream,” he continues, eyes twinkling, “one which has grown with you for an entire lifetime, you live and breathe it. It’s inside me. Fulfilling it is not a choice. Anyone would have said my first journey there would be impossible, but I proved them wrong. Why should it be any different this time just because I’m older? It’s my destiny.

2/6/2022,"Mountains have been firing the imaginations of writers and adventurers for centuries, and Anna Fleming’s debut is the latest addition to a long tradition of literary reflections that includes Nan Shepherd’s The Living Mountain and Robert Macfarlane’s Mountains of the Mind, both of which have clearly influenced Fleming’s writing. There has been a vogue in recent years for memoirs by women seeking to immerse themselves in the natural world as a means of overcoming some deep trauma: divorce, addiction, the death of a parent. Fleming’s book has no such heroine’s journey at its heart; she just loves climbing. At one point she mentions the end of a relationship driving her to a more intense focus on her craft, but skates quickly across the surface of her feelings: “Some people turn to drink, I relaxed on the rock.”  While in some ways this is refreshing – male writers rarely frame stories of physical challenge in terms of psychic “healing” – the lack of an overarching narrative means that Fleming’s book can feel a little repetitive. No doubt fellow enthusiasts will revel in the intricate account of each ascent, but the non-specialist may feel it’s weighted too heavily towards the technical detail. I’d have liked to hear more, for example, about the pioneering female climbers she mentions in passing, or to read in greater depth about the psychology of risk, and how the experience of challenging herself on the rock face translated into the rest of her life. That said, she writes beautifully about landscape, and her passion for these ancient formations is physical and poetic; she presents climbing as a form of partner dance. “And within that absorbing outdoor ballet – when stretching and balancing, reaching and releasing – you come to see things differently.”  Time on Rock: A Climber’s Route Into the Mountains by Anna Fleming is published by Canongate (£16.99).

2/6/2022,"There’s a war happening right now. No, it’s not in Ukraine (at least not yet). It’s on Main Street. In Manhattan, where the New York police department reports shoplifting levels not seen in nearly 30 years, a Rite-Aid store announces it’s closing because of theft losses. Small retailers in New York have given their district attorney an earful. Residents and shop owners in San Francisco say that crime there has “spun out of control”. Chicago has been the target of “rampant” shoplifting incidents. Reports of “flash” shoplifting gangs have prompted legislators to introduce bills to protect businesses as far apart as Kenosha, Wisconsin, and Washington state.  Is this real or moral panic? Some columnists, such as Amanda Mull from the Atlantic, says that the “the deeper you search for real, objective evidence of an accelerating retail crime wave, the more difficult it is to be sure that you know anything at all”. The Los Angeles police department recently announced that robbery, burglary and theft are actually down in the city compared with 2019. An activist group in Seattle says that in some cases shoplifting is “justified”. One retail association says that retail theft would be less if Amazon and Facebook didn’t make it so easy to sell stolen goods. When you ask retailers, they’ll tell you that shoplifting is a big and growing problem. Just ask the National Retail Federation. Half of the respondents in that organization’s 2021 retail security survey said they saw an increase in shoplifting this past year. According to the report, theft and fraud cost retailers $62bn in 2020 and the average retail robbery netted more than $7,500 in product – a figure not seen since 2015. More disturbingly, about 69% of retailers said they have also experienced a significant increase in “organized retail crime” activity – thefts involving groups of people – over the past year. The reasons cited included the pandemic, lapse in policing and apprehension, changes to sentencing guidelines and the growth of online marketplaces like Facebook and Amazon. Whatever the reasons, “inventory shrink” (retailer politesse for shoplifting) is above its five-year average and shoplifters are clearly striking quite a blow in their war with retailers. So how are merchants fighting back? Unfortunately, they’re having to spend. Many of my shop-owner clients are taking the obvious internal steps. These would include making sure their stores are organized and tidy, that their employees are trained to be on alert for typical shoplifting tactics, and that mirrors are added to avoid blind spots among updated and prominent signs that warn of prosecution. A handful have hired security guards. Those with very high-dollar inventory (jewelry, say) are taking more steps to secure these products or removing them from their stores each night. Others are installing more protective glass on their exterior windows and display cases. Many others are investing in new security systems or re-designing themselves to thwart shoplifting. A Safeway store in San Francisco, for example, has added automatic gates that immediately swing shut behind entering customers in order to prevent thieves from running out of the store with full shopping carts. Other retailers are setting up coiled wire or putting more of their items under lock and key. The National Association of Shoplifting Prevention takes a different approach by offering retailers the opportunity to participate in “progressive shoplifting prevention” that includes encouraging “a shift in focus to long-term education and awareness solutions, rather than continuing to invest solely in physical prevention and apprehension” by making investments to “reduce recidivism to break the cycle and cure the shoplifting problem rather than continually spending money to repeatedly treat its symptoms”. Or you could do what one small merchant in Denver is doing: charge all customers an additional 1% fee on top of everything else to cover his shoplifting losses. Calling it the “Denver crime spike fee”, the owner says it helps him to recover thousands of dollars in losses. “We’re talking about six figures [in losses] for a really small business like us, and that is meaningful,” he told the Denver Business Journal. “It impacts our employees, and, more importantly, it now is going to impact our shoppers.” Maybe that’s what it takes to win the shoplifting war? I really hope not.",News/Business,US store owners are worried about shoplifting – what can be done?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/06/shoplifting-store-owners-small-businesses-gene-marks
2/6/2022,"Boris Johnson must stay in place to deal with the “hugely damaging” No 10 parties scandal and the cost of living crisis because they are his responsibility to fix, according to the former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith. The Conservative grandee said he wanted cabinet ministers to “temper their ambitions” and allow Johnson the time to sort out “the big, big crises that are hitting the government”.  He said a leadership contest would be destabilising at the moment. But asked whether it was possible to recover the reputation of the party with Boris Johnson remaining as prime minister, he told the BBC’s Sunday Morning programme: “None of us know the answer to that question ... Respect and trust you have to earn, and when you lose it, it’s a very difficult task to get it back across the board. “And so that’s going to be a huge task. The government and the prime minister have set out to try and do that.” Duncan Smith’s remarks came after a disastrous week for Johnson in which he lost five senior staff members and a string of MPs declared they had lost confidence in him. Some MPs believe a vote of no confidence in the prime minister is likely in the coming week and Charles Walker, a former vice-chair of the 1922 Committee, told the Observer that Johnson’s removal was “inevitable”. Around 15 Tory MPs have publicly called on the prime minister to resign, including most recently the former minister Nick Gibb. This weekend, Johnson overhauled his operation, appointing the Cabinet Office minister, Steve Barclay, as his chief of staff, while Guto Harri, a former aide of Johnson’s, becomes his new director of communications. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, spoke to several broadcasters in support of the prime minister of Sunday, attempting to draw a line under the scandal by saying “the ongoing focus on partygate is not helping anyone”. He also called for Tory MPs to give Johnson “the time and space to deliver on his mandate”. Kwarteng also claimed it had been legitimate for Johnson to throw a slur at Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer in the House of Commons by claiming that Starmer, when he was director of public prosecutions, presided over the failure to prosecute the serial child abuser Jimmy Savile. Two other cabinet ministers, Rishi Sunak and Sajid Javid, have said they would not have made such a comment, which led to the resignation last week of Munira Mirza, Johnson’s longstanding policy chief. There has already been some scepticism about the Johnson’s operational shake-up, which will involve creating a new office of the prime minister and potentially centralising more power into No 10. Gavin Barwell, a former chief of staff for Theresa May, told Sky’s Trevor Phillips On Sunday that Barclay would have a huge brief. He added: “And then the second challenge, and I think probably the key one, is whether the prime minister is going to listen to the good advice that he will give. “There’s only so much difference advisers can make if the person at the top is not actually listening to the advice that we’re giving.”",News/Politics,"Give Boris Johnson time to fix his crises, says Iain Duncan Smith",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/06/give-boris-johnson-time-to-fix-his-crises-says-iain-duncan-smith
2/6/2022,"Ifind myself increasingly wearied by the language of our weather forecasters - dribs and drabs, spits and spots, mist and murk - and long for something more dramatic. So God bless the BBC for the following headline from last weekend: “US east coast hunkers down as ‘bombogenesis’ snowstorm hits.” The report went on to explain this apocalyptic-sounding event thus: “Experts say the storm will undergo bombogenesis, meaning that colder air is expected to mix with warmer sea air, leading to a swift drop in atmospheric pressure. The process leads to a so-called bomb cyclone.” That’s more like it.  As if that wasn’t enough, there was a report of a record lightning bolt, also in the US, which stretched nearly 500 miles and has been named a “megaflash” and lit up the skies of Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi in April 2020, according to the World Meteorological Organization. The previous best was a measly 440-mile flash in Brazil. OK, I know that we don’t have such dramatic extremes in this country, but I fear that spits and spots will never cut the mustard again. Marvellous what tripe ends up in my inbox. Consider this: “I wanted to reach out on behalf of our R.Agency client, what3words, the location tech app which has recently officially launched in 50 languages.

2/6/2022,"It is proving to be one of the essential plays of the past 20 years. In 2002, A Number carried a special, current thrill, tapping into debates about cloning. On an almost bare, tousled stage a baleful Michael Gambon confronted three versions of his son, all played by a clenched Daniel Craig. Is one of these more “real” than the others? Questions raised in Caryl Churchill’s drama continue to matter long after Dolly the sheep has ceased to bleat. What counts more, inheritance or upbringing? How do we recognise another individual? Why do we think of ourselves as being singular? This is the fifth production I have seen: each has glinted with different alarms, jokes and sorrows. Directed by Lyndsey Turner, ignited by magnificent performances from Paapa Essiedu and Lennie James, it has a new luminosity.  Turner’s production is beautifully rounded – and spiky. Every aspect presses on Churchill’s themes. Arvo Pärt’s Fratres, an insistent set of variations, is woven between scenes. Es Devlin’s design (Adele’s loss is the theatre’s gain) is sturdily naturalistic but is all-over apricot-coloured as if made of overheated plastic, questionably solid. Essiedu and James set up a terrific dynamic, playing the dialogue less posh than usual, so that questions of money and menace seem particularly immediate; at moments there is a Pinter gangster tang – alongside good domestic detail to do with the casual shucking off and the busybody picking-up of trainers. Both actors have been missing from the stage while lighting up the telly: the stage has missed them. James, who has to remain recognisably the same person while slowly disclosing information that makes an audience see him differently, shifts subtly between caginess, wiliness, regret – suggesting that damage is its own inheritance. Essiedu’s task is the opposite: to create three separate characters from the same material. He is a marvel, twisting from dishevelled anxiety to thuggish rage; pronouncing “Daddy” as if it were the most desperate of words; finally conjuring up an American sunniness which beams from every atom before he has even opened his mouth. He makes you want to see him in everything. At one point he stretches out his hands and stares at them as if they were foreign to him – and strangers to each other. In that gesture he goes to the heart of this extraordinary play. Like Churchill, Alistair McDowall belongs to that small group: the dystopian dramatists. He proved a master of the form in Pomona, first seen at the tiny Orange Tree theatre in 2014, which took off from a hole in the middle of Manchester to explore wild realms of wit and savagery. His new play, The Glow, is more noisily ambitious. It judders between 1863, AD343, 1348 and 1993; its cast includes a Roman soldier, a phoney spiritualist medium, a medieval knight, a woman grieving for her dead son, a scholar researching folklore – and a time-travelling visionary. A rather brilliant cod-academic essay attached to the play text constructs an entire pseudo-academic background, with an invented core text and a thesis about an immortal woman: this is at least as lively as a lot of authentic academic lectures in theatre programmes. It’s a pity there is not more such precise invention in the play itself: a final speech bellows with vapid approximations about apocalypse, with “thunderous force”, “bloated, swelling forms”, “drifting about the void”. Vicky Featherstone’s production is fast, and full of talent. Space and time are sliced and expanded by Jessica Hung Han Yun’s fine lighting design and by Tal Rosner’s transforming videos, which splash and swarm against the walls, stippling them with forest branches or slapping down, as if on a slide morphing under a microscope, what could be a section of an organ or a volcano. Multitasking, Fisayo Akinade brings his particular intelligence and comic gleam to several characters; Rakie Ayola is spiny and focused; Ria Zmitrowicz is explosive, arresting. Yet there is too much windy writing for the play to sear. It is a series of fiery moments, sometimes glowing, but also guttering.
