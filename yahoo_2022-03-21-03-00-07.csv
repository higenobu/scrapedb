3/21/2022,"The stalled and sputtering spectacle the Russian military is making of itself in Ukraine came as a revelation to General Frank McKenzie – and almost certainly to Vladimir Putin as well. ""I am surprised at the problems they were having,"" McKenzie said. ""It should be very concerning to Russian leadership."" As commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East, McKenzie has spent the last three years operating in close proximity to the Russians in Syria, and knows their history as one of the world's great tank armies – all of which has been belied by the first three weeks of war. ""They haven't been able to maneuver their armor effectively,"" McKenzie told CBS News national security correspondent David Martin. ""There's a tremendous history of that, actually, in the Russian military, being able to do deep-armored operations. At the end of the Second World War, they were as good at that as anybody else. But these guys don't seem to have remembered that."" ""Should heads roll?"" Martin asked. ""I would not be happy if that's the way U.S. forces were performing,"" McKenzie replied. ""We have non-commissioned officers that are the backbone of the joint force. They're the people that actually make sure things are done, that continuing actions are taken, that you dig in, that your tanks don't run out of fuel."" McKenzie, himself a tank commander as a young officer, watched in disbelief as an entire armored column advancing on Kyiv literally ran out of gas. ""If you're going to drive and operate a main battle tank as a commander, and I have, then you are thinking all the time about fueling that beast. If you're not thinking about fueling that beast, then you're behind. And they appear to have not taken those basic logistical considerations and trying as they move forward."" Martin asked, ""Are you surprised they seem to be sticking to the roads?"" ""That's a lack of training,"" he said. ""You've got to get off the roads to maneuver. The roads are death traps, particularly for armored vehicles, particularly when you're fighting people that have good anti-tank systems, and the Ukrainians do have good anti-tank systems."" On Wednesday President Biden promised the U.S. will send 9,000 more anti-tank weapons. ""The United States and our allies and partners are fully committed to surging weapons of assistance to the Ukrainians,"" he said, ""and more will be coming."" Including the shoulder-fired Javelin, which dives down on the top of a tank where the armor is thinnest. Using everything from the high-end Javelin to the workaday rocket-propelled grenade launcher, the Ukrainians have destroyed several hundred Russian vehicles. Anti-tank missile ""Javelin"" thwarts Russian attacks in UkraineThe weapons the U.S. and allies are providing to Ukraine Martin asked, ""How much of this is due to Russian incompetence as opposed to Ukrainian skill?"" ""That's a great question, and I think we're going to have to see how this progresses a little further to be able to finally answer that question. I would say this: the Ukrainians have shown great bravery in defending their country. It's less clear to me how aggressive and motivated Russian forces are down at the individual soldier level, the platoons that are actually driving on the roads, you know, meeting the enemy."" Ukrainian resistance foiled Russia's plan to take the capital of Kyiv with a lightning strike in the opening days of the war. With their vaunted tank army stalled, the Russians have reverted to siege tactics – pounding cities and their residents with rockets and artillery. But they are expected to regroup and try again.

""I would be surprised if that outcome happened,"" McKenzie replied. ""Taking Kyiv is very important to them. I predict they'll try very hard to take it, and I think there could be a horrific price, actually, to be paid in the civilian population as they move against the city.""

3/21/2022,"An elite Ukrainian drone unit has been striking Russian targets with anti-tank grenades while troops sleep. The drone unit has destroyed dozens of ""priority targets"" including Russian tanks, command trucks and other vehicles. Ukrainian forces have had surprising success in using drones to destroy Russian equipment. An elite Ukrainian drone unit is destroying the weaponry of the invading Russian forces as their soldiers' sleep, The Times of London reported. Aerorozvidka, a specialist air reconnaissance unit within the army, says it has destroyed dozens of ""priority targets"" including Russian tanks, command trucks, and other vehicles in nighttime raids, the paper reported. Russian forces stop moving during the night and typically hide their tanks in between houses in villages where conventional artillery cannot strike them, Yaroslav Honchar, the unit commander based in Kyiv, told the paper. But the elite drone unit, which has dozens of squads of expert drone pilots, has these stationary vehicles in its cross-hairs. ""We strike at night, when Russians sleep,"" Honchar told the paper. ""In the night it's impossible to see our drones."" ""We look specifically for the most valuable truck in the convoy and then we hit it precisely and we can do it really well with very low collateral damage. Even in the villages, it's possible. You can get much closer at night,"" he said. The unit's arsenal of drones ranges from cheap commercial ones to heavy-duty octocopters that have been modified to drop anti-tank grenades and to see with thermal cameras, according to the paper. The R18 drone has a 4km range and capacity to drop 5kg bombs is particularly prized by Honchar's drone warriors, the paper said. The team also uses PD-1, or Punisher drone, developed by Ukraine, that can carry 3kg of explosives and hit targets up to 30 miles. Since Russia began its invasion, Ukrainian forces have had success in using drones such as the highly-rated Turkish-made Bayraktar TB-2 to destroy the equipment of invading forces, Justin Bronk, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) wrote in The Spectator. The success of the drones ""speaks more to the skill of its Ukrainian operators and the incompetence and operational failures of Russian forces,"" Bronk wrote. Aerorozvidka's drone unit, which flys up to 300 missions a day, according to The Times, operates using Elon Musk's Starlink satellite system, which was activated in Ukraine days after Russia invaded. This means drone teams can operate regardless of internet or power outages, which are currently rampant across the country. ""If we use a drone with thermal vision at night, the drone must connect through Starlink to the artillery guy and create target acquisition,"" an Aerorozvidka leader told The Times. Aerorozvidka uses an advanced Nato-supported intelligence system, Delta, which pulls together information from various sources including satellites and drone reconnaissance to precisely identify targets. This helps the unit make the most efficient use of their limited supply of bombs, according to The Times. Aerorozvidka was created by model plane enthusiasts in 2014 and has since been integrated into the Ukrainian general staff following the success of its operations against Russian forces in Crimea, The Times said. In recent weeks, supporters from around Europe have been donating drone parts and other equipment such as 3D printers to help build and repair devices damaged by Russian rifles.

3/21/2022,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday that neither he nor his people can accept some of Russia's reported demands for ending its increasingly brutal invasion, which is now entering its fourth week. Notably, Zelensky said, Ukraine would not be giving any territorial concessions to Russia. ""There are compromises for which we cannot be ready as an independent state,"" he told CNN host Fareed Zakaria, speaking through an interpreter. ""Any compromises related to our territorial integrity and our sovereignty .... [the] Ukrainian people have spoken about it. They have not greeted Russian soldiers with a bunch of flowers; they have greeted them with bravery, and they have greeted them with weapons in their hands."" Zelensky added: “You cannot curry favor with the citizens of another country forcibly.” According to Turkey's government, which has strong relations with both Ukraine and Russia, Russian President Vladimir Putin recently outlined a series of terms for ending his attack. The most challenging of those terms relate to Ukrainian territory. BBC News, which reported on Turke’s phone call with Putin, wrote, ""The assumption is that Russia will demand that the Ukrainian government should give up territory in eastern Ukraine."" Russia has for years backed an armed rebellion in eastern Ukraine, and before the invasion it formally recognized two breakaway republics there along the Russian border. In 2014, Russia also invaded and annexed the Crimean peninsula, which was previously controlled by Ukraine. Much of the world — including Ukraine, the U.S. and most of Europe — refused to recognize the territory as part of Russia. The Kremlin is likely seeking this recognition as part of the peace terms as well. On Sunday, Zelensky said as both a president and citizen of Ukraine, these types of terms are a nonstarter. ""You cannot just demand from Ukraine to recognize some territories as independent republics. These compromises are simply wrong,"" he said. Russia's other demands may be easier for Ukraine to entertain, such as Kyiv vowing to never join the NATO military alliance. Both Zelensky and prior Ukrainian administrations have long requested membership in NATO, which carries with it a mutual-defense pact in case of an attack. NATO has quietly rebuffed Ukraine’s request, fearing antagonizing Russia and triggering a global war. “If we were a NATO member, a war wouldn't have started. I'd like to receive security guarantees for my country, for my people,” Zelensky said, calling for the Western military alliance to finally give Ukraine clarity on its membership ask. “If NATO members are ready to see us in the alliance, then do it immediately because people are dying on a daily basis.” Zelensky also repeated his call for Putin to meet with him directly to hammer out a peace accord. The Kremlin has not appeared eager for such a meeting to take place, arguing that the terms of the ceasefire need to be ironed out in advance. ""I think that without negotiations, we cannot end this war. I think that all of the people who think that this dialogue is shallow and that it is not going to resolve anything, they just don't understand that this is very valuable. If there is just a 1% chance for us to stop this war, I think that we need to take this chance. We need to do that.""",World/Yahoo News,Zelensky draws line in negotiations: We're not giving land to Russia,https://news.yahoo.com/volodymyr-zelensky-fareed-zakaria-cnn-ukraine-165552475.html

 Intercept reporter Mara Hvistendahl said reports that the National Institute of Health may have funded a grant for research that resulted in the release of COVID-19 from a lab are ""dangerous."" ""There is absolutely no evidence to support that so I consider that a conspiracy theory,"" Hvistendahl said on HillTV's Rising. This comes after Hvistendahl and Intercept reporter Sharon Lerner reported that Peter Daszak, who works for EcoHealth Alliance, which aims to understand and prevent infectious diseases, worked closely with the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a partner on a 2014 NIH grant to research bat coronaviruses in China. Daszak has also been tied to many debates about the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic because of a research proposal that reportedly risked creating a more dangerous pathogen. ""As Dasack said again and again to us it was not funded. Nonetheless as far as I knew he has not gone on the record talking about this grant until our interview,"" she said. ""Many people are concerned about that particular proposal and we are in an unusual situation where you have a group of internet sleuths who release a document that initially was not verified by other people apart from Project Veritas,"" she added. Project Veritas, a far right media company, has been criticized for its reporting that the NIH funded a grant into research into bat related coronavirus may have led to the pandemic, with Dr. Anthony Fauci calling the reporting, ""distorted."" Hvistendahl said Daszak maintain that research that could make coronavirus more transmissible was not funded.

3/21/2022,"(Reuters) - Ukraine's defence ministry said late on Friday it lost access to the Sea of Azov ""temporarily"" as invading Russian forces were tightening their grip around the Sea's major port of Mariupol. ""The occupiers have partially succeeded in the Donetsk operational district, temporarily depriving Ukraine of access to the Sea of Azov,"" Ukraine's defence ministry said in a statement. The ministry did not specify in its statement whether Ukraine's forces have regained access to the Sea. Russia said on Friday its forces were ""tightening the noose"" around Mariupol, where an estimated 80% of the city's homes had been damaged more some 1,000 people may still be trapped in makeshift bomb shelters beneath a destroyed theatre.. Mariupol, with its strategic location on the coast of the Sea of Azov, has been a target since the start of the war on Feb. 24 when Russian President Vladimir Putin launched what he called a ""special military operation"". The city lies on the route between the Russian-annexed peninsula of Crimea to the west, and the Donetsk region to the east, which is partially controlled by pro-Russian separatists. Russia claimed as early as March 1 that its forces had cut off the Ukrainian military from the Sea of Azov.

3/21/2022,"Zelenskyy said an ""incompetent"" Russian military was leading to ""unprecedented losses."" He has said some 14,000 Russian soldiers have died, while Western estimates are closer to 7,000. Zelenskyy added that some Russian combat units were destroyed ""by 80-90%"" during the fighting. In a stark message Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said some areas of combat have been ""simply piled with corpses of Russian soldiers."" The Ukrainian president said that his forces continue to deter Russian forces and ""inflict unprecedented losses on Russian troops."" He added that the Russian military has proven itself ""incompetent, capable of simply driving their people to slaughter."" ""Some units of the occupiers were destroyed by 80-90%,"" Zelenskyy said on Telegram. ""In places of especially fierce battles, the frontline of our defense is simply piled with the corpses of Russian soldiers."" ""And these corpses, these bodies, are not taken away,"" he added. ""New units are driven on the offensive through these bodies. Some reserves that the command of the Russian troops collect wherever they can."" Zelenskyy has said over 14,000 Russian soldiers have died thus far. US intelligence estimated last week that 7,000 of the 150,000 Russian troops involved in the war have died. ""We are well aware that Russia has just a bottomless human resource and a lot of equipment, missiles, and bombs. But I want to ask the citizens of Russia. What have they done to you over the years that you stopped noticing your losses?"" Zelenskyy said. ""This is 14,000 mothers, 14,000 fathers. These are wives, these are children, relatives, and friends. And you don't notice it?"" He warned there would ""only be more victims"" as Russia's war against Ukraine continues. Zelenskyy has called for peace talks with Russia multiple times in the last several weeks, warning that Russia will otherwise incur losses that will take ""several generations to recover"" from. During an interview with CNN on Sunday, Zelenskyy said he is ready for negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but he warned that if those talks failed, it ""would mean that this is a third World War,"" Insider's John Dorman reported. ""Ukraine has always sought a peaceful solution,"" Zelenskyy said on Telegram. ""Because we count everyone killed, because every ruined family, every ruined house matters to us. Because were are Ukrainians, and for us, a person is priceless.""
