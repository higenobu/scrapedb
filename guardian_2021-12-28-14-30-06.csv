12/28/2021,"Queues of up to eight hours for PCR testing in New South Wales have led to calls to standardise interstate testing requirements and make rapid antigen tests the norm. The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, blamed interstate travel requirements for a significant increase in demand on an already overwhelmed system and the lengthy delays.  Hazzard accused the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, of “passive-aggressive stupidity” over the issue. Wait times had blown out to the point the test results were no longer relevant, Hazzard said on Tuesday. “It is taking up to four days, sometimes five days, to get test results. “They might have been negative on day one when they had their test, but they could well be positive on day four or day five when they cross the border. “So on all fronts, there is no logic in continuing (this).” Testing delays in NSW, Victoria and the ACT were expected to continue until at least New Year’s Eve. Melbourne resident ​​Gabriela, who did not want her last name used, said she waited six hours for a test on Tuesday morning. “They were supposed to open the testing site at nine so I got there 7.15. As I was in line, one nurse came out at 8.10 and put a line suspended poster 100 metres behind me,” she told Guardian Australia. Gabriela said there was a woman in line standing up and breastfeeding as they waited for their tests. “There were two women in the line who told her they would keep her place if she wanted to sit down and breastfeed. “There were a couple of people with kids, they were well behaved, they all deserve gold stars, but it feels so unnecessary at this point. “Is this working for anyone?” Been waiting 2 hours for PCR. Line still blocks long. Niece who has fever and vomiting went to a different testing site and was too sick to wait to get swabbed. This isn’t working.Palaszczuk needs to show some empathy and change her travel test rules. Gabriela said the people around her in the line did not have symptoms, and most were having tests so they could travel. “We’ve got rapid antigen tests, we need to start using them. I have one at home, I could have easily done one.” In NSW, Dr Effie Karageorgos said she had encountered testing lines several kilometres long. “In Sydney right now – testing lines are kms long and there isn’t a rapid antigen test to be found in chemists and other stores (have been driving around and calling trying to find some this morning for my parents in case they need),” she tweeted. In Victoria, at least one resident, who did not want to be named, chose to ignore the mandatory isolation over Christmas after waiting four days to get her test result back. “On Wednesday night I found out a colleague had Covid, so everyone who worked with her had to get a test,” she said. The couple waited four days to receive their negative results. After talking to their family, they decided to go to her parent’s house for Christmas. “The rapid test should be free and we should be able to do that if we have no symptoms,” she said. Prof Adrian Esterman from the University of South Australia said the long lines created problems. “We’re getting a lot of people infectious in the community because they’re not willing to wait,” Esterman said. “The second issue is that all of our modelling assumes testing and contact tracing are working well, and they’re not. “So our modelling isn’t accurate and we are getting far more cases than we expected.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning On Sunday the South Australian government moved to rapid antigen testing for interstate travellers, but the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, was standing firm, saying the PCR testing requirement would not be reconsidered until 1 January. Esterman said all interstate travel should require a rapid antigen test instead of a PCR, to release some pressure from the system. The chaos had resulted in calls to disregard testing altogether, especially after Hazzard said on Sunday that everyone in the state “at some point will get Omicron”. But Esterman said that was “a gross exaggeration” and to save lives the testing system, especially for healthcare workers and those people who were symptomatic, still needed to be in place. “The reason why we still need it is to say if people are infected. The rapid antigen test is good, just not as accurate – you have to have the right tool for the right job,” Esterman said. “If you’ve got an aged care worker and they’ve got symptoms you want to know for sure if they’re infected or not. The PCR is test is by far the best way in certain situations.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app A NSW Health spokesperson said it was constantly monitoring demand for testing alongside private testing labs. “Testing capacity in NSW is currently under enormous pressure … NSW has requested that the requirements for PCR testing by other states be terminated and, where necessary, substituted by a rapid antigen test.” Hazzard said rapid antigen tests were “absolutely” the way forward in the pandemic. “We need to look seriously, very seriously, at all these pressures on PCR testing,” he said. “NSW by far does the most PCR testing in the country … two years ago we thought we were doing well when we were doing 40,000 tests a day.” The state has been averaging 132,240 Covid tests a day in the past week, peaking at 164,144 on Christmas Eve. At the same time, the test positivity rate has risen beyond 6%. Prior to Omicron, NSW was also averaging about 130,000 tests a day in September, during the Delta wave of the virus when the positivity rate hovered at about 1%. Testing peaked at 173,913 tests at the beginning of the month. At the end of August, the state was recording an average in excess of 140,000 Covid tests on some days. Private testing clinics were seeing similar pressures with wait times in excess of 100 hours in some instances. An automated voice message on 4Cyte’s Covid hotline was asking patients to hang up and call back later if they had waited less than 72 hours for a test result, while Histopath’s contact line automatically terminated calls due to “unprecedented volumes”. Laverty’s contact number connected patients with a recorded message – “Due to unprecedented demand NSW Health says not to call for test results until after 72 hours” – and then hung up automatically. All three clinics were approached for comment.

12/28/2021,"With his narrow chin, small nose and curly hair he physically resembles his father, said radiologist Sahar Saleem. Perhaps surprisingly for someone who lived about 3,500 years ago, he also has strikingly good teeth. Saleem is talking about the mummified body of the pharaoh Amenhotep I, a warrior king who has been something of an enigma in that he is one of the few royal mummies not to be unwrapped in modern times.  Until now, that is. Saleem, a professor of radiology at the faculty of medicine at Cairo University, is part of a team which has successfully unwrapped Amenhotep I not physically but digitally. The results, using 3D computed tomography (CT) scanning technology, are unprecedented and fascinating. They provide details about his appearance and the lavishness of the jewellery he was buried with. “We show that Amenhotep I was approximately 35 years old when he died,” Saleem said. “He was approximately 169cm tall [5ft 6in], circumcised, and had good teeth. Within his wrappings, he wore 30 amulets and a unique golden girdle with gold beads. “Amenhotep I seems to have physically resembled his father … he had a narrow chin, a small narrow nose, curly hair, and mildly protruding upper teeth.” Saleem is lead author of a study published on Tuesday in the journal Frontiers in Medicine. She said the fact his teeth were so good was testament to how “amazing” the mummification process was. “Mummified bodies were well preserved. Even the tiny bones inside the ears were preserved. No doubt Amenhotep’s teeth were well-preserved. Many royal mummies had bad teeth, but Amenhotep I had good teeth.” Amenhotep I was the second king of the 18th dynasty and ascended to the throne after the death of his father, Ahmose I. He ruled Egypt for about 21 years between roughly 1525 and 1504BC. His name means “Amun is satisfied”. His throne name was Djeserkare – “Holy is the Soul of Re” – and he is seen as having a peaceful reign which allowed him time to concentrate on administrative organisation and the building of temples. He may have co-reigned with his mother, Ahmose-Nefertari. Egyptologists know from decoded hieroglyphics that Amenhotep was unwrapped by priests in the 11th century BC – during the 21st dynasty – in order to repair damage done by tomb robbers. It had also been speculated that they unwrapped him in order to reuse royal burial equipment or steal ornaments. Saleem said their findings debunked those theories and showed the priests had the best of intentions. The original tomb of Amenhotep I has never been found. He was discovered in 1881 at a site in Luxor where it is known officials of the 21st dynasty hid the mummies of kings and nobles in order to protect them from tomb robbers. His home is the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. He has not been unwrapped because of the “perfect” linen wrappings covered by garlands of delphiniums, Egyptian riverhemp and safflowers, and the beauty of his painted burial mask. When the coffin was first opened a preserved wasp was found, probably attracted by the smell of the garlands. The research team has discovered Amenhotep’s brain is intact, unlike other kings including Tutankhamun and Ramses II. Saleem said the project had been an exciting one, “like unwrapping a gift”. The team had been hoping to find evidence of how Amenhotep died but that has proved elusive. “We couldn’t find any wounds or disfigurement due to disease to justify the cause of death, except numerous mutilations postmortem, presumably by grave robbers after his first burial,” said Saleem. “His entrails had been removed by the first mummifiers, but not his brain or heart. “We show that at least for Amenhotep I, the priests of the 21st dynasty lovingly repaired the injuries inflicted by the tomb robbers, restored his mummy to its former glory, and preserved the magnificent jewellery and amulets in place.”",News/Science,"Egyptian pharaoh’s mummified body gives up its secrets after 3,500 years",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/dec/28/egyptian-pharaohs-mummified-body-gives-up-its-secrets-after-3500-years
12/28/2021,"Just 30 years ago the IRA was bombing Downing Street, launching three mortar bombs at No 10 while John Major presided over a cabinet meeting. In 2021, Sinn Féin, the political party associated with the IRA for much of the Troubles, has moved into pole position to lead the Irish government in what could be the biggest shake-up of the state’s politics since its foundation 100 years ago.  Ireland is three years out from the next general election and a victory for Sinn Féin or any other party is far from assured, but the slow seismic shift in Irish politics has barely merited a mention outside the country despite the change in dynamics it is already creating. “It is not a question of if, it’s when Sinn Féin will be in power,” said one prominent businessman who did not want to be named. Such is their transformation south of the border and the continued courting of the middle classes, that it is creating tensions over the party identity north of the border, the is strong. Before Christmas one of its most respected TDs, the spokesperson for housing, Eoin Ó Broin, called on Gerry Adams to apologise for a Christmas sketch, joking about a slogan associated with the IRA. In a bygone era this subordination would have been a matter of discipline. Commentators have put party’s remarkable growth south of the border partly down to the transformational powers of its leader, Mary Lou McDonald, who has no connection with the troubles era and represents a radical break with the Adams era. But it is also down to a change in tactics – putting issues such as housing, the economy and health ahead of a united Ireland and – that is seen as extending its appeal beyond the working-class estates that were formerly its stronghold. Poll after poll shows it stretching its lead after a breakthrough year over the two parties that have dominated Irish politics for a century. According to a mid-December Irish Times/Ipsos MRBI poll, support for Sinn Féin now stands at 35%, a seemingly unbridgeable gap for the two main parties of the coalition government – Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael – who were at 20% apiece. Previous polls have put Sinn Féin at 32% and 33%. The Labour peer Andrew Adonis, who went to Dublin in October to observe the party at its conference and has written a 3,000-word piece for February’s issue of Prospect on its rise, said: “You can see a political revolution taking place before your eyes. “This is going to sound like an amazing thing to say but it is true, the thirst for power and the discipline behind the leader to win power reminded me of New Labour in the 1990s.” A leading businessman who asked not to be named spoke of how the party was polishing its electorability day by day, making pronounements to remove traces of links to pass darkness and announcing policies deliberately aimed at “detoxifying” Sinn Féin for the middle classes. Notably, it did not fight the government on low corporate tax, has said it will only increase taxes for “the top 3%”. McDonald told the party faithful gathered for the Ard Fheis that the pandemic had exposed the broken housing system, a dearth of rental accommodation, the inadequate health service, and the rising cost of living. Soon after she flew to the US, where she gave speeches to the National Press Club in Washington DC and the New York Bar Association on the impact of Brexit on Northern Ireland and the potential for the unification of the island of Ireland. The party has also been reaching out to business groups in an effort to detoxify its standing in corporate circles. A report in Ireland’s Sunday Business Post noted that while McDonald “likes to accuse the government of rolling out the red carpet for vulture funds and institutional investors”, its analysis of the lobbying register revealed that commercial entities who had previously avoided contact with the party were trying to open channels of communication. Sinn Féin is a secretive and highly disciplined party, with its members rarely out of step with what the leadership commands. The report also said McDonald instructed its members to reach out to businesses, unions and sectoral groups as part of preparations for government. The chance of a Sinn Féin in government in Dublin raises the prospect of the republican party, founded in 1905 in power both north and south of the border, something that could change the relationship with the UK dramatically and influence the debate, which is gathering pace south of the border, on the prospect of a united Ireland. Polls show that it has a chance of being the largest party in the May 2022 elections for the Stormont assembly. Its rise in the Republic was first signalled in 2020 when after a surge in support it won the most first preference votes in the February general election. The results did not translate into power because the party fielded 42 candidates in a race for 159, but “generated momentous shifts within the political landscape”, said Agnès Maillot, a politics lecturer at Dublin City University and author of Rebels in Government, a new book on Sinn Féin. “Until 2020, its progress could be described as a protest vote,” she said. The historian Diarmaid Ferriter said 2020 marked greater success with middle middle-class and affluent voters and the party had evolved by “compromising and adapting”. “This is the party of Gerry Adams’ legacy. In many respects he is the architect of this in the sense that he adapted Sinn Féin for constitutional purposes … He qualified their purist positions at various junctures from the 1980s onwards.” Ferriter said the expediency of Sinn Féin was nothing new. The party used to abstain from politics in Westminster and Dublin, abandoning its stance on the latter in the late 1980s. Another important juncture was the 1998 referendum removing an article in Ireland’s constitution claiming sovereignty over 32 counties to pave the way for the Good Friday agreement. “Their acceptance of the existence of Northern Ireland was another juncture as they were accepting the principle of consent. All these compromises made them more palatable,” said Ferriter. Sinn Féin’s future success will depend on how it fares in opposition over the next three years as popular policies on housing and health come under more scrutiny and the question of its past gets pushed to the fore. Ferriter drew parallels with Fianna Fáil in the wake of the civil war and independence in 1921. It was marked as a party “in the shadow of the gunmen” but “got over that fairly quickly by emphasising they had impeccable conservative credentials and they weren’t communist and they weren’t godless,” he said. “Sinn Féin will obviously be dealing with the legacies from the Troubles which crop up every so often but it doesn’t seem to dent their momentum, which suggests that this change is generational,” he added. Kevin Cunningham, a former targeting and analysis manager for the UK’s Labour party who is now a lecturer in politics at Technological University Dublin, sees Sinn Féin’s rise as a function of a nation growing in confidence and shifting away from the politics of civil war that created the two main parties on the island. “Since around 1980 and the decline in religiosity of Ireland, you see a fairly steady rise in the number of people voting for, or supporting, political parties that identify themselves on the left,” he said. “Fianna Fáil plus the Fine Gael vote stood at around 80% all the way up to 1980 and then decade after decade it just steadily declines. “Other parties existed on the left through those years. The Progressive Democrats and the Labour party, in particular, have been unbelievably weak but at the same time there has been a subset of the population self-identifying as being on the left and Sinn Féin’s capturing that and to some extent that is the kind of normalisation of politics in Ireland.”",News/Politics,‘Not if … but when’: Sinn Féin on path to power in Ireland,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/28/sinn-fein-on-path-to-power-ireland
