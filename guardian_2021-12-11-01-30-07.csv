12/11/2021,"Manchester City are targeting a sixth Premier League win in a row, and in Wolves welcome an opponent who last beat them in the league 11 years ago. Factor in City’s haul of 35 points from 15 games, with 32 scored against nine conceded, compared to the visitors 21 points from the same number of matches, with 12 goals for and 13 against, and a comfortable win for Pep Guardiola’s men seems the most likely outcome. While City will start as red-hot favourites it is worth remembering that Crystal Palace handed them a 2-0 lesson at the Etihad in October, proving that even the champions are vulnerable to an upset.

12/11/2021,"The UK’s main anti-corruption agency is facing severe criticism after judges overturned the conviction of a businessman because of its misconduct. Three court of appeal judges concluded that the Serious Fraud Office’s (SFO) failure to disclose vital evidence had unfairly led to the businessman being jailed for bribery.  The judges said that the SFO had withheld “embarrassing” evidence that would have detailed its “wholly inappropriate” dealings with a private investigator, for which the agency had already been criticised. Anti-corruption campaigners said the ruling on Friday was a “devastating setback” for the SFO. The ruling from the court of appeal causes more discomfort for Lisa Osofsky, who has headed the SFO for three years. Three judges specifically questioned whether the SFO had disclosed the full extent of her contact with the private investigator, noting that there was a “striking contrast” between the accounts given by her and the investigator. The SFO has already been compelled to set up an inquiry into its dealings with the investigator, David Tinsley, after criticism last year by the judge who presided over the original trial of the businessman, Ziad Akle. That inquiry, which is likely to be conducted by a barrister, has yet to start. During that trial, at Southwark crown court, the judge, Martin Beddoe, rebuked Osofsky and the SFO over “flattering” text messages she received from Tinsley, who was seeking to secure more favourable sentences for other businessmen involved in the case. Beddoe said that Osofsky and other senior SFO figures should not have had any contact with the investigator, who had no recognised legal role in the case. In Friday’s ruling, the three appeal court judges, Lord Justice Holroyde, Mr Justice Jeremy Baker and Mr Justice Jay, cleared Akle, who had been jailed for five years after being convicted of conspiracy to make corrupt payments to Iraqi officials. The judges said the SFO’s failure to hand over key documents had “significantly handicapped” Akle’s defence at his original trial last year, and that “in consequence, through no fault of the judge, Akle did not have a fair trial”. Akle had been one of four businessmen convicted for his role in a corrupt scheme run by a consultancy, Unaoil, that paid huge bribes around the world for years. The judges detailed how Tinsley, who runs an American private investigations firm, had been hired by the Ahsani family, which owned the Unaoil consultancy. They described how Tinsley had tried to persuade Akle and other junior employees to plead guilty, apparently in exchange for lenient sentences for the Ahsanis. Akle’s lawyers argued that Tinsley’s extensive contact with senior SFO prosecutors had undermined his chance to have a fair trial, accusing the agency of withholding documents that recorded that contact. The three judges said: “That failure was particularly regrettable given that some of the documents had a clear potential to embarrass the SFO in their prosecution of this case. We do not suggest that any individual official of the SFO deliberately sought to cover anything up.” However, they also said that the SFO had not properly explained how Kevin Davis, its chief investigator, had deleted data on his mobile phone that logged his interactions with Tinsley. “The explanation which has been put forward is that Davis repeatedly entered an incorrect code, which caused data to be wiped from his phone,” they wrote. “If that explanation is correct, it appears to have been the second time in less than a year that Davis had caused a mobile phone to be wiped and in need of rebuilding. “Moreover, it would have involved his not only entering the wrong password five times, but doing so despite a specific warning on the phone to contact the service desk.” Sue Hawley, the executive director of the campaign group Spotlight on Corruption, said the overturning of the conviction was “a devastating setback for the SFO”. “The finding of serious disclosure failures to prevent embarrassing material about the agency’s handling of the case must lead to an immediate independent and judge-led review of what went wrong, and who is responsible,” she said. Akle said: “This has been a difficult four-and-a-half years for myself and my family.” His lawyer, Jo Dimmock, said: “This case became about the conduct of the SFO. By acting in the way it did it undermined the whole justice system.” An SFO spokesperson said: “We note today’s decision by the court of appeal and are currently reviewing the judgment.” They added it would not challenge the judges’ ruling not to have a retrial of Akle.",News/Law,SFO under fire after judges overturn bribery conviction,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2021/dec/10/sfo-judges-overturn-conviction-unaoil-lisa-osofsky
12/11/2021,"Mikel Arteta has urged the Premier League to clarify the number of positive Covid-19 cases required for matches to be postponed, saying the current rules leave clubs in the dark. Tottenham’s game with Brighton was called off on Thursday after eight players and five members of staff tested positive for coronavirus. On the opening weekend of the season Arteta’s Arsenal side were required to face Brentford even though four players recorded positive tests, eventually losing 2-0, and the manager said later that he was surprised the fixture went ahead. He believes a threshold is required to eliminate uncertainty.  “That would be helpful, yes,” he said when asked whether such a ruling would be helpful. On whether the stipulations are too vague, he continued: “I think it is, because you don’t know when you have to play and when you don’t and we have some examples of that.” The Premier League has no fixed cut-off for Covid-related match postponement, which is decided on a case-by-case basis by the league’s board with submissions from clubs and medical advisers. Arteta suggested it would be preferable to abide by a firmer set of rules. “It’s about the decision-making that goes the same way for everybody and this is what we have to hope for,” he said. “We [want to] know the context where we’re going to be competing and if there are certain things that you don’t meet, then the game is off, and if you do, the game is on. [Then] we all know and it’s a fair competition.” Arsenal face Southampton on Saturday at the Emirates in a match that does not appear in jeopardy, with Arteta saying his players are “very protected in terms of vaccines” and confirming the club have put extra Covid protocols in place. Victory over an injury- and suspension-hit Saints appears a necessity after successive defeats by Manchester United and Everton, and Arteta’s biggest selection dilemma surrounds a spluttering strike force. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has not scored in his past six appearances while the rarely used Eddie Nketiah, who was lively in a substitute outing at Goodison Park but missed a clear chance, is believed to have rejected a new contract recently and could leave for free in the summer. “Eddie knows how much I rate him and I would like him to stay at the club,” Arteta said. “He has the Arsenal DNA in his blood, and he loves the club so much. His reason is that he wants to play more football, and that’s a genuine reason, it’s nothing to do with anything else. He wants more minutes, and he feels he is able to contribute much more, and that’s why I like him.” Arteta scotched suggestions he will try to sell Aubameyang, who was dropped to the bench at Everton, in January and said his captain must not lose heart. “Obviously when a player is not scoring it’s affecting his confidence,” he said. “It’s affecting the mood and probably the belief, but you have to rebel against this situation, don’t affect it and feel sorry for yourself.” Emile Smith Rowe should return after a groin injury.",Sport/Football,Arsenal’s Mikel Arteta asks for clearer rules over Covid postponements,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/10/arsenal-mikel-arteta-asks-for-clearer-rules-over-covid-postponements
12/11/2021,"Families in England could be forced to make a devastating choice over who is allowed to visit loved ones in nursing and care homes, it has emerged. The government has confirmed it is considering restricting visits to homes to just three named visitors over the Christmas period, saying it is the “natural” consequence of the uncertainty caused by the Omicron variant.  Under new measures being considered by minsters to tackle increasing cases of Covid, families and residents in England will have to choose which three visitors enter the care or nursing home over Christmas, with changes to named visitors allowed only under strict conditions. The limits have been described as “devastating” and “a body blow” for families, and a nightmare for residential homes, which are already struggling to recruit enough staff. The campaign group Relatives & Residents Association called the proposed cap “hugely disappointing”. A spokesperson said: “It just takes us back to where we were many months ago and the impact it will have on families will be devastating. It’s absolutely heartbreaking for families to have to choose who can visit them. How do you pick those three people? There are many people who have been living in care for a while and thinking that this could be their last Christmas, so it’s just going to be devastating and lead to absolutely heartbreaking decisions for so many families.” Nadra Ahmed, chair of the National Care Association, said homes had already organised Christmas entertainers, school choirs and other festive events for residents. “It will be very sad if these have to be cancelled,” she said. Ahmed questioned how care homes, already struggling to recruit sufficient numbers of staff, would have time to arrange restricted visits. “The logistics of making these new restrictions work are time-consuming,” she said. “There is already a big issue with staffing levels in homes. Where are the extra hours going to come from to facilitate this new layer of organisation?” The Independent Care Group said such a move would be disappointing but that it felt “inevitable.” Its managing director, Mike Padgham, said: “A restriction on visitor numbers as we approach Christmas, or just after, would be a body blow to those in nursing and care homes and to their families and friends who will be looking forward to spending more – not less – time together over the festive period. But as restrictions across the country become tighter and tighter, such a move does seem inevitable whilst we, as a country, fight to keep everyone as safe and well as we can.” Changes to visiting guidelines are not expected to be announced imminently but a government source has confirmed that “reductions are the next natural step to current guidance in the light of the Omicron uncertainty”. There are currently no government restrictions on the number of friends and family members allowed to visit care homes.",News/Society,Christmas care home visits in England could be restricted to three people,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/10/christmas-care-home-visits-in-england-could-be-restricted-to-three-people
12/11/2021,"The big handicap chase at Cheltenham’s December meeting has always been an obvious target for horses that ran well in the Paddy Power Gold Cup in November, and eight of the winners since 2006 lined up for that race three weeks beforehand. Only Exotic Dancer, in 2006, has completed the double, however, and he had enough quality to make the frame in a Gold Cup.  Midnight Shadow, who overcome a stumble at the last to scramble home in the Paddy Power last time, is not quite in that class and has been raised 7lb since, so once again, it may pay to look for a horse that ran well behind the winner. Lalor and Dostal Phil, close up in third and fourth, respectively, both arrive with solid claims and at the likely odds, Dostal Phil (1.50) makes most appeal at around 7-1. He is lightly-raced for an eight-year-old, with only six starts over fences behind him, and should come on for his latest start, his first since April. Doncaster 2.05 Every runner here goes to post with a chance on their best form, but Takeit Easy split two subsequent winners at Huntingdon last time and makes most appeal at the prices at around 9-2. Cheltenham 2.25 The market is focused on Blazing Khal and Gelino Bello, first and second in a similar race here last month, which makes Olly Murphy’s Barony Legends very backable at around 6-1. He was an easy winner on a tight rein at Lingfield in October but still stopped the clock in a useful time. Doncaster 2.40 Knight Salute has a penalty for his win in a Grade Two at Cheltenham last month and that could open the door for Magistrato, who was close up in fourth there, to reverse the form. Cheltenham 3.00 A couple of these are better over further so last year’s winner Song For Someone is worth an interest to build on his strong run into second when giving 6lb to the upwardly-mobile winner, Buzz, at Ascot last time. Doncaster 3.15 The Wolf ran his best race over fences with a tongue-tie applied for the first time at Perth back in April and has gone well after a break in the past. Cheltenham 3.35 Wynn House showed improved form to win at Wincanton last month and the form is backed up by the clock so a 3lb rise in the weights may not be enough to stop her following up.",Sport/Sport,Talking Horses: Dostal Phil has the quality to triumph at Cheltenham,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/dec/10/talking-horses-dostal-phil-has-the-quality-to-triumph-at-cheltenham
12/11/2021,"With the Formula One title fight between Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen rapidly approaching its climax the tension in the paddock in Abu Dhabi is palpable. Yet there was at least rapprochement of sorts for their two team principals. Before their duel in the desert Mercedes’ Toto Wolff and Red Bull’s Christian Horner, after a season of often bitter feuding, shook and almost made up. For their final pre-race press conference of the year the pair reached across the F1 constructors’ trophy between them and shook hands. “Good luck, may the best man and the best team win,” said Wolff. Both were doubtless convinced that their driver was the man in question.  Hamilton and Verstappen go into Sunday’s finale equal on points, only the second time two protagonists have been level pegging in the decider since 1974 when McLaren’s Emerson Fittipaldi and Ferrari’s Clay Regazzoni went head to head at Watkins Glen for the title, with Fittipaldi coming out on top. This time the battle has been marked by a steady deterioration in relations between teams and their drivers and with the pleasantries over Horner swiftly intimated his man, who was penalised twice in the last race in Saudi Arabia, had been the victim of a smear campaign. “Max has the spotlight positioned on him, he is running at the front and competing against a seven-time world champion,” he said. “He has had allegations about his driving, his driving style and driving standards, there has been a narrative pushed to put pressure on him.” Yet despite concerns that have echoed round the paddock all weekend that a crash between the two protagonists could decide the title, Horner remained bullish in insisting Verstappen would change nothing for the final showdown. “Max drives in a manner that ignites passion, it has brought new fans into the sport this year and we do not want him to change,” he said. “We want him to drive in the exact manner he has that has put him on the precipice of fighting with Lewis for this championship. “We have spoken about the weekend, the most important thing is for him to enjoy it and drive how he has in the previous races, to attack it in the way he has to give him those nine victories.” Wolff and Horner have traded barbs this season, with accusation and counter accusation of cheating and Wolff too could not resist a final jab. “I can understand the rationale that if things go against a team or the two drivers, I can get quite emotional in the moment and Christian has his own way of dealing with it,” he said. He also emphasised just how intense the title fight had been and that with so much at stake it was only to be expected that there would be friction between the protagonists. “It is just this fight for the trophy, one of the most important prizes in sport,” he said. “That is why you can’t expect a lot of schmoozing between the drivers, team principals and the team.” The Yas Marina circuit has undergone several adjustments including the removal of two chicanes to be replaced with faster corners in an attempt to improve the chances of passing at the circuit which has often presented a procession in the past. Given its first test as the verbal sparring began to die down it was Verstappen who took the early advantage on track. He was quickest in first practice, from the Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas with Hamilton in third, three-tenths down. In the more representative evening running, taking place at the same time as the race is scheduled, Hamilton and Mercedes were firmly on the front foot however. Having won the last three races with a dominant turn of pace he was flying in Abu Dhabi. Three-tenths up on Esteban Ocon in second and six-tenths clear of Verstappen in fourth, this was just the preparation the world champion required.",Sport/Sport,Red Bull and Mercedes almost bury hatchet before F1 title decider,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/10/red-bull-and-mercedes-almost-bury-hatchet-before-f1-title-decider

12/11/2021,"The disgraced former Conservative minister Andrew Griffiths raped his wife when she was asleep and subjected her to coercive control, a high court judge has concluded. The judgment, published on Friday, detailed alleged domestic abuse by Griffiths towards his wife, Kate, who is now a serving Conservative MP, during their marriage.  It also included pressurising her into sex, physically assaulting and verbally abusing her, the judge found. Andrew Griffiths denied allegations made by his ex-wife and “adamantly denied” rape. He resigned from the government as business minister in July 2018 for sending 2,000 sexually explicit messages to constituents and stepped down as an MP in November 2019. His wife succeeded him as Tory MP for the seat of Burton in East Staffordshire. The allegations against her estranged husband were made in a case that began as an application by Andrew Griffiths in 2019, arguing he should be allowed to spend time with a child at the centre of the case. Kate Griffiths subsequently supported an application by two journalists for the judgment to be published, including the names of her and her ex-husband.
