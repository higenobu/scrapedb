4/10/2022,"Manchester City football club faces scrutiny over its official global betting partner Marathonbet, which is approved by the Kremlin for its gambling operations in Russia. Marathonbet, which was established in Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan in 1997, is one of around 20 firms approved in Russia for betting, according to Kremlin federal tax office documents seen by the Observer. The betting firm has announced it will no longer accept bets in the UK because of “recent and ongoing events in Europe”. Marathonbet had expanded its operations across Europe over the last decade and has been a sponsor of Manchester City for nearly four years. The UK government’s Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has urged sport clubs to review sponsorship deals after the invasion of Ukraine. The department said in a statement posted last month: “Appropriate actions should be taken to limit sponsorship and other financial support from entities with links to the Russian or Belarusian states.” The Premier League champions announced their first ever global betting partnership with Marathonbet in June 2018. Under the deal, the firm agreed to provide branded betting kiosks for its fans, with its logos appearing throughout the Etihad Stadium in Manchester and on match-day interview backdrops. It announced a new partnership in December 2019 to provide branding for the club’s training kit in a deal launched by manager Pep Guardiola and the now retired striker Sergio Agüero. The training kit deal ended last year, but the firm is still a club sponsor and the Marathonbet logo was still on the club’s website this weekend. One source at Manchester City said on Friday the sponsorship deal was “coming to an end”, but the club was unable to provide further details. Marathonbet still promotes its online betting operations with images of Manchester City players. Marathonbet’s chief executive, Natalia Zavodnik, who is based in Britain, is from Russia and trained at the Moscow Aviation Institute, one of the country’s leading engineering institutes. One of the company’s key shareholders has previously disclosed he is a Russian citizen, according to legal documents. Since the invasion of Ukraine by Putin’s forces, some other betting firms, including Bet365, are reported to have shut down their operations in Russia. The website Marathonbet is still operating in Russia, but has decided to stop registering new UK accounts or accepting bets from people in the country. It said it would continue to operate in Spain, Denmark and Italy. The betting firm has a UK company, Panserve, which provides support services for betting operations, and a Channel Islands company, Marathon Alderney Ltd, which is regulated by the Gambling Commission. The company did not respond to a request for comment last week.",Sport/Football,Manchester City under pressure over Kremlin-backed sponsor,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/09/man-city-fail-to-cut-ties-to-kremlin-backed-sponsor
4/10/2022,"Harald Jähner’s Aftermath, which is published in paperback this April, starts where most popular histories of Europe’s bloody 20th century end, with Nazi Germany’s surrender in 1945. Rather than focusing on diplomatic treaties or political decisions, it explores the overlooked decade after the end of the second world war through the lives of ordinary people, diving into memoirs and trends in popular culture. Jähner, 69, was previously the editor of Berliner Zeitung’s arts section and is now an honorary professor of cultural journalism at the Berlin University of the Arts. Aftermath, which is his first non-academic book, won the nonfiction prize at the 2019 Leipzig book fair and Shaun Whiteside’s English translation was shortlisted for the Baillie Gifford prize in 2021. The original German title of Aftermath is Wolfszeit, or “Time of the Wolves”. What was wolf-like about the first decade after the end of the second world war?“Time of the wolves” was a commonly used phrase in Germany at the time, referring to the Latin “Homo homini lupus” – “man is wolf to man”. It painted a picture of a state of anarchy: everyone only cared for their own pack, their own family. The idea of community collapsed. Nowadays we know that wolves are very flexible creatures that maintain complex relationships with one another. In postwar Germany, there was often great cohesion among people, for example among the trümmerfrauen or “rubble women” who formed chains to clear up the debris left behind by the bombs. Those who lost everything did a lot to help one another. There was an experimental approach to new forms of human interactions that also made this period very exciting. People yearned for one another as much as they were scared of one another. There was also Goebbels’s propaganda myth of the “werewolf”: resistance fighters who would terrorise allied forces after the defeat of Nazi Germany. Apart from a small number of isolated cases, that myth never became reality. The vast majority of Germans were fed up with fighting. They had started to see the true face of nazism in the final months of the war, when the SS combed through a war-ravaged society in search for teenagers and pensioners they could send to the front. The same nation that had fought fanatically until the regime’s capitulation suddenly became very peaceful and obedient. You were born in 1953, almost at the end of the period you describe. What was your family’s experience of the aftermath of the second world war?I was 15 in the seminal year of 1968, and like many young people I demanded answers from my parents. I was outraged by the pictures of atrocities in concentration camps that had gradually found their way in to the press, and I wanted to know what they had done. My father had been in the navy, my mother had been a teacher in occupied Poland. Their answers were evasive, sometimes helpless. Their inability to talk about what happened to the Jews shocked us. We had a lot of fights. Did your research for this book make you look differently at your parents’ generation?Definitely. One question that animated me was how Germany has managed to become a reliable democracy. When did the Germans lose their narcissistic streak? When did these learning processes start? It can’t have been through reading Alexis de Tocqueville or the German constitution; the change of mentality must have happened at a deeper level. I started to suspect early on that my own generation’s thesis, that only the student revolution of 1968 had made Germany habitable again, was false. Our parents’ generation had learned lessons of its own accord. One extremely formative experience was the black market that flourished in the years after the end of the war. For example, the black market taught them that things were relative. The kings of the black market were young traders, 15 to 17 years old, many of them former Hitler Youth, who traded with Nazi memorabilia. During the war, objects such as the SS honour dagger had a mythological value – now they went for two cartons of Lucky Strikes. This was a generation trained in looking at the world completely without pathos. It made me understand my parents differently, and better, though I wouldn’t say I have entirely made peace with their generation. Why?In the decade after the Holocaust, Germany tried to repress its past and it largely managed to do so. That makes it hard to love that generation. I feel very uncomfortable with Germans who stylise themselves as world champions of coming to terms with your own history and want to hand out lessons to other nations. I have the feeling that this critical engagement with the past is something that is now easily championed, but I am not sure we have all learned the lessons. Are there lessons to be learned from the way Germany, once so notoriously aggressive, was pacified after the war?The allied nations of the Americans, the British and the French played a key role. American entertainment culture had a very pacifying effect on Germany: its films taught us previously unknown, relaxed and laconic attitudes. It wasn’t just chocolate and cigarettes that made American GIs attractive to German women, but because they embodied a freer lifestyle. They were softer than their German counterparts: American soldiers were seen pushing prams through bombed-out cities, which was absolutely unheard of at the time. Germany learned less about liberalism through official denazification programmes than through pop culture. If there is a lesson for these modern times, it is how important it is to keep on caring for a nation even once it has been defeated. The attitudes to war we are seeing in Germany now are also a result of the experience of the cold war, of seeing your country divided into two spheres of influence and imagining that you may have to fight against members of your own family. That created a much more dominant yearning for peace than in other European nations, like Poland. As a result, many Germans nowadays value peace more highly than freedom. What are you working on now?I am working on a book about the Weimar Republic, the time between the wars. As in Aftermath, I am interested in mass culture, popular song, dance styles, and the relations between the sexes. Which books are on your bedside table?I am reading a lot of novels from the 1920s, for example the novelist Ruth Landshoff-Yorck’s The Many and the One and Klaus Mann’s autobiography The Turning Point. When I try to relax, I pick up the collected works of Adalbert Stifter. Which book would you give to a young person?Show Them a Good Time by the young Irish short story writer Nicole Flattery, who has a better understanding of teenage despair and lust for life than anyone I’ve ever read.

4/10/2022,"Arsenal could not have envisaged a worse week than this. It ended with two defeats, five goals conceded, one scored, two key players waylaid for the foreseeable future and a giant question mark planted above hopes of Champions League qualification that had previously been sky high. They got what they deserved against a clever, composed Brighton side who had only scored once in their previous seven games, and Mikel Arteta must find a better set of solutions than this for the daunting run ahead if their challenge is to be sustained. Enock Mwepu set up Leandro Trossard’s opener and then contrived a fine goal of his own; Arsenal will rue a borderline decision to disallow an equaliser from Gabriel Martinelli and, despite a late surge, found cold comfort in Martin Ødegaard’s late strike. There was a nagging sense of unease for Arsenal from the start. The tensions surrounding both sides were evident during an opening quarter as uneventful as anything produced in the division recently and played to a crowd quieter and palpably nervier than this season’s largely buoyant Emirates support. Balls went miscontrolled, overcooked or underhit across the pitch and it would be a stretch to recall a convincing attack at either end. Brighton’s lack of confidence in the final third may be well documented but they could claim to have enjoyed slightly the better of things against opponents who could not get going. Graham Potter had set up with a dense 3-3-3-1 formation and the second of those lines, which included the 19-year-old league debutant Moises Caicedo, gave Arsenal’s midfield no breathing space. The injured Thomas Partey’s blend of physical presence and technical nous were clearly missed and the engine room Arteta began with, which saw Emile Smith Rowe and Ødegaard operate either side of Albert Sambi Lokonga, was comfortably second best. The irony was that Brighton struck just as Arsenal had begun to show a semblance of life. Joel Veltman had blocked from Bukayo Saka at a tight angle and Gabriel Magalhães had headed into the side-netting from beyond the far post, although it was still not much. Then Lewis Dunk, exposing a gaping void in Arsenal’s left-back position, swept a first-time pass into the path of a striding Mwepu. The Zambian, who had hitherto won almost everything in the engine room, had space to cut back for an unattended Trossard, who swept past Aaron Ramsdale from 14 yards. “We’ve scored a goal,” rejoiced the away fans. They might not have if Arsenal had an adequate fix for the left side of their defence but Arteta had moved Granit Xhaka there in Kieran Tierney’s long-term absence rather than select Nuno Tavares, seemingly the scapegoat for Monday’s reverse at Crystal Palace, and the resulting uncertainty was clear. Mwepu almost presented Smith Rowe with a chance but Dunk was across to block. Brighton were given a bigger let-off at the end of the half; Arsenal did not particularly deserve parity but thought they had it when, after Saka’s corner had been flicked on, Gabriel nodded back across. Gabriel Martinelli leapt to glance in from near the goalline and celebrated emphatically, but was adjudged to have been fractionally offside after a VAR delay of around four minutes. The decision was probably correct but, as with many such calls, the goal would barely have been disputed in a world before video technology. An increased share of possession brought Arsenal no significant chances before the hour. Cedric Soares squandered a promising free-kick won by Saka, who was later booked for diving, and Brighton’s layers remained firm. Eddie Nketiah replaced Smith Rowe as Arteta sought a poacher’s instinct but it was Saka, spooning over when the ball rolled invitingly for him, who fluffed their next glimmer. Arsenal would pay dearly. The goal that sealed the points was gloriously worked and taken. Brighton were not going anywhere particularly quickly to the left of Arsenal’s box but carved an opening when Trossard backheeled cutely into Caicedo’s path. Caicedo had been excellent throughout and, near the byline, conjured a perceptive chip to the edge of the area. Mwepu was waiting and it required tremendous technique, on the bounce, to produce a finish with the required power and control to beat Ramsdale. The keeper could only get a hand to the strike and Brighton had, against most prior logic, scored twice. Belatedly, Arsenal rallied. Alexandre Lacazette’s free-kick struck the bar and Nketiah’s rebound met the same fate. Then Ødegaard’s deflected effort looped in, but Robert Sánchez denied Nketiah at the death and Brighton just about held on.",Sport/Football,Brighton and Mwepu stun Arsenal to damage Champions League hopes,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/09/arsenal-brighton-premier-league-match-report
4/10/2022,"St Helens took another step towards retaining the Challenge Cup courtesy of a commanding victory. The Super League champions were handed arguably the toughest draw of the quarter-finals, with a trip to Perpignan to face the Dragons in a ferocious atmosphere in the south of France. However, as they have done so many times in recent years, they reserved one of their best performances for when it truly mattered. What looked a daunting task was navigated with some comfort as they progressed to next month’s semi-finals at Elland Road at the expense of the side they defeated in last year’s Grand Final. Catalans played their part in an entertaining contest for large periods but it was the class this St Helens juggernaut possesses in abundance that proved to be the difference. That was underlined in a blistering five-minute spell in the first half that brought three St Helens tries, and put the ­visitors in control by the break. After Fouad Yaha’s early try put Catalans ahead, the Saints responded in stunning fashion. A long-range move was started and finished by the outstanding Jack Welsby to nudge St Helens in front, before Welsby turned provider for Lewis Dodd to cross. On the following set, Saints went left and Jonny Lomax’s crisp pass was converted by Mark Percival, who raced through to make it 20-4 in the visitors’ favour. A yellow card for Curtis Sironen with half-time approaching gave Catalans a glimmer of hope, which they capitalised upon two tackles later as Gil Dudson crossed. However, any time the hosts narrowed the gap, St Helens hit back with military precision. The Saints extended their lead again after the break when Morgan Knowles forced his way across the line, and while Yaha’s second gave the home fans hope. That was eradicated as Dan Norman touched down under the posts. Any lingering doubts about the outcome were firmly put to bed when Lomax laid another try on a plate, this time Joe Batchelor the grateful recipient. Tom Davies rounded off the scoring in the final moments for Catalans, but by then, there was little doubting which side it would be taking another step closer to Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. It will take some side to stop St Helens, you feel.",Sport/Sport,Challenge Cup holders St Helens beat Catalans Dragons in dominant display,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/09/catalans-st-helens-challenge-cup-rugby-league-match-report
