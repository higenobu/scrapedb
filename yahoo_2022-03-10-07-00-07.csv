A new study is once more positing that drinking alcohol causes brain damage. In fact, the study says that drinking just two beers a day can do as much brain damage as 10 years of aging.

Over the years, we’ve seen a lot of talk about drinking responsibly. While it is known that there are chemicals in alcohol that cause brain damage, surely you can drink in moderation, right? Well, a new study posits that drinking in moderation can still carry some big risks with it. The study was published in Nature Communications this month. It focuses on the associations between drinking alcohol and the volumes of gray and white matter in your brain. Essentially, the study focuses in on how the consumption of a moderate amount of beer can lead to years-worth of changes in your brain. The study looked at more than 36,000 high-quality MRI scans from the United Kingdom’s Biobank. It followed up on research that previously focused on heavy drinkers. The authors of the study found that drinking a moderate amount of alcohol often can cause the volumes of white and gray matter to shrink in the brain. More importantly, they found that just drinking two beers each day could cause damage similar to 10 years of aging. It’s an intriguing find and one that doesn’t take into account a lot of other variables. However, it does shed more light on how little we know about the effects that drinking alcohol has on the brain, and how far we have to go before we truly understand it. While we’ve seen beer that claims it can make you smarter, ultimately, drinking beer causes damage to your brain as it shrinks the volume of gray and white matter in your brain. The study also found that the more beers you drink, the worse the damage can be. “It’s not linear,” Remi Daviet, an author on the study wrote in a statement to Penn State. “It gets worse the more you drink.” However, Daviet and the others found similar results even after removing heavy drinkers. So, no matter how you slice it, drinking alcohol causes brain damage. Of course, there are other things the study’s authors want to look into. “This study looked at average consumption, but we’re curious whether drinking one beer a day is better than drinking none during the week and then seven on the weekend, Gideon Nave, another author on the study wrote. For now, we at least have a bit more information to look at when it comes to alcohol’s effects on the human brain. In the future, perhaps these and other researchers will provide us with even more data to determine whether drinking is worth the risks it puts on the brain or not.

3/10/2022,"Russian military vehicles and equipment are still moving near the Antonov Airport, where a portion of a large military convoy was photographed Feb. 28, according to satellite images released Tuesday by Maxar Technologies. A senior U.S. defense official said Tuesday the convoy has not advanced beyond the airport in Hostomel, which is about 30 kilometers outside downtown Kyiv. The official noted that assessments show Russian forces are trying to reach Kyiv through other directions. Maxar Technologies has been tracking Russian military movements around Ukraine through satellite images since late last year, recently releasing photos that showed a large military convoy traveling toward the capital city of Kyiv and spanning nearly 40 miles of road. Clouds covered a large section of the area where the convoy was last seen, according to Maxar, but images taken Tuesday show armored vehicles and equipment moving near the Antonov Airport near Hostomel. A portion of the convoy was previously photographed in the same area on Feb. 28. Additional images released Tuesday show craters, which a Maxar spokesman said are from bombs, and a damaged bridge in Irpin, west of Kyiv. Ukrainians have been crossing the Irpin River on an improvised path underneath the bridge, which The Associated Press reported was destroyed by a Russian airstrike, in order to evacuate. Ukrainian officials told the Associated Press that a safe evacuation corridor opened from Irpin on Tuesday, but it is unclear how long it was open or how many people used it. Previous agreements for safe evacuation corridors have failed, with Ukraine claiming Russia violated ceasefire agreements. The Russian military denied firing on convoys. Two million Ukrainian refugees have left the country in the 12 days since the Russian invaded started, according to the UN Refugee Agency, with more than half traveling to Poland. “The refugees who have crossed are safe from the violence, but none were spared huge loss and trauma. Behind the monolithic statistics are 2 million stories of separation, anguish, and loss,” said Filippo Grandi, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, in a statement. U.S. defense officials estimate more than 600 Russian missiles have been fired from Russia or inside Ukraine since Russia invaded its neighbor on Feb. 24.",World/Air Force Times,"Russian military equipment, damaged bridge seen in satellite images",https://news.yahoo.com/russian-military-equipment-damaged-bridge-001320683.html
3/10/2022,"Efforts to push the Biden administration into supporting the transfer of Russian-made fighter jets to Ukraine appear doomed for both technical and geopolitical reasons. Why it matters: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky pleaded for the jets on Saturday during a Zoom call with more than 300 members of Congress, saying they were badly needed if NATO wouldn't establish a ""no-fly"" zone. Stay on top of the latest market trends and economic insights with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free Those jets would likely be Soviet-era MiG-29s possessed by Poland, which Ukrainian pilots are capable of operating. The U.S. would, in turn, backfill Poland's fleet with American-made F-16s. Reality check: White House press secretary Jen Psaki reiterated Monday the U.S. would be in ""no way opposed"" to Poland's ""sovereign decision"" to transfer its planes but stressed there are a number of logistical hurdles. Those include how the planes would actually enter Ukraine's heavily contested airspace, as well as how to accelerate the years-long U.S. procurement process for ""serious weapon systems"" like the F-16. The Russians have also been bombing Ukraine's airports, raising the specter of the planes having to be based in Poland or other NATO territory — increasing the risk of a Russian attack on soil that would have to be defended by the alliance. Between the lines: Zelensky's appeal produced an immediate and bipartisan groundswell of support. Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) sent a letter on Monday calling on the Biden administration to ""do everything we can to compensate countries that heed Ukraine’s desperate call for fighter jets to defend their homeland."" His Republican counterpart, Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho), tweeted: ""There is absolutely no reason we can’t supply airplanes to Zelensky and the Ukrainians. Our allies are willing and able to provide them, the admin needs to get out of the way."" Between the lines: Top Russian military expert Michael Kofman says it's a mistake to ""waste time"" on the MiG debate, arguing there are other supplies and weapons systems that would be more helpful to Ukraine. ""Frankly, a lot of the aircraft Ukraine has put up has gotten shot down,"" Kofman said. ""And pushing MiG-29s — are they really going to fly from air bases that are being readily barraged on a daily and nightly basis?"" Zoom out: There's also the matter of whether Poland itself is willing to risk provoking Russia, though the calculus in Warsaw could change if it received rock-solid security guarantees from the U.S. Calling a Wall Street Journal report about the potential MiG-F16 deal ""FAKE NEWS"" on Sunday, the office of the Polish prime minister tweeted: ""Poland won't send its fighter jets to Ukraine as well as allow to use its airports. We significantly help in many other areas."" A government spokesman clarified to a public broadcaster on Monday: ""It is a very delicate matter. The Polish authorities have not made any decisions on the transfer of the planes to Ukraine."" The big picture: The risk of being deemed a ""co-combatant"" by Russia continues to permeate every U.S. and NATO decision about weapons transfers and intelligence sharing. Russia's defense ministry warned Sunday that if foreign-supplied jets are used to attack the Russian military, it could be considered ""the involvement of these states in an armed conflict.""

3/10/2022,"Sean Penn is calling on the United States and Poland to get those fighter jets to Ukraine as soon as possible — and he wants the public's help. Poland offered to supply MiG-29 jets to the U.S. to be delivered to Ukraine amid Russia's unprovoked war, but the Pentagon said it is not ""a tenable"" plan. On Wednesday, Penn shared a photo of him on FaceTime with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, who emphasized the country needs those planes. ""Somewhere in the bureaucratic chain between our White House & the Polish Gov., the desperately NEEDED jets are not yet delivered to Ukraine. Public outcry may find the bottleneck,"" Penn tweeted. The Oscar-winning actor is filming a documentary about the conflict and was in Ukraine with Zelensky on the eve of Russia's invasion. He safely made it to the Polish border last week. Penn praised Zelensky for his ""courage and dignity"" during an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper on Friday. He made it clear the U.S. needs to do more. ""[Ukrainians] are fighting for their lives, and will continue to fight for their lives, and I feel that we as Americans are plummeting off a cliff — the top of which is our flag which represents all of our dreams and the best of our dreams,"" he explained. ""We'e plummeting where it will go out of our sight. I don’t know the answers. I don’t know if 'no fly zones' will create a nuclear war. I do know that we have to invest everything that we have to support the Ukrainian people, and support President Zelensky, or we will not have a memory of what America used to be."" Penn's nonprofit group, Community Organized Relief Effort (CORE), is assisting refugees and people in Ukraine. ""We're distributing hygiene kits. We’re giving cash assistance and water to refugees as they come through,"" he explained. ""We're working now to bring our staff into the other side as well because you really have two kinds of struggles with the refugees. One is trying to get out of the country, and the other, figuring out what to do.""
