2/21/2022,"DUBAI (Reuters) -A U.S.-built F5 jet in use by the Iranian military crashed into the wall of a school in the northwestern city of Tabriz on Monday, killing the two pilots and a person on the ground, Iranian state TV reported on Monday. The school was closed at the time of the crash just before 9 a.m. (0530 GMT), army spokesman Shahin Taqi-Khani said. He said technical failure appeared to be the cause of the crash, but that an investigation was underway. The pilot and a trainee pilot were killed, as well as a civilian passing by in a car, he said. The TV showed fire fighters extinghising the blaze. Experts say Iran has a poor air safety record, with repeated crashes, many involving U.S.-built aircraft bought before the 1979 Islamic revolution. The United States, which broke diplomatic ties in 1980 after Iranian students took U.S. diplomats hostage, imposed sanctions on Iran making it difficult for Tehran to buy spare parts for its military and civilian aircraft.

2/21/2022,"An Uber driver and mother of four pleaded with a passenger for her life before he shot and killed her in an attempted robbery this month, according to a criminal complaint and Pennsylvania police. Calvin Crew, 22, was arrested and charged Feb. 17 with criminal homicide, robbery and tampering with evidence in the death of Christina Spicuzza, 38, who was reported missing by her family six days earlier after she did not return home following a shift of Uber fares. When Spicuzza picked up Crew as a passenger for an Uber ride on the night of Feb. 10, he pulled a gun on her, according to a criminal complaint filed in Pittsburgh Municipal Court. In dashcam footage, Spicuzza tells her assailant, ""Come on, I have a family ... I'm begging you, I have four kids,"" according to the complaint. GPS records show Spicuzza drove through several neighborhoods with Crew as a passenger, and phone history revealed several money transfer apps were accessed on her phone during the drive, according to the complaint.

My heart breaks for Christina's children and her family,"" Victor Joseph, Allegheny County police assistant superintendent, said at a news conference Friday.

In response to the incident, an Uber spokesperson told USA TODAY on Sunday the company banned the accounts for the person who ordered the trip and the suspect. ""No family should have to suffer such an unimaginable loss and our thoughts are with Christi’s loved ones during this difficult time,"" Uber said in a statement.
