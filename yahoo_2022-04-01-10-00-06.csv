4/1/2022,"A previously undisclosed short virtual meeting between Will Smith and Academy of Motion Pictures Arts & Sciences President David Rubin and CEO Dawn Hudson on March 29 could be causing a new crisis to hit the Oscar organization. The six-minute zoom call initiated by the King Richard star to Rubin and Hudson mainly saw Smith apologize, yet again, for slapping Chris Rock during Sunday’s telecast on live TV. More from Deadline Will Packer Says That The LAPD Was Prepared To Arrest Will Smith, But Chris Rock Declined To Pursue Charges 'CODA' Surge On AppleTV+ Post Historic Oscar Wins Oscars Producer Will Packer Going On 'GMA' To Talk About Will Smith Slapping Chris Rock The new shockwave is hitting hard because those in the Academy’s Board of Governors meeting yesterday beginning disciplinary procedures against Smith weren’t in the know. “Why would they keep this from us?” exclaimed one insider who participated in Wednesday’s board meeting. “It only contributes to an atmosphere of suspicion and lack of leadership.” With seemingly contradictory information now swirling about how Smith was allegedly asked and refused to exit the Dolby Theatre after striking Rock, the efforts by the nearly 50-member Board of Governors to find an appropriate solution to the situation by its next April 18 scheduled meeting could be fracturing based on news of Rubin and Hudson’s March 29 virtual meeting with Smith. The King Richard Best Actor Oscar winner has at least 15 days notice as of yesterday before the vote regarding his violations and sanctions, to be heard beforehand by means of a written response. “What else don’t we know about what’s happening or what happened on Sunday?” stated another well positioned Academy member of the interaction between Smith, Rubin and Hudson. “This lack of transparency undermines our ability to come to a suitable resolution to the whole thing,” the AMPAS member added. Rubin and Hudson heard Smith’s apology out over how he lost it over Rock’s “G.I. Jane 2” joke over Jada Pinkett Smith’s bald head. Rubin and Hudson informed Smith that a meeting with the Governors was taking place to determine what punitive action should be taken against the Oscar winning King Richard Best Actor. Yesterday, the Board of Governors convened and agreed in majority to investigate the Smith altercation. Their next board meeting on April 18 will decide what disciplinary action could occur for the Oscar winner. This may include suspension, expulsion, or other sanctions permitted by the Bylaws and Standards of Conduct. While Smith could potentially be expelled from AMPAS, many sources don’t believe he’ll lose his Oscar. AMPAS also issued a statement Wednesday saying, “While we would like to clarify that Mr. Smith was asked to leave the ceremony and refused, we also recognize we could have handled the situation differently.” However, those close to Smith on Sunday night say that he was never directly asked by anyone associated with AMPAS to leave the Dolby Theatre; rather the idea was floated to the actor by Oscar brass via Smith’s publicist. Oscars producer Will Packer is the first among the award show’s higher-ups to speak publicly about what went down on Good Morning America tomorrow morning. That interview was teased on World News Tonight, with Packer revealing details about the LAPD’s conversation with Rock on Sunday night. “They were saying, ‘This is battery.’ That was the word they used in that moment,” Packer told GMA‘s T.J. Holmes. “They said, ‘We will go get him. We are prepared. We will go get him right now. You can press charges. We can arrest him. They were laying out the options. And as they were talking, Chris was, he was being very dismissive of those options. He was like, ‘No, I’m fine. He was like no, no, no. And even to the point where I said, ‘Rock, let them finish. The LAPD officers finish laying out what his options were. And they said, ‘Would you like us to take any action? And he said no.” On Wednesday night, Rock kicked off his Ego Death World Tour at Boston’s Wilbur Theatre, saying “I haven’t talked to anyone despite what you may have heard,” and added that he is “still kinda processing what happened” and that “at some point” he will talk about “that sh*t,” and “it will be serious, and it will be funny.” Representatives for Smith and the Academy did not return request for comment. Variety was the first to report on the Tuesday call between Smith and the Oscar bosses.

4/1/2022,"By Yoshifumi Takemoto, Yuka Obayashi and Ritsuko Shimizu TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's announcement on Thursday that he would not abandon a massive Russian gas project was decided weeks ago when he told top officials in private he wouldn't risk Japan's energy security, three sources said. Kishida assured his trade and economy minister, Koichi Hagiuda, and other officials during meetings in early March that he would stay in the Sakhalin-2 liquefied natural gas (LNG) project because leaving threatened the economy, the sources said. The sources with knowledge of those meetings declined to be identified because they are not allowed to speak on the record. Kishida on Thursday told parliament ""it is not our policy to withdraw"" from Sakhalin-2, the clearest public comments yet on the offshore project. The details of the March meetings and the subtle shift in public messaging by both Kishida and other government officials in the weeks that followed help illustrate the difficult balance the Japan has had navigating its response to Russia's Ukraine invasion with other Group of Seven (G7) nations. Even as it targets Russian banks and oligarchs with sanctions, Japan has less leeway than some of its allies to cut ties to Russian gas, on which it has become more reliant since shutting down nuclear reactors after the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Faced with national elections in July, Kishida wants to avoid soaring fuel bills and the risk of blackouts. In the immediate aftermath of the invasion - which Russia calls a ""special operation"" - Japan initially emphasised the need to move in tandem with the G7, while maintaining a stable supply of energy. But in the weeks that followed, policymakers increasingly talked about how Japan's stakes in LNG projects could be at risk of seizure and the importance of energy security. Kishida's announcement may also represent a victory for the trade ministry's energy policy over foreign ministry diplomacy, and could soothe investors in Japanese trading houses that own stakes in Sakhalin-2 and other projects in Russia. LNG DEPENDENCE For more than a decade, energy-poor Japan has tapped Russian gas to cut its Middle East oil reliance and to make up for lost nuclear capacity. Although it accounts for a small portion of Japan's LNG, the Russian gas costs a fraction of spot market rates and, along with gas from Australia and Southeast Asia, has boosted the amount of energy consumption under Japan's control to more than a third from less than a quarter a decade ago. If Japan were forced to replace Russian LNG with gas bought on the spot market, that would mean an additional cost of up to 3 trillion yen ($25 billion), at the current spot price, a senior energy agency official, who asked not to be identified, said. Japanese gas and electricity companies use Russian LNG. Hiroshima Gas, from Kishida's hometown, relies on it for half its supply. Overall, LNG accounts for a quarter of Japan's total energy mix and generates 36% of the country's electricity. ""Even if supply can be secured, the cost of gas will rise tremendously,"" said Ken Koyama, senior managing director at the Institute of Energy Economics. NATIONAL SECURITY FEARS For some government officials, the big fear is Japan would lose the right to tap gas from Sakhalin, undermining national security by threatening energy independence. Oil remains Japan's biggest energy source at around two fifths of consumption, and nearly all is transported from the Middle East along sea lanes that pass through waters patrolled by the Chinese navy. If Tokyo were to ban Russian gas, Beijing could also step in to buy it, one of the sources said. China has called for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine but has refused to explicitly condemn the invasion. Energy independence had long been a concern for Japan, and ""could eventually cause tension with Europe and the United States"", the energy agency official said. Still, Kishida may have to reconsider if France pulls out of the Arctic LNG 2 gas development project in Siberia, which is 10% owned by French oil major TotalEnergies, another one of the sources said. The United States, a close ally, has so far praised Tokyo's sanctions, including a recent ban on Russian gold and a pledge to stop potential sanctions-busting using digital assets, as ""unprecedented"". So far, the G7 has only agreed to reduce dependence on Russian energy rather than impose an immediate halt to energy purchases. Germany in particular is wary of banning Russian supplies that account for about a third of its gas. But as outrage grows over Ukraine, other G7 countries could push Kishida to halt Russian gas. ""If the rest of the G7 decide to ban Russian energy imports then Japan must do so too. If the G7 decides not to, then Japan can avoid doing anything,"" said Takayuki Homma, chief economist at Sumitomo Corp Global Research.

4/1/2022,"A dog stood over its owner’s body after apparently mauling the woman to death in a violent attack in east Tennessee, authorities say. Witnesses reported the incident Wednesday, March 30 just before 7 p.m., saying they saw someone being attacked by a dog in Tellico Village, according to the Loudon County Sheriff’s Office. Deputies arrived at the scene to find a large black dog guarding the body, authorities said in a news release. The woman, who police haven’t named while they try to notify family, was pronounced dead at the scene. “Deputies were unable to approach the victim due to the potential attack from the dog, and a LCSO Deputy was forced to shoot and kill the animal,” the sheriff’s office said. Authorities did not identify the dog’s breed. The woman’s body was taken to the Knox County Regional Forensics Center for an autopsy, the release said. A necropsy will also be performed on the dog. Deputies said the incident remains under investigation. Tellico Village is about 40 miles southwest of Knoxville. 7-month-old dies in dog attack, Georgia cops say.

4/1/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) -Ramzan Kadyrov, the powerful head of Russia's republic of Chechnya, said on Wednesday that Moscow would make no concessions in its war in Ukraine, deviating from the official line and suggesting the Kremlin's own negotiator was wrong. Kadyrov, who has Chechen forces fighting in Ukraine as part of Russia's military operation, said in comments on Telegram that President Vladimir Putin would not simply stop what he had started there. He spoke after Vladimir Medinsky, Russia's chief negotiator, said following talks with Ukraine on Tuesday that Moscow was taking steps to de-escalate the conflict, including scaling back military activity around Kyiv. ""We will not make any concessions, it was ... Medinsky who made a mistake, made an incorrect wording... And if you think that he (Putin) will quit what he started just the way it is presented to us today, this is not true,"" Kadyrov said. Kadyrov, who rose to power in the mainly Muslim southern Russian region of Chechnya in the wake of two brutal wars after the Soviet Union's collapse, has often described himself as Putin's ""foot soldier"". Moscow has poured in huge sums of money to rebuild the region under him. Though he wields outsize power and is one of the country's most influential regional chiefs, his statements contradicting Medinsky by name were highly unusual on such a sensitive subject as the war. ""This is of course a serious problem for Putin,"" said Tatiana Stanovaya, a political analyst, on Telegram.
