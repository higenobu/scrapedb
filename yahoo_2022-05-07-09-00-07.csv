5/7/2022,"STORY: However remote the possibility, these are some of the key issues surrounding the risk of a Russian nuclear strike. On February 27, three days after announcing the invasion of Ukraine, Vladimir Putin ordered his military command to put Russia's nuclear deterrent forces on high alert. Two months later, he gave a veiled but unmistakable warning: if the West intervenes in what he calls a ""special military operation,"" he could use nuclear weapons in response. ""If someone intends to intervene in the ongoing events from the outside and create strategic threats for Russia that are unacceptable to us, they should know that our retaliatory strikes will be lightning-fast. We have all the tools for this, things no one else can boast of having now. And we will not boast, we will use them if necessary. And I want everyone to know that."" The U.S. quickly called Putin's comments dangerous, escalatory and totally unacceptable. “No one should be making idle comments about the use of nuclear weapons or the possibility of using them. It's irresponsible.” Biden also told Americans not to worry about a nuclear war with Russia. Biden's comment reflects a widespread view among Western experts and officials that the chances of Russia using nuclear weapons are extremely low. They say the main aim of Russia's threats seems to be to deter Washington and its NATO allies from direct involvement in the war. Experts see a range of possibilities, if Russia were to use nuclear weapons; from a detonation over the Black Sea or an uninhabited part of Ukraine to a strike against a Ukrainian military target or on a city. But doing that could endanger Russian troops and draw radioactive blowback on Russia itself. Some analysts say Washington could opt for a conventional military response rather than a proportional nuclear counterstrike. NATO might seek to redesign its U.S.-built ballistic missile shield in Poland and Romania to shoot down Russian rockets in future. It remains unclear whether a Russian strike might make other nuclear states such as India and Pakistan more likely to use such weapons.",Politics/Reuters Videos,Will Russia use nuclear weapons?,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-nuclear-weapons-231750731.html
5/7/2022,"At a gala Thursday night for an anti-abortion group, former Vice President Mike Pence took aim at sitting Vice President Kamala Harris over remarks she delivered at a pro-choice group’s annual gala two nights earlier. “I say with the lives of 62 million unborn boys and girls ended in abortion since 1973, generations of mothers enduring heartbreaking and loss that can last a lifetime: Madame Vice President, how dare you?” Pence told anti-abortion activists at the annual gala for Carolina Pregnancy Center in Spartanburg, S.C. On Tuesday, Harris spoke at the Washington gala for EMILY’s List, where she sharply criticized Republicans and conservative justices on the Supreme Court after it was revealed that the high court was poised to overturn Roe. v. Wade. “Women in almost half the country could see their access to abortion severely limited,” Harris said of the forthcoming decision. “In 13 of those states, women would lose access to abortion immediately and outright. Those Republican leaders who are trying to weaponize the use of the law against women, well we say, ‘How dare they! How dare they tell a woman what she can do and cannot do with her own body! How dare they!’” Democrats and Republicans have been drawing their battle lines this week, after a stunning scoop by Politico revealed a draft opinion showing the Supreme Court poised to overturn Roe v. Wade, likely ending federal protection for abortion rights and kicking the issue to the states. Pence, a staunch anti-abortion politician, was the headliner at Thursday’s gala, while Harris, who is equally pro-abortion-rights, had top billing at Tuesday’s fundraiser. Neither Pence nor Harris have announced that they will run for president in 2024 or beyond, but both are seen as likely candidates should their respective former running mates decide to opt out.",Politics/Yahoo News,'How dare you?’: Pence goes after Harris for Roe comments,https://news.yahoo.com/how-dare-you-pence-goes-after-harris-for-roe-comments-005522418.html
5/7/2022,"Donald Trump will be fined $10K a day until he signs a 'Jackson affidavit—' named for a 1987 personal injury case from the Bronx. NJ lawyer Eugene M. Banta is shocked his old case, Jackson vs. NYC, is the precedent for Trump's fine. 'It's just amazing to me,' he told Insider of the 35-year-old case he'd won just out of law school. It was 3o years ago, and the ink was barely dry on his law degree, when Eugene M. Barta argued his first-ever appellate case under the coffered wood ceilings of a Manhattan courtroom. ""I was happier than a pig in mud,"" he remembers of winning. But Barta could never have imagined that his win in a minor personal injury case would set an important precedent — and today ensnare a former president. Donald Trump is being fined $10,000 a day for failing to comply with New York Attorney General Letitia James' demand that he turn over business documents. The fine reached $110,000 on Friday, and will keep accruing until Trump signs what's called a ""Jackson affidavit,"" a sworn, detailed description of his failed search for the documents James wants. That's Jackson, as in Barta's old personal injury case, Jackson vs. the City of New York. ""All I could think of was the butterfly effect — something completely random,"" he told Insider Friday, after learning of his inadvertent role in Trump's spiraling fine. ""Having an impact 30-something years later is just amazing to me,"" added Barta, 66, now a commercial collections attorney with Heitner & Breitstein in Marlboro, NJ. ""Jackson vs. NYC"" was named for Christophena Jackson, who was badly hurt at age 64 when a stairway collapsed in her city-owned South Bronx apartment building in 1984. First as a change-of-career law student and then as a new lawyer, Barta helped his attorney father, also named Eugene M. Barta, go to bat for the woman. They fought the city's stonewalling for nearly a decade. ""It was just one stall after another,"" Barta remembers. ""It was like pulling teeth to get documents."" The city failed to turn over a single maintenance or inspection record for Jackson's building at 970 Prospect Avenue. Instead, in 1990, it had a city employee sign a sworn statement — an ""affidavit"" — stating in three brief paragraphs that she had looked in the ""Central Files,"" and in the ""Archive Files,"" and found nothing. Barta argued that the city shouldn't just be allowed to say ""we looked; there's nothing there."" They should face some sanction for failing to produce a single record. The appellate court agreed. ""Here, after years of delay, the affidavit presented by the City made no showing as to where the subject records were likely to be kept, what efforts, if any, were made to preserve them, whether such records were routinely destroyed, or whether a search had been conducted in every location where the records were likely to be found,"" the appellate court said in its ruling. ""In short, the affidavit provided the court with no basis to find that the search had been a thorough one or that it had been conducted in a good faith effort to provide these necessary records to plaintiff."" The court ruled that any potential jury in the case would be told to assume that the city did indeed have advance notice of the dilapidated stairwell, and had failed to fix it. And the 1992 decision became state case law that's now costing Trump $10,000 a day. In scores of New York cases since Barta's win, whenever people or businesses or governments fail to turn over court-ordered documents, judges have demanded ""Jackson affidavits—"" sworn statements specifying where the records should have been, what was done to preserve them, and ""whether a search had been conducted in every location where the records were likely to be found."" The very kind of sworn statement that is now demanded of Trump, who is appealing the fine and the contempt-of-courrt finding. ""I thought I had a pretty good case,"" Barta remembered Friday. ""But I had no idea that the Jackson affidavit was named after my Mrs. Jackson from 35 years ago,"" he said. ""Almost 40 years now, that's been the standard, which is kind of funny."" Barta declined to talk about Trump, or Trump's fine. But he was very happy to talk about Christophena Jackson, who he still remembers fondly. ""She came into the office once or twice,"" he said. ""A very nice, older woman. She was legitimately injured. She just wanted to be compensated for falling down the stairs."" He doesn't remember the settlement the city finally agreed to for Jackson in 1994, who was by then around 75 years old. ""We haggled a little bit,"" he said, with a laugh, of his negotiations with the city. ""She reminded me of my grandmother,"" he added. ""And I just thought she was a sweet old lady.""""
