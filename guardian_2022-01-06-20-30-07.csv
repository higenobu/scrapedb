1/6/2022,"Nicolas Cage has said actors need to be able to use a gun as it is “part of the job”, in comments responding to the fatal shooting on the set of Rust in which cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was killed. Cage was speaking as part of a wide-ranging roundtable discussion for the Hollywood Reporter with fellow actors including Peter Dinklage, Jonathan Majors and Andrew Garfield. On being asked whether guns should be banned from film sets in the wake of the Rust shooting, Cage responded by saying that “movie stars” needed to know how to perform certain activities that may be outside the experience of workaday actors. “You need to know how to fight. You’re going to do fight scenes. You need to know how to ride a motorcycle. You need to know how to use a stick shift and drive sports cars, and you do need to know how to use a gun. You do. You need to take the time to know what the procedure is. Those are part of the job profiles.”  Cage also added that these can overlap with the role of a stunt performer, in a mutually beneficial way. “The stunt man and the movie star are two jobs that coexist. Every stunt man needs to be a movie star, and every movie star needs to be a stunt man.” Hutchins died, and director Joel Souza was wounded, on the Rust set in October 2021, after a live round was discharged from a gun carried by actor Alec Baldwin, as Baldwin was rehearsing for a scene.

While there I went on seven-day horse group trek with Stepperiders. It was under £500 for the week. Having just been through a difficult breakup it was enormously cathartic galloping over the steppe with new friends, camping by night, and enjoying homecooked food every day. I truly felt as if I was away from it all. Staying in Ulaanbaatar itself was safe, affordable and friendly. I met so many female solo travellers on my trip too, some of whom I’m still in touch with. I am not someone who normally travels alone, but I came back feeling very much empowered by it.Nadia Zuberi-Clow This is Mount Fitz Roy, in the southern Andes. We started our trip at El Chalten, a frontier town full of walkers and climbers; beyond that there is only the mountains then the Southern Patagonian Icefield, stretching to the Pacific via Bernardo O’Higgins and Torres del Paine national parks. The eternal winds blowing off the ice field mean bad weather is frequent, and we had prepared for the possibility that in our three-day stay we might not be able to see and do anything much. But we got lucky. Pictured is our first view of the mountains, on the long drive across the Argentinian steppe. It perhaps captures a bit of our awe and excitement, but not the fierce wind that made simply getting out of the car challenging.

Marian had been trying to photograph lightning, unsuccessfully as it happened.

1/6/2022,"A ghost orchid that grows in complete darkness, an insect-trapping tobacco plant and an “exploding firework” flower are among the new species named by scientists in the last year. The species range from a voodoo lily from Cameroon to a rare tooth fungus unearthed near London, UK. A new tree from the ylang-ylang family is the first to be named in 2022 and is being named after the actor and environmentalist Leonardo DiCaprio. He campaigned to revoke a logging concession which threatened the African tree, which features glossy yellow flowers on its trunk.  The highlighted plants are among the 205 new species named in 2021 by scientists from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and their collaborators around the world. All are vital parts of the planet’s biodiversity and some may provide food and medicine. However, several are already extinct in the wild and many threatened by the destruction of forests, expanding palm oil plantations and mining. There are 400,000 named plant species and two in five are threatened with extinction. The scientists said it was a race against time to identify new plants before they disappeared for ever. In total, scientists across the world have named about 2,000 new plant species each year for at least a decade. “It’s almost bewildering that we’re still discovering so many,” said Dr Martin Cheek, at RBG Kew. “But now is our last chance to find unknown species, name them and hopefully protect them before they become globally extinct.” The new ghost orchid is one of 16 new orchids from dense and remote forests in Madagascar, It was named Didymoplexis stella-silvae by Kew’s Johan Hermans, meaning “star of the forest” as it grows in complete darkness and has star-like flowers. It has no leaves or chlorophyll for photosynthesis and gets all its nutrients in symbiosis with underground fungi. The flower only pokes through the forest-floor humus for a day to attract pollinators, which may be ants. Three of new orchids are already thought to be extinct in the wild due to destruction of their forest homes, including one tree-dwelling species that was likely eradicated due to the demand for geranium oil used in aromatherapy. “Sadly, Madagascar’s many unique plants are under threat from deforestation and droughts, floods, and fires caused by climate change,” said Hermans. “It really is a race against time.” The unusual tobacco plant was among seven new species found near a truck stop in Western Australia and is covered in sticky glands that trap and kill insects, most likely as a defensive measure. “The arid parts of Australia, which include most of the continent, have been thought of as almost barren, but in recent years these poorly studied areas have yielded many new and unusual species,” said Prof Mark Chase, at RBG Kew. The tropics are known hotspots for biodiversity and a spectacular new species of primrose found in Borneo was named Ardisia pyrotechnica because its shower of white flowers resembles exploding fireworks. However, it is already assessed as critically endangered, as only a few plants have been found in two locations and it is under threat from palm oil plantations. “Who knows how many thousands of plant species it will be revealed in future to have likely become extinct due to palm oil plantations,” said Cheek. “It’s sickening.” The new pink voodoo lily has a 30cm-tall flower spike and was found in a small corner of the vast Ebo Forest of Cameroon. The tree named after Di Caprio was also found in the Ebo Forest. But despite the cancelling of logging permits in August 2020 by the president of Cameroon, Uvariopsis dicaprio remains critically endangered because its habitat remains unprotected from potential future logging. The new fungus was first found in the UK’s Windsor Great Park under a sweet chestnut tree in 2008, but not named until now as DNA analysis of a suite of species had to be completed together. It is one of a group of unusual fungi that form mushrooms with elongated teeth under their caps, rather than gills, and are becoming rarer due to nitrogen pollution from agriculture. Another new species, a blue-berried bush from the coffee family found in Borneo, took even longer to be scientifically named. It was first seen by scientists in a painting by the eminent botanical artist Marianne North, made in 1876 during a stay by the Sarawak river. One new species was discovered not in the wild, but in the laboratory. The microscopic fungus was found lurking in a wild banana seed from Vietnam kept at Kew’s Millennium Seed Bank in Sussex. Fusarium chuoi, which has a coral colour and a velvety texture, is an “endophyte”, a fungus that lives inside a plant without causing it any visible harm. Distinguishing these from pathogenic fungi is crucial for protecting plant health, the scientists said. Among the other new species highlighted were a periwinkle from the Andean valleys in Bolivia, which has kiwi-like fruits that are edible when roasted and may also have medicinal properties and five pretty Cape primroses from the Democratic Republic of the Congo that are threatened by copper mining. “So many of our medicines come directly from plants, or are inspired by compounds that come out of plants,” said Cheek. “If we make species extinct before we can even look at what chemicals are inside them, isn’t that bonkers?”",News/Environment,‘Ghost’ orchid that grows in the dark among new plant finds,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/06/ghost-orchid-that-grows-in-the-dark-among-new-plant-finds
1/6/2022,"Climbing, says Anna Fleming, is “a form of dance”, an intensely physical ballet between self and rock. This book charts her stony path to mastering the craft of traditional climbing, from being a “terrified novice” to a “competent leader”. Unlike sport climbing, where bolts are left in the rock for others to use, traditional climbing involves a lead climber who inserts metalware into cracks in the rock, to which safety ropes are attached. These are then collected by the climber’s partner.  Leading, Fleming admits, used to terrify her. But what she describes as the “electrifying charge” of risk is an essential part of learning to climb. Falling and being caught by the rope is a necessary experience. Climbing the Cuillin on Skye in her early 20s, she was saved by her rope from “the brink of a mortal abyss” when a large block she caught hold of came loose. “I walked away feeling deeply humbled, carrying an enhanced respect for the gravity of these heightened places,” she writes. Only when she returned four years later to complete the route did she feel that her “mountain apprenticeship” had been truly served. As an undergraduate she began climbing indoors: “On the wall I became a network of muscles, limbs, senses, nerves, cells and neurons; an active, thinking, sensing being.” Climbing gave her “a new map of my body”. In the early 2000s, a woman could find herself alone among men on an indoor climbing wall. Now they are full of women and girls, and the climbing community feels different: “It seems like a quiet revolution has happened in the last 10 years.” Rock climbing was a different challenge, with its changeable conditions and the need for absolute attention. It demanded an intense focus on the world at her fingertips – cracks, surface texture, flakes of rock – to find a route to the top. In this heightened state of awareness, “thousands of years vanish and I hear the acute sensitivity of my ancestors”. But at the summit a new perspective opens up, revealing distant landscapes and wildlife. These two viewpoints – the micro and the macro – offer a transformative sense of one’s place in the scheme of things. For Fleming, climbing is not about “reducing huge landscapes and environments to peaks that must be conquered”. It’s a more personal and profound experience, offering “a direct route into the spellbinding potency of place”. Nan Shepherd described “walking out of my body and into the mountain”. Fleming, too, finds that while climbing, the self disappears, “lost to movement and environment”. She describes how the “physical contact and bodily perception” of climbing offers her both a “journey into the rock” and a profound connectedness to the landscape, an existential rootedness in nature that echoes the current writing of Elizabeth-Jane Burnett and Robin Wall Kimmerer. Fleming has written a wonderfully intimate account of climbing, filled with the rough texture of rocks and the hard-won elation of reaching for the skies. This is a book about geology and place, selfhood and nature – a rich celebration of “stony matter” and our relationship to it across the ages.

1/6/2022,"It was just after sunrise on New Year’s Eve when climate scientist Daniel Swain paused outside his home in Boulder county, Colorado. Snow was beginning to fall and a strong acrid smell – “like burned plastic”, Swain said – hung on the newly chilled breeze. A fast-moving wildfire had torn through the area the day before, leaving devastation in its wake. Driven by winds of more than 100mph, what started as a small brush fire swiftly consumed nearly 1,000 homes within 24 hours.  While relatively small in size – just 6,000 acres – the wildfire was the most destructive in Colorado’s history, a feat that speaks to the growing danger of what Swain calls the “urban fire storm”. Areas where suburban sprawl meets landscapes primed by drought and other climate conditions to burn – known as the wildland urban interface (WUI) – are growing, posing new threats in places once considered safe from wildfire. The Colorado fire engulfed neighborhoods and commercial districts alike, forcing 35,000 people to flee their homes. It torched a Target, a Tesla dealership, and a Costco, not long after unsuspecting Sunday shoppers were evacuated. Two people are still missing. “The wildland urban interface extends over a far broader area than many folks realize – and it is also dynamic,” Swain said. “Most of the time it is true that these areas are safe from wildfire but given conditionally extreme wind conditions and extreme drought, they became part of that interface.” That the fire also happened in December, a time once considered well outside of fire season, has also raised alarm. “It was strange to have the snow start falling,” Swain said, “and to have that smell of the remnants of almost 1,000 homes wafting through the air.” The area had had one of its warmest winters. This year, the 30in of snowfall Boulder typically gets by December failed to appear. The region saw just 1.6in of precipitation since the beginning of August. “That’s natural variability,” Atmospheric scientist Matthew Cappucci noted on Twitter, “But in warmer world, it’s easy to evaporate more of what little water falls.” When the fire ignited, drought levels in the area were classified as “extreme” by the US Drought Monitor. It’s long been clear that what’s considered “fire season” is stretching longer, covering more months of the year. And, while that increases the number of days when a fire could start it also brings conditions in line with winter weather patterns – like dry wind – that vastly increase the danger. Strong gusts aren’t unusual in Colorado, especially in the Boulder area, but without snow and rain to dampen the risks, disaster was able to strike. “A lot of these events – from fires to mudslides – are just a consequence of extreme events many months in the making,” said Andrew Hoell, a meteorologist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s physical sciences laboratory, noting the compounding effect drought and heat has had on fires. Record-low precipitation was intensified by record-high temperatures. It’s a recipe for disaster, and one that Hoell is familiar with. “I am used to talking about extreme events,” he said. But, based in Boulder, this one hit close to home. His house was spared, but many in his community, both colleagues and friends, lost their homes. “It always gets you down. But when it’s your friends, your neighborhood, your community – it is a whole different ball game.” Thousands without homes are searching through the rubble and trying to put back the pieces. Recovery is expected to take years. The cause of this blaze is still under investigation. The Boulder county sheriff, Joe Pelle, told reporters that downed power lines, which were initially suspected as the ignition source, have been ruled out. Most fires are still started by people, intentionally or not, and with more people living in high-risk areas, the dangers only continue to mount. “What the science said is that growth is occurring faster in the wildland urban interface than anywhere else” said Carrie Berger, fire program manager of the forestry & natural resources extension fire program at Oregon State University. “That’s where people are moving most rapidly.” A third of US homes currently stand in the WUI and that number is only going to grow as the construction march into the wildland continues, and as higher temperatures increase the boundaries of burnable land. That’s why scientists and disaster experts are pushing for a shift in focus from suppression to preparation. “We live in a fire landscape,” Berger said. “I don’t think there’s any place that is safe from wildfire.” She emphasized the need for a community approach to fire safety, complete with home hardening techniques like reducing vegetation that brushes up to buildings, crafting and coordinating plans, and using fire-resistant building materials. Climate scientist Daniel Swain echoed her calls. While this disaster hit close to home, he emphasized that the next one could occur anywhere. “This is not a unique problem to Boulder county. This is not a unique problem to Colorado. This is not even a unique problem to the American west – and I think this comes at a surprise to most people,” he said. As temperatures rise and aridification spreads into other landscapes, big blazes could erupt out of the forested areas in the upper midwest. They could spread through Florida, burn in Georgia, or blacken suburban New Jersey the way they do now in California and Colorado. “All of a sudden you have conditions that really aren’t all that different from what they would be like in the west,” Swain says. “That might make things possible that were simply impossible before.”",News/World news,‘Urban fire storm’: suburban sprawl raising risk of destructive wildfires,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/urban-fire-storm-suburban-sprawl-wildfires-colorado
1/6/2022,"There were cheers from the public gallery of Bristol crown court when the verdicts of not guilty were returned. Eighteen months after Bristol’s now infamous statue of the slave trader Edward Colston was sent crashing to the pavement, the four young people who had been charged with criminal damage were acquitted. The strategy that the prosecution appear to have adopted – in a case that some now argue should never have been brought to trial – seemed to centre on asking that the jury be blind to history. Who the statue venerated, they argued, was irrelevant. This, they claimed, was an open-and-shut case of criminal damage, one in which the defendants did not even deny their role in the toppling of the statue or, in one case, helping to roll it to Bristol harbourside, from where it was cast into the water.  The contention of the prosecution was that the crimes of Edward Colston, shareholder and ultimately deputy governor of the Royal African Company, the most prolific slave-trading entity in British history, should simply be set aside. That the statue depicted a man whose wealth was based on the enslavement of 84,000 men, women and children was immaterial. As was the fact that he was complicit in the deaths of 19,000 of them, who died, squirming in agony, chained to the decks of the Royal African Company’s slave ships. That should be of no concern to jury. Their suffering, their deaths, their very existence was irrelevant to the issue at hand. In adopting such a strategy the prosecution was merely asking the jury to occupy the same stance of wilful, moral blindness that Colston’s defenders have occupied for decades. That strategy failed because the lawyers defending the so-called Colston 4 were able, through their own legal arguments and the striking eloquence of the four young defendants, to place history at the centre of this trial. In this I played a small part, appearing as an expert witnesses for the defence. They successfully demonstrated that the real offenders were not the Colston 4, but the city of Bristol and those who have done everything in their power to burnish the reputation of a mass murderer. The keepers of Colston’s legacy had rendered his historic crimes live and present through the erection of a statue to him. By allowing that edifice to stand for 125 years, even as Bristol became home to thousands of black people whose ancestors had been victims of the trade that the Royal African company had pioneered, they had, so argued the defence, permitted the statue to become an “indecent display”. Having established these arguments Liam Walker QC, representing Sage Willoughby, the youngest of the defendants, argued that the Colston 4 “were on the right side of history”. The jury were invited to join them there. In the aftermath of this verdict those who now have questions to answer are Colston’s defenders. In particular the Society of Merchant Venturers, a grouping that for decades dismissed and discounted appeals for the statue to be removed or contextualised. Its strategy of muddying waters and maintaining the status quo fostered indecision and inaction. Decades of inertia were brought to an end in just under three hours – the time it took for the jury to arrive at its verdict. The merchant elite of late Victorian Bristol who erected the statue of Colston, many of them members of the Merchant Venturers, did so in the full knowledge that the man they sought to elevate to civic sainthood had been a trader in human flesh. The details of his grim career had been obscured but not obliterated. Despite what they knew they expanded the bizarre cult of rituals, religious services and exclusive dinners that had been built around him, but their most public triumph was the erection of the statue. To validate the imposition of the cult of Colston on to the wider city they falsely implied that the statue had been paid for through popular, public subscription. They did all of this confident in the belief that no one would ever question their decisions, as no one would ever come to care about Colston’s crimes or his victims. Their confidence sprang from their collective inability to envisage a future moment in which the Africans who had perished in the bellies of the Royal African Company’s ships, or on the plantations of Barbados or Jamaica, would matter to anyone in Bristol or beyond. The moment they were unable to conceive of is now. The generation for whom the lives of Colston’s victims matter deeply is the generation from whom the four defendants in this case were drawn. In the months since the murder of George Floyd millions of people across the world have examined their nations’ official histories, and the history lessons they were taught at school. They have discovered missing chapters, half-truths and lost connections between the crimes of then and the inequalities of now. As Rhian Graham, one of the Colston 4, noted in the impromptu speech she made from the pavement outside court, the dethronement of Colston was not a stand-alone event, but part of a global movement. I am writing this from Covid isolation in a hotel on the southern coast of Barbados. From my window I can see the approaches to the island, the sea lanes along which the ships of the Atlantic slave trade once passed, before docking to unload their human cargoes. To the north of me is a place called Speightstown, its nickname in the 18th century was “Little Bristol”, so firmly was it connected to the slave traders and sugar merchants of that English city 4,000 miles away. The global shift of consciousness that inspired the toppling of Colston was also a factor in the decision made by the people of this island to break decisively away from that history and become a republic. This shift in consciousness, translated into action across the world by the young, will be strengthened by this verdict; and by the very fact that when made aware of long obscured historical and moral truths, an English jury chose to place themselves – and the city of Bristol – on the right side of history.

1/6/2022,"French MPs have passed the government’s controversial vaccine pass bill after three days of an angry stop-start debate. The legislation, which requires people to be fully vaccinated to enjoy social, sporting and cultural activities, was approved by a large majority in the assemblée nationale in the early hours of Thursday morning.  The bill was passed by 214 votes against 93 and 27 abstentions. It will now be presented to the upper house, the sénat, to be debated on Monday. Ministers had hoped to introduce the controversial measure on 15 January, but the often heated parliamentary debate was suspended twice this week. The law was first held up when MPs voted to go home just before midnight on Monday, then again on Wednesday after a row erupted over language used by the president, Emmanuel Macron’s when he promised to make life difficult for unvaccinated people. While more than 90% of French adults have been fully jabbed, one of the highest rates in the world, the remaining 10% – estimated at around 5 million people, including Brigitte Bardot, the actor turned animal activist, have refused to have the Covid vaccine. Until now they have been able to use a passe sanitaire (health pass) that required either vaccination, recovery from Covid or a negative Covid test for everyone over the age of 12 to access restaurants, bars, museums, theatres and other public places. In October, the government put an end to free Covid tests for unvaccinated people, but the new legislation goes a step further in requiring people to be fully vaccinated to access such places. Emmanuel Macron’s deliberate choice of the French word emmerder to define his strategy on making daily life difficult for unvaccinated people presented an English translation challenge and a debate on social media. The verb emmerder — derived from the word merde, or shit — was slammed by Macron’s political opponents as vulgar and beneath a president’s standing. It can be translated in several ways and carries a sense of creating hassle for someone. Macron said in a newspaper interview that he “really wanted” to “emmerder” unvaccinated people by curbing access to places including restaurants and cafés. It has also been translated as Macron wanting to “piss off” the unvaccinated, which certainly conveys the vulgarity of the word. But Macron defined his strategy as not just aimed at making unvaccinated people angry, but in practical terms making their daily lives difficult, suggesting a sense of putting them “in the shit”. He is not the first French president to spark debate over translating the informalities of the French language. Another example was Nicolas Sarkozy muttering “Casse-toi pauvre con” at an agricultural fair (which the Guardian said broadly meant “Get lost, you prat”.) Macron said the measure was intended to coerce vaccine-hesitant people to get inoculated by further restricting their everyday activities. The law also introduces hefty fines and prison sentences for anyone caught using or supplying fake vaccine passes and for establishments that fail properly to check visitors’ vaccine status. The pass will not be required for shops or medical facilities such as hospitals and clinics. Vaccination is currently compulsory only for health workers, but the new law would extend this to those who work in venues where they are in contact with the public. Macron, who is expected to be re-elected in April, has ruled out making the vaccine obligatory for everyone. About 66,000 people had their first vaccine on Wednesday after the president’s controversial comments, the highest number in 24 hours since the beginning of October. The prime minister, Jean Castex, told the French news and weather channel BFMTV he hoped the vaccine pass could come into force on 15 January as originally planned and described the Covid situation in France as “extremely worrying”. Castex defended Macron’s controversial use of the verb “emmerder” (widely translated as “piss off”) in his vow to put pressure on those French people who refused to be vaccinated, saying the former president, Georges Pompidou, had used the same word. Macron also angered critics by calling unvaccinated people irresponsible, adding: “Someone irresponsible is not a citizen.” “Let’s not play with words, of course the non vaccinated are still [French] citizens,” Castex said. “What the president wanted to say is that when you are a citizen of our beautiful republic, you have rights, but also duties. It’s called civic-mindedness, it’s called a sense of responsibility.” On Thursday, it was revealed Bardot was among those facing Macron’s ire: the 87-year-old actor said she had not been vaccinated as she was “allergic to all chemical substances”.",News/World news,French MPs pass controversial Covid vaccine bill with large majority,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/french-mps-pass-controversial-covid-vaccine-bill-with-large-majority
1/6/2022,"Motorists paid £5m more a day for fuel than they should have last month after petrol station owners refused to pass on a drop in wholesale prices to consumers, the RAC has claimed. The motoring organisation called December a “rotten month” despite the price of unleaded petrol falling by 2p per litre, after estimating that petrol retailers should have reduced the cost by 12p.  The RAC said that instead of pocketing the traditional long-term margin of 6p a litre, retailers took an average of 16p a litre on petrol and 12.5p on diesel. Across December, the RAC estimates that drivers collectively lost out on £156m, or £5m a day, from the wholesale price cuts not being passed on by retailers. “December was a rotten month for drivers as they were taken advantage of by retailers,” said Simon Williams, fuel spokesperson at the RAC. “In the past when wholesale prices have dropped retailers have always done the right thing – eventually – and reduced their pump prices. “This time they’ve stood strong, taking advantage of all the media talk about ‘higher energy prices’ and banked on the oil price rising again and catching up with their artificially inflated prices, which it now has done.” The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA), the body which represents independent filling stations in the UK, said that the retail fuel market was“extremely competitive” and that drivers were likely to have benefited more than the RAC’s figures indicated. “December’s pump price data is less reliable because it is taken from fuel card transactions, and there have been far fewer of these transactions because of the reduction in business activity between Christmas and New Year,” said Gordon Balmer, executive director of the PRA. “The costs of running petrol stations rose all year, with electricity up 19%, vastly reduced margins from fuel cards as well as increased national insurance and wage inflation.” In September, the PRA chair, Brian Madderson, said he did not “condone profiteering” as petrol prices rocketed and filling stations ran dry due to panic buying. The RAC said in December it cost drivers £6 more to fill up a typical family car than if petrol retailers had stuck to taking the traditional 6p margin and passed savings on to motorists. Diesel vehicle owners paid £4 more than they potentially could have. The RAC said at the end of last year Asda had the cheapest petrol, followed by Sainsbury’s, while motorists in Northern Ireland have the cheapest petrol on average in the UK.",Lifestyle/Money,"UK drivers overcharged by £5m a day for petrol, claims RAC",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/06/uk-drivers-overcharged-by-5m-a-day-for-petrol-claims-rac
1/6/2022,"Greggs has said sales last year exceeded pre-pandemic levels, as Britain’s biggest bakery chain named the company veteran Roisin Currie as its new chief executive. The company – known for its sausage rolls, steak bakes and vegan snacks – said in a trading update that it expected to beat its financial forecast for 2021 when it reports official full-year results in March.  Greggs said sales hit £1.2bn last year, a 5.3% increase on 2019, although down 3.3% on a like-for-like basis, excluding new store openings over the period. It also announced that Currie, a 12-year company veteran and the current retail and property director at the bakery chain, would take over from the chief executive, Roger Whiteside, in May. Whiteside, who has run Greggs for nine years, will continue to work with the company to “support the transition process” until his notice period expires on 5 January next year. Shares in Greggs have risen from £4.70 when Whiteside started as chief executive in February 2013 to more than £33.00 on Thursday morning. Currie, who joined Greggs in 2010, is responsible for the chain’s 2,200 stores across the UK and rapidly expanding home delivery partnership with Just Eat. “Roisin has played a central role in the success of Greggs as it has developed as a multi-channel food-on-the-go business and I am delighted that she will lead the next phase of our growth as chief executive,” said Ian Durant, Greggs’ chair. “She has deep experience of our culture and our strategic plan, and will lead with energy and character.” Currie will become chief executive designate and an executive director from 1 February and take over from Whiteside at the company’s annual general meeting in May. Greggs said it sold 6.7m mince pies in the run-up to Christmas, as fourth quarter like-for-like sales beat 2019 levels by 0.8%, despite “continued disruption to staffing and supply chains”. Whiteside praised the efforts of the company’s 25,000 staff, who would be receiving their annual pay awards five months early. “Greggs has made great progress in 2021 despite tough trading conditions,” Whiteside said. “We enter 2022 with a strong financial position that will support our ambitions to accelerate the rate of growth in our shop estate whilst developing new digital channels and extending the trading day.” The company opened 131 new shops last year and closed 28, and has expanded its home delivery service with Just Eat to 1,000 outlets. Greggs plans to open 150 stores this year and intends to pay shareholders a special dividend of £30m to £40m, depending on trading conditions. The company said inflationary pressure increased towards the end of last year and was “likely to remain elevated in 2022”. “While conditions in the first few months of 2022 are likely to remain challenging, we are confident that we are well placed to make progress on the many attractive opportunities that lie ahead,” Whiteside said.",News/Business,Greggs ups sales forecast as it names new CEO,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/06/greggs-sales-forecast-new-ceo-bakery-chain-roisin-currie
1/6/2022,"There was a moment early in the second day at the Sydney Cricket Ground when Steve Smith looked nailed on for a hundred. Sure, it was a dot ball, and sure, he was on seven at the time. But there was something about the way he stepped into a straight drive back at Stuart Broad, the feet moving perfectly, the timing crisp with no attempt at power, the line so straight that the bowler bent to scoop up the ball. At the ground where Smith made three international centuries in the previous Australian summer, he looked like Smith looks when he is most switched on. Yet a few hours later, it was Usman Khawaja raising his bat to the cheers of a home crowd. Broad had got the better of Smith for 67, to an uncharacteristic push at a ball that didn’t require one. Khawaja had left the bowling impeccably, defended it resolutely, and taken it on when given the opportunity, in an innings that showed all of the best parts of his game built over the course of his lengthening career.  It was the shortcomings in his game that led to Khawaja spending most of the past two and a half years outside the national team, having been dropped after the third Ashes Test at Headingley in 2019. Khawaja had not had a terrible series batting at first drop, making 40 in an important partnership at Edgbaston and 36 in another at Lord’s. But he hadn’t made a compelling score, and then ran into some bad luck or bad timing. Australia pulled the trigger on the opener Cameron Bancroft early, replacing him with Marcus Harris after two Tests. Marnus Labuschagne impressed in the third Test as Smith’s concussion replacement, and had to be retained when Smith returned. Had Australia given Bancroft one more match, he could either have succeeded and kept his spot, or been replaced by Khawaja moving up the order. But with Harris having played only once, selectors had to keep him for a stint that was ultimately worse than Bancroft’s, while Khawaja returned home to a poor Sheffield Shield season and floated out of the reckoning entirely. Since then the reasonable conclusion has been that Khawaja’s time is done. He turned 35 just before Christmas, while Labuschagne has cemented himself in Khawaja’s old spot at No 3, and Will Pucovski emerged as the young tyro most likely to accompany David Warner’s final years at the top. Warner and Smith are also moving deeper into their 30s and overall the Test team has needed to be refreshed. But just as things change quickly in one direction, they can go quickly in the other. Khawaja had a good half-season, Pucovski was ruled out with another concussion injury, Travis Head returned a positive Covid test, and suddenly there was a spot that needed to be filled, and a job that needed to be done. Khawaja is no stranger to solving problems for Australia. During the one-day World Cup in 2019 he was thrown in at No 5 despite never having batted there in List A cricket. In the current match he was asked to bat there despite never having done so in Tests. By this point of his career the details such as where he bats don’t seem to faze Khawaja. He walked in on the first evening with Australia 117 for three, with trouble looming for the team if he failed, and instead made sure that he didn’t. He first batted through to stumps, then through the first session of the next day with Smith, before assuming the senior role once Smith was gone. Through those hours, and his 260 deliveries, his patience and concentration shone through. At times in his career Khawaja’s innings have been ended by lapses in either. After a long first session with an extra half-hour, as he moved beyond his half-century, he opened up his repertoire of strokes: that lavish cover drive, a back cut, the pull. But they were careful selections for the right occasion, not extravagances for their own sake. Through he went past tea, towards sunset, taking Australia to a point where his eventual dismissal for 137 prompted a charge towards a declaration rather than a rearguard. Of course, there is the question of what is next. But Khawaja before this match said that he was filling in for the match in Head’s spot. He is probably right, with the longer-term holder having been anointed and having made his own match-defining century in Brisbane. Head will return for the fifth Test in Hobart. Khawaja’s assignment was short-term and it has been fulfilled immaculately. It doesn’t need to lead to anything else for it to be a triumph in its own right, a player showing that he still has what it takes years after he stopped getting that chance. Beyond Hobart, Australia will play nine Tests in Asia in the coming year. On his last visit in 2018 Khawaja made his masterpiece 140 to save a Test in Dubai. There is every likelihood that more chances will arise, and Khawaja has shown himself ready.",Sport/Sport,Khawaja’s stand-in century a triumph for Australia’s old problem solver | Geoff Lemon,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/06/khawaja-stand-in-century-a-triumph-for-australias-old-problem-solver-ashes-cricket
1/6/2022,"Dogs may appear to have selective hearing when it comes to commands but research suggests they are paying attention to human chit-chat. Researchers – who arranged for headphone-wearing dogs to listen to excerpts from The Little Prince, a novella – revealed the brains of our canine companions can tell the difference between speech and non-speech when listening to human voices and show different responses to speech in an unfamiliar language.  The team say the findings support other studies that suggest animals may share some human skills. “Our capacities to process speech and languages are not necessarily unique in all the ways we like to think they are,” said Dr Attila Andics, senior author of the study at Eötvös Loránd University in Hungary. The research involved 18 dogs of various ages and breeds which were trained to lie in an MRI scanner without restraint or sedation, but with headphones on. They were then played recordings either of humans reading excerpts from The Little Prince by Antoine De Saint-Exupéry or such speech cut up into small pieces so it sounded unnatural. The results, published in the journal NeuroImage, reveal the dogs’ brains showed a different activity pattern in the primary auditory cortex for speech compared with non-speech, with the findings similar regardless of whether the language used – Hungarian or Spanish – was familiar. Curiously, the longer the dog’s head was, the better their brain could distinguish speech from non-speech. The team also found the activity pattern was stronger for non-speech. “In humans, you typically see stronger response to speech,” Andics told the Guardian, adding it appears a different mechanism is at play in dogs and they are not “tuned in” to speech. “Probably what they detect is that the normal, natural speech sounds natural. And the other one sounds surprising, strange, not the typical pattern we hear,” he said. Andics said it made sense to explore response to human speech in dogs, since they share our environment. But questions remain. “Whether this is something that only dog brains can do or not, or whether dogs indeed became better at detecting speech as a result of certain brain changes during these tens of thousands of years of domestication, we are not sure,” he said. Sophie Scott, professor of cognitive neuroscience at University College London welcomed the research. “[It is a] very nice demonstration of just how much dogs are listening to our voices and how much information they’re pulling out, even if that is not necessarily speech that is directed to them or containing words they might recognise,” she said. “Almost everything that you can find about human speech and human language and you say, ‘ah this is unique to humans’, you find an animal somewhere that can do it.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Dogs may be able to tell difference between speech patterns, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/06/dogs-may-be-able-to-tell-difference-between-speech-patterns-study-finds
