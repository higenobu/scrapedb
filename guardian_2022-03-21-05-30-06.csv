3/21/2022,"Jürgen Klopp had said how his scant knowledge of Nottingham stretched to its association with Robin Hood and until Diogo Jota poked in the winning goal 12 minutes from time to propel Liverpool into the FA Cup semi-finals he was at risk of being on the wrong end of an upset that would have provided him an unwanted memory. Forest proved courageous and stubborn, leading Klopp to make a quadruple substitution midway through a stale second half, and could have taken the had Philip Zinckernagel tucked home a golden chance. Liverpool, who remain on course for an unprecedented quadruple, will take on Manchester City in the final four. Steve Cooper made a low-key entrance a few minutes before kick-off, strolling out of the tunnel and raising his right hand to acknowledge the adoring Forest support before taking a seat in the home dugout. Cooper, who spent five years coaching Liverpool’s academy, has revitalised Forest since inheriting a team that was bottom of the Championship. He could be forgiven for wanting to take it all in. Giant tifos were unfurled in the Trent End and even Cooper applauded the rousing pre-match rendition of Forest’s anthem: Mull of Kintyre. “Our desire is always to be here,” read a graphic stretched across the lower tier. At the opposite end, in a pocket of the Bridgford Stand adjacent to the away fans, there was a poignant tribute to those who lost their lives in the Hillsborough disaster. “97 Never Forgotten” read a banner that covered 97 vacant seats. The pre-match atmosphere provided the perfect tonic for a breathless first 45 minutes. Forest supporters gasped as Brennan Johnson made the first in-roads down the left flank and the volume increased further when Zinckernagel pinched the ball inside the Liverpool box. His cross was deflected across the six-yard box and fell to the lively Joe Lolley but his cut-back was cleared by Naby Keïta, one of seven Liverpool changes from their victory over Arsenal. Manchester City v Liverpool Chelsea v Crystal Palace The ties to be played at Wembley on 16/17 April. Lolley sent a shot whistling wide and a couple of minutes later he skipped past Keïta on the touchline to kickstart another counterattack. In the second half, another Johnson burst lured Joe Gomez into a clumsy challenge that earned the Liverpool full-back a booking. Trent Alexander-Arnold and Mohamed Salah were absent through injury, while Sadio Manè was given a breather by Klopp to help aid his preparation for Senegal’s World Cup play-off against Salah’s Egypt. Keïta was arguably Liverpool’s weakest link during a first half in which they created numerous chances, the best of which Roberto Firmino squandered. Firmino was slipped in on goal after Liverpool intercepted the left-back Jack Colback’s pass but, faced one on one with the Forest goalkeeper Ethan Horvath, the Brazilian forward was guilty of overcomplicating things. Firmino tried to lob Horvath but the goalkeeper read the situation. Kostas Tsimikas went close with a swerving shot from 25 yards and Gomez, having powered forward on the opposite flank, sent a flying shot over on the brink of the interval. Fabinho, one of four to keep his place, pulled a shot wide after a flat corner caught Forest cold. The Forest captain, Joe Worrall, also made an expert sliding tackle on Jota just as the Liverpool forward appeared set to take aim. Jota’s strike provided a cruel reminder of Liverpool’s clinical edge. A couple of minutes after Zinckernagel prodded wide after another fine foray forward by Johnson, whose teasing ball in from the right dropped towards the penalty spot, Jota converted Tsimikas’s floated cross. It was almost as if Cooper was telepathic. He swivelled and winced in the technical area as Tsimikas snatched the ball. But Liverpool did not cruise over the finish line. With the clock ticking Johnson beat Tsimikas and picked out Ryan Yates, but the Forest midfielder headed straight at Alisson.",Sport/Football,Liverpool earn Manchester City FA Cup semi after Jota edges out Forest,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/20/nottingham-forest-liverpool-fa-cup-match-report
3/21/2022,"Good morning. Ukrainian officials have accused Moscow of forcibly deporting thousands of people from Mariupol to Russia, as Turkey says a peace deal between the two countries is close. In Australia, Peter Malinauskas is due to be sworn in as South Australia’s new premier, and paramedics are set to take industrial action in New South Wales. Forced civilian deportations from Mariupol to Russia are “disturbing” and “unconscionable” if true, the United States has said, after Ukrainian officials accused Moscow of transporting thousands of people against their will out of the devastated port city. Though Turkey’s foreign minister has claimed a peace deal between the two countries is “close”, skepticism among western countries about Putin’s intentions remains. Meanwhile, Germany has agreed a contract with Qatar for the supply of liquefied natural gas (LNG) that will help the European country wean itself off its dependency on Russian energy. In Australia, the government has banned the sale of alumina and aluminium ores to Russia in response to what it described as “unrelenting and illegal aggression” towards Ukraine. On Sunday, the prime minister Scott Morrison announced Australia would donate coal and further military equipment to Ukraine to “support the brave and courageous resistance” as part of a new aid package that also includes $30m in emergency humanitarian assistance. The SA election result should have Morrison’s Coalition “trembling” ahead of the federal poll, Labor says, after Malinauskas became the first opposition leader to defeat an incumbent government since the start of the pandemic. The outgoing premier, Steven Marshall, announced on Sunday he would step down as Liberal leader after the landslide loss to Labor, saying he “takes full responsibility for the result” and accepts “the will of the people”. The prime minister sought to downplay what the resounding Labor win in SA could mean on a federal level, saying Anthony Albanese doesn’t match up to his state colleagues. Fifty-one asylum seekers who were brought to Australia for medical treatment continue to languish in detention in Australia, including 18 in the Park hotel in Melbourne, with no indication of when they might be released, according to a prominent refugee support group. Soaring commodity prices and a shrinking jobless rate will combine to slice almost $90bn from projected federal budget deficits out to 2024-25, although excessive pre-election promises would undermine the government’s fiscal repair efforts, according to Chris Richardson, a senior economist at Deloitte. A toxic chemical released from tyres as they wear down on roads and implicated in mass deaths of salmon in the US has been found in an Australian waterway for the first time. Teachers at Brisbane religious school Citipointe Christian College are being asked to sign employment contracts that warn they could be sacked for being openly homosexual. The US is likely to see an increase in Covid cases like that in Europe and the UK thanks to the BA.2 virus subvariant but not a dangerous surge, Anthony Fauci said on Sunday. Worshippers at a mosque in Toronto subdued an allegedly axe-wielding man who police say attacked people with bear spray during a dawn prayer service. Police investigating the death of Sabita Thanwani, 19, at a student flat in London over the weekend have arrested a man. Ministers in the UK are looking “sympathetically” at plans to stop the government buying health goods made in China’s Xinjiang province when the health and social care bill returns to the House of Commons later this month. The move would be a first sign that the UK government is willing to toughen its approach to authoritarian regimes in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine. A commitment to fly the Aboriginal flag permanently atop the Sydney Harbour Bridge was the pinnacle of relentless campaigning by Cheree Toka, a young Kamilaroi woman. “I looked up as we were driving over the bridge and saw the Aboriginal flag wasn’t there – just the NSW and Australian flags,” Toka tells Guardian Australia. “I remember getting riled and saying to my friends ‘this country is so messed up sometimes’.” There are so many things to learn and so much knowledge that seems to be embedded in your bones when caring for children. Some skills and approach to child-rearing comes from a visceral instinct and there are thousands of books and social media accounts that offer advice and doctrines about how to do it right. But there are a few things that Emily Mulligan wishes someone had told her. Here, she shares her hard-earned wisdom. Over four novels, the award-winning Australian author Steven Carroll has picked apart TS Eliot and his relationships with women – but felt moved to give the poet’s first wife Vivienne a happier end. On paper, the company does not exist: there is no company registration for the Wagner Group, no tax returns, no recruitment office. Officially, private military companies remain illegal in Russia. But those who have followed the group’s activities since its founding in 2014 – when it was used to support pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine – say that after successful incursions in Syria and several countries in Africa, it is now playing an important role in Russia’s war in Ukraine. Pjotr Sauer has reported on the Wagner Group for the Guardian and he recently interviewed Marat Gabidullin, a former mercenary who joined the group in 2015. He tells Nosheen Iqbal that Wagner is an unofficial foreign policy tool of the Kremlin.

3/21/2022,"The derby game in Argentina’s top flight between Rosario Central and Newell’s Old Boys kicked off late on Sunday after “a number of grenades”, which had been thrown on to the field by fans, blew holes in the playing surface. The fixture, a local derby between two fierce rivals in the Santa Fe province, is one of the major dates in the country’s football calendar. On Thursday evening, 30,000 Newell’s fans gathered at their club’s stadium where there was a firework display to give the team a send off ahead of Sunday’s game.

3/21/2022,"Hundreds of people gathered at Hackney town hall in east London on Sunday to express solidarity with the family of Child Q, the 15-year-old black girl who was subjected to a traumatic strip search by police at her school. The protesters, many of whom were mothers accompanied by their daughters, carried placards with messages including “Stop violating black girls” and Black Lives Matter banners, and expressed anger at what they said was an “abuse of power” by the police as well as teachers at Child Q’s school. In a powerful speech that catalogued many recent abuses of women by police, Diane Abbott, the MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, said: “What we are seeing is a pattern of police abuse of power in relation to women, particularly black women.” Abbott catalogued several incidents in London, including the racist and sexist language used by officers at Charing Cross station, the officers who took pictures of murdered sisters Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman at the murder scene which they then passed around WhatsApp groups, and the strip search of a young woman, Dr Konstancja Duff, at Stoke Newington police station in 2013. “It took her nine years to get compensation and she can’t be the only woman the police have treated that way,” Abbott told the 700-strong crowd. “And now we come to what happened to that poor child that we are showing solidarity with today. How could there be a more degrading way to treat a schoolchild?” Sunday’s protest was one of several since news of the schoolgirl’s treatment was revealed and public anger over the report into Child Q has been fuelled by viral social media posts, especially on TikTok. Bhatt Murphy, the solicitors acting on behalf of Child Q, pleaded with the public to help maintain her anonymity. They said reporting restrictions prohibit “publication of her identity, the identity of any member of her family, and the identity of the school where the search took place”. Despite this, millions of people have viewed videos on TikTok – many of them made by fellow teenagers – naming one school as being responsible for the strip search and featuring footage of protests on the institution’s premises. A spokesperson for TikTok said it was looking into the issue and whether any rules had been broken by the videos. At Sunday’s protest, many of the speakers were cheered and clapped as they called for action and accountability on behalf of Child Q’s family. At one point, the Hackney mayor, Philip Glanville, was drowned out by shouts of “Action, action speaks louder than words, they must go” when he spoke about delivering “real change”. Activist Maria Larasi said: “I was a teacher. You can’t tell me that they smelled ganja on a child and there wasn’t procedure. This is sexual abuse. Let’s call it right.” Althea Lewis, 41, a mother of three daughters, said she had come to show solidarity with Child Q’s family and to express her anger at what had happened. She said: “I grew up in Hackney and I have lived experience of how young black students have been treated. Nothing has changed. The fact that this happened is absolutely soul-destroying.” Lewis, a therapist who works with young people, said: “This is a child who would come to me for treatment after this trauma. There should be action taken against the school. Staff cannot continue to be ignorant as to what their safeguarding duties are. The fact that staff at the school thought this was OK means they should not be around children.” One of Lewis’s daughters, Tia, 20, said: “I’ve had to deal with things at school where there is a lack of respect for you when you are a black woman. They think you are older than you are. We are made to feel we can’t get help or reach out. What happened to this child – the same age as my sister – was disgusting and they got away with it for two years with no action.” Yasmin Dawes, 23, an actor and teaching assistant from Tower Hamlets, said: “Young black girls are robbed of their innocence, their childhoods. Blackness is hyper-masculinised, hyper-sexualised. We are not afforded the luxury of innocence.” “To me, this is unfathomable, that a teacher allowed this to happen. The teachers need to be gone, 100%, and the police, 100%.” Sasha McBean, 35, a psychotherapeutic counsellor and mother from Brixton, said: “Not only was this an invasion of this young girl’s personal space and body, it altered the way she saw herself. We need to focus on what we can do to support these young girls who have been through this. “It can never happen again.”",News/UK news,‘It can never happen again’: hundreds gather in support of Child Q,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/20/it-can-never-happen-again-hundreds-gather-in-support-of-child-q
