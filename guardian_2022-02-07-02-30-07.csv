2/7/2022,"My friend Andy Ross, who has died aged 65 after treatment for cancer, was a hugely respected music industry executive. He worked with some of the biggest names in the business and was instrumental in the famous Blur vs Oasis chart battle in the 1990s, when the Britpop bands released new singles on the same day in a race for the No 1 slot. The elder son of Ian Ross, a draughtsman in the oil industry, and Marlene (nee Bates, now Williamson), a secretary at the London Management entertainment company, Andy was born in Upper Norwood, south London, and gained a scholarship to Dulwich college. He and I met in 1977 in Leicester, where he was studying social and economic history at the university, while I was at the poly. His band the Disco Zombies were looking for a singer and I was looking for a band.  We became enthusiastic sparring partners, champions of sarcasm and irony, Andy utilising his skills as a mimic to amuse. We moved to London and he got a job in a record shop in Forest Hill, quickly followed by a stint as manager of the bookies next door. He launched the indie label South Circular Records with our single Drums Over London in 1978; his lyrics way too clever for our own good. Andy was obsessed with music, always enthusiastic for something new, and could spot a tune from the briefest of listens. He wrote under the pseudonym Andy Hurt and joined me in the mid-80s at Sounds magazine, where he excelled in punning and later invented the phrase “shoegazing” to describe bands who stared at their feet rather than the audience. He was introduced to (the ex-Teardrop Explodes member) Dave Balfe, who recognised Andy’s understanding of how songs work and partnered with him in 1986 in Food Records, which became one of the biggest “indie” labels of its time. They then did a groundbreaking deal with EMI and had huge success with artists such as Jesus Jones, Diesel Park West, Shampoo, Dubstar and Idlewild. Most famously, Andy discovered Blur in March 1990, after seeing them play the Powerhaus in Islington the previous November – he persuaded them to change their name from Seymour to Blur. The band would go on to sell millions of records worldwide. The label released 100 consecutive top 100 singles, an outstanding achievement, and their roster achieved many No 1 records and awards. Andy loved the art of the song, and his advice and pontifications on how they should sound inspired a host of bands. He stayed with Food until EMI/Parlophone took full control in 2000. In the early days of the label he met Helen Potter, and they had a wonderful 30-year relationship, enjoying travelling as well as socialising with their huge circle of friends. The Disco Zombies had reunited in recent years and we played our last show at the Dublin Castle pub in Camden in 2018, a little older, none the wiser. Andy was also involved in band management, enjoyed football and quizzes – he even appeared on Only Connect – and had a show on Boogaloo Radio in north London. He is survived by Helen, whom he married in 2004, his parents, and his brother, Simon.",News/Business,Andy Ross obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/06/andy-ross-obituary
2/7/2022,"The serial killer Levi Bellfield has reportedly penned a letter confessing to the murders of mother and daughter Lin and Megan Russell in 1996. The Sun revealed that lawyers acting for Michael Stone, who has twice been found guilty of the murders of Lin and Megan in Kent, have claimed to have received a statement written by Bellfield detailing the killings.  Lin and her daughters, six-year-old Megan and nine-year-old Josie, were attacked in Chillenden before being bound, blindfolded and bludgeoned with a claw hammer. Stone was convicted of two counts of murder and one of attempted murder in 1998, and again in 2001 after the court of appeal quashed his conviction due to doubts over a prosecution witness. An application to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), the miscarriage of justice watchdog, was rejected in 2010. But the CCRC is considering an application from Stone after fresh evidence emerged, including a shoelace from the crime scene found in police storage in 2020, which Stone’s lawyers say could provide crucial DNA evidence. In response to reports that Bellfield had confessed to the Russell murders, the CCRC said it was aware that Stone’s lawyers were “planning to send in further information”. A CCRC spokesperson said: “Mr Stone’s current application to the CCRC is being reviewed and we remain in regular contact with his legal representatives. We are aware they are planning to send in further information, and when received, we will thoroughly analyse it and make any appropriate enquiries. We will not be commenting further at this stage.” Bellfield is serving a whole-life order for the murder of 13-year-old Milly Dowler, who in 2002 went missing from Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, as well as the murders of Marsha McDonnell and Amelie Delagrange, and of the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy. A comprehensive investigation has previously been carried out by the Metropolitan police into allegations that Bellfield was involved in the Russell murders. It concluded there was no evidence to support the claims. Det Ch Supt Paul Fotheringham of Kent police said: “Following two trials at which Stone was found guilty by a jury on both occasions, and an appeal to the high court, Michael Stone remains convicted of the murders of Lin and Megan Russell, and the attempted murder of Josie Russell in 1996. “Michael Stone made an application to apply for a judicial review in respect of his conviction in September 2012. The honourable Mr Justice Blake ordered that permission for the application should be refused. “The [CCRC] commenced an extensive re-examination of the murder investigation in 2017 and has had access to all forensic evidence, documentation and exhibits from the original investigation, the review by Hampshire constabulary, details of the two crown court trials and appeals to the high court. “The shoelace which was seized as part of the original investigation was made available to the CCRC. All evidence from the examinations on the shoelace were recorded and disclosed to the CCRC.”",News/UK news,"Levi Bellfield admits to murdering Lin and Megan Russell, say lawyers",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/06/levi-bellfield-admits-to-murdering-lin-and-megan-russell-say-lawyers
2/7/2022,"You thought of him as a big-haired, Hawaiian-shirted master of one-liners. But it turns out, or so tonight’s story goes, that Milton Jones once worked as a spy. And maybe that makes sense – as much, at least, as anything else in this hour of brain-warping cartoon-comedy. Jones is clearly some kind of undercover agent in real life, eavesdropping on the English language and its infinite flexibilities while the rest of us merely use it. And exposure to his word- and mind-play is as destabilising as anything Le Carré threw at us. Nothing he says can be trusted. Nothing is at it seems. In Milton Impossible, I found the experience – failing to second-guess the punchlines, enjoying the actual punchlines (so much better than I anticipated!) – delightful. The twisty little lexical tricks just keep coming, one figure-of-speech after another (“I don’t know how some people sleep at night”; “Remove cardboard sleeve and film”) plunging into the vacuum left after Jones tugs their foundations out from under them. One begins, dizzily, to doubt that any of our linguistic certainties are secure against his subversion – until Jones changes the rhythm, with an interrogation scene played out with two collapsible legs and a rotating chair, say, or a series of gnomic dialogues between UN member states.  The latter enables a rare flash of satire from Jones, as the EU’s simple question about Brexit (“how do you think it’s all going?”) elicits a very testy British response. More often, whatever Jones really thinks about the world is deeply buried in whimsy, as he strings together puns, sound effects and on-screen visual gags into an account of his wayward career in espionage. Before the show’s rather abrupt ending, that secret service tale is tenuous in the extreme, even more so than on previous occasions when Jones has jerry-built a narrative framework for his gags. But no matter – the tenuousness is part of the fun. And the fun is abundant in a show that springs surprises from the blandest phrases and parades one bizarre image after another before your mind’s eye. He makes an unlikely spy – but you’ll leave Smiley.

2/7/2022,"Over half of paramedics are suffering from burnout caused by “overwhelming” workloads, record numbers of 999 calls and the public misusing the ambulance service, a study has found. Frontline crew members also blame lack of meal breaks, delays in reaching seriously ill patients and their shift often not ending when it should for their high levels of stress and anxiety.  Ambulance staff’s working lives are so difficult that nine out of 10 display symptoms of “depersonalisation”, characterised by “cynicism, detachment and reduced levels of empathy” when dealing with patients who need urgent medical treatment. The widespread poor mental welfare of paramedics is a problem for the NHS because it is leading to some quitting, and thus exacerbating its shortage of ambulance personnel, the authors said. The findings, published in the Journal of Paramedic Practice, have prompted concern that the demands on crews, alongside the injury, violence and death they encounter, are storing up serious mental health problems for them, including post-traumatic stress disorder. The research is based on responses from 382 crew members who work for an unnamed NHS regional ambulance service in the north of England. “Ambulance staff are passionate about their role. However, burnout is a significant and very real issue that decreases staff efficacy and reduces quality of patient care,” the study said. It was undertaken by Rachel Beldon, who works for the Yorkshire ambulance service, and Joanne Garside, a professor and school strategic director of Huddersfield university’s health and wellbeing academy. “Participants wanted better resources and staffing levels. The current workload appeared to be overwhelming and negatively affected their mental health and work-life balance.” Many ambulance crew also have negative feelings about their bosses, do not feel valued and “some felt they were thought of as ‘dots on a screen’ rather than people”, the paper said. The findings come as 999 calls hit record levels and concern is rising about unprecedented numbers of patients getting trapped in the back of ambulances outside hospitals because A&E staff are too busy to admit them. Two major reports last year said delayed handovers were a factor in thousands of patient deaths a year. One paramedic, who recently described ambulance crews’ working lives in an article in the Guardian, said the findings captured the realities of responding to 999 calls. “Workload is massive. You could have just dealt with a very complicated job and need a few minutes to gather your thoughts but that time is never allowed as the control centre is constantly harassing you. “Burnout affects the quality of care patients receive because staff are exhausted generally and only get a 30-minute break during an eight-hour shift, so become grumpy and make poor decisions and that is reflected in poor patient care.” Sara Gorton, the head of health at the union Unison, said: “Excessive hours without proper breaks, shifts over-running, and queueing for hours outside hospitals has become commonplace for many ambulance staff. Some are regularly reduced to tears by the overwhelming pressures. “The government’s failure to fund services properly has left them with too few staff and emergency vehicles. “Demand is so extreme that paramedics have no time to offload about their many challenging experiences. Long-term exposure to this level of stress could lead to serious mental illness. Staff shouldn’t be left to suffer emotional damage just for doing their jobs.” A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: “We recognise the pressure this pandemic has put on all NHS staff. “To help relieve these pressures, NHS England and Improvement has given ambulance trusts an extra £55m to boost staff numbers for winter, providing over 700 additional staff in control rooms and on the frontline, alongside £1.75m to support the wellbeing of frontline ambulance staff.”",News/Society,"More than half of NHS paramedics suffering from burnout, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/06/more-than-half-of-nhs-paramedics-suffering-from-burnout-study-finds
2/7/2022,"The chairman of Britain’s biggest supermarket chain has warned that “the worst is yet to come” on food price inflation, as he predicted it will soon hit 5%. John Allan, who has chaired Tesco since 2015, told the BBC’s Sunday Morning programme that he was well aware people on very tight budgets were having to choose between food and heating. He said the idea that this was happening was very troubling.  Overall inflation currently stands at 5.4%, a 30-year high, and is predicted to top 6% in the spring, just one element of the cost of living crisis facing UK households. Poverty groups have warned about the impending threat to those on the lowest incomes. “In some ways the worst is still to come – because although food price inflation in Tesco last quarter was only 1%, we are impacted by rising energy prices. Our suppliers are impacted by rising energy prices. We’re doing all we can to offset it … but that’s the sort of number we’re talking about. Of course, 5%,” he said. Allan admitted some people would “of course” have less to spend on luxuries, as the price hikes coincide with a rise in national insurance contributions and the £693 increase in the average family’s annual energy bill, to £1,971, both of which come into effect in April. But he said grocers and suppliers were not immune to rising energy costs. A report this week from the British Retail Consortium said food inflation accelerated to 2.7% in January, up from 2.4% in December. Rising prices prompted the Bank of England to raise interest rates to 0.5% on Thursday, the same day the energy bill rise was announced and the chancellor unveiled a support package for households. Allan said: “I think the combination of increasing energy prices, the impact of national insurance increases on people’s incomes, and to a much much lesser extent increasing food prices, is going to squeeze the hardest-up still harder.” The former chair of the CBI also defended Tesco against claims from food poverty activist Jack Monroe that the costs of basic staples were rising faster than other goods. Allan said he could not speak for the rest of the industry, but said it was untrue at Tesco. “Price rises depend on individual products. Coffee is going up, but other things like the cheapest tin of baked beans in Tesco is cheaper than it was five years ago,” he said. In January, Tesco announced booming Christmas sales and said it expected profits could top £2.6bn, higher than predicted in previous guidance.",News/Business,Chairman warns of food price inflation at 5%,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/06/tesco-chair-warns-food-price-inflation-of-5-is-just-around-the-corner
2/7/2022,"If talk in Edinburgh’s overflowing bars on Saturday evening was turning to thoughts of a long-overdue Six Nations title tilt, those tasked with guiding the next stage of Scotland’s journey were understandably keen to sound a note of caution. It is only 12 months since the Scots enjoyed a similarly giddy opening-day triumph against England at Twickenham, a far more comprehensive win than the 11-6 scoreline suggested.  A week later Gregor Towsend’s charges led Wales 17-3 at Murrayfield before a combination of a disallowed try, a red card for Zander Fagerson and Louis Rees-Zammitt’s sensational finishing punctured all that early optimism in an agonising one-point defeat. After the helter-skelter Calcutta Cup victory on Saturday a wounded Wales, thoroughly outclassed by a dominant Ireland in Dublin, again provide the next hurdle to those ambitions of a credible challenge. Scotland may have won at an empty Parc y Scarlets in Llanelli during the Covid-delayed conclusion to the 2020 championship to end an 18-year losing run in Wales, but they have not won on their past 10 visits to the Principality Stadium – including eight in the Championship. “It’s one of the best places to play in the world and I hope there are some Scots booking trains and tickets because we could do with a few thousand supporters cheering us on,” said Townsend, who was part of the last Scotland side to win at the Cardiff citadel in 2002. “We know the atmosphere will be immense and for the Welsh team, and Ireland haven’t done us any favours by getting them fired up. Wales are a great Six Nations team, they will learn a lot from their first game and they will be up for it, like we will. We just have to deliver a better performance and we know we will need to next week.” Townsend was in the highly unusual position coming into this championship of having all his frontline players available, in contrast to England and Wales, who will again be severely depleted. That has changed in at least one regard with Jamie Ritchie, one of the side’s vice-captains and widely regarded as Stuart Hogg’s most likely long-term successor, expected to miss the trip to Cardiff and possibly more as he awaits the diagnosis of an injury to his hamstring/groin area. “When you’re on crutches and struggling to walk, it’s not looking great for Jamie just now; he’s in a lot of pain,” Townsend said of a player who has only missed one of Scotland’s 18 Tests since the 2019 World Cup – that home defeat by Wales last year. His absence will be a significant blow, but Townsend does have alternatives, if not a like-for-like option. The in-form Magnus Bradbury, who replaced Ritchie for the final quarter on Saturday, would bring extra ball-carrying heft to the party, while Sam Skinner, who came on at lock, has started at blindside for Scotland in the past. Given the loss of Ritchie’s breakdown expertise, though, this might be the time to bring the “exceptional” – Townsend’s description – Glasgow openside Rory Darge into the matchday 23. Despite showing buckets of character and defensive resolve, allied to some clinical moments in attack, this was not one of Scotland’s finest performances, and yet it still proved good enough to beat an England side who enjoyed the lion’s share of possession and territory. Townsend’s charges only really asserted themselves over a sustained period in the final quarter – aided by some forceful contributions from the bench and Finn Russell brilliantly dissecting the weak spots in England’s defence which led to the momentum-turning penalty try conceded by Luke Cowan-Dickie. “I thought Finn was outstanding,” said Townsend, who assumed the fly-half would be named player of the match, only for the award to go to the No 8 Matt Fagerson, who manned the barricades superbly with 16 tackles in a bruising close-quarters battle. “Matt had a very good game, he was very strong in contact,” the head coach acknowledged. “But to play stand-off up in the heat of the defence, when England were coming up quickly and trying to put a lot of pressure on Finn, in those conditions I thought his decision-making was spot-on, and nailing his goal-kicks was crucial for us.” There were other standout contributions – the wing Darcy Graham was a constant thorn in red rose flesh, while Hogg again played a reassuring and composed captain’s hand. “If we are brutally honest, we didn’t show exactly what we are about, and I am quite excited about how far this group can go,” the full-back said. “We’re not going to get carried away but it’s definitely an exciting time to be part of this team. When we watch this game back, we will see areas we can improve on, which excites me. Wales are one of the best sides in world rugby and especially at home, so it is going to be one hell of a challenge next week but one we are ready for.”",Sport/Sport,Scotland coach Gregor Townsend warns team to beware wounded Wales ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/06/scotland-coach-gregor-townsend-warns-team-to-beware-wounded-wales
2/7/2022,"Amid all the discussion about how to mitigate the cost of energy price rises for households (Report, 3 February), there has been no mention of how to cut energy use in the first place. Rather than offset the cost by discounts, the money would be better used to reduce long-term energy consumption by making buildings as energy-efficient as possible and thereby helping to meet climate change commitments, too. It’s not rocket science. We can go a long way to improve the situation by ensuring lofts are insulated, windows are double-glazed and fit correctly, letterbox holes are plugged and external mailboxes fitted instead, draught excluders are fitted around wooden front doors, curtains have thermal linings etc.  There are millions of Victorian terrace houses that have chilly external walls; simple internal battening and insulation can make a huge difference for a loss in internal space of only about 8cm. We need local councils to take the lead in instigating these works in partnership with voluntary organisations and householders and show what can be done. Just making thermal cameras available to borrow would be a good start. Also, building regulations need to be radically updated. We are still building homes with pathetic insulation despite many of them being labelled “sustainable” – what a joke.Diana WilkinsBristol  Why have we not learned that privatising essential services is the wrong way to go? Energy companies, which have been happily pocketing their profits for decades, are now faced with a situation that they apparently could not anticipate and did not plan for, and suddenly they want to pass on the costs and consequences of their lack of foresight and basic business acumen to us longsuffering consumers. As essential service suppliers, these companies should focus on maintaining and improving their services, not on raking in huge profits while failing to plan for the future and then crying foul and bumping up their tariffs. We should shut the lot of them down and renationalise energy services with immediate effect.Andrew KnowlesManchester  It seems the government’s plan to alleviate the coming financial crisis caused by the massive rise in fuel prices will actually be a way to increase inequality. Everyone will have a £200 rebate, from the poorest to the richest. Council tax receipts for the most cash-strapped councils will reduce the most, as they have the fewest houses in the highest tax brackets. Surely the simplest way to direct help to those who need it most would be to reinstate the £20 uplift that was removed from universal credit in the autumn. In fact, increase it to £25.Hilary LangFrome, Somerset  Re your report (3 February) on more energy price increases to come in the autumn, compare this with Energy de France (EDF) – around 70% of its energy is nuclear and profits are limited by the government and used to keep prices low.

2/7/2022,"Your report (4 February) on the rise in mental health problems among children was an incredibly important insight into the challenges they are facing. But for children and young people who have been in care, the situation is even more dire. Looked-after children are already at significantly higher risk of experiencing poor mental health than their peers. Despite there only being 67 children in care for every 10,000, these individuals make up 24% of the prison population and 25% of the homeless population in the UK. What’s more, as stated in a recent report by the children’s rights campaign Hope Instead of Handcuffs, young people who have spent time in care are significantly more likely than their peers to find themselves classified as not in education, employment or training.  We have yet to see fully how these statistics will be impacted by the pandemic. But for “care-experienced” children, who often don’t have the same support networks as their peers, the months of isolation are likely to have exacted a heavy toll. Any policies to improve mental health among young people must provide specific provision for those in care. We cannot keep allowing them to slip through the cracks and have poorer life outcomes just because they have spent time in care.Sarah ChampionLabour MP, Rotherham  Your report highlights the worrying effects of the Covid lockdowns. But it is also a symptom of 12 years of underfunding of child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs), which have been overwhelmed for many years. This leads to crisis management for life-threatening situations, and leaves many children with worsening symptoms without support. Domestic violence and parental mental illness play a big part in causing children to suffer emotionally. These factors will only increase as the cost-of-living crisis, cuts to universal credit and higher energy bills pile more pressure on struggling, vulnerable families. The government must provide more financial and social support to families if it is serious about protecting children and young people.Steven WalkerFormer Camhs lead, Anglia Ruskin University  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Downstairs on buses could serve passengers with masks, upstairs for those without. At supermarkets some tills could be reserved for queues of customers with masks.

2/7/2022,"The Morrison government will restore ABC funding to 2018 levels, when Malcolm Turnbull imposed an $84m indexation pause, with the public broadcaster to be given $3.3bn for the next three years. The communications minister, Paul Fletcher, has also announced SBS will receive $953.7m, including an additional $37.5m in ongoing funding to support its long-term sustainability, as part of the government’s response to the media reform green paper.  The triennium funding package includes $45.8m for the ABC’s enhanced news gathering program to continue public interest journalism in regional communities. “We’ve delivered an increase in funding for both national broadcasters compared to both the 2016-19 and 2019-22 funding period,” Fletcher said. “This funding commitment is designed to provide certainty for both broadcasters and is being announced well in advance of the next funding period to assist the ABC and SBS to develop their forward plans.” While funding remains stable between 2023 and 2026, the government will impose new reporting conditions on both public broadcasters. Statements of expectation will ask them to detail the levels of Australian content, and other key services. The ABC’s managing director David Anderson welcomed what he called “funding certainty”. “The $3.3bn over the next triennium, announced by the Minister Paul Fletcher, sees the resumption of indexation, the continuation of the Enhanced Newsgathering (ENG) program that provides vital services across the country, and ongoing support for audio description services for blind or visually impaired audiences,” he said. “ENG funding has delivered more tailored news to local communities and has seen the ABC invest more in specialist resources that provide vital context and analysis about issues that matter to all Australians.” ABC chair Ita Buttrose said she was “delighted” with the government’s funding decision. “It will allow the national broadcaster to continue doing what it does best – provide information and entertainment to Australians wherever they live,” she said. The Morrison government also announced a number of measures for media reform, including a scheme to make streaming services like Netflix invest at least 5% of their profits in Australian content and an extension of support for regional broadcasters and public interest journalism. Between 4,000 and 5,000 editorial roles have been lost since 2010 and “many regional and remote communities no longer have a local journalist present and do not receive coverage of local issues and events”, the media policy statement said. “This trend of service contractions and job losses accelerated through Covid, with some estimates suggesting that at least 1,000 journalists lost their jobs due to closures of smaller independent publications in 2020.” To support regional journalism a new journalist fund will also provide $10m over two years to support the hiring of cadet journalists in regional newsrooms. Screen Producers Australia has argued for a 20% quota of Australian content on streaming services as audiences have moved away from free-to-air television towards streaming on demand. “Australia is not alone in grappling with the challenge of safeguarding access to content with local cultural relevance in an increasingly globalised marketplace,” the paper on regulating streaming said. “A number of countries have implemented regulations on streaming services to incentivise or require the provision of local programming.”Guardian Australia reported last week that the majority of Australians would support restoring funding to the ABC after new figures showed it had been cut by $526m since the Coalition’s first budget.",News/Media,ABC welcomes ‘funding certainty’ as Morrison government responds to media reform paper,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/07/abc-welcomes-funding-certainty-as-morrison-government-responds-to-media-reform-paper
2/7/2022,"The Sex Work Decriminalisation Act 2021 is set to be debated in Victoria’s parliament this week. The bill will repeal offences for consensual sex work, strengthen anti-discrimination protections for workers and allow the industry to be regulated using existing laws that apply to all other Victorian businesses.  Here’s a closer look at the legislation. Sex work is currently regulated under a legalised model, meaning it is only lawful if it takes place under conditions set out in the Sex Work Act 1994. Providers who operate a brothel or an escort agency, as well as sex workers who work independently, are required to obtain a licence to operate lawfully. All sex work that occurs outside this system, including street-based work, is unlawful. Sex Work Law Reform Victoria said the current model has created a “two-tiered industry”, with about 80% of workers operating outside the law. “The most disadvantaged sex workers, particularly migrant sex workers, gender diverse sex workers, they’re the ones that are usually in that illegal underground area and the consequences of that is many feel they are not able to report unfair work practices and crimes to police,” spokesperson, Matthew Roberts, said. For those workers operating legally, their details are permanently kept on a register, which can affect future employment prospects, show up on police checks and even interfere with custody cases. A 2019 review led by Fiona Patten, a Victorian upper house MP and former sex worker, recommended a full decriminalisation of the industry. “This bill reflects the recommendations of that review and essentially what it does is it treats sex work the same as any other work,” she said. “It is 40 years in the making.” Patten said the bill is “uniquely Victorian” but takes elements from legislation in the Northern Territory and New South Wales, where sex work was decriminalised in 2019 and 1995 respectively. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning There are two stages. The first stage, which comes into effect in March, removes offences for consensual sex work, including those that relate to street-based work and public health. A new protected attribute of “profession, trade or occupation” is added to the Equal Opportunity Act and a clause making it lawful to refuse accommodation to a sex worker is removed. A new offence prevents street-based sex work from occurring at or near schools, childcare services and places of worship between 6am and 7pm and on holy days. The second stage of the bill, to come into effect in December 2023, dismantles the sex work licensing and registration framework by repealing the Sex Work Act in full. This means the industry will be regulated through standard planning, occupational health and safety and other regulations that apply to all businesses in Victoria. An updated definition of “commercial sexual services” is also inserted into the Crimes Act 1958, as are certain offences relating to children and coercion. The bill also orders the changes be reviewed no later than five years after stage two commences, with findings to be tabled in parliament. Sex worker groups were consulted throughout the process and are largely supportive. Roberts said the changes to discrimination laws were especially “life changing”. “Sex workers at the moment experience rampant discrimination in all aspects of their life in banking, finance, accommodation, university or education settings, employment settings. If a sex worker wants to move out of the industry and find a job … there’s also discrimination there,” Roberts said.

This particular amendment … will provide sex workers with that option.” Jules Kim, CEO of Scarlet Alliance, the national organisation for sex workers, pointed to a 2020 study conducted with the Centre for Social Research that found 96% of workers had experienced discrimination in the past 12 months. “The bill will go a long way in addressing these issues and improving our access to work health and safety, our access to redress in the same ways that other workers are able to,” she said. Animal Justice party MP Andy Meddick wants several amendments to the legislation, including the new offence preventing street work occurring at certain times or locations scrapped as it “directly contradicts the government’s stated intentions of making sex work safer”. Kim said the offence means sex workers will continue to be “harassed, surveilled, arrested and fined by the police”. Meddick is also seeking to amend the legislation to include a best practice definition of “sex work” and “sex worker”. The only definition in the bill is that being added to the Crimes Act and references drugs as a possible form of payment. Kim said it was “unnecessarily broad” and not a feature of the NT or NSW legislation. Meddick is also calling on the government to specify “sex work” and “sex workers” in the changes to the discrimination laws, ensure that Australia’s national advertising standards applies to sex workers and abolish the register, given it will no longer be used. The state government spokesperson said the register records will be destroyed in accordance with the requirements of the Public Records Act 1973. She said the definition of “commercial sexual services” has been broadened to capture different types of benefit, payment or reward that a person may receive in exchange for sex work and to ensure they are not forced or coerced into undertaking such work. Meddick consulted with Scarlett Alliance and Vixen Collective, Victoria’s peer-only sex worker organisation, in drafting the amendments. “Unfortunately the bill does fall short in some areas,” Vixen Collective acting manager Dylan O’Hara said. “It does need strengthening to ensure that all parts of our sex worker community can enjoy the benefits of decriminalisation. We need this to be full, genuine decriminalisation that extends to all sex workers.” Guardian Australia understands the opposition will move several amendments, as will the Justice Party, who want to prohibit certain individuals from owning and operating a brothel. Meddick, Patten, Greens leader Samantha Ratnam, the two Liberal Democratic MPs and Sustainable Australia’s Clifford Hayes are supporting it, providing the government with more than enough votes for it to pass the upper house.",News/Australia news,How will Victoria’s sex work decriminalisation bill work and will it make the industry safer?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/07/how-will-victorias-sex-work-decriminalisation-bill-work-and-will-it-make-the-industry-safer
2/7/2022,"Rapid Covid tests will be made tax deductible for workers and businesses, but the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, says other economic support measures must wind up as the economy returns to normal. In a major economic speech to the Australian Industry Group on Monday, the treasurer will also announce that he has tasked the Productivity Commission with undertaking another five-yearly review into reforms to enhance productivity.  The speech from the treasurer comes ahead of the parliamentary sitting fortnight where the Coalition is expected to come under pressure from Labor over the government’s handling of the pandemic, including on rapid antigen test supplies and the crisis in aged care. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, will also come under fire for divisions within the government after revelations that the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, branded him a “liar and a hypocrite” in a message sent to the former Liberal staffer Brittany Higgins. On Sunday, Morrison said he “could not care less” about the text messages, as Labor’s shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers labelled the government a “smoking ruin of division and disunity”. In an attempt to recast the political narrative to the government’s economic management in the final sitting fortnight before the budget, Frydenberg will talk up the government’s health and economic response as being among the best in the world. “Our track record shows that we have got the big calls right – protecting lives and livelihoods but also ensuring our fiscal position remains strong,” Frydenberg will say, according to draft excerpts of the speech. Pointing to Australia’s falling unemployment rate, Frydenberg will highlight the increased mobility in the labour market, with government payroll data showing workers who had moved jobs “typically experienced pay increases of between 8 and 10%”. “They also move to more productive firms, helping those firms grow,” Frydenberg will say. “When workers are in high demand, businesses are more likely to invest in capital, making workers more productive and businesses more efficient. Frydenberg describes the movement of workers in the tight labour market as a “great reshuffle”, with the government’s jobkeeper payment avoiding the large number of job losses that had been seen in other economies hit by the Covid pandemic. Treasury figures show more than 1 million workers started new jobs in the three months to November 2021, with Australia’s unemployment rate now sitting at a 13-year low of 4.2%. At a speech to the National Press Club last week, Morrison flagged that an unemployment rate below 4% could be achieved in the second half of 2022, revising down expectations outlined in December’s mid year budget update of an unemployment rate of 4.25% by 2022-23. Frydenberg says the government’s decision to end jobkeeper was “not easy”, but the economic rebound following the end of lockdowns showed the move was necessary. He also says maintaining government spending at pandemic levels would end up doing more economic harm than good, and it is now time to “start confidently moving back towards normalised economic settings”. “The reality is the economy simply cannot be conditioned to the level of unprecedented support that has been required over the last two years,” Frydenberg will say. “This level of government intervention must not become entrenched and become a permanent feature of our system.” The treasurer’s speech will also raise the spectre of higher inflation, saying that workforce shortages and supply chain disruptions are exacerbating inflationary pressures in Australia, where inflation is sitting at 3.5% through the year to December. Inflation is rising faster than at any point in the past decade, with the cost of non-discretionary goods rising faster than discretionary goods, but is subdued compared to the US where inflation is now topping 7%. Morrison last week was unable to answer a question about the cost of a loaf of bread, a litre of petrol or a rapid Covid test, but said the government’s focus was on strong economic management that would keep the cost of living down. Frydenberg said that the “pandemic related challenges” of inflation, workforce shortages and supply chain disruptions would remain for most of the year, and would be the government’s focus in the March budget. Under the changes to the tax system to allow for Covid tests to be tax deductible, both PCR and rapid antigen tests will be covered, with the scheme to apply from the 2021-22 financial year. This means that someone on a marginal tax rate of 32.5% will receive a refund at tax time of about $6.50 for every dual pack of RAT bought for $20. A small business would reduce its fringe benefit tax liability by about $20 for every dual pack of RATs bought for $20 and provided to employees. While there are limits to how tests can be claimed under current tax laws, the proposed amendments will clarify that all Covid tests bought for work-related purposes will be tax deductible for income earners, and exempt from FBT for businesses. “COVID-19 tests are an important tool being used by businesses to protect their workforce and to ensure they can keep their doors open and our supply chains running,” Frydenberg said. Chalmers said if Labor won the election the party would manage the budget more responsibly than the Liberals and Nationals. “We’ve put lots of thought into the economic conditions that we would inherit; skyrocketing cost of living, real wages going backwards, a trillion dollars of debt in the budget and not enough to show for it,” Chalmers told Sky News. The Productivity Commission review, which comes five years after the Shifting the Dial report completed in 2017, will examine the factors that have affected Australia’s productivity growth and set out a “roadmap” for future reform. The inquiry will undertake a public inquiry process and report within 12 months.",News/Australia news,Rapid Covid tests to be tax deductible but Frydenberg says pandemic supports must end,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/07/rapid-covid-tests-to-be-tax-deductible-but-frydenberg-says-pandemic-supports-must-end
2/7/2022,"This past week has marked five years since the first AFLW game was played. It is still far too easy to identify cracks in the league, including a lack of representation, a truncated season and an ongoing pursuit of pay parity. Equally, though, looking back also serves as a way of counting blessings. In five years, all AFL clubs now have a women’s side. The AFLW has gone from being a largely symbolic league moulded in the shape of the men’s competition to a very distinct and strategic offering for the AFL. Women and girls have signed up to play football in droves.  The more remarkable story is what AFLW has come to represent. One cannot underestimate the relationship between women’s sport – and the AFLW specifically – and the rise of gender equity in this country. Thinking back to the lock-out crowd at that inaugural game in 2017, the statement being made by the more than 24,500 people who turned up to watch Carlton v Collingwood, was clear. It was time for women to come to the fore in new and exciting ways. If crowd numbers at subsequent games are an indication, many of the people at Ikon Park that night were not necessarily women’s football fans. Regardless, they flocked to the game, the atmosphere of which felt more like a summer ‘sit-in’ than a game of football. Everyone wanted to be there and make visible their support of what to many seemed like the start of a new herstory. In 2017, while America was reckoning with gender equity through the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements spearheaded by Hollywood and celebrity, Australia was grappling with its own feminism through the prism of sport. Like #MeToo, AFLW crashed onto our screens and into our consciousness. In the way in which #MeToo felt jolting to many, so too did the AFLW – despite the years of pioneering women laying the groundwork for both movements. The sight of women playing this brutish, physical game was perhaps one of the purest disruptions in women’s sport this country had seen. That it is hard to think about it in these terms now is itself a sign of the progress we have made. Similarly, it was not that long ago that the image of Tayla Harris kicking a football was sexualised to alarming degree, sparking a debate and subsequent progress around the sexualisation of women’s bodies in sport and online sexism and bullying. Even in AFL circles, the AFLW has brought gender equity conversations to the fore. Industry networks will know it was not long before the AFLW that the annual AFL Women’s Lunch was accompanied by swag bags for every guest with inclusions from sponsors of laundry powder, wine, make-up and lip gloss. These were at the time seen as significantly tone-deaf and symbolic of an AFL that had no understanding of women, womanhood and the desire of women in the industry to be taken seriously. In the same way that, for a long time, men’s sport was the prism through which we understood masculinity, women’s sport has a similar relationship to a distinctly Australian womanhood. Unlike AFLM’s relationship to masculinity (which is in the midst of its own evolution), AFLW has, it seems, have thrown open the doors of what is possible for many Australian women. As AFLW analyst and broadcaster Gemma Bastiani, who was working in the music industry in 2017 says “... I had spent seven years trying to figure out a way to make my passion for footy a career. That game [in 2017], and the AFLW as a whole, made me realise that there is just as much need for women in off-field roles as there is on”. AFLW has meant more women are not only playing but also broadcasting, coaching and leading. While the gains do not yet come close to equity, the AFLW’s existence over five years has pushed the conversation along. The AFLW is multitasking, in that it both symbolises gender equity and actively seeks it, and that is worthy of celebration. But what does ultimate progress look like? Perhaps it will be realised when the league and the women who play it are not asked to shoulder the representation of all women, feminism and gender equity, but are simply footballers. Earlier in the season, Carlton’s Darcy Vescio pointed to well-meaning commentary opining that improved playing standards were adding to the heavy “load” already carried by players. One wonders if the players themselves would prefer to simply ‘be’, and play without a generation’s expectations of progress and excellence on their shoulders? Still, in years to come, when we reflect on a decade’s worth of progress, we will perhaps talk about the AFLW in the same way we might our first female prime minister and that huge MCG crowd at the Women’s Twenty20 World Cup final on International Women’s Day.",Sport/Sport,"Five years after the first, each AFLW game marks march towards progress | Rana Hussain",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/07/five-years-after-the-first-each-aflw-game-marks-march-towards-progress
2/7/2022,"A group of surfers riding the break is a quintessential image of Australian summer. I have wished I could be out there on a board with them for as long as I can remember. As a youngster I learned to ride skateboards, boogie boards and to ski. But learning to surf – especially now, on the wrong side of 50 – seemed out of reach. Still, on a four-week break in a seaside town, I decided to try anyway.  The man at the Golden Breed store in Noosa Heads suggested a board that was long, wide and light enough to carry. I told myself that the shop was some sort of sign, as my first skateboard, circa 1979, had also been from Golden Breed. A month’s rental cost about $350, but buying a board was about $400. So I left the store with a new, 8ft 4in “foamie” named Darkhorse, and a pamphlet on surf etiquette. A quick internet search after my purchase told me Darkhorse featured reinforced polyethylene to give “stiffness and durability”, and was “designed to withstand heavy Hawaiian conditions”. None of which I really needed. Or so I thought. In the first year of Covid I had done a two-hour surfing lesson at Sydney’s Manly beach. The key messages were fairly simple: try to get from lying down to standing up in one go (the “pop-up”); look to where you want to go; lean on your front foot to accelerate and on your back foot to brake. Simple, right? The swell at Noosa Heads can be beautiful, and great for beginners. With my new rashie (make sure it goes to your elbows or you’ll get “foamie board-burn” on your arms), my freshly waxed Darkhorse (choose the right wax for the conditions – cool, warm, tropical etc), and a leg rope (attach it to which ever foot is at the back of the board), I paddled out. Layne Beachley I was not. Many wipeouts and a few milliseconds standing on the board made for a fairly exhausting first encounter. The pop-up was hard. Very hard. Especially when your upper body strength is not what it used to be. “Put your hands close together, under your body, and push up quickly,” a friendly surf instructor advised me as I wiped out through the middle of his private lesson with a 10-year-old. “And never, ever look down”. At night I Googled learn-to-surf videos and practised my pop-up on the carpet. But a few more days in the water got me pretty much nowhere. And then there was the first of three ocean curveballs. Overnight, the beach’s gentle, small waves were replaced with 8ft monsters, courtesy of Cyclone Seth, which had descended down the Queensland coast. I’d ridden a boogie board after a cyclone here in the 80s, but this was much more intense. Local surfers said the three days of big waves were some of the best they’d ever seen after a cyclone. The power was enough to dump a huge tree trunk on Noosa’s Main Beach. I stayed firmly on dry land. On the fourth or fifth day, the swell was all but gone, and I was back in the water, still struggling with my pop-up. And then, on a single wave I’ll never forget, I stood and surfed all the way to the beach. The glide was almost hypnotic. My brain didn’t really know how it happened, but my body somehow did. The end of week two brought a second curve-ball: another cyclone swell, this time from Cyclone Cody, 2,700km away, off Fiji, pulsing powerful waves and a strong tow. I took refuge in the small foam waves in beginners’ corner at the far end of the beach. Another instructor took pity on me, professing his want to “share the love of surfing”. “Be careful not to push on the rails (sides of the board) as it will tip over,” he said. As far as I can tell, there’s not really any timeline when learning to surf. As a longtime surfer friend told me, the only way you learn to do it is to just keep doing it. Over and over and over. The pop-up somehow becomes instinctive. Your strength improves each time. And if you are prepared to be unceremoniously dumped on a regular basis, things progress. The final ocean curveball was the aftermath of the tsunami caused by the eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai undersea volcano off Tonga. Its impact locally was devastating. And from 3,000km away, its distant power could be felt in the waves and rips on Australia’s eastern seaboard. After the worst had passed, beginners’ corner at high tide was again my refuge. In four weeks I went from barely being able to push up to standing on most waves (admittedly not for very long). I still don’t really know how it happened. Somehow I had developed instincts about where and when to push up, and my feet seemed to know where to go. I did however manage to pop a rib out of place on my last day surfing. But it was just by jumping on the board, not wiping out. The local physio (also a surfer) told me to “work on my pop-up strength” before going out again. And that’s really the best advice I can give anyone wanting to learn to surf. Be as strong and as fit as you can when you try it. It exposes all sorts of muscles you either never knew you had, or hadn’t used in ages.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"‘Never, ever look down’: a middle-aged guide to catching waves",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/07/never-ever-look-down-a-middle-aged-guide-to-catching-waves
2/7/2022,"Leigh Jorey was pretty successful in his mid-30s. A panel beater by trade, he’d completed an apprenticeship, owned his own tow truck company, and worked at it hard. His success didn’t stop him becoming homeless. In fact, it may have contributed to the problem. Under pressure, Jorey began to turn to less healthy ways of coping, which led him into a downward spiral.  “Ultimately, that led to me being unable to manage tenancies, manage commitments, manage responsibilities – so it was easier to not have them,” Jorey tells Guardian Australia. “It was easier to live in squalid conditions, factories, people’s lounges, parks. I’d fall asleep at train stations. It was just easier not to have a commitment to anything.” Jorey would remain homeless for nearly 20 years. His story overlaps with thousands of others who have experienced homelessness, and a new report from the Australian Alliance to End Homelessness and the Centre for Social Impact at the University of Western Australia (UWA) has brought them together. Released on Monday, the report, titled Ending Homelessness in Australia: An Evidence and Policy Deep Dive, draws on surveys collected from 20,953 people who have come into contact with homelessness services across Australia over the past 10 years. Prof Paul Flatau, director of the Centre for Social Impact at UWA and lead author of the report, says the dataset is the largest of its kind and the report marks the first time it has been analysed. “We have done lots of studies in the past but it’s usually on a relatively small number of people in the inner cities – a single place for one intervention – or it’s using census data, or data from one organisation,” Flatau says. “This is quite unique because it’s very big – a really large, deep and rich database that we can use to understand the circumstances and journeys of people in very precarious situations.” Of the 20,953 respondents experiencing homelessness, 35% were sleeping rough and 44% were in temporary accommodation or short-term accommodation. The average amount of time they reported experiencing homelessness was 3.8 years. For families, it was 1.9 years. Health was a principal issue, with prevalence rates of asthma, liver disease, dehydration, hepatitis, heart disease and diabetes among people who were homeless all higher than the general population. Almost a third of respondents (31%) said they had been taken to a hospital against their will for mental health reasons. More than a quarter (26%) of people said they had been discriminated against by homelessness or housing services due to their age, race, appearance, disabilities, gender identity or sexual orientation. Named after an international movement that aims to end homelessness, the Advance to Zero database also includes a mechanism to track individuals as they move through the system, which researchers say will deepen our understanding of the circumstances that lead someone into homelessness in the first place. For those familiar with the plight of people experiencing homelessness in Australia, the findings merely reinforce the urgency of the issue. “Being homeless takes away your dignity, firstly, so it puts you in a class of person that’s below the rest of society. To get back out is an absolute struggle,” Jorey says. “Without a home you can’t make appointments, you’ve got no way of structuring your life, you’ve got nothing that’s safe. Without a home, you’ve got no connection to a structured community – you’re living day by day with anyone you run into.” Support services for the newly housed is just as essential as the housing itself, Jorey says, as people coming out of homelessness will often struggle to manage medical appointments, engagements with social services, and otherwise keep their heads above water. The report’s authors, meanwhile, are calling for a new national strategy to end homelessness – something they say has been missing since the Rudd government released a white paper in 2008 called The Road Home. New funding is critical to address the massive shortfall in social and public housing, but actual housing needs to be matched with appropriate support services for those people who do finally end up with a secure roof over their heads. “We’ve seen the states and territories increase investment in public and community housing which is great but they’re still way below the actual targets,” Flateau says. “We need a national strategy with national targets, with good target setting and good monitoring. We need a federal government that takes homelessness seriously again.” “No one’s immune from being homeless,” Jorey says. Now 51, he works in a transitional housing organisation, supporting men who are coming out of prison. “It’s hard and you can’t have a one size fits all approach to it. Everyone has different needs.” Once you have a roof over your head, he says, that’s when you can start to work on other things, like mental and physical health, employment, and the kinds of life administration that often feel beyond your capacity when you’re on the street. “I think the main thing is to have the non-judgmental support from organisations to help you navigate the intricacies of maintaining a tenancy and looking after yourself. To help people feel comfortable and to feel they’re in a place that they do deserve to be, and that they’re worthy people – that they are important.”",News/Society,‘To get out is an absolute struggle’: landmark study sheds light on Australians sleeping rough,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/07/to-get-out-is-an-absolute-struggle-landmark-study-sheds-light-on-australians-sleeping-rough
2/7/2022,"On 12 February 2019 the premier of Western Australia, Mark McGowan, attended a dinner with the board of Woodside – just a few weeks before two highly controversial decisions that would be worth billions for some of the biggest players in the WA gas industry, including Woodside. At the time, WA’s Environmental Protection Agency was finalising an important policy on offsets for the oil and gas industry.  It released the policy on 7 March, declaring that large new projects must offset all their carbon emissions. If emissions were to go to net zero, the logical first step was to stop adding to the problem, the EPA argued. Industry opposition was instant and frenzied, led by Woodside’s then chief executive, Peter Coleman, and Kerry Stokes’s The West Australian. A week later, the EPA, which is set up as independent of the government of the day, withdrew the proposal for “further consultation”. Midway through that consultation, the minister for mining, Bill Johnson, announced a new policy – an “aspiration of net zero by 2050” rather than a target, which allowed proponents of major projects to propose their own targets and timeframes. The Australian Financial Review’s report was headlined: “WA moves to muzzle emissions watchdog”. The second decision related to a series of environmental approvals Woodside needed from the EPA to make its $15bn Scarborough/Burrup hub gas project a reality. The project involves opening up the Scarborough gas field off the west coast of the state, with a new pipeline to bring the gas to the Burrup peninsula, near Karratha. It would extend the life of the Pluto LNG terminal, which has been servicing other gas fields. Environmentalists have warned it would be Australia’s most polluting fossil fuel project and would make it almost impossible for WA to meet its stated aim of becoming a net zero emitter. The Burrup peninsula, which First Nations people refer to as Murujuga, is also home to the most extraordinary gallery of rock art. The petroglyphs carved into the reddish brown rock are thought to be 40,000 years old, but are already showing the effects of acid rain, which is caused by industrial activity at the site, including gas processing. On 1 July 2019, the EPA approved a key part of the project – extensions to the use of the Pluto and Northwest shelf gas terminals. The approvals were made under provisions in the WA Environment Act to deal with minor amendments, and no environmental assessment was required. But the Environmental Defenders Office, which is challenging the decision in the WA supreme court on behalf of the Conservation Council of WA, says the approvals are far from minor and would have the effect of extending the life of the facilities for 50 years. The council’s director, Piers Verstegen, says: “This is the most polluting fossil fuel project ever to be proposed in Australia. “It’s astonishing to think that a project of that level of international significance has been given backdoor approvals by the state government without any consideration or assessment or consultation with stakeholders,” he says. “It’s really alarming.” The case was heard over three days just before Christmas, with a decision to come within weeks. But in November McGowan said he would not let the ruling affect industries if the environment approval was found to be invalid. “We can’t have scores of industries close down because of a court ruling, so the state government will do what it has to do to make sure industries stay open,” the premier said. Asked whether McGowan would be prepared to change the environmental laws or pass special retrospective legislation for Woodside should the environmental groups win the case, a spokesperson for the premier said: “The matter will be handled by the state solicitor. As the matter is before the courts we are unable to comment. “The Environmental Protection Authority is independent, it is not subject to direction by the minister, and its advice to government is public. EPA members are not public servants.” McGowan has declined to comment on his attendance at the Woodside board dinner. “The McGowan government is committed to reaching net zero emissions by 2050 and is developing a credible pathway to get there. Should we be surprised that the premier of WA was invited to dinner with the Woodside board? Isn’t rubbing shoulders with the state’s biggest employers and wealth creators what premiers do? That perhaps depends on one’s perspective on the role of our elected representatives. When it comes to projects with enormous economic, environmental and social impacts, perceptions of independence and the maintenance of public confidence in government impartiality are critical. In WA, the close relationship between elected representatives and businesses that form the economic engine of the state is so familiar it almost goes without comment. But the chumminess has not always been healthy. Under Labor’s Brian Burke, the WA government in the 1980s became enmeshed with a cohort of businessmen, including Alan Bond, Laurie Connell and John Roberts, who had become major donors to the ALP. The resulting scandal, known as WA Inc, led to a royal commission, which found some practices “were such as to place our governmental system at risk”. “Unfortunately, some of that conduct and some of those practices were peculiar to Western Australia; but there is no reason to believe that many of the fundamental questions raised by our inquiry were unique to this period or to this State,” the commission found. The McGowan government’s interactions do not involve investment of taxpayers’ money in ventures, as Burke’s did, nor is there any suggestion of improper conduct. But the deep connections between the fossil fuel industry and government raise legitimate questions about how relationships with business are managed. Four of the past five WA premiers have had staff who worked for the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (Appea) before or after their positions as advisers to the premier. One of McGowan’s key political advisers, Kieran Murphy, spent nine years at Appea. McGowan’s former chief of staff of nine years, Guy Houston, departed in June 2021 for a job with WA’s dominant media owner, Kerry Stokes. Before working for McGowan, he was corporate communications and media adviser to the US energy company Chevron – a key player in the WA gas industry. At the March 2021 election the state’s treasurer and Aboriginal affairs minister, Ben Wyatt, an ally of McGowan, left politics and joined the boards of Woodside in June 2021 and Rio Tinto in September 2021. Wyatt’s appointments came as the state government prepared to introduce the revised Aboriginal Heritage Act – which Wyatt helped draft as the responsible minister – and ahead of a final decision by the environment minister on the Scarborough LNG project. There is no suggestion that Houston, Murphy or Wyatt have done anything wrong by making such career moves. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning From the companies’ point of view, Wyatt joining their boards was a coup. Rio was under pressure over its destruction of the Juukan Gorge heritage site; Woodside was on the brink of receiving an approval for Scarborough. Wyatt told the ABC at the time his work with Rio Tinto was not likely to cover mining operations, but instead focus on building relationships and making sure the organisation met community expectations. Wyatt acknowledged that the entire board was responsible for decision-making, but said “good governance practices allow directors to declare conflicts of interest and excuse themselves from deliberations on particular matters”. He said he did not make representations to former government colleagues and senior public servants on behalf of the companies, as both employed senior people to undertake government relations. “I decided to become a director of five organisations, all of which have very close and enduring relationships with Aboriginal people in the arts, health, sport and resources sectors. Prior to the tragedy of Juukan Gorge, Rio Tinto had a strong reputation for Indigenous affairs. I am determined that Rio restore their role as industry leaders in respect of relationships with traditional owners of the country on which the company operates.” But both appointments raised questions about whether a minister – or a senior staff member – should be permitted to move into jobs that potentially overlapped with immediate past portfolio responsibilities. The risks around confidential information and managing the relationship with former colleagues in such circumstances are obvious. WA, like NSW and the commonwealth, has restrictions on staff and ministers becoming registered lobbyists, but not on going to work for companies themselves. The 2021 WA ministerial code says only that ministers leaving government “should exercise care in taking up employment or business activities in the period immediately after leaving government”. It warns of accepting employment with companies with “which the departments or branches of government are, as a matter of course, in a special relationship”. It also warns about using confidential information gained during office and taking care to ensure that preferential treatment for the new employer or the business is not obtained by the use of contacts and personal influence by the former minister. A spokesperson for McGowan said: “All state government employees, including ministers, are expected to follow the guidelines and code of conduct provided by the department of premier and cabinet. “This code of conduct requires employees to act with integrity in the performance of official duties and declare any perceived or potential conflict of interests so that it can be managed accordingly.” Wyatt said: “I exercised due caution before I took on all five board roles that I hold. It is important to note that these are not executive roles. As governance roles they do not involve regular interactions with government.” Resources companies are regular donors to both main parties in the west, as elsewhere in Australia. The most recent data, for 2020-21, shows that Woodside gave the Liberals $82,000, the Nationals $42,000 and Labor $108,350. The donations, totalling more than $232,000, were spread between the federal and WA branches of the parties. Appea was also a major donor to both sides, contributing $107,00, while Chevron donated $74,650, also spread across the political spectrum. In previous years, the gas industy’s support for the WA ALP has been less direct, with donations going to the Perth Trades Hall Council, which then supported the WA ALP, and to the federal branch of the ALP. The federal ALP then rebated money to the WA branch. Data on the last six months, when several important decisions in relation to Woodside and the gas industry were taken by the McGowan government, won’t become public for another 12 months. A spokesperson for McGowan said: “Political donations are managed separately by the party.” In WA few people hold as much sway as Kerry Stokes. As the owner of the only daily newspaper and the highest rating television network, the website Perth Now and a stable of regional and community newspapers, Stokes has an outsized voice in WA politics. He also has substantial business interests beyond media. Seven Group Holdings owns the Australian Caterpillar franchise and Stokes has interests in oil and gas, through Beach Energy, which is developing the Waitsia onshore gas project with Japan’s Mitsui. In 2020 the McGowan government, fearing a shortage of domestic gas and rising prices, moved to tighten its domestic gas reservation policy. It required onshore gas to be sold in the domestic market, but made an exception for the Waitsia stage two project in the state’s midwest. It was permitted to sell some of its gas to the more lucrative LNG export market for a short period. McGowan abruptly ended a press conference in August 2020 when asked if he had discussed the Waitsia exemption with Kerry Stokes or his son, Ryan. Chief executive of Seven Group Holdings, Ryan Stokes, defended the Waitsia exemption as “absolutely” good for WA and employment, and put it down largely to a long-running engagement between Mitsui and the state government. McGowan also defended the exemption. “The Waitsia Gas Project Stage 2 in the midwest provided urgently needed jobs, royalties and economic stimulus for the region and the state, a spokesperson said in a statement to Guardian Australia. “The domestic gas arrangement enabled the project to get off the ground and in the long term deliver large volumes of domestic gas to support the state’s economy, assisting with the Covid-19 economic recovery. “From 2029, all remaining Waitsia reserves will be made available to the domestic market. But it is the Scarborough/Burrup LNG project that threatens to become the biggest focus for opponents of McGowan’s gas plans. The Conservation Council WA was once almost the lone voice of opposition, but since BHP and Woodside formally gave the green light for the massive investment in November, environmental groups around the country have begun mobilising against it. They say it will be Australia’s largest fossil fuel project and more polluting than Adani’s Carmichael coalmine. If CCWA wins its case before the WA supreme court, Woodside would probably be required to resubmit the environmental approvals for the gas terminals via a more comprehensive process involving detailed environmental assessments and public consultation. That could delay the project for a year or more, assuming Woodside gets its approval. That’s why McGowan is hinting at overriding an adverse finding for Woodside with legislation. Because of the project’s size, scale and forecast lifespan it means Australia’s progress toward net zero emissions by 2050 could be undone in a stroke of a pen. For now, McGowan enjoys wildly high support in his home state, thanks to his Covid strategy and a booming economy. But such a move could turn Scarborough into the next Adani, attracting national and international attention.",News/Australia news,WA holds the key to Australia’s emissions goals.

2/7/2022,"Economics in Australia is frequently reduced to debates around government debt. Claims and counterclaims about profligacy and borrowings overlook several issues. First, the current scale of the debt is unprecedented outside of wars. At the end of 2021, global debt was US$295tn – 350% of everything the world produces in a year, compared with 282% in 2008. The major increase is in government debt, which has reached a record 99% of global output. US, eurozone and Japanese government debt is now at 103%, 98% and 257% of output respectively.  Australia’s federal debt is forecast to peak at less than 40% of output by 2025, well below the average for advanced countries. But the number is deceptive. It excludes borrowings by state and local governments, which over the same period will rise to around 20% of output, but could be greater depending on state infrastructure spending. It disregards contingent liabilities, such as New South Wales’ controversial Transport Asset Holding Entity, which holds public transport assets helping improve the state’s finances. It ignores exposure to private-public partnerships used to finance infrastructure, which governments may have to support to ensure essential services. It overlooks implicit government guarantees for Australia’s “too big to fail” banking system, which is heavily exposed to households carrying debt of around 130% of output, among the world’s highest. Australia’s debt levels are also high considering a narrowly based economy, a limited tax base and overreliance on one trading partner – China. Second, rather than financing investments which would generate future income, much of Australia’s government debt has been used to finance recurrent expenditure, transfers and tax cuts – and, during Covid-19 lockdowns, to replace lost earnings. Third, excessive government borrowing limits economic flexibility. Higher rates would raise the commonwealth and state’s interest payments (already forecast to reach 1.4% of output over the next three years), reducing funds for other outlays. Rising debt levels reduce the capacity to deal with crises such as the pandemic and natural disasters. Fourth, individuals and businesses must satisfy lenders as to their income and repayment ability. In contrast, governments increasingly rely on central bank money creation to meet obligations. The Reserve Bank currently holds around a third of all government debt (over $300bn), mostly purchased since 2020. But fiscal deterioration and currency debasement risk loss of confidence among foreign investors who hold roughly two-thirds of federal government bonds, constraining access to overseas capital. Fifth, the options for managing the run-up in debt are limited. “Budget repair” (raising taxes or cutting expenditure) risks weakening already diminishing growth prospects. With economic activity requiring ever higher amounts of new debt, reining in borrowings could setting off a negative spiral damaging activity and government budgets. Other alternatives are equally unappealing. Inflation, effectively covert taxation, can help deleverage by boosting revenues and reducing purchasing power, but would hurt low income groups, exacerbate inequality and raise social tensions. Devaluations reduce the value of Australian government debt held by foreigners but would affect the cost of imports or the ability to borrow overseas. Default or debt restructuring, effectively national bankruptcy or former prime minister Paul Keating’s “banana republic”, is unthinkable. The historical experience of managing excessive debt is not encouraging. Between 1914 and 1939, the first world war and the Great Depression damaged public finances. Countries making up nearly half of global output defaulted or were forced to enter arrangements with creditors resulting in severe social and economic costs. After the second world war, some countries defaulted or experienced hyperinflation. Others resorted to capital controls, loan rationing and mandatory investment in government debt at below inflation rates. Strong growth driven by pent-up demand and post-war reconstruction, conditions not applicable today, helped control borrowing levels. While the now abandoned gold standard restricted policy choices then, substantial debt reduction still remains difficult. The problem is fundamentally behavioural. Voters love the lower taxes and state-provided goods and services funded by government borrowing rather than taxes. Over time, more and more borrowing with diminishing returns must be incurred just to maintain the status quo. Unfortunately, true prosperity cannot be built on excessive cheap credit. Since the 2008 global financial crisis, the world has perversely tried to solve the problems of debt with more borrowing. As philosopher Denis Diderot observed: “we swallow greedily any lie that flatters us, but we sip only little by little at a truth we find bitter.” Australian government debt has increased the most of any major economy this century, more than doubling over two decades. The nation faces perhaps another 10 years of budget deficits. While government borrowing is not yet unsustainable or irretrievable, an informed and considered discussion about the trajectory would not be amiss, preferably before that point is reached.

2/7/2022,"Turns of phrase like “the role they were born to play” or “no actor could do it better” invariably sound a little twee, but by god they apply to Jack Black’s breathtakingly good performance in Bernie. Playing a Texan mortician in Richard Linklater’s 2011 film seems like the role Black’s entire career had been building towards, offering the actor, singer and comedian a semi-musical acting part that’s both boisterously loud and irresistibly sweet. Bernie, which I haven’t stopped thinking about or periodically rewatching since it arrived more than decade ago, is a true crime comedy– an uncommon combination, given that true crime hardly screams “hilarity”. But there’s a strange brilliance in this shrewd and emotionally affecting production, for my money among the finest comedy films of the 21st century to date. At its core is an idea that seems rather perverse when distilled into a few words: what if a convicted killer, who really did do it, is actually a swell, big-hearted bloke?  The film begins with Black’s real-life character, Bernie Tiede, totally in his element: lovingly preparing corpses while addressing a class of mortuary students. He removes nasal, ear and facial hair, then conceals the dead man’s teeth, explaining that visible chompers can create unintentional humour – and “you cannot have grief tragically become a comedy.” What are we to make of the film itself in those terms: the relationship between tragedy, grief and humour? It’s complicated. Tiede is a real man who committed a crime– as this is both a historical fact and tied to the film’s premise, it is hard to avoid spoilers. But knowing what happened going in – as I did – only heightens the satire of Linklater and Black’s portrayal of a fabulously nice and kind murderer. In 1996, Tiede shot dead 81-year-old widow Marjorie Nugent and stuffed her body into a freezer, where it was found nine months later. He then spent large amounts of her money, mostly on charities and civic activities. Nugent is brilliantly portrayed in the film by Shirley MacLaine as a crusty old bag who makes Ebenezer Scrooge seem magnanimous: a performance so good, so bitterly unlikeable, I imagine the great actor sucking the juice out of a lemon before the cameras rolled. The pair’s oddest-of-odd-couple friendship has a “sugar mumma” vibe about it, Bernie befriending the wealthy and widely loathed Nugent, becoming the heir to her estate, and traveling the world with her in the lap of luxury. Linklater frames the film as a campfire conversation about their relationship, regularly cutting to the townspeople of Carthage – mostly actors, but some playing themselves – who narrativise the couple’s lives, arranging the story to suit their biases, preconceptions and unashamedly pro-Bernie stance. The consensus is that a sweet, decent, giving man one day lost control, regretfully – but not unforgivably – shooting dead a crotchety miser who lived a life of meanness. Out to nab Bernie, and sickened by the community’s support of him, is a yee-haw district attorney, Danny Buck Davidson played by Matthew McConaughey, in another of the film’s pitch-perfect performances. Davidson successfully moved the trial to a different county, telling a journalist, “I’m not sure I can find 12 citizens in Panola County willing to convict Tiede.” In the film, he propels a counter message: Bernie is a killer, pure and simple, and murder can never be excused. To convince the jurors, Davidson amplifies his negative character assessment, and we have two extremes: the conservative townspeople standing by Bernie no matter what (despite him being “a little light in the loafers”, according to one local), and the DA screaming blue murder. The truth, like in most things, is probably somewhere in the middle. And while it’s no secret which side Linklater is on (Tiede even lived in the director’s garage when he was temporarily freed, before being resentenced to life in prison), the extent to which justice should be determined by the community or by the law is ultimately a matter for viewers to decide – if they can ever reach a conclusion, or want to stop rewatching an amazing film.
