2/7/2022,"In the crown of the tall beech tree at the corner of the lane, two pairs of rooks are perching close together. While not adding much warmth, the last of the afternoon sun, as it creeps beneath the western bank of cloud, at least brings some colour to their plumage and the bare branches around them. The main rookery is just over a mile away – a noisy, crowded roost in a collection of pines – and in recent years I have noticed a number of rooks apparently scouting for other accommodation.  From an adjacent tree, a much smaller jackdaw sits above last year’s nest, regarding the newcomers without recognisable enthusiasm. The hollow way through which the lane rises across the hillside is dank and edged with the gurgling of field drains emptying slowly into the stream. The colours here are muted, bare soil and wet leaf litter dominate the palette, while a few bright ivy leaves stand out where they rise against lichen-covered trunks. Another tree has fallen in the high winds since the new year – folding across the path and leaving a gap in the field boundary like a broken tooth. In the top corner of the field by the old quarry, chains of fresh molehills swirl across the pasture – made during the creation of the shallow burrows into which their earthworm prey will fall. Worm activity is temperature dependent, so perhaps the moles are getting a good harvest in this warm winter. No signs of early spring have appeared yet in the quarry, even where the trees are partly sheltered from the prevailing westerly wind by the steep back wall. Both oak and ash stand skeletal against a sky softened by cloud and encroaching mist. As quickly as it had emerged, the sun slides behind another bank of cloud and the temperature drops markedly. As the light fades, the sky turns the same colour as the hammered lead cap of the gatepost by the stile. I clamber over the cold, wet wood with exaggerated caution, and blackbirds begin their evening calls as I regain the lane.

2/7/2022,"The Nine Network’s multi-million dollar deal to secure an exclusive interview with the family of Cleo Smith failed to put the program in the top ratings spot on Sunday night, although the 60 Minutes episode did win its timeslot. The network spent weeks teasing the 60 Minutes exclusive with Cleo’s mother Ellie Smith and her stepfather Jake Gliddon, which cost it $2m.  The program took out the top spot for its 8.40pm slot, with 750,000 viewers, but lost out overall to Seven News (1.095 million viewers), Nine News (827,000) and Married At First Sight (825,000). Nine defended the program’s ratings, saying it was the most-watched 60 Minutes episode this year. “We are very pleased with the result and the content of the 60 Minutes interview which was compelling as Tara Brown spoke to the parents of Cleo Smith for the first time,” a Nine spokesperson said. “The show won its timeslot and performed in the key demographics and on 9Now – a record streaming audience for the program meaning last night’s episode as a total number was an increase on the equivalent episode last year, and this is what we look to, we are all extremely pleased.” The ratings from OzTam showed that within the Smith family’s home state of Western Australia just 67,000 viewers tuned in, the same number to watch ABC’s Vera in the state that evening. 60 Minutes has a long history of paying for interviews, with disgraced wellness blogger Belle Gibson paid $75,000 for appearing on the show in 2015, according to court documents. That episode pulled 1.073 million metro viewers. Sunday night’s “world exclusive” was led by reporter Tara Brown, who was unable to fly to WA to conduct the interview. Terence Darrell Kelly, 36, has pleaded guilty to taking four-year-old Cleo from the Blowholes campground in Point Quobba where her family were camping. Cleo’s disappearance sparked a major police investigation that led detectives to a property in Carnarvon, minutes from Cleo’s family home. “She was sitting on the bed and we ran up to her and she was like ‘hi mum’, like nothing had happened,” Smith told 60 Minutes. The reuniting scene at Carnarvon, about 900km north of Perth, was one of joy. “I still don’t think she really understood what happened in general, you know, being so young.” Since getting home Cleo doesn’t like closed doors and sleeps with the lights on, and has woken up screaming with “nightmare after nightmare”, her mother said. “Still to this day we don’t know the full story,” she said in her first media interview. “She has blocked out a lot as to what’s happened. She went into survivor mode and pushed it very far away.” Officers broke in and found Cleo alone in a room, physically unharmed and playing with toys. “We’ve got a long way to go and so does she,” Smith said of the family’s recovery. “She (Cleo) is probably going to be dealing with this for the rest of her life.” Kelly is yet to answer other charges and more details of the kidnapping are expected to be outlined when he faces Perth district court on 25 March.

2/7/2022,"The contrived nonchalance with which federal ministers are attempting to ignore or belittle the ruckus caused by an outbreak of text message frankness is an indicator of how seriously the matter is being taken. And so it should be.  Senior people within the embrace of the Liberal and Nationals parties have said nasty things about Scott Morrison, then someone within that same embrace has made the insults public. The texts used the type of language you might expect around the front bar at closing time. Calling the prime minister a “psycho”, “horrible, horrible” and a “hypocrite” is not what US Republicans in another context would classify as civil discourse. There is a brutality within the messages and their paths to public awareness which cannot be ignored or belittled. Deputy Nationals leader David Littleproud Monday on ABC radio acknowledged party MPs would have a “candid conversation” about leader Barnaby Joyce’s role in the text tumult but then argued only press gallery journalists were “excited” by the issue. And it is instructive to note what the prime minister’s office has done, as opposed to what ministers may be saying. When the Sydney Morning Herald last Friday afternoon revealed it had the contents of the Barnaby Joyce text, the prime minister’s office moved swiftly into a damage minimisation strategy. It marshalled a cringing apology from Joyce and a statement of saintly forgiveness from Morrison, and arranged an early Saturday morning Joyce press conference to get his contrition on TV and radio news services. Much out of character – and not just for apologising – Joyce readily accepted being told what to do, because he knew he and the government were in trouble. That Friday evening, the PMO gave the updated package of statements to the Australian – not the SMH – possibly in the belief the package would receive a treatment more comforting for the government. This was not the reaction of a government which would like you to think the two sets of texts are a bit of a yawn – of interest only to reporters thriving on the sweepings of politics, not the issues of substance. It’s important to put the incendiary texts into perspective. The messages and their unflattering assessments of Scott Morrison by colleagues are a variation of the old practice of passing notes in school. Instead of the class show-off getting a pasting with sniggering and insults, it is the prime minister, but the similarities are rife. The contents of the messages were from the heart and probably at least marginally accurate, and were a form of reprisal or revenge within a restricted circuit of consensus. It was never intended for the subject of the terse evaluations to know about them. And it’s that point which highlights the importance of revelation of the two sets of text messages – one allegedly between former NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian and an unidentified senior Liberal, the other from deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce and intended to be passed on to former Liberal staffer Brittany Higgins, and leaked by a third party not yet named. Like those scribbled classroom notes and associated sniggers they were not meant to be shared with the subject of the comments. Other prime ministers have suffered from unwanted assessments. Paul Keating didn’t go to much trouble hiding his nickname for Bob Hawke of “Old Jelly Back”, which spread without the need for SMS technology. Former Liberal treasurer Peter Costello occasionally had descriptions of John Howard the former Liberal prime minister might have considered unkind. The difference here is that there already is a substantial queue of people who have looked at Morrison’s character and come to the opinion there are large shortcomings. They are indictments the ALP is collecting in its bid to make character a significant election issue. It’s one thing for the French president to call Morrison a liar, and Labor’s Anthony Albanese can say what he likes with barely a nod from the electorate. However, when two senior figures who have worked with Morrison for years quite separately conclude “he can never be trusted”, as Joyce put it, the character analysis is given weight. It becomes the prism through which Morrison’s election promises are viewed and has the capacity to distort them. Distrust spreads quicker than Covid. The fleeting notion that this scandal could see Scott Morrison toppled should be dismissed. The government is in enough trouble from the uncertainty roused by the pandemic to add to disruption with an abrupt leadership change just months from an election. One thing Scott Morrison can be trusted to do: he will continue to keep Peter Dutton out of the prime minister’s office.

2/7/2022,"Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai has given her first interview to an independent media organisation since she alleged on Weibo that a senior Chinese official had coerced her into sex, saying it was an “enormous misunderstanding”. The interview with French sports daily L’Équipe came as the International Olympic Committee said it wasn’t up to them or anyone else “to judge, in one way or another, her position”.  Peng disappeared from public life after the Weibo post in November, sparking a major international campaign calling for confirmation from the Chinese authorities that she was safe and well. Speaking to L’Équipe in Beijing, Peng said her original statement had been misunderstood. She said she had never accused former vice premier Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault and denied she had disappeared from public view afterwards. The tennis star was accompanied to the interview by the Chinese Olympic Committee’s chief of staff who also acted as translator, the report said. L’Équipe was also required to submit questions in advance and publish her comments verbatim in question-and-answer form, as preconditions for the interview. Peng thanked everyone for caring about her wellbeing, but also questioned why it had been “exaggerated”. “I didn’t think there would be such concern and I would like to know: why such concern?” she said. Peng said there had been a “enormous misunderstanding” over her post, which she confirmed she deleted herself a little under 30 minutes after publishing it because she “wanted to”. She did not give further details. In early November Peng posted an essay to Weibo, describing an on-again-off-again consensual affair with the then 75-year-old, and an incident in which he allegedly pressured her into having sex after inviting her to his house to play tennis with him and his wife. Amid what she described as “complicated feelings”, they allegedly rekindled the affair, until an argument and his failure to meet her shortly before the post. In the L’Équipe interview, Peng reiterated comments she gave to a Singaporean state-controlled outlet in December, saying she never accused Zhang or anyone else of sexually assaulting her. “I hope that we no longer distort the meaning of this post. And I also hope that we don’t add more hype on this,” she said. “I never said anyone sexually assaulted me.” In her post Peng had described Zhang pressing her into having sex and her not agreeing, before relenting. “After dinner I still did not want to, and you said you hated me! You also said that in these seven years, you never forgot me and that you would be good for me etc etc,” she wrote according to a translation by What’s On Weibo. “I was afraid and panicked and carrying the emotions of seven year ago, I agreed … yes, we had sex.” The post went viral despite its quick removal from Weibo. With efforts to contact Peng proving fruitless, and the topic completely censored inside China, the head of the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) Steve Simon went public with his concern for her welfare, and global tennis stars began advocating under the hashtag #WhereIsPengShuai. The saga remained off limits to people inside China, with blanket censorship banning even social media posts about “tennis”. Almost three weeks later China’s external English-language state media began disputing the global concerns, publishing a translation of an email said to be from Peng to Simon – and which Peng later said she did write – and videos of several apparently choreographed public appearances. In the interview with L’Équipe, Peng also said she “never disappeared” and she didn’t know why such concern spread. “It’s just that a lot of people, like my friends, including from the IOC, messaged me, and it was quite impossible to reply to so many messages,” she said, adding that she had responded to emails from friends and the WTA but she had difficulty accessing the organisation’s online communications system. Also on Monday the International Olympic Committee announced its president, Thomas Bach, had met with Peng face to face on Saturday, alongside former chair of the Athletes’ Commission and IOC member Kirsty Coventry. “During the dinner, the three spoke about their common experience as athletes at the Olympic Games, and Peng Shuai spoke of her disappointment at not being able to qualify for the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020,” a statement said. It added that Peng had accepted an invitation to meet again in Europe and to stay in contact with Coventry. The statement did not mention the allegations or Bach’s recent comments that he would support her if she wanted an investigation into Zhang. At a press conference on Monday, spokesperson Mark Adams said the IOC as a sports organisation was doing “everything we can to ensure she is happy”. “I don’t think it’s up to us to be able to judge in one way, just as it’s not for you to judge, in one way or another, her position,” he said. Despite multiple attempts by the WTA, only the IOC has been able to meet with Peng. Questions have previously been raised about the IOC’s handling of the matter, with the organisation accused of too readily accepting Chinese government assurances as to Peng’s welfare ahead of the Winter Olympics. In her interview Peng urged against combining sport and politics, a key message of Beijing during the Olympics as it faces widespread scrutiny and criticism over its human rights records, with diplomatic boycotts and social media campaigns for commercial or viewing boycotts. “My sentimental problems, my private life, should not be involved in sports and politics,” she said. “Sport must not be politicised because when it is, most of the time that amounts to turning one’s back on the Olympic spirit, and it goes against the will of the world of sport and of the athletes.”",Sport/Sport,Peng Shuai says Weibo post sparked ‘enormous misunderstanding’,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/07/peng-shuai-says-weibo-post-sparked-enormous-misunderstanding
2/7/2022,"Dog faeces and urine are being deposited in nature reserves in such quantities that it is likely to be damaging wildlife, according to a new study. The analysis found that the resulting overfertilisation of the ground with nitrogen and phosphorus by footpaths could reach levels that would be illegal on farmland.  The scientists reached their conclusions by counting dog numbers over 18 months in four nature reserves on the outskirts of Ghent in Belgium. They said the situation would be similar across Europe, which is home to about 87 million dogs. Dogs are fed at home and then excrete nutrients while on walks, leaving an annual average of 11kg of nitrogen a hectare and 5kg of phosphorus, the research estimated. That is a similar level of pollution known to be transported through the air from farming, industry and traffic fumes, which ranges from 5kg to 25kg of nitrogen, meaning the impact of dog faeces and urine is significant. Many dog walkers think that leaving their pet’s excretions in nature will not do any harm. But most ecosystems are naturally low nutrient environments and overfertilisation reduces biodiversity by allowing a few thriving plants, such as nettles and hogweed, to drive out others and the wildlife that depends on them. “We were surprised by how high the nutrient inputs from dogs could be,” said Prof Pieter De Frenne of Ghent University, who led the research. “Atmospheric nitrogen inputs from agriculture, industry and traffic rightfully receive a lot of policy attention, but dogs are entirely neglected in this respect.” The researchers estimated the illegal levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in situations where dogs must be kept on leads and can only stray 2 metres either side of a path. “Those levels are quite staggering, as our study concerned nature reserves,” he said. “Of course, there are a lot of beneficial effects [to walks in nature], both physically and psychologically, for owners and their dogs but the drawback is bringing in significant amounts of nutrients.” De Frenne said the level of dog ownership is very similar in many countries in western Europe, so he saw no reason why the situation would be different elsewhere to that in Ghent. British charity Plantlife has warned that nitrogen pollution is “one of the greatest threats to our wild plants, lichens and fungi, yet little is being done to tackle it”. The research, published in the journal Ecological Solutions and Evidence, counted more than 1,600 dogs during 500 nature reserve visits, at all times of day and all days of the week. They combined this data with the known levels of nitrogen and phosphorus excreted by dogs to estimate the total nutrients deposited. The scientists had recorded whether the dogs were on leads or not and when this was taken into account, 126kg/ha/year of nitrogen was deposited by paths and 4kg/ha/year over the rest of the nature reserves. If the dogs were all kept on leads, the amount jumped to 175kg/ha/year by paths, with a similar rise in phosphorus. Picking up and taking away all the dog faeces removed almost all the phosphorus, but only half the nitrogen, because dog urine contains significant nitrogen but little phosphorus. “Urine is, of course, difficult to take away,” said De Frenne. Previous research found that high nutrient levels can persist even three years after dogs are banned. “An important first step is making dog owners aware of this fertilisation effect,” De Frenne said. “I think many people will just pick up the faeces.” But the urine would remain and he said managers of nature reserves with sensitive ecosystems could consider banning dogs, which already happens in some places to protect birds and other wildlife. Rob Stoneman, director of landscape recovery at The Wildlife Trusts, UK, said: “Nature reserves are special places for nature conservation, where wildlife and fragile habitats are protected. Obviously poo is a part of nature, but dog poo contains nutrients which can damage the ecology of vulnerable habitats. Wherever you walk your dog, it is important to pick up, bag and bin poo, to ensure the continued protection of these wild areas for us all to enjoy.” De Frenne said the next steps for the research could involve soil analysis to check the estimates made in the current study and extending the analysis to pet cats.",News/Environment,"Deluge of dog pee and poo harming nature reserves, study suggests",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/07/dog-pee-and-poo-harming-nature-reserves-study
2/7/2022,"In a nation of great thinkers who preferred the clean air of ivory towers over the hubbub of the streets, Theodor Lessing stood out for digging his knuckles into the dust. The great brawler of early 20th-century German philosophy picked fights with those he dismissed as “self-hating” fellow Jewish intellectuals, challenged the towering man-of-letters Thomas Mann to a duel, and skewered the holy cows of the Nazis, who brutally murdered him shortly after seizing power in 1933.  After falling into obscurity for almost a century, a newly published annotated edition of his early writings introduces a new generation to Lessing’s witty and often waspish mind, including the target of his most obsessive gripe: urban din. As founder of Germany’s first anti-noise society, the Jewish-German philosopher and avowed socialist campaigned against organ grinders, coachmen cracking their whips and housewives beating their carpets, expounding his pet hate in a monthly pamphlet called “Der Anti-Rüpel” (“The Anti-Lout”). The noise of the city, Lessing wrote with characteristic acidity, was “the revenge of those working with their hands on those head-workers who laid down their laws”: a kind of aural narcotic that dulled the mind like alcohol or drugs and prevented urban dwellers from sharp enlightened thinking. Published on the eve of Lessing’s 150th birthday on Tuesday , with an afterword by editor Rainer Marwedel, the two-volume, 1,920-page anthology Culture and Nerves also reminds readers that the Hanover-born malcontent was not just the “noise philosopher” his critics liked to mock, but a sharp mind who managed to see through the fog of history with a clarity few of his contemporaries could match. “Lessing wrote philosophically about a wide range of issues,” said Marwedel, who has spent the last 40 years of his life researching Lessing’s biography and annotated edition of his work. “He’d write an essay about Kantian ethics one day, a column about the psychology of stage kisses the next: he was quite French in that way, and not your typical German ivory-tower philosopher”. Two threads run through Lessing’s diverse reflections: a deep philosophical pessimism inherited from his idol Arthur Schopenhauer, and a satirical style reminiscent of Heinrich Heine, in keeping with a Jewish-German literary tradition radically curtailed by the second world war. “For Lessing, insight was attained through suffering, and knowledge was pain”, Marwedel told the Guardian. Such a combative outlook on life could make him a prickly intellectual sparring partner: his book on the “Jewish self-hatred” of his contemporaries allowed that term to gain widespread currency. In 1910, he wrote a satirical screed that mocked the Jewish literary critic Samuel Lublinski using common antisemitic tropes, which in turn led novelist Thomas Mann to denounce Lessing as an “impertinent midget” in an essay of his own. Lessing responded with a telegram in which he asked, perhaps more in jest than in earnest, whether Mann would follow up his words with an armed duel, but the author of Buddenbrooks and The Magic Mountain declined the offer. Lessing’s prickliness could also make him immune to the delusions about German cultural superiority expounded by other thinkers of his age, however. “I have grown sceptical of the beauty and greatness of the German mind,” Lessing says in an essay on English drama, written at a time of growing resentment between the two nations, and reprinted in Culture and Nerves. “In England it is different. The average person there is more eccentric and unique than we are.” Europe’s supposedly enlightened cultural tradition, he would go on to write, had done little to protect the continent’s biodiversity: like a “cruel, merciless machine”, it had driven bears, wolves, moose and other species to extinction. In another essay, also written in 1930, the trained medic warned of the consequences of rainforest destruction and climate change: “Something is changing on our globe,” Lessing wrote. “There will be a change in the climate that will change many people’s ways of living, their professions and their work.” In the ultimate tour de force of his mocking eloquence and piercing foresight, Lessing portrayed the German president Paul von Hindenburg as a puppet of the ascendant National Socialist movement. Hindenburg, he wrote in an article for German-language Prager Abendblatt newspaper in 1925, was “a representative symbol, a question mark, a zero. You could say: better a zero than a Nero. Unfortunately history shows that behind a zero there will always be hiding a future Nero.” The article was as prophetic as it was scandalous: “For German anti-democrats, Hindenburg was effectively a placeholder for the kaiser, so to poke even gentle fun at him amounted to lèse-majesté,” said Marwedel. The scandal led to boycotts of Lessing’s lectures, his dismissal from teaching at Hanover’s Technical University, and eventually his death in exile: on 30 August 1933, a team of three Nazi-supporting assassins from the Sudetenland shot the philosopher through the window of his study in Marienburg, making him the first known victim of the Nazi regime in the Czech Republic. “If anything could be more shocking than the murder of Prof Lessing at Marienbad, it is the indecent joy with which the German press receives the news,” the Manchester Guardian commented on Lessing’s death at the time. “The misguided roughs who shot him were the tools of something bigger than themselves – the Nazi creed which glorifies the murder of political opponents.” Lessing’s spikes and bristles mean Germany’s visionary grumbler has been largely neglected by academia since his death. An open letter published shortly after the assassination, calling for donations to set up an institute in Lessing’s name and produce a complete edition of his writings, was signed by luminaries including Albert Einstein and Bertrand Russell but failed to collect sufficient funds. Marwedel said he had funded the research for the latest volumes largely out of his own pocket. He is currently seeking funding to complete an edition of Lessing’s entire works, amounting to at least nine volumes and 3,600 pages.",News/World news,Wit and wisdom of Germany’s anti-noise philosopher revealed to new readers,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/07/theodor-lessing-germany-anti-noise-philosopher-book
