12/25/2021,"Thousands of additional care workers are to be recruited from abroad to fill chronic gaps in the workforce, the government has announced after figures showed more than 40,000 social care staff had left the sector over the past six months. Immigration rules will be relaxed for care workers, care assistants and home care workers, who will be added to the Home Office’s shortage occupation list.  The Department of Health and Social Care said the pandemic had brought unprecedented challenges. The change follows a recommendation from the Migration Advisory Committee, which said there were “severe and increasing difficulties faced by the care sector”. Care workers who arrive on a 12-month health and care visa must receive an annual salary of at least £20,480 to qualify, with the measures expected to come into effect early next year. They will be entitled to bring dependants, including a partner and children. Priti Patel, the home secretary, said the sector was “experiencing unprecedented challenges prompted by the pandemic”, adding: “The changes we’ve made to the health and care visa will bolster the workforce and helping alleviate some of the pressures currently being experienced.” Health providers have warned of worsening staff shortages with a requirement for all frontline healthcare workers to be fully vaccinated against Covid by 1 April. The same was asked of care workers by 11 November. Earlier this month, the Nuffield Trust said the care sector was facing an extremely challenging winter of staff shortages. The health thinktank found staff numbers had fallen by about 42,000 between April and October. The Home Office also announced a visa scheme to allow seasonal horticultural workers to come to the UK would continue until the end of 2024, but the government added that it wanted to see a new plan from the sector to cut the reliance on foreign labour. There will be 30,000 visas available next year, with the number being tapered down from 2023. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said a review had found the reliance on foreign labour held down wages and was a disincentive to investment. George Eustice, the environment secretary, said a seasonal workforce long pre-dated membership of the EU but said there was a determination to improve pay and skills to attract UK workers. “We recognise that agriculture has unique and seasonal requirements for labour at harvest and have listened to our world leading fresh produce industry to understand their needs,” he said. Daisy Cooper, the Liberal Democrat’s health and social care spokesperson, said: “This measure is too little too late for everyone who has had their visits to a loved one in a care home cancelled this Christmas. Staff shortages in care homes have been at crisis point for months.“When Boris Johnson delivered Brexit he pulled the rug from under the care sector’s work force. Now, the paltry offer of a one-year visa will likely fail to attract the numbers of care workers we so desperately need.“We cannot afford another humiliating and damaging repeat of when a pitiful 27 EU lorry drivers applied for HGV visas in response to the driver shortage. The government needs to think again and offer three-year visas to carers with immediate effect.",News/Society,UK immigration rules to be eased as shortages of care workers worsen,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/24/uk-immigration-rules-to-be-ease-as-shortages-of-care-workers-worsen
12/25/2021,"British police have been testing out Tesla cars as part of a drive to electrify more of their fleet, and the results so far are promising, according to a Tesla spokesperson. Early findings show “great results” around the suitability of the firm’s Model 3 vehicle for emergency service operation, said Max Toozs-Hobson, emergency services lead at Tesla.  He told the Guardian that while the average blue light run in the UK was seven to 15 minutes, the Model 3 had been able to take part in runs that lasted four hours on active deployment under advanced driving conditions, and said that “it’s achievable to do over 200 miles of blue light advanced driving with the [Model 3]”. Positive results could lead to more Tesla Model 3 cars being adopted by UK police, paramedic and fire services. The trial began earlier this year when the electric car firm offered UK police an adapted and liveried version of its Model 3. The test comes as UK police look to invest in more electric-powered cars ahead of a 2030 government ban on new diesel and petrol motored vehicles. Tesla made a number of adaptations to the car, but according to Toozs-Hobson, the systems did not impact the car range. Running automatic number plate recognition for three hours would take less than a few miles of range off the car, he said, and the LED lights could run for days off the battery pack. The charging system was successful. Toozs-Hobson said he had “joined a traffic unit who got into the car with just 80 miles of range. We stopped at a V3 supercharger and gained 70% power in less than 20 minutes. This gave us another 5-6 hours of driving for the shift. Plus, this fill up cost less than £20”. However, the trial results were not all positive. Toozs-Hobson criticised the light bars found on emergency vehicles, saying that they were like “running with a parachute” on. He suggested integrating police lights into the car cabin, similar to many unmarked police cars, which he said would reduce drag and the drop in car value that comes from drilling holes into vehicle roofs. The Tesla Model 3 Performance, the vehicle type believed to have been used in these trials, is more expensive than non-electric or hybrid high-performance equivalents. A Tesla Model 3 Performance is available from £59,990, while a BMW 3 Series Saloon costs nearly half that at £33,250. However, high initial costs may also come with lower operating costs, reducing the total cost of the vehicle over its lifetime. Toozs-Hobson said that the public response to Tesla’s active units had been “mind-blowing” and that the firm would continue working with police ahead of the 2030 combustion motor ban. A government spokesperson said, “Over the next few years police forces across England and Wales will play a significant role in achieving the government’s net zero carbon ambition through the de-carbonisation programme for policing”. He added that “some forces have already made significant progress in decarbonising their fleet”.",News/Environment,UK police trial Tesla cars as fleets prepare for shift to electric,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/24/uk-police-trial-tesla-model-3-electric-cars
12/25/2021,"A total of 122,186 reported daily coronavirus cases have been recorded as of 9am Friday, according to the latest government figures, another record number of cases in a single day. The government said a further 1,171 people were hospitalised with the virus and 137 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid.  Meanwhile, ndata has emerged showing Covid infection levels have reached a new record high. An estimated 1.7 million people in the UK had Covid-19 in the week ending 19 December, the highest number since comparable figures began in autumn 2020, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The interim data, published on Friday, also showed that about one in 35 people in private homes in England had Covid in the week to 19 December, up from one in 45 in the seven days to 16 December. This is the highest estimate for England since the ONS began estimating community infection levels for England in May 2020, and is equivalent to about 1.5 million people. In London this rose to about one in 20 people likely to test positive for Covid-19, the highest proportion for any region in England, the ONS said. North-east England had the lowest proportion, at about one in 55. The ONS also said that Covid infections compatible with the Omicron variant had increased in all regions in England with “substantial regional variation”, with the highest rates in London and the lowest in the north-east. There will be no statistics on coronavirus cases or vaccinations on 25 and 26 December. On Thursday, as of 9am, 119,789 lab-confirmed Covid-19 cases were recorded in the UK, the government said.",News/World news,"UK hits new Covid record again with more than 120,000 daily cases",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/24/uk-hits-new-covid-record-again-more-than-120000-cases-recorded
12/25/2021,"In 2004 I met Brian Marshall while I was setting up a storytelling company of people with learning disabilities in Somerset. Brian, who has died aged 70, was the first to join, and his commitment never wavered. He revealed himself to be a natural and compulsive narrator with a genius for saying exactly the right words at the right time. “The thing is …” he pronounced at the end of a show at the grounds of Glastonbury Abbey “everyone’s got a story to tell!” To the local MP at a campaign meeting against cuts in mobility allowance, he said: “You’re going to leave people with disabilities staring at walls. And that’s not right.”  He went on to co-deliver projects in schools, residential homes and day centres, and to offer remarkable staff training through telling his life story. When the company became a charity, Open Storytellers, in 2009, he joined the board as a trustee. He had a deep well of experience and wisdom that cut through bureaucracy and jargon, and grounded the organisation in the values that he exemplified – respect for others, generosity, risk-taking and fun. Brian was born in Templecombe, Somerset, one of six children of Joan and Derek Marshall, who worked in various jobs during his childhood, including agricultural, factory and cleaning work. His early life was not easy. He was in and out of hospitals, and moved eventually to long stay institutions: first Norah Fry in Shepton Mallet, then Selwood hospital in Frome. The residents formed deep and lasting friendships, and one of the sadnesses for Brian after the inevitable closures was the sheer difficulty of keeping in touch. This was remedied when he co-led, along with Professor Dorothy Atkinson, a leading academic in life story work by people with learning disabilities from the Open University, a funded project to collect memories from both residents and staff. For a time Brian lived for a time in a group home in Frome and then relocated joyously to his own flat in the town, festooned with Liverpool FC memorabilia, and with a tiny yard for growing the tomatoes and sunflowers he loved. When he became too frail to cope independently, he accepted a move to residential care with his usual grace. Well known in Frome, Brian taught those who knew him how to laugh, how to embrace change, how to treat every challenge as new learning, with great humility and self awareness; and how to be a true and lasting friend. His autobiography, Great Strides, is available at the Openstorytellers website. Brian kept in touch with and is survived by his brother Richard, two nephews, Christopher and Lee, and niece, Justine.",News/Society,Brian Marshall obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/24/brian-marshall-obituary
12/25/2021,"Ihave been a cat lover my whole life. That is to say, I have never liked dogs. Or at least, this was the case until earlier this year. There was no conscious desire to beat the aversion – it just happened, and all it took was a puppy in an orange jacket, shortly after the end of lockdown. But before that, my low opinion of dogs. I decided at a young age that they were dangerous and uncouth – the pirates of the pet world who would cock their legs shamelessly on street corners and had great big wet dishcloths for tongues.  As a child, I remember clutching my mother’s coat as the neighbour’s dog growled at us every morning over the garden fence and bared its monstrous teeth. We had just emigrated from Lahore to a racially hostile Britain of the 1970s and this dog only made us feel more unwelcome. On top of that, my mother had been attacked when she was a girl; perhaps I saw her flinching every time a dog walked by and took on her fear as my own. I have spent a lifetime crossing roads, leaving cafes and making excuses to dog-owning friends so that I am never at close quarters. This hasn’t always been easy. There was one blood-curdling lunch invitation from a friend who had just bought a puppy. I imagined a yappy little thing so I went along but it turned out to be a great dane who charged around the dining table and stuck its tongue in all the tubs of hummus at once. Another time, a stranger invited me for coffee and at the end said we must do it again. “Yes,” I said, but just as he was leaving he added, “next time I’ll bring my Afghan hounds.” I made sure to hold my smile in place but I thought, “Well, that’s the end of that.” Then, my 10-year-old niece started asking for a puppy for her birthday and I thought, “Oh God, am I going to have to ghost my niece, too?” Thankfully, she lost interest in dogs and started asking for an axolotl. News stories of random maulings and child deaths kept my suspicions intact over the years and even if my visceral fear has lessened, there is still the disapproval of a dog’s ridiculously slobbering and ingratiatingly buoyant personality. The same goes for dog owners who assume you find their pet as lovable as they do. In the 1980s, when it was the rage to wear white trousers, a dog jumped on me while I sat on a park bench and left a permanent smear of mud across mine while its owner just stood and smiled. But then the pup in the orange jacket. I was on a tube train and a couple came into my carriage, the woman carrying it in her arms. The dog was so little it was shivering even though it was dressed in the orange padded jacket. I waited for the discomfort to kick in but as I watched it take in the world with big, overwhelmed eyes and curled up paws, I felt a shift which couldn’t have occurred in that moment but must have been the accumulation of an unconscious process. The couple sensed my interest and brought the puppy over for me to stroke, which made me bristle, but I gave it a quick pat on the head and then felt bereft when they got off the train. This was shortly after lockdown and I wrote it off as an aberration, born of so many months of isolation. But since then I have noticed that I no longer flinch when a dog walks past and increasingly throw backward glances at it. What’s led to this change? I think to myself, and can’t formulate an answer. Maybe some of us have been marked by social isolation in ways that can’t quite be rationalised yet. Living alone for so many months, I did find myself questioning opinions and beliefs that had, over the years, become absolutes: that I never get lonely, that neighbours are never there for you in London, that independence is always empowering, that nature doesn’t thrive in a city. The end of lockdown was a chance to reset and go back into the world slightly more joyfully, more open to things, even if most of the resolutions to work less, cook more and meditate every day quickly fell by the wayside. I’m not sure that dogs featured in this mental recalibration, but maybe being more open to things has shifted my prejudice towards them. Since the puppy on the train, I have found myself admiring the sleek silver fur of a greyhound resting in a sunny spot of a pavement cafe, and making eye contact with what I’d previously have dismissed as a scratty mongrel outside the supermarket. I’ll occasionally stop and make clucking noises at a mutt, ready to make friends, but it will be the one to turn its back on me or simply stare, as if it’s unsure. Dogs, I realise, are picky about humans too. Not so different from cats, after all.

12/25/2021,"Marc Weiner has two voices. There is his speaking voice, engaging and booming, sharpened over years in front of the camera as a TV news reporter. And then there is the voice in his head, normally ringing with the same positivity he exudes in everyday life. But when Weiner was left hanging after telling loved ones he needed a kidney – a handful got tested; none were a match – that voice took on a darker tone. “Do people not love me?” he wondered. Weiner, 56, found out he had bladder cancer in July 2015 and had his prostate, bladder and both of his kidneys removed the following year. After another tumor was later removed from his stomach, Weiner was cancer-free and optimistic: All he needed was to find a kidney donor.  But after finding no refuge in his friends and family, he looked at the numbers: more than 90,000 Americans are in need of a kidney transplant, with 13 people dying everyday waiting for a kidney. In New York state, the average wait time for a kidney from a deceased donor is seven to 10 years. Weiner didn’t like those numbers. He thought of his daughter, Lily, who was nine when he was diagnosed. He thought of the mornings he’d spend, waking up at the crack of dawn to hook himself up to a machine that drew out his blood over hours, filtered it for waste and pumped it back into his body. Dialysis helped to keep Weiner alive, but it was exhausting, and not a permanent fix. He was resolved. “Was I going to wait five, seven, 10 years on a list?” Weiner said. “Hell no.” Then, one day, a glimmer of hope appeared. Weiner’s wife, Lisa, heardabout a man named Robert Leibowitz in New Jersey. On a family trip to Disney World, Leibowitz had worn a shirt emblazoned with a message – “In Need of Kidney” – and his phone number. He found a donor. A plan hatched in Lisa’s mind. Lisa, a longtime advertising executive, was on a car ride back from Hershey Park when she got the call confirming the good news. She turned to her husband. “Oh my god,” she said. “They’re going to do it.” “What are you talking about?” he replied. “The billboard,” she said. On a sunny day in late August 2018, Weiner stood on the corner of Broadway and 47th Street in Times Square, where a 5,000-sq ft billboard bore his smiling face and a link to his new website. “My name is Marc,” the billboard read. “I need a Kidney. YOU can Help!” Weiner posed for a photo in front of the billboard with Lily, posted it to social media and, with hope in his heart, waited for one kind stranger. More than 1,800 people responded to Weiner’s call for a kidney, crashing the portal for prospective donors Weill Cornell Medicine had set up for him. Still, he couldn’t find a match. Only a small fraction of respondents were truly interested. But hiding among them was a person who would go on to change Weiner’s life – if not in the way he expected. It was about 3am on an August morning in 2018 when Mike Lollo, a slender man with close-cropped gray hair and a warm smile, read about Weiner’s billboard in the New York Post. The humanity of Weiner’s story appealed to Lollo, a retired NYPD cop. And so, within days, he was undergoing blood work and a 24-hour urine collection, preparing to give his kidney over to a man he’d never met. Lollo wasn’t a match for Weiner. But something had changed in his mind that day. If he was ready to undergo surgery to change one stranger’s life, he figured, why not do it for someone else instead? Lollo underwent the two-hour surgery that December, taking six weeks off work to recover. While people usually don’t donate their kidney to a stranger – most worry about the surgery; the scar; the costs; or panicky scenarios, where life might change without one of the organs with which they were born – Lollo joined a small but growing number of people in the United States who do. So when Weiner learned of Lollo’s gesture – a New York Post reporter had called him, asking for comment – he rushed to Lollo’s hospital room, brandishing a Kron chocolate basket and a wide smile. Weiner walked into the room, looking at Lollo in his gown, talking to his wifeand introduced himself. “I know who you are,” said Lollo, before he could finish. “That guy,” Weiner said, “He cared about me.” Mike Lollo was so moved by meeting Weiner and donating his own kidney that he decided to volunteer for the National Kidney Donor Organization. Later, he was named its president. Weiner, meanwhile, was beginning to realize the power of human connection. So, in late 2020, he came up with another plan. He launched a second billboard in Times Square, this time on Seventh Avenue and West 43rd Street. Weiner knew he still might not find a kidney, but he wondered if there were more Mike Lollos out there. Living kidney donations, oftentimes, are sparked by others speaking about their own donations. On 31 December, CBS News, Weiner’s employer, ran a story on This Morning documenting his journey. “If you’re in the spirit of giving, think about giving your kidney,” Weiner said on the broadcast. “You’re going to save a life, and, ultimately, who knows, you might help me out.” Four years on from when he launched his first billboard, Weiner had learned some lessons. He knew people might see the billboard, sign up and lose their nerve. So he and Lollo came up with a new system partnering people who signed up to donate with “mentors.” . Now, if a potential donor got cold feet; if they woke up in a cold sweat in the middle of the night wondering, “Why on earth am I giving someone I don’t know my kidney?” the mentor would be on call, to remind them the process was safe, having been through it themselves already. Humans need only one functioning kidney to live an active, healthy life, despite being born with two. For Hillary Baude, it was the thought of Weiner’s daughter that jolted her into action. She’d watched the This Morning report live on television, then spent the rest of the day watching it over and over on her iPad, while researching kidney donation. She knew all too well the pain that comes when you can’t provide a loved one the help they need. Baude and her husband, Jim, had their first child in 2013. They were supposed to have two. Ellie, born premature at 33 weeks, had an identical twin who died halfway through Baude’s pregnancy. Ellie’s first moments in the world were marked by pain. She had stopped growing around the time of her twin’s death, and was 13 inches long, weighing two pounds, three ounces. She had two holes in her heart. Five months after her birth, Ellie underwent open-heart surgery. The operation stabilized her, but concerns about her health lingered. Doctors indicated she was likely to have suffered brain damage. And her body bore a reminder of the sibling the world would never meet: she was diagnosed with type V cutis aplasia, a rare skin defect occurring in surviving twins. Ellie was born with no skin from her hip to her knees, symmetrical in length on both legs. The Baudes were able to get Ellie laser treatment that allowed her skin to expand over the exposed parts, but that would not be the end of the family’s health struggles. About a year after Ellie’s birth, Jim was diagnosed with prostate cancer. That’s when Baude started to run. Running from her grief, yes, but also running because she could. She’d strap Ellie into a running stroller and hit the streets. “I was like, ‘wow, all of these people around me are just going through these very difficult experiences. And I am healthy,” Baude said. “I have the ability to do this.” Jim made a full recovery from the prostate cancer, and Ellie defied doctor’s prognostications and is now a happy older sister to two-year-old Josie. But Baude kept running, eventually graduating to marathons, the compounding miles deepening her well of gratitude. Not long after she watched the CBS segment on Weiner, Baude’s mind was made up. His family deserved the same relief hers had experienced, she thought. And she had a kidney to spare. Baude wound up being a match for Weiner, but because it wasn’t the strongest match – some kidneys will last longer in some recipients than others – she didn’t end up giving her kidney to him. Instead, she decided to initiate a “kidney chain”: Her organ would go to someone else in need of a kidney, who had another willing recipient who wasn’t a match. That person’s kidney, like Baude’s, went to a stranger – and Weiner, thanks to Baude’s donation, got a “voucher” for a kidney he can cash in when his health permits, receiving a kidney from a donor who is an optimal match. Four more people who wanted to donate to Weiner completed testing, Lollo said, and plan to donate their kidneys to strangers. As Weiner waits on his kidney, he takes solace in knowing his efforts have helped to save at least six people’s lives. Lollo attributes the efforts to the mentorship program, which he believes could help eradicate the kidney waitlist if there was more awareness around donation. There are more than 253.8 million adults in the nation – most of whom presumably have a kidney to spare – according to the 2020 US Census. “If less than half of 1% of those people came forward,” Lollo said, “we would be able to find 100,000 (donors), I guarantee it.” Two weeks after her donation, Baude began running again – she was preparing for the New York City Marathon. When she ran the largest US marathon on 7 November 2021, she wanted to show people kidney donors could still be athletes. But finishing in under four hours wasn’t the only surprise she’d have that day. As Baude galloped through the streets of New York City, her blond ponytail flapping against her back, her husband secretly met up with Lollo and, for the first time, the Weiner family. They huddled together in a crowd on a packed city street, a makeshift family amid a sea of strangers wielding signs and smiles. At 1:50pm, as Baude came into view, they all shouted her name: “Hillary!” She locked eyes with Jim first, and then Lollo, who pointed to another man, a stranger who looked like a friend. “Ahh!” she yelped, noticing the face of the man she knew from the billboard. She embraced Weiner. They hugged, and Weiner turned to his wife and daughter, looking back at Baude incredulously. “One kidney!” he shouted. The group ducked into the first bar they found. Amid the humdrum of hugs and salutations, Baude ordered an IPA and fielded questions about the race from Weiner, who’d slipped into reporter mode. It felt like a family reunion. They laughed and exchanged stories. After about an hour, Weiner picked up the tab. “Thank you!” Hillary said. Weiner looked at her, astonished: “Are you kidding?” he asked. When the Weiners drove back that evening, they left the marathon knowing they were approaching their own finish line. Because of the chain initiated by Baude’s donation, in early 2022 Weiner will finally receive a kidney. Lily, his only daughter, is 15 now, a high school sophomore, and he’s excited to watch her get older. The dark voice in his head had quieted. Back inside the dimly-lit bar, Baude and her husband chatted with Steve Wilson, Baude’s kidney mentor, but a piece of the Weiners remained. The bar was called Lily’s.

12/25/2021,"There are three spectres haunting Boris Johnson as the prime minister spends a tense Christmas monitoring hospitalisation data in order to make a call on whether or not to cancel New Year’s Eve celebrations and place new restrictions on the country from January. Cabinet Office sources have suggested there will now be no update before Christmas to the potential reopening of an investigation by Lord Geidt, the adviser on ministerial standards, into Johnson’s flat redecoration.  That will make it a hat-trick of potentially serious censures awaiting Johnson in the new year – firstly from Geidt, who is said to be considering his position, as well as from Sue Gray, the senior civil servant investigating Downing Street lockdown gatherings. The third and potentially most serious is one by the parliamentary standards commissioner Kathryn Stone into Johnson’s donations to cover the refurbishment of his residence. Geidt’s investigation, which he undertook in May, cleared Johnson of wrongdoing over a £52,000 donation to the Conservatives from the party donor Lord Brownlow to cover the costs of redecorating the No 11 flat he shares with his wife, Carrie, and their two children. Geidt reported that Johnson told him “he knew nothing about such payments” until February 2021. However, WhatsApp messages that emerged during an Electoral Commission inquiry into the funding showed that Johnson had been in direct contact with Brownlow in November 2020. Downing Street has said Johnson only knew Brownlow was handling the donations, rather than funding them. Pressure is piling on Geidt from opposition parties and campaigners to make a call on whether to censure Johnson – or resign if there are grounds to believe he was misled. Tom Brake, from the campaign group Unlock Democracy, said the silence from Geidt could mean one of three things. “Either the PM has refused to allow Lord Geidt to open a fresh inquiry, or the PM is stonewalling him, or he has interviewed the PM and is waiting to publish his report. Whichever it is, the public deserves to know. Lord Geidt should confirm, without further delay, whether our PM subscribes to the Nolan principles of integrity, accountability, openness and honesty.” The Liberal Democrat said Geidt’s position was becoming compromised. “We cannot allow another public servant to be dragged down by Johnson’s desire to cover up the avalanche of sleaze that is engulfing his government,” said Brake. Geidt is said to have asked Johnson for the WhatsApp messages exposed by the Electoral Commission. He is also said to have been frustrated by the emergence of the new material, with suggestions he could consider his position if he concludes he has been misled by the prime minister. A resignation by Geidt would be a further embarrassment. Johnson’s previous ministerial standards adviser, Alex Allan, stood down in November 2020 after the prime minister ignored his findings that the home secretary, Priti Patel, had bullied staff. Stone, who looks into standards breaches by MPs, has not yet made a call on whether to investigate Johnson. Stone said she would not investigate until the Electoral Commission had finalised its inquiries, but has now been urged by MPs to do so. That could be the investigation that has the most serious implications for Johnson – Stone has sanction powers, including the ability to suspend an MP, which can lead to a recall petition and a potential byelection. Though highly unlikely to result in the prime minister losing his Uxbridge seat, it would at the very least add more fuel to backbenchers who believe Johnson could become an electoral liability.",News/Politics,Past presents future threat for Johnson as investigations loom,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/24/past-presents-future-threat-for-johnson-as-investigations-loom
12/25/2021,"Christmas is an NBA holiday, but this year the NFL is taking aim. Besides two tasty Christmas Eve games, the league has a pair of films coming down the chimney that will rival any Hallmark TV feature for sentimentality. Coming only to theaters is American Underdog, the Lionsgate biopic on the former NFL quarterback Kurt Warner – a rags-to-riches tale after my own heart. I moved to Missouri for college when Warner washed up on the 1998 St Louis Rams roster as a 27-year-old third stringer and watched every game of his breakout 1999 season. Years later as a Sports Illustrated cub reporter I’d vibe with pro football insider Michael Silver over his 2000 Warner biography All Things Possible, the text upon which American Underdog is based.  Viewers who know Warner’s story will be relieved to know the script hits all the major beats: the “Kill Kurt” college drills that instilled his patience in the pocket, the arena league football experience that honed his viper-quick release, coach Dick Vermeil’s weepy “We will rally around Kurt Warner” news conference that came after a low-blow hit to the knee by Chargers safety Rodney Harrison wiped out Rams starter Trent Green. As for viewers who don’t know the story, oh yes, it’s all true. Warner really did stock grocery store shelves after going undrafted. His beloved future in-laws really were killed by a tornado that swept through their Arkansas home. And when Warner finally did get his shot he really was that freakin’ good, like some 100-rated passing god that could only be created in a video game. Also premiering Christmas Day is All Madden, the much-anticipated Fox TV documentary on the American icon. Like American Underdog, this too is a nostalgia trip, a chance to spend 75 minutes with a genuine character who’s been fairly reclusive since his 2008 retirement. Co-directed by Fox Sports reporter Tom Rinaldi, undisputed champion of the soft-focus interview, All Madden doesn’t offer much in the way of story twists; most who’ve switched on a football game in the last 40 years are doubtless familiar with Madden’s success as a coach, analyst and pitchman. Where the doc surprises is in whom it gets to talk about Madden – not least boss Rupert Murdoch, who paid a king’s ransom to bring Madden to Fox after outbidding CBS for NFL broadcast rights. Besides Murdoch, among the doc’s three dozen interviewees, insights range from Madden’s wife and sons (What? He has a family?) to ex-Cowboys QB turned Fox NFL analyst Troy Aikman. “John Madden narrated my career,” he says. Madden was in the booth for Warner’s epic 1999 season, which saw “Pop Warner” pace the league in touchdown passes and QB rating while leading the Rams past the Tennessee Titans in Super Bowl XXIV. Along the way he became one of 10 players to be named MVP of the regular season and the Super Bowl in the same year. Most memorably, he brought the arena league experience to the NFL, hanging in the pocket just long enough to hit an in-stride Isaac Bruce or Az-Zahir Hakim. American Underdog tarries in the fallow years before his Rams breakthrough, but spends most of its 112 minutes homing in on the romance between Kurt and Brenda Warner – the original ride-or-die. (They are executive producers on the film.) St Louis Rams fans, who should feel seen by directors Andrew and Jon Erwin, will vividly remember Brenda calling into sports talk shows to defend her man. When they first met, Kurt was an overlooked QB at second-tier Northern Iowa, and Brenda was an ex-Marine single mother of two. The surprise here is the spot-on casting. Zachary Levi nails Kurt’s sweetness as much as Anna Paquin does Brenda’s toughness. But the revelation is Hayden Zaller as Zachary Warner, the son who was blinded after his biological father dropped him as an infant. And then there’s Dennis Quaid as Vermeil, a choice that will make football movie buffs who remember him as the over-the-hill quarterback in Any Given Sunday feel ancient. Besides the understated title, there isn’t much to quibble with American Underdog. (Although I could see Mike Martz, the chatty brains behind the Greatest Show on Turf attack, feeling salty about doppelgänger Chance Kelly not getting more lines…) If that hero’s journey sometimes feels like a faith walk, it’s because the Warners make no secret of their profound Christian belief. (He famously thanked Jesus on live TV after the Super Bowl win.) In another film, the religiosity might feel heavy handed. But in this one, you can’t say it isn’t earned given how miraculously things turned out for Warner, a Pro Football Hall of Famer who might well be the best undrafted player, if not the greatest Cinderella story in sports. That he continues to prosper on television is a testament to Madden’s lasting impact as a teacher who did more to demystify the game than anyone. He did this not only with plainspoken commentary, but with graphics innovations like the telestrator, which allowed him to scribble on our TV screens the way he might do on a blackboard. Even the Madden video game franchise has had pronounced effect on the camera angles and graphics presentations used in live games. And then there’s the stuff you forget about Madden: that he hosted Saturday Night Live, that he was second only to Michael Jordan as a pitchman. Sprinkling some of those classic commercials was a nice touch, as was the conceit of watching Madden watch himself through the years, and watch some of what his admirers had to say about him. When Mike Madden gets going about his love for his father – “All of your careers have been Hall of Fame careers, even your role as father” – well, the line opens the floodgates as suddenly as American Underdog’s Martz telling Warner he believes in him just before siccing him on Ray Lewis’s Baltimore Ravens. As Covid threatens to shut down sports again, you could do worse than tuck American Underdog and All Madden. If anything, they lay bare the paradox at the heart of football, showing how a game that produces so much brutality can really make you feel all the feels.",Sport/Sport,American Underdog and All Madden: holiday weepies bare the NFL’s heart,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/24/american-underdog-all-madden-nfl-christmas
12/25/2021,"Ho, ho … oh no. This second Covid Christmas will not be a huge improvement from the first for many in the UK. More than 600,000 people will be forced to self-isolate on Christmas Day after a record 119,789 tested positive for Covid, the highest daily figure since the pandemic began. Officials say the self-isolation figure could rise to 750,000 as the Omicron variant continues to drive a record daily number of new cases. While not being able to spend Christmas with loved ones will be devastating for most, some people are turning to unique methods to keep the festive spirit alive. Here are four things to look out for if you’re self-isolating over Christmas.  Self-isolation at Christmas will probably leave you feeling alone, but you’re far from the only one. You can join the comedian Sarah Millican’s #JoinIn Twitter hashtag on Twitter and speak to others in your position. Now in its 11th year, #JoinIn is a space for people who have not chosen to be alone but find themselves on their own on Christmas Day. With hundreds of thousands of people unable to see loved ones because of Covid, the chat is likely to be busier than ever. Instead of drinks at the local pub, those self-isolating can order them for delivery. From pre-made cocktails to special cases of wine, there are boozy options to suit all tastes, so bring the bar home. There are plenty of livestream events to attend from the comfort of your own home, with extensive listings on Eventbrite and DesignMyNight. Whether it is tuning in for midnight mass at Westminster Abbey, cook-along events, or comedy shows, there is something for everyone. A small joy of self-isolation is not having to compromise (or share) what you eat on Christmas Day. Whether it’s having an entire pizza to yourself to spending the day cooking a roast with all the trimmings just how you like it, don’t hold back. It is the season to indulge, after all. There is also no need to limit yourself to grocery delivery slots or takeaway apps. For those feeling creative, it is worth seeing if you can order recipe boxes from one of your local restaurants or specialised companies and make a delicious meal.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Four ways to celebrate Christmas Day if you are forced to self-isolate,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/24/four-ways-to-celebrate-christmas-day-if-you-are-forced-to-self-isolate
12/25/2021,"My friend Andrew Garrett, musical instrument maker, conservator and restorer, who has died aged 83, was one half of the Clayson & Garrett partnership and the National Trust’s adviser on the conservation of musical instruments. Andrew, reading history, met Richard Clayson, reading English, at Oxford, where they built their first harpsichord in their last undergraduate year. Richard playing piano and organ did not have the same opportunities for music-making as Andrew, a violinist. Their musical taste was baroque, instrument hire was expensive – why not make their own harpsichord?  That first instrument created a stir in Oxford in 1962. The harpsichord-maker Michael Thomas invited them to work with him in his workshop and collection at Hurley Manor, near Maidenhead in Berkshire. The spartan lodging was a converted Thames barge and the cold endured in the severe winter of 1962-63 was long remembered. After this brief and idiosyncratic further education the pair were able to move to Richard’s home village of Lyminge, near Folkestone in Kent, to set up independently. In 1969, after six years making harpsichords and clavichords to Thomas’s and their own ideas, assisted by the cabinetmaker Ted Burren, they changed direction, becoming pioneers in the UK of copying surviving historical instruments rather than reimagining a “modern” harpsichord. Andrew and Richard’s long association with Alfred Deller’s Stour Music festival in Kent had introduced them to historically informed performance, especially in the Netherlands, where the harpsichordist and conductor Gustav Leonhardt was at the heart of the early music movement. Leonhardt was a significant influence, advising and encouraging them during their bold transition. Similarly oriented players in Britain, such as Trevor Pinnock and Colin Tilney, commissioned instruments, and by the mid-70s Andrew and Richard were making harpsichords after Flemish, Italian and English originals. All were prized for their immaculate craftsmanship and refinement of adjustment. Andrew’s achievement in continuing the business after Richard’s tragically early death in 1987 was heroic. Both were active in hiring instruments and influential in establishing the use of historical temperaments in tuning. From 1982 until 2016 Andrew was the National Trust’s adviser on the conservation of musical instruments. In this role he transformed both the care and state of knowledge of these holdings; more than 1200 instruments of vastly different kinds and conditions were surveyed and catalogued. Adventures when touring and hiring, or the discovery in a granary of an 18th-century harpsichord untouched for 200 years, were points of departure for Andrew’s delightful way with a story. Never predictable, he will now often be the cause of affectionate anecdote in others. At a conservators’ day to introduce the work of the conservation experts to National Trust staff, Andrew opened his six-minute presentation with a picture of his beloved Citroën DS Safari to illustrate the dilemmas arising in the use and conservation of historic artefacts. Andrew was born in Halifax, west Yorkshire, the son of Mona (nee Granby) and the Rev Robert Garrett. Before Lincoln College, Oxford, he attended Lancing college, West Sussex, on a music scholarship. He is survived by his wife, Paddy Fraser, whom he first met in Leeds in 1959 and married in Rome in 1976.",Arts/Music,Andrew Garrett obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/24/andrew-garrett-obituary
