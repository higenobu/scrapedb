12/14/2021,"A decade of reforms to save the Murray Darling Basin could be undermined by New South Wales’ plans to license too much flood water harvesting, with insiders warning NSW’s processes will result in irrigators being licensed to take billions of litres of flows without proper environmental assessment. Two members of the four-person Healthy Floodplains Review committee, which hears appeals from irrigators about their proposed flood plain water entitlements, say the system is “sloppy”, “flawed” and should be reviewed immediately.  They say over the last 12 months the committee has been swamped with more than 400 appeals, involving 1,300 separate flood plain harvesting structures; the committee is overwhelmed and applications are often accompanied by poor evidence. Irrigators, they say, are now “consultant shopping” in order to achieve outcomes many times larger than the initial assessment by the Natural Resources Access Regulator, which conducted an on-the-ground survey of dams and other structures used in flood plain harvesting. The two members – the NSW Farmers Association member, Xavier Martin and the Nature Conservation Council’s representative, Bev Smiles – have written to the head of the NSW department responsible to detail their grave concerns. The other members of the committee are both irrigators: one is appointed by NSW Irrigators and the other independent chair is a cotton farmer. The department disputes the members’ concerns, saying it has had two probity reviews of the committee and both have found the appeals process robust. The NSW Irrigators’ Council said it was important to keep flood plain harvesting in perspective and that the current average annual take is 350-390 gigalitres – about 3% of northern Basin inflows. “This will be the largest removal of water from irrigators to the environment since the Basin Plan, and will be a difficult adjustment for farmers losing water access, but everyone agrees flood plain harvesting needs to be reduced, licensed and metered,” chief executive Claire Miller said. The question is how to do it. The committee members’ letters were obtained by Guardian Australia after a call for papers by the Greens in the NSW Upper House. The result, they warn, is that NSW could be licensing an unsustainable amount of water that will have long-term implications for the future health of the river system and wetlands in western NSW. Southern basin farmers are also concerned that they will be left short on their allocations of water from the river because of the reduced flows reaching the river. The growth in flood plain harvesting – the practice of capturing small floods as they move across plains toward the river, using giant storages, levees and channels – has been blamed for the 20% shortfall of water in the Murray Darling river system compared to what was expected. Over the last three decades the practice of taking this water – which can be taken for free (unlike river water which requires a licence) – has increased. Large cotton farms have laser-levelled plains and built huge shallow storages which are fed by elaborate systems to direct water into them. Now the NSW government wants to license flood plain harvesting as required under the Murray Darling Basin plan, a move which both environmentalists and farmers agree is necessary. But working out how much should be licensed to ensure a sustainable river has been hampered by poor data, many unlicensed structures and uncertainty about the impact of climate change. As the first step in the licensing, the NSW Natural Resources Access Regulator (NRAR) sent staff to western NSW to inspect structures, with the idea being that “historical take” via structures approved by 1994 would be permitted. Other structures will need to be removed. In recognition that farmers were already capturing water in this way, the NSW government said licences would be free, but it will effectively cap the practice in the future. The licences are probably worth millions; conversely, if the NSW government has to buy back licences due to overallocation, it will potentially cost millions. An indicator of the value, Smiles said, could be seen in sales of major agribusinesses in the last six months, which have included price tags of $3-4m for draft flood plain harvesting entitlements. Initially, the plan was to get the licences in place by June 2021 and NRAR worked toward this deadline. But this proved too ambitious. Instead there have been a flood of appeals to the HFR committee and a parliamentary inquiry which will report this week. Martin, who joined the committee in May as the NSW Farmers representative, wrote a scathing letter soon after joining. He says the committee is relying on flawed information from the department and from applicants, yet is under pressure to approve applications. “It is inappropriate to approve applications where significant evidence exists as to the inaccuracy of the information supplied,” he wrote. For example, Martin said the remote-sensing imagery used by the committee could not adequately differentiate between irrigated and dryland fields and was in some cases causing errors of greater than 100%, leading to bigger water allocations. He said the committee was also “dealing with returning ‘errors’ on a regular basis, which are clearly linked to lost or inadequate departmental records”. “This has resulted in ‘consultant shopping’ and multiple submissions returning five or 10 times or more,” he said. This in turn has led to “stretch shopping” with applicants disputing the relevant rainfall measurement sites, the area from which water is harvested, the size of reservoirs and assessments of the size of the pumps installed. He said some registrations of interest were unsigned and statutory declarations as to the truth of the information provided often simply referred to the consultant’s opinion. He also said he had concerns with some unapproved structures being licensed even though there had been no environmental assessment of any kind. “Despite the oft-repeated desire that the Review Committee act with “consistency” and “get it right” these goals were often in conflict and not resolved by evidence, ….including ambiguous declarations, poor photos, inconclusive site verification,” Martin said. Smiles has expressed grave concerns about the departmental models which are used to calculate the volumes. She described them as “a black box” and warned that they could result in allocations above a safe level.

Implementing the policy now would reduce the practice by more than 25%, or about 100 gigalitres in the northern basin, a spokesperson said. “The committee has to date provided advice on all cases brought before it, with advice on more than 95% of cases decided on consensus. In more than 90% of cases, the committee’s recommendations align with recommendations made by the [Department of Planning, Industry and Environment],” she said. “Fewer than 1,000 were contested by landholders. That means more than 85% of assessments were uncontested – an impressive outcome given the complexity and scale of this work over such a long time period,” she said.",News/Australia news,Murray Darling basin: ‘flawed’ floodwater giveaway could reverse decade of reforms,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/14/murray-darling-basin-flawed-floodwater-giveaway-could-reverse-decade-of-reforms
12/14/2021,"David Baddiel: Social Media, Anger and Us (BBC Two) kicks off with a shocker, broadcasting CCTV footage of the moment the Smithy family, who have 2.5 million followers on TikTok, had their car firebombed on their drive. The family blame trolls for the attack, having received online criticism and threats. “It’s our life, and we put it out there for people to see,” says the ex-builder turned social media star Nick, who explains that he feels he has put his family in danger. This is a thoughtful and mature documentary that considers whether online rage has real-world consequences. Baddiel has experienced antisemitic abuse on Twitter, where he has 785,000 followers. He has had brushes with what is called “cancel culture” and “callout culture”, when users have criticised his use of blackface on TV in the 1990s, for which he has apologised. He is also a self-confessed social media addict – by which he really means Twitter, his primary focus here – and self-aware enough to admit that while he feels he needs it to promote his work, he also understands that he has a psychological need for an audience, and by extension, for audience approval.  Partly, this is a litany of how bad for us social media can be. Evidence suggests that hateful speech on Twitter leads to an increase in incidences of hate crimes on the streets. Jaron Lanier, who wrote the book Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now, argues that social media brings out the worst in people, increasing paranoia and irritability. Baddiel has his brain scanned while he is shown supportive and critical tweets (a more dour BBC version of the US chatshow slot Celebrities Read Mean Tweets). Unsurprisingly, the nice posts get the dopamine-based reward network all fired up; intriguingly, the negative ones compel his body to physical action. The theory is that it’s triggering a fight or flight response. There are careful examples given of what can go wrong, how reputations can be trashed and even national identities altered. Online identity is a ripe subject, and one that feels as if it could have its own series. In one particularly moving segment, Baddiel speaks to his daughter, Dolly, about her experiences with anorexia as a teenager, and how crude notions of identity, something social media if not encourages then allows to flourish, might affect malleable adolescent brains. It is profound and honest. It is also complicated, and a great irony is that Twitter can reduce any argument to a screaming match about the most basic elements of that discussion. Baddiel dips a tentative toe into cancel culture, speaking to the comedian Phil Wang about abuse Wang received online after he made a joke about Jeremy Corbyn on Have I Got News for You. More enlightening is the conversation with comedian Athena Kugblenu, who takes a different tack in a chat about the England cricketer Ollie Robinson, who apologised for racist and sexist tweets posted when he was 18. Kugblenu argues that racism should not be treated as a rite of passage. It is the kind of balanced conversation you don’t see much of on, well, you know where. Eventually, Baddiel agrees to give up Twitter for two weeks, to see if it makes him feel better. He hands over his phone, has the passwords changed, and explains that somebody else will be managing his account for the duration of his absence. While the historical, societal and cultural contexts around social media are fascinating and explained with some insight, it is worth pointing out that this is about the experiences of people on social media who have considerable followings, who are able to get someone else to “manage” their account while they’re away. I’m not sure the “Us” in the title is reflective of the British public as a whole. That doesn’t make this film less interesting, only less universal. It is estimated that about 24% of Britons use Twitter, though you would imagine that figure to be far higher, given how dominant it has become. It is not the real world – not yet, at least. But just as I begin to feel bleak about all these bright people being made to feel miserable and anxious by a platform from which they cannot extricate themselves, Baddiel finishes the film with a beautiful touch. He posts about his father, who is ill with dementia. People rally round, send messages of support, show the empathy we worry will be lost. The nice side of social media is still there, if you look for it.

12/14/2021,"Pep Guardiola believes it is “ridiculous” that any credit for Raheem Sterling’s resurgent Manchester City form should go to the manager for dropping him. Sterling’s winner in Saturday’s 1-0 victory over Wolves was his 100th Premier League goal and a fifth in the 27-year-old’s last eight games. Yet Guardiola dismissed the notion this was due to the forward being left out during the closing phase of last season and the start of this one. “I would like to say yes for my ego and for a better contract for the next seasons,” he said. “I am sorry – that is the most ridiculous thing; all this credit is for the player.  “I am going to reveal a secret: when we played Aston Villa [a 2-1 win on 1 December] the day before we have 12 players and he was not selected and on the day [Ilkay] Gündogan had a pain in his back and could not travel and Raheem played. Just take a look at the first 15-20 minutes he played – it was the best 15-20 minutes maybe from the last months. I can pretend I know everything but that [form belongs] absolutely to the players. I want more from him but I want more from Gündogan, I want more from Kevin [De Bruyne], I want more even from Bernardo [Silva], from Rodri.” Guardiola referenced Max Verstappen’s Formula One championship triumph on Sunday when the intervention of the safety car allowed him to overtake Lewis Hamilton and clinch the title. “Verstappen and Lewis are incredible champions but sometimes success doesn’t depend on you,” he said. “Something else decides if there is a winner. “The players have to fight like Verstappen and Hamilton have until the end. In the end a law or a VAR or a bad decision can happen and you don’t win. What you have to do – like Raheem has in the last games or these incredible two athletes from Formula One have done – is never give up.” City host Leeds tomorrow with only Ferran Torres unavailable because of injury and would extend their lead at the top to four points with victory.",Sport/Football,Pep Guardiola laughs off credit for Raheem Sterling’s return to form,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/13/pep-guardiola-laughs-off-credit-for-raheem-sterlings-return-to-form-manchester-city
12/14/2021,"Steven Gerrard has admitted Aston Villa will take a player’s vaccine status into consideration when drawing up their list of January transfer targets. With Covid disrupting the football calendar to an extent not seen for months, Villa’s manager was asked whether he would think twice about moving for a player who had not been jabbed.  Although Gerrard began by saying he had not “really given that any thought yet”, he went on to explain that it would be factored in. He said two players and two staff members had Covid at the moment but that most of his squad were double-jabbed and that he was due to receive his booster on Wednesday. “We are very thorough and detailed in terms of our recruitment process,” Gerrard said. “I’ve been really impressed with Johan [Lange, the sporting director] and the guys around him in recruitment and scouting in terms of the details and work I’ve seen so far. We look at everything. So I’m sure it will come up. “But we’ll obviously make decisions as and when we decide a certain person is the one who could come in and make us better. “We’ll go across it with a fine-toothed comb. But I don’t think it’s right for me to comment on if I would or wouldn’t in that situation. But it would certainly come into conversations in the background.”",Sport/Football,Steven Gerrard: players’ vaccine status will be part of Aston Villa transfer talks,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/13/steven-gerrard-player-vaccine-status-will-be-part-of-aston-villa-transfer-talks
