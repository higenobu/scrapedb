5/16/2022,"Chelsea’s Abramovich era has launched the careers of many promising footballers into the stratosphere. It has also halted a few in their tracks. Steve Sidwell, Scott Parker and Danny Drinkwater all left clubs where they were hot properties to sign for Chelsea, where they spent varying portions of their prime years watching blankly from the dugout. To this list we can add Ross Barkley, trusted to take a penalty but nothing more on Saturday by a manager for whom he has played 428 minutes this season. Five years after moving to west London, Barkley has started fewer league games for Chelsea than he did in his final season at Everton, and has had as many managers as he has scored league goals. Not every talented youngster will fulfil their potential; not every transfer will be a success. But it’s hard to think back to Barkley’s breakout years and not lament the scattergun stockpiling in which football’s super-clubs can afford to indulge. Alex Hess Match report: Chelsea 0-0 Liverpool (5-6 pens) Two straight defeats have taken Burnley back into the relegation zone and Thursday’s visit to Aston Villa has assumed monumental proportions. There was room for optimism in a battling performance at Tottenham that arguably deserved a draw, though. “I am really proud of the group,” Mike Jackson said. “They had a right go today. I’ve seen a group that was fighting and had spirit.” A point at Villa Park will keep their fate in their hands. Jackson will have to decide whether to stick with the five-man back line that largely blunted Spurs, or whether to be more expansive and go for the early goal that might make life considerably easier. There is the added complication that, unusually, they played Villa at home nine days ago and were well beaten. Jackson must get the formula right but has shown an ability to set up a team that can handle the fight. Nick Ames Match report: Tottenham 1-0 Burnley Wilfried Zaha is enjoying fruitful times. As his powers peak, so do his returns. More finisher than creator now, Zaha’s 13 league goals this season is a career high. His previous best (11) came last year. But that less welcome part of his game – the side that sees him engage with baying crowds – remains. At Villa Park, Zaha did so with a beaming smile but it is still energy best channelled elsewhere. “This is part of Wilfried, his character, his personality,” explained Patrick Vieira. “It is a strength and a weakness at the same time. He is a target player and has to manage his mind, to keep that energy, that strength to allow him to make the difference in the last third.” Vieira knows that when Zaha mismanages things, life becomes easier for his opponents. “It’s a sideshow,” Steven Gerrard said. “He had a really quiet afternoon. We dealt with him really well.” Sam Dalling Match report: Aston Villa 1-1 Crystal Palace Pascal Struijk’s added-time equaliser for Leeds not only changes the dynamics surrounding the final week of the relegation battle but the entire mentality around Elland Road. Just a few minutes before Struijk scrambled home Joe Gelhardt’s cross, deafening renditions of Marcelo Bielsa’s name could be heard before the home supporters turned their ire on the board. It threatened to overshadow the bigger challenge at hand for Leeds, given how sacking Bielsa in February remains an incredible gamble that remains grossly unpopular with large swathes of Leeds fans. But as Struijk headed home and Elland Road erupted, the mood changed, as did the permutations. Burnley could change the whole script again if they get a result at Aston Villa on Thursday night but for the first time in a few weeks, Leeds supporters can look at the table with tentative confidence. If momentum really is a thing in sport then Struijk, the unlikeliest of heroes, has ensured Leeds have at least a sliver of it with one game remaining. Aaron Bower Match report: Leeds 1-1 Brighton It’s been a strange season for Leicester. Last year’s FA Cup win came off the back of two strong league campaigns, and it looked like a young, talented, improving squad would push on again. But though things haven’t turned out like that, they haven’t wasted their time. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall has established himself, James Maddison has rediscovered himself – and Harvey Barnes – scorer of two fine goals – is a better player now than in August. But at some point soon, and despite his brace, they must replace Jamie Vardy. In an ideal world, his role from now on would be as rotation player and impact sub. The question is whether Patson Daka is ready to step up. Though he has shown flashes of immense ability – at both Leicester and RB Salzburg – he has struggled in recent months. The onus is now on him to find the consistency it’ll take to displace a club legend. Daniel Harris  Match report: Watford 1-5 Leicester Manchester City’s injury worries in defence are well documented, but it was interesting last week to see Fernandinho support the idea that youngsters CJ Egan-Riley and Lucas Mbete deserved some game time in the title run-in. At West Ham, Pep Guardiola opted for experience, with Fernandinho starting at centre-back. The Brazilian is a legend at City but increasingly looking like a weak link, with Michail Antonio and Jarrod Bowen exposing the 37-year-old on the counter. Both West Ham’s goals capitalised on the space in behind and Fernandinho was also wasteful with the ball, including a poor back-pass that might have led to a third Hammers goal. Fernandinho deserves some sort of send-off before his return to Brazil this summer but it would be a shock to see him deployed in defence again for City’s crucial final game against Aston Villa. Michael Butler Match report: West Ham 2-2 Manchester City It’s hard to know what to make of Wolves. They’re far more enjoyable to watch under Bruno Lage than they were when Nuno Espírito Santo was in charge. And yet 37 goals in 37 games – the fewest of any side outside the bottom three – is almost as miserable as last season’s 36 in 38, the lowest outside the bottom four. Something has to change, and Lage will hope he has the internal solutions. After 10 months out with injury, Pedro Neto is back, and will be much the better for a full pre-season. But the form of Raúl Jiménez must be a worry, his 44 appearances yielding only nine goals, eight yellow cards, and two red cards. The hope is that he is building back confidence and sharpness after a long time out as a result of a potentially life-threatening head injury, but if he does not start next season well, his manager will – reluctantly, no doubt – need an alternative. Daniel Harris  Match report: Wolves 1-1 Norwich Just when it seemed Everton had edged their way to safety, they returned to the farce that has dragged them down all season. Two red cards and some desperate defending left Frank Lampard’s team needing something from Thursday at home to Crystal Palace and next Sunday at Arsenal to stay ahead of Burnley and Leeds. In the Goodison stands, Joe Royle and Peter Reid, both playing legends, with Royle a former manager, looked on, while the chairman, Bill Kenwright, looked positively tortured alongside them. Each of those famous Evertonians would recognise the mayhem that can grip their beloved club. It had briefly seemed that Lampard had harnessed the chaos, and Everton fans have responded warmly enough to his leadership. But his team still have no recognisable approach and lack discipline. Burnley’s and Leeds’s problems mean Everton will probably survive but a tough close-season awaits. Farce, chaos and mayhem rarely add up to sustained success. John Brewin  Match report: Everton 2-3 Brentford The England coach, Sarina Wiegman, was at Wembley on Sunday and will surely have learned far more from this high-stakes FA Cup final than any number of bloodless qualifiers. Keira Walsh and Alex Greenwood both excelled in defeat for Manchester City; Millie Bright and Jess Carter both advanced their cases for Chelsea. But the real bright spot was City winger Lauren Hemp, who feels increasingly pivotal to England’s chances this summer. The next big women’s game at Wembley will be the Euro 2022 final. Will England be there? Jonathan Liew Match report: Chelsea 3-2 Manchester City In August 1974, Liverpool beat Leeds United 6-5 on penalties to win the Charity Shield – the first of 26 shootouts in which they’ve competed. Of those, a quite ridiculous 19 have been won, including two European Cup finals, two FA Cup finals and three League Cup finals. Two of them have come this season, at the end of goalless draws against Chelsea. On the face of things, what happened in, say, Rome in 1984 has nothing whatsoever to do with what happened at Wembley on Saturday. But an overall success rate of 73.08% cannot possibly be a coincidence, and instead speaks volumes about Liverpool’s mythology and self-mythologising – veins into which Jürgen Klopp has tapped so astutely. Of course, all professional footballers are capable of beating a goalkeeper with a free shot from 12 yards, but Klopp has given those who play for him confidence, entitlement and aggression, their sense of history and destiny bordering on the messianic – and they are not finished yet.

5/16/2022,"If it felt like a long time coming, that’s because it has been. Amid the gaudy pomp and ceremony, the Queen’s speech contained a series of pledges that could substantially improve life for millions of renters across the UK. Sitting against an almost comically gilded backdrop, Prince Charles spoke of a government ready to “improve the regulation of social housing, strengthen the rights of tenants and ensure better quality safer homes”. The proposed renters’ reform bill contains one particularly eye-catching commitment. For years, housing activists and charities have fought for the abolition of section 21 of the Housing Act (1988), an insidious piece of Thatcherite legislation that became better known as “no-fault evictions”. The premise is simple enough. Under the terms of section 21, private landlords have been able to evict tenants without a reason, and giving just two months notice. This isn’t the first time such a promise has been made. In the spring of 2019, Theresa May’s government sounded its intention to scrap no-fault evictions, after the then housing minister, James Brokenshire, apparently experienced a Damascene moment of clarity during a visit to a homeless people’s shelter in Bristol. But the following three years have only seen the practice intensify, despite the brief lull occasioned by the temporary pandemic eviction ban. According to research by Shelter, the UK’s largest housing charity, an extra 200,000 private renters in England were served with no-fault evictions since the first commitment to scrap them was issued, at a rate of one every seven minutes. Change was supposed to arrive finally in 2021, before being shelved until last week. Though the latest pledge has been broadly welcomed by campaigners and housing charities, most have struck a note of caution. Promises are easily made. Guiding them through into law is another matter entirely. “The quicker we put no-fault evictions on the scrapheap, the better”, said Polly Neate, Shelter’s chief executive. “This unfair practice has no place in our society and the government agrees – but its promises are just words on a page until they become law. The government needs to finish the job and get rid of section 21, because every minute wasted leaves renters at risk.” The idea of a “no-fault eviction” always carried an air of phoney moral neutrality. Perhaps the intention was to provide some crumbs of comfort, in knowing at least that you weren’t expected to shoulder any blame for being turfed out of your home at minimal statutory notice. It’s an issue that has cut across demographics and regions. A form of legally built-in precarity that has hit north and south, young and old alike. The young family in Bedfordshire who had to scrabble for a new place, only to find themselves paying £350 more a month and with their savings obliterated. The woman and her and daughter in Manchester, turfed out after 15 years for daring to request repairs to their home. Many have spoken of a perpetual stress that amounts to physical illness. Though doubtlessly a positive step, scrapping section 21 doesn’t do much to address the problem of spiralling rents. After all, much has recently been written about the cost-of-living crisis, a catastrophe of steeply rising prices seemingly spread across every essential need of daily life, where food, fuel and shelter are increasingly sources of anxiety for millions. Over the past year, private rents have risen at record rates across the UK, with demand greatly outstripping supply (on some property websites, prospective tenants now outnumber available properties by three to one). By 2024, the number of people living with homelessness is expected to climb by a third. An approaching “tidal wave” of need and misery, as local authorities and charities have warned. About 66,000 people are expected to be forced into the hidden precarity of sofa-surfing, or into desperately unsuitable temporary accommodation. Others will be out on the streets, trying to fend for themselves as best they can. More than 1,200 people in the UK died while homeless in 2021 – a 32% rise in the course of a year. The landlord trade press has, predictably enough, not reacted kindly to the proposed changes. In an open letter to Shelter, the chief executive of the National Residential Landlords Association accused the charity of presenting “a disappointingly one-sided picture” and “sensationalising” the issue. Some have even thundered about the great unfairness visited on the overwhelming majority of hard-working, benevolent landlords who will now find it tougher to eject problem tenants. One buy-to-let landlord (with seven properties spread across Norfolk) explained to the Telegraph that she’d been so spooked by the abolition of section 21 that she felt she had no choice other than to evict one long-term tenant of six years, who had never missed a rent payment. After refurbishing the house, she’d raised the rent by £130 a month, while the ex-tenant was forced into sofa-surfing. The UK’s absurdly overheated “housing market” has long needed urgent reform. Decades of under-regulation and structural neglect have led to a terribly unbalanced present, where rising homelessness and chronic anxiety have somehow become entrenched facts of daily life. This wasn’t an inevitability, and change is always possible. The abolition of section 21 will be a welcome step, whenever it finally occurs. But there is much more to be done.

5/16/2022,"‘Sometimes the truth is messy and illogical,” says Anupama Chandrasekhar. “But theatre can display the truth in ways journalism or other nonfiction cannot. It’s not just the facts that people can struggle to understand – it is the enormity of things.” The playwright, who is based in Chennai, India, has spent the last 15 years examining just such uncomfortable truths, from 2007’s Free Outgoing, exploring the viral consequences of a sex tape, to 2019’s When the Crows Visit, which was partly inspired by the Delhi bus gang-rape of 2012. Her latest offering, The Father and the Assassin, tackles one of the formative moments in India’s history: the murder of Mahatma Gandhi. In true Chandrasekhar fashion, rather than focusing on the revered persona of Gandhi, she concentrates on his assassin, Hindu nationalist Nathuram Godse, seeking to get to the heart of his journey from avid follower of Gandhi’s doctrine of non-violence to killer. Although the assassination took place in 1948, Chandrasekhar decided to write about the era because its themes still felt startlingly relevant. “My job is to chronicle the changes that are happening in society,” she says, during a break from rehearsals at London’s National Theatre. “Over the last few years, Godse has entered political conversations in India.” In fact, Hindu nationalism has surged in the country, with statues and memorials erected to the assassin. “The divisiveness is so stark – there is no middle ground. I wanted to understand where this animosity against pluralism was coming from. Sometimes to understand the present, you have to go to the past.” Chandrasekhar paints a complex picture of Godse in the play, from his childhood raised as a girl in Pune by superstitious parents who feared another infant death, to his adulthood witnessing the brutal consequences of British rule as a journalist. Godse, played by Shubham Saraf, is on stage throughout the play – we witness this world through his eyes. Indhu Rubasingham, artistic director at London’s Kiln theatre, will direct the play, the fourth time the pair have worked together since first collaborating on Free Outgoing. “Anu talks about the unthinkable,” Rubasingham says, sitting beside the playwright. “She gets at the tension between personal individualism and the pressures of society – to the things we don’t want to speak about.” It feels pointed that this confrontation between the personal and political is taking place at the National – addressing the consequences of Partition in front of an audience likely made up of many of the British empire’s immigrant subjects. “It’s a fantastic opportunity, but also an opportunity to fuck up,” Rubasingham laughs. For Chandrasekhar, putting this play on in Britain also exposes the often-hidden aspects of the country’s history. “I didn’t realise there was a gap in the British education system about the empire until I came here,” she says. “I hope this work will speak to those audience members who have south Asian history, as well as enlighten others about the legacies of colonialism.” Just as Godse has been revived as a figurehead of Hindu nationalism, so recent years have seen a revisionism of Gandhi’s saintly status as the “father” of India. Questions have been raised around his practices of celibacy in later life, as well as his views on Black South Africans while living in the apartheid state. “I’m trying to sift through the mythology surrounding these figures to understand what goes into the brutal, dirty world of pre-independence India,” Chandrasekhar says. “I didn’t want any of the characters to be idols, since enough hagiographies have already been written. It’s 75 years since Indian independence and we should begin to treat these political figures like the human beings with flaws that they were.” Chandrasekhar mentions Richard Attenborough’s Oscar-winning 1982 film Gandhi as one touchstone to avoid. “My impetus was to move away from Attenborough and his style,” she says. “We’ve had enough of Gandhi’s story, but there’s so little known about Godse. I took what facts we have and fluffed them up with my own fictions to create this character. I let him go where he wanted to take me, since it was the journey leading to the assassination I needed to follow.” Rubasingham adds: “Anu creates this world on the cusp of change. The subject matter is so huge, you could write hundreds of plays on its themes. No one play can answer everything – this is Anu’s version of a particular moment.” Since Chandrasekhar has previously faced calls to moderate her controversial work, does she feel there is a risk in taking a nuanced view of a moment so symbolic to Indian national consciousness? “What I take from Gandhi is that bravery is something that can be practised,” she says. “I’m not the most courageous writer but I’m learning to be brave.” Ultimately, she sees the purpose of her work as fostering the empathic connections that were lacking in pre-independence India – and still are today. “I want the audience to learn to listen to each other,” she says. “To understand there is perhaps a kernel of truth in what the other person is saying. Without listening, we can descend into violence.” The Father and the Assassin is at the Olivier theatre, London, until 18 June.",Arts/Stage,"The celebrated assassin: the play about Gandhi’s killer, still dividing India",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/16/celebrated-assassin-play-gandhis-killer-india-anupama-chandrasekhar-nathuram-godse
5/16/2022,"As Buffalo, New York, mourns the victims of a mass shooting at a supermarket Saturday that left 10 dead and three wounded, details are emerging about the shooter’s movements before the attack and how the devastating racist attack unfolded. The 18-year-old shooter, who is a self-confessed white supremacist, shot 11 Black and two white victims in a “racially motivated hate crime” authorities said. It plunged the mostly Black Buffalo East Side neighborhood into grief and shock. But the plotting of the attack happened many miles away, had likely been in development for months and even apparently involved a reconnaissance of the targeted area. The shooter is believed to have traveled about 200 miles (320km ) from his home of Conklin, New York, to Buffalo but signs of trouble had surrounded him for some time. One year ago, he was the subject of a law enforcement investigation, according to The Buffalo News. High school authorities in Broome county, New York called the police in June 2021, claiming that he had “threatened violence in comments made to fellow students”. “A school official reported that this very troubled young man had made statements indicating that he wanted to do a shooting, either at a graduation ceremony, or sometime after,” the newspaper reported, citing a government source. The state police were dispatched to investigate and he was referred for counseling and a mental health assessment. Officials have said that the shooter purchased his gun legally in New York. He did not purchase the high-capacity magazine in this state, they said. The purported shooter recently purchased a Bushmaster XM-15, an assault weapon in the style of an AR-15, from Vintage Firearms, a gun shop in Endicott, New York, the New York Times reported. Robert Donald, the store’s owner, told The Times that he conducted a background check on the alleged shooter, and that nothing turned up. “He didn’t stand out – because if he did, I would’ve never sold him the gun,” he told the newspaper. A lengthy racist manifesto surfaced online after the shooting, and the writer’s name matches that of the alleged shooter. The text indicated that the writer planned his steps “down to the minute”, including diagrams inside the Tops Friendly Market. This manifesto, the validity of which has not been confirmed by authorities, said that the supermarket was selected because the postal code had the highest percentage of Black people close to where he lived, WIVB reported. The author stated that he had considered such an attack for several years, but started planning in earnest this January. Meanwhile, police say that the shooter “was in the Buffalo area at least the day before”. “It seems that he had come here to scope out the area, to do a little reconnaissance work on the area before he carried out his just evil, sickening act,” Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia said on This Week With George Stephanopoulos. Buffalo’s mayor, Byron Brown, further described the gunman’s alleged reconnaissance in an interview with CNN. “It sounds like he was here for maybe several days from reports that I’ve been hearing and that he did surveil this community, was scouting the supermarket, actually talked to some people in the area,” Brown said. The shooter arrived at Tops around 2.30pm, authorities said. He wore military garb and body armor, as well as a “tactical helmet”, according to ABC News. His rampage began in the store’s parking lot. Video shows him arriving at the store with a gun on the front seat. He then trained his gun on people in the parking lot, as he exited his vehicle, and started shooting. “He had a camera that he was livestreaming what he was doing,” police commissioner Gramaglia, told reporters. He shot four people outside the store, local prosecutors said. Three died. The gunman then entered the grocery. Aaron Salter, a recently retired Buffalo police department lieutenant, shot at the gunman in an attempt to stop him. While Salter was able to hit the shooter, he was protected by his tactical gear, authorities said. The shooter killed Salter. The gunman then shot eight more people inside of the grocery. Six died, and two were injured, prosecutors said. Four victims worked at the store, authorities said. Buffalo police arrived at the store and confronted the shooter inside the vestibule. “At that point the suspect put the gun to his own neck. Buffalo police personnel – two patrol officers – talked the suspect into dropping the gun. He dropped the gun, took off some of his tactical gear, surrendered at that point. And he was led outside, put in a police car,” Gramaglia said. The shooter appeared in court hours later, where he wore a white hospital gown. He was arraigned on one first-degree murder count, and was held without bail. He pleaded not guilty. Meanwhile, scores of law enforcement agents arrived at the shooter’s parents home, where he lived, hours after the shooting, according to WIVB. The shooter’s parents were cooperating with authorities.

5/16/2022,"If the US supreme court follows through with its initial decision to overturn Roe v Wade next month, 26 states are certain or likely to ban abortion. For those who want to protect abortion rights, a governor’s veto pen is about to become all the more powerful. The probable end of Roe has raised the stakes in gubernatorial races across the country, particularly in states with Republican-led legislatures that would probably move to ban abortion unless a Democratic governor steps in. Democratic gubernatorial candidates are now stressing the urgency of the moment to voters, portraying themselves as the last line of defense against an abortion ban in their states. Four states with Republican-controlled legislatures and Democratic governors – Kansas, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – are holding gubernatorial races in November. Democrats are also paying close attention to gubernatorial elections in battleground states where Republicans currently control both the governor’s mansion and the state legislature, such as Georgia and Arizona. If the supreme court overturns Roe and Republicans have full control of the state government, abortion bans in those states will become all but certain. Some of the toss-up states holding gubernatorial races this year – including Michigan, Wisconsin and Arizona – already have abortion bans on the books that predate Roe, and Republicans have called for their enforcement if the court reverses the landmark case. In Kansas and Pennsylvania, the sitting Democratic governors have both previously vetoed bills restricting abortion access, and those proposals would probably be enacted if a Republican took control. “The leaked draft opinion overturning Roe v Wade makes one thing clear – the future of reproductive rights will be defined at the state level,” said Christina Amestoy, senior communications advisor for the Democratic Governors Association. “Who sits in the governor’s office will determine a woman’s ability to access abortion.” Since the court’s draft opinion was made public, Republican gubernatorial candidates’ views on abortion have come under renewed scrutiny. In Pennsylvania, all four leading Republican gubernatorial candidates have indicated they would support some form of an abortion ban. State senator Doug Mastriano, who now leads in polls ahead of the Tuesday primary, said at a recent debate that he would oppose any exceptions to an abortion ban, such as for rape, incest or the safety of the mother. Josh Shapiro, the presumptive Democratic gubernatorial nominee in Pennsylvania, has already cut an attack ad warning that Mastriano “wants to ban abortion” if elected. “Every one of our opponents has made it clear: they would sign a bill banning abortion and taking away a woman’s right to choose,” said Shapiro’s spokesperson, Manuel Bonder. “With DC failing to protect these rights, Josh Shapiro will stand up and fight to ensure Pennsylvania remains a place where everyone has the freedom to start a family how and when they want to.” A bill to restrict a woman's right to choose will land on the desk of our next Governor, and if one of my GOP opponents wins, they'll sign it into law.I'll veto it.I am the only candidate for Governor who would make that choice. That's a fact. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat running for governor in Arizona, has similarly promised that she will use her veto pen to block abortion restrictions, while also calling for a repeal of the state’s 1901 law that criminalizes administering the procedure. “I will do everything in my power to protect Arizonans’ fundamental freedoms and access to reproductive healthcare, and use my veto power to strike down anti-abortion measures that come across my desk,” Hobbs said after the draft opinion leaked. And Democratic gubernatorial candidates are not simply waiting until election day to take action for the potential end of Roe. Stacey Abrams, the voting rights leader running for governor of Georgia, temporarily paused fundraising for her campaign earlier this month to instead raise money for abortion rights groups. In Michigan, the Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, has filed a lawsuit to block implementation of a 1931 abortion ban that does not allow for exceptions related to rape or incest. Whitmer has also asked the Michigan supreme court to recognize the right to abortion access under the state’s constitution. In her New York Times op-ed published last week, Whitmer warned that it would be nearly impossible to repeal the 1931 ban with Republicans controlling the Michigan legislature, and she underscored the need for Democrats to use every tool at their disposal to protect abortion rights. “We can all sense the hopelessness and despair that tens of millions of American women – our neighbors, family members and friends – are feeling,” Whitmer said. “But despair is a choice, and pessimism is a luxury. We must take unprecedented steps to protect the right to choose.” The likely end of Roe has also started to affect some gubernatorial primaries, as candidates use their views on abortion to distinguish themselves from their opponents. David Perdue, the Trump-backed gubernatorial candidate in Georgia, has called on the sitting Republican governor, Brian Kemp, to call the state legislature back for an emergency session to pass an abortion ban if Roe is overturned. “Georgia voters deserve to know where their governor stands on this issue,” Perdue said after the draft opinion leaked. “You are either going to fight for the sanctity of life or you’re not.” But for the most part, Republicans have tried to downplay how much the end of Roe would affect the midterm elections. “Reminder for those wondering about the politics of the leaked Scotus opinion, Terry McAuliffe spent all fall trying to make abortion THE central issue in the Virginia gov race,” Jesse Hunt, communications director for the Republican Governors Association, said earlier this month. “He lost by 2% in a state Biden won by 10%.” Reminder for those wondering about the politics of the leaked SCOTUS opinion: Terry McAuliffe spent all fall trying to make abortion THE central issue in the VA Gov race…He lost by 2% in a state Biden won by 10% https://t.co/vNEftItbYW Polls show that the probable end of Roe has certainly caught voters’ attention, although many Americans remain more focused on economic issues like record-high inflation. A survey released by Monmouth University last week showed 26% of Americans named economic policy as their most significant concern for the midterm elections, making it the most common response. But abortion was cited almost as often, with 25% of Americans selecting it as their top priority when appraising candidates. Amestoy argued Democratic gubernatorial candidates do not have to choose between campaigning on their plan to combat inflation and their promise to protect abortion rights. Instead, she encouraged candidates to use their opponents’ views on abortion to paint Republicans as out of touch with the needs of average Americans. “Republicans are campaigning on extreme, fringe agendas, like banning abortion, rather than on delivering for families,” Amestoy said. “It’s a stark contrast Democratic governors and candidates can draw while they work to address the concerns voters care most about.” Drawing that contrast is even more important for Democratic gubernatorial candidates with federal abortion legislation stalled in Congress. Last Wednesday, Senate Republicans and Democrat Joe Manchin again blocked a bill that would have codified Roe and secured abortion rights at the national level. If the supreme court does indeed overturn Roe next month without other federal protections in place, individual states’ policies will soon dictate if and how Americans can access abortion. “The reproductive freedoms of millions of Americans are on the line,” Amestoy said. “Electing Democratic governors is our best and perhaps only hope of protecting them.”",News/US news,Abortion rights: how a governor’s veto can protect women’s freedoms,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/16/roe-v-wade-abortion-rights-governor-veto-elections
5/16/2022,"Argentinian artist Ad Minoliti’s work draws on the legacy of geometric abstraction – art made using forms and shapes, often with bold colours – as “a tool to question patriarchal structures”. Among their influences, Minoliti, who is non-binary and uses they/them pronouns, cites two rival groups of artists in Argentina, the Grupo Madí and Asociación Arte Concreto-Invención (AACI). The work of both groups focuses on geometric abstraction, specifically a movement known as concrete art. First defined by the Dutch artist Theo van Doesburg in 1930, it embraces the use of lines, colours and planes, among other forms, to create art free from any basis in reality. Both Grupo Madí and AACI were born out of a revolutionary period for Argentinian art during the latter half of the 1940s, amid a backdrop of political instability under the military dictatorship of General Juan Perón. Through their work, they made political statements, evoking themes of social justice and liberation. Despite being inspired by how these two groups used “art as a way to make a better life”, Minoliti was frustrated by the male dominance of art in general. So, they turned to queer and feminist theory to influence their work. “I apply the theory to geometric abstraction so as to rethink, or try to break the binary, of human classification,” says Minoliti, who represented Argentina at the 2019 Venice Biennale. “Of course, abstraction and geometry shouldn’t have a gender, but I think art history is very male-dominated. And you can tell, it’s very strong … Modernity is rooted in a patriarchal repression of the feminine.” In contrast, Minoliti uses what they call “non-binary geometry”, which includes “all these values that modernism dismissed: the humour, the tenderness, but without being cynical”. Minoliti’s first solo show in the UK, Biosfera Peluche/Biosphere Plush, debuted at the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art in Gateshead and now moves to Tate St Ives, Cornwall. In keeping with the peluche of the title (which means “teddy bear” in Spanish), Minoliti’s approach is playful. Bright murals adorn the walls, and standing around the room are human-like figures of no apparent gender that Minoliti calls “furries”, their heads inspired by animal toys. The exhibition is a critical exploration of the Biosphere 2 experiment of the early 90s, in which a group of eight men and women lived in isolation in the world’s largest closed ecological system: a three-acre complex of sealed geodesic domes and pyramids in the Arizona desert. With its forests, deserts and farm, the facility was originally designed to show how humans could survive in an artificial environment in outer space. But it didn’t work: as oxygen levels dropped, participants were left struggling to breathe; animals died; crops failed. For Minoliti, the story of Biosphere 2 highlights the capitalist and colonialist connotations of space exploration – all eight participants were white. Biosfera Peluche/Biosphere Plush, then, is Minoliti’s own biosphere, which, they say, “transforms this experiment into the opposite”: a universe that is “democratic, open and a safe space”. It also features the artist’s Feminist School of Painting, first exhibited at the Kadist gallery, San Francisco, in 2018, an active classroom that will be used to host painting workshops and discussions. The exhibition, Minoliti says, was conceived during the pandemic, in response to the rise of eco-fascism – a combination of authoritarian and environmentalist politics, often relating to immigration – both on social media and in the physical world. “Eco-fascism is also driven by white supremacy,” they explain. “So I wanted to make a statement against this idea of an apocalyptic future. Why can’t we think about other types of ending?” Ad Minoliti: Biosfera Peluche/Biosphere Plush is at Tate St Ives from 28 May to 30 October. “The works hanging on this tree are inspired by the character Sarah Kay [a series of cutesy drawings by Australian illustrator Vivien Kubbos]. I read that the media had been using Kay as propaganda for conservative women, [encouraging them] to go back to caretaking and not take to the streets. I wanted to redraw that gender role.” “The Feminist School of Painting [at the far end of the photo] is a big project in this idea of rethinking the white cube and the gallery and the traditional painting into something that is interactive and open to all backgrounds and ages. The Feminist School and the Biosphere Plush are set on cooperation.” “The palette of the murals – orange, green and violet – comes from activist movements here [in Argentina],” says Minoliti. “The green is referring to the feminist movement for legal abortion. The violet is also a colour that represents the Latin American feminist movement. The orange represents the protests against the church being in politics and the government.”",Arts/Art and design,The Argentine artist breaking barriers with ‘non-binary geometry’ – and furries,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/16/ad-minoliti-non-binary-geometry-and-furries
5/16/2022,"At the start of another sporting weekend dominated by football Maro Itoje gave an interview which sounded like a cri de coeur. Rugby, the England flanker warned, needed to do more to grow its game, to market itself better against more media‑savvy sports and to engage with those outside its “stereotypical” world. “Rugby is very good at speaking to its own market, at preaching to the choir,” he told the Mirror. “There’s an awful lot of room for improvement. There’s no way you can tell me Formula One is more exciting than rugby. Yet it’s definitely packaged better.” But rugby is far from the only sport caught between a hardcore fanbase and potential new audiences, the comfortable and the uncertain, unsure whether to stick or twist. Athletics and racing are, too. Meanwhile they and others cast envious eyes at F1, which has catapulted itself into the lucrative US market and elsewhere in the blink of an eye. I thought of Itoje’s words on Saturday while part of a raucous crowd watching the Night of the 10,000m PBs on Hampstead Heath, a very unusual day of athletics culminating in women’s and men’s races which doubled as qualifiers for the World Athletics Championships in July. When the organiser, Ben Pochee, came up with the idea nine years ago, barely 100 people came to watch. But there were more like 5,000 there on Saturday night, nursing beers and eating burgers, and – unlike at other meetings – allowed in the infield and on lane eight of the track. One British athlete, Melissa Courtney-Bryant, described the atmosphere as “insane”, adding: “I’ve never raced in anything like it.” Another, Team GB’s Tokyo Olympics marathon star, Chris Thompson, equated it to being at the darts and admitted it was cool he was able to exchange the odd word with spectators. Meanwhile the Olympic pole vault bronze medallist Holly Bradshaw reckoned that, if the UK hosted more such meetings, we would get to see top GB athletes competing more often. Also watching on was track and field’s original hellraiser, Dave Bedford, still instantly recognisable by the Zapata moustache he sported when breaking the 10,000m world record nearly 50 years ago. “This could be the future of the sport,” he said. “What Ben Pochee has done is incredible, but you could do it with every event. Imagine watching some of the best 100m or 200m runners up close, or pole vaulters clearing the height of a double-decker bus from a few metres away?” There was something else that Bedford wanted to stress. Athletes themselves also have to be willing to show more of their unvarnished personalities, for better and for worse, and to engage with the media. “I liked the Guardian’s John Rodda and also trusted him not to turn me over,” he said. “So whenever he called me I always picked up the phone.” Bedford’s legendary attitude on and off the track made him so well known that, 50 years ago this summer, he made the Guardian’s front page when he famously shot at the race walker Paul Nihill with an air rifle in St Moritz while training for the Munich Olympics. Rodda wrote at the time: “Nihill said he was standing on the balcony watching Bedford practise when suddenly Bedford swung round and pointed the rifle in Nihill’s direction.” Nihill explained: “I instinctively moved back, heard the shot and had just got behind the glass which divides my balcony from the next one.” Rodda was also able to get the other side of the story. “Bedford regarded the incident lightly when I spoke to him,” he wrote, “and said he was not aiming at Nihill but at the balcony next door.” Of course we live in different times. No one is advocating athletes take literal potshots at each other. But there are certain fundamentals that remain timeless. Sport thrives on narrative, rivalries and personalities. It also needs to adapt with times and trends. Yet too often its gatekeepers are resistant to change, suspicious of outsiders and anyone who isn’t a pure cheerleader. I experienced this after tweeting that the club athlete Ellis Cross had outsprinted Mo Farah at the Vitality London 10,000 – before suggesting Farah’s career at elite level was surely finished. It made for a cracking story, with Britain’s most successful Olympian being beaten by someone known only by the most diehard of fans. However, some took a different view, including a British Olympian who responded on Twitter. “Sad journalism! Mo was magnanimous in defeat, as Ellis was in winning. Shame journalism can’t be more positive or progressive than this. Get to know the sport better!” What the respondent did not perhaps realise was that my tweet was purely factual. Cross had proudly described himself as a club runner after crossing the line, explaining he had even had to pay his £37 entry fee to compete, while Farah indicated his career as a track runner was probably over, too. Yet it still created a minor athletics culture war over what, exactly, constituted an elite athlete. The bigger picture, surely, was that it gave the sport a rare appearance on the back pages and on national TV, while giving the likeable Cross a deserved day in the sun. Yet a small minority appeared desperate to take offence on his behalf. Cross, incidentally, was racing on Saturday – although sadly he had to drop out due to stomach cramps. But he, too, had enjoyed the experience. “This is the best race in the calendar,” he told me. “There’s something special in the air.” The challenge for athletics, now, is to bottle this magic – and spread it.",Sport/Sport,Athletics must learn lessons from Formula One and get on track with new audience | Sean Ingle,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/may/16/athletics-must-learn-lessons-from-formula-one-and-get-on-track-with-new-audience
5/16/2022,"Iceland is under pressure to ban the production of a hormone extracted from pregnant horses, a practice that has been described as “cruel” and “animal abuse”.The hormone is used by farmers across the UK and Europe to increase reproduction in pigs, cows and other female farm animals. Pregnant Mare Serum Gonadotropin (PMSG) is extracted from pregnant horses in Iceland during the summer at “blood farms”, before being converted into powder and shipped around the world. Animal welfare campaigners in Iceland visiting farms with the Guardian showed broken restraint boxes and enclosures covered in bite marks, which they claimed was a sign of anxious horses. Undercover footage from farms, taken by animal welfare campaigners, also appeared to show distressed horses being hit and struggling in restraint boxes before blood was drawn using a large cannula inserted in their jugular vein. The European Commission said it was “seriously concerned” about the treatment of horses farmed for blood, while the European parliament has called for imports of the hormone to be banned. In late March, an international coalition of 17 NGOs submitted a complaint against Iceland to the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) Surveillance Authority (ESA), which monitors compliance with European Economic Area (EEA) rules in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The complaint accused Iceland of breaching EEA law on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes and said Icelandic authorities should ban blood collection. Support for a ban is also growing within Iceland. The opposition People’s party has put a bill through parliament calling for a ban. The bill, which is awaiting a vote, is supported by groups including the Icelandic Tourism Association. A working group, set up by Iceland’s Fisheries and Agriculture department is due to report its findings this summer. Experts have also expressed concern about the amount of blood taken from horses. The pharmaceutical company Isteka, which owns or subcontracts farms, said five litres of blood are taken from pregnant mares every week for eight consecutive weeks – around four times the amount specified on international guidelines. The Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority (Mast), which granted Isteka a licence, said: “There is no indication that blood collection of five litres a week for up to eight weeks has a negative impact on the health and welfare of the mares or their foals.” Ingunn Reynisdóttir, a veterinarian who lives in north Iceland and has worked with horses all her life, disagreed. “It’s too much [blood] and if you take too much they are trembling and have difficulty walking,” she said. Mette Uldahl, vice-president of the Federation of Veterinarians of Europe (FVE), said of the practice: “It’s animal abuse and it’s cruelty. You shouldn’t use untrained horses because they get too scared.” Iceland is home to about 80,000 Icelandic horses, 5,383 of which are used as “blood mares”. There are 119 blood farms operating in the country. Blood farms are believed to have been operating in Iceland for about 40 years, but Icelanders who spoke to the Guardian said they had little knowledge of them until last November, when the Animal Welfare Foundation undercover video was shown on television. A survey in December found most of the population was opposed to the blood farms. “I didn’t have a clue we were doing this here and I was shocked when I saw it,” said Bjarnheiður Hallsdóttir, chair of the Icelandic Travel Industry Association. “It [is] awful.” “I would like people to know that Iceland is actually stabbing semi-wild pregnant mares, taking their blood in extreme volumes and frequency, just to … make pigs have more pigs,” said Rósa Líf Darradóttir, a medical doctor and horse owner in Reykjavik. In Germany, 6.4m single doses of PMSG – the equivalent of about 32,000 litres of blood – were given to sows between 2016 and 2019, according to the federal ministry of food and agriculture. PMSG can be obtained legally in the UK from a registered vet, with products available including vaginal sponges for sheep, which induce early lambing, with advertised benefits such as producing lambs “at the optimum time for autumn sales”. A spokesperson said the EU commission believes dialogue with non-EU countries is crucial to “bringing positive change on animal welfare issues”. “The EU cannot impose its animal welfare standards in third countries and our trade policy has to respect the rules of the World Trade Organization. For this reason, the commission continues to address the importance of improving the welfare conditions of horses involved in the production of PMSG at multilateral level in the framework of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).” Sign up for the Animals Farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the biggest farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

5/16/2022,"The New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, says it will be “difficult” for first-home buyers to enter Sydney’s housing market using the federal government’s proposed superannuation access policy. While Perrottet, who has made addressing housing affordability a key priority for his government, said he welcomed the Coalition’s proposal to allow first-home buyers to access to up to $50,000 of their superannuation to buy a property, he acknowledged it would be of little help for many people. “For some it will help, for others it will not,” he said. Perrottet said he did not believe the government’s policy would drive up home prices. But with Sydney’s median home value above $1m, and the average superannuation balance for people being aged between 25 and 34 being about $41,000 for men and $31,000 for women, he agreed housing affordability would not be solved by allowing access to 40% of retirement savings. “Yeah, it’s going to be difficult,” he said. “And that’s why this proposal, whilst it’s welcome, can’t operate in isolation. I don’t believe one initiative is going to solve this problem.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Perrottet last week used a press conference with the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to welcome Labor’s proposed home-equity scheme – which the Coalition has sought to criticise – saying he was open to “new ways of thinking” on housing affordability. On Monday he gave the Coalition’s policy the same treatment, saying “we should at least give it a go and see what the take up is”. “Superannuation is incredibly important, but let’s not forget the scheme was set up at a time when we had a much higher rate of home ownership in this country,” he said. “The best way in which, particularly, young people grow their wealth is purchasing their first home. It makes a lot of sense I think, to do this in a measured way. We can’t have an Australia which can’t house its children.” But he also called on both parties to make housing “above politics”, calling for both state and federal governments to embrace “fair dinkum” tax reform to address the issue. “We need a suite of measures,” he said. “We can’t just tackle this with one-out policy – Albanese one out, Morrison one out, NSW government one out. We have to work together to get a better outcome.” Perrottet has long pushed for state stamp duty to be abolished in favour of an annual land tax, but the proposal has been slow-moving. On Monday he called stamp duty “the worst tax of all taxes”, but said NSW needed commonwealth help to reform it, given it contributes about $9bn to the state budget. “It is the biggest impediment not just to first-home buyers getting into the property market, but also transferring their property,” he said, but added that “it funds our teachers, our nurses, our police officers”. “States can’t embrace structural reform on their own. We need greater collaboration with the federal government.” The government’s proposed scheme would allow people to access up to $50,000 of superannuation savings, or 40% of the total balance, for the purchase of a first home. People would have to have saved a 5% deposit for the home already, and would have to return the invested amount as well as a share of capital gains back into their superannuation if the property was sold. The policy has been criticised in a number of quarters, including the superannuation scheme’s architect, former Labor prime minister Paul Keating, who said the policy showed the Liberal party did not believe in the scheme. “They object to working Australians having wealth in retirement independent of the government,” he said after the policy was announced.",News/Australia news,Dominic Perrottet downplays Coalition’s bid for first-home buyers to access superannuation,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/16/dominic-perrottet-downplays-coalitions-bid-for-first-home-buyers-to-access-superannuation
5/16/2022,"Halyna Vasylivna lives alone in a tiny “Khrushchevka” flat. At 94, she has outlived her sons and her husband, and her grandchildren live outside the city. Her apartment, named after the Soviet leader under whom the five-storey buildings in Kyiv’s Podil district were built, is too far from the bunker so she hides in her pantry during airstrikes. Vasylivna is grateful for her social worker Olya’s visits a few times a week. She wishes she did not live alone. “It’s important to have someone who can listen to you,” she says. Vasylivna is one of 2 million older women in Ukraine who have remained largely invisible to authorities. Most of Ukraine’s elderly people are women – they make up two-thirds of those aged over 65 and 71% of those aged above 75 – partly because Ukraine has the sixth highest proportion of women in the world. These women are reliant on tiny state pensions (Vasylivna’s is about £130 a month), and require support from social services, charities and international institutions. They have become the group most likely to be alone, whether through mobility issues, bereavement or a reluctance to leave familiar surroundings. The lucky few get help; many do not. Ukraine’s health and social care system was already under pressure before Russia invaded in February. Despite progress through reforms, including decentralisation that allowed regional institutions to allocate budgets locally, an overstretched and underfunded health system is again in crisis. Ukraine’s expenditure on healthcare has declined from 7.8% of GDP in 2015 to 7.1% in 2019 (the last available data). The world average was 9.8% in 2019. Now the country is experiencing a humanitarian crisis, with dozens of accounts of rape and murder of Ukrainian elderly women – the biggest group left behind, of those allowed to leave, and least able to escape. In Kyiv’s Holosiyevo district, there are 786 elderly people – 80% of them women like Vasylivna – alone, unable to leave their homes, and without relatives to care for them. Since Russia attacked, the number of social workers in the local centre has collapsed by more than 75%. Those women who remain are mostly elderly themselves, and now have four times as many clients to look after. They work five days a week, earning about £170 a month to supplement their small state pensions. “We need to support both our elderly clients and ourselves,” says 65-year-old social worker Nataliya Bodnar. Social centre manager, Oksana Ruban, says they have faced multiple challenges. “Public transport was closed, the curfew lasted sometimes up to several days, shops closed, too. We had to make sure all of our clients were taken care of by someone – if not relatives or us, at least by neighbours or volunteers. We all worked relentlessly.” The situation for older people is particularly acute in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions where a survey of more than 1,500 over-60s conducted in March revealed the scale of the problem: 99% do not want to leave their homes; 91% need help to get food; 91% are also experiencing extreme cold, with no heating due to electricity cuts; 75% need basic hygiene items; and 34% need urgent medication for chronic illness. These needs are exacerbated by a shortage of vital medicines and Russia destroying healthcare facilities. “I wonder why some young people evacuate their cats and hamsters, but leave their parents behind,” says Roman Vodyanyk, head doctor at Severodonetsk hospital in Luhansk, the only functioning hospital left in the city. With no water, gas or electricity in Severodonetsk, Vodyanyk has turned the hospital, which has more than 50 patients, into a humanitarian hub, providing hot food, wifi and medical support. About 220 patients have left in the past month, but many elderly people have no desire to evacuate, with nowhere to go and no one to care for them. “How do you evacuate a hospital in this situation? How do you leave them all behind?” asks Vodyanyk. So despite the shelling and along with local authorities, NGOs and volunteers, he is not leaving either. Elderly people are often the forgotten category in any humanitarian crisis – an analysis of Google news search keywords between 24 February and 22 April found that 97% of all Ukraine-headlined articles focused on children. Only 3% mentioned elderly people, of which only three touched on elderly women. Despite there being more than 50% more retirees in Ukraine than children under 15, the 390 UK NGOs operating in Ukraine are nearly twice as likely to be helping children than elderly people, According to Justin Derbyshire, CEO of HelpAge International, the problem is global: elderly patients’ specific needs are neglected by governments and international bodies during and after wars. “This is systemic ageism and an example of how bad the global system is at responding to older people’s needs.” Elderly people, such as Vasylivna and Bodnar, are at the centre of the crisis in Ukraine, as victims and rescuers. After a lifetime of looking after others, they are now vulnerable, not only to loneliness and hunger, but also to rape and murder. “I’ve seen everything – the Holodomor [great famine of 1932-33], the second world war, so many horrors. What else could scare me?” says Vasylivna. She never imagined Russia would invade. It is her inability to take care of herself that scares her now. She feels trapped. “I would evacuate if I could take care of myself. I was working my whole life. It’s such a shame I can’t do anything any more.” Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",News/Global development,Alone under siege: how older women are being left behind in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/may/16/alone-under-siege-how-older-women-are-being-left-behind-in-ukraine
5/16/2022,"Q I bought my first house last year for £240,000. However, my personal circumstances have changed and I have been thinking about looking for a new job. I work in a niche industry where vacancies don’t arise too often and I would probably have to relocate if I changed employer. Given the current talk of recession, I’m terrified that if I find a new job later this year or next year, my house value will have fallen. If I let it out, the rent would just cover the mortgage and the tax to pay would be quite hefty. Should I sell now and move into rented accommodation with the view to moving in the next year or so to avoid falling into negative equity?AN A Judging by the various expert predictions of what will happen to house prices over the rest of 2022, the chances of your falling into negative equity are slim. For you to be in negative equity, the value of your house would have to fall to below that of your outstanding mortgage. So if you took out a mortgage last year for 90% of its £240,000 purchase price, the value of your house would have to fall to £216,000 for negative equity to be a potential problem. Even the most pessimistic prediction of future house prices – from Halifax – does not predict falling house prices but suggests that at worst prices will not move or at best will rise by 2%. So I think it is safe for you to sit tight and wait until you have a firm job offer and know for certain where you will be moving to.",Lifestyle/Money,Should I sell my house now to avoid falling into negative equity?,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/may/16/sell-my-house-negative-equity-relocate
5/16/2022,"“I just feel like everyone tries to do something different but you all wind up doing the same damn thing.” When these words were uttered by Richard in Alex Garland’s novel The Beach – and in the film adaptation by a young Leonardo DiCaprio 22 years ago – no one realised just how prophetic they were. The novel’s protagonist was talking about the trap backpackers like him fall into when travelling around Thailand: all visiting the same sites, from Bangkok’s Khao San Road and the 46-metre reclining gold buddha at Wat Pho temple to full-moon parties on Ko Samui. He decides to do “something different”, and so begins a journey to find a secret island idyll. Little did the filmmakers realise they were about to add that location to the tourist bucket list and see its popularity explode. The film location for the fictional limestone-fringed paradise Richard discovers was an island called Phi Phi Leh. Until Hollywood came, few people knew about it, and even fewer visited. But after the film’s success, it became the island every daytripper wanted to visit, and they flocked in their millions – up to 6,000 tourists a day – from resorts such as Phuket, Krabi and Ko Phi Phi. “We just weren’t prepared for that many tourists,” said my guide Suree Pongnopparat Ka as we made our way by longtail boat towards the island from the Zeavola Resort, seven miles to the north on Ko Phi Phi. “The whole bay was consistently packed with speedboats, and you couldn’t even see the sand on the beach there were so many people.” In 2018, faced with mounting piles of rubbish, disappearing wildlife (on land and in the water) and dead coral (about 90% was estimated to be have been destroyed through misplaced boat anchors, unwitting swimmers and chemicals in their sunscreen), the Thai authorities decided to act. Despite opposition from local tour operators, (in 2018 the location was estimated to generate about 400 million baht – £9.5m – in revenue a year), the authorities closed the beach, initially for a period of four months. Working with conservationists and environmentalists, they extended this for a further year. And just when it was rumoured the bay would finally reopen, Covid hit, meaning it was closed to tourists for nearly four years in total. “The pandemic restrictions actually came at a good time for the bay,” said Siriwat Suebsai, a forestry technical officer who is overseeing the reopening of the beach. We met on the island’s new floating dock on Loh Sama Bay – on the opposite side of the island to the famous Maya Bay beach. “It allowed time for further recovery: having no one here made a big difference.” Less than six months after the beach closed, black-tipped reef sharks, which had formerly used the sheltered cove as a nursery ground, began to return in modest numbers; now, after several years of no disturbance, they are back in their hundreds. Conservationists had time and space to repair and plant nearly 30,000 fragments of coral, which has already bloomed and is attracting a myriad reef of fish; and a rare Puu Kai crab (not spotted for more than 10 years) has even paid the bay a visit. Human visitors, however, don’t have quite the same freedom of movement as before. The first change is the pier – not only is it well away from Maya Bay, but only eight boats at a time can dock, and they can stay no more than an hour. Booking a one-hour time slot on an app or via a tour operator (it’s open 10am-4pm) is also now essential. No more than 375 people can visit at one time, which is still a lot, but the authorities say it is sustainable. Leaving the boat, we walked on newly constructed boardwalks between two towering rocks, past a visitor information booth and into thick jungle. “We built the boardwalk to keep people off the vegetation, which had been badly destroyed,” said Siriwat. Before, there would have been no buildup to spying the mythical sands of Maya Bay, just an ungracious rev up to the sand in a speedboat. Thanks to this new pathway, I felt as if I’d walked into the pages of the book, following in Richard’s footsteps. The anticipation was palpable, and though other people were walking there too, it wasn’t the throngs I’d seen in pre-2018 photographs. Eventually I emerged through fringing palm trees into a clearing and … a huge sign with a list of rules to follow: no littering, no drones, no boats and – crucially – no swimming. One woman, though, was desperate to post a photo of herself in the water on social media. But with a shrill whistle Siriwat’s team leapt into action and, shamefaced, the woman left the water and sulked back to the sand. I asked Siriwat how tourists had taken to the new rules. “In the old days we focused on increasing tourism so much that we forgot what was important,” he said. “We have to protect these areas. Now that we’ve learned that lesson and made changes, it’s important we keep going on the same track no matter what. We’ve gone back to basics and put nature first. And if nature is good, the tourists will come anyway.” I looked out to the beach – at its sand as soft and white as flour, its fortress of limestone towers covered with vegetation so green it looked like it had already been put through an Instagram filter – and couldn’t help but agree. I walked further, leaving my guides behind – and within five minutes had left all the other tourists, too. Even on this the most-visited beach in Thailand, it seemed I could, for about 40 minutes at least, enjoy my own little slice of paradise. At the end of the film, Richard reflects: “Of course, you can never forget what you’ve done. But we adapt. We carry on.” Let’s hope that here in Maya Bay, with these lessons learned and new initiatives in place, his words once again prove prescient.

5/16/2022,"Kash Patel, a former Republican aide on the House intelligence committee who Donald Trump weighed installing as deputy CIA director, is publishing a children’s book on Monday that perpetuates the false claim the Steele dossier sparked investigations into Russian collusion. The book features characters such as “King Donald” and his enemy “Hillary Queenton”. In the book, titled “The Plot Against the King” and set to be published by Brave Books, Patel repeats Trump’s false claim that the FBI began investigating links between his campaign and Russia based on a dossier compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British spy. The 35-page tome, complete with an epilogue that details Donald Trump’s false claims about the FBI inquiry, bizarrely uses the tool of children’s fictional characters to provide a revisionist account of the probe that dogged the first two years of the Trump presidency and eventually led to a special counsel investigation. Over the course of the book, the narrative lionises Patel and depicts him as a wizard who supposedly shows how “the King” Trump was wrongly accused of “cheating” to take the throne. The book claims the king was accused of cheating by a “shifty knight” – a reference to the Democratic chair of the intelligence committee, Adam Schiff, who claims to have a “paper” from a “steel” box attesting to wrongdoing. But Patel writes that he then found evidence that the slug “Keeper Komey” – a reference to former FBI director James Comey – put slugs in the “steel” box at the behest of “Hillary Queenton”, who was also vying for the throne – a reference to Clinton. The wizard Patel then proclaims to the kingdom, the book says, that “the king, King Donald, is innocent” and “did not work with the Russonians” – a reference to Russia – and “Hillary wrote that paper and had her sneaky slugs slide into the steel box”. In reality the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign after a foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, told an Australian diplomat that Russia had political “dirt” on Hillary Clinton ahead of the 2016 presidential election. The information in the Steele Dossier did not reach FBI officials involved in the investigation until almost a year after the 2016 election, and even the then-Republican House intelligence committee for which Patel worked found no evidence for Trump’s claim. But the illustrated children’s book authored by Patel, a pre-publication copy of which the Guardian received unsolicited, makes no mention of that conclusion, or an additional memo stating conclusively that the FBI investigation did not originate with the Steele Dossier. Patel enjoyed a rapid rise from an obscure staffer on the Republican staff of the House intelligence committee after he endorsed Trump’s false claims that the FBI wiretapped Trump’s phones and was eventually promoted to chief of staff at the Department of Defense.",News/US news,Former Trump official Kash Patel writes children’s book repeating false claim over Steele dossier,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/16/former-trump-official-kash-patel-writes-childrens-book-repeating-false-claim-over-steele-dossier
5/16/2022,"The expansion of an iron ore mine in the Arctic that would have increased shipping and led to the “complete extirpation of narwhal” from the region has been blocked. After four years of consultations and deliberations, the Nunavut Impact Review Board rejected a request from Baffinland Iron Mines Corp asking to significantly increase mining on the northern tip of Baffin Island in Nunavut, Canada. The area is home to one of the world’s richest iron ore deposits, and the densest narwhal population in the world. The news came as a surprise and a relief to conservationists and community members working to protect the narwhal population and the Inuit who rely on them for subsistence. “I actually cried,” said Chris Debicki, a vice-president and counsel at the conservation organisation Oceans North. “The case against expansion at this moment was too strong and community opposition was too loud.” The review board issued a statement on Friday saying that the Mary River mine expansion project carried potential for “significant and lasting negative effects on marine mammals, the marine environment, fish, caribou and other terrestrial wildlife, vegetation and freshwater”. “In the Board’s view, these negative effects could also impact Inuit harvesting, culture, land use and food security,” it said. Dan Vandal, Canada’s northern affairs minister, can now decide whether to side with the review board or with Baffinland. He is expected to make his decision within the next three months. Baffinland’s CEO, Brian Penney, said in a brief online statement that the company was “surprised and disappointed” in the review board’s report and recommendations, and that he urged “the federal government to consider all of the evidence and input and to approve the Phase 2 application with fair and reasonable conditions”. Baffinland is jointly owned by ArcelorMittal and the Houston private equity firm the Energy and Minerals Group. Its expansion bid sought to increase shipping from the current 6m tonnes of iron ore a year to 12m from its north Baffin Island port at Milne Inlet. It also wanted to build a second railway to another port, from which it intended to ship an additional 18m tonnes. Current shipping volumes have already had a “devastating” impact on the narwhal population, said Enookie Inuarak, vice-chairperson of the Mittimatalik Hunters and Trappers Organization. Narwhals are a type of whale recognisable by the long, spear-like tusk that protrudes from its head. The animal is an important predator in Eclipse Sound and other Arctic waters, as well a major food source for Inuit in the region. Inuarak said generations of hunters have relied on narwhal hunting in the summer, when thousands of narwhal typically come to Eclipse Sound. Because narwhal meat is rich in vitamin C, it helps keep community members healthy during the round-the-clock darkness of winter. Last summer, hunters found barely any narwhals. “We rely on narwhals for diet, for health and also economically,” Inuarak said, adding that their growing absence from the region “means less of everything”. Since Baffinland began mining operations at Mary River in 2015, the number of narwhal has precipitously declined, according to Arctic marine biologist Kristin Westdal. “If you look at the surveys [since 2014], you see this incredible, statistically significant decline in the narwhal population in this area – we see 12,000, 10,000, 5,000, 2,000,” Westdal said. Because narwhals use underwater echolocation to communicate with each other, the noise and interference from mining transport ships is forcing them out of the area. Inuarak said Friday’s ruling would lead to celebrations in Pond Inlet, a community near the mine, including a small parade, but he said the threat remains. The final decision on the future of the mine’s operations rests with the federal government. Many supporters wanted the expansion because it came with promises of royalties and jobs. But Debicki said the review board’s rejection was significant. “This iron ore deposit is one of the best in the world because of its high concentration,” he said. “The reality is that there’ll be mining in this region not for tens of years, but likely for hundreds of years, so it’s super important to get the development right at the outset.”",News/World news,Rejection of Arctic mine expansion bid offers hope for narwhal population,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/16/arctic-mine-expansion-rejection-narwhal-canada
5/16/2022,"I am 80 years old and recently lost my wife of 54 years. I wanted to replace our bed and in March I ordered a small 4ft double from HSL in Bristol. The salesperson was helpful and assured me the bed would fit up the stairwell of my 1932 semi-detached house. However, when it arrived the delivery men said there was no way they could get the frame and mattress up the stairs, so they had to take it away. This left me feeling distressed and confused. After discussion with my family I cancelled the order but discovered that under the terms of the contract I would be fined 30% of the £2,485 cost, which is £745.50. My family think this is excessive and it should be reduced to cover the company’s costs as the bed and mattress are brand new and can be resold.DT, Bristol You acknowledge that HSL’s cancellation policy was outlined in the sales contract you signed and the company also sets it out clearly on its website. However, you feel you were given bad advice in the store and the penalty you face should be reduced to reflect that. When we contacted HSL on your behalf, the company said: “Our terms and conditions clearly state that it is the customer’s responsibility to ensure that the appropriate access is available to ensure successful delivery.” However, it added that while unable to confirm that the salesperson had provided you with the reassurance you claim, customer satisfaction was its “number one priority”. It has agreed to reduce the cancellation charge to 10% (£248.50) and has reimbursed you £497. You think this is fair and have bought an alternative, cheaper bed from John Lewis, which you are very happy with. We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

5/16/2022,"The latest wireless earbuds from Sennheiser are smaller, longer lasting and have better sound and noise cancelling than their predecessors, making them some of the best on the market. Priced at £219.99 ($249.95/A$399.5), the third-generation Momentum true wireless earbuds look set to dethrone Sony’s WF-1000XM4 as the best-sounding earbuds you can buy. Succeeding the excellent 2020 model and adopting a similar design to the firm’s cheaper CX series of earbuds, they are 16% smaller and so fit better in my ears, making them more comfortable to wear for longer periods. And their squarer, smoother form is far less distinctive than their predecessor’s Rolo-like form. They feel light, really well made, and have IPX4 sweat resistance, which means they should be fine in the rain or workouts. Just don’t submerge them in liquid. The Sennheiser logo on the earbuds is a touchpad for a full set of customisable controls including volume and noise-cancelling modes, which work very well. Few competitors have as many options here. The battery lasts for about 6.5 hours of music with noise cancelling turned on, which is a hour or so short of Sony’s best but still very good. The case can fully charge the earbuds three times, and is topped up via USB-C or Qi wireless charging. It takes 90 minutes to fully charge the earbuds, but a 10-minute charge in the case is enough to add one hour of playback. Water resistance: IPX4 (splash) Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.2, SBC, AAC, aptX adaptive Battery life: 7 hours, up to 28 hours with case Earbud weight: 6g each Driver size: 7mm Charging case weight: 66g Case charging: USB-C, Qi wireless charging The best bit about the earbuds is how good they sound, producing rich, detailed audio with excellent separation of instruments. They are reasonably bassy, but low notes are punchy and well controlled. There is a bass boost function too, but I don’t think many will need it. Mid tones and high notes are detailed and well balanced, vocals are clear, and most music genres sound great. They lack a bit of energy in some electronica tracks but do a better job with jazz and classical than most competitors. There is a full equaliser and an option to create a custom setting through a short listening test. Sennheiser has promised to add a full sound personalisation setting that will go beyond simple equaliser adjustments in a future update. The earbuds have very effective active noise cancelling , which is capable of reducing most rumbles, fan noise and road noise by adjusting the level of noise suppression automatically to the environment. Its wind noise reduction setting is the best I have tried and the ambient awareness mode is good too. But they struggle a bit with speech and higher tones, such as the taps of fingers on a keyboard, and can’t quite match the performance of Sony’s class-leading WF-1000XM4. The earbuds support standard Bluetooth 5.2 with the universal SBC and AAC audio formats. But they also support the very latest aptX Adaptive audio format, which when used with a compatible device offers better audio quality and lower latency, which is particularly good for gaming. Only a handful of newer Android smartphones support aptX Adaptive at the moment, however. The earbuds can be used independently of each other, which is handy for calls. My voice sounded a bit robotic on the phone but was clear even when speaking in loud environments, effectively suppressing background noise. The Bluetooth connection to a range of phones, tablets and computers was rock solid, but they only connect to one device at a time at the moment. An update to support connection to two devices simultaneously (multi-point), such as a laptop and a phone, is promised at a later date. Sennheiser estimates the batteries in the earbuds and case will maintain at least 80% of their original capacity after four years of daily use, listening for two hours a day, but the batteries are not replaceable, ultimately making them disposable. Spare parts including tips, earbuds and cases are available. The earbuds do not contain any recycled material and Sennheiser does not publish impact assessments or operate trade-in schemes in the UK. The Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 come in a choice of three colours costing £219.99 ($249.95/A$399.5). For comparison, the Sony WF-1000XM4 cost £229, Beats Fit Pro cost £199, Apple AirPods Pro cost £249, the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro cost £219, Jabra Elite 7 Pro cost £199, the Bose QC Earbuds cost £249.95 and the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 cost £99. The third-generation of Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless earbuds are an upgrade in almost all areas. They are some of the best-sounding Bluetooth earbuds you can get, have good noise cancelling, great controls, good battery life and support for the latest aptX Adaptive audio format. Despite still being at the premium end of the market costing £220, they are more competitive thanks to a price cut over their predecessors, too. The case is a little bigger than some, their design a little less interesting than before and they are waiting on an update for multi-point connection, but the worst thing about them is you can’t replace the battery so they are ultimately disposable, losing a star. Pros: top sound, effective noise cancelling, good ambient sound mode, long battery life, very comfortable, optional wings for keeping them in place, aptX Adaptive support, full equaliser, pocketable case, cross-platform app. Cons: expensive, waiting on updates for multi-point and sound customisation, case bigger than some of the best, calls can sound a bit robotic.
