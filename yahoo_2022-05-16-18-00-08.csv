5/16/2022,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary's President Katalin Novak at her inauguration ceremony on Saturday condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine and said her first trip would take her to Poland, in an apparent gesture to mend relations with Warsaw. Hungary's rejection of sending weapons shipments to neighbouring Ukraine and its opposition to a planned European Union embargo on Russian oil imports has weighed on relations between Budapest and Warsaw, whose two nationalist governments have been long-time allies in the EU. Novak, a former Fidesz party lawmaker and ally of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, was elected to the largely ceremonial post of president in March, shortly before Orban won another landslide victory in elections on April 3. Hungary's first woman president, Novak has served as deputy chair of Fidesz and was family affairs minister in Orban's previous government. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's talks with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen about proposed sanctions on Russian oil imports made progress but failed to reach a breakthrough, according to both sides. Maria Tadeo reports on Bloomberg Television. ""On Tuesday, 17 May, I am travelling to Warsaw to meet the President of the Polish people. Mr. President, dear Andrzej (Duda), I thank you for the opportunity to talk as befits friends!,"" Novak said in her inauguration speech. ""We condemn Putin's aggression, the armed invasion of a sovereign state. We say eternally no to every effort aiming at the restoration of the Soviet Union,"" she added. She said the war in Ukraine was also ""fought against us peace -loving Hungarians"", adding that Hungary demanded that war crimes be investigated and punished. Orban has also condemned Russia's attack on Ukraine but has avoided personal criticism of President Vladimir Putin and has been strongly opposed to any sanctions on Russian energy. Dependence on Russian oil in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia poses the biggest obstacle to an embargo deal that the European Commission, the EU executive, proposed in early May in response to Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.

5/16/2022,"A child porn investigation took another disgusting turn when Vancouver police officers found a video of a man peeing in milkshake mix at an Arby’s restaurant, Washington authorities reported. The man, a night manager at the restaurant, told police he urinated in the milkshake mix for sexual gratification at least twice, Vancouver police said in a news release. Police found no indication that Arby’s or other employees were aware of the incidents. “The alleged actions of the former franchised employee are abhorrent and unacceptable,” an Arby’s spokesperson said in a statement to KTTV. “We have taken immediate action with the franchise group who terminated the former employee and is fully cooperating with the authorities in their investigation.” Investigators are seeking anyone who bought a milkshake at the 221 NE 104th Ave. restaurant on Oct. 30 or Oct. 31, the release said. They ask that anyone with a receipt or verified transaction information contact detective Robert Givens at robert.givens@cityofvancouver.us. Another Arby’s manager told police the restaurant sold at least one ice cream float and 30 to 40 milkshakes Oct. 30, The Columbian reported. Detectives in a child porn investigation contacted the man May 10, the release said. He admitted downloading and distributing child pornography, police said. A search of his phone and other digital devices uncovered “dozens of photos and videos depicting the sexual exploitation of children,” the release said.

5/16/2022,"A man in Japan was given his entire town's COVID-19 relief payments by mistake in April, per local media. A formatting issue caused a bank to send $359,000 meant for 463 households to him, reports say. He was discovered to have vanished from his home when the town filed a lawsuit against him in May, local media reported. A man in Japan who received COVID-19 relief payments meant for 463 households in his town last month disappeared after transferring the funds out of his bank account, the local news outlet SoraNews24 reported. The 24-year-old man, who wasn't named, had 46.3 million yen ($358,857) worth of financial aid for the people in Abu, Yamaguchi prefecture, deposited into his bank account on April 8, but refused to give the money back, Asahi Shimbun reported. According to SoraNews24, the man's name was at the top of the town's list of account information sent to the bank, which was confused by a formatting issue that led it to believe the money should be transferred to his account first and later distributed to the rest of the townspeople. The town separately sent the same list to the bank via a floppy disk, though this didn't affect or cause the mix-up, SoraNews24 reported. Once he received the money, the man began to transfer the total sum out of his account in small daily increments to avoid detection, Asahi Shimbun reported. By the time the town authorities caught up with him on April 21, he told them the money was all gone, Asahi Shimbun reported. ""All the funds had been transferred to an account at another financial institution,"" he told them, according to the newspaper. ""I cannot return the money back to the original account. I will make amends for my crime."" On May 12, the town filed a lawsuit against the man demanding repayment of the relief funds and any legal fees, SoraNews24 reported. But he had vanished from his home by then, the outlet reported on Sunday. He hadn't been a long-time resident at Abu; he moved into the town in October 2020 through a government program aimed at repopulating rural areas, per SoraNews24. According to the SoraNews24, town residents described the man as ""a good boy, young and handsome,"" and his landlord told reporters he already paid his rent for the month of May.

5/16/2022,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Its military bogged down in a grinding conflict in eastern Ukraine, Russia lost diplomatic ground over the weekend as two more European nations moved closer to joining NATO. Finland announced Sunday that it was seeking to join the alliance, saying Russia's invasion of Ukraine nearly three months ago had changed Europe’s security landscape. Finland shares a 1,340-kilometer (830-mile) land border and the Gulf of Finland with Russia. Several hours later, Sweden’s governing party endorsed a bid for membership, which could lead to an application in days. Those moves would be a serious blow to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has called NATO’s post-Cold War expansion in Eastern Europe a threat and cited it as a reason for attacking Ukraine. NATO says it is a purely defensive alliance. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, meeting with top diplomats from the alliance in Berlin, said the war “is not going as Moscow had planned."" “Ukraine can win this war,” he said, adding that NATO must continue to offer military support to Kyiv. Britain's Defense Ministry said Monday that Belarus was deploying special operations forces along its border with Ukraine and air defense, artillery and missile units to training ranges in the west of the country. Belarusia's forces have not been directly involved in the conflict, though its territory was used as a staging post for Russia’s initial advance on Kyiv and Chernihiv. Russia has also launched air sorties and missile strikes from Belarus. The presence of Belarusian troops near the border may keep Ukrainian troops pinned down there, preventing them from moving to support the counteroffensive in the Donbas, Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland. Russian and Ukrainian fighters have been battling village-by-village for the Donbas, where Ukraine's military has fought Moscow-backed separatists for eight years. On Sunday, a Ukrainian battalion in the Kharkiv region, where Russian troops have been pushed back by a counteroffensive, reached the Russian border and made a victorious video there addressed to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The video posted on Facebook by Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense shows a dozen fighters around a post covered with blue and yellow, Ukraine’s colors. One said the unit went “to the dividing line with the Russian Federation, the occupying country. Mr. President, we have reached it. We are here.” Other fighters made victory signs and raised their fists. Ukraine's military reported Monday that Russian forces were concentrating on “maintaining positions and preventing the advance of our troops toward the border.” Determining a full picture of the fighting, especially the unfolding battle in the east, is difficult. Airstrikes and artillery barrages make it extremely dangerous for reporters to move around, and both Ukraine and the Moscow-backed separatists fighting in the east restrict reporting from combat zones. The Ukrainian military said that Russian forces were focusing their latest attacks on the Donetsk region in the east, targeting civilian and military sites in multiple towns. Russia troops also continued air and artillery strikes around the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, the last holdout of several hundred Ukrainian forces in the strategically important city, the Ukrainian General Staff said. In an online news conference, many wives of the besieged soldiers urged the international community to help gain the release of “the entire garrison,” which is suffering from a dire lack of food, water and medicine. Turkey’s presidential spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin, said his country had offered to evacuate wounded Ukrainian soldiers and civilians by ship from Azovstal, the official state broadcaster TRT said. Over the weekend, Russian forces hit a chemical plant and 11 high-rise buildings in Siverodonetsk, in the Donbas, regional Gov. Serhii Haidaii said. Russian missiles also destroyed “military infrastructure facilities” in the Yavoriv district of western Ukraine, near the Polish border, the Lviv region's governor said. Lviv is a gateway for Western-supplied weapons to Ukraine. And Ukrainian forces stopped an attempted Russian advance near the eastern city of Izyum, the governor of Ukraine’s Kharkiv region, Oleh Sinegubov, reported. The Ukrainian claims could not be independently verified, but Western officials also painted a somber picture for Russia. Britain’s Defense Ministry estimated that the Russian army had lost up to one-third of the combat strength it committed to Ukraine in late February and was failing to gain any substantial territory. “Under the current conditions, Russia is unlikely to dramatically accelerate its rate of advance over the next 30 days,” the ministry said. Despite the fighting in the wider Kharkiv region and the threat of Russian missile attacks, many people were returning home to Kharkiv and other cities around Ukraine, Anna Malyar, deputy head of the Ministry of Defense, said. Refugees were returning not just because of optimism that the war might ebb. “Living somewhere just like that, not working, paying for housing, eating ... they are forced to return for financial reasons,” Malyar said in remarks carried by the RBK-Ukraine news agency. Countries neighboring Russia and Ukraine worry they could be next after Russia invaded Ukraine. Sweden's parliament on Monday was to discuss joining NATO after the ruling Social Democratic Party endorsed a plan to do so. An announcement by the Cabinet was expected to follow. During a visit to Sweden, U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said Sunday that Finland and Sweden would be “important additions” to NATO and that the U.S. should swiftly ratify their membership. A delegation of GOP senators led by McConnell made a surprise visit to Kyiv on Saturday. NATO operates by consensus, however, and Turkey has cast doubts over adding Finland and Sweden as members. Ukraine celebrated a morale-boosting victory on Saturday night in the Eurovision Song Contest. The folk-rap ensemble Kalush Orchestra won the glitzy pan-European competition with its song “Stefania,” which has become a Ukrainian wartime anthem. Zelenskyy vowed his nation would claim the customary winner’s honor of hosting the next annual competition. “Step by step, we are forcing the occupiers to leave the Ukrainian land,” Zelenskyy said. The band’s frontman, Oleh Psiuk, said at a news conference Sunday that the musicians were “ready to fight” when they return home. Ukraine’s government prohibits men between 18 and 60 from leaving the country, but the all-male band’s six members got special permission to go to Italy to represent Ukraine in the contest. ___ McQuillan reported from Lviv, Ukraine.

5/16/2022,"Russia's thwarted attempt to cross the Siverskyi Donets River in northeastern Ukraine last week ""is emerging as among the deadliest engagements of the war, with estimates based on publicly available evidence now suggesting that well over 400 Russian soldiers were killed or wounded,"" The New York Times reports. ""And as the scale of what happened comes into sharper focus, the disaster appears to be breaking through the Kremlin's tightly controlled information bubble."" Russia reportedly committed about 550 troops to its highly risky May 11 effort to cross the Donets River at Bilohorivka, to encircle Ukrainian forces near Rubizhne. Ukraine destroyed the pontoon bridges and also, according to Britain's Ministry of Defense, ""significant armored maneuver elements of at least one Battalion Tactical Group."" Most strikingly, pro-Russia war bloggers are publicly criticizing Russia's military effort, the Times reports. ""The last straw that overwhelmed my patience was the events around Bilohorivka, where due to stupidity — I emphasize, because of the stupidity of the Russian command — at least one battalion tactical group was burned, possibly two,"" war blogger Yuri Podolyaka told his 2.1 million followers. Another popular blogger, who goes by Starshe Eddy, blamed the exposure of so many Russian troops on ""not idiocy, but direct sabotage,"" by commanders. ""The commentary by these widely read milbloggers may fuel burgeoning doubts in Russia about Russia's prospects in this war and the competence of Russia's military leaders,"" the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think take wrote over the weekend. Britain's Ministry of Defense said Sunday that ""Russia has now likely suffered losses of one-third of the ground combat force it committed in February."" This dire assessment of Russia's fortunes ""is in stark contrast to briefings coming from the Kremlin, which still paint the invasion as making steady progress,"" BBC News reports. ""The failed Russian attempts to cross the Siverskyi Donets River"" has likely curtailed the Kremlin's ambitions to seize Donetsk Oblast and encircle Ukrainian troops on a wide scale, ISW assessed Sunday. ""Even with its setbacks, Russia continues to inflict death and destruction across Ukraine,"" The Associated Press reports. But Ukraine is drawing morale boosts from its victory at Bilohorivka and successful counteroffensive north and east of Kharkiv. One Ukrainian battalion even pushed all the way to the Russia border, then posted a celebratory video addressed to Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky.

5/16/2022,"By Mark Trevelyan LONDON (Reuters) -Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Saturday that Moscow was the target of ""total hybrid war"" by the West but would withstand sanctions by forging deeper partnerships with China, India and others. In a speech on the 80th day since Russia invaded Ukraine, Lavrov pointed to the barrage of sanctions imposed by the West in an effort to portray Russia as the target, not the perpetrator, of aggression. ""The collective West has declared total hybrid war on us and it is hard to predict how long all this will last but it is clear the consequences will be felt by everyone, without exception,"" he said. ""We did everything to avoid a direct clash - but now that the challenge has been thrown down, we of course accept it. We are no strangers to sanctions: they were almost always there in one form or another."" The sanctions on Russia's top companies, banks and political elite have been imposed to punish it for a war that has killed tens of thousands of people and uprooted millions, disrupted energy markets and exacerbated a global food crisis by driving up prices for grain, cooking oils and fertiliser. In his speech, Lavrov laid out the strategy that Moscow is pinning its hopes on as it tries to cushion the hit to its economy and build new markets elsewhere. He cited the sanctions, which have included the seizure of nearly half of Russia's $640 billion in foreign reserves, as evidence that no one is safe against expropriation and ""state piracy"", and of the need for countries to lessen economic reliance on the United States and its allies. ""Not only Russia but many others too are reducing dependence on the U.S. dollar, western technology and markets,"" he said, without stating evidence. Efforts by the West to isolate Russia were doomed to fail, he said. Russia's relations with China were the best they had ever been and it was developing a privileged strategic partnership with India. Just back from a trip to the Middle East, he also cited the importance of ties with Egypt, Algeria and Gulf nations, as well as Asia, Africa and Latin America. In one example of a sanctions-induced pivot in exports, Russia sold twice as much crude oil to India in the two months after its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine as it did in all of 2021, as Western nations cut purchases of Russian oil and Indian refiners seized the chance to buy it at a discount. Yet despite Russia's insistence it can thrive under sanctions, its economy is on track to shrink by somewhere between 8.8% and 12.4%, according to an economy ministry document seen by Reuters, and not return to its pre-invasion size before 2026. Annual consumer inflation accelerated in April to 17.83%, its highest since 2002.

5/16/2022,"If Roe v. Wade is overturned by the Supreme Court, Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts wants to ban abortion in his state, and he wants that ban to apply to victims of rape. CNN’s State of the Union host Dana Bash asked the governor about a recent effort he supported to pass a “trigger” abortion ban that would go into effect immediately if the Supreme Court rules to overturn abortion rights, which appears to be imminent considering the recently leaked Supreme Court draft opinion. More from Rolling Stone The Problem With Ricki Lake's 'The Business of Birth Control' Nancy Pelosi Says Anti-Choice Democrats Are Fine as Long as ... Their Votes Don't Matter Senate Officially Throws Middle Finger to Reproductive Rights “Nebraska, your state, does not have a so-called trigger law on the books. But there was an effort, as you know, to pass one,” Bash said in a Sunday interview with Ricketts. “It failed by only two votes last month. The abortion ban that you tried to pass did not include any exceptions for rape or incest.” The host then asked, “Do you think that the state of Nebraska should require a young girl who was raped to carry that pregnancy to term?” Ricketts replied, “So, Nebraska is a pro-life state. I believe life begins at conception. And those are babies too. So, if Roe vs. Wade, which was a horrible constitutional decision, gets overturned by the Supreme Court, which we’re hopeful of, here in Nebraska, we’re going to take further steps to protect those pre-born babies.” “Including in the case of rape or incest?” Bash clarified. “They’re still babies too. Yes, they’re still babies,” the Republican replied. Bash next asked the governor if he would call a special session of the Nebraska legislature to impose an abortion ban following a Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe, Ricketts said, “That would certainly be my intention.” Also on Sunday, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt endorsed his state’s law banning abortion that includes no exceptions for rape or incest. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt to rape and incest victims who won't be able to get abortions in his state: ""Our heart is super compassionate about that."" pic.twitter.com/BjB6XtVvoG — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) May 15, 2022 “Now, your law as I understand, it has no exemptions for rape or incest. And the argument is a victim may not know at six weeks that she is pregnant,” host Shannon Bream said to Stitt when he appeared on Fox News Sunday. “So, what do you say to a woman who finds herself in that situation, lives in your state and feels like she’s got no options?” “Well, first off, super compassionate about that. I have daughters, cannot even imagine what that would be like and that hardship,” Stitt responded. But despite his superficial compassion, Stitt would still force victims to have a baby. “You have to choose,” Stitt continued. “That is a human being inside the womb. And we’re going to do everything we can to protect life and love both the mother and the child. And we don’t think that killing one to protect another is the right thing to do either.” Bream followed-up by asking Stitt how he as governor will help these children conceived in trauma and born by force, considering Oklahoma’s abysmal track record in child wellbeing (it ranks 42nd in the nation). Stitt went on to blast the “socialist Democrat left” and said it is “just ridiculous to even kind of quote those types of stats.” “We have a free market in Oklahoma,” Stitt said. “We believe that God has a special plan for every single life and every single child, and we want everybody to have the same opportunities in Oklahoma. And aborting a child is not the right answer.” Ricketts and Stitt join fellow Republican Governor Tate Reeves of Mississippi in callously defending abortion laws without certain exemptions. Last week, Reeves defended Mississippi’s trigger law that would force victims of incest to have their assailant’s child if they become pregnant. Even abortion bans with rape and incest exceptions are dangerous to pregnant people. Although a person may be eligible for an exception in a state where the law includes such allowances, it is still often extremely difficult or impossible for them to obtain an abortion because those laws can contain requirements, like mandating a rape victim file a police report in order to qualify. “These exceptions don’t do the job that people think they’re going to do,” Elizabeth Nash, a policy analyst at the Guttmacher Institute, told The Atlantic. Abortion bans without exceptions are becoming increasingly popular in the U.S. At least ten states — including Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, and Oklahoma — have passed abortion bans lacking exceptions for rape, incest, or both. While most of those laws have been blocked by courts, they could go into effect in the very likely event that Roe is overturned.

5/16/2022,"In a Dallas suburb last week, a whip-cracking 9-year-old white boy came to the front porch of one of his neighbors and banged on their door while demanding to confront a Black child in the home. A Ring camera video of the moment went viral after it was posted to social media. The parents of the Black girl, Carissa Nash and her husband Dee Nash, say they posted the video to highlight how local law enforcement told them the boy is too young to face any criminal penalties. But the boy’s father, Bryan Thomas Brunson, is not, and he later would be arrested for his actions in the aftermath of the incident. “This kid comes to my door with a whip looking for my 9-year-old daughter, then puts a big ass scratch on our Audi,” Carissa wrote of the incident that took place on Thursday, May 12, in Kaufman County Texas. “The police came out and tells us, ‘it’ll work itself out since he moving soon.’” She also communicated what happened when they went to the child’s home. Saying that when her husband returned home, the two of them went to talk to the child and his family “about the damages done” to their vehicle. First, the mom says she could hear the boy’s father tell him to lie and say he is not home, but minutes later the man emerges and “comes to the door with a gun.” “He almost shot himself and his daughter standing behind him,” she wrote. The couple posted a video of their visit to the 9-year-old’s home on YouTube. In the footage, Dee is seen talking to the father, who says the reason why he has a Ruger semi-automatic pistol is because they have had beef before. Dee then attempts to show the man the Ring video of what transpired at their home, but Brunson tells them to leave his property. An argument ensues between the two men in Brunson’s driveway, and the boy’s father places the firearm on the ground. When he picks it up, he accidentally pulls the trigger, and the camera records the sound of a shot. Carissa is heard saying, “y’all is so violent.” The Nashes called the police and were told no charges could be filed on the boy because he was a 9, a year too young to face criminal mischief charges. However, TMZ reports that the Kaufman County Constable Precinct 2 Chief Administrator Jason Johnson, confirmed the bullet almost struck Brunson’s own daughter who was standing behind him. The father reportedly was hit with a felony charge of deadly conduct. The Nashes, who have made multiple somewhat inconsistent social media posts about why the boy was at their door, say it all started because the upset boy claimed he got into a fight with the couple’s 13-year-old son — although another narrative says it was their 9-year-old daughter — while he was coming home from school. The couple contends it would have been impossible for the son to be involved because the two minors attend separate schools. “The kid claimed as he was walking home and was jumped by our son,” Dee Nash said online. “Our son is 13 years old. He gets out of school two hours after the 9-year-old gets out of school. So there’s no way our son could have touched or even seen this 9-year-old kid.” The Nashes also say this is not the first incident they’ve encountered with this same boy, stating the boy has claimed that their son assaulted him before. The father says he has social media posts dating back to 2019 regarding the blond child. Dee and Carissa Nash both took to Instagram with videos offering an account of what precipitated Thursday’s events, saying the white boy and their 9-year-old daughter, Jordan, had tussled earlier that day. “We spoke with a group of kids that walk home with a 9-year-old, as well as my daughter, and the entire group,” the father shared. “The 9-year-old kid was saying rude things to the group of kids.” Carissa Nash said the boy shouted out racial slurs to the other kids. Other Black children allegedly got into an altercation with the child, and he took his skateboard and started hitting the others around him. He struck one girl and her brother beat him up. Carissa said, “There was a brother and he got in there and said, ‘I had to defend my sister. He was hitting my sister.’” The couple claims what happened next was the 9-year-old hit the Nashes’ daughter, Jordan Nash, and she defended herself. The child was furious that the girl was fighting back. To make matters worse, while she was fighting the child, another boy pushed him from the back into some water. When he got up, the first person he saw was Jordan and he viciously attacked her. Jordan came home and told Carissa what the entire ordeal was. While they were talking the boy came to the door. A Ring camera, located on the Nash family’s door, captured the boy approaching their porch and banging on the door. In his hands, he had a whip and he snapped it a couple of times at the door. He waited for someone to answer his frantic address. When Carissa opened the door, she chastised him for causing such a ruckus and disrespecting her home. She is heard on the clip saying, “Little boy, you better get your ass up and off my porch before I call the police, beating on my door like this! I will call the police, you need to leave. Don’t you ever beat on my godd-mn like that.

""It doesn't require a huge leap to figure out why one of the wealthiest individuals on Earth opposes an economic agenda for the middle class that cuts some of the biggest costs families face, fights inflation for the long haul, and adds to the historic deficit reduction the President is achieving by asking the richest taxpayers and corporations to pay their fair share,"" White House spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement to The Washington Post's Jeff Stein. Bates went on: ""It's also unsurprising that this tweet comes after the President met with labor organizers, including Amazon employees."" Earlier that day Bezos had criticized President Joe Biden's administration for trying to pass a social and climate spending package once known as Build Back Better. He argued it amounted to ""more stimulus into an already over-heated, inflationary economy and only Manchin saved them from themselves."" That was a reference to Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a conservative Democrat who tanked the spending plan in late December. Democrats have been unable to revive a smaller version of the package so far, and Manchin has swerved on whether he's interested to back a bill. Democrats can't approve the plan over unified GOP resistance without his support in the 50-50 Senate. Biden's Build Back Better plan is different from the $1.9 trillion stimulus package that he signed into law in March 2021. The stimulus was meant as a one-time relief effort to flood the economy with direct payments and unemployment benefits for individuals, aid to state and local governments, and money for public-health systems. The federal government didn't raise revenue to finance that spending, so it was added to the national debt. Some experts say it worsened inflation since it overpowered demand. Supply-chain bottlenecks and other pandemic-related disruptions have been a persistent factor in rising prices for groceries and gas. The Build Back Better plan was intended to be fully paid for with tax hikes on the wealthiest Americans. While that bill has been on the back burner, Biden has been focused on repackaging his agenda to combat inflation as well as touting his labor credentials. He hosted union organizers from Amazon and Starbucks earlier this month.

5/16/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) -Russia has probably lost around a third of the ground forces it deployed to Ukraine and its offensive in the Donbas region ""has lost momentum and fallen significantly behind schedule"", British military intelligence said on Sunday. ""Despite small-scale initial advances, Russia has failed to achieve substantial territorial gains over the past month whilst sustaining consistently high levels of attrition,"" the British defence ministry said on Twitter. ""Russia has now likely suffered losses of one third of the ground combat force it committed in February."" It said Russia was unlikely to dramatically accelerate its rate of advance over the next 30 days. Since Russia's invasion on Feb. 24, Ukraine's military has forced Russia's commanders to abandon an advance on the capital Kyiv, before making rapid gains in the northeast and driving them away from the second biggest city of Kharkiv. A Ukrainian counteroffensive has been under way near the Russian-held town of Izium, though Ukraine's military reported on Sunday that Russian forces were advancing elsewhere in the Donbas region, the main theatre of war over the past month.

5/16/2022,"The Terra ecosystem completely unraveled last week, taking much of the cryptocurrency market down with it. Its algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) crashed far below its $1 peg, and its sister token Luna collapsed to nearly zero. Though the overall market is now recovering, the demise of UST and Luna wiped out many cryptocurrency investors’ life savings. This left the Terra community, including its creator Do Kwon, proposing plans to somehow fix the damage done. One proposal on the Terra forum suggests that Terra should make investors “whole” again with its remaining funds—and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is all for it, with a few tweaks. Buterin agreed with one Twitter user who said that Terra should prioritize helping “smaller wallets,” or people who had “a couple thousand or more of UST deposited in Anchor,” rather than “rich whales.” “​​If Terra just focussed on the ‘poorest’ 99.6% of wallets, then they could make this gigantic group 100% whole,” the user Tweeted on Friday. Buterin retweeted the user on Saturday, saying: “Strongly support this. Coordinated sympathy and relief for the average UST smallholder who got told something dumb about ‘20% interest rates on the US dollar’ by an influencer, personal responsibility and SFYL [or sorry for your loss] for the wealthy.” https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1525562865016483841 He added that the “obvious precedent is FDIC insurance,” being “up to $250,000 per person.” The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is a federal agency that dates back to the 1930s, a Great Depression-era regulation that represented the first time the government backed bank deposits in U.S. history. It was part of the New Deal series of government programs that restored faith in the financial system, yet came under criticism of too much government involvement in business. Buterin stopped short of endorsing regulation for the until-now unregulated crypto space, but he said similar regulations were “interesting.” His comments are newsworthy in light of President Joe Biden signing an executive order in March, directing the government to ""“ensure responsible innovation in digital assets,"" with the crypto community wondering what ""responsible"" means. “An interesting unrelated one is Singapore employment law,"" Buterin tweeted. ""Stronger regulation for low-earning employees, and a more figure-it-out-yourself approach for the wealthier. IMO [or in my opinion] things like this are good hybrid formulas.” Buterin also criticized algorithmic stablecoins on Twitter, saying that “‘algostable’ has become a propaganda term serving to legitimize uncollateralized stables by putting them in the same bucket as collateralized stables.” He added that “we need to really emphasize that the two are very different.” UST is an algorithmic stablecoin, which means it has no reserves. Instead, it holds value based on an algorithm that is coded to strike a balance between the stablecoin and a partner coin, in this case, Luna. Every time a UST token is minted, the equivalent of $1 in Luna is burned, or removed from circulation, and vice versa, to maintain the peg. As the UST stablecoin dropped, it brought its sister token Luna down with it. UST is trading at around 14 cents, down 85% in the last seven days. Luna remains at a 100% loss in the same timeframe, trading at pretty much zero.

5/16/2022,"The FBI is investigating Saturday’s mass killing that left 10 people dead and three injured in Buffalo, New York, as a hate crime, the agency said. FBI officials said it is “aggressively investigating” the attack as “an instance of racially motivated violent extremism.” Authorities say Payton Gendron, a heavily armed white 18-year-old man, entered the Tops Friendly Markets store in a predominately Black neighborhood around 2:30 p.m. and unloaded a fusillade of bullets. He identifies himself as a white supremacist. Witnesses said Gendron wore camouflage and looked like he was “in the army.” Reports show he was clad in body armor. The shooter broadcast the onslaught on Twitch, a live-streaming platform. Eleven of the victims were Black, and two were white. “It was straight-up, racially motivated hate crime from somebody outside of our community, outside of the city of good neighbors, as the mayor said, coming into our community and trying to inflict that evil upon us,” Erie County Sheriff John Garcia said in a press briefing. Gendron pleaded not guilty to first-degree felony charges Saturday night. Erie County District Attorney John J. Flynn said it is the highest murder charge in the state. Flynn said he pushed for the suspect to be arraigned Saturday night. “We are now investigating terrorism charges, other murder charges, along with working with our partners in the federal government so that they can perhaps file charges as well. So I assure everyone in this community, justice is being done right now, and justice will be done,” Flynn said during a briefing. Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia said Gendron drove hours away from his home in Broome County, New York — more than 200 miles from Buffalo — to commit the crime. He killed three people in the store’s parking lot before exchanging gunfire with a security guard inside, killing the retired police officer. Six of the people Gendron killed were customers, and four were employees. The assailant later surrendered to police after he “put the gun to his own neck,” according to reports. “It’s like walking onto a horror movie, but everything is real. It is Armageddon-like,” a police official at the scene told Buffalo News. “It is so overwhelming.” Katherine Crofton told reporters she saw the suspect shoot a woman going into the store and another putting away groceries. A dairy worker, Will G., told the Buffalo News he heard shots while restocking milk. He and others hid in the cooler. However, some who hid near cash registers did not escape the killer’s deadly ammo, reports show. Others jetted outside and around the store to search for their loved ones and co-workers in the chaos. “I just heard shots. Shots and shots and shots,” Will G. said. “It sounded like things were falling over.” Witnesses said the suspect initially ignored officers’ commands “like he wanted them to shoot him” before they took him down. Gendron faces life without parole for the state felony murder charge. The judge Saturday ordered a forensic examination, and the suspect must return to court in five days for a felony hearing. Media allowed to record, but no live stream. Suspect is inside the courtroom as we await arraignment. @WKBW https://t.co/beFsjtJylJ pic.twitter.com/e9MyMXNdSW — Eileen Buckley (@eileenwkbw) May 14, 2022 Law enforcement officials received a warrant to search Gendron’s home Saturday evening. Investigators are reportedly combing through a 106-page manifesto connected to the shooting that shows admiration for South Carolina church shooter Dylann Roof and the New Zealand mosque shooter Brenton Tarrant, ABC News reports. According to reports, Gendron’s online manifesto shows he developed racist views in recent years, which grew more radical over the past three. Gendron had been “passively preparing” for the massacre for several years, The New York Times reports. He stocked up ammunition and protective gear and occasionally held target practice. In May 2020, Gendron started following anonymous chatter on “white replacement theory.” “If there’s one thing I want you to get from these writings, it’s that White birth rates must change. Everyday the White population becomes fewer in number,” the manifesto reportedly says. “To maintain a population the people must achieve a birth rate that reaches replacement fertility levels, in the western world that is about 2.06 births per woman.” Gendron also created a timeline for the attack, including a layout of the store. The self-proclaimed white supremacist mapped out his parking space, selected his meal beforehand and picked the spot where he would start the live stream. He wrote down his plan to kill the security guard and shoot Black shoppers twice in the chest if he could, reports show. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul slammed Twitch and social medial companies for not taking action against hate speech on their platforms, demanding they be held accountable for allowing “this hate to be spewed and others who are like-minded to be radicalized.” “A community was shattered by an individual, a white supremacist, who has engaged in an act of terrorism and will be prosecuted as such in a cold-hearted, calculated way, a military-style execution targeting people who simply want to buy groceries in a neighborhood store,” Hochul said during a briefing.

5/16/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) -White, brightly burning munitions were shown cascading down on the Azovstal steel works in the Ukrainian port of Mariupol in what a British military expert said looked like either an attack with phosphorus or incendiary weapons. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said ""delicate"" negotiations were proceeding on rescuing Ukrainian servicemen holed up beneath the vast complex. A Ukrainian officer among the remaining defenders said 600 fighters remained, 40 of them seriously injured. Civilians have been evacuated from the labyrinth of bunkers. Reuters was not able to immediately identify the type of munitions being used on the Azovstal complex or when the video was taken. It was posted on Sunday on the Telegram messaging application by Alexander Khodakovsky, a commander of the pro-Russian self-proclaimed republic of Donetsk. ""If you didn't know what it is and for what purpose - you could say that it's even beautiful,"" Khodakovsky said in a message beside the video. Khodakovsky could not be immediately reached for comment. It was not immediately clear which forces had fired the munitions, or from where. NOT ENOUGH MEDICINE OR SURGICAL EQUIPMENT Denys Shlega, a commander of Ukraine's National Guard, described conditions beneath the plant as dire. ""There is not enough medicine or surgical equipment,"" Shlega told Ukrainian television. ""At the moment, we have about 600 people who are injured. About 40 in a very serious condition."" Shlega said Russian forces had penetrated into parts of the steel plant ""but this is not yet significant and we are holding on ... holding on with our last forces."" Russian forces have pummeled Mariupol for nearly two months. Russia has not commented on what specific weapons it has used to attack the plant. The Russian defence ministry did not reply to a written request for comment about the video. Ukraine's armed forces declined to make an immediate official comment. The prosecutor's office said it had launched an investigation into possible use of incendiary weapons. White phosphorus munitions can be used on battlefields to make smoke screens, generate illumination, mark targets or burn bunkers and buildings. White phosphorus is not banned as a chemical weapon under international conventions. Human rights groups have urged a ban on the use of phosphorus munitions because of the severe burns they cause. The United States used phosphorus munitions in the Vietnam war and the 2003-2011 Iraq war. Russia used them in the Chechen wars. Petro Andryushchenko, an aide to Mariupol's mayor, said that Russia had used incendiary or phosphorous bombs on Azovstal. Andryushchenko was speaking from Ukrainian-controlled territory. Reuters was unable to immediately verify his comments. Hamish Stephen de Bretton-Gordon, a former commanding officer of Britain's Joint Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Regiment, said it looked very much like phosphorus in the video, but only a sample could give absolute confirmation. ""It does look very much like white phosphorus rockets or artillery shells which are exploding just above the ground or upon the ground,"" he told Reuters.

5/16/2022,"ATLANTA (AP) — A federal trial for reality television stars Todd and Julie Chrisley on charges including bank fraud and tax evasion is set to start Monday in Atlanta. The trial is getting underway just days after E! announced that it is moving forward with a new dating series, “Love Limo,” hosted by Todd Chrisley and weeks after the announcement that reality shows “Chrisley Knows Best” and “Growing Up Chrisley” have been renewed on USA Network and E!, respectively. The Chrisleys were initially indicted in August 2019 and a new indictment was filed in February of this year. Prosecutors allege that the couple submitted fake documents to banks when applying for loans. Julie Chrisley also submitted a false credit report and fake bank statements when trying to rent a house in California, and then the couple refused to pay rent a few months after they started using the home, the indictment says. The Chrisleys also used a film production company they controlled to hide income to keep the IRS from collecting unpaid taxes owed by Todd Chrisley, prosecutors say. Both Chrisleys are charged with one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, five counts of bank fraud, one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and one count of tax fraud. Julie Chrisley is also charged with one count of wire fraud and one count of obstruction of justice. Peter Tarantino, an accountant hired by the Chrisleys, is charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and two counts of willfully filing false tax returns. He is set to stand trial alongside the Chrisleys. The Chrisleys and Tarantino have pleaded not guilty to the charges and have been free on bond. U.S. District Judge Eleanor Ross has said jury selection will take place Monday with opening statements expected on Tuesday. “Chrisley Knows Best” follows the tight-knit, boisterous Chrisley family. The series was just renewed by USA for a 10th season, while spinoff “Growing Up Chrisley,” featuring Chrisley kids Chase and Savannah living in Los Angeles, was just renewed for a fourth season. The family had moved to Tennessee by the time the indictment was filed but the criminal charges stem from when they lived in Atlanta’s northern suburbs, prosecutors have said. Before the initial indictment was even announced in August 2019, Todd Chrisley posted a lengthy statement on Instagram denying any wrongdoing. A former employee who was fired after the Chrisleys discovered in 2012 that he was stealing from them retaliated by bringing phony documents to the U.S. attorney’s office and telling prosecutors the Chrisleys had committed financial crimes, Chrisley wrote. Prosecutors have said the Chrisleys directed that former employee to falsify documents. The scheme lasted from at least 2007 to 2012 and involved submitting fake bank and financial statements to financial institutions to get millions of dollars in loans, much of which they used for their personal benefit, the indictment says. They tried to hide their involvement by falsely claiming they didn't know their then-employee had submitted false documents, the indictment says. Julie Chrisley sent a fake credit report and bank statements showing far more money than they had in their accounts to a California property owner in July 2014 while trying to rent a home, the indictment says. A few months after they began using the home, in October 2014, they refused to pay rent, causing the owner to have to threaten them with eviction. Money the Chrisleys received from their television show went to a company they controlled called 7C's Productions, but they didn't declare it as income on federal tax returns, prosecutors said. The couple failed to file or pay their federal income taxes on time for multiple years, the indictment says. Tarantino helped the Chrisleys hide income and lie about their tax returns, telling the IRS that Todd Chrisley didn't have enough money to pay a tax debt from 2009 despite money coming into their production company that they spent on personal purchases, the indictment says. He also filed false corporate tax returns for 7C's Productions to make it look like the company wasn't making money, the indictment says. After federal agents served a grand jury subpoena on 7C's Productions in February 2018, Julie Chrisley submitted a fraudulent document, the indictment says.",U.S./Associated Press,'Chrisley Knows Best' stars to stand trial in Atlanta,https://news.yahoo.com/chrisley-knows-best-stars-stand-125601974.html
5/16/2022,"A Ukrainian man walks past a destroyed Russian tank in a damaged field as Russian attacks continue in Chernihiv Oblast, Ukraine on May 12, 2022. Credit - Dogukan Keskinkilic-Anadolu Agency It has been said that, given how massively Ukrainian troops were believed be outmatched early in Russia’s invasion, not losing the war is itself a form of victory for Ukraine. The difference between expectations and the surprising resilience of Ukraine’s military makes it easy to misinterpret the current situation in Ukraine’s favor. But not winning is still not winning. Ukraine is in far worse shape than commonly believed and needs, and will continue to need, a staggering amount of aid and support to actually win. We love an underdog. We love a plucky little guy who beats the odds. It fuels hope for our ordinary selves and allows us to feel we are on the morally superior side. This is why Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has appealed so successfully to the world. His defiance against the odds gave us someone to root for against a bully. While cheering on the scrappy, outmatched Ukrainians, we could also assuage some of our shame at leaving them—to whom we had made promises of protection, “security guarantees”—to die alone in the snow and the mud. Unfortunately, Zelensky’s leadership and the outpouring of international military and humanitarian assistance it has elicited have not prevented a shocking level of destruction to Ukraine’s cities, economy, and society. The fact that Kyiv has not fallen and Russian troops have retreated to the east masks that Ukraine is in worse shape than portrayed in the media. It is worth remembering that Ukraine has been fighting a Russian invasion since 2014. Between 2014 and February 2022, almost 10,000 were killed in the simmering war in the Donbas, but little or no military progress was made. Now, Ukraine is fighting with that same army in an expanded theater against a bigger opposing force. It is a testament to the pure valiance of its troops that Ukraine has managed since February 24 not only to hold its line but force the Russians into a retreat from Kyiv, Kharkiv, Chernigiv, and surrounding areas. Nonetheless, Russia now controls significantly more Ukrainian territory than before February 24. Putin’s army holds Kherson, whatever is left of Mariupol, all the intervening territory, and now not only Luhansk and Donetsk but the entire Donbas Oblast. For example, whereas Ukrainian authorities controlled approximately 60% of Luhansk before the recent Russian invasion, now Russian forces control over 80% of the region. They also have about 70% of Zaporizhye region. Cumulatively, this accounts for an increase of Russian occupied territory from approximately 7%, including Crimea, before February more than double that now. Viewed this way, not losing looks a lot more like losing than winning. Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense is not releasing combat casualty numbers to maintain morale, but experts believe it has lost at least 25,000 troops — up to 11,000 deaths and 18,000 wounded —since the February 24 invasion. Over two and a half months into the war, Ukraine’s losses are at least 10% of their now undoubtedly exhausted army of under 250,000. This is, however, many, many fewer than Russia’s casualties, believed to be over 35,000, and buttressed by an astonishing loss of weapons and equipment, such as tanks and warships. Read More: Inside Volodymyr Zelensky’s World  Ukraine’s relative success is due in part to the weapons at least 31 western governments have been donating. The U.K. has sent anti-tank, anti-air, and anti-ship missiles, air defense systems, and other weapons; Slovakia the S-300 air defense system; the U.S. drones, howitzers, missiles, and anti-armor systems; and this is just a sampling. These weapons have allowed Ukraine to maximize its home field advantage, leverage its troops’ greater resolve, and exploit Russia’s military weaknesses and apparent lack of adequate planning and preparation. Without these donations, Kyiv may well have fallen by now. While Ukraine is flush with weapons and other military supplies and equipment, however, Ministry of Defense officials and volunteer fighters are both quietly admitting that they lack the capacity to absorb so much aid. Much of the equipment and weaponry requires new training to be used. Even when that is available it takes time. Similarly, the influx of 16,000 or more foreign volunteer fighters would seem like a decisive boon, but in fact almost none of them had any military experience or training. They proved little more than extra mouths to feed in most cases, according to Ministry of Defense staff and some of the volunteer foreign special forces soldiers on the ground. Economically, Ukraine is surviving, but only that. The sanctions on Russia that are expected to cause a less than 7% contraction in GDP compare rather unfavorably to the 45-50% GDP collapse Ukraine is facing. At least 25% of businesses are closed, although the number that have completely stopped has fallen from 32% in March to 17% in May. But a Black Sea blockade of Ukraine’s ports—Mariupol, Odesa, Kherson, and others—by Russia’s navy is preventing both the import of fuels to power the agricultural sector, and also the export of grain and other Ukrainian products. The inability to export is costing Ukraine’s economy $170 million per day. Meanwhile, Russia is targeting Ukrainian fuel storages, grain silos, and agricultural equipment warehouses, damaging already tattered supply chains. The power sector is facing default because so few Ukrainian citizens and companies are able to pay their electricity bills. Not only is May a critical agricultural month, but it is when Naftogaz usually starts buying natural gas to store it for the cold Ukrainian winter. The state-owned energy giant was already in bad shape before the invasion, with the CEO asking the Ukrainian government for a $4.6 billion bailout in September 2021. Now, with very tight gas markets and no funds, it is unclear how the country can prepare for winter, when temperatures can fall to below 20 Fahrenheit. Adding to the prospect of a tragic 2022-2023 winter, most of Ukraine’s coal mines are in the Donbas, where Russia’s offensive continues. The White House is reportedly considering forgiving Ukrainian sovereign debt, which would undoubtedly help Bankova (the Ukrainian White House equivalent). So too will, among other efforts, the €15 billion in debt securities the European Commission plans to issue to cover Ukraine’s next few months. However, this will not coax back the over six million mostly women and children who have fled Ukraine. If men were allowed to leave, the numbers would almost certainly be double. Recent reports that 25,000-30,000 are returning daily to Ukraine from abroad are encouraging, but Ukraine faced a brain drain problem before the invasion. The poorest country in Europe, many citizens were already trying to leave. Before the war, Ukrainians were the third largest immigrant population in the E.U., behind only Morocco and Turkey. Now, the International Labor Agency estimates that 4.8 million jobs have been lost in Ukraine, which will rise to seven million if the war continues. And after many months of war, children will have settled in new schools abroad, mothers will be integrating in their new worlds, and both will be waiting for their husbands and fathers to join them. Some will return to Ukraine, of course, but many will prioritize their family’s comfort and children’s opportunities over the calls of patriotism. Most troublingly, many Ukrainians still in their country have begun to wonder how it will rebuild itself. The war has torn the fabric of society. One mother in Poltava said she no longer trusts the neighbors she has lived next to for 40 years, people she considered to be family before the invasion. A young volunteer, formerly a civil society activist, described hunting for saboteurs, and how he has begun to see Russian sympathizers everywhere. Native Ukrainian speakers of Russian, who constitute at least a third of the population, are uncomfortable or even scared to use their mother tongue. Trust has been shattered, even while nationalism has been motivated. No matter how quickly Russia is beaten back, rebuilding communities will be a challenge. The U.S. government decided in May to symbolically move some of its diplomatic staff back into Kyiv, partially reversing its rapid, defeatist withdrawal when it assumed Kyiv would fall within days. President Biden has even, finally, nominated a U.S. ambassador to Ukraine after more than a three-year leadership gap. The message this and E.U. gestures send is important. But despite our desire to see in outmatched Ukraine’s survival a tale of David beating Goliath, and to cheer ourselves for donating the slingshot, the country is seriously, dangerously weakened. Ukraine needs more than symbols, and more than weapons. Not losing is not winning, and it will take a long and deep commitment by the western world to help Ukraine both win and then heal.",World/Time,Ukraine Is in Worse Shape than You Think,https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-worse-shape-think-110010914.html

The billionaire later clarified: ""I'm not suggesting malice in the algorithm, but rather that it's trying to guess what you might want to read and, in doing so, inadvertently manipulate/amplify your viewpoints without you realizing this is happening"".

The SpaceX founder and chief executive appeared to have turned his attention back to the rocket company as he met with Indonesian president Joko Widodo on Saturday at its site in Boca Chica, Texas.

5/16/2022,"PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — A Rhode Island dog whose inspiring story of going from shelter dog to lifesaving police K-9 became the subject of a recent Netflix movie has been euthanized. State Police said Sunday K-9 Ruby was put down Friday following a “sudden, acute, and untreatable illness.” She was 11 years old. Col. Darnell Weaver, superintendent of the state police, expressed gratitude for K-9 Ruby's years of service. “K-9 Ruby dedicated her life to serve the citizens of Rhode Island and make a positive impact on every person she ever interacted with,"" he said in a statement. “She became a symbol of hope for all shelter dogs, showing the world what a shelter dog can do when just given love and the chance to shine.” Ruby served with the Rhode Island State Police for 11 years and was handled by Corporal Daniel O’Neil, Weaver said. Part Australian shepherd and part border collie, Ruby was one of the first shelter dogs trained to serve with the Rhode Island State Police. She participated in numerous search-and-rescue missions and made many public appearances during her career. Ruby gained notoriety in 2017 when she located a teenage boy who was severely injured while hiking in the woods. The boy turned out to be the son of the animal shelter volunteer who had fought to keep her from being put down. “She was a total knucklehead,” shelter volunteer and dog trainer Patricia Inman had told The Associated Press of Ruby, who had been returned by five families for being too rambunctious before O'Neil adopted the then-eight-month-old in 2011. Ruby earned national recognition for the rescue — the American Humane Hero Dog organization named her the nation’s “Search and Rescue Dog of the Year” — and her story was made into the 2022 Netflix movie “Rescued by Ruby.” “She had a full, happy, and wonderful life, not only as a trooper, but as part of a loving family,” Weaver said. “She worked right until the end and never gave up doing what she loved most — making people smile.” Ruby lived with O’Neil and his family and will be honored privately, police said. “She was given a chance and she’s been doing everything she can to pay it back,” O’Neil said earlier this year. “You have this dog that was given up on, and she’s changed so many people’s lives.” Despite her lauded search-and-rescue career, Ruby's mischievous spirit was irrepressible: Three years ago, she bolted near a state park, turning up safe and sound  after a 19-hour search. More recently, she returned from a bathroom break with a live skunk writhing — and spraying — in her jaws. The antics were part of what made Ruby, well, Ruby. Above all, she was a good dog. “If you show them love and compassion and you give them a certain type of stability, they’ll show their true colors,” O'Neil had said.",U.S./Associated Press,K-9 featured in Netflix's 'Rescued by Ruby' euthanized,https://news.yahoo.com/k-9-featured-netflixs-rescued-164045699.html
5/16/2022,"VALENTYNA ROMANENKO — SUNDAY, 15 MAY 2022, 14: 22 The Russian invaders confirm that they are using phosphorus and cluster weapons in Ukraine, which are prohibited by international conventions. Source: another intercept of the invaders' conversation by the Security Service of Ukraine Details: These are particularly dangerous and inhumane types of weapons. Thus, the Russian Federation continues to grossly violate the laws and customs of war, in order to destroy as many peaceful Ukrainians as possible. Since 2014, the Security Service of Ukraine has repeatedly recorded the use of prohibited weapons by Russian occupiers in the area of the Anti-Terrorist Operation Zone/Joint Forces Operation. Since the beginning of the large-scale invasion, these war crimes have been committed by the occupiers along the entire front line. The Security Service of Ukraine documents each of them. The intercepts and the collected data will be included in the materials for the international courts, so that no Russian war criminal escapes punishment, the intelligence service notes. Quote from the occupier: ""Yes, they are still waiting for Volodka (Putin -ed.). To get all this f*cked up, he will withdraw the troops and f*cking fire ""Topols"" here. And so, you see, everything that was forbidden by international conventions: cluster bombs, phosphorus – we were allowed everything, we let everything go there.""",World/Ukrayinska Pravda,Russians confirm they are hitting Ukrainian targets with banned cluster and phosphorus weapons Security Service of Ukraine,https://news.yahoo.com/russians-confirm-hitting-ukrainian-targets-112214181.html
5/16/2022,"Wayne Jones told Insider his mother was one of the Buffalo supermarket mass shooting victims. Jones said he and his mother, 65-year-old Celestine ""Stiney"" Chaney, usually went to the store together. He said he learned about her death from a screenshot of the gunman's live stream. Wayne Jones made a point to join his 65-year-old mother on trips to the supermarket in Buffalo, New York. The one time he couldn't make it, the unthinkable happened. Jones's mother, Celestine ""Stiney"" Chaney, was among 10 victims who were killed during a mass shooting at Tops Friendly Market in Buffalo on Saturday. Jones had stayed home in recovery from knee surgery while his mother and aunt went to the grocery store to buy Chaney's favorite strawberry shortcakes when the incident happened. ""We went grocery shopping, that was what we did. As she got older, I'd take her grocery shopping,"" he told Insider. ""It's ironic that the one time we didn't go together, there's a tragedy."" Jones said Chaney and his aunt were initially together when the shooting began, but ""got split up"" in the commotion. ""My aunt got in the freezer. She looked behind her and didn't see (my mother),"" Jones said. ""Just a short little store run, and you lose your life because you wanted to just go to the store,"" he added. Authorities identified the accused white gunman as 18-year-old Payton Gendron of Conklin, New York. According to officials, the suspect traveled hours to reach the predominantly Black community before opening fire on people inside the supermarket. Thirteen people were shot in total, and 10 people died, including Chaney. A majority of the victims were Black. Officials called the shooting ""racially motivated"" and noted the gunman live-streamed the incident on Twitch. The suspect, wearing tactical gear, filmed the shooting using a camera connected to his helmet, authorities said. Like other families, Jones told Insider that he learned about his mother's death after his daughter sent him a screenshot from the video to confirm her identity. ""She inboxed me the picture, and it was mom, lying there, with the barrel of the gun over her,"" Jones told Insider. ""It was because he live-streamed the whole video … I don't want to see that. I've already seen the pictures. There's enough pain right now. Just watching that, seeing the damage over and over again, I don't think that's good."" In a statement, Twitch said the armed suspect was ""indefinitely suspended"" from the platform and said the company is ""taking all appropriate action, including monitoring for any accounts rebroadcasting this content."" The suspect was arrested at the scene and charged with first-degree murder, to which he pleaded not guilty. Law enforcement said they were investigating a manifesto that appears to have belonged to the accused shooter and contained plans to kill Black people. It also referenced the replacement theory, a white-supremacist conspiracy theory that believes people of color will outnumber white people. The manifesto also reportedly stated that the supermarket was targeted due to the high percentage of Black shoppers and residents in the community, Insider's Kelsey Vlamis reported. According to reports, the suspect's semi-automatic weapon had the N-word painted on it and the number 14, a white supremacist slogan. Officials say that they are investigating the incident as both a hate crime and ""racially motivated violent extremism."" ""It's crazy because you would never think this would happen to you. Like, I've never dreamed of nothing like this,"" Jones said. ""I've thought about different situations … but never would I think a white supremacist would find the only Black Tops in your state at the time that my mom was there. You can't dream this."" Jones said he is trying to stay resilient for his children as they try to get through this difficult time. ""My mother, she's got six grandkids. I've got to make sure I'm strong enough to handle that part. I have to be strong for them. I have to be. I have to make sure they maintain their sanity through all of this,"" he said.

5/16/2022,"(Reuters) - Russia on Saturday dismissed Ukraine's claim it had damaged a modern navy logistics ship in the Black Sea and showed photos of what it said was the vessel with no signs of damage. Military authorities in the southern Odesa region said on Thursday that Ukrainian naval forces had struck the Vsevolod Bobrov, setting it alight. In an online post, the Russian defence ministry published photos it said had been taken of the ship on Saturday in the Crimean Black Sea port of Sevastopol. ""It is now clear from the photographs that the ship is not damaged at all,"" it said. Last month the missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, sunk after catching fire. Ukraine said it hit the ship with a missile fired from the coast while Moscow blamed an ammunition explosion.
