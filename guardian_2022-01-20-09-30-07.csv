1/20/2022,"Antimicrobial resistance poses a significant threat to humanity, health leaders have warned, as a study reveals it has become a leading cause of death worldwide and is killing about 3,500 people every day. More than 1.2 million – and potentially millions more – died in 2019 as a direct result of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections, according to the most comprehensive estimate to date of the global impact of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).The stark analysis covering more than 200 countries and territories was published in the Lancet. It says AMR is killing more people than HIV/Aids or malaria. Many hundreds of thousands of deaths are occurring due to common, previously treatable infections, the study says, because bacteria that cause them have become resistant to treatment.  “These new data reveal the true scale of antimicrobial resistance worldwide, and are a clear signal that we must act now to combat the threat,” said the report’s co-author Prof Chris Murray, of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. “We need to leverage this data to course-correct action and drive innovation if we want to stay ahead in the race against antimicrobial resistance.” Previous estimates of the health impact of AMR have been published for several countries and regions, and for a small number of pathogen-drug combinations in a wider range of locations. However, until now no estimates have covered all locations or a broad range of pathogens and drug combinations. The new Global Research on Antimicrobial Resistance (Gram) report estimates deaths linked to 23 pathogens and 88 pathogen-drug combinations across 204 countries and territories in 2019. Statistical modelling was used to produce estimates of the impact of AMR in all locations – including those with no data – using more than 470m individual records obtained from systematic literature reviews, hospital systems, surveillance systems, and other data sources. The analysis shows AMR was directly responsible for an estimated 1.27million deaths worldwide, and associated with an estimated 4.95 million deaths, in 2019. HIV/Aids and malaria have been estimated to have caused 860,000 and 640,000 deaths, respectively, in 2019. While AMR poses a threat to people of all ages, young children were found to be at particularly high risk, with one in five deaths attributable to AMR occurring in children under the age of five. The report highlights an urgent need to scale up action to combat AMR, and outlines immediate actions for policymakers that would help save lives and protect health systems. These include optimising the use of existing antibiotics, taking greater action to monitor and control infections, and providing more funding to develop new antibiotics and treatments. The UK’s special envoy on antimicrobial resistance, Dame Sally Davies, said AMR was “one of the greatest challenges facing humanity”. She added: “Behind these new numbers are families and communities who are tragically bearing the brunt of the silent AMR pandemic. We must use this data as a warning signal to spur on action at every level.” Regionally, deaths caused directly by AMR were estimated to be highest in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, at 24 deaths per 100,000 population and 22 deaths per 100,000 population respectively. In high-income countries, AMR led directly to 13 deaths per 100,000 and was associated with 56 deaths per 100,000. In the western Europe region, which includes the UK, more than 51,000 people died as a direct result of AMR. Other experts said Covid-19 had demonstrated the importance of global commitments to infection and control measures, such as hand-washing and surveillance, and rapid investments in treatments. Tim Jinks, the head of the drug-resistant infections programme at Wellcome Trust, said: “The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of global collaboration: political leaders, the healthcare community, the private sector and the public working together to tackle a global health threat. “Like Covid-19, we know what needs to be done to address AMR, but we must now come together with a sense of urgency and global solidarity if we are to be successful.”",News/Society,"Antimicrobial resistance now a leading cause of death worldwide, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/20/antimicrobial-resistance-antibiotic-resistant-bacterial-infections-deaths-lancet-study
1/20/2022,"Researchers have claimed that more than two-thirds of male football fans harbour hostile, sexist or misogynistic attitudes towards women’s sport. A study led by Durham University, based on a survey of almost 2,000 male football supporters, detected what it terms “openly misogynistic masculinities”, irrespective of age.  Although progressive opinions among men were strongly represented they were not as common as hostility and sexism and the researchers suggest this indicates a backlash in advances in gender equality. The study was set in the context of increased visibility of women’s sport in recent years, most notably since the 2012 London Olympics and the 2015 Women’s World Cup in Canada, where England secured a bronze medal. Dr Stacey Pope, an associate professor from Durham University’s department of sport and exercise sciences, was the lead author, with her team assisted by researchers from the Universities of Leicester and South Australia. Their analysis was based on the responses of 1,950 male football supporters who regularly use UK-based fan message boards. “This is the first study to examine UK men football fans’ attitudes to women’s sport in an era in which women’s sport has experienced a significantly increased media profile,” said Pope. “Our research showed that attitudes towards women in sport are, to some extent, changing, with more progressive attitudes. However, the findings are also reflective of a patriarchal society in which misogyny is rife. There were numerous examples of men from across all generations exhibiting highly sexist and misogynistic attitudes.” A sub-group of 507 respondents who answered particular questions were divided into three categories: those displaying progressive views, others harbouring overtly misogynistic attitudes and covert misogynists. The first band of 24% expressed strong support for equal media coverage of women’s sport, with many saying the 2015 Women’s World Cup had represented a watershed. Yet some of the overt group – 68% of those polled – suggested women should not participate in sport at all, or, if they did, would be better suited to more “feminine” pursuits such as athletics, rather than football. Media reporting of women’s sports – a sphere regarded as intrinsically inferior – was seen as “positive discrimination” or “PC nonsense”. The 8% of fans branded covertly hostile comprised the smallest group. They typically expressed progressive attitudes in public before revealing more reactionary private opinions. The co-author John Williams, from Leicester University, said: “The increase in media coverage of women’s sport was openly supported by some men. But it also clearly represents, for others, a visible threat. “This is at a time when there are more widespread anxieties circulating among men about how to establish and perform satisfying masculine identities. For men like these, there was a pronounced anti-feminist backlash.”",Sport/Football,"Misogyny towards women’s sport common among male football fans, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/20/misogyny-towards-womens-sport-common-among-male-football-fans-study-finds
1/20/2022,"The Covid pandemic has inspired record numbers of people to become nurses, with more than 56,000 signing up to nursing courses or apprenticeships in England since the outbreak in early 2020, according to a report. Figures from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) show that more 18-year-old school leavers are applying for and accepting places to study nursing than before the pandemic, with applications up by 38% since 2019, while applications from those over the age of 21 have also risen by more than a third.  The report by Ucas and Health Education England found that 69% of recent applicants said the Covid pandemic had inspired them to apply to become a nurse, with around one in 10 saying the pandemic was the most important factor in their decision. One in four applicants said the current high profile of healthcare workers was a significant influence on their decision. Ruth May, the chief nursing officer for NHS England, said she was thrilled by the record number of applications. “The last couple of years, difficult as they have been, have shone a spotlight on the value of our nursing profession and the rewarding careers on offer in every corner of the NHS,” she said. Clare Marchant, the chief executive of Ucas, said she expected that the increased demand for places on nursing courses would continue before next week’s deadline for applications to courses starting in autumn. “It is heartening to see that one of the positive legacies of the work of our incredible healthcare workers during the pandemic is that more of our young people have been inspired to enter the nursing profession, particularly when they are arguably the ones who have been most affected, both in terms of their education and way of life,” Marchant said. Nursing is now the fifth most popular subject studied at higher education in England, having recovered from a fall in applications that followed the government’s removal of bursary funding in 2017. In 2021, 25,000 students were accepted on to nursing programmes. The report also identified nursing careers as boosting social mobility in the UK, with nursing alongside education and health and social care courses as the only subjects where more young people from the most disadvantaged areas choose to study nursing than their most advantaged counterparts. But the report also showed a continuing gender gap in the profession, with women nine times more likely to choose and be placed on nursing courses than men.",News/Education,Covid driving record numbers in England to become nurses,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/20/covid-driving-record-numbers-in-england-to-become-nurses
1/20/2022,"With 62 minutes gone at the Brentford Community Stadium something startling happened. Ralf Rangnick’s Manchester United – this collection of jumbled limbs, soldered and bolted together on its gurney – sprung unexpectedly to its feet, arms raised towards the light.  United were already 1-0 up at the time. The first half had belonged to Brentford, United producing periods of slow possession interspersed with spasms of intensity where the players seemed to be trying to execute the Rangnick press and pass, but dished up instead a flurry of disconnected energy, like a pigeon trapped in the eaves. At which point the players in custard yellow shorts produced the single most Ralf Rangnick moment of this temp-to-perm Ralf Rangnick reign. It was a lovely goal, and best of all it came straight from the playbook of swift turnovers and direct running. Scott McTominay won the ball in United’s half and played an instant forward pass. Cristiano Ronaldo conjured a swivelling chest-nudge into the run of Bruno Fernandes, haring straight at goal, with only green in front of him. To his right Mason Greenwood was already veering inside the cover to take Fernandes’ pass and finish before sprinting off to the away section: the end point of a move that took four seconds and three passes to travel 60 metres, finished by two players sprinting side by side like the medallists in the world indoor 60m championship. In that moment it did feel like a flicker of something. What does Rangnick want? He wants youth, energy and constant running. He hates complacency, resistance to change, the feeling of being stuck. Welcome, Ralf, to the museum of the recent past, haunted by ghosts, glories, brand-power. And true to form the week had been dominated by a new theme, the idea of dressing room rot, of a culture gone bad, sickly, fish-grey, curdled. Wanting it. Having it. Desire. Hunger. Are we really here, back at the atomic level, down in the mud of basic human stuff, like, do you actually want to do this at all? It is probably unfair to question the basic motivation of these players. What we saw in the opening half-hour here was an inability to execute the plan. Coaching is a strange thing. It’s no use just telling people what you want them to do. Express yourself. Play without fear. Press hard. OK, fine. But how? This is of course Rangnick’s job, and until now it has been a fuzzy connection. Rangnick has talked a lot about “second balls” since he got to England, a strange kind of localised obsession. Do we really want Rangnick to be doing this? We have a hundred English blokes in reserve who can talk about second balls. Shouldn’t he be talking about rotational pressing and third phase possession? But he was right. United didn’t win the second balls, or the first balls, or indeed the third balls early on. Brentford won those duels and might have scored three times with competent finishing. But then, it has been five years now since Thomas Frank turned up in west London, five years of goggle-eyed, weirdly magnetic pass and press energy. This team is in many ways a version of that latest United blueprint. Rangnick fielded a side with an eye on this evolving vision, with a few faces starting to settle and a 19-, 20- and 22-year-old in the starting 11. But early on United were oddly error-prone, strung together in tight rows, but always out of step, like a group of men learning to line dance, turning the wrong way, treading on toes, falling over barstools. The second half brought an abrupt change of tempo, as United came out cranked, revved and ready to go. The first goal came from a moment of fast-forward brilliance from Fred. Taking the ball from Diogo Dalot, he looked up, registered Anthony Elanga’s diagonal run in the edge of his vision and produced an instant clipped pass to intersect with his trajectory. Elanga had time to take a sightly heavy touch, adjust his feet and nod the ball past Jonas Lössl, who seemed surprised in that moment, to look up and find himself keeping goal in a football match. The third goal was another moment of Total Ralf, as McTominay won the ball again, fed it forward again and a swift move ended with Marcus Rashford finishing well. This was another excellent 90 minutes from McTominay, who in this Rangnick version of 4–3-3 is asked to play close together with Fred in a kind of twin-headed midfield ogre, strangling the space, always feeding the ball forward. Rangnick loves players who carry out a plan, who have no ego, who enjoy those collisions, and McTominay is well suited to this. Get it. Go forwards. Snap those passes out. Rangnick could be good for him. And for all the muddle, the luck, the poor Brentford finishing, there was at least a flicker here, a glimpse of that alternative, Ralf-shaped universe.",Sport/Football,Ralf-shaped universe takes shape as Manchester United find togetherness | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/19/ralf-shaped-universe-takes-shape-as-manchester-united-find-togetherness
1/20/2022,"Ralf Rangnick was forced to explain to Cristiano Ronaldo why he was substituted after the forward questioned his decision during Manchester United’s 3-1 win at Brentford that Thomas Frank claimed was “unbelievably lucky”. While the visitors were uneven before the break, they scored three times in the second half, through Anthony Elanga, Mason Greenwood and Marcus Rashford before Ivan Toney got a late goal back for Frank’s side.  Ronaldo was taken off when United were 2-0 up and the 36-year-old was visibly unhappy when sitting next to Rangnick. The interim manager was asked what was said between the two. “He asked:‘Why me, why have you taken me off?’” Rangnick said. “I told him: ‘I have to make decisions in the interests of the team and club. We had the same situation at Aston Villa [on Saturday] when we were 2-0 up in the second half and I didn’t want to make the same mistake [drawing 2-2].’ “So tonight I put on Harry Maguire, went to a back three, and a fast winger, Marcus Rashford. It was the right decision. Cristiano is a goalscorer but it was more important to be compact at this moment. When we scored a third I said this exactly to him: ‘I know you’re ambitious to score but maybe in two years’ time when you are a head coach like me and in the same position you’ll understand.’” Rangnick was asked if he might speak to the striker again about the incident. “I didn’t expect him to hug me after being substituted,” said the 63-year-old. “I have no issues whatsoever with Cristiano. I’ve been here six weeks and never had any issue with him – none whatsoever.” The win took United to 35 points, two behind West Ham in the final Champions League berth, having played a game less, although Spurs and Arsenal are in between. Yet Frank, whose side dominated the first half, stated United were fortunate. “I am unbelievably proud of my team,” he said. “We are the smallest club in the Premier League, Manchester United the biggest: we destroyed them in the first half, they didn’t have a sniff, three huge chances and there could only have been one winner of this game. They are unbelievably lucky. “Our intensity killed them, we showed that in the first half, we played the Brentford way. If you look at the 90 minutes, there could only be one winner – we had six chances in the first half, its a miracle we did not score.”",Sport/Football,Rangnick told Ronaldo he withdrew him ‘in the interests’ of Manchester United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/19/ronaldo-replaced-for-good-of-manchester-united-says-rangnick
