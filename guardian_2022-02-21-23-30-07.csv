2/21/2022,"Talks over a funding settlement for Transport for London will continue until Friday after the government extended emergency finances to allow time for discussion of a new deal. The latest short-term extension comes as ministers and the mayor of London remain at loggerheads over financing the capital’s transport system after the drop in tube journeys hammered revenues.  The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, told the Commons that the government had supported TfL with more than £4.5bn in extraordinary funding settlements and had now offered a fourth agreement, which the mayor, Sadiq Khan, had until Friday to consider. In a written statement, Shapps said: “We have recognised that demand and, therefore, passenger revenue has been volatile, and have responded accordingly, compensating TfL for that revenue loss to ensure services can be maintained.” He added: “The government is committed to supporting London and the transport network on which it depends, balancing that with supporting the national transport network.” However, TfL and Khan have been seeking a long-term settlement which they say is needed to avert decline and keep investment in transport infrastructure, with passenger numbers on the tube still only about 60% of pre-pandemic levels on weekdays. Khan, who has proposed to extend road charges to make up the shortfall, said: “The pandemic is the only reason TfL is facing a financial crisis. I urge the government to engage with TfL and City Hall in good faith so that we can finally agree a fair, long-term funding deal that will protect London’s transport network – for the sake of the capital and the whole country. “London’s economy plays a huge role in the national economy and around 43,000 jobs outside London depend on TfL’s investment.” A TfL spokesperson said talks would continue, adding: “It is essential London receives the sustained long-term government funding that is vital for the coming years if a period of ‘managed decline’ of London’s transport network is to be avoided.” Government sources have indicated they wish Khan to further raise fares and abolish some concessionary tickets for older passengers and children. TfL is looking for guaranteed capital grants for the next three years but has said it will aim for day-to-day sustainability by April 2023. London’s annual £700m operating grant was abolished under agreement by the previous mayor, Boris Johnson, and the Conservative government.

2/21/2022,"How do the banks continue to get away with it? The latest revelations about Credit Suisse provide yet another glimpse into the corrosive nexus of banks, corporations, accountants, lawyers and financial intermediaries that enables the wealthy and political elites to profit from illicit practices. The bank itself is no stranger to predatory practices. Since 2001 it has been fined at least 47 times by the US authorities and paid fines totalling $10.7bn. Since 2010, it has also been fined on at least six occasions by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and paid fines totalling more than £300m. The fines have become just another cost of doing business, and are passed on to customers.  Credit Suisse is not alone. The roll of dishonour shown by the Panama Papers, Paradise Papers, Pandora Papers, HSBC leaks, Luxembourg leaks and others shows that virtually every major bank is involved in predatory practices. All these leaks have provoked a public debate – but have drawn a minimal response from governments. Credit Suisse is authorised by the FCA, and the latest revelations ought to trigger an independent inquiry in its UK operations, especially as the bank is a repeat offender. However, the chances of that happening are low. The UK government is busy promoting deregulation and a culture of entrepreneurialism – and will not wish to highlight the darker side of this. This culture is a major enabling factor in predatory practices. In the City of London, stealing a march on a competitor, at almost any price, to gain a financial advantage is considered to be a skill, while promotion, status and profits are linked with meeting business targets. In such a system any “deal” is acceptable as long as it is profitable. The problem resides more in being caught than engaging in dishonourable or illegal activity. The smart business activity resides in constructing mechanisms through which benefits are derived from suspect activities while escaping any responsibility for their operations. Hence, a lot of attention is paid to building opaque structures and using financial experts to conceal nefarious practices. The UK Treasury has never been keen on investigating the organisational culture of banks, and predatory practices remain institutionalised. The Credit Suisse leak once again shows that there is an elaborate labyrinth of structures in this world that is difficult to penetrate. The state can respond by promoting transparency and accountability, shutting down offending businesses and prosecuting their senior officials. However, the probability of this is low, as the political system has little independence from big business. Political parties are funded by corporate money and rarely bite the hand that funds them. They parade themselves as “business-friendly”. Thus, little attention is paid to cleaning up the banking sector, even though it is routinely implicated in scandals. The threat of bankruptcy and regulatory action can discipline large banks and their executives, but that has largely been eliminated as the state has shown willingness to shower vast amount of moneys on the sector. The 2007-8 crash revealed that the UK banks had engaged in reckless risk-taking and fraudulent practices. The state responded by dutifully handing out £1.1tn of cash and guarantees to bail out ailing banks. They were further propped up by the subsequent injection of £895bn of quantitative easing. Such policies have removed the threat of bankruptcy from major banks and emboldened them to engage in predatory practices. When profits are privatised and losses are socialised, there is little economic incentive to curb nefarious practices. The regulatory environment can check predatory practices but is weak. In 2012, HSBC, a bank registered in the UK, was fined $1.9bn by the US authorities for money-laundering failures. HSBC “accepted responsibility for its criminal conduct and that of its employees”. It escaped prosecution by entering into a deferred prosecution agreement. There was no UK inquiry. A subsequent 2016 US report revealed that the British chancellor, George Osborne, and the financial services regulator intervened seemingly with the aim of protecting HSBC. Despite demands, there has been no ministerial statement to explain this intervention. Perhaps we are beginning a new chapter. Last year, in a first for the FCA, NatWest was convicted for money laundering after it voluntarily pleaded guilty and paid a fine of £264m. This was not followed by prosecutions of any directors, whose remuneration was presumably augmented by profits from such illicit practices. That said, last year NatWest was fined $35m by the US Department of Justice for “spoofing” – a type of market manipulation – and the press release referred to NatWest as “a repeat offender”. This did not prompt an investigation into the bank’s practices in the UK. Overall, with the veneration of entrepreneurial culture and a compliant state, there is little immediate prospect of cleaning up the banking industry.

2/21/2022,"Fuel prices on forecourts hit a record high on Monday, piling further pressure on motorists and businesses and adding to the soaring inflation at the heart of the UK’s cost of living crisis. Petrol reached 149.12p a litre, meaning it would cost £81.95 to fill a 55-litre family car, while diesel also reached a record at 152.6p, making a similar-sized full tank almost £84.  The motorists’ organisation RAC blamed the rise on profiteering by petrol retailers and stubbornly high oil prices caused by tension between Russia and Ukraine. “The relentless rising price of fuel is hurting households up and down the country, furthering the cost of living crisis,” said the RAC fuel spokesperson, Simon Williams. The threat of an invasion of Ukraine by Russia – one of the world’s largest oil producers – has helped drive a rally in the price of the fossil fuel, which was already recovering ground lost to the coronavirus pandemic. A barrel of Brent crude was up 0.6% to $94 (£69) on Monday, helping push fuel prices beyond the record set a week ago. However, the RAC accused big forecourt operators of needlessly inflating prices for motorists. “While the price of oil is still close to $100 a barrel, wholesale fuel prices don’t merit further retailer rises across the board at the pumps,” Williams said. “We realise that smaller retailers who don’t buy fuel as frequently will be hit by higher wholesale costs but the biggest retailers who buy all the time shouldn’t currently be increasing their forecourt prices. We urge them to play fair with drivers at this difficult time. “Tension between Russia and Ukraine is still weighing heavy on the oil price but there is now a glimmer of hope that more oil may come on to the market from Iran due to a possible nuclear agreement with the US to end sanctions.” Increased fuel prices are likely to exacerbate the cost of living crisis, driven by higher energy prices and tax rises. Inflation has reached a 30-year high of 5.5% and has been predicted to reach 8% in April. Higher fuel prices mean tighter finances for motorists but also drive up costs for businesses that rely on transporting goods, potentially leading to further price rises. Jez Lamb, the founder of the Wirral-based craft beer marketplace Beers@No.42, said: “Delivery vans don’t run on fairy dust and we’re being absolutely hammered right now. “As a business that ships throughout the UK, we rely heavily on the courier network, which will inevitably pass on the rising fuel prices in what is termed the ‘fuel surcharge’. The big question is, do we pass that on to our own customers? “Wherever we can, we try to absorb these costs as much as we can but margins are being squeezed everywhere. Something has to give and, unfortunately, smaller businesses, as ever, are the ones to suffer.”",Lifestyle/Money,UK petrol and diesel prices hit record highs amid claims of profiteering,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/21/uk-fuel-prices-record-high-oil-prices
2/21/2022,"Massimiliano Allegri looked like a man clutching at straws as he stared down the lens of a TV camera on Friday night and insisted that the single point his team had collected from a home game against Torino could help them qualify for the Champions League. By Sunday night, his words sounded prophetic. Despite throwing away a lead in the derby, Juventus improved their advantage over fifth-placed Atalanta, reduced the gap to title favourites Inter and did not lose ground to any direct rival. Five out of Serie A’s top six played over the weekend, but none of them managed a win.  Most astonishing was Milan’s draw away to Salernitana. Not for six years has a team at the top of Serie A failed to beat the team in last place. There were 42 points between the sides at kick-off and the result looked like a foregone conclusion when Junior Messias opened the scoring for the Rossoneri in the fifth minute. The player who used to deliver refrigerators for a living exploited a gap in the defence that might genuinely have been wide enough to fit a lorry through. By the 15th minute, Salernitana had also seen Ivan Radovanovic, signed in January to shore up their midfield, exit the game with an apparent ankle injury. And yet, by the 75th, they were 2-1 ahead. Federico Bonazzoli punished Mike Maignan’s over-eager rush off his line with an overhead-kick equaliser, before Milan Juric crashed home a header to put them in front. They could have scored more. Bonazzoli missed an opengoal at 1-1, after stealing the ball from Maignan. It was hard to tell who had been more wasteful: the keeper, who lost possession while trying to dribble out of his own penalty box, or the striker, who could have passed the ball into an empty net but instead attempted a rabona that looped up into the air and gave Alessio Romagnoli time to recover. In the end, Milan were able to salvage a draw, rescued by an Ante Rebic strike from 25 yards. Their manager, Stefano Pioli, said that he and his players were disappointed with the result, which he blamed on “a few technical and positioning errors,” but he also railed against any discussion of the title race. “The situation around Milan is a bit strange,” he said during a post-game interview with Dazn. “Nobody thinks we can win the Scudetto but you lot keep asking us if we believe in the Scudetto.” It was a curious response – how could the team that sits top of the table after 26 games not be considered a contender to win the whole thing? – but perhaps reflective of this season in which no team seems comfortable with the role of frontrunner. Milan’s draw left Inter with a chance to reclaim top spot a day later. Instead, they lost 2-0 to Sassuolo. The Neroverdi have been the ultimate giant-slayers in Serie A this season, having won previously away to Juventus and Milan, as well as drawing against Napoli at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona. Such results only become more eye-catching when you consider that they sit eleventh in the table and started the month getting drubbed 4-0 by a Sampdoria side battling against relegation. At their best, Sassuolo can be scintillating, a dynamic and attacking team with a spine of young domestic talent. The 22-year-old midfielder Davide Frattesi conducts play from the middle of the pitch, while the little-and-large combination of Giacomo Raspadori, also 22, and Gianluca Scamacca, 23, lead the way up front. Inter have been linked with summer moves for Frattesi and Scamacca. Sassuolo’s CEO, Giovanni Carnevali, confirmed in a pre-game interview that the Nerazzurri had been “among the first” to make enquiries. Perhaps they ought to have acted quicker. It was Scamacca who grabbed Sassuolo’s second on Sunday, after Raspadori had opened the scoring. Both goals should have been avoided. The first went straight through the keeper, Samir Handanovic, while Scamacca was unmarked for the second. His initial reluctance to celebrate was interpreted by some as a desire not to antagonise fans of a club he might soon join. He later explained he had simply presumed, with so much space, that he was about to get flagged for offside. Inter’s attempts to find a way back were thwarted by an inspired display from Sassuolo’s goalkeeper, Andrea Consigli. Still, you could hardly accuse the visitors of stealing a result. They almost went 3-0 up before half-time when Domenico Berardi, the grizzled veteran of their attack at 27 years old, bent a shot against the upright. Inter’s defeat meant that Milan, despite drawing with Serie A’s bottom team, finished the weekend with an improved lead at the top. The greatest beneficiaries may yet be third-placed Napoli, who play away to Cagliari on Monday night, and the Nerazzurri can reclaim first if they win their game in hand. That hardly feels like a foregone conclusion, though, for a team who have lost three of their past five across all competitions. There are so many threads to draw out from this weekend’s results, and not enough words here to do it. Has this simply been a tough run of games for Inter or can we now call it a wobble? The midfield looked a mess on Sunday without the suspended Marcelo Brozovic. A lack of sharpness up front cost them dearly against Liverpool, and Lautaro Martínez has scored just once in his last 11 appearances. How much should we even be focusing on them? Sassuolo’s performances against Serie A’s biggest clubs deserve greater acknowledgement. Could Scamacca, Raspadori or Frattesi yet provide a spark for Italy in next month’s World Cup qualifying playoffs? Or indeed Berardi, the first player in Europe’s top five leagues to reach double figures for goals and assists this season? Juventus 1-1 TorinoSalernitana 2-2 MilanRoma 2-2 VeronaSampdoria 2-0 EmpoliUdinese 1-1 LazioInternazionale 0-2 SassuoloVenezia 1-1 GenoaFiorentina 1-0 Atalanta And what of Salernitana? Saturday’s game against Milan was their first under new manager Davide Nicola. Can he rescue them from relegation just as he did Genoa and Torino over the past two years? There is more to be said about the performance of Torino, too, especially Andrea Belotti – scoring in what is likely to be his last Derby della Mole – and their brilliant centre-back Bremer, who suffocated Dusan Vlahovic. He had done the same a month previously, when the striker was still playing for Fiorentina. Speaking of the Viola, we ought to mention their 1-0 win over Atalanta – sealed with a goal from Vlahovic’s replacement, Krzysztof Piatek. His strike allowed Juventus to strengthen their hold on fourth, despite failing to win the derby. Those straws that Allegri was grasping for on Friday turned out to have some grip after all.

2/21/2022,"The revelations that Credit Suisse has been used by crooks, money launderers and corrupt politicians are a public relations crisis for the banking giant. But the Suisse secrets investigation by the Guardian and its reporting partners is only the latest in a string of controversies to beset Switzerland’s second-largest lender.  We take a look at some of the bank’s biggest scandals over the past few decades. Credit Suisse is implicated in helping to store some of the estimated $5bn-$10bn that the Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos and his wife, Imelda, stole from the country during his three terms as president. It later emerged that Credit Suisse opened accounts for the couple under the fake names “William Saunders” and “Jane Ryan”, helping to shield their funds from scrutiny. In 1995, a Zurich court ordered banks, including Credit Suisse, to return $500m of stolen funds to the Philippines. Japanese authorities fined Credit Suisse and revoked its licence over a “shredding party”, at which bankers destroyed evidence related to an investigation into whether it was helping companies conceal their losses. A bank spokesperson said: “Serious lessons have been learned, corrective actions initiated and disciplinary steps completed.” Switzerland’s Federal Banking Commission reprimanded Credit Suisse for accepting about $214m-worth of funds linked to corruption by the Nigerian military dictator Sani Abacha in the 1990s. The lender was criticised for failing to recognise that his two sons were politically exposed. Credit Suisse said it had improved its monitoring procedures and staff who dealt with Abacha’s regime had left the bank. A Credit Suisse banker was arrested for allegedly helping launder at least 5bn yen linked to Japan’s largest yakuza gang. The banker was acquitted on the basis that he was unaware of the source of the funds. Credit Suisse was fined $536m for deliberately circumventing US sanctions against countries including Iran and Sudan between 1995 and 2007. The bank said it had “enhanced” its procedures and was “taking action internally”. Credit Suisse agreed to pay €150m to settle an investigation into tax evasion by about 1,100 of its German clients. “A complex and prolonged legal dispute has been avoided, with an agreed solution that provides legal certainty,” the bank said. US authorities charged four former Credit Suisse bankers with fraudulently overstating the price of $3bn of sub-prime bonds during the 2007 credit crisis. One former managing director, Kareem Serageldin, was the only individual jailed in relation to the US financial crisis. Credit Suisse was fined $2.6bn and pleaded guilty to helping Americans evade taxes for decades in one of the bank’s most explosive scandals to date. The investigation was launched when the former UBS banker Bradley Birkenfeld violated Swiss banking secrecy laws and passed information to US authorities in 2007. A Senate investigation uncovered aggressive tactics used by Swiss banks, with Credit Suisse having recruited clients at high-end events, courted a potential customer with free gold, and even delivered sensitive bank statements hidden in the pages of a Sports Illustrated magazine. Authorities eventually pressured Switzerland into unilaterally disclosing account information about US taxpayers from 2014. Credit Suisse said: “We deeply regret the past misconduct that led to this settlement.” Credit Suisse reached a €109.5m settlement with Italian authorities over allegations it helped clients hide funds and dodge taxes through complex insurance policies, which were reportedly routed through its Liechtenstein and Bermuda subsidiaries. Credit Suisse said it welcomed the deal. A US regulator fined Credit Suisse $16.5m after identifying “significant deficiencies” in the bank’s anti-money-laundering programme. The lender said it was “taking appropriate internal remedial efforts”. Singapore’s financial regulator fined Credit Suisse $700,000 for breaching money-laundering rules in transactions linked to 1MDB, the Malaysian investment fund at the centre of a $4.5bn corruption scandal. Credit Suisse said it took its money-laundering obligations seriously and was “firmly committed to upholding the high standards of the Singapore financial centre”. Authorities raided homes and offices in the Netherlands and France, and launched investigations into Credit Suisse employees in the UK, Germany and Australia, in connection with suspected tax evasion involving 55,000 accounts. Credit Suisse said it was cooperating with authorities and later took out a series of adverts in British newspapers declaring that it “applies a strict zero-tolerance policy” on tax evasion. The Swiss regulator ordered Credit Suisse to improve its anti-money-laundering controls after identifying shortfalls in its dealings with Fifa, the Brazilian oil corporation Petrobras and Venezuelan state oil company, PDVSA. The bank said it took its compliance responsibilities seriously. A former Credit Suisse banker, Patrice Lescaudron, was sentenced to five years in prison after admitting to forging client signatures to divert money and make stock bets without their knowledge, causing more than $150m in losses. His clients included the former Georgian prime minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, who is still trying to recover his funds. Credit Suisse said the relationship manager “was not supported by any other employee of the Credit Suisse in his criminal activities”. Lescaudron killed himself in 2020. Credit Suisse agreed to pay $47m to US authorities over a “corruption scheme” in which it tried to win business by offering jobs to family and friends of Chinese officials between 2007 and 2013. A spokesperson for the bank said it had improved its compliance processes. The bank was caught in a corporate espionage scandal, and eventually admitted to hiring private detectives to track two outgoing executives. It triggered a regulatory investigation and culminated in the departure of its chief executive, Tidjane Thiam, in 2020. A group of executives were later found to have ordered surveillance in a further five cases between 2016 and 2019. Credit Suisse said it had banned surveillance “unless required for compelling reasons, such as threats to the physical safety of employees”. Swiss prosecutors issued an indictment against Credit Suisse for allegedly failing to run proper checks on clients and investigate the source of funds linked to a Bulgarian drug ring that allegedly laundered at least $146m through accounts between 2004 and 2008. The criminal trial, which began in February 2022, is the first against a Swiss bank in the country’s history. Credit Suisse said it would “defend itself vigorously” and “unreservedly rejects as meritless all allegations in this legacy matter raised against it”. Credit Suisse recorded a $5.5bn loss due to its risky exposure to the US hedge fund Archegos Capital Management, which collapsed in early 2021. Credit Suisse said it took action against 23 staff and fired nine, and subsequently promised to put risk management “at the heart” of its decision-making. Credit Suisse was forced to suspend $10bn of investor funds after the collapse of the supply-chain lender Greensill Capital, whose loans were packaged and sold to Credit Suisse clients. The Greensill scandal, which stemmed from risky loans it extended to companies owned by the metals magnate Sanjeev Gupta, spiralled after it emerged the former UK prime minister David Cameron lobbied ministers and government officials on its behalf. The bank is still trying to claw back money for clients and said “actions have been taken against a number of individuals” in relation to the case. Regulators fined Credit Suisse £350m to settle the bank’s role in the long-running Mozambique “tuna bonds” loan bribery scandal that pushed the country into financial crisis from 2016. Credit Suisse was implicated in $50m-worth of kickbacks that a government contractor handed to its bankers in exchange for better terms on nearly $1.3bn-worth of loans arranged for the People’s Republic of Mozambique between 2012 and 2016. The bank said it “condemns any unjustified observations and has already taken decisive steps to strengthen its relevant governance and processes”. The Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren is urging the US labour department to deny Credit Suisse the ability to manage workers’ retirement funds as a result of the bribery settlement. António Horta-Osório resigned as Credit Suisse chairman on 17 January after twice breaking Covid quarantine rules in Switzerland and the UK, including to attend football and tennis matches in London. “I regret that a number of my personal actions have led to difficulties for the bank and compromised my ability to represent the bank internally and externally,” he said. Credit Suisse immediately appointed the board member Axel Lehmann as its chairman. Lehmann was at the helm for only five weeks before the publication of the Suisse secrets leak.

2/21/2022,"Swiss film-maker and former social worker Fred Baillif has created this pressure-cooked realist drama about a group of teen girls in a care home, where there is something more dysfunctional and tragic about the supervising staff than about the inmates themselves. Lora (Claudia Grob) is the director of this residential institution, a tough veteran of the system. Under her wing are troubled girls including Audrey (Anaïs Uldry), Précieuse (Joyce Esther Ndayisenga) and Justine (Charlie Areddy). Each of them is acting out, each has been abused in some way, but they find love and solidarity in this home: for them it is la famille, slangily shortened to la mif, equivalent, perhaps, to “the fam”. But from the very outset, it is Lora herself who is in serious trouble: she is officially reprimanded for allowing a situation to happen whereby one of the girls, at 17, has sex with a 14-year-old boy who has been allowed to visit with others for a party. She incautiously opens up to one of the girls about an unthinkably painful thing in her own life, and when this same girl spitefully throws this information back in Lora’s face during a later row, Lora’s drinking problem begins to resurface; she slaps one of the abusive mothers who insults her, having been unlawfully demanding to see her daughter at the home – and things spiral out of control from there.  Each of the girls is introduced with a different “chapter” style section, and the action repeatedly rewinds to a specific and familiar point, though without any very startling difference or viewpoint-shift revelation. The energy between the girls is something that French cinema can do very well – I thought of Céline Sciamma’s Bande de Filles, but also Sarah Gavron’s Rocks). It is acted largely by nonprofessional newcomers and unscripted scenes have been allowed to unspool through improvisation and shaped in the edit.

2/21/2022,"The classrooms of Kambuzuma high school are deserted, with no staff to be seen and Tanaka Mupasiri*, 16, and his friends are milling around the school yard. It is 9am on a Thursday, normally a time when the school, in a high-density suburb or township on the outskirts of Harare, would be a hive of studious activity but Zimbabwe’s national teachers’ strike has thrown the education system into crisis. Teachers in state schools have not been at work since 7 February and face a government deadline of Tuesday to return or lose their jobs.  For children like Mupasiri, who will be sitting O-level exams this year, the industrial action is further affecting their education after a year of learning already lost due to school closures during Covid. “We come to school and sit; this is all we come to do. Since last week, we thought the situation would get better but it seems to be getting worse,” Mupasiri said. “The O-level syllabus needs time to master but with this strike, I may never learn everything I need to know before my final examinations.” In Zimbabwe, a teacher earns less than $200 (£150) a month using the official exchange rate, and less than $100 at the illegal market exchange rate widely used for goods and services. Teachers are demanding a basic salary of $540 a month and say that the government offer of $100 extra a month is not enough. Last week, the government responded by suspending more than 135,000 teachers without pay for failing to report to work. “All officials within the ministry who absented themselves from duty since the opening of schools on 7 February 2022 have been suspended without pay forthwith for a period of three months,” said Evelyn Ndlovu, Zimbabwe’s schools minister. A high court challenge by the Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (ARTUZ) to stay the suspensions was granted. Only hours later, however, the Public Service Commission announced that teachers must return to class by 22 February; failure to do so would be regarded as a voluntary resignation. “All teachers, deputy heads and heads of schools who do not report for duty by Tuesday 22 February will be deemed to have resigned from service. Those reporting for duty but not teaching will also be deemed to have resigned,” a statement seen by the Guardian read. Raymond Majongwe, president of the Progressive Teachers Union (PTUZ), said: “We are not going to back down on our demands. Even if we assume that teachers go back to work on Tuesday, our demands would not have been met. “The most important thing is that the Public Service Commission is doing something that is not above board. Their instruction is illegal, and we dismiss it with the contempt it deserves.” Hundreds of teachers have already left the public sector to start illegal back-yard schools, where parents who have the money to spare pay for tutoring to get their children through exams. “We are being forced to part with more money to pay for extra lessons because of the strike. Government should get the teachers back to class. The future of children is at stake here if we are not careful,” said one parent. Like many, they worry that children out of school will be caught up in petty crime and drugs, which have seen a big upsurge among young Zimbabweans during the pandemic. Outside Harare’s Kuwadzana high school, Brian Jonasi*, 14, tussles for the football with his friends on a makeshift pitch. “Since last week, we have been coming to school but the teachers do not show up,” Jonasi said. “I am now in form 2 but do not have any idea what our syllabus entails, so there is nothing to read. That is why we are playing football.” *Names of children have been changed",News/Global development,Zimbabwe’s striking teachers told to return to work or lose their jobs,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/21/zimbabwes-striking-teachers-told-to-return-to-work-or-lose-their-jobs
2/21/2022,"First came Storm Dudley, battering Northern Ireland, northern England and southern Scotland. Storm Eunice swiftly followed on Friday, with wind speeds of up to 122mph, causing further destruction. Then, Storm Franklin rolled in overnight on Sunday, causing heavy rain and flooding. Hundreds of people were evacuated from their homes, and more than 150 flood warnings remained in place on Monday in the north of England, with Yorkshire and Manchester among the worst hit.  What happens if the extreme weather damages your property? Buildings insurance policies usually state that they will cover financial loss caused by storm damage. Kelly Whittington, the property and speciality lines claims director at Aviva, said: “Currently, claims mainly relate to missing roof tiles and broken windows. However, we are seeing some more devastating cases such as fallen chimney stacks and trees falling on homes or vehicles. “We have field teams across the UK and they will be concentrating on the worst-affected areas. These teams will be visiting our customers to assist them with their claims over the coming days.” A spokesperson for Direct Line said the company has “significantly increased capacity” on its phone lines to deal with an “understandably high volume of inquiries”. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) said that firms would be prioritising their vulnerable and elderly customers first when dealing with claims. However, companies have been known to argue over what constitutes a storm. Last year Guardian Money dealt with a case where an insurer refused to pay to repair a leaking roof damaged during Storm Christoph. The Financial Ombudsman Service says these type of disputes are among the main complaints it gets about unpaid storm damage claims. The ABI says a storm is a period of violent weather defined as: wind speeds with gusts of at least 48 knots (55mph) – equivalent to 10 on the Beaufort scale or; torrential rainfall at a rate of at least 25mm an hour or; snow to a depth of at least 1ft (30 cm) in 24 hours or; hail of such intensity that it causes damage to hard surfaces or breaks glass. Your insurer may have this definition in its policy or may apply its own rules. If the weather in your area does not meet the criteria, it will turn down your claim. As soon as you can, you need to tell your insurer that your property has been damaged and you want to make a claim. Most insurers have 24-hour helplines and they should be geared up to deal with the fallout from the storm, as forecasters have been talking about it for days. Take photos and keep anything you can in case you need to show the insurer evidence to back up your claim. Speak to the insurer before arranging urgent repairs or somewhere to stay. It may have emergency repair teams to send out but, if not, your policy may cover getting the work done. Tell your insurer that this work needs doing, and make sure you get receipts to submit as you may be able to get the money back from your policy. When it is safe to, inspect your property properly and make a list of all of the damage. Take photos and keep anything you can in case you need to show the insurer evidence to back up your claim. This will depend on your policy. If you have buildings cover, this will pay out for damage to your home – it will cover the cost of replacing items and getting things fixed. It is also likely to cover accommodation costs if you are unable to stay in your property because of the damage. How much it will pay out will depend on the level of cover you have bought, and what excess you chose – this is the sum you pay towards any work. What cover it offers for things such as garden sheds will depend on the individual policy. Your possessions will be covered by contents insurance. You may have included garden furniture and bikes on this policy – if you haven’t, then you won’t be able to claim if these are damaged. Contents cover often offers the option to protect everything in your freezer – if you bought this type of cover and have a power cut, remember to photograph and tot up the cost of everything you have to throw out. You may also be entitled to compensation if your electricity supply goes off. According to Ofgem, what you can claim depends on the following factors: If the cut is planned. How long the cut goes on for. If it was the network company’s fault. Your local network company that maintains supply on the grid is responsible for fixing power cuts and responding to compensation claims. When you can claim relies on how Ofgem categorises storms in severe weather. You are entitled to £70 as a non-domestic or domestic customer if your power goes off for 24 hours under storm category 1, or 48 hours under storm category 2. You can receive a further £70 for each additional 12 hours of being cut off from your supply, up to a total of £700. You will need to contact your energy supplier if you have been cut off for other reasons – such as a faulty energy meter. If you experience a power cut, call 105 for free to be put through to your local network operator for further help and advice. If your car is hit by a tree or debris blowing around, it will be covered if you have a comprehensive insurance policy – as most drivers do. A third-party policy will not cover storm damage. The insurer Zurich says during November’s Storm Arwen claims for this type of damage increased by 17%. However, it said storm-related claims were more often for crashes – during Arwen claims for road traffic accidents were up by 35%. So if you are leaving the house, drive carefully. If your neighbour’s car is damaged by tiles falling from your roof you may be liable – but they will have to show that you are at fault. If your roof was already in a bad state of repair they may be able to claim against you. The legal liability element of your home insurance should cover this.",Lifestyle/Money,Storm Franklin: will your insurance cover damage and how do you claim?,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/21/storm-franklin-insurance-cover-damage-claim-storm-eunice
2/21/2022,"Engineering work delayed the cleaning of rails in Salisbury last October, less than two hours before a passenger train skidded on leaves stuck to the line and crashed, injuring 14, investigators have found. The routine autumn cleaning work had been rescheduled from 5pm to 11pm the same evening but at 6.43pm a South Western Railway train was unable to stop on the slippery tracks and collided with a Great Western Railway service outside a tunnel near Salisbury, Wiltshire.  The collision was the worst between two moving passenger trains in the UK in 20 years, and left 13 passengers hurt and the South Western train driver with life-changing injuries. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) found the planned deployment of a rail head treatment train (RHHT) to tackle leaves on the line was delayed because of nearby engineering work. The track had been cleaned by a RHTT about 32 hours earlier. Network Rail’s RHTTs use water jets or a sand-based gel to clean off the leaves, which can compress to form a slippery film on the rails and pose a danger to trains. Accident inspectors found many areas around the crash site “had a medium or heavy level of contamination”, with black deposits on rails formed by crushed leaves, which were also wet from rain on the day of the crash. Strong winds and heavy rain were also likely factors, they found. In an interim report, the RAIB said that the South Western train was travelling at 86mph, within the speed limit, as it approached a stop signal near the tunnel but when the driver tried to brake, its wheels began to slide almost immediately. It slid for almost 200 metres before hitting the side of the other train at a junction. Inspectors said there was no problem with the signalling system, which was “operating as designed”. As well as the injuries to the 14 people on board, the crash caused major damage to the trains and the railway infrastructure. Services in the area were disrupted for two weeks while repairs were carried out. The RAIB investigation continues and will consider a number of factors, including Network Rail’s policies to manage risk and vegetation around the tracks.",News/UK news,Salisbury train crash: clearance of leaves delayed by engineering work,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/21/salisbury-train-crash-clearance-of-leaves-delayed-by-engineering-work
2/21/2022,"A van driver has admitted killing two young children and seriously injuring their mother in a motorway crash as the family returned from a birthday party. Martin Newman, 41, pleaded guilty to causing the deaths by dangerous driving of Jayden-Lee Lucas, three, and his four-year-old sister, Gracie-Ann Wheaton.  He also admitted seriously injuring their mother, Rhiannon Lucas, in the crash on the M4 at 1.45pm on Saturday 5 February. The family, from Tredegar in Blaenau Gwent, south Wales, had been returning from a birthday party when the car they were travelling in collided with Newman’s Ford Transit on the motorway between junctions 28 and 29 near Newport. Newman, of Croeserw, a village near Port Talbot, spoke only to confirm his identity and enter his guilty pleas during a brief hearing at Cardiff crown court on Monday. Few details of the offence were given and Judge Daniel Williams listed the case for sentence on 8 April. Several of the children’s relatives were in the public gallery, and one person yelled “bastard” as Newman was led from the dock. The two children were taken to the intensive care unit at University hospital of Wales in Cardiff after the crash. Lucas and the children’s father, who has not been named, were also taken to hospital. Gracie-Ann suffered a cardiac arrest due to the severity of her injuries and died the next day at about 5am. Jayden-Lee died the following Friday at 4.30pm. In a tribute to Jayden-Lee, his cousin, Jamie Lucas, 19, said: “He was wonderful, creative and a kind soul. Turned the grey skies blue.” Of Gracie-Ann, he said: “She was so young. She had a bright future ahead of her. She was such a wonderful child. She was very smart, she was very creative. She had a really great imagination as well. She was just fantastic to be around.” A GoFundMe page set up to raise money for the siblings’ funeral has raised more than £14,700. Huw Waythe, the headteacher of Deighton primary school in Tredegar, described them as two “special children”. He said: “Our thoughts remain with members of the family, and words cannot adequately express the shock and pain which they must be feeling. “We are shocked and saddened by the loss of two of our own. We will never forget how special the children were to our school community. “They both put a smile on all our faces daily. They were a delight to have and both always lit up any room with their positive personality and beaming smiles.”",News/UK news,Driver admits killing two children in south Wales motorway crash,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/21/driver-admits-killing-two-children-south-wales-m4-motorway-crash
