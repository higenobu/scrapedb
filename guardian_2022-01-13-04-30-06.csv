1/13/2022,"Boris Johnson’s half-apology on Wednesday, for accidentally attending a party work event in his own garden, was aimed at buying him some time. But it is becoming increasingly clear that his party is running out of patience. Some backbenchers welcomed Johnson’s belated acknowledgement that he should have broken up the booze-fuelled gathering attended by up to 40 staff in the Downing Street garden on 20 May 2020, and suggested he had won himself the right to await Sue Gray’s findings.  As one MP put it: “We want the Sue Gray report – it’s only the decent thing to let her actually do it. We shouldn’t pull the trigger on the guilty verdict until we’ve actually seen the report.” A junior minister agreed, saying Johnson had effectively “bet the farm” on the Gray report. “He’s done enough to win himself another week or two. If Gray doesn’t directly pin the blame on him, it will be framed by No 10 as exoneration,” they said. However, many others, publicly and privately, warned that even before Gray sets out the details of lockdown social events in black and white, Johnson’s authority is draining away. They must now decide whether the damage being done to the Conservative brand is so great that forcing a destabilising no confidence vote now is preferable to allowing him to continue in office. “Tory MPs will be thinking: ‘Before, he was a helium balloon that was lifting the party. Now, he’s an anchor dragging us down,’” said one senior Conservative. The Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross became the first MP to break cover and call for Johnson to go, saying his position was “untenable” after he conceded attending the “bring your own booze” party during lockdown. Ross, who is also an MSP, and his Scottish colleagues have a clear political self-interest in distancing themselves from Johnson, who is anything but popular north of the border. But MPs with English constituencies also publicly ridiculed Johnson’s insistence that he believed the bash described by his own principal private secretary as “socially-distanced drinks” was a “work event”. William Wragg, who sits on the executive of the powerful backbench 1922 Committee, said he and colleagues were “frankly worn out from defending what is invariably indefensible”. Two MPs, including Ross, told the Guardian they had been moved to fire off letters to 1922 Committee chair, Sir Graham Brady, demanding a no-confidence vote which, if Johnson lost, would mark the end of his turbulent premiership. Another said there were “cliques” of MPs gathering, discussing whether to send in a batch of letters, pushing the number closer to the threshold of 54 to trigger a vote. Some fear the drip, drip of revelations about parties is only likely to continue in the coming weeks, making it all but impossible for Johnson to get on with governing. As well as judging whether he should remain prime minister, however, they must also consider the alternatives – and whether they would be capable of restoring Tory fortunes in the polls. It is unclear to say the least whether frontrunners Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak could bind together Johnson’s winning “get Brexit done” coalition of voters in northern “red wall” seats, and more traditional Tories. They may also be reluctant to inherit the crown ahead of what is likely to be a rocky period, with inflation running above 5%, fuel bills rocketing and the Tories primed to lose a swath of seats in May’s local council elections. That may stay the hand of some of their supporters in penning letters to Brady. Some cabinet ministers loyally tweeted their support on Wednesday – but their backing appeared almost as carefully worded as Johnson’s Commons statement, with Sajid Javid, for example, saying Johnson was right to apologise, and “I completely understand why people feel let down”. Meanwhile, Johnson’s plan now appears to be to await the Gray inquiry report in the hope it gives him just enough wriggle-room to continue to claim he was not aware that Covid guidance was being broken. With some officials – including his principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, the party invitation-sender, and director of communications, Jack Doyle – likely to have to go, he could then announce the major shakeup of his team MPs have been calling for since before Christmas. “Why throw bodies overboard when you can use them as human shields?” said one senior Tory. As the Omicron wave hopefully wanes, Johnson could then attempt the last resort of every embattled prime minister – a relaunch, shifting the narrative to what he claims is his government’s mission of “levelling up”. But as a dramatic day in Westminster drew to a close, it was very unclear whether his own backbenchers are willing to give him that opportunity.",News/Politics,PM’s authority draining away as he bets farm on Sue Gray report,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/12/pms-authority-draining-away-as-he-bets-farm-on-sue-gray-report
1/13/2022,"English clubs due to play in France this weekend have given conflicting messages over fulfilling their fixtures but European rugby chiefs were on Wednesday night cautiously optimistic the matches will go ahead as planned. Newcastle, Sale and Bath are all due to play in France this weekend but have expressed grave concerns over what they consider to be prohibitive travel restrictions. They would need to isolate for 48 hours on arrival and produce a negative test before leaving quarantine, raising the prospect of players or staff being stranded for 10 days.  Organisers of the Champions and Challenge Cups have been working with the Ligue Nationale de Rugby in the hope of gaining confirmation that the French government’s rules would be relaxed in time for the three fixtures to take place. Even though confirmation still had not arrived Sale expressed confidence their match at Clermont would go ahead on Sunday, Bath were adamant they would not travel to La Rochelle on Saturday without the requisite guarantees. Newcastle, meanwhile, are planning for Friday’s match at Biarritz to go ahead and will travel on the morning of the match unless told otherwise. Despite the confusion, Sale’s confidence does chime with that of European Professional Club Rugby. They are due to travel on Saturday, returning on Sunday and their director of rugby, Alex Sanderson, struck a positive tone, revealing his South African players are also set to be granted the necessary visas to enter France. “We’re going, that’s what I’ve been informed,” said Sanderson. “The message this morning is that we’re going. My understanding is we don’t have to stay the 48 hours or PCR test which was the risk, because people would probably get trapped in France. We might still need a queen’s seal but all the indications are that it’s happening.” Bath’s director of rugby, Stuart Hooper, was more circumspect, insisting that if the 48-hour isolation period remains in place, his side will be staying put, mindful of how Munster, the Scarlets and Cardiff Blues were all recently stuck in South Africa. “For us it’s more about the testing in country. If you have to isolate for 48 hours it’s because you have to test out of it, or stay isolating for 10 days,” Hooper said. “That’s absolutely not a condition by which we’d travel to France, as you can be stuck there. We still don’t have absolute clarity on what we have to do. We hope to hear very soon about what’s required. I know EPCR are working hard on it.” Ultimately, the key issue appears to be when, rather than if, the French government announces a relaxation of its travel restrictions with the UK. Already the English clubs have been granted an exemption to travel to France as they are deemed to be “in pursuit of economic activity” and it has been widely reported that the restrictions are set to be relaxed further. It is unclear whether the necessary changes will come into force in time for this weekend’s fixtures, however. Meanwhile, Manu Tuilagi is expected to seek release from England’s pre-Six Nations training camp in Brighton in order to prove his fitness with Sale just six days before the competition starts. Eddie Jones is set to name his squad for the Six Nations next Tuesday and England will convene on 24 January on the south coast. But Tuilagi, who has not appeared since sustaining a hamstring injury against South Africa in November, wants to prove his fitness against his old club Leicester later that week. “I need to speak to Eddie about this,” said Sanderson. “Eddie has first got to release him to play that game and I know [Manu] doesn’t want to go in without playing that game. I spoke to him today in the corridor and he said we’ll see how I feel after that game. Eddie is another person who said, look we’re going to manage him through this mentally and physically. He’s got to be right, feel like he’s right and that’ll be the discussion after that Leicester match.”",Sport/Sport,English clubs still uncertain over viability of fixtures in France,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/12/english-clubs-still-uncertain-over-viability-of-fixtures-in-france
1/13/2022,"A high court judge’s ruling that the operation of a “VIP lane” for suppliers of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the coronavirus pandemic was illegal is the culmination of a fight for transparency dating from the early months of the pandemic. As a slew of companies with links to senior Tories secured large contracts to supply PPE in the early months of the pandemic, alarm bells began ringing among transparency activists and senior figures in the Labour party, who accused the government of cronyism.  Jolyon Maugham, founder of Good Law Project (GLP), which, with EveryDoctor, brought the successful legal challenge to the government’s high priority lane, said his interest was piqued when, in May 2020, the government entered into a £108m PPE contract with PestFix, primarily a pest control business, with net assets of £18,000 at the time according to its accounts. As a consequence, he said GLP began to monitor the award of such contracts on the government’s website and “what we saw alarmed us”. Another contract was signed with Ayanda Capital, a London-based investment firm, whose contract, along with PestFix, was challenged by GLP. Maugham said one of the GLP lawyers spotted a tweet from Andrew Mills, an adviser to the international trade secretary (then Liz Truss), saying he was a senior board adviser to Ayanda, leading them to begin to join the dots “that there were political connections”. Explaining how GLP, previously best known for its Brexit cases, challenging the prorogation of parliament and the government’s right to trigger article 50 without parliamentary approval, became involved, Maugham, a tax barrister and QC, said: “We were very interested in pandemic governance. You don’t need to be a lawyer to know that in times of national crisis, stuff needs to happen quickly and when stuff happens quickly there is, for perfectly understandable reasons, an enhanced prospect of it happening badly. But you’re interested in whether government is acting in ways that minimise misconduct, or – as with the VIP lane – institutionalises misconduct.” Separately from the GLP, news organisations, including the Guardian, published articles about a host of contracts made directly with companies associated with Tories without tender, and not relating only to PPE. In May 2020, the Guardian revealed that the healthcare firm Randox, which employed the then Conservative politician Owen Paterson as a paid consultant, had been awarded a £133m contract to produce testing kits. The same month, the Guardian disclosed that state contracts worth more than £1bn had been awarded to private companies dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, without offering other firms the chance to bid. Details of another contract were exposed by the Guardian in July of the same year – an £840,000 contract to research public opinion about government policies awarded to Public First, owned by two long-term associates of Michael Gove and Dominic Cummings, without putting the work out for tender. Maugham said he sought legal advice on whether it would be possible to challenge some of the contracts but was told it would be very difficult. That changed in October 2020 when internal government documents were leaked to the GLP showing the existence of the hitherto secret VIP lane. Nevertheless, Maugham said he initially struggled to get the press to publish details, because “it was so startling a disclosure that nobody would cover it. No one could quite believe what they were seeing.” The next month, the government spending watchdog, the National Audit Office (NAO), confirmed the existence of the channel, saying 493 suppliers had been referred to the scheme by a political or official contact. It said more than half (£10.5bn) of contracts relating to the pandemic up to that date had been awarded without competitive tender and companies in the VIP lane were 10 times more likely to land a contract that those outside it. With details of the scheme exposed, suddenly GLP’s prospects of a successful legal challenge improved, culminating in the judge’s ruling on Wednesday that the VIP lane was unlawful, although Mrs Justice O’Farrell concluded that even without it, PestFix and Ayanda would most likely have been awarded contracts. Maugham said the VIP lane “delivered preferential treatment to those placed on it predominantly by ministers and ministers’ offices. It was institutionalised favouritism”. He would now like to see a more thorough investigation, and cited another NAO report, published last year, which said: “The government counter-fraud function has assessed a high risk of fraud in the procurement of PPE.”",News/World news,‘What we saw alarmed us’: the long fight to expose ‘VIP lane’ Covid contracts,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/12/what-we-saw-alarmed-us-the-long-fight-to-expose-vip-lane-covid-contracts
1/13/2022,"Once again the country finds itself paralysed by a crisis in the Conservative party. Tory MPs took a gamble on Boris Johnson’s personality in order to gain the benefit of his Brexit credentials. In 2019, Mr Johnson did lead his party to victory in the general election. But that bet has not paid off subsequently because of who he is: an incompetent rogue, disloyal to almost everyone but himself. His government has stumbled from crisis to crisis in recent months, wrecking its authority. Mr Johnson deals with scandals by hunkering down and waiting for the storm to blow itself out. That is the approach he adopted on Wednesday. After weeks of dodging questions, Mr Johnson offered an apology – and a defence – for spending 25 minutes at a boozy evening event in May 2020 for dozens of people in the Downing Street garden in breach of the law during the first Covid lockdown.  However, the Tory leader used lawyerly phrasing to imply that he had, at the time, considered this to be work. This was not a plausible rebuttal, and will not wash with the public. Voters will surely only think that Mr Johnson was at an illegal No 10 garden party when their loved ones were dying alone in hospitals. The lockdown regulations were in place to protect the public and squash the spread of the virus in an unvaccinated population. There could not have been one rule for the public and another for the prime minister. However, voters have no immediate opportunity to evict Mr Johnson from Downing Street. If the prime minister’s apology is genuine, he should accept he broke the law. He almost certainly lied to parliament and deceived voters for weeks. There has to be a price. Labour and the Lib Dems have called for him to go. Mr Johnson is not someone given to resigning. The police could issue a fine. That would be a resigning matter for a prime minister. If Mr Johnson were secure in his job he might shrug it off. But he isn’t. Instead, the prime minister sought shelter behind the investigation by Sue Gray, a senior Cabinet Office official. This is perhaps because Ms Gray is unlikely to rule on Mr Johnson’s defence – that he “thought” the people drinking in No 10’s garden were at a work event. It is more likely that Ms Gray resigns because she thought Mr Johnson was not taking her inquiry seriously than the prime minister departs because of its findings. Mr Johnson can be turfed out of office by Tory MPs – and it is they who need an acceptable explanation for May 2020 to appease angry voters. The odds that Conservative backbenchers change their leader shorten as those of their re-election lengthen. While 15% of the parliamentary party could trigger a no-confidence vote in Mr Johnson, he will be safe – for 12 months – if he has 180 MPs backing him. Many are in open revolt. A few hours after his statement, Douglas Ross, leader of Scottish Conservatives, called for Mr Johnson to resign. A senior backbencher, William Wragg, followed suit. The irony is that Mr Johnson was elected to put an end to an era of political chaos that began with the 2016 referendum on EU membership. However, his shortcomings have ensured Tory rebellions will become part of political life. Factions now vie for party supremacy against a backdrop of post-pandemic rows over net zero and Brexit. Mr Johnson no doubt hopes to fight May’s local elections as Tory leader. But it is now clear that the prime minister grievously betrayed the trust of the nation at a time of national crisis. If he stays in Downing Street, it will only intensify the divisions in Britain over how to run the economy and manage the country.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Boris Johnson’s apologetic defence: so begins an era of political chaos | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/12/the-guardian-view-of-boris-johnsons-apologetic-defence-so-begins-an-era-of-political-chaos
1/13/2022,"One of the architects of the UK’s updated sanctions legislation has called for the government and crime agencies to target the wealth of the Kazakhstani elite following the deaths of at least 164 people during unrest. Bill Browder, an American investor turned campaigner, said the British government could use anti-corruption legislation to target the rulers of Kazakhstan on the grounds of human rights abuses.  “It could be imposed on Kazakhstan very easily, and it should be used much more broadly than it is currently being used,” he told British MPs on Wednesday. A report published last month by the thinktank Chatham House identified 34 UK properties bought by the Kazakh ruling elite from 1998 to 2002 at a cost of about £530m. Pressure is building on the government to use the tools at its disposal, including sanctions, property ownership registers and legal action to curb flows of money from Kazakhstan and other autocratic regimes. Protests over fuel prices in Kazakhstan developed last week into armed battles for control of vital infrastructure such as the airport in Almaty, the financial capital. The protests sparked a violent crackdown as well as external military intervention backed by Russia. Browder was speaking at an event held remotely by MPs on the all-party parliamentary group on anti-corruption and responsible tax alongside MPs including Labour’s Dame Margaret Hodge and the Conservatives’ Andrew Mitchell. All three played a large role in the UK’s introduction of legislation in 2017 giving crime agencies the power to target unexplained wealth. Browder was also instrumental in ensuring gross human rights violations were included in the offences covered by the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018. The legislation was inspired by Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer and colleague of Browder who was killed in a Moscow prison after exposing an alleged fraud involving Kremlin officials. Both Hodge and Browder criticised the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA), saying it has not done enough to target the illicit wealth of dictators and kleptocrats, or their families. The NCA’s approach was “lazy”, going after easy prosecutions rather than bigger targets, Browder said. An NCA spokesperson strongly denied this was the case. Hodge said the UK was failing to pursue sanctions against members of the Kazakh elite in part because of the NCA’s failure in 2020 to freeze the assets of the daughter and grandson of a former president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev. Nazarbayev officially stepped down in 2019, but he is widely seen to wield significant influence over the Kazakh government, although that could change following the unrest. On the failure to issue sanctions against Kazakh leaders, Hodge said: “I think they’re running scared because they lost the unexplained wealth order but of course they should use the sanctions regime against them. It’s outrageous.” MPs and campaigners have called for increased funding of crime agencies as well as other measures such as proper checks by the UK’s Companies House register and a register of beneficial ownership of property. Hodge told the Guardian that the UK’s efforts to prevent kleptocrats stashing wealth in the UK could fund themselves if the NCA were allowed to “take a slice of frozen assets to cover their costs”. She also said there should be a cost cap for agencies when prosecuting deep-pocketed wrongdoers in court. The NCA spokesperson said: “Tackling the flow of illicit finance into the UK is a top priority for the National Crime Agency. We will continue to use all the legislation at our disposal to pursue suspected illicit finance, and bring all the capabilities of UK law enforcement to bear against serious criminals and corrupt elites.”",News/Business,Leading campaigner urges UK to target wealth of Kazakhstani elite,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/12/leading-campaigner-urges-uk-to-target-wealth-of-kazakhstani-elite
1/13/2022,"For LGBT+ Christians, 2021 provided two significant causes for celebration. In June, the Methodist church became the largest religious denomination in the UK to allow same-sex marriage. Soon after, the Anglican Church in Wales voted to introduce special blessings for same-sex married couples. Across the border in England, the bishop of Liverpool, the Right Rev Paul Bayes, hailed the Welsh move, saying: “I trust that my own church will follow this creative and gospel-inspired lead, and I hope that this will happen soon.” After more than a decade of bitter deadlock and hurtful division in the Church of England, there is a chance that this will be the year progress is made towards answering Bishop Bayes’ prayers. In April, a church-wide consultation on sexuality will come to an end, with its findings due to be published in the autumn under the title Listening to the Whole Church. The intention, according to the bishop of London, the Right Rev Sarah Mullally, is to find “a way forward for the church in relation to human identity, sexuality, relationships and marriage”. A commitment has been made to establishing a clear direction of travel at a General Synod in February 2023.  This moment of reckoning was intended to come earlier, but the pandemic intervened. Opting to follow in the footsteps of Wales and Scotland (where the Episcopal Church allowed same-sex marriage back in 2017) would begin a healing process, after what the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has described as the “hurt and unnecessary suffering” caused to LGBT+ Christians by a protracted, tortured debate. Many believers have been made to feel like second-class members of the church. It is an absurdity that gay and lesbian English Anglicans should be obliged to travel to Cardiff or Edinburgh for a church blessing or wedding, and the requirement that gay Anglican clergy remain celibate in relationships has blighted lives and fostered an un-Christian culture of suspicion and surveillance. As senior clergy have argued, the church’s rigid stance on same-sex relationships is undermining its outreach efforts, particularly in relation to the young. Theological conservatives have argued that any change to traditional teaching on sexuality should be approved by the worldwide Anglican Communion, which has 85 million members. Given the strong opposition of almost all African Anglican churches to wider LGBT+ rights, this would in effect ensure the preservation of the status quo in perpetuity. But within the Communion, each national church is independent. As Bishop Mullally has clarified, the way forward “is a Church of England decision”. When the time comes to make that decision early next year, it will need to be taken in an atmosphere of mutual respect and compromise. The Church in Wales has agreed a “conscience clause” allowing individual clergy members to opt out of offering blessings to same-sex couples. But as the Church of England seeks to renew itself in the context of declining congregations, it should be bold in reading the signs of the times rather than rely on narrow readings of scripture. The gospels convey a message of loving inclusivity; England’s established church should reflect that.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on same-sex weddings in church: the zeitgeist is moving | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/12/the-guardian-view-on-same-sex-weddings-in-church-the-zeitgeist-is-moving
1/13/2022,"On the streets of Uxbridge and South Ruislip, where Boris Johnson has been MP since 2015, people expressed “disappointment” and called for the prime minister to face a police investigation and penalties for breaking lockdown rules. But should he quit? Not a chance. While most voters who spoke to the Guardian in the west London constituency expressed frustration and anger with actions they perceived as unfair, some regular Conservative voters said they would remain loyal to the prime minister, and others were sceptical about the alternatives.  Stuart Horace, a 57-year-old IT professional, was dissatisfied with Johnson’s apology for attending a No 10 garden party on 20 May 2020 and thought he should pay the same fine as a member of the public caught breaching Covid rules, as should his principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, whom he felt was most to blame given that he sent the invitation to about 100 staff. However, he did not consider the issue a deal-breaker for Johnson’s premiership, and said that he would vote for him again, since “many people” held illegal drinks parties during lockdown. He said: “Tony Blair sent the country to an illegal war for which we’re still picking up the bill, while Boris Johnson went to an illegal gathering with booze. Did Tony Blair resign?” Hayley Babb, a 36-year-old photography student, said she thought the apology was “another Boris cop-out” and that he would use the pandemic to deflect attention away from the possible breach of rules. “It’s do as I say, not as I do,” she said. She wanted to see him face a police investigation but thought this was unlikely to result in his resignation because he has “brass balls” and escaped earlier scandals unscathed. There was nobody she would especially want to take over, she added, since they are “all corrupt” and tend to come from wealthy backgrounds with a limited understanding of working-class people. Kevin Gibson, a 62-year-old project manager, said he was especially galled by the fact the party took place at the same time he had been unable to see his son, who was living in supported accommodation. “It’s not about Boris Johnson or left wing versus right wing. It’s about deceit,” he said. He voted for Johnson in the last election because of his stance on Brexit, and generally voted Conservative, but said he wouldn’t again. He viewed Labour and the Tories as “two sides of the same coin” and would opt for whichever party represented a protest vote instead. Shirley Clark, a retired administrator, had been suspicious of Johnson before the revelations and didn’t vote for him in the last election. “If the man can’t comb his hair, he can’t unscramble his brains.” But, she queried: “Who have we got who could take over?” Egle Sumskai, who is unemployed and aged 26, said the Downing Street party had changed her opinion of Johnson and she wouldn’t vote to return him as the constituency’s MP. “It’s not fair on all of us. I’m 100% sure he’s not the right person to lead the country.” Ali Taher, a 32-year-old retail worker, shared Sumskai’s sense of betrayal, and said he was “disappointed”. “Their real face is exposed. They are losing credibility,” he said. Taher was unable to vote during the last election and he said he was uncertain who he would vote for in future. “I like Boris Johnson’s character but not his policies. I feel that he divides rather than unites the nation. When it comes to real responsibilities and being prime minister, he doesn’t seem to take things seriously, especially in the last few years.” He is more interested in voting for a leftwing party, he said, but added that Keir Starmer “feels like a Tory in the closet”. However, several Conservative voters were grateful to Johnson for his work as a local MP. One man, who asked not to be named, gestured at the prosperous-looking high street. “Look how clean it is,” he said. His views were echoed by a property consultant who asked not to be named. He felt the Conservatives had helped him build a good life and enabled him to buy a house, and that journalists were “exaggerating” the parties. “They’re just sitting in the garden,” the 43-year-old said. He said he would vote Conservative again, and would like Rishi Sunak to be the next prime minister since the chancellor has performed well during the pandemic. Debbie Cusmans, a 57-year-old carer, said she had asked Johnson to help her fight an eviction notice, and he had done so. She voted for him last time, and would again. She brandished a copy of a newspaper with a picture of Johnson seated at a No 10 gathering with his wife, Carrie, and several colleagues. “You can’t call that a party,” she said, adding: “It’s a very difficult time to be prime minister.”  Join our journalists for a Guardian Live online event on the No 10 lockdown party and Boris Johnson’s future on Wednesday 19 January.

1/13/2022,"Retailers’ trading reports will roll in for a while yet, so there’s still time for losers to reveal themselves, but it was hard on Wednesday to find anybody who was unhappy with their Christmas lot or who is panicking about the year ahead. Sainsbury’s produced a £60m upgrade to its profits forecast alongside the usual excited blah about the “lowest ever” Christmas dinner and the “biggest ever” new year. Omicron clearly diverted a few quid from pubs and restaurants into supermarkets’ tills but the numbers were still strong on their own account. Meanwhile, JD Sports went for a £65m upgrade after enjoying a boom and Dunelm, the soft furnishings group, said profits would be “materially ahead” of market expectations.  Over at Whitbread (not a retailer but Christmas also matters for the owner of Premier Inn, Beefeater and Brewers Fayre) Omicron killed any chance of a profits surprise but the group said it traded “significantly ahead of the market” in the UK. What’s going on? Aren’t all these companies meant to be fretting about the cost-of-living squeeze on consumers, unresolved supply chain hassles and the arrival of inflation in their energy and wage bills? There was a bit of that, but the general tone was that companies expect to cope. Whitbread predicts inflation in its sector to average 7%-8%, adding £1.4bn to its cost base, but thinks it will be able to “largely offset” the pressures via cost savings, increases in room rates and the benefit of being a large business. The tale was similar at Dunelm: a mix of price rises and better sourcing will “largely mitigate the impact of inflation on commodity costs and freight rates”. The outlook wasn’t spelled out as clearly at Sainsbury’s, which is simultaneously trying to parade its Aldi price-matching credentials on 150 core products while also passing on cost pressures (such as 5.3% pay increase to base pay) where it can. It can count on its regular 2% annual saving from efficiency gains but can also, say analysts, expect the pricing climate to become easier in supermarket-land. That, at least, seems to be what Jefferies’ analysts mean by “a more rational industry structure in the face of building input inflation”. Discounters will have a “reducing appetite” for ploughing profits into lower prices and the private equity-owned players (Asda and Morrisons) “seem to be displaying a growing focus on profit preservation”. In ordinary English, profits margins won’t get whacked because prices will go up. From the point of view of shareholders, it all sounds reassuring, even if much hinges on whether consumers achieve wage increases to protect their disposable incomes. But, given the current strength in trading, one cannot be surprised that retailers think they stand a fair chance of making price rises stick. For the Bank of England, though, it’s another setback to 2021’s idea that the return of inflation would be “transitory”. In the retail and hotel sectors, that’s not how life looks at the start of 2022. According to the revised central banking script, inflation should peak at 6%-ish in the spring and then fall. Well, maybe. One can also see how pressures could linger, or take far longer to reverse. Boardrooms aren’t hiding the fact: they are consciously adjusting for an inflationary environment. On a similar theme, Chris O’Shea, the chief executive of Centrica, the British Gas owner, is only making a safe prediction when he says gas prices could stay high for two years. For consumers, at least 12 months is virtually guaranteed already because of the backward-looking nature of the regulator Ofgem’s price-cap formula. The increase in the price cap in April, which seems likely to be set at about £2,000 versus £1,277 currently, captures wholesale prices that have rocketed since autumn. The following adjustment, to apply from October, will look at wholesale prices in the first half of this year, which futures markets say will remain high. Indeed, the current best-guess is that £2,000 will be exceeded. Of course, the government and Ofgem can – and should – try to dampen the shock for consumers by various means, such as removing VAT, shunting green levies on to general taxation and deferring the costs of the many supplier failures. But ministers will presumably want to reimpose all those billing items as soon as wholesale prices fall. So, yes, two years is a reasonable horizon. But it could stretch a lot further.",News/Business,Festive boost for retailers adds to Bank of England’s inflation woes,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/jan/12/festive-boost-retailers-bank-of-england-inflation
1/13/2022,"Novak Djokovic could face a fine or even prison in Serbia after his admission that he broke isolation while he had Covid last month, lawyers have said, as the Serbian prime minister warned his behaviour appeared to be “a clear breach” of the rules. The 34-year-old Belgrade-born tennis player is chasing a record-breaking 21st grand slam victory at the Australian Open beginning on Monday, but could yet be deported by the government which is unhappy with his medical exemption from inoculation.  Djokovic on Wednesday acknowledged that he knew he had tested positive when he attended a newspaper interview and photoshoot in the Serbian capital on 18 December, saying in a statement on social media he had made an “error of judgment”. The player also blamed “human error” by his support team for a mistake in his immigration paperwork, saying they had failed to declare that he had travelled outside Serbia – to Spain – in the two-week period before entering Australia. Lawyers in Serbia told local reporters that breaking the country’s strict isolation rules was an offence under article 248 of the criminal code, and subject to a fine or prison sentence of up to three years – although community service was more likely. Djokovic was freed from an immigration detention hotel in Melbourne on Monday after a judge ruled his treatment was unreasonable. The unvaccinated star is relying on a recent previous coronavirus infection for an exemption allowing him to play. In an affidavit to the court, Djokovic said he was “tested and diagnosed” as having contracted Covid on 16 December. In his statement on Wednesday, however, he said was not notified of his positive status until the following day. He said he was not aware he had tested positive until after a tennis event he attended in Belgrade on 17 December to present awards to children, but admitted going to his tennis centre on 18 December for an interview and photoshoot for L’Equipe. Lawyers in Serbia said that as a major public figure, Djokovic, who is a national hero in his home country, risked an exemplary sanction, but if found guilty should in principle be able to negotiate a community service order. In the early stages of the pandemic, several Serbs who had tested positive for Covid were handed jail sentences of up to three years up for not isolating for 14 days, although recent convictions have entailed fines of about 150,000 dinar (£1,060). The Serbian prime minister, Ana Brnabić, said Djokovic should explain what she called a grey area. “If you’re positive you have to isolate,” Brnabić told the BBC, adding that if the player had broken the rules she would have to consult “relevant authorities”. Brnabić said she did not know for sure “when he actually got the results”. She said while she disagreed with his stance on vaccination, Djokovic was “one of the great champions of Serbia” and she hoped he could play in the tournament. Serbian authorities and media have largely remained fiercely supportive of the player despite the latest revelations. Earlier this week, Brnabić told a pro-government paper she was “sleeping with my mobile phone” in case she got a call about the case. “It was really important for me to express concern over the issue. I have offered the service of the Serbian government if there is anything we can do. We have agreed to stay in communication with Australian representatives,” she said. Mainly pro-government Serbian newspapers have not so far investigated Djokovic’s movements in Serbia while he had Covid, or questioned apparent anomalies in his test certificate. Of 18 different articles about the story on the website of the tabloid Informer on Wednesday, none questioned the player’s version of events. In an op-ed article in the same paper, the deputy mayor of Belgrade, Goran Vesić, attacked the Australian immigration minister, Alex Hawke, who is still considering whether to exercise personal powers to again revoke the player’s visa. “No one had heard of a certain immigration minister in Australia, Alex Hawke – but the whole world has heard of Novak Djokovic,” Vesic wrote. “Well, the world finally found out who Mr Hawke is.” Hawke would be “anonymous had he not held his citizens in house arrest for almost two years, treating them like convicts,” Vesic continued. “The Serb opposition calls us, the ruling party, dictators – but trust me, neither the president or any one of us would ever annul a court decision.” Milivoje Pantovic is a producer with N1 Television in Belgrade",Sport/Sport,Novak Djokovic faces fine or prison for breaking isolation while Covid positive,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/12/novak-djokovic-faces-fine-or-prison-for-breaking-isolation-while-covid-positive
1/13/2022,"Italian police have identified two men suspected of having vandalised the famed white limestone Scala dei Turchi (Stairway of the Turks) cliff in Sicily, which features prominently in the Inspector Montalbano books by the late author Andrea Camilleri. The cliff, shaped like a huge staircase jutting into the Mediterranean from the coast of Realmonte, was on Friday defaced with red iron oxide powder which left red stains running down the limestone.  Sicily’s governor condemned the vandalism as a “cowardly gesture” against not only “an asset of rare beauty, but also the image of our island”. Police on Wednesday said that two men from Favara, a short distance from the site, were identified and reported to the authorities for “damaging a protected natural asset”. The prosecutor’s office of Agrigento, which led the investigation, said that after a series of searches in neighbouring villages the two men had been identified on surveillance cameras. The footage shows two men leaving a Ford truck pulling two large sacks containing red powder. Investigators recovered traces of red powder and gloves stained with the same substance in a shed near the residence of one of the men. One of the alleged perpetrators had previously been convicted of vandalising the Milan metro and the Valley of the Temples at Agrigento, as well as the Punta Bianca white cliff near the Scala dei Turchi. The motive for the vandalism is still unclear, but prosecutors believe that the gesture represents a sort of “challenge of authority”. A group of volunteers from the area spent the weekend scrubbing the stains off the cliff. The Scala dei Turchi was submitted as a candidate for Unesco world heritage status in 2019. However, the landmark was temporarily closed and seized by prosecutors in early 2020 after years of complaints about its poor preservation. Every year, the gigantic white limestone cliff, which drops steeply over the sea, attracts thousands of visitors from around the world. Its name originates from ancient raids on the coast by pirates, probably Saracens.",News/World news,Police identify two suspects in Scala dei Turchi  vandalism,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/12/police-identify-two-suspects-in-scala-dei-turchi-vandalism
1/13/2022,"The British Olympic Association will offer temporary phones to Team GB athletes and staff at next month’s Winter Olympics in Beijing amid fears they could be spied on by the Chinese government. While the British delegation will not be banned from taking their own mobile devices, they have been warned against doing so by the BOA because it fears the authorities could install spyware to extract private information or track future activity.  A BOA spokesperson confirmed: “We’ve given athletes and staff practical advice so that they can make their own choice as to whether they take their personal devices to the Games, or not. Where they do not want to take their own equipment, we have provisioned temporary devices for them to use.” The Dutch Olympic Committee*Dutch Sports Federation (NOC*NSF) has gone a step further by telling its athletes not to bring their personal mobile phones or laptops because it anticipates that China may carry out surveillance on electronic devices during the Games. The Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant said the NOC*NSF would give athletes and support staff burner phones and laptops, which will then be destroyed when they return home from the Chinese capital. NOC*NSF spokesperson Geert Slot declined to discuss specific cases but said cybersecurity was part of the risk assessment made for the trip to China. “The importance of cybersecurity of course has grown over the years,” Slot said. “But China has completely closed off its internet, which makes it a specific case.” As at previous Olympics, Team GB athletes wanting to raise awareness of political issues during the event have been advised to discuss this with the BOA before doing so.

1/13/2022,"All 17 victims who died in the New York apartment fire tragedy on Sunday have been identified, with the devastating toll including eight children. The New York City medical examiner’s office reported that all the victims died of smoke inhalation and their deaths had been ruled accidental.  Fire officials have determined that a malfunctioning electric space heater started the fire in the 19-story building in the Bronx on Sunday morning, amid freezing weather. Meanwhile, companies associated with the building’s ownership and city authorities have been accused by tenants of neglecting vital safety measures there for years. Although flames damaged only a small part of the building, smoke poured through the open doors of a 15th-floor apartment and turned stairwells – the only way to escape a building deemed too tall for external fire escape staircases – into dark, choking death traps. According to Daniel Nigro, New York City’s fire commissioner, some were unable to escape because of the smoke. Others became incapacitated as they tried to escape, as more than 200 firefighters struggled to bring residents down fire department ladders or the stairwells. Survivors described the terrible scene, with one comparing it to “a war zone”. Eight of the fatalities were children, including a two-year-old boy. Police have released their identities. The victims included seven women, Fatoumata Drammeh, 50, Foutmala Drammeh, 21, Nyumaaisha Drammeh, 19, Haja Dukureh, 37, Sera Janneh, 27, Fatoumata Tunkara, 43, and Isatou Jabbie, 31; two men, Haji Dukary, 49, and Hagi Jawara, 47; five boys, Muhammed Drammeh, 12, Mustapha Dukureh, 12, Seydou Toure, 12, Omar Jambang, six, and the youngest victim of the fire, Ousmane Konteh, two; and three girls, Fatoumata Dukureh, five, Mariam Dukureh, 11, and Haouwa Mahamadou, five. Dozens more residents have been hospitalized and at least 13 were still in critical condition on Wednesday morning. Also, the first court action was brought in relation to the tragedy when tenants filed a $3bn class action lawsuit against the building’s previous and current owners. The lawsuit filed on Tuesday by married couple Rosa Reyes and Felix Martinez, both tenants of the building, alleges that the landlords “had actual notice of defective conditions”. The couple is seeking $1bn in compensatory damages for alleged negligence and an additional $2bn in punitive damages on behalf of them and “all others similarly situated”. Another plaintiff, Jessika Valdez, told the New York Post that the door to her 18th-floor apartment “never closed on its own” during the 15 years that she has lived there. “We always had to pull it closed,” Valdez said, adding: “If you’re renting to me, it’s OK if you don’t have an emotional tie to me, but you have to protect your investment. I’m your investment.” In addition, a separate notice of claim was filed against New York City and various entities, including the department of buildings, department of housing, preservation and development, the former Mayor Bill de Blasio and the housing commissioner, Melanie La Rocca. The notice, which seeks $1bn each for everyone who joined the planned class action case, said the shutting devices, or “returns”, on self-closing apartment doors “become rusty over time and the springs on the door returns need to be replaced every time”. It went on to allege that city officials “failed in every way” to prevent the tragedy. The notice detailed more than two dozen complaints and violations cited against the building since 2014. According to records, the citations include vermin infestation and faulty elevators, despite the $25m in state loans for repairs. The authorities have been accused of knowing of defects for years and paying lip service to safety issues. According to Nigro, the building’s doors and reports of malfunctioning smoke alarms will be a key focus of the investigation. The NYC law department has issued a response to the lawsuits, saying: “This was a horrific tragedy and too many lives were lost. There is an active investigation into this tragic incident. We’ll review the claim.” Similarly, the Bronx Park Phase II Preservation, LLC, a consortium of owners, said, “We are devastated by this terrible tragedy and are cooperating fully with the fire department and other agencies as they continue to investigate.”",News/US news,"Bronx fire: all 17 victims who died, including eight children, identified",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/12/bronx-fire-victims-who-died-identified
1/13/2022,"Christian Wolmar is right to raise serious concerns over the possibility of major cuts to the rail network (UK railways are heading into a perfect storm. Now is the time to nationalise them, 10 January). But I’m not convinced that his solution of nationalisation is the answer. He says that there’s an opportunity for “a publicly owned, integrated railway, run independently of state interference”. I’d say that was a contradiction in terms, and a return to a centralised British Rail would be subject to the whims of the Treasury, as it is now. That doesn’t mean we should stick with the unsatisfactory hybrid of a privately delivered, publicly specified railway. We need to learn from other European railways, where publicly accountable regional transport authorities run efficient rail networks, sometimes directly owned by the local state.  The Merseyrail network, specified by a locally accountable public body but privately delivered, works. Could Liverpool’s combined authority go a step further and own and operate the regional network, or set up an arms-length co-operative to do the job? I’m sure it could, and that could apply to many other regional networks across the country. Inter-city operations are different, and the example of “open access” operators such as Grand Central and the recently introduced Lumo suggests that there is a commercial as well as environmental case for good-quality long-distance services that are not subject to micromanagement by civil servants in London.Prof Paul SalvesonVisiting professor, universities of Huddersfield and Bolton  Christian Wolmar is right to say that the Covid-induced crisis hitting our railways needs to be addressed by nationalisation. As well as being more efficient, we calculate that it would save the industry at least £600m a year simply through preventing cash leaking into private profit. That includes the rolling stock companies who own our trains and have engaged in shameful pandemic profiteering to the tune of £1bn last year – all ultimately paid for by the taxpayer, while passenger fares rise. But instead of taking on vested interests, the government has decided to take on rail staff who have been key workers during the pandemic. The cuts agenda includes closing all ticket offices and slashing thousands of safety-critical track worker jobs. We are now heading towards a national dispute on our railways to defend rail jobs and services. If we are to protect our climate and economy, we need to protect our railways and rail workers.Michael LynchGeneral secretary, RMT  I was surprised that Christian Wolmar made no mention of the climate impact of a declining railway system. Rail is the most economical of all the major transport modes in terms of damaging carbon emissions. The government should be encouraging a “modal shift” to rail from car and air travel. Instead, there is a have-your-cake-and-eat-it policy that people don’t need to change their personal transport. The two most significant moves would be making rail travel much cheaper, and improving convenience and the integration of rail with other transport. This, along with a major government-backed publicity effort – many people haven’t used rail for years – could have a huge impact on lowering our transport sector’s carbon footprint. Upping the pace of rail electrification would be another huge positive, from which passengers, freight and the climate could gain.Tim DumperExmouth, Devon  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

1/13/2022,"The restructuring group Hilco took a £25m dividend payment from the DIY chain Homebase in 2020 despite accepting at least £10.6m in government aid. The company, which bought Homebase for £1 in 2018 from its Australian owner, Wesfarmers, said it had accepted business rates relief for the Homebase chain on top of £10.6m in furlough payments and grants for the Bathstore chain, which was forced to close for many weeks under government high street lockdowns.  The total amount of government assistance booked by Homebase has previously been estimated at up to £40m. The group operates about 150 DIY stores after closing 15 in 2020 and also owns 15 Bathstore outlets and two Decorate by Homebase stores, which are smaller high street versions of its DIY chain. The government support payouts came as the chain rang up a ££48m pretax profit in the year to 27 December 2020, from a ££8.2m loss a year before. Its highest paid director, thought to be the chief executive, Damian McGloughlin, also received a 14% pay rise to £1.42m. The change in fortunes came despite a 3.2% fall in sales to £839.2m, according to accounts filed at Companies House. Hilco UK, founded by the accountant Paul McGowan, who still chairs the business, is known as the group that bought the entertainment retailer HMV out of administration in 2013 before it later fell back into administration in 2018. The company also owns the British pottery Denby. Homebase said in its accounts that the government funding “was used to help offset the significant impact and losses from the temporary closure of all Homebase stores during the peak trading period and longer closures of Bathstore stores, Decorate by Homebase stores and kitchen and bathroom showrooms.” It added that the government support also “offset incremental costs due the pandemic” including protective equipment for staff and other health & safety measures as well as the multimillion-pound write-off of live plants due to store closures. It said the plants had been donated to charities and good causes. Homebase’s decision to hold on to government support, including business rate relief, contrasts sharply with other large retailers. Kingfisher, the owner of Homebase’s rival B&Q, pledged to repay the £130m it received in business rates relief in December 2020 after benefiting from a boom in DIY trade during the Covid pandemic. The business also handed back at least £23m in furlough payments. The shift to working and studying at home, as well as more entertaining at home, particularly outdoors, prompted many to alter their houses and flats to suit the new way of living. Boredom during lockdowns also enticed younger people to learn DIY skills to improve their homes. Other retailers, including all the large supermarkets, have also returned almost £2bn in business rates relief and furlough payments.

1/13/2022,"Thank our mutual god for the intelligence and eloquence of David Baddiel (‘Why don’t Jews play Jews?’ – David Baddiel on the row over Helen Mirren as Golda Meir, 12 January). But may I take issue with the Guardian on one point? I did not attack Dame Helen Mirren (Maureen Lipman attacks casting of Helen Mirren as former Israeli PM Golda Meir, 12 January). I was asked by a reporter for my opinion in a continuing debate. (I don’t tend to charge out of the house to Speaker’s Corner with a loud-hailer and a dustbin lid.) My opinion was that if the ethnicity or gender of the character drives the role then that ethnicity should be prioritised, as it is now with other minorities.  This applies, in my opinion, to the role of prime minister of the first and only Jewish state. Importantly, I also stated that Dame Helen is a great actress and very sexy in her seventh decade, which is important for playing Golda. Not being on social media, I haven’t seen the outcry, but I bet it is bigger than the outcry ever against casting Shylock, Golda, Tevye, Mank etc with non-Jews. Especially so from most Jewish people – the ones who can really see the difference the casting makes – but who prefer to keep their heads well below the parapet.Maureen LipmanLondon  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

1/13/2022,"A man has climbed on to the front of the BBC’s Broadcasting House headquarters and used a hammer to damage a prominent statue by Eric Gill, as another man shouted about the artist’s history of paedophilia. Gill was one of the most prominent early 20th-century British artists and designers until his death in 1940. But his diaries, published many decades later, reveal his sexual abuse of his daughters and family dog.  The carving, which depicts Prospero and a part-naked Ariel from Shakespeare’s The Tempest, was installed by the artist on the front of the BBC’s Broadcasting House headquarters in London in 1933, shortly after the building opened. It sits above the entrance to the BBC on Regent Street and is an integral part of the globally recognised Grade II*-listed building. The presence of an artwork by a known paedophile on the headquarters of the national broadcaster has become a regular focus of social media discussion and far-right activists such as Tommy Robinson have regularly cited its presence while criticising the BBC. More footage of Eric Gill’s BBC statue being chiselled at by a protestor pic.twitter.com/eWxm015byU The broadcaster’s culture editor, Katie Razzall, said that while one man had used a ladder to climb up the statue and chip away at its base with a hammer, another man stood nearby livestreaming and “talking about paedophiles”. BBC Monitoring journalist Shayan Sardarizadeh said the presence of Gill’s statue on the front of the building had been “an obsession for British QAnon, ‘save our children’, ‘Satanic ritual abuse’ and other conspiracy groups for a very long time”. The motives or identity of the person attacking the statue with a hammer are unknown. According to the BBC’s own website after the statue was installed in the 1930s and at the time there was public concern “about the size of the sprite’s genitalia”. “A question was tabled in the House of Commons, but the popular story, that Gill was ordered to modify the statue, is not substantiated,” states the corporation’s history of the artwork. In addition to his sculptures, Gill also created the widely used Perpetua and Gill Sans typefaces – with the BBC only dropping the use of the latter as its official font earlier this year. The BBC previously faced calls from sexual abuse charities to remove the statue from its headquarters in 2013 but refused, citing Gill’s record as “one of the last century’s major British artists whose work has been widely displayed in leading UK museums and galleries”. Although police have been called to the scene, the man has yet to be removed and has been allowed to continue chipping away at the statue for two hours. The damage to the BBC artwork comes shortly after a jury cleared four individuals of criminal damage after they removed a statue of the slave trader Edward Colston from its plinth in Bristol and dumped it in the city’s harbour. They successfully argued that they had been making a sincere protest against the Colston statue, were exercising their right to free speech, and insisted it was a criminal offence to keep that statue up because it was offensive. As a result the government has pledged to pass new laws to protect existing statues in public spaces, arguing it is better to provide context. Although many other statues have been targeted for removal in recent years, the Gill statue at the BBC is unusual because the objection is to the artist rather than the person it depicts.",News/Media,Man uses hammer to attack statue on front of BBC Broadcasting House,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/12/man-uses-hammer-to-attack-statue-on-front-of-bbc-broadcasting-house
