In a televised address to his country, Russia President Vladimir Putin said he would recognize two pro-Russia breakaway republics in Eastern Ukraine and made a case for invading Ukraine, saying that the country's pro-Western government was a threat to Russia. Earlier in the day, a Kremlin spokesperson said that there were no ""concrete plans"" for a summit between Putin and U.S. President Joe Biden as some 150,000 Russian troops have reportedly inched nearer to the Ukraine border. In recent weeks, worried investors have been adopting more risk-averse strategies in anticipation of rising energy prices and sanctions by the U.S. and its European allies on Russia and Russian retaliation that will likely affect a global economy already hammered by inflation and supply chain delays. Following Putin's speech, the Biden administration announced penalties against the breakaway Ukraine republics. The per barrel price of brent crude oil jumped past $97, a nearly 4% spike. At the time of publication, Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading trading at about $37,500, down over 3% for the previous 24 hours. Ether, the second largest crypto by market cap, was off about 1.6% over the same period. Other major cryptos were in negative numbers. U.S. equity markets were closed for the national Presidents Day holiday, but leading European stock exchanges, including the FTSE 100, the DAX in Frankfurt and CAC 40 in Paris finished in the red. Most major Asian indexes also lost ground on Monday, including the Japan: Nikkei 225, the Hong Kong: Hang Seng and the Asia Dow. ‘’Such is the sensitivity on the financial markets right now, temporary confidence can evaporate rapidly and that’s what we’ve seen today after what appears to be another deterioration in relations between Russia and Western powers,"" wrote Susannah Streeter, senior Investment and markets analyst for U.K.-based financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown, in an email. Not Every Currency Can be a Stablecoin Stablecoins have been the best thing ever for the hegemony of the dollar, as the digitization of fiat currency into tokens overwhelmingly favors the greenback. But as crypto is naturally home to dollar skeptics, certainly there must be a move to create stablecoins with alternative denominations. There’s a version of Tether denominated in Euros, and there are stablecoin projects denominated in Singapore’s dollar and Indonesia’s Rupiah, but these are three of the hundreds of currencies out there — certainly, there’s a demand for more, right? The problem is that many smaller economies aren’t a huge fan of the internationalization of their currency and ceding control. There aren't the right ingredients for a locally denominated stablecoin to take off in those countries. Consider Taiwan. Over the weekend Leo Seewald, the former head of BlackRock Taiwan, and now a director at Taipei-based exchange MaiCoin, discussed its new Taiwan-dollar (TWD) stablecoin. The project’s webpage cites “reducing the capital cost of local and cross-border transactions without intermediary” as a benefit of the project. But that goes against a pillar of Taiwan’s central bank’s monetary policy. Taiwan has strict capital controls on its currency — exporting Taiwan dollars is strictly forbidden with few exceptions. The central bank doesn’t want the Taiwan dollar to be used offshore as the democratically run island's arch-rival, China, could use an offshore TWD as a weapon by market-making an unofficial exchange rate through buying and dumping the currency at a disadvantageous price. The central bank is also not a big fan of the Taiwan dollar being used to settle transactions that don’t have a direct nexus to Taiwan — something a stablecoin is specifically designed to do. Last year it handed down significant fines against Deutsche Bank, ING, and ANZ for letting commodity traders price grain contracts between Brazil, India, and other third countries in TWD despite the deal having no nexus to Taiwan. In theory, this won’t work because the currency can’t be exported off-island, but the banks used a synthetic proxy for the TWD — a forex instrument called a non-deliverable forward — to get around this. And then there’s the export market. As an economy heavily reliant on exports it’d really sting if the local currency began to appreciate. Given the importance of Taiwan’s semiconductors, and the government’s usually balanced budgets, one would think the TWD would be headed towards the stratosphere. Not so, because of regular interventions in the FX market by the central bank to control the appreciation of the TWD. Very slow and steady wins the race, the bank believes. The mother of all ironies is that Taiwan is deemed to be more of a currency manipulator than China because of lack of transparency on the issue; everyone knows that the RMB is pegged and only trades within a specific band. Just don’t call Taiwan a currency manipulator. Or say they have capital controls. That gets central bankers and the diplomatic corps mad. In 2011, the governor of Taiwan’s central bank scolded reporters when addressed with the question. Foreign investors can buy equities, and move all the foreign currency they want through Taiwan, he said. Just don’t touch our precious TWD. Stablecoins can throw a wrench in all of this. A carefully managed currency from an export-driven economy with a geopolitical foe next door isn’t the best candidate to be deployed to the free-for-all that is the crypto market. Pricing crypto contracts in TWD, or having it be used as a medium of settlement via digital asset on-ramps or off-ramps is going to blow away all the tenants of the Central Bank’s decades of policies and punishments. The international grain market has nothing on crypto for volatility. Singapore isn’t a huge fan of the internationalization of its currency either. As Singapore is a largely importing nation given its lack of natural resources it strives for exchange rate stability and doesn’t want international deals with no nexus to the country priced in its currency. Denominate that in USD, please. But for stablecoins to get on the radar of these respective banks, they need to be bigger first. A lot bigger. Currently, the TWDC has minted 7.8 million Taiwan dollars of its tokens, or around $283,000; Singapore’s xSGD is further along with a market cap of $185 million. Far from enough to complement the currency (the kind that Bloomberg’s Mike McGlone argues Tether is to the dollar), but also far from enough to be the threat to the economy that the White House claims stablecoins are. Asia is going to be trading in USD-denominated stablecoins for the foreseeable future. And that’s a feature, not a bug.

2/22/2022,"Friday, another round of jaw-dropping stock sell-offs after earnings announcements hit the tape, when Roku (ROKU) stock plunged 23% and DraftKings (DKNG) cratered 22% — the second-worst one-day performance for both stocks. Nightmare earnings reactions have been a theme this quarter, as investors seize on concerns over slowing growth prospects for companies over a wide range of industries. Combined with an increasingly hawkish Federal Reserve and a potential land war in Europe, investors are facing a perfect storm of headwinds. Yet earnings is still the engine for appreciation of the U.S. equity capital markets. Yahoo Finance crunched the numbers — peering into the S&P 500 components as well as the top Yahoo Finance trending tickers over the last year — to find the biggest one-day performance meltdowns after earnings announcements. There was no shortage of candidates. Topping the list with the worst post-earnings performance is LendingClub (LC).The stock cratered 29% in one session in late January after they reported annual profit guidance that came up short of expectations. If we're looking for themes, the threat of higher short-term interest rates are dampening growth prospects. Plus LendingClub is a meme stock — which 1-800-Flowers.com (FLWS) is, too. But the go-to Valentine's Day shoppe posted results recently that may speak to the wider supply chain and demand issues gripping consumer-facing industries. Benchmark maintained its Buy rating on the stock after releasing disappointing quarterly results, but the firm lowered its price target to $28 from $47 — opining that the company had ""implied assumptions of no demand or supply chain improvements"" throughout 2022. In the consumer discretionary sector, along with 1-800-Flowers.com, we have LKQ Corp (LKQ), iRobot (IRBT), and Under Armour (UAA) in this list. Each is facing their own supply chain constraints and battles with inflation. But we find the most common post-earnings meltdown is in the communication services sector. Topping that list is Roku, which suffered the same fate as Meta Platforms (FB), parent company of Facebook, during the quarter when Apple rejiggered its operating system to require opt-in from consumers for cross-app tracking. Also weighing on Roku stock are supply chain issues for its in-TV devices along with a substantial and costly commitment for investment this year. Roku stock has round tripped its meteoric ascent from mid-2020 into early 2021 — trading from $100 per share to nearly $500 in less than a year. A casual reader glancing at the above chart would be forgiven for thinking it's a meme stock. But this $15 billion company — $60 billion at its peak — has annual revenues of $2.8 billion. Meta's revenues? An incredible $133 billion last year. Yet the stock is trading like a small-cap biotech firm that just announced a phase 3 trial failure. Except its market cap dropped by a cool quarter trillion dollars — the largest value wipeout in history — the day after it announced stagnating user growth along with a $10 billion loss on its investment in the metaverse. Whether you call them daily active users, subscribers, or just plain consumers — they're either growing at a much slower pace than anticipated or they're simply dropping out. And then there's PayPal (PYPL), with its chart looking more meme-ish than that of Roku. If we're looking for a theme, these stock routs aren't limited to any particular sector. It's simply about growth factors, interest rate sensitivity, balance sheet strength and overall structural positioning inside the new post-pandemic norm. We can go down the list of companies in this cohort seemingly sharing the same panoply of investor concerns — Roblox (RBLX), Spotify (SPOT), Shopify (SHOP) — even Clorox (CLX). But Charles Schwab Chief Investment Strategist Liz Ann Sonders, who spoke with Yahoo Finance Friday, has a simple message for investors who may be contemplating buying the proverbial dip. ""I wouldn't just try to bottom fish a disaster simply because the stock has gone down a lot in an environment like this where growth has slowed ... I think quality value fundamentals matter,"" said Sonders. ""And if you happen to see a drawdown and the fundamentals are still there, absolutely, but I wouldn't bottom fish purely based on price decline.""

2/22/2022,"Towards the end of 2020, once we learned a COVID-19 vaccine was ready for the masses, Wall Street began to warn investors of a new markets dynamic. High-growth tech stocks would fall out of favor with investors, the message went. In its place, overlooked value stocks—think energy and consumer staples—would make a comeback. Wall Street nailed the forecast. So far in 2022, once high-flying tech stocks are taking it on the chin, with the Nasdaq down 14.4% year-to-date, and down 16.4% since hitting an all-time high in mid-November, just before the Omicron wave arrived to batter the developed world. To be sure, very few stock-picking pros are calling this the bottom. ""While there are plenty of reasonably valued and profitable companies in the market, there are many more dangerously overvalued and unprofitable companies whose stocks could fall much further, and some even to zero,"" David Trainer, CEO of Nashville-based investment research firm, New Constructs, tells Fortune. Even before Omicron, investors were treating a large basket of growth stocks—names like Zoom, PayPal and the companies you'd find in Cathie Wood's Ark Innovation ETF, all of which soared during the latter half of 2020—as if it were the plague. Once investors got a whiff that top-line growth for these companies was slowing, they started to cash out. In many cases, the latest rout in tech stocks has been far more damaging to investor portfolios than what we saw during the stock market collapse of February and March 2020, just after the World Health Organization declared COVID to be a pandemic. PayPal is one such company that's getting punished by investors. The stock closed on Friday at $103.65, 15% below its 2020 pre-pandemic high. The collapse in PayPal shares has been nothing short of breathtaking. From its March, 2020 low, shares more than tripled over the next 15 months as usage and revenues soared. And then, just as quickly, the shares collapsed, shedding billions in value as growth started flatlining. The digital payments specialist has now lost two-thirds of its value since its mid-summer 2021 all-time high. The gutting loss has been particularly painful for PayPal bulls. The share-price collapse over the past seven months has been twice as dramatic as what investors saw in those dark days of February and March 2020. As the chart below shows, PayPal is hardly alone. Netflix, Facebook parent Meta, and Twitter have also seen bigger hits to their share prices in this latest round of sell-offs than what occurred in the early days of COVID. The light-colored red line in the chart measures the share sell-off during the epic February-March 2020 sell-off. Let's call that Round One. The darker red line above measures the Round Two carnage, calculated as the share-price performance of these stocks since their most recent all-time high and Friday's closing price. View this interactive chart on Fortune.com One stock that's not on the chart: Moderna. The Nasdaq-listed vaccine specialist, and a symbol of investors' now-dashed exuberance for growth-stocks, is down 71% since its August all-time high. If investors learned anything from the dot-com sell-off a generation ago, it's that tech stocks are vulnerable to boom-bust cycles. On his blog this weekend, Ben Carlson, a portfolio manager at Ritholtz Wealth Management and a regular Fortune columnist, took a stab at answering the provocative question: How long does it take for tech stocks to recover? The bad news: the historical record isn't great. He notes that it took Microsoft 16 years to return to its 1999 all-time high, and that Intel and Cisco still trade well below those glory days. ""Tech stocks,"" he writes, ""are prone to these boom-bust cycles because innovation always causes bubbles. We simply can’t help ourselves. ""I’m not saying today’s tech stocks that are getting killed are in for a similar extended winter,"" he continues. ""But growth investors also shouldn’t assume all of these stocks that are down 50-80% are going to be back at new highs in a hurry."" Zoom in to the last year, and you see just how bad the constituent parts of the Nasdaq are performing in recent months. Carlson lays out the bad news in the following tweet: https://twitter.com/awealthofcs/status/1494685392054132738 Even after such a sharp sell-off, analysts still see many of these hobbled tech stocks as too pricey. ""With some tech stocks like Meta Platforms, Twitter and Nvidia, we believe we are only seeing early signs of capitulation and there is plenty of more downside ahead from here,"" Trainer reckons. He also takes issue with meme stocks. A few darlings of the Reddit crowd—Robinhood, AMC Entertainment and Bed Bath & Beyond—are down 86%, 75% and 69%, respectively, off their all-time highs. His advice: stay away from meme stocks. Far away. ""No matter what the latest investing trend is, fundamentals will always matter. The meme stock trader's don't understand this, and quite frankly, they may never understand this,"" he adds.
