2/13/2022,"The United States presents itself as the beacon of democracy in contrast to the autocracies of China and Russia. Yet American democracy is in danger of succumbing to the same sort of oligarchic economics and racist nationalism that thrive in both these powers. After all, it wasn’t long ago that Donald Trump – who openly admired Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin – encouraged racist nationalism in America while delivering much of the US government into the hands of America’s super-rich.  Now state-level Republicans are busily suppressing votes of people of color and paving the way for a possible anti-democratic coup, while the national Republican party excuses the attack on the Capitol – calling it “legitimate political discourse” – and censors Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, the only two congressional Republicans serving on the panel investigating that attack. America’s oligarchic wealth, meanwhile, has reached levels rivaling or exceeding those of Russia and China. During the pandemic, America’s 745 billionaires increased their holdings by 70%, adding $2.1tn to their wealth in just over a year. A portion of this wealth is going into politics. As early as 2012, more than 40% of all money spent in federal elections came from the wealthiest of the wealthiest – not the top 1% or even the top tenth of the 1%, but from the top 1% of the 1%. Now, some of this wealth is supporting Trumpism. Peter Thiel, a staunch Trump supporter whose net worth is estimated by Forbes to be $2.6bn, has become one of the Republican party’s largest donors. Last year, Thiel gave $10m each to the campaigns of two protégés – Blake Masters, who is running for the Senate from Arizona, and JD Vance, from Ohio. Thiel is also backing 12 House candidates, three of whom are running primary challenges to Republicans who voted to impeach Trump for the events of January 6. The combination of oligarchic wealth and racist nationalism is treacherous for democratic institutions in the US and elsewhere. Capitalism is consistent with democracy only if democracy reduces the inequalities, insecurities, joblessness, and poverty that accompany unbridled profit-seeking. For the first three decades after the second world war, democracy did this. The US and war-ravaged western Europe built the largest middle classes the world had ever seen, and the most buoyant democracies. The arrangement was far from perfect, but with the addition of civil rights and voting rights, subsidized healthcare (in the US, Medicare and Medicaid), and a vast expansion of public education, democracy was on the way to making capitalism work for the vast majority. Then came a giant U-turn, courtesy of Ronald Reagan in America and Margaret Thatcher in Europe. Deregulation, privatization, globalization, and the unleashing of finance created the Full Monty: abandoned factories and communities, stagnant wages, widening inequality, a shrinking middle class, political corruption and shredded social support. The result has been widespread anger and cynicism. Even before the pandemic, most people were working harder than ever but couldn’t get ahead, and their children’s prospects weren’t any better. More than one out of every six American children was impoverished and the typical American family was living from paycheck to paycheck. At the same time, a record high share of national wealth was already surging to the top. Starting last July, America did an experiment that might have limited these extremes and reduced the lure of racist nationalism. That’s when 36 million American families began receiving pandemic payments of up to $3,000 per child ($3,600 for each child under six). Presto. Child poverty dropped by at least a third, and the typical family gained some breathing space. But this hugely successful experiment ended abruptly in December when Senator Joe Manchin joined 50 Republican senators in rejecting President Biden’s Build Back Better Act, which would have continued it. They cited concerns over the experiment’s cost – an estimated $100bn per year, or $1.6tn over 10 years. But that’s less than big corporations and the rich will have saved on taxes from the Trump Republican tax cut of 2018. Repeal it, and there would be enough money. The cost is also less than the increase in the wealth of America’s 745 billionaires during the pandemic. Why not a wealth tax? The experiment died because, put simply, the oligarchy didn’t want to pay for it. Oligarchic economics coupled with racist nationalism marks the ultimate failure of progressive politics. Beware. When the people are no longer defended against the powerful, they look elsewhere.

2/13/2022,"David Lammy has written to the government asking it to pardon 70 abolitionists convicted for their role in the historic 1823 Demerara rebellion by enslaved people against British colonialists in the Caribbean. The shadow foreign secretary described the revolt, involving 10,000 enslaved people, as a “seminal moment” in the history of slave resistance. Although unsuccessful at the time, the event contributed to the abolition of slavery 10 years later, in 1833.  Lammy said exercising the royal prerogative of mercy to grant pardons to those involved in the uprising, which was brutally crushed by the colonial militia in part of present-day Guyana, would be “a significant step in Britain’s acknowledgment of its role in the history of slavery”. The letter names 73 people who were tried, 70 of whom were found guilty, including 21 who were executed, including 10 who were decapitated after being hanged and had their heads put on poles. Hundreds of others were killed during and in the immediate aftermath of the uprising. Lammy highlights two particular cases, that of Jack Gladstone, a slave who was the principal organiser of the uprising, and John Smith, a young British Protestant minister, both of whom were sentenced to death before having their sentences commuted. Gladstone, who was “owned” by John Gladstone, the father of future prime minister William Gladstone, was non-violent according to testimonies – and also intervened to prevent other acts of violence. After his death sentence was commuted he was transported to St Lucia for hard labour. Smith had his sentence commuted by King George IV but died in prison in 1824 before the decision was communicated to Demerara. A two-day debate on whether to pardon him posthumously took place in parliament in June of that year, but the motion was defeated. In the letter, addressed to the justice secretary, Dominic Raab, Lammy wrote: “In recent years, this country has entered into a discussion about its colonial history and the path to repair. The full pardoning of both John Smith and Jack Gladstone would be a significant step in Britain’s acknowledgment of its role in the history of slavery. Both John Smith and Jack Gladstone were pioneers of the abolition movement, and they must be remembered and celebrated as such. It is for this reason that I am requesting a pardon through the exercise of the royal prerogative or mercy.” Demerara was one of Britain’s most lucrative colonies, being rich in sugar plantations at a time when the British economy was heavily dependent on the crop. It was known for the harsh treatment of enslaved people, designed to discourage them from rebelling against the white colonialists they heavily outnumbered. Lammy, who has spoken previously about the legacy of slavery and its impact on black Britons, based the letter on research into the Demerara uprising contained in the book White Debt. In a reply from Raab sent to Lammy on Wednesday, the justice secretary said that following Guyana gaining independence in 1966 and the country becoming a republic in 1970, it would be for the president of Guyana to grant such pardons. Thomas Harding, the author of White Debt, described Raab’s response as “shocking”. He said: “Britain was responsible for this gross miscarriage of justice, not Guyana, and the British government should be the one to pardon those found guilty. The men and women who took part in the Demerara uprising of 1823 were attempting to abolish British slavery. It was a British court martial which found the 70 people guilty, a court established by a British governor in a British colony (later known as ‘British Guiana’), on behalf of the British king, under British military code. “Now is the time for the British government to take full responsibly for its legacy of slavery, to pardon the ‘Demerara 70’ and recognise them for what they were: heroes, for all of us.” ",News/World news,David Lammy requests pardon for 1823 slave rebellion convicts,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/13/david-lammy-requests-pardon-for-1823-slave-rebellion-convicts
2/13/2022,"The Burrell Collection is majestic and abundant, a rich man’s hoard of 9,000 objects, industrial wealth transmogrified into Chinese porcelain and medieval stained glass, paintings by French impressionists and Scottish colourists, Persian carpets, suits of armour, Roman and Egyptian antiquities. Amassed by the Glaswegian shipping magnate Sir William Burrell, it was given by him and his wife, Constance, to the city of Glasgow in 1944. Eventually, in 1983, a new building was completed to house it, in Pollok Country Park, the city’s largest green space. It’s an exceptional work of architecture whose conception goes back to 1971, when the young Cambridge-basedarchitects Barry Gasson, John Meunier and Brit Andresen won a competition to design the collection’s home. Its principal aim was to make the most of its natural setting, in high, pillared, glass-walled galleries that allowed you to see a Rodin bronze or a Ming sculpture against a woodland backdrop. But it didn’t get you there immediately. As Meunier now puts it, you experienced “a gradual immersion into the magical world of the collection”.  First, you wandered through rooms in red sandstone and timber, part castle, part domestic, part glasshouse, both crafted and industrial, intimate and grand, eclectic and varied like the collection, and responsive to both its personal and public aspects. Gothic doorways and window surrounds were built into the fabric. Confident concrete columns and robust timber beams stood alongside the art in relationships of mutual respect. The art and architecture worked together in a three-dimensional composition. Next month, the Burrell reopens after a £68.25m renovation lasting more than five years. The aim was to fix defects in the ageing fabric and reverse declining visitor numbers, from 1 million a year when the building opened to 150,000 by 2015. A rearranged interior allows a 35% increase in gallery space, enabling more rotation of the exhibits, which it is hoped will attract more visitors. A “hub” has been formed in the heart of the building, an atrium with stepped seating for events. A new main entrance has been formed, so as to encourage more passersby to enter from the park. In the original layout you entered through a portal in the end of a long pitched-roof wing that looked like a fragment of a monastery. This was felt to be too “ecclesiastical” and off-putting by the architect for the renovation, John McAslan + Partners, and the route through the wing protracted and awkward. The new entrance takes you across an open “piazza” through glass doors into the centre of the complex. Necessary steps have been taken to fix leaking roofs, improve climate controls and bring the collection up to current standards of sustainability, conservation and display. The engineer Arup has meticulously worked out a way of upgrading the extensive glazing, such that it looks the same as the more primitive system of the original structure. It is certainly welcome that more of the collection can be shown in better conditions than before. Most of the building’s magic is still there. It is like a man-made version of a walk in a park, where the glass-walled galleries achieve as close a connection as possible between art and trees. There are frequent inversions of inside and out: some internal walls are made of thick stone, as if they were external, and much of the glazed exterior skin wishes itself towards invisibility. From deep inside the building you see greenery through layers of space and objects. Daylight comes from many directions, sometimes flooding through a glazed roof, sometimes glimpsed at the end of a vista. There is also a pleasing contrast of building techniques: the stone is hewn and carved, made to last for ever, while the assemblies of concrete and timber have a basic, just-bolted-together feel. John Meunier, though, is not happy. He has publicly decried the relocation of the entrance, which has entailed the displacement of some stained glass. The original design also included the reconstruction of three rooms from Burrell’s home, Hutton Castle, two of which have now gone. Meunier objects, he tells me, to “the crassness of the abrupt transition from outside to inside, as opposed to the carefully orchestrated transition from the quotidian life outside to the exquisite, almost timeless life among the objects in the collection, a transition of light levels as well as space”. John McAslan says that the changes are necessary for ease of circulation, and that the lost rooms were little visited. What’s at stake here is a clash of cultures. The Burrell represents a road that turned out to be less travelled in modern British architecture, where buildings were considered as things composed, like music or poetry, an attitude that includes the possibility that a less than obvious route to a desired destination might be desirable. McAslan, who once worked for Richard Rogers, comes from the more dominant hi-tech approach, which is more about problem-solving and directness. His way aligns with that of modern museums, which seek accessibility and permeability. The old Burrell, says its management, no longer met “visitor expectations or standards required for a major cultural building”. They will do what they have to do to work with a listed structure such as the Burrell, but they don’t want the architecture to get in the way of their objectives. The subtle qualities of which Meunier speaks can get blown away in the process. The Burrell is run by Glasgow Life, a charity that “delivers a wide range of services on behalf of Glasgow City Council”. You can’t blame them for wanting the building to meet its needs, and conceivably there was no alternative to moving the entrance, but something has certainly been lost. Every part of the original building had personality and intent. Or soul, if you like. McAslan’s most significant interventions in the Burrell don’t really do soul: they do the job, often with quality and skill, but without particular feeling for this unique place. The main new moves – piazza, sliding glass doors, atrium – are the stuff of corporate and cultural buildings everywhere. The Burrell is a collection like no other, for which reason it had a building like no other. It still has, and in important ways it’s better than before, but it has become a little more normal.

2/13/2022,"The mountain lion known as P22 has become something of a celebrity in the city of Los Angeles. The big cat resides in Griffith Park, a 4,000-acre park tucked in the Hollywood hills, and has inspired murals, songs and even an exhibit about his life. This February marks 10 years since scientists first found P22 while setting up camera traps in the area. His discovery was considered jaw-dropping, and scientists say that P22 has come to symbolize something uniquely LA, a city where wild landscapes rub shoulders with dense urbanism.  “A city long bashed for being a concrete jungle full of smog proves the world wrong by making a home for a mountain lion,” says Beth Pratt, California director for the National Wildlife Federation. Pratt even has a tattoo of P22 and dubbed him the “Brad Pitt of mountain lions” – attractive, enigmatic and unlucky in love. He has plenty of deer to eat, no male competitors in his territory, but also no hope to find a mate. Pratt points out that in any other part of the country, P22 probably would have been removed or killed. In Los Angeles, he’s famous. P22’s journey to Griffith Park began many miles away in the Santa Monica mountains, which have been home to 100 lions and where P22 was born, around 2010. P stands for puma and the number corresponds to the individual cat that is part of a scientific study by National Park Service biologists, who are researching mountain lions in the Santa Monica mountains. Sometime around 2012, P22 left the Santa Monica mountains and set off on a remarkable 50-mile journey that took him across two major Los Angeles freeways, evading traffic and human detection. He eventually found the wilderness of Griffith Park to set up his range – at 8 sq miles, it’s probably the smallest roaming territory of any known mountain lion (typically a male cat’s territory is 150 sq miles). When he was caught on film in Griffith Park, he probably hadn’t been there for very long. He was soon fitted with a collar to track his movements, and the city started to fall in love. Gerry Hans still remembers the remarkable day that P22 was found. Hans, the president of the nonprofit Friends of Griffith Park, had just brainstormed a camera trap survey of the park, to see what kinds of creatures were making the area home. But he and biologists in the park were startled to discover that, alongside the coyotes, bobcats and foxes, their cameras picked up the unmistakable image of a mountain lion. Hans said he wanted to be sensitive about how others would take the news: “We released a study report of the camera traps, and gently slipped it in that there was a mountain lion,” he says. “There was a lot of nervousness from residents.” P22 has never posed danger to people, choosing to coexist peacefully and lurk in the night, keeping his distance from human neighbors. Scientists point out that P22 lives in an urban park visited by millions of people and is rarely seen. A few times over the past years, P22 has found himself in hot water. In 2014, he became sick after eating an animal that had been killed with rodenticide. That led to a public outcry about the availability of such poisons, and in October 2020 California passed into law AB 1788, which bans the use of the most lethal anticoagulant rodenticides. In 2015, he got trapped underneath a house, creating a media circus – and a desperate problem-solving effort to get him out. The following year, he leapt an 8ft wall into the LA Zoo and mauled a sleeping koala to death. Instead of singling out the cat, the Zoo changed its policy of letting animals wander outside during the night. P22 has also become a symbol of the need for wildlife crossings to reconnect habitats fragmented by human development. Los Angeles is set to break ground on the world’s largest wildlife crossing in early 2022, which will connect two parts of the Santa Monica mountain range, allowing P22’s kin – and animals from lizards to birds – to increase their range and allow for more genetic diversity. What might the next decade bring for the iconic puma? In the wild, mountain lions only live a dozen years, but in captivity they can live up to 20 or more, Hans says. “P22 is somewhere between being out in the wild and in captivity,” he says. “He likely is not going to ever die from interaction with other male lions.” That leaves him time to increase his rising stardom. P22 is a remarkable animal and so totally an LA cat, says Pratt. “Like many Angelenos, he’s chill, likes hanging out under the Hollywood sign, and managed to navigate the brutal traffic on the 101 and 405.” Pratt says she loves how this city has embraced an apex predator. “The LA area possesses a value of coexisting with wildlife that I celebrate – people share their Ring videos of P22 making an appearance in their back yard with excitement, not fear,” she says. Not bad for a small town cat – he truly did make it big in Hollywood.",News/US news,‘The Brad Pitt of mountain lions’: how P22 became Los Angeles’ wildest celebrity,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/13/los-angeles-mountain-lion-griffith-park
2/13/2022,"Vulnerable Australians are being forced into “hiding at home” and lower-income workers are skipping meals because of the cost of rapid Covid tests, unions and welfare charities warn, as they plead with the Morrison government to reverse its opposition to providing free testing kits for all. Despite the government’s recent move to make rapid antigen tests tax deductible, a coalition of advocacy groups including the Australian Council of Social Services (Acoss) and the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) warn the tax write-off plan provides a greater discount to higher-income earners.  The groups also argue the existing concessional access scheme – which provides up to 10 free RATs over three months to eligible recipients and is loss-making for some pharmacists – has not done enough to allow all Australians to access tests when they need them. The ACTU will on Monday deliver a petition to parliament calling for free and accessible RATs for all Australians. More than 150,000 people had signed the petition by Sunday night. Michele O’Neil, the ACTU president, said making rapid testing kits free for everyone was “the only way we’re going to keep workplaces and the wider community safe from Omicron, and alleviate at least some of the immense stress being placed on our healthcare workers”. “Low-income workers have been on the frontline of this pandemic from the very beginning. It is unfair that they are having to shoulder the burden of paying for their own rapid antigen tests, just so they can keep themselves, their workplaces and their loved ones safe,” O’Neil said. The Acoss chief executive, Cassandra Goldie, said “for many the decision to buy a RAT means a missed meal or a bill that can’t be paid on time – those are real-time decisions which cannot be put off”. “People who have the least have borne the brunt of this pandemic for over two years. But the government’s announcement last week to give tax deductions for Covid tests gives greater assistance to those on higher incomes.” The ACTU and Acoss, together with charities including the Federation of Ethnic Communities’ Councils of Australia, Public Health Association Australia, Public Health Association Australia, St Vincent de Paul Society, Anglicare, Uniting Care, and Catholic Social Services Australia, have also issued a joint statement backing the plea. “The current distribution model centred on private retail sales to individuals and businesses is not fit for purpose. It leaves too many behind and too often the financial means of people will determine whether they have adequate access to RATs,” the statement said. “People at risk are hiding at home, unable to know who is safe; workers are expected to put themselves in harm’s way without access to tests; concession card holders struggle to access the limited number of RATs notionally allocated to them,” it said. The groups argue the government should follow the UK and US in providing free kits for the entire community. “The move to large-scale RAT testing has been beset with problems including reliance on market forces to ration inadequate supply, slow delivery, the PCR testing system collapsing under the weight of overwhelming demand, and price gouging from elements of the retail distribution network,” the groups said. Rapid antigen kits became the recommended Covid testing option in many states when PCR lab capacity became overwhelmed in December. The Morrison government has resisted calls to make kits free for all Australians, instead requiring people to meet criteria for the tests at testing hubs, or else purchase the tests themselves. In addition to the tax deduction and concessional card holder schemes, in late January the government made it possible for National Disability Insurance Scheme participants to dip into their core funding to purchase rapid antigen tests for themselves and their support workers. A spokeswoman for health minister Greg Hunt, when asked why the government does not provide universal free testing kits, told Guardian Australia: “we reject the premise of the question that we oppose free rapid antigen tests for all Australians.” “All Australians can currently access a free rapid antigen test through state run testing hubs if they have symptoms or are a close contact,” the spokeswoman said, noting the Commonwealth funds half of the costs of RATs provided in these settings. The spokeswoman also noted the government’s provision of 11.5m free RATs to residential aged care facilities since August last year, its concession card holder scheme – which he said had so far provided 8.3m kits to 2 million Australians - as well as the newly announced tax deductibility of RATs for workers. In January, the consumer watchdog referred retailers charging “beyond outrageous” prices for rapid antigen tests to the federal police for investigation.",News/Australia news,‘A RAT means a missed meal’: Morrison government urged to make rapid Covid tests free for all,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/13/a-rat-means-a-missed-meal-morrison-government-urged-to-make-rapid-covid-tests-free-for-all
2/13/2022,"The term “fever dream” – employed to describe the woozy, boozy, blurred-around-the-edges kind of cinema that defies easy categorisation – is rather overused in film criticism, vut in the case of Petrov’s Flu, with its sickly delirium, baffling hallucinogenic tangents and a central character who spends most of the film coughing his lungs out, it is entirely fitting. Long, disorientating takes, with camerawork that oozes rather than flows, like slowly congealing blood, switch us from despairing buses crammed with passengers, germs and cigarette smoke to grotesque children’s parties, a memory twisted in Petrov’s (Semyon Serzin) overheated brain. The film unfolds over the course of what might be a day but could be decades, in post-Soviet Russia. Petrov, a comic-book artist, is semi-separated from his wife, Petrova (Chulpan Khamatova), a librarian who has violent fantasies of retribution exacted on members of the local poetry club. Or perhaps the fantasies bleed into reality and she genuinely is soaked in the blood of a customer whose lending history aroused her ire.  Like much in this heady, unsavoury film, Petrova’s extracurricular activities are open to multiple interpretations.

2/13/2022,"Real snow finally arrived at the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and disrupted events on Sunday, leading to mixed fortunes for the Alpine skiiers who were breaking new ground for their countries in difficult conditions. Saudi Arabia’s Fayik Abdi finished 44th, but Haiti’s Richardson Viano failed to finish. Benjamin Alexander, Jamaica’s first ever Alpine skiier, was slowest of those to complete the course, finishing more than a minute behind the gold medallist, Switzerland’s Marco Odermatt.  The environmental impact of the artificial snow used by hosts China has been widely criticised, but with a blizzard affecting the north of the country on Sunday, at the Yanqing skiing venue it was the real thing that was the problem. The second run of the giant slalom event was delayed for over an hour waiting for conditions to improve. “You can’t see much, you don’t know where to put your feet, said the eventual bronze medal winner, Mathieu Faivre of France, after his first run. Abdi and Viano represented countries making their first ever appearance at a Winter Games, but the medals inevitably went to more traditional skiing powerhouses. Odermatt finished with a combined time of 2:09:35, putting him 0.19 seconds ahead of Slovenia’s Zan Kranjec. The debutants were all vocal in hoping to encourage greater participation in winter sports in their respective nations. Fayik Abdi had been fast-tracked by Saudi authorities into competing – he only took up skiing a year ago. He finished 44th, some 37 seconds off the pace of the leaders. After the race he said: “Our goal wasn’t just to finish − our goal was to ski as best as we could. I am happy I tried my best. It could have gone better for sure. The fact we finished is definitely a plus. “I don’t want it to be about me − I want it to be about Saudi and inspiring and encouraging Saudis to do what they love and to find a passion,” Abdi added. “I just hope I influence people and represent Saudi the right way.” Alexander, the 38-year-old former DJ who moved from the UK to Wyoming in order to improve his skiing, was representing Jamaica as their first ever Alpine skier. Ahead of the Games he had said his aim going down the giant slalom was “survival”. He finished ahead of eight skiers who did not finish their second run, and 35 others who scored a DNF on their first run. “Frickin’ hell, that was hard,” he said out loud in comments caught on camera after he crossed the finish line. Norway’s Henrik Kristoffersen, who finished eighth, praised the decision by the authorities to press ahead with the race despite the snow. “Definitely, the light is more than skiable, it just makes it difficult. I like it,” he said. “The snow is a little uneven so it is quite aggressive in spots. I think it was difficult for everyone.” The adverse weather in China on Sunday caused the freestyle skiing slopestyle women’s qualification to be cancelled, depriving the home crowd another view of gold medallist Eileen Gu. The men’s 4 x 10km cross-country relay race was completed in a time more than 20 minutes slower than at the last Olympics due to the conditions, and the women’s downhill training session at Yanqing was canceelled. Haiti’s flag-bearer at the opening ceremony, Viano, made it through the first intermediary checkpoint on his first run in the giant slalom before getting his DNF. The 19-year-old was adopted from an orphanage on the island nation by an Italian couple who live in Briançon, France. There he learned to ski, and later in life was contacted by the Haitian Ski Federation about representing them. He got his Haitian passport in 2019, and has since said that his aim includes going back to the orphanage he came from. “I am proud to show them my success. I really want to go back there to see my roots and especially to give dreams to young people through sport and its values.”",Sport/Sport,Skiing outsiders make their mark as arrival of real snow causes setbacks,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/13/winter-olympics-beijing-alpine-skiing-giant-slalom-real-snow
2/13/2022,"Under a glaring sky, Mauritian survey teams set off in two tender boats to measure Blenheim Reef on Sunday morning. A line of breakers marked the outer line of the atoll. An inflatable, carrying two Swedish marine experts retained by the Mauritian government, found an entrance through submerged rocks and surf into calmer water inside.  In the shallows, the two Swedes placed tide gauges on the sea floor to measure the water height – crucial evidence for a forthcoming case at the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea. The survey and the tribunal case are proof that Mauritius is intent on asserting its rights to the Chagos Archipelago, as confirmed by successive international law rulings and a UN general assembly vote. The Foreign Office, outflanked by legal judgments, has so far avoided confrontation with Mauritius, claiming in its statements that it is cooperating with environmental research. The UK government still maintains that it holds sovereignty over British Indian Ocean Territory (Biot). The purpose of the Mauritian survey is to establish whether any part of the reef remains above water even at high tide. If it does, the UN convention on the law of the sea will allow the country to extend its baseline in calculating its 200-mile exclusive economic zone. It would only take a small rock or shingle beach staying above water all the time for the baseline to be extended. The dispute over marine boundaries is with neighbouring Maldives. The international tribunal has already ruled that the UK has no legitimate claims in the area. The second Mauritian survey team set off in an open motor boat, scanning the outer reef for signs of boulders or sand bars appearing above the ocean swell. At one point, one small protruding rock was visible in the troughs between waves. A barely submerged rock platform, perhaps a metre below the surface, was visible further along the reef. The outer survey team motored around the perimeter, a distance of at least 10 nautical miles until, at one point, the mother ship was a distant smudge on the horizon. Dolphins raced along beside the bows of the boat, leaping playfully out of the water. Flying fish erupted from the seas remaining airborne for remarkably long periods. Back on the Bleu De Nîmes, the cruise ship chartered by the Mauritian government, Zola Oskarsson, the Swede leading the survey, said it would take time for tide calculations to be completed. “When we come back to pick up the tide gauges we will be able to work out the reef levels,” he said. “It would have been more fun if we had seen some bird shit, but we didn’t. If you see guano, that’s a sign that a rock is permanently above water.” He added: “There was a spot where I could stand on the sandy bottom with my head above the water. When you are measuring a reef, living coral doesn’t count: it would be like using the top of a tree to record a mountain height. But dead coral is OK. That counts.”",News/World news,Mauritius measures reef hoping to lay claim on Chagos Islands,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/13/mauritius-measures-reef-hoping-to-lay-claim-on-chagos-islands
2/13/2022,"The best thing about Sean Holmes’s chaotic production of Hamlet is that George Fouracres, of the sketch group Daphne, speaks with a Black Country accent (his own). Preconceptions about who is entitled to play the prince have been rapidly peeling away. Yet, as always in England, voice prejudice has stuck: the idea that RP is a default position – as if it were itself not an accent – has been hard to dislodge. A Brummie brooder is a good move. The rest, though – pretty much all of it – is violence, to the play. In a visual muddle that overemphasises Hamlet’s isolation, Fouracres is in Doc Martens, Claudius wears doublet and hose and the Ghost is bare-chested in gladiator kit (glad rags?). Though there is some crispness from Nadi Kemp-Sayfi’s Laertes and John Lightbody’s droll Polonius, most speeches are gabbled, squeaked or given bizarre emphases, as if the rhythm of the lines were something which needed to be clambered over.  The jumble might be justified by the idea that it’s important to punch an audience with the rottenness of Denmark and the raging danger of its heir apparent: Fouracres is furiously defiant, while using his standup skill to rouse the audience into pantomimic exchanges. The trouble is that absolutely nothing matters. The governing mood is of slack facetiousness. “O! That this too too solid flesh would melt” is delivered with the exasperation of someone waiting for British Gas to answer the phone – and was greeted with gales of laughter on press night. Claudius tells Fortinbras to fuck off. Riffing in the gravedigger’s scene – playing his guitar, cracking telly jokes – Ed Gaughan congratulates the audience on sticking it out for so long. Have we, he wonders, in a line that is a true hostage to fortune, got “Stockholm syndrome”? More like Elsinore ennui.

2/13/2022,"Time’s passing has done little to dim the horror of the 1966 Aberfan disaster, in which thousands of tonnes of coal waste thundered down a mountainside and engulfed a Welsh junior school. The sentiments it so powerfully evokes inform the opening of Jo Browning Wroe’s debut novel, A Terrible Kindness, which begins as hope of finding survivors dwindles. Responding to the appeal for help, newly qualified undertaker William Lavery, 19, loads a hearse with embalming fluids and heartbreakingly small coffins, and drives through the night from his Uncle Robert’s Midlands funeral home. There are still 140 bodies to rescue, most of them children, and the scenes he witnesses are captured in a sequence of crisply etched images, some plucked from history, others from the author’s imagination.  Returning home, William finds himself prone to bad dreams and flashbacks. The experience solidifies something for him: never will he let himself become a parent – though when he tries to break things off with his cockney girlfriend, Gloria, she’s having none of it. And yet what really undid William in Aberfan was hearing the strains of Allegri’s Miserere playing on a radio. The music unlocked a memory he has fought to suppress, transporting him back to Cambridge where, five years previously, his career as a boy chorister came to an ignominious end amid a flurry of red tulip petals. It’s a scene – and it really is a scene – whose cause is rooted still further back, in his father’s death when he was just eight years old, and in subsequently worsening tensions between his insecure, grieving mother and her late husband’s gay twin brother. But there’s also the question of why William hasn’t spoken to his best friend, Martin, in half a decade. He turns out to be carrying a great deal of baggage for one so young, and it’s unpacked in a thoughtful period drama that skips confidently between his childhood and early adulthood, revealing that while, yes, he’s been dealt a lousy hand, he has also, as Gloria puts it, been a “big pillock”. Or as Martin more measuredly tells him: “You can’t bear anything to be more than one story.” This well-crafted tale contains many joys, the least expected its meticulous evocation of the hidden world of undertaking, with its clannish decorum. Browning Wroe can’t resist a scene in which William embalms to a soundtrack of Build Me Up Buttercup. Most of the music that flows through these pages is choral, however, striking a note of welcome profundity and counterbalancing the novel’s perkier attributes, such as Gloria’s simple loveliness, or the sustaining bond that Uncle Robert forges with his life partner despite living in an era of unchecked homophobia. But what does it mean to hitch such upbeat fiction to a real-life tragedy? It’s a qualm the novel itself acknowledges, albeit indirectly. Before its close, William returns to the Welsh village and is confounded to find that it hasn’t remained trapped in the moment in quite the same way as a part of himself has. Aberfan, he realises, is more than one “story”, and it’s not his to use when explaining his own.  A Terrible Kindness by Jo Browning Wroe is published by Faber (£14.99).

2/13/2022,"It would be nice if the kids were grateful for us looking after them. This isn’t just about improving family relations in the here and now; ideally, they’d be so grateful that they’d be happy to look after us when the incontinence starts to kick in. An interesting new paper considers that thought pattern in the context of child labour in developing countries.  This is largely a story about farming, with 70% of child labour happening in agriculture. The authors note that evidence doesn’t show the clear pattern we might expect of rising incomes leading to a fall in child labour. In Pakistan and Ghana, research shows land-rich families using more child labour than land-poor ones, while in the coffee-growing regions of Brazil higher incomes have led to more children working. Why might this be? The authors suggest it’s partly because decisions about whether children should work are shaped by the interaction between the need for money today (encouraging child labour) and desire for care in old age (discouraging it). To look after us later requires children to feel gratitude that, shockingly, may not materialise if their childhood included hard labour. The authors suggest the relationship between a parent’s wage and the intensity of child labour is U-shaped: parents with low wages need their child to work, those on middle incomes don’t put their children to work (they can afford not to and want gratitude/care in old age) while high-earning parents are fine for them to work (they don’t need support in old age). I think the big lesson is we should think twice about getting the kids to wash up if we want them to wash us in future.  Torsten Bell is chief executive of the Resolution Foundation.
