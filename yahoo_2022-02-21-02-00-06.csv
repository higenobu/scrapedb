2/21/2022,"Jessica Ann Mitchell Aiwuyor is the founder of the National Black Cultural Information Trust. Aiwuyor uses her TikTok account to educate her followers on Black history by debunking myths, recounting little-known facts and discussing the importance of historical remembrance. “We don’t move forward by ignoring slavery,” Aiwuyor said in a video. “Once we recognize what happened to us, that helps us move forward. We learn the ethnicities of ancestors. We learn their traditions. We make those connections better because now we know more about the people that were enslaved and the systems used to enslave them.” In another video, she debunked “fake Black history” to show how “easily misinformation can become history.” “The Willie Lynch Letter is fake,” she explained. “There’s absolutely no historical record of this person ever even existing.” An enslaver by the name of Willie Lynch was to have allegedly written a pamphlet that widely circulated. In it, the letter supposedly gave instructions to Virginia enslavers on how to use brutality to control enslaved people. But there is no evidence that such a person ever existed. “Sojourner Truth never said, ‘Ain’t I a woman.’ That was never a part of her speech,” Aiwuyor said. “That was a part of a fictitious account that was rewritten 12 years later after her actual speech by a white woman abolitionist.” Sojourner Truth, the first person to successfully sue the courts for illegally enslaving her 5-year-old son, never spoke with a Black Southern accent. She was from New York and spoke Dutch and English. “Jesse Jackson did not create the term ‘African American.’ He’s not even responsible for popularizing the term,” Aiwuyor said. “That was a Black woman activist Ramona Edelin.” The term actually dates back to the 1700s. Activist and educator Ramona Edelin, who also founded the first African American Studies program at Northeastern University in 1972, popularized the term.

2/21/2022,"Finnish President Sauli Niinistö said Sunday that he's recently seen changes in Russian President Vladimir Putin's behavior, saying that he now sounds more ""decisive"" than in the past. Niinistö, who has been in close contact with Putin, recalled an exchange the two shared on the phone. During one of the regular calls, Niinistö said he pushed back against Putin by standing up for his country’s sovereignty. That is when Putin switched tones, he said, then began to “officially” read his list of demands. “That was a change in his behavior, and I want to guess, and from that I guess that he wants to be very decisive, wants to sound like one. It was a different kind of behavior,” he said during an interview on CNN’s ""State of the Union."" For decades, Finland has kept a delicate balance in its relationship with Russia, having been invaded by the Soviet Union in 1939. The country, which borders Russia, stayed scrupulously neutral throughout the Cold War, becoming neither part of the Warsaw Pact nor of NATO. That delicate balance, however, might be tipped if Russia were to invade Ukraine, which President Joe Biden and others throughout the West have painted as an imminent threat. While Niinistö emphasized his country wasn’t planning on a dramatic change in its relationship with Russia, he suggested Russia’s actions are making Finnish people rethink joining NATO. ""A lot depends, also, what actually happens in Ukraine and how Russia is going to behave after that,"" he said. ""If Russia sees a success story for them, that makes them more dangerous."" However, he emphasized that Finland doesn’t feel threatened by Russia as of now. “Finland is a stable democracy. We are a member of the European Union and part of the West,” he said. “We are not afraid of Russian tanks suddenly crossing the Finnish border.”

2/21/2022,"Two skydivers came crashing to the ground during a tandem jump after both the main and backup parachutes malfunctioned, Texas police told news outlets. Both jumpers, a skydiving instructor and a client, survived the fall with serious injuries, the Waller County Sheriff’s Department told KVUE. The instructor was in “very critical” condition when the pair was flown by helicopter to a hospital on Saturday, Feb. 19, according to the outlet. The skydivers landed in a residential area in the town of Waller, about 30 miles northeast of Houston. Alex Arias, a neighborhood resident, told KPRC he saw the primary chute fail and the secondary chute deploy only partially, sending the skydivers plummeting like a “corkscrew.” He ran over to help the jumpers, who were still clipped to one another, he told the outlet. The instructor was unconscious but the client was awake. “She was like, ‘Make it stop, make it stop, make it stop. Get him off of me. Make it stop.’ And I was like ‘You’re ok, you’re ok’ and I’m telling the other dude, ‘Hey wake up, wake up’ and he was out,” Arias said. The jump was conducted through Skydive Houston, located in Waller, the sheriff’s department told the Houston Chronicle. McClatchy News has reached out to Skydive Houston for comment.
