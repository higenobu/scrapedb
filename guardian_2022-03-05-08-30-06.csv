3/5/2022,"A Sky News crew has been evacuated back to the UK from Ukraine after journalists were shot during an ambush by a suspected Russian “death squad” on Monday. The team of five were attacked while out in a car, after unsuccessfully trying to visit the town of Bucha near Kyiv. Chief correspondent with Sky News, Stuart Ramsay, along with camera operator Richie Mockler were shot – Ramsay in the lower back while Mockler took two rounds in his body armour. Footage broadcast by the news organisation shows them approaching a junction when the car starts to be shot at. Initially, according to an account by Ramsay, they thought that it was a Ukrainian army checkpoint firing at them – and they can be heard shouting that they are journalists and asking for their attackers to stop. The crackle of gunfire can be heard and the flash of bullets flying past their car can be seen, as the attack was captured on camera. “I do recall wondering if my death was going to be painful,” Ramsay said, recounting the moments before he was shot. “But what amazed me was that [being shot] didn’t hurt that bad. It was more like being punched, really.” Eventually the group, including producers Martin Vowles and Dominique Van Heerden, as well as local producer Andrii Lytvynenko managed to escape from the car and jump down an embankment at the side of the road. They eventually found refuge in a nearby garage, and were rescued under the cover of darkness hours later by Ukrainian police. The journalists were later told that the gunmen were a saboteur Russian reconnaissance squad. “It was professional, the rounds kept smashing into the car - they didn’t miss,” Ramsay said. He added: “We were very lucky. But thousands of Ukrainians are dying, and families are being targeted by Russian hit squads just as we were, driving along in a family saloon and attacked. “This war gets worse by the day.”",News/World news,British journalists shot by Russian saboteur ‘death squad’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/british-journalists-shot-by-russian-saboteur-death-squad
3/5/2022,"Four days ago Tasmanians Rachel Lehmann Ware and her husband, Duncan, received the call. They had spent the past few nights in the basement of the school they worked in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital at the heart of the Russian invasion. The couple and another teacher had 30 minutes to get to the other side of the city. It was their only hope to get out. “I don’t know what the CEO did to get them, but he got us seats on the train and it’s almost impossible. We had 30 minutes to get there,” Lehmann Ware said. “We got there with literally 30 seconds to go. The driver, he was screeching down the streets of Kyiv.” The couple is now safely in Chernivtsi, a city in western Ukraine that is acting as a short-term haven for people trying to cross the border to Romania or Moldova. Lehmann Ware and her husband are from Huonville in Tasmania. They have spent the past five years teaching in different countries – in July last year, they moved to Kyiv and fell in love with the vibrant city. As war rumours swirled, they were reluctant to leave their school community. Just as the Russians were about to advance on the country, the couple caught Covid. “Dfat called us, they asked when were you diagnosed. [We told them] and they went ‘oh shit’. We didn’t have an option. We could not get out because we had Covid.” With their two cats, the pair bunkered down in the school basement with other members of the staff. They planned to leave by car before it became too unsafe. Each night was interrupted with the sound of explosions as Russian missiles were shot down. Some made it through. No one slept. A 64km convoy of Russian tanks and armoured vehicles had just been spotted advancing up the road to the capital. Military analysts said it was poised to attack. They weren’t sure when they would leave the basement, or what state their city would be in when they did. Then the phone rang. “One of our security guards got us out, I can’t even remember what day it was. He’s now in the militia,” Lehmann Ware said. Although the station was packed with people – many of them trying desperately to get out of the city – there was still a sense of community, she said. People wanted to help each other. “I was going through the front door, I had lost my party, I was holding my massive cat, Dexter, and a young man from nowhere came up to me, he could see I was panicked, he said ‘Everything is OK, you’re going to be OK’,” she said. Lehmann Ware found her husband but, at the top of the stairs, they got separated in the crowd. There were people everywhere. He yelled at her to go, so she ran to the train. She got on, and out of the blue, their security guard arrived, almost carrying her husband with him. “He literally had about 30 seconds to get on the train, that was it,” she said. On the train, the windows were blacked out for security. Through a crack she watched as they passed bombed villages. The carriage was filled with women and children who had had to leave their husbands behind. “No Ukrainian men, no men, they have to stay. You have little kids and their mothers travelling alone and getting to a border,” she said. “It ended up being an 18-hour train journey on a very, very, very old train. One of the really old Soviet trains. Eighteen hours and the train is just overloaded, people in the hallways with kids, dogs, cats, most people got out Lviv – that’s a major transport hub.” The pair and their two cats are now safe in a hotel. There’s fresh coffee and stable wifi. Back home her parents and 21-year-old daughter are finally sleeping with their phones on silent. Everyone is in shock. “My God I’m exhausted. At the moment, to be honest, I think those of us who are here are suffering from survivors’ guilt. You’re happy you’re here and safe but terrified for the people you’ve left behind. “One of my assistant teachers, I haven’t heard from her since Friday. I feel bad for not being there with them.” In the first seven days of the war, one million people fled Ukraine. UN high commissioner for refugees Filippo Grandi said that in 40 years of working in refugee emergencies, he had rarely seen an exodus as quick as this one. “Hour by hour, minute by minute, more people are fleeing the terrifying reality of violence. Countless have been displaced inside the country,” he said. The borders are busy and the west of the country is covered in snow – making lining up to get over the border a hard task. “It’s snowing and cold. We’ve got these children lining up for five to 20 hours, however long it’s taking. It’s horrendous,” she said. “Dfat and Australian crisis support group have been amazing. They’re in constant contact and all of them have said they’ll be there ready for us. Lehmann Ware and her husband are still working out what to do – how to get home. “We make a plan it doesn’t work, we just don’t know, we are hoping to get across tomorrow but we just don’t know. “It’s so important the world knows what’s happening here.”",News/World news,‘He literally had 30 seconds’: an Australian couple’s desperate fight to flee Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/05/he-literally-had-30-seconds-an-australian-couples-desperate-fight-to-flee-ukraine
3/5/2022,"Jürgen Klopp has raised the prospect of staying at Liverpool beyond 2024 by admitting his energy levels will determine how long he remains in the job. The Liverpool manager was caught out by a question on his future before Wednesday’s FA Cup win over Norwich and said he did not know whether to extend a contract that has just over two years remaining. On Friday the 54-year-old reiterated it was still his intention to stay until 2024 – when he will have been in charge for almost nine years, the longest stint of his managerial career – and said a decision on whether to extend his deal could be taken at the “last minute”. Klopp, asked what would persuade him to stay or walk away in two years’ time, replied: “If I have the energy levels for it. That is important. I love what I do but I’ve said a couple of times there must be something else out there in the world, to be honest, apart from always thinking about properly skilled, good-looking, fantastically nice football players. “But I really don’t think about it. At the moment I am full of energy but we have to – I have to – make sure that is the case because I don’t want to sit around and be more tired than others and think: ‘Wow, why is everyone bothered about the things out there because I couldn’t care less?’” Liverpool remain in the hunt for an unprecedented quadruple and Klopp maintains the long-term health of the club – with young players coming through and several redevelopment plans delivered – is more important than his personal plan. “My future will be OK,” he said. “I don’t have to plan. I could book [extend his contract] last minute – let’s put it like this. It is not a problem. No, the plan is the future of the club that we are constantly working on, that everything is in place and the things we do are not for me, not for us, not for this generation, they are for a long, long time. “So many things we’ve tried to improve over the years. It’s about just doing the right things, employing the right people, putting them in the right positions. It doesn’t mean you win the title, it just means you have the right people for the right job, so use them – and that’s what we try. These people – a lot of them are here at the moment – will be good and it will be fine whenever it will be after I leave. The plan at the moment is to do 2024, thank you very much.”",Sport/Football,Jürgen Klopp could stay at Liverpool beyond 2024 ‘if I have the energy’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/04/jurgen-klopp-could-stay-at-liverpool-beyond-2024-if-i-have-the-energy
