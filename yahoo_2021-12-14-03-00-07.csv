12/14/2021,"""The History Tour,"" by Donald Trump and Bill O'Reilly, began with a spotty crowd on Saturday night. Enough seats were empty that those in the upper decks were ""upgraded"" to lower bowl seats, per the Sun-Sentinel. Local and social media reports showed large sections of the Florida arena empty. Former President Donald Trump and ex-Fox News host Bill O'Reilly's ""The History Tour"" got off to a lackluster start in Florida on Saturday night, according to local reports. After Politico reported that the duo's ticket sales were moving slowly despite booking major sports arenas, the South Florida Sun-Sentinel reported that low attendance forced some late changes at the tour's debut at FLA Live Arena in Sunrise, a city in Broward County about an hour north of Miami. ""Many seats remained empty in the cavernous arena,"" the Sun-Sentinel reported in its recap of the event. ""The top level was closed and ticket buyers were 'upgraded' to the lower bowl."" The top ticket sale price for the tour is a $7,500 ""VIP Meet & Greet Package,"" while the lowest price available is $106, as Insider's Eliza Relman reported in June. Trump on Saturday repeated his line that there was ""love in the air"" during the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, according to the Sun-Sentinel. At another point, he complimented former President Barack Obama, calling him ""smart and sharp,"" according to the Sun-Sentinel, which also reported the crowd breaking out into a ""let's go Brandon"" chant to mock President Joe Biden. Inside the arena in Sunrise, home to the NHL's Florida Panthers, Trump and O'Reilly took a 20-minute break in the middle of the 90-minute show. Attendees who shared their experiences on social media also said the event began an hour later than scheduled. They took a similar pause at Sunday night's show in Orlando at the Amway Center, home to the NBA's Orlando Magic. Crowds lined up early for that show, according to Fox 35 Orlando, but attendees trickled out early during the break. Trump's post-presidency office did not return Insider's request for comment.

12/14/2021,"A federal judge has refused to throw out a key charge against two men accused of storming the U.S. Capitol to obstruct the Electoral College vote certification proceedings, upholding prosecutors' use of a criminal statute that many other riot defendants are charged with violating. U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich ruled on Friday that an obstruction charge applies to the Justice Department's case against Ronald Sandlin and Nathaniel DeGrave. Defense lawyers have asked other judges presiding over Capitol riot cases to dismiss the same charge on related grounds. An indictment charges Sandlin and DeGrave with obstruction of an official proceeding on Jan. 6, when a joint session of Congress convened at the Capitol to certify President Joe Biden's electoral victory. The indictment alleges Sandlin and DeGrave broke the law by stopping or attempting to stop the proceeding from going forward by engaging in disruptive conduct, including assaulting law enforcement officers. In asking Friedrich to dismiss the obstruction count, attorneys for Sandlin and DeGrave argued that Congress’ certification of the electoral results did not constitute an “official proceeding” and that the men did not “obstruct, influence and impede” the proceeding. The judge disagreed, ruling that Congress’ joint session to certify the electoral results constituted an official proceeding under the law. Friedrich also concluded that the obstruction charge covers a broader set of acts than what the defense lawyers contended. “The indictment in this case alleges obstructive acts that fall on the obviously unlawful side of the line,” the judge wrote. However, on Saturday, Friedrich deferred ruling on whether the same obstruction charge applies in a separate case against Guy Reffitt, a Texas man accused of leading a group of rioters up the Capitol steps to confront law enforcement officers. The judge said it is unclear, based on the indictment alone, what actions Reffitt allegedly engaged in to obstruct the congressional proceeding. “For this reason, the Court is inclined to defer ruling on his vagueness challenge until the facts have been established at trial and the jury has had an opportunity to consider that evidence,” Friedrich wrote. The obstruction charge is a felony punishable by a maximum of 20 years imprisonment. Jacob Chansley and Paul Allard Hodgkins, two rioters who pleaded guilty to the same obstruction charge, were sentenced to 41 months and 8 months in prison, respectively. Former President Donald Trump nominated Friedrich to the court in 2017. A day before Trump's Jan. 6 “Stop the Steal” rally, Sandlin and DeGrave drove to Washington, D.C., with two pistols, knives, a stun gun, walkie talkies, bear mace and paramilitary gear, according to prosecutors. The men pushed several Capitol police officers guarding a door to the Capitol rotunda and went to the Senate gallery, where they wrestled with officers to get inside, prosecutors said. John Pierce, an attorney for DeGrave, a Las Vegas resident, declined to comment on the ruling. A lawyer for Sandlin, a Tennessee resident, didn't immediately respond Monday to an email seeking comment. Approximately 700 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the Capitol riot. Donovan Crowl, an Ohio man charged with conspiring to attack the Capitol with other members of the anti-government Oath Keepers, has asked a different judge to throw out the obstruction charge against him. Applying the obstruction statute to somebody like Crowl ""will chill the First Amendment rights of all Americans."" his lawyer, Carmen Hernandez, said in a court filing Monday. Friedrich's ruling on Friday “mentions the First Amendment only once in passing without addressing whether the defendant’s protest activity on January 6 was protected by the First Amendment or the First Amendment implications of stretching the obstruction statutes in a novel manner beyond any application in 100 years of obstruction prosecutions,” Hernandez wrote.",U.S./Associated Press,Judge refuses to toss key charge in Capitol riot case,https://news.yahoo.com/judge-refuses-toss-key-charge-170432615.html
12/14/2021,"Mike Scotto di Frego, co-owner of Brother’s Pizzeria, was attacked and knocked unconscious in his restaurant on Dec. 5., surveillance video shows. As a single dad and a business owner, violent interactions aren’t something he can risk, he said on the restaurant’s Facebook. “I got (jumped) and stomped out til I was unconscious,” Scotto di Frego said. “I have two boys, I’m a single dad. I don’t need this in my life.” Scotto di Frego was punched by another individual when he moved to break up a fight between two girls, he said. Police informed WGHP that the incident happened around 2:30 a.m. Dec. 5. “There were two different patrons with tables in there and somehow an argument started and then, from the argument, a fight began, and then the business owner tried to break things up and he was assaulted,” Winston-Salem Police Sgt. Kevin Bowers told the news station. According to Scotto di Frego’s account of the incident on the pizzeria Facebook page, he was still reeling from the attack the next day and working to figure out what exactly happened. After receiving dozens of supportive comments online, he posted a photo of his face, bruised and swollen, but healing. In the restaurant surveillance video submitted to news outlets, viewers can see Scotto di Frego attempt to speak to customers walking by him toward a group of people in the back of the restaurant. The video shows one man come up behind Scotto di Frego and hit him in the side of the head, causing him to fall into a booth. The same man appears to stomp on him once he has fallen down, the video shows. Following the incident, Scotto di Frego and his business partner decided to permanently close the restaurant early at night in response to violence in the pizzeria. “I’m sorry to announce this, but due to recent incidents in the store we will no longer be open late nights,” they wrote. Now, their restaurant will begin to close at 10 p.m. except for Saturday, when it will close at midnight. It will cost them money, the pizzeria told News & Record, but it’s not worth the risk. Merchants told the outlet that officers on downtown patrol are off by midnight, leaving a scarce law enforcement presence by the time late-night venues close. “It’s no secret that we can use more people,” Bowers, the longtime supervisor for the downtown bike patrol, told the News & Record. “Every department could.” Kira Boyd, spokesperson for the Winston-Salem Police Department, told McClatchy News that safety concerns for downtown business owners are a priority for the department. “We encourage citizens to report any crimes they witness in our city,” Boyd said. “We will be meeting with a group of business owners soon to discuss ways we can partner to keep their patrons and our citizens safe.” If citizens have any information about the incident, they are asked to call the Winston-Salem Police Department at 336-773-7700.

12/14/2021,"Amy Cooper notoriously called police and made false claims against Central Park bird watcher Christian Cooper, a Black man. In an Instagram post this weekend, Tina Knowles-Lawson questioned if actor Jussie Smollett would receive “the same compassion” shown to Amy Cooper, who notoriously called police and made false claims against Black Central Park bird watcher Christian Cooper in May 2020. Knowles-Lawson shared a screenshot of a CNN opinion piece written by Issac Bailey titled, “What Jussie Smollett’s guilty verdicts tell us.” Bailey is a college professor and the author of Why Didn’t We Riot? A Black Man in Trumpland. In her post, Knowles-Lawson wrote, “The article goes on to say both were wrong but Jussie faces possible prison time and Amy Cooper the woman who called the police and lied about the black man that was Bird watching in Central Park was trying to attack her. Leading to the arrest of the man where in the history of black men In Custody could have led to his death!!” “Amy Cooper got off with public service,” Knowles-Lawson adds. “We will see the outcome of this for this Black man. Will he get the same compassion as Amy Cooper? I am not condoning what Mr Smollet was found guilty of. I am just asking will he get the same compassion and understanding of knowingly lying to police. Kyle Rittenhouse walked free after killing two people because the jury had compassion?” Cooper faced a single misdemeanor charge of falsely reporting an incident after her encounter with the Black bird watcher who requested she leash her dog in a part of Central Park where leashes are required. She was captured on video accentuating her pleas to 911 asking for help and saying the Black man was potentially a threat to her. The incident occurred early in the coronavirus pandemic and quickly became national news. Cooper’s charges were ultimately dismissed after she completed a “therapeutic” program. Smollett was accused of staging his own assault in January 2019, when he told police that two men put a noose around his neck, poured bleach on him and hurled racist and homophobic slurs at him, shouting, “This is MAGA country.” The former Empire star has been found guilty of five felony counts of disorderly conduct for making false reports to the police and is facing a maximum penalty of three years in prison. In his CNN article, Bailey writes, “It’s hard for me to think of Jussie Smollett without thinking of Amy Cooper. They each did something horrifically stupid and dangerous, echoing the worst of this country’s racial history for their own selfish reasons.” “And let’s be frank,” he continues. “Even though he is a wealthy celebrity, and she was unknown to most Americans before she was launched into the public eye through viral infamy, it’s not particularly surprising that it is the Black man who might lose his freedom while the White woman might parlay her false claim into a payday by suing her former employer, claiming she was a victim of racial discrimination.” Have you subscribed to theGrio podcasts “Dear Culture” or “Acting Up?” Download our newest episodes now!TheGrio is now on Apple TV, Amazon Fire and Roku.

12/14/2021,"Scientists say they finally have an explanation for a mystifying, bright blue light that came from deep in space. Three years ago, astronomers were stunned to see a bright blue flash that came out of the spiral arm of a distant galaxy, some 200 million light-years away. The initial detection of the event known as AT2018cow happened in June 2018, when it was seen by a survey in Hawaii, which quickly sent out global alerts to tell other telescopes to look towards it. They saw a bright flash 100 times brighter than the usual supernova, the brightest explosion humanity has seen. It looked like a supernova, but it was even brighter and faster than those already extreme events. Scientists struggled to explain it, and it became known as a fast blue optical transient, or FBOT, with no explanation of how it happened. Further detail on the event only seemed to make it more puzzling. Scientists found that it consisted not only of the bright flash of light, but also pulsing and powerful X-rays, with hundreds of millions of such pulses being traced back to the same object. Those pulses happened regularly, every 4.4 miliseconds, over a period of 60 days. Scientists used those pulses to calculate that the source of the X-rays must be no more than 1,000 kilometres wide, and have a mass less than 800 suns. That would seem to suggest that it is something compact, such a small black hole or a neutron star. As such, it appears that the mystifying flash probably happened as a star was dying – as it collapsed, it gave birth to a baby black hole or neutron star. That went onto eat the material that surrounded it, swallowing up the star, releasing intense bursts of energy as it went. That is the conclusion presented in a new paper, ‘Evidence for a Compact Object in the Aftermath of the Extra-Galactic Transient AT2018cow’, published in Nature Astronomy. “We have likely discovered the birth of a compact object in a supernova,” says lead author Dheeraj “DJ” Pasham, a research scientist at MIT. “This happens in normal supernovae, but we haven’t seen it before because it’s such a messy process. We think this new evidence opens possibilities for finding baby black holes or baby neutron stars.” Previous attempts to explain the flash have suggested that it could be a black hole being born in a supernova, or a star ripping the material from another passing star. But astronomers have never been able to satisfactorily explain the flash using only optical data – which led the researchers behind the new paper to look at the X-ray energy too. That led them to examine the regular pulses, which could be used to learn more about the object that was sending them. That ruled out an intermediate black hole and led scientists to the current explanation, they said. The same techniques could be used to help better understand other fast blue optical transients in the same family, scientistssay. “Whenever there’s a new phenomenon, there’s excitement that it could tell something new about the universe,” Pasham says. “For FBOTs, we have shown we can study their pulsations in detail, in a way that’s not possible in the optical. So, this is a new way to understand these newborn compact objects.” Read More Scientists take astonishing picture of planet they thought couldn’t exist How to see geminid meteor shower in the sky tonight Supermassive black hole in the Milky Way has a ‘leak’, Nasa says How to see geminid meteor shower in the sky tonight Supermassive black hole in the Milky Way has a ‘leak’, Nasa says Elon Musk named Time Person of the Year",Science/The Independent,Scientists finally have explanation for incredibly bright light that came from deep in space,https://news.yahoo.com/scientists-finally-explanation-incredibly-bright-160441818.html
12/14/2021,"KIBBUTZ YAHEL, Israel (Reuters) - The southern tip of Israel is a rocky desert where solar panels are abundant and the sun, when shining, is the source of nearly all electricity. Once it sets, however, the grid shifts back to fossil fuels to generate power. Renewable energy from solar and wind powered systems cannot be stored without extra cost - a major obstacle in the world's efforts to tear itself away from polluting fuels and avoid a climate catastrophe. But at Kibbutz Yahel, a small community not far from the Red Sea where a sweet variety of dates called Medjool is grown, residents have started using a new technology that can store solar energy cheaply and produce power well into the night. During the day, excess energy from solar panels drive a system where water is used to condense air in underground tanks. After sundown that air is released to power a turbine and generate electricity. And the cycle repeats in the morning. ""Other kibbutzim are waiting and watching to see if this works, and certainly it could become the green energy storage solution for the area,"" said Yossi Amiel, Yahel's business manager. The system was developed by Augwind Energy, a company traded in Tel Aviv with a market cap of 1.2 billion shekels ($386 million). Unlike above-ground platforms that work with condensed air and require significant real estate, the company says its product, a relatively thin steel tank with a special polymer lining, can be placed right at the power source and at a lower cost. A range of techniques are being explored to store energy, like pumped-hydro systems that use gravity to generate electricity after hours, lithium ion batteries like those in electric cars, and storing energy in chemical form, like hydrogen. An ideal solution has been elusive, said Gideon Friedman, acting Chief Scientist at Israel's Energy Ministry. Batteries can be toxic and their cycles are limited, he said, while hydrogen is still early stage and too expensive. Augwind's 'AirBattery' is about 80% efficient in storing energy, a bit less than batteries, but unlike batteries it does not degrade over time. ""It's really a matter of cost versus the competition of batteries, whether this system can compete in cost. If they can, we will see, I expect, quite a number of these. Certainly there are a few projects already planned,"" Friedman said. Augwind CEO Or Yogev says the price is on par with lithium ion batteries, roughly $250 per kilowatt hour, and that it will drop next year to below $200 as they roll out to more customers. The company has so far raised $60 million from institutional investors, he said. ""Over the next few years we're going to have thousands of megawatt hours installed using the 'AirBattery' technology. That's our prediction,"" Yogev said. ""Even that, when you compare that to the size of the market, it's still pretty small.""
