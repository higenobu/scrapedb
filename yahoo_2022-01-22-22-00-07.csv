1/22/2022,"The fate of the Capitol on the day of the insurrection, some White House insiders believed, rested on the slender shoulders of Ivanka Trump. As President Trump watched the mayhem unfold on Jan. 6, 2021, unwilling to intervene, it became clear to those around him that there was only one person on Earth who could get him to call off the dogs: his elder daughter. One can only wonder what might have happened if she hadn’t interceded. After all, it took him several hours to ask the rioters to knock it off. And even then, he did not seem particularly upset about the bloodshed and violence. “Go home,” he told them in a recorded video. “We love you, you’re very special.” On Thursday, Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), chairman of the bipartisan House committee investigating Jan. 6, invited Ivanka to testify about what she knew in advance and what she saw, heard and did on that awful day. She is the first Trump family member to be asked. In an eight-page letter crammed with juicy details about what the committee has learned so far, Thompson politely extended the invitation. “We respect your privacy,” he wrote, “and our questions will be limited to issues related to January 6th, the activities that contributed to or influenced events … and your role in the White House during that period.” Of course they need to hear from Ivanka; she was in the room where it happened. As advisor to the president and head of the White House Office of Economic Initiatives and Entrepreneurship, Ivanka was the Zelig of the Trump administration. She was everywhere, popping into view for photo ops with world leaders, ducking out of sight when the heat was on and ludicrously taking credit, by her father’s insane estimation, for creating 14 million jobs. None of Trump's staff, apparently, had enough juice to get him to act on Jan. 6: “He didn’t say yes to [Chief of Staff] Mark Meadows or [spokeswoman] Kayleigh McEnany or [presidential advisor] Keith Kellogg, but he might say yes to his daughter?” a committee member asked Kellogg when he testified. “Exactly right,” replied Kellogg, who was also the vice president’s national security advisor. Ivanka was right there when Trump put the screws on Pence to get him to toss out, or at least delay counting, the electoral votes of some states that Biden won. So far, Ivanka, who has lain low after her twice-impeached father left office, has not publicly responded to the committee’s invitation. I suppose that’s understandable. She had her hands full last week. On Tuesday, two days before Thompson’s invitation landed, New York Atty. Gen. Letitia James, who has been investigating the Trump Organization’s alleged financial chicanery, filed a detailed legal memo in state court, explaining why Ivanka, her brother Donald Trump Jr. and her father cannot refuse to respond to her subpoenas requiring them to testify about the family business. They have preposterously claimed that her lawfully issued subpoenas, served Dec. 1, constitute an “unprecedented and unconstitutional maneuver.” But, as James wrote in the filing, subpoenas to top and former company officials are “routine in complex financial investigations and are amply warranted here.” Eric Trump, noted James, has already testified, and invoked his 5th Amendment privilege multiple times not to incriminate himself. (What was it that Donald Trump once said about taking the 5th? Oh, yes: “The mob takes the 5th. If you’re innocent, why are you taking the 5th Amendment?”) It is not yet clear what is at stake in the New York investigation, but reams upon reams of documents procured by investigators show a family that appears to have wildly inflated the value of assets when it was convenient. James has not yet decided whether she will take “civil remedial action” against the Trumps, but her office, she wrote in the court documents, “has developed significant … evidence indicating that the Trump Organization used fraudulent or misleading asset valuations to obtain a host of economic benefits, including loans, insurance coverage, and tax deductions.” Why should Ivanka be worried? Because, as James notes in a second memo, also filed Tuesday, she was the Trump firm’s executive vice president for development and acquisition through at least 2016, and until January 2017 was “a primary contact” for the company’s largest lender, Deutsche Bank. She has skated on thin legal ice before; in 2012, Ivanka and her older brother, Don Jr., narrowly avoided being charged with felony fraud after they misled prospective condo buyers about how well units were selling in a project called Trump SoHo. Manhattan Dist. Atty. Cyrus Vance Jr. overruled his own prosecutors when he decided not to prosecute. I admit, my eyes did go a little crossed as I read through the 115-page memo, which showed wild and improbable fluctuations in the value of various assets in the financial statements the Trump Organization prepared for its lenders. One example out of dozens: The Trumps claimed a value of $161 million for property in Westchester County that had been appraised at between $29 million and $50 million. Apparently, they based the inflated value on un-permitted, unbuilt construction that had been, as they put it, “put on hold.” It’s been comforting to watch the air of invincibility around the Trumps crumble. In the same week that Ivanka was in the spotlight for various alleged Trump family misdeeds, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to stay an order forcing the National Archives to turn over Trump White House documents to the House Jan. 6 committee. And in another blow, the district attorney of Fulton County, Ga., asked that a special grand jury look into Trump’s efforts to wheedle Georgia’s secretary of state into falsely claiming Trump had won the state in 2020. Will the Trumps finally face the consequences of their bad behavior? Fingers crossed. @AbcarianLAT This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",Politics/Los Angeles Times Opinion,"Abcarian: Ivanka Trump wanted to be at the center of it all.

1/22/2022,"When Donald Trump announced plans in 2006 to build a golf complex on ancient sand dunes on the Aberdeenshire coast in Scotland he told reporters it was love at first sight. “As soon as I saw it there was no question about it,” he said. It would be the world’s “greatest golf course”. This week Trump International Scotland became a central element of a case that looks poised to dominate his post-presidential life, and could even put him behind bars. Local fishermen denounced Trump as a “loudmouth bully” during construction of the course. Environmentalists warned the development would destroy the natural habitat, and sure enough it did inflict such damage that the site was stripped of its protected status. But none of this deflected Trump from his goal. Today, the Scottish complex stands as a “premier luxury golf” experience replete with five-star hotel and helicopter landing pad, at a bargain membership of £2,595 ($3,518) a year. Fifteen years on, the property has done wonders for its owner. That is, if you measure success according to the idiosyncratic accounting style of Donald Trump. He bought the 2,000 acres (809 hectares) site at Menie in 2006 for $12.6m. Within five short years it was valued by the Trump Organization in its financial statements at $161m, an increase of almost 13 times. By 2014, the windswept Scottish holding was put at $436m. The hike caught the attention of Letitia James, New York state’s progressive attorney general known for her relentless pursuit of the rich and powerful. How the Scottish property came to rise meteorically in value is one of the matters she is exploring in her continuing investigation into Trump Organization finances. In a new filing released this week designed to pressure Trump and two of his children – Ivanka and Donald Jr – into facing questioning, James forensically dissects how such strikingly large valuations came about. The 2011 estimate for the Scottish property, her investigators discovered, included an estimated £75,000 ($120,000 at 2011 exchange rates) for undeveloped land at the site. Investigating deeper, they found that the figure had been created for an article in Forbes magazine. The revelation prompted a line in this week’s filing that must be among the tartest in US financial history. “It thus appears,” James writes, “that the valuation of Trump Aberdeen used for Mr Trump’s financial statement was prepared for purposes of providing information to Forbes magazine in a quote.” James’s legal document is packed with similarly juicy tidbits. The 2014 value of the Scottish golf club was based in part on the projected sale price of 2,500 houses on the land, even though none of the houses actually existed and the company had planning permission for only half that number. In 1995 the Trump Organization bought a parcel of land in Westchester, New York, known as the Seven Springs Estate, for $7.5m. By 2004 it was valued at $80m and by 2014 at $291m. That 2014 figure, James notes in another exquisitely tart reference, included a valuation of $161m for “seven non-existent mansions”. The juiciest tidbit of all concerns Trump’s former home, the gilded Fifth Avenue temple to his own ego dubbed “Versailles in the sky”, in which he lived before moving into the White House. James’s investigators were puzzled to find the Trump Tower triplex in Manhattan was listed at $327m in 2015, based on the apartment’s size, allegedly 30,000 sq feet. In fact the property is 11,000 sq feet, which produces a value of $117m. That’s an overstatement in Trump’s official financial statements of more than $200m. Such startling disparities matter, James insists in her 114-page filing. The financial statements that contained them were used to secure loans from banks as well as insurance, and in other instances to reduce Trump’s tax burden. “We have uncovered significant evidence that suggests Donald J Trump and the Trump Organization falsely and fraudulently valued multiple assets and misrepresented those values to financial institutions for economic benefit,” James said after the filing was lodged in a New York court. The new material disclosed by James was so compelling that some close observers of Trumpland are now convinced that he is in serious legal trouble. Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal attorney and an ex-vice president of the Trump Organization, told the Guardian: “The House of Trump is crumbling.” Cohen, who was released in November from house arrest having had his own legal difficulties, has skin in this game. It was his testimony to the House oversight committee in February 2019 that sounded the alarm over allegedly inflated evaluations in Trump’s financial statements, which in turn prompted James to open her investigation the following month. “My testimony before the committee as well as my subsequent cooperation with the New York attorney general has led to this day,” Cohen said. “We are seeing individuals who have continuously escaped responsibility for their actions finally being held accountable.” James is pursuing her investigation as a civil case, which means that were Trump to be found liable it could cost him heavily in fines and penalties. More seriously, James is working in coordination with the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, a similarly tenacious and relentless prosecutor equipped with a large and highly experienced team of investigators. Bragg is asking exactly the same questions as James: did the Trump Organization commit accounting, bank, tax or insurance fraud? The critical difference is that Bragg’s investigation is criminal, threatening Trump not with fines but prison time. “Trump could end up in an orange jumpsuit at the end of that one,” said Timothy O’Brien, a senior columnist for Bloomberg Opinion. O’Brien also has a personal stake in this story. His book TrumpNation, a 2005 biography that raised doubts about Trump’s actual wealth in eerily similar terms to the James and Bragg investigations today, so irked the real estate developer that he sued O’Brien for billions of dollars. O’Brien’s lawyers deposed Trump as part of his defense. Over two days they managed to do something that has rarely been done before or since – they got the celebrity to acknowledge, no fewer than 30 times, that he had lied. “My lawyers were so well prepared that when he sat down for the deposition we had documentary evidence at hand that showed the reality of what he had lied about or exaggerated. We simply pushed those over the table at him,” O’Brien recalled. Many of the misleading elements – the value of his golf clubs, real estate assets in New York – were virtually identical to the details contained in this week’s filing. Which is why O’Brien feels confident in saying that the patterns that James outlines in her court document extend far back. “This is behaviour that Trump has been engaging with since he was a toddler, frankly,” O’Brien said. The libel suit was dismissed in 2009. The author was surprised that despite the mass of detail he had exposed in TrumpNation of potential malfeasance, no prosecutor showed interest. “There was ample fodder in my book for prosecutors to pursue, but nobody picked it up. Law enforcement simply didn’t take Donald Trump seriously until it was too late.” Times have changed. Trump is no longer a real estate magnate-turned-reality TV star, he is a former US president. The stakes have increased significantly and with them the scrutiny. Never before has Trump been confronted by two coordinated teams of sophisticated investigators raking through his financial affairs, with both civil and criminal charges possibly pending. Just how serious the prosecutors are about nailing their man is revealed in a single sentence of James’s new filing. She writes that the investigative team is determined to find out “Mr Trump’s actual knowledge of – and intention to make – the numerous misstatements and omissions made by him or on his behalf.” “Intention to make” indicates that James is not only thinking along civil lines. She is also anticipating possible criminal charges in which proof of the intent of the accused is required. Trump continues to resist giving testimony, as do his two children, on grounds that the investigations are politically motivated witch hunts (both James and Bragg are Democrats). A third child, Eric, who runs the day-to-day work of the Trump Organization, was deposed but pleaded the fifth more than 500 times. The family’s best hope is that the prosecutors will struggle to meet the high bar that is set for criminal cases. That is especially so when it comes to the critical issue of intent, said Robert Mintz, a former federal prosecutor. “The criminal case is more dangerous since it involves potential incarceration. But it requires criminal intent and that is difficult to prove, particularly in complex financial frauds involving organizations,” Mintz, now a partner at McCarter & English, LLP told the Guardian. Prosecutors will have to prove that Trump knowingly and willfully violated the law. That can be tough – showing discrepancies in financial statements, juicy though they may be, is not enough. “Large investigations take time and are exceedingly difficult to prove without the help of cooperating witnesses and documentation,” Mintz said. “These parallel investigations are clearly moving ahead, but how they will end is difficult to predict.”",Politics/The Guardian,‘House of Trump is crumbling’: why ex-president’s legal net is tightening,https://news.yahoo.com/house-trump-crumbling-why-ex-070048172.html

Or perhaps something he hasn’t said yet? Am I right, Donald?” “Rumor is, you’re still waiting for those magic words from Ron,” the voiceover continues. “Isn’t that so, Donald? But after all this time, if Ron weren’t thinking of challenging you for president, don’t you think he would have told you by now?” Stop him before it’s too late, Donald. pic.twitter.com/tqoeG9j3cb — Remove Ron (@RemoveRon) January 21, 2022 The ad warns Trump, who’s dismissed reports of a souring in tensions between the pair as fake news, that time is running out and that if DeSantis wins re-election as governor, “he’s coming for you.” The Remove Ron group is “dedicated to taking down Ron DeSantis in 2022,” per its Twitter profile. Its chair is Florida “Grim Reaper” lawyer Daniel Uhlfelder, who took to the state’s beaches to protest DeSantis’ catastrophic handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

1/22/2022,"UK health officials estimated the impact of different isolation periods on COVID-19 infectiousness. Five days from symptoms or a positive test, 31% of people with COVID-19 were contagious, they said. Testing negative on rapid tests on days 5 and 6 cut the risk of being infectious to 7%, they said. It's a critical question that has played on the minds of individuals with COVID-19 who want to see friends and relatives again: how long should I isolate for to make sure I'm not contagious? So far, there doesn't seem to be a universally accepted answer. In the US, government rules allow most people to end isolation after five days without having to take a test; that contrasts with the UK, where Brits with COVID-19 can exit at day six but only after testing negative for the last two days of isolation and without a fever. Without a test, they have to wait ten full days. Policymakers have to strike the balance between limiting the advance of the pandemic, while preventing the economy from grinding to a halt. President Biden's chief medical advisor, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said December 28 that US COVID-19 isolation guidelines were designed to ""get people back to jobs."" But some disease experts in both the UK and US have warned that isolation guidance doesn't follow science and risks people inadvertently spreading the virus at work or school, especially if they haven't taken a test. Robert Wachter, a professor and chair of the department of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco said on Twitter January 14, that his son's rapid test was positive at Day 10. ""If we hadn't tested, he'd be on his third day of work,"" he said. The UK Health and Security Agency, which informs UK policy, estimated that almost a third of people with COVID-19 were still contagious five days after symptom onset or a positive test. Only 7% of people who isolated for five days and tested negative on days five and six of isolation were still contagious, according to the models. For comparison, the amount of people infectious after ten days is 5%, the data shows. Gary McLean, a professor of molecular immunology at London Metropolitan University, told Insider that, generally, people with COVID-19 were ""potentially infectious"" from two days before symptoms and up to ten days after. McLean said that there was a good chance of not being infectious anymore if the UK guidance was followed, but it wasn't foolproof. Immunity and the number of virus particles with which they were infected can determine for how long a patient remains infectious, he said. ""Everyone's a bit different,"" he said. The estimates are also not specifically for Omicron infections. Lawrence Young, a virologist and professor of molecular oncology at Warwick University, told Insider at the time of the data release that there wasn't much data on the dynamics of an Omicron infection, compared with other variants. This means we can't predict exactly how infectious someone with Omicron is. Both Young and McLean agreed that the UKHSA data was the ""best available"" to guide what to do if you're not sure whether you're infectious or not, with the caveat it wasn't exact for every case. A study of 21 people found vaccinated people hospitalized with Omicron had peak levels of infectious virus particles three to six days after diagnosis or symptom onset. No infectious virus particles were detected after 10 days, the study authors said. Study from researchers at Exeter University, UK published in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases found 3% of 176 participants carried potentially infectious virus particles at day 10. Some people retained these levels of virus for up to 68 days, they said. The study was carried out before Omicron became the most common variant. Scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that the number of days people were infectious in the community could be cut to almost zero by requiring at least two consecutive days of negative tests. This is regardless of the number of days after initially testing positive. The researchers cautioned that the models used pre-Omicron data. The study hasn't been published or formally scrutinized by other experts in a peer review. Early research from the US suggested both Omicron and Delta infections last about 10 days and people with Omicron have lower peak virus particles levels. The methods used don't necessarily predict infectiousness, James Hay, the study lead from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, cautioned on Twitter.
