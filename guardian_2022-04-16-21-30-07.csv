4/16/2022,"They say rock is dead, but it’s wearing a sequined catsuit, headlining the first night at Coachella and called Harry Styles. At least that’s what he wants you to think. The British musician’s show was, in many ways, tailor-made for the California festival’s return: his last album, 2019’s Fine Line, was surely designed with floppy fedoras and flower crowns in mind with its 70s folk twangs, Canyon Moons and sexy-sad sun-dappled songs about love, lust and regret. But tonight, all the bombast and pomp of a Big Stadium Pop-Rock Show is in flamboyant full force. There’s a brass section! More wailing guitars than a Led Zeppelin B-side! Hip-swivelling! A Prince cover! From the moment that Styles ripples down the spiral staircase without missing a step – and then drops the ostrich he’s wearing on the beat, to reveal his dazzling Freddie Mercury-styled deep V – this is a show dripping in slickness, already honed from his recent tour. Save for some ‘countryside footage’ of rutting bunnies and what looks like the Cotswolds (it is Easter, after all), Styles is also here to show that he is not just a Rock God Reborn but an adopted All American Son. That chest-ripping one-piece is striped in red, white and blue (the rest of his band in blue denim), and he brings out All American Gal Shania Twain for a respectful raunch-off. But back to the beginning. Coachella being the commercial behemoth it is, Styles has a new album to promote (Harry’s House, 20 May) and he starts off by firing his disco rocket with its excellent lead single As It Was (think Robbie Williams, by way of Metronomy, or Joe Jackson). From here, it’s a hi-NRG, muscular set that glides through funk to folk-rock, songs like Adore You, Golden and, of course, Watermelon Sugar, transformed into anthemic festival moments. His largely female band remains in the background until he brings them front of stage for a new song about being jealous of boyfriends (“To boyfriends everywhere, fuck you” is the preamble), during what I’m just going call Harry’s blue balls section. It’s a perfectly fine acoustic number, with quadruple-pronged harmonies, continuing the pretty-ditty leanings of his last album. The ex-girlfriend lament Cherry swiftly follows. Fine Line was criticised, if anything, for lacking substance beneath the Bowie-indebted style, revealing scant detail about one of pop’s biggest male solo artists. But live, it’s clear that the stuff that makes Styles is his gift as a nimble performer. He’s no Freddie Mercury, sure – there are no octave-hurdling Olympics ripping through that nice pop contest voice – but tell that to the people fainting in the front row after all that thrusting. The show goes on late by festival standards – it’s by now way past midnight – but no matter, because soon Styles announces like a teacher at the school prom that there will be “dancing for 12 minutes”, just to keep everyone pepped up. Though Canyon Moon does indeed become a joyous jamboree with a brass band in matching red boilersuits. Part of the fun of Coachella is who gets brought on stage for a guest warble, but Styles keeps it light on surprises. Tonight, he is the spectacle. But the set’s most touching moment is when Twain arrives, rising on the podium like a go-go dancer in dazzling minidress and launching into the campy, bouncy, glammy rock of her world-dominating anthem Man, I Feel Like A Woman. “In the car with my mother as a child, this lady taught me how to sing,” says Styles afterwards, as they sit down on stools to duet You’re Still The One. “She also taught me that men are trash.” But not Styles, right? Late Night Talking, his final new song, is further evidence of a funk-fuelled direction, sounding not unlike Jessie Ware. It’s promising but as yet uncertain whether it reveals more of the man behind the mask. Sorry, sequins. As his Sign O’ The Times cover comes to a delirious close, fireworks shooting overhead, it’s hardly been Beychella but this is the show that suggests Styles is a solid showman, here to stay, sequins and all.",Arts/Music,"Harry Styles at Coachella review – a sexy, sequined genre-bending set",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/16/harry-styles-coachella-review-sexy-sequined-set
4/16/2022,"On day 50 of Russia’s invasion, Volodymyr Zelenskiy made his nightly address to the Ukrainian people. Vladimir Putin had confidently expected to seize Ukraine in five days, Zelenskiy said, standing outside his neo-classical administration building in central Kyiv. Putin was now “making friends with reality”, he added mordantly, hailing the bravery and staunchness of his citizens. There was a reference to Russia’s flagship Moskva, which Ukraine says it audaciously sank last Wednesday with two lethal Neptune missiles. The warship has become a meme and symbol of national defiance, ever since Ukrainian soldiers stationed on Snake Island in the Black Sea told it in the first days of the conflict to “go and fuck yourself”. Zelenskiy avoided the F word. He praised those who “have shown that Russian ships can” – dramatic pause – “go to the bottom of the sea”. He also paid tribute to the men and women who had driven Russian troops from the north, stalled them in the south and heroically defended Mariupol. As usual, he ended his speech with: “Slava Ukraini” – Glory to Ukraine. On the battlefield, Ukraine’s fortunes have been mixed. Russia’s armed units have been forced to withdraw from the Kyiv region after failing to seize the capital. But they have made significant advances along the Sea of Azov, carving a land corridor from Crimea to separatist-controlled territory in the east, where a Russian offensive is imminent. On the information front, however, Ukraine has offered a masterclass in message. Zelenskiy’s speeches to his people, and his addresses to foreign parliaments around the world, have galvanised international support and shored up morale at home. They have been gripping viewing, an unvarnished real-time video blog from Europe’s bloody frontline. The writer of them is a 38-year-old former journalist and political analyst with fewer than 200 followers on Twitter. In an interview conducted via WhatsApp, Dmyro Lytvyn told the Observer the ideas behind the speeches were Zelenskiy’s: “The president always knows what he wants to say, and how he wants to say it.” He added: “In the speeches, emotions are most important. And of course the president is author of emotions and the logic of the words.” Other world leaders “might learn how to do it”. In other words they might emulate Zelenskiy’s punchy combination of frankness and emotional power. Lytvyn is part of the president’s inner team. He and his colleagues have been living and working at Bankova – Ukraine’s equivalent of the White House or Downing Street – since the first days of the invasion. A one-time columnist with the Levyy Bereg weekly news magazine, named after the left bank of the Dnipro River, Lytvyn was reluctant to say more. “I don’t usually comment on this topic,” he said. Serhiy Leshchenko, another former journalist turned wartime Zelenskiy adviser, described Lytvyn as a literary and artistic assistant: “He collects the president’s ideas each day. He works as a mind or sense collector.” One day the theme might be the barbarism of Russian soldiers, the next Ukraine’s urgent need for defensive weapons. Lytvyn has been in the thick of Ukrainian politics for sometime. He was a political analyst for Servant of the People, Zelenskiy’s political party, and a bitter opponent of Petro Poroshenko, Zelenskiy’s predecessor as president. One former colleague said Lytvyn’s attacks on the country’s post-2014 leadership after the pro-European Maidan uprising had split Ukrainian society. “I’m not a fan. But he’s smart,” the colleague added. Writing on Facebook at the beginning of the war, Lytvyn made several shrewd points about Putin. “His imagination is poor, so he always mirrors something … We have to understand that objective reality does not control Putin. The west’s sanctions will not affect him. He seeks isolation.” Putin’s implacable goal was to change the state and Ukraine’s “political reality”, he posted. Lytvyn’s method certainly works. Polls show 95% of Ukrainians believe their country can repel Russia’s invasion, despite Kyiv’s inferiority in terms of tanks, troops and aviation. And 78% believe Ukraine is moving in the right direction. Zelenskiy’s personal ratings, depressed at the beginning of February, have skyrocketed. Orysia Lutsevych, manager of the Ukraine forum at foreign policy thinktank Chatham House, said Zelenskiy’s previous career as an actor and comedian was key to his success. Viewers were used to seeing him in different roles on television and were therefore able to accept him as “commander-in-chief in a T-shirt” – a feat that eludes more conventional politicians. “They know he can transform. He’s like metamorphosis Zelenskiy,” she said. “He’s a modern-day statesman who came from entertainment. He’s in his element. People around him understand the power of narrative during a war. After the horrors of Bucha, it’s important to have a galvanising story. The sinking of the Moskva is a powerful symbol.” Lutsevych said Zelenskiy and his co-writers had created a sense of “historical mission”, which linked Ukraine’s current struggle with previous battles against Moscow. They were also well versed in pop culture, presenting the war as “light versus darkness”. In this Lord of the Rings-style drama, Russian soldiers were “orcs” and Putin an invisible Sauron. Many of Zelenskiy’s senior advisers come from television, and worked with him at Kvartal-95, his production studio. Their attempts to win global support are helped by the clear-cut nature of Russia’s invasion. Ukraine is the victim. It is fighting for survival. This makes Zelenskiy the leader of what political scientist Ivan Krastev calls a “romantic constellation”. Zelenskiy is at ease in front of a camera, whether speaking into his iPhone or addressing citizens from his bunker. When he was elected in 2019, he had few concrete political ideas. He tried to distinguish himself from his predecessors by giving lengthy press conferences. These days, his interactions are snappier. Lutsevych said his daily speeches “resonate well”. They are also immaculately tailored to particular audiences. Addressing the House of Commons on day 13 of the invasion, Zelenskiy likened Ukraine’s struggle against Russia to Great Britain’s against Hitler. “We will fight until the end, at sea, in the air. We will continue fighting for our land, whatever the cost … We will fight in the forests, in the fields, on the shores, in the streets.” For Brits, then, Zelenskiy invoked Churchill. For the Greek parliament it was Mariupol – home to many ethnic Greeks – and for the Finns, Molotov cocktails, hurled against Soviet invaders. Speaking to Australians, Zelenskiy cited MH17, the Malaysian Airlines plane shot down by Russia in 2014. Talking to the US Congress, he likened the bombardment of Ukraine to Pearl Harbor and 9/11. Zelenskiy matches this lofty rhetoric with concrete requests. He has called for Ukraine to be given anti-aircraft systems, MiG fighter jets, tanks, and armoured vehicles. He wants further sanctions against Moscow, including a complete oil embargo. At times he can be reproving. Germany’s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, was told last week not to visit Kyiv because of his close ties to Russia. Ihor Todorov, professor of international relations at Uzhhorod university in western Ukraine, said Zelenskiy could be emotional and undiplomatic. His early presidency often resembled Servant of the People, the hit Ukrainian TV sitcom where Zelenskiy played a history teacher who becomes president by accident. The war transformed Zelenskiy, as it did Stalin in 1941, he said. “Zelenskiy has responded well to the situation,” he said. “A lot of people who didn’t vote for him two years ago recognise this.” He added that the president’s wife, Olena, had much to do with the passionate tone of his addresses, and that other people were also involved, including Yuri Kostyuk, one of the scriptwriters on Servant of the People. So is Zelenskiy Ukraine’s answer to Churchill? No, said Tordorov: “To compare Zelenskiy to the cult of Winston is too much.” Lutsevych agreed. “Churchill was a lot more charismatic and ego-driven,” she said. “But Zelenskiy is quite effective.”",News/World news,How Zelenskiy’s team of TV writers helps his victory message hit home,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/16/zelenskiy-ukraine-war-writers-journalists
4/16/2022,"This soulful, heavy hearted drama tells a tale of gentrification and community displacement in Cambodia. It’s a fictional story about the real-life White Building, an iconic modernist apartment block built in 1963 in the centre of Phnom Penh and demolished in 2017. The film’s director, Kavich Neang, has a personal connection: he grew up in the White Building and opens his film with an extraordinary drone shot that floats above the building’s roof. From this angle the mosaic of chipped tiles and rusted corrugated sheets looks strangely beautiful: a metaphor perhaps for the White Building itself, which is crumbling and not fit for habitation, but still home to a vibrant diverse community, everyone happily jostling in the corridors. Neang’s story is about a boy’s coming of age as his family is evicted. Piseth Chhun gives a sensitive performance as Nang, who at the start of the movie, bleached streaks in his hair, dreams of boyband-style fame with his hip-hop dance squad, which is basically him and two mates. He lives with his mum and sculptor dad in the building, whose residents are being pushed out so property developers can move in. The miserably low payoff will force most of them out of the city, where house prices are skyrocketing. The film follows Nang as he matures from boy to man. His dad is spokesman for the tenants’ association, and there are bad-tempered meetings about whether to accept the eviction deal. Then the building’s water supply is switched off. Worryingly, Nang’s dad has an infected big toe, which appears to be gangrenous, a complication of diabetes; the blackening spreads like the mould on the apartment’s ceiling. This is a gentle-going watch, understated – underpowered even – and sometimes a little drowsy. Still, it has real sensitivity and insight into the transition to adulthood, as gradually it dawns on Nang that his parents don’t have all the answers.

4/16/2022,"Festival fashion, with its riot of colour, sequins, flower crowns and anything-goes outfits, is back. After a two-year, pandemic-induced hiatus, Coachella, the California-based music festival that attracts 250,000 fans, made its return this weekend, bringing with it vibrant new trends and a cash boost for the fashion industry. Coachella, the most fashionable event of the festival season, is known as much for its outfits as its performances. Trends for the rest of the year’s festival fashion are often dictated by the outfits worn by celebrities like Kendall Jenner, Katy Perry and Gigi Hadid. For streetwear brands and fast-fashion labels, Coachella is particularly important. The Boohoo-owned fast-fashion label, Pretty Little Thing, streetwear resale site StockX and US-based Gen Z retailer Revolve will sponsor areas at the festival, not just to advertise to attendees but also to those watching from home and on social media. Ebony-Renee Baker, fashion editor of the Refinery29 website, describes it as “such a big commercial opportunity for brands and influencers – it’s just gotten so huge now and is observed all over the world”. Revolve’s chief brand officer, Raissa Gerona, described Coachella to industry analysis website The Business of Fashion as “essential, it’s massive … it’s this kind of Super Bowl”. Festivals have long had fashion influence, since Woodstock cemented hippy chic as an aesthetic in 1969. Over the years, images of ravers in fields and Kate Moss at Glastonbury have made tracksuits and Hunter wellies fashionable. Recently, festival trends have included crochet and cycling shorts – now stalwarts of summer style. There have also been controversial moments, as in 2017 when the trend for Native American-style headdresses led to claims of cultural appropriation. Influencers stand to make significant sums, too. Maryam Ghafarinia, who has 186,000 followers on Instagram, described to the New York Post how she will capitalise on attending Coachella, charging brands upwards of $2,000 (£1,530) per post from the site. Amy Luca, a senior vice-president at Media.Monks, a global marketing and advertising services company, said these sums are dwarfed by the fees commanded by household names: “When you’re talking about models and reality TV stars, that [payment] can be as high as hundreds of thousands of dollars.” Baker said that festival season is often an opportunity for people to try out trends. “I’m predicting lots of 90s vintage-inspired looks, balletcore’s tulle skirts and leotards, cottagecore’s floral dresses, straw hats, lots of lace,” she said. Fast-fashion brands know that festival season is a time when consumers spend – The Business of Fashion is reporting a boost of 173% for sales of festival fashion items across the sites Boohoo, H&M, Asos, and Nasty Gal, compared to 2019. This doesn’t lend itself to a sustainable take on fashion, although Baker says that festival-goers will be looking at sustainable options. “More people than ever are leaning into thrifting, shopping secondhand and vintage. Personally, I do love a fresh new outfit for festivals, but always look for secondhand options first.” Philippa Grogan, a sustainable fashion and textiles consultant, describes festival fashion as “instant fun – [a bit like] the festive Christmas dress but in summer”. She says this makes her “question whether [the clothes] have been designed with longevity in mind… Then there’s the sort of aesthetic of the whole thing, lots of sequins and lurex, which are often largely derived from fossil fuel materials like oil and natural gas, because they’re basically plastic.” Grogan suggests getting crafty is an option. “Cut sequins out from existing things that aren’t plastic,” she said, “[and then] embellish an old cardi or something.” If festival fashion is about impact, creativity like this goes a long way: “You’re always wearing something unique if you’re really pulling something together at home with existing materials.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,Festival fashion is back as Coachella marks the return of the great outdoor music party,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/apr/16/festival-fashion-is-back-as-coachella-marks-the-return-of-the-great-outdoor-music-party
4/16/2022,"The cult of Cage has reached the point where he can star in an action comedy playing a fictional version of himself. In a forthcoming film, The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, “Nick Cage” is paid $1m to appear at the birthday of a billionaire superfan. It doesn’t go smoothly. There’s an ignoble history of famous people playing for cash at parties of billionaires and autocrats. Recently Sting struck a damning blow in the fight against Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine by reportedly declaring he would never again perform for a Russian billionaire, having done so at a 2016 wedding. Sting’s having a good war: he co-wrote an op-ed with Bernard-Henri Lévy, Sean Penn and Salman Rushdie, his biggest collaboration since All for Love with Rod Stewart and Bryan Adams. In 1984 the then-Police man appeared in David Lynch’s Dune. The film has one fan in Grimes, who, according to a revealing interview, cornered Sting to discuss it. Grimes’ 2010 album Geidi Primes was inspired by Frank Herbert’s sci-fi classic. In the same interview Grimes revealed she had a second child with Elon Musk. The billionaire formerly married, divorced, remarried and re-divorced the actor Talulah Riley, whose debut film role was as Mary Bennet in Joe Wright’s cantering Pride and Prejudice. Wright’s latest film is a “solemn” take on Cyrano de Bergerac with Peter Dinklage in the title role. Dinklage’s breakthrough was in The Station Agent, the 2003 directorial debut of Tom McCarthy. Sitting oddly in the McCarthy catalogue is “misguided” Adam Sandler flop The Cobbler, which he directed in 2014; a year later McCarthy made double-Oscar-winning Spotlight. “I loved that movie,” he says of The Cobbler. Lesser loved in the Sandler oeuvre is 2000’s Little Nicky, “which will make many of us despair”, according to the Guardian’s reviewer. Among its cast is Patricia Arquette. In 1999 she appeared in second-division Scorsese drama Bringing Out the Dead with soon-to-be ex-husband Nicolas Cage. It appears the weight of being married to Cage is often unbearable. He wed for the fifth time last year. Watch Revisit the beginnings of the Cage myth with 1983 teen comedy Valley Girl, a surprise favourite of Quentin Tarantino.
