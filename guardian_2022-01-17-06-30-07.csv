1/17/2022,"The lifelong West Ham fan Kate Longhurst’s looping header deep into injury time rescued a point against Tottenham, denying their London rivals the chance to move up to second in the WSL. The Hammers were forced to play the final 24 minutes with 10 players after the defender Hawa Cissoko received two yellow cards, either side of also conceding the penalty.  Tottenham looked to have earned a win after Rosella Ayane’s penalty had given them the lead in the feisty encounter but Rehanne Skinner’s side have still surpassed last season’s points tally at the halfway mark. Longhurst had done her best to boost the budding rivalry between the Tottenham and West Ham women’s teams prior to the game, with the French defender Cissoko telling Sky Sports that her teammate left the coaches and players silent following a powerful pre-match talk ahead of the reverse fixture. “We have to smash them because she’s going to kill us,” Cissoko said matter of factly of this game. Dagny Brynsjardottir had given the Hammers a first win over their London rivals in November and there was no love lost between the two teams from the off at Barnet. Tottenham arguably edged the first half, with the forwards Jess Naz and Ayane particularly bright, but they struggled to test West Ham’s New Zealand goalkeeper Anna Leat, who was playing her first WSL game in the absence of Asian Cup bound Mackenzie Arnold. Ayane went closest for Spurs just before the break, but when she was released on the right, she took her shot quickly and flashed the ball high and wide. Despite the pressure, Olli Harder’s West Ham looked relatively untroubled and had the best chance of the half when the unmarked centre-back Grace Fisk headed over from close range after Brynsjardottir headed back across goal for her. Sensing the problems, with West Ham struggling to hold onto the ball in the middle and Spurs lacking enough threat up front, both teams made changes going into the second half with Zaneta Wyne, who played under Harder at Norwegian team Klepp IL, on in the middle and Tottenham’s top scorer Rachel Williams called upon to improve the Spurs attack. It would be Spurs that would reap the rewards for their continued pressure in the second half. Already on a yellow card, and perhaps too fired up by Longhurst, the defender Cissoko clattered into the back of on-loan Tang Jiali, conceding a penalty but staying out of the book, and Ayane fired the spot kick into the bottom corner and just out of reach of the diving Leat. Three minutes later and Cissoko was gone for the second time this season, receiving her second yellow for dissent, having booted away the ball after she felt she was unfairly penalised for a foul on Naz. With injury time well underway though, Longhurst’s stunning header from Byrnsjardottir’s cross ensured West Ham share the spoils and put the team one point shy of the 15 they accumulated across the course of last season.",Sport/Football,Kate Longhurst’s late goal for West Ham damages Tottenham’s WSL title bid,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/16/tottenham-west-ham-womens-super-league-match-report

1/17/2022,"TV and radio stars have rallied behind the BBC after it was revealed the government plans to freeze the broadcaster’s funding and eventually scrap the licence fee. Match of the Day host Gary Lineker criticised the move by the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, which emerged in briefings over the weekend and could force the corporation to close services and make redundancies.  Lineker told his 8 million Twitter followers the BBC was revered, respected and envied around the world. “It should be the most treasured of National treasures. Something true patriots of our country should be proud of. It should never be a voice for those in government whoever is in power,” he wrote. Dorries is expected to confirm the cost of an annual licence will remain at £159 until 2024. The licence, which is needed to watch BBC channels and access iPlayer, will then rise slightly for three years before ending completely in 2027. Dorries remarked: “This licence fee announcement will be the last. The days of the elderly being threatened with prison sentences and bailiffs knocking on doors are over. Time now to discuss and debate new ways of funding, supporting and selling great British content.” However, Armando Iannucci, the creator of The Thick of It, challenged Dorries’ assertions. “If you really think your government can win back the public by tossing out a panicky weekend threat to the BBC, then you under-estimate the level of support, admiration and respect the public has for it,” he replied. Former children’s laureate Michael Rosen, who regularly appears on Radio 4, mimicked the prime minister in addressing Dorries. He wrote: “Good to see your plans to give the BBC a kicking. I thought of Herodotus pinning Hannibal to the Golden Fleece. Nation shall speak unto nation but not via Broadcasting House, eh babe? Repressio pressio Boris.” Others recognised the BBC had its critics on the left as well as the right. Comedian Nish Kumar, who hosts the Mash Report, described the government as “a pack of pissed up cultural vandals”. He added: “I know that it feels like absolutely everyone hates the BBC right now, and there are good reasons for that, but ending the licence fee is bad news.” Some were more succinct. Businesswoman Deborah Meaden, one of the investors in the BBC’s Dragons’ Den programme, said: “You will miss it when it’s gone.”",News/Media,TV and radio stars rally behind BBC over plans to scrap licence fee,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/16/tv-and-radio-stars-rally-behind-bbc-over-plans-to-scrap-licence-fee
