1/13/2022,"As Omicron continues to spread rapidly across the country—and the world—it’s become clear that some Omicron symptoms are different from those of previous COVID-19 variants. People are reporting less loss of taste and smell and more cold-like symptoms, for starters. And there’s one symptom in particular that keeps coming up with Omicron: a headache. Early data from the U.K. published in the BMJ lists headache as one of the most common symptoms of Omicron, along with a runny nose and fatigue. Twitter is also flooded with anecdotal reports of headaches tied to Omicron. Data from the Washington State Department of Health released last week show just how common a headache is with Omicron: A whopping 65% of patients reported having one, making it the most common symptom the health department detected in people with the variant. Of course, headaches are common and can be caused by a slew of different things. So, what should you do if you develop a headache right now? Doctors break it down. It’s important to note that a headache isn’t a new symptom of COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) cites headache as one of the most common COVID-19 symptoms in a list that hasn’t been updated since February 2021. Other symptoms include: Fever or chills Cough Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Fatigue Muscle or body aches New loss of taste or smell Sore throat Congestion or runny nose Nausea or vomiting Diarrhea That said, many are pointing out that a headache seems to be more common with Omicron than it was with Delta and other variants, and the data seem to back that up. But…why? “Many respiratory viruses—including COVID—cause headaches,” says infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Doctors say there can be a few reasons why this happens with Omicron. “The general thought is that your body is experiencing an inflammatory reaction as it fights off the virus,” says William Schaffner, M.D., an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. “A headache, along with fatigue, fever, and other signs are all part of that inflammatory symptom complex.” But Omicron in particular seems to focus more on the upper respiratory tract, which includes your sinuses, says Thomas Russo, M.D., professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York. “A headache commonly occurs with inflammation of the sinuses,” he points out. Add in other factors like the stress of having COVID-19, and Dr. Russo says it’s “highly plausible” that people infected with Omicron would develop a headache. There’s also this to consider, too, per Dr. Adalja: Symptoms of Omicron are more mild in general than previous variants—especially in people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19—and that may make symptoms like a headache more noticeable than it was with previous variants. “Headache” is a pretty broad term that can range from having a minor twinge to a full-blown migraine. But Dr. Schaffner says that an Omicron headache is “more likely to be frontal,” meaning you’ll probably feel it in your forehead vs. the back of your head. “You may also tap over your sinuses in your forehead and cheekbone and have pain,” Dr. Russo says. If you happen to get a headache right now, Dr. Adalja says you shouldn’t jump to conclusions. “An isolated headache is not something that I would attribute to COVID-19 because there are many, many causes of headaches,” he says. But, if you develop a headache along with other COVID-19 symptoms, Dr. Schaffner says it’s time to take a test. You also might want to consider getting tested if you develop a headache and you’ve had a recent known exposure to COVID-19, Dr. Russo says. “If you’re in a household where most people are positive, for example, it may be a harbinger of things to come,” he adds. The best way to treat a headache due to Omicron is the same way you’d treat a headache in most other situations, Dr. Schaffner says. He recommends taking acetaminophen to reduce your pain and making sure you continue to drink plenty of fluids (dehydration can make your headache worse). “If that doesn’t work, up your game to NSAIDs like ibuprofen or naproxen,” Dr. Russo says. (These medications help block pain and reduce inflammation in a different way from acetaminophen.) And, if your headache seems to be related to inflammation in your sinuses, Dr. Russo suggests taking a decongestant as well to help relieve pressure in the area. Again, though, if you happen to develop a headache but have no other symptoms of COVID-19, you shouldn’t panic and assume you have the virus. “It could be from anything,” Dr. Schaffner says.

1/13/2022,"Tucker Carlson's latest COVID conspiracy theory is that white people are being discriminated against. The Fox News host featured footage from InfoWars in an attempt to back up the false claim. Carlson aired a shorter version of the clip, omitting context on monoclonal antibody eligibility. Parroting months-old material from the conspiracy website InfoWars, Fox News host Tucker Carlson has been pushing a demonstrably false claim that white people are being denied COVID-19 treatments because of their race. While Carlson has already equated children wearing masks to child abuse and aired a conspiracy theory-ridden interview with anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., his January 10 segment reached a new level of misleading material and outright falsehood. ""The United States has mistreated racial minorities in centuries past, they say, therefore whites must suffer now,"" Carlson said. ""So your ancestors did bad things, or people who looked like your ancestors did bad things, so now, we are withholding medicine from you. ""They call this equity,"" he continued. ""It's not equity. It is collective punishment. It's the North Korean standard. It's the definition of evil."" Airing a shorter version of a clip that was first shared by InfoWars host Harrison Hill Smith and later posted to the conspiracy site's page, Carlson omitted the latter portion of the video where Smith is told he can't receive monoclonal antibody treatment because of his lack of underlying health conditions. With COVID-19 surging across the US, therapeutics such as monoclonal antibodies have been stretched thin across the nation's hospitals. Now, evidence suggests that two of the three monoclonal antibody treatments may be less effective against the Omicron variant. ""If you were 65, you'd be good,"" the nurse tells the InfoWars host in a portion of the video Carlson didn't air. ""But nope, you're healthy and [have] no medical conditions, so research shows that you should be able to fight off COVID."" Despite the nurse giving the patient a clear answer, Carlson came to the opposite conclusion. ""So you can't get lifesaving drugs from the government of Texas if you're the wrong color,"" Carlson said after airing the shortened clip. ""Think about that."" In response to Insider's request for comment, a Fox News spokesperson backed up the primetime host. ""Tucker Carlson's monologue cited official government documents from the FDA and health departments in New York City, Utah, Texas, Minnesota as evidence for the claims that non-black or non-Hispanic COVID patients are facing adverse race-based factors impeding them from receiving COVID therapeutics and other scare [sic.] drugs for treatment,"" the media representative wrote in an email. The Texas Department of State Health Services has gone on record to state that white people are not being denied antibody treatments because of their race, and neither the FDA nor any of the states mentioned by Fox say ""you can't get lifesaving drugs"" on the basis of race, as Carlson claims they did. A CDC study published on January 7 explained the disparity in COVID-19 deaths by race while noting that full vaccination and receiving a booster shot drastically reduce the disproportionate outcomes. ""Population-wide data have demonstrated that COVID-19 hospitalization and death are more frequent among Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons than among non-Hispanic White persons,"" the authors write. After the misleading clip was aired, Carlson, for his part, said he can't help it if his viewers are left to conspiratorial thinking. ""I mean, if you wanted to make the population radical and distrustful and conspiracy minded — if you wanted to destroy the bonds that hold people together — this is exactly what you'd do,"" he said.

1/13/2022,"Oh, what a tangled web they’ve woven! After months of denying the reports, YouTube’s endlessly controversial ACE Family — comprised of married super-influencers Austin McBroom and Catherine McBroom (née Dolores Paiz), plus their three young children — finally admitted to losing their California mega-mansion to the hungry jaws of foreclosure. In late November, the McBrooms released an hour-long YouTube video explaining the circumstances that led them to acquire and eventually default on the flawed property. Per the couple, it was a cabal of unscrupulous people — an unlicensed contractor, a shady architect and even their own realtor — who “screwed [Austin and me]” out of “millions of dollars.” That video went viral, and has since racked up nearly 4.5 million views, though it’s been met with decidedly mixed reactions. While the family’s longtime fans rallied around them, various other YouTubers and creators were far more harsh, releasing spoofs and compiling evidence to dispute some of the McBrooms’ head-scratching claims. The empty house has now been put up for grabs as a foreclosure sale, presumably because the lenders would like to recoup some of their losses. Though the current listing bravely sidesteps mentioning any of the mansion’s problems, there are many — and the McBrooms were only too happy to expose all the construction defects in their video. Per the family, there are multiple water leaks, uneven and improperly grouted floors, and a swimming pool that doesn’t actually hold water — and that’s just for starters. The house also has (had?) no gas or hot water; Catherine claimed she was forced to “give my babies cold baths” for an extended period of time. How or when that troubling situation was remedied remains unclear. More from DIRT Britney Spears' Infamous Former L.A.
