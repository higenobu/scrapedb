3/23/2022,"For many homeowners, one of the milestones on the path to financial independence is being able to pay off their mortgage. With typical mortgages lasting 30 years, it can take a long time to meet this goal. But what happens when you pay off your mortgage? There are, in fact, a number of steps to making your final mortgage payment and figuring out what to do next. Consider working with a financial advisor as you work toward your financial goals and overall independence. How to Pay off a Mortgage When you're ready to pay off your mortgage, follow these steps to accomplish your goal. Keep in mind that because of accrued interest, the balance on your mortgage statement isn't the payoff amount. Contact your lender online or over the phone to request a payoff statement. The mortgage company will send you a letter with a payoff amount through a specific date. This amount includes accrued interest through a certain date. Pay the amount due by the due date or expiration of the payoff statement to eliminate your mortgage. Any excess amount that you pay will be refunded. Since most mortgages have property taxes and homeowners insurance premiums included in the monthly payment, there will be an amount leftover when your mortgage is paid off. Request an escrow account refund and set that money aside to pay those bills when they come due. What Happens When You Pay off Your Mortgage? Once your final payment is made, there are certain actions that the mortgage company and you should make to formalize this milestone. Receive mortgage documents: The mortgage company will send you a canceled promissory note, updated deed of trust and certificate of satisfaction. These documents prove that your mortgage is paid off. Save them in a secure location. Stop automatic payments to your mortgage company: Ensure that any automatic payments you've established have been canceled. With your mortgage paid off, you do not have to send the mortgage company any more money. Send discharge of mortgage letter to your county: Your mortgage company should send all of the required documents to your county clerk's office notifying them that your home is no longer bound by a mortgage. If they have not within 90 days, bring your mortgage documents to the clerk to update their records. Notify your insurance company: Contact your insurance company to let them know that your mortgage has been paid off. They may require a copy of your mortgage documents to verify that this is true. Celebrate this milestone: This is a momentous occasion, so take the time to celebrate it with your significant other, family and friends. Managing the Ongoing Expenses of Your Home Even though your mortgage is paid off, that doesn't mean that you no longer have any house expenses. It is a good idea to set aside savings accounts for each of these ongoing expenses. Property taxes are typically a portion of the value of your home and are paid near the end of the year. Assuming that your home continues to increase in value, this bill will also increase each year. This bill varies based on the type of home you have, coverages and deductibles selected, recent claims and other factors. While you can pay monthly, you'll often save money by paying it once a year. Some homes are in communities with homeowners associations that charge dues. These dues are often monthly or quarterly. It is recommended that you set aside 1% of your home's value for repairs and maintenance. Even if you don't spend that much each year, you'll need the excess for bigger projects. These could include things like replacing a roof or painting your home. Styles and tastes vary over the years, so you may want to set aside money to pay for larger projects, like updating bathrooms, remodeling the kitchen and replacing windows. What You Can Do With Your Extra Money When you pay off your mortgage, you'll suddenly find yourself with more money each month. Depending on your financial plan, some or all of these steps may be useful: Focus on paying off debts: If you have other debts, ""snowballing"" your mortgage payment towards the next debt can accelerate its payoff. Build your emergency fund: Experts recommend having an emergency fund that is three to six months of your monthly expenses. The good news is that the number is much smaller now that you've eliminated your mortgage payment. Max out your retirement plans: If you're not doing so already, putting extra money towards maxing out your company retirement plan and traditional or Roth IRA is a great idea. This is especially true for investors 50 and over who have access to ""catch-up"" provisions. Invest in a brokerage account: When your retirement accounts are set, investing in a brokerage account enables you to invest without locking up your money until you reach retirement age. Increase your insurance coverage: Many homeowners do not have adequate life, long-term care or disability insurance coverage. Speak with a financial advisor to determine what number you need to meet your goals. Contribute to college savings accounts: If you have kids or grandkids, helping them out with their college expenses may be a goal of yours. Contributing to a Coverdale Savings Account or 529 plan is a good way for that money to grow tax-free for education. Strategies for Paying off Your Mortgage Quickly Most homeowners make all of their payments according to the mortgage schedule. But there are other ways that you can accelerate the payoff of your mortgage ahead of schedule. Bi-weekly payments: Bi-weekly payments allow you to pay half your mortgage payment every two weeks instead of once a month. This also makes it so you pay one extra payment each year, which shaves off about four years from the standard 30-year mortgage. Lump sum payments: In addition to making the normal monthly payment, some homeowners pay extra when they can. Examples include tax refunds, annual bonuses, inheritances and other unexpected windfalls. Rounding up payments: By rounding up your mortgage payment to the next $100 (or more), you'll be paying extra towards the principal of your mortgage every month. Most homeowners won't miss the additional payment out of their monthly budget. Mortgage payoff fund: Instead of paying extra towards your mortgage, you can set up an investment account dedicated to your mortgage. You'll add extra money to this account to earn stock market returns – provided those returns exceed your mortgage interest rate. At some point in the future, you can cash out this account and pay off your mortgage if you'd like. Bottom Line Paying off your mortgage is a goal that many homeowners dream of. When you pay it off, there are certain steps you should take to formalize it. Additionally, now that your mortgage is gone, you'll have extra money to use on your other goals. But, you also need to set aside money for ongoing expenses, like property taxes and insurance.

3/23/2022,"When markets turn volatile, it’s natural to look for some signal to cut through the additional noise and to clarify the stocks that are set for long-term gains. One signal that some investors latch onto is the trend of insider trading. CEOs, CFOs, COOs, and Board members all have access to the deeper workings of their companies, and their positions hold them responsible for company performance. This gives them a vested stake in the company – and it also gives them a much clearer view of their companies’ potential stock performance. To level the playing field, Federal regulators require that the insiders publish their trades in a timely fashion, and this makes it possible for the retail investor to see what the insiders are doing. Against this backdrop, we’ve used the Insiders’ Hot Stocks tool, from TipRanks, to look up details on three stocks that have recently attracted substantial ‘informative buys’ from their company officers. All three are also considered ‘Strong Buys’ by the consensus of the Wall Street analysts. Let’s dig a little deeper, to find out what else should bring them to our attention. Natera (NTRA) We’ll start with Natera, a leader in the medical testing realm. Natera focuses on cell-free DNA, or cfDNA, testing; that is, doing genetic tests based on fragments of the subject’s DNA floating freely in the bloodstream. The company has several testing platforms, including Panorama as a set of non-invasive pre-natal tests; Signatera, a set of tumor-specific assay tests to generate individualized cancer treatments; and Prospera, a set of best-in-class organ tests, to screen for rejection before transplant surgeries. The Texas-based company has expanded its operational footprint to 90 countries around the world, and boasts over 3 million cfDNA tests performed in total. While Natera’s business boomed in 2021, the company’s net loss grew deeper. Natera generated $173 million in revenue in 4Q21, up 54% year-over-year. This included a 51% increase in product revenues. For the full year of 2021, the company recorded $625.5 million at the top line, a 60% increase from the previous year. During the year, Natera processed over 1.45 million cfDNA tests. This was up 51% from the 961K tests processed in 2020. At the same time that revenues were increasing, Natera recorded deeper net losses. For 4Q21, the company reported negative EPS of $1.48. This was a loss increase of 66% compared to 4Q20. For all of 2021, Natera’s net loss came to $5.21 per share, nearly double the $2.84 net EPS loss from the pre-corona year of 2019. For investors following the insider moves, Natera this month has seen several important developments. First, the company was accused early in the month of deceptive billing practices. This allegation prompted a major sell-off of NTRA shares – it also prompted the company to decisively rebut the charges the next day. This issue has not yet been resolved; the company points out that the allegation was made by a short-seller research firm. A week after the billing allegations, on March 14, the company announced that all top execs, including the CEO, CFO, COO, the co-founder, and the executive chairman, plus the non-employee members of the Board, will take the remainder of their 2022 salaries in company stock rather than cash. The company promoted the move as a vote of confidence by insiders in the stock. Within days of that announcement, Roelof Botha, the lead independent director of the Board, spent over $5 million to pick up 153,000 shares. Assessing the recent allegations, BTIG analyst Mark Massaro noted, ""We think [the] weakness in the stock was overblown... NTRA management decisively refuted all the allegations, which helps to alleviate some of our concerns... We think that the most likely scenarios range from NTRA avoiding any fault in this matter at all, to potentially NTRA possibly paying a settlement agreement in the event a formal investigation occurs."" To this end, Massaro gives Natera stock a Buy rating, and his $100 price target indicates his confidence in a one-year upside of 152%. (To watch Massaro’s track record, click here.) Overall, Wall Street remains bullish here, with the 10 recent reviews breaking down 9 to 1 in favor of Buys over Holds for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $39.25 and their $103.75 average target implies an upside of ~164% for the year ahead. (See NTRA stock forecast on TipRanks) Vita Coco Company (COCO) Next up on our list of insider buys is Vita Coco, a small-cap ($510 million) beverage company focused on the creation, marketing, and distribution of coconut-based beverages and other drinks in the healthy foods market. The company has several brands, including its flagship Vita Coco, the energy drink Runa, a protein-infused water called PWR LIFT, and Ever & Ever, a sustainable enhanced water. Vita Coco boasts that it holds a 46% share in the US market for coconut water and coconut beverages – share greater than its 10 largest competitors put together. Vita Coco went public in the fall of 2021, with an IPO that saw the company put 11.5 million shares on the market. Of that total, 9 million shares were sold by existing investors and 2.5 million were sold directly by the company. The initial price of $15 per share was below the expected range of $18 to $21 each. Even at the lower price, Vita Coco raised $173 million in the IPO. During the corona crisis, Vita Coco reported a spike in sales, as consumers stocked up on bottled beverages – and showed a preference for healthier options. In 2021, the company reported that sales continued strong, with a 22% year-over-year gain to $380 million. This was driven by 39% growth in the Vita Coco brand of coconut water. The company reported full-year net income of $19 million, or 35 cents per share, in 2021. Turning to the insiders, we find that Vita Coco’s Co-CEO and Board member Martin Roper last week bought over $875K worth of company stock – a purchase of 100,000 shares in the company. Roper now owns over 435,000 shares of COCO. Evercore analyst Robert Ottenstein sees this company in a sound position for future growth, and writes, “Consumer migration to products perceived as contributing to a healthy lifestyle, and the demographic engine of Hispanic and Asian American population growth will continue to benefit COCO’s brands and no beverage category can claim greater authenticity than coconut water. COCO’s understanding of the category, along with its irreplicable supply chain, have allowed it to beat out brands from much larger companies and maintain its commanding market share.” In line with his bullish outlook, Ottenstein rates COCO an Outperform (i.e. Buy), and his $15 price target implies a one-year upside of ~63%. (To watch Ottenstein’s track record, click here) The Evercore stance is hardly the only bullish view out there, as the shares have a Strong Buy consensus rating supported by a 3-1 breakdown of Buys over Holds. The stock is selling for $9.18 and its $12.50 average price target suggests a 36% upside from that level. (See COCO stock forecast on TipRanks) Mission Produce (AVO) The last stock we’ll look at here is Mission Produce, a small-cap company that has been a major player in the global avocado market for over 35 years. Mission handles both sourcing and production of avocados, as well as distribution, for a wide network of retail, wholesale, and foodservice customers, and four major packing facilities. The company has operations in California, Mexico, Peru, Chile, New Zealand, and South Africa, and its distribution centers offer additional services including ripening, bagging, packaging, and logistics. Mission also owns over 10,000 acres of growing space, distributed around the world to take advantage of differently timed growing seasons. In addition to avocados, Mission also deals in mangos. Earlier this month, Mission released its financial report for Q1 of fiscal year 2022. The report showed an 18% decrease in the volume of avocados sold, which was more than compensated by a 50% increase in average selling prices compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Total revenues in the quarter came to $216.6 million, up 25% y/y. Despite the increase in revenue, the company reported a drop in earnings, from 3 cents per share in the year-ago quarter to a 19-cent net loss in the current report. Shares in AVO fell more than 20% after the earnings release. On the insider front, Stephen Barnard, President and CEO of Mission Produce, purchased 25,000 shares of AVO in the middle of this month, paying over $293,000 for the stock. Despite the low current share price, Stephens analyst Ben Bienvenu believes that AVO is a stock to watch. He writes: “We think the stock is attractive for long-term oriented investors. With volumes poised to recover as we rotate into a new source of supply, we'd expect results to improve as we pivot into the second half of AVO's fiscal year and beyond. The secular volume growth story is intact, the company's leading position in the market place is intact, and we think LT shareholder value will be realized.” Bienvenu sets an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on AVO, commensurate with his comments above, and his $20 price target suggests the stock has room for a 70% upside in the next 12 months. (To watch Bienvenu’s track record, click here) Overall, Wall Street tends to agree with the bull. The 4 recent share reviews include 3 Buys and 1 Hold, for a Strong Buy consensus rating, and the $19 average price target indicates a 61% upside potential from the current share price of $11.78.

3/23/2022,"(Reuters) -The Russian rouble briefly leapt to a three-week high past 95 against the dollar on Wednesday in Moscow, before settling close to 100, after President Vladimir Putin said Russia would start selling its gas to ""unfriendly countries"" in roubles. The potential ramifications of that move, which Putin ordered his government to sort out in one week, could boost the Russian currency, with a host of European countries still dependent on Moscow for much of their energy supplies. By 1313 GMT, the rouble was 3.4% stronger against the dollar at 100.02, earlier clipping 94.9875, its strongest since March 2. It had gained 3.5% to trade at 110.50 versus the euro. The rouble had stabilised near 105 to the dollar in recent sessions after falling to a record low of 120 in Moscow this month and even further on the interbank market to 150. Russia has taken a hit from unprecedented Western sanctions over events in Ukraine, what it terms a ""special operation"", that started on Feb. 24. Before that, the rouble traded at about 80 to the dollar. Trading in OFZ bonds resumed this week, and the Bank of Russia announced some stock market trading would resume on March 24 after a near month-long hiatus, with 33 securities included into the benchmark IMOEX index set to be traded on the Moscow Exchange for a limited period of time and with short selling banned. COUPON PAYMENT Russia appeared to have averted default on foreign debt by making a coupon payment on a sovereign Eurobond, maturing in 2029, in U.S. dollars. A bondholder said the payment had been received. But Russian holders of domestic corporate Eurobonds face delays in receiving payments settled through international agents, as transactions get snarled up by sanctions, Russia's National Settlement Depository (NSD), companies and analysts said. Demand for rouble liquidity has declined as the central bank sold 0.8 trillion roubles ($7.7 billion) at a one-day ""fine-tuning"" repo auction on Wednesday, lower than in previous days. ""Demand at overnight repo auctions is falling fast,"" Veles Capital brokerage said in a note, explaining that even though banks' liquidity levels have fallen to their lowest since June last year, lenders are repaying previous repo debts to the central bank. OFZ BONDS STEADY Trading on the OFZ bond market continued for a third day after it was shut in late February. The central bank said last week it would begin buying OFZ bonds to limit volatility, after it held its key interest rate at 20% in the wake of an emergency rate hike in late February. The central bank has so far not disclosed the size of its interventions on the OFZ market that helped stabilise prices and provided extra liquidity to the financial system. Yields on benchmark 10-year OFZ bonds, which move inversely to their prices, stood at 13.90% on Wednesday after hitting a record high of 19.74% on Monday.
