5/8/2022,"Britain’s Jamie Chadwick won the opening race of the new W Series all-female championship season in Miami. Chadiwck lost and re-took the lead in a competitive and incident-packed race. Marta García from Spain took second and Britain’s Jessica Hawkins, who is a driver ambassador for the Aston Martin F1 team, was third at the Miami International Autodrome. Chadwick is the defending W Series champion, having won the series’ first two seasons but had to work hard to win on her first outing this year. The 23-year-old is racing this season for the team backed by former Olympian Caitlyn Jenner and has opened her third season with a strong statement of intent. “That was a bizarre race, I don’t know what happened but we will take that,” she said afterwards. Chadwick fought hard with Alice Powell for last year’s title, securing the championship with four wins including victory in the deciding race, the finale at the Circuit of the Americas in Texas and on this showing she will face a similarly tough task this season but she once more showed her class in remaining calm and executing with resolute precision to secure the win. Spain’s Nerea Martí had taken pole with a strong lap but stalled on the start line as did Britain’s Powell in third. They were swamped by the field and Powell, pushing to come back, hit the wall at the exit of turn seven on the opening lap causing the safety car to be called. Chadwick, who had claimed second on the grid in the morning qualifying, led from Emma Kimiläinen as the barriers were repaired but the race was red-flagged shortly afterwards. Racing resumed after a 20-minute interval with 15 minutes on the clock remaining. After a rolling start Chadwick maintained her lead but was unable to drop the pursuing Kimiläinen. García meanwhile passed Fabienne Wohlwend to take third. Out front Chadwick maintained her composure but was not allowed any respite with Kimiläinen on her tail throughout, then on lap eight the Finn pounced with a fine, decisive move through turn 11 to take a deserved lead. A late safety car caused by another incident where Wohlwend and Abbie Eaton tangled and went off, counted out the remaining race time and it came in allowing one final lap to be completed. Chadwick made a charging restart and Kimiläinen was slow in bringing her tyres up to temperature and went wide at turn one, dropping to third as the British driver passed, to streak away with the win. Kimiläinen’s woes continued however as she spun after over pushing and attempting a pass on García through the final corners allowing Hawkins through to claim third. The second race will take place on Sunday with Chadwick on pole. The series’ intent is to showcase talent with the ultimate goal of returning a driver to F1 which has not had a woman compete at a grand prix since Lella Lombardi raced in Austria in 1976. This season the 18-driver field will contest 10 races, all held at F1 events, with the championship holding its first race in Asia, at Suzuka in Japan.",Sport/Sport,Jamie Chadwick pounces on final Miami lap to win as W Series title defence starts,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/07/jamie-chadwick-pounces-on-final-miami-lap-win-as-w-series-title-race-begins
5/8/2022,"Tradies Tim Branford and Daniel Cox are eating calamari and chips on a lunch break at the Brighton jetty, a scattering of hopeful seagulls watching on beneath the arch of remembrance. Branford, a 24-year-old boilermaker, says he is not sure how he is going to vote at the federal election, but he is not impressed with either leader. “I’m not a massive fan of Scott Morrison, but at the same time I am not huge on Anthony Albanese – to be honest I don’t know a hell of a lot about either,” he says. “Scott is pretty unpopular at the minute with a lot of the stuff he has done, but I am not really aligned with either side.” Cox chimes in, agreeing that Morrison is unpopular, but says he still plans to vote for him. “It is easier to remember the stuff that’s unlikable more than the things that have been done well, and I think there’s been plenty of that,” he says. Nearby, rocking a pram with her newborn daughter, 33-year-old Nadine from Edwardstown does remember the unlikable stuff, still angry that the pandemic experience kept her separated from family in Denmark. For her at this election, it is anyone but Morrison. “I’m looking into it at the moment. It means a lot to me to make the right decision, particularly with my daughter now,” she says, listing climate change as a priority. “But he is absolutely not an option.” Sweeping the southern Adelaide plains from the sea to the hills, the marginal seat of Boothby in the city’s southern suburbs has it all. There are the mega mansions of Springfield, battler suburbs in the middle, comfortable coastal suburbs, and the Greens voting patch of Blackwood. Boothby is a snapshot of Australian suburbia in all its varied glory. The seat has always been just out of reach for Labor, having been in conservative hands since the 1940s. But this time around, after a wave of red swept SA at the recent state election –including for the state seats that make up Boothby – there is plenty of Labor optimism. With the incumbent Nicolle Flint retiring, Labor is throwing everything at winning the seat and polling suggests its candidate, Louise Miller-Frost, is in line for victory. But the Liberals are not yet writing the seat off, and hope the moderate-aligned Rachel Swift can win back some of the small-l liberals who were put off Flint after a fierce campaign at the last election against her conservative credentials, including on climate change and her support for Peter Dutton. Grabbing a coffee at Park Holme shopping centre in the middle of the seat as the morning commute on South Road buzzes by, carer Peter Robson says he will be voting Labor at this election, describing Morrison as “pathetic”. “He’s a liar. No offence mate, people don’t want to say it the way that it is, but the bottom line is he is a liar and doesn’t want to admit it and he gets his wife to defend him,” Robson says. “My vote will be going to Labor, I’ve had enough of nine years or 10 years of the Liberal party,” Robson says. Shopping in leafy Blackwood, 73-year-old retired teacher Helen Martin says she is also considering changing her vote after supporting Morrison in 2019, describing his performance since as “ordinary”. But will she switch her vote to Albanese? “They both have as much personality as earthworms. Neither comes across as being able to make hard decisions [and] they are basing their election campaigns on dirty politics and populist voting,” Martin says. She says she was undecided a couple of months ago, but is now leaning towards the independent candidate Jo Dyer, with preferences going to Labor. “I think Liberal lack relevance and Labor lack imagination.” Despite the narrow 1.4% margin in the seat, many voters spoken to by Guardian Australia are still undecided, or looking to minor parties for something different. Hoping to capitalise on this sentiment is Dyer, the outgoing director of the Adelaide Writers’ Festival who became known in political circles as the advocate for Christian Porter’s accuser, Kate. Dyer, who is backed by Climate 200, says she has detected the “pox on both your houses” mood that has emerged strongly in opinion polls, and says neither party is offering a compelling argument. “I think there really is an appetite for at least considering alternatives to the major parties this time,” she says, pointing to SA’s historical embrace of third parties and independents such as the Democrats and Nick Xenophon. “There is a sense that people are not enamoured of Scott Morrison at all, they think he has had his chance and there is that failure to take responsibility … but there is also a sense that they are not inspired by Albo. I think people think he is a decent chap, but there is not that big inspiring narrative from Labor,” she says. Kristy Knight, 37, from Glengowrie, is one of those who has turned off the major parties after she lost her job by refusing to get vaccinated during the pandemic. “I haven’t narrowed it down, but the smaller parties are more in line with my current views.” While the anti-Morrison sentiment is prevalent throughout the seat, there is not a sense that the tide has completely gone out on the Liberal party, and it is difficult to find voters who voted Liberal last time who are switching to Labor. Arwin Caras, an IT engineer from St Marys, says he has decided to stick with Morrison, whom he supported in 2019. “I haven’t seen much of the news lately but I am still voting for Scomo,” the 40-year-old says. “I’ve seen this leaflet comparing what was done from the previous administration, they have details on what Labor has done and what Liberals have done and all are in favour of the Liberals, and so based on that data, I am voting for Scomo,” he says. “I think he is doing a good job in terms of the economy.” Roger Koschade, a lifelong Labor voter, is considering voting Liberal for the first time, but is also still undecided. He says he has been impressed with the credentials of Swift and disappointed with Albanese, whom he describes as a “complete non entity”. “That couldn’t be more disappointing to me as a Labor man,” he says. “I just want somebody we can believe in, that is probably the most top of my list,” he says. “I’m finding it really, really hard because one just says what they’ve done, and the other one just says what they can do. “Everything just sounds like promises to get your vote. I can’t help but be cynical.” Labor candidate Louise Miller-Frost, a former chief executive of St Vincent de Paul, is door-knocking in Blackwood, down the road from the Waite reserve, where the opposition is promising $1.6m for a playground and park upgrade. She says climate change action is a priority, but an “enormous” part of the contest is a referendum on Morrison and the Coalition government. She accuses them of presiding over “nine years of inaction, that is all announcements and media and then no follow-through”. “I think people are ready for change. “This is about changing the government. That was really one of my main motivations for running. We’re not going to get any meaningful action on climate change, we’re not going to get a federal Icac, we are not going to get meaningful action on women’s issues while we have Morrison and Joyce, so changing the government is really important.” Swift, a medical researcher and Rhodes scholar, acknowledges there is frustration within the community, but says she has heard negatives and positives about both Morrison and Albanese. “The message I would give to people is, it’s much more about a strong team and what issues you want to be delivered on,” Swift says. “It’s very easy to find any lightning rod as a focal point when people are frustrated, and certainly you see it as a candidate, that’s just a reality. “But I think we have done a good job. I don’t think any election decision rests solely on past performance. It’s got to be about what are the issues that are going to be front of mind when the ballot box is open, and how we, as a government, can actually deliver on those.” On climate, she is quick to point out the Morrison government’s commitment to net zero by 2050, but says there is scope to be more ambitious. “I think there is real opportunity for us to deliver faster, but what I do strongly resonate with is the sense that there has to be a plan.” As the debate heats up, it’s clear the result could still come down to the wire, with the votes of people like single mother Michelle Trott still up for grabs. “I keep changing my mind,” the 49-year-old radio promotions worker says. “As it gets closer, I’ll keep watching to see who is going to actually show us what they’ve got, and then hopefully trust they’re going to do what they say.” In a sign of the fierce contest for the seat, Trott says her letterbox has been bursting at the seams with campaign material, much of it negative. “Too much smearing,” she says. “I don’t like the parties that do the smear campaigns on the other side rather than just tell us what they are going to do. I don’t really like either at the moment. I’ve just completely lost interest to be honest.” Trott says she will most likely make up her mind when she picks up the pencil in the booth on election day. “Even then I won’t be sure.”",News/Australia news,Dissent and disaffection in the mega mansions and battler suburbs of Boothby,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/08/dissent-and-disaffection-in-the-mega-mansions-and-battler-suburbs-of-boothby
5/8/2022,"The Australian government says almost nine out of 10 visits to GP clinics are bulk-billed, but a health insurance researcher says gap fees often aren’t recorded, meaning the official data is “a great big lie”. Andrew James*, his wife, and their two children were bulk-billed for 15-minute appointments at their Sydney GP clinic for three years with their Medicare records showing they paid “$0”. However, at every appointment, James and his family were charged a $35 gap fee as a separate Eftpos transaction. “There was nothing on our health records capturing this money as an out-of-pocket expense,” he said. “I tried to address it with the clinic, but I did not push too hard because there are not many places to go near me and the doctors there are very good. In their defence, they have bulk-billed my flu shot since Covid because of my asthma, and sometimes they wouldn’t charge the gap for the kids, but not that often.” In GP appointments alone, the family was paying about $300 a year despite the official $0 figure on their records. Dr Margaret Faux, a solicitor and health insurance law academic recently published her PhD on Medicare claiming and compliance. She says the experience of James and his family demonstrates why the government’s bulk-billing data has been drastically overinflated and “is a great big lie”. “It is an example of a very common problem that completely skews the bulk-billing statistics,” Faux, who is also a registered nurse, said. “As far as the government was concerned, up until July last year that busy Sydney practice was a bulk-billing practice and their patients were not paying out-of-pocket costs, which was not true. In fact … patients of that practice were paying $35 cash as well as being bulk-billed, but the $35 was never seen on any records collected by the government and never will be.” This type of billing is illegal, Faux said, but her PhD research showed it was rife. Faux is the founder and CEO of Synapse Medical, which educates health providers about how to bill their patients legally. The Medicare billing system is so complex, she said, that education services like hers were needed. “The other issue about ‘gap fees’ not being charged properly is that it blocks patients and their families from reaching safety net thresholds, which are there to lower their out-of-pocket costs,” Faux said. “The safety net only kicks in once you have paid a certain amount out-of-pocket. But if the government doesn’t see your out-of-pocket costs, because they are charged on a separate Eftpos transaction, then you don’t reach the threshold.” The academic says many clinics do not know they are billing illegally because the practice has become so common. What should happen is that either the patient is bulk-billed and pays no money – or they are charged a private fee, a portion of which is rebated by Medicare directly into the patient’s bank account. The clinic James attends now does this. But many clinics are claiming the rebate for themselves and charging the patient a separate gap. Faux said everyone should log in to Medicare and view their records and look at the “cost to claimant” column. If a cost in that column says $0 but you paid for the service and were left out-of-pocket something was likely wrong, she said. “This is a massive problem that I see or hear about very often in my daily work, and is why the bulk-billing statistics are essentially rubbish,” she said. The Coalition has repeatedly boasted about bulk-billing rates ahead of the election. A spokesperson for the federal health minister, Greg Hunt, said: “GP bulk-billing rates reached 89.6% in the quarter from July to September 2021 … This means around nine out of 10 GP consultation services (not patients) are being provided at no cost to the patient.” In March, Hunt issued a press release stating: “Essential medical care is more affordable than ever before with the number of Australians receiving essential medical care with no out-of-pocket cost continuing to rise.” Out-of-pocket health costs are a key issue for patients, the chief executive of the Consumers Health Forum (CHF), Leanne Wells, says. “We have been sceptical for some time about claims of high rates of bulk billing,” she said. “The rates don’t reflect people’s experience when they find it hard or impossible to find a bulk-billing doctor.” To address rising out-of-pocket health costs, medical bodies including the Australian Medical Association and the Royal College of General Practitioners argue Medicare rebates to patients need to increase. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The AMA president, Dr Omar Khorshid, said rebate freezes under both major parties meant the rate of growth in a patient’s Medicare rebate was less than inflation and wages growth. “In real terms, general practice is being asked to do more with less and this is impacting practice viability and access to services for patients,” he said. The CHF agrees increasing rebates would boost primary health care. “If the rebate was raised it could encourage more realistic bulk billing,” Wells said. Neither the Coalition nor Labor are promising to increase rebates. Faux believes they should, but also argues until the problem of non-compliant billing and a dysfunctional Medicare system is addressed, a rebate rise would do little to reduce out-of-pocket costs. “Say we put the rebate up from $39 to $40. Do you honestly think the GPs who are billing incorrectly and charging, for example, a $35 ‘gap’ are going to reduce that amount to $34? Obviously not. The GP is just going to pocket it. That’s not going to alleviate the out-of-cost burden on this consumer. “So until we fix the broken, non-compliant business model, we can’t increase the rebate.” Faux said wrongful billing was not detected by government compliance officers because it was so common and didn’t show up on Medicare records as an outlier. Anthony Scott, a professor of health economics at the University of Melbourne, agrees with Faux that bulk-billing statistics are inaccurate. He praised her work on billing compliance saying she was the first person to tackle it in-depth. Scott said out-of-pocket health care costs were rising faster than wages and faster than other consumer prices – and neither of the major parties had offered significant policies to address the issue. Adding to rising GP costs are specialist expenses, where there is scant transparency around out-of-pocket costs and fees. Scott said it can be more difficult to “shop around” for a specialist appointment because wait lists are long, referrals are hard to get, and appointments are scarce. “Specialists are just not touched by any calls for reform,” Scott said. This is despite only 35% of specialist consultations being bulk-billed in 2020-21, he said. Less affluent people with more urgent health needs are also affected disproportionately by these fees and forced onto public lists where wait times are longer. “There’s even less oversight and data when it comes to the specialist side of the health care cost debate,” Scott said. “In oncology, for example, an increasing proportion of cancer care is being undertaken by the private sector. And when you have cancer, you just want to get rid of it as quickly as possible. You haven’t got time to shop around.” *Name changed for privacy reasons Do you know more? melissa.davey@theguardian.com",News/Australia news,‘A great big lie’: researcher disputes government claim that 90% of GP visits are bulk-billed,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/08/a-great-big-lie-researcher-disputes-government-claim-that-90-of-gp-visits-are-bulk-billed
5/8/2022,"With two weeks to go until the 2022 federal election, most of the key policy offerings from the major parties have already been outlined – but there are some big gaps. From conservation to education and the arts, both Labor and the Coalition have been short on detail. Here are six areas where voters are left in the dark: There is no shortage of evidence that Australian governments are failing to protect the country’s environment and that its unique wildlife and landscapes are suffering as a result. Over the past three years, the evidence has been laid out in several reports. Graeme Samuel, the former competition watchdog head, was charged with undertaking a once-a-decade review of national conservation laws and found they were failing and the environment was in unsustainable decline. The auditor general reached similar conclusions. The Coalition made deep cuts to environment program funding after being elected in 2013 and it has been only partly restored. Australia is the global capital for mammal extinction. The number of ecosystems and species under threat is accelerating, in part due to extreme events such as bushfires and ocean heating, due to the climate crisis. Plans to protect them have often not been delivered. Despite this, at the time of writing neither major party had released a new overarching environment policy, or formally responded to Samuel’s 38 recommendations on how to fix the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The Coalition has tried and failed to pass legislation that would hand more environment decision-making powers to state governments – a step described as cutting “green tape” – and been criticised for not improving wildlife protection. Its commitments are here. Labor is sharply critical of the government’s performance, and has suggested it would listen to Samuel. But after taking a clear position to the 2019 election, including promising to overhaul the laws and introduce a national environment protection authority, it has been quieter this time. Its commitments are here. The Greens’ policies include supporting much tougher environmental laws and setting a goal of “zero extinction by 2030”. What could the next government do to address the problem? Some scientists laid out their vision here. Australian scientists are calling for more government research funding, which has declined in recent years despite vaccines and treatments for Covid-19 highlighting the key role science plays in tackling global challenges. The pandemic has brought widespread job insecurity and plummeting morale among Australian researchers. A Morrison government decision in December to veto some funding grants has had a “chilling effect” on academic independence in Australia and made it harder to attract international talent, a Senate inquiry heard in March. A new position statement released by the Australian Academy of Science (AAS) has criticised the current approach to science funding as “not fit for purpose”. It said: “Today, Australia’s science funding system is characterised by a real declining base level of government support for public science agencies and universities.” “Despite one-off funding for research and science during the pandemic, in 2021 the Australian government’s investment in science was 0.56% of gross domestic product – which is lower than peer nations – and has declined over the past decade.” It comes amid criticism by a leading Australian climate scientist that the national science agency, the CSIRO, has turned into a “very extravagant consulting company” under the Coalition. Prof David Karoly, who worked on four of the six major assessments by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, told Guardian Australia this week that CSIRO scientists had been barred from speaking publicly about government policy, and that budget cuts had transformed the agency into one reliant on external contracts to survive. As Covid-19 was about to send Australia into its first series of major lockdowns in early 2020, the Coalition government absorbed the Department of Arts and Communications into a “super department” called the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications, removing the arts as a portfolio. . Over the ensuing year, the arts and culture sectors became one of the hardest hit financially, up there with tourism and hospitality. Lockdowns, venue closures and social distancing rules drained about $1.4bn from the live entertainment industry in 2020 alone. Yet neither major political party has outlined a single cultural policy in the election campaign to date. In the March federal budget, Josh Frydenberg confirmed that the Covid-19 relief scheme for the arts, the Restart Investment to Sustain and Expand (RISE) fund – a spend of $200m over the past two years – would receive a further $20m over the next 12 months; then all pandemic-related assistance to the arts would end, despite the industry’s peak bodies warning that the sector would take years to recover from 24 months of inactivity and financial drain. The ALP would not be drawn on whether the party would announce any arts or cultural policies before the election. The office of Labor’s arts spokesperson, Tony Burke, would not confirm whether Labor would reinstate the word “arts” into the arts portfolio, should the party form the next government. Policies arts and cultural bodies want to see implemented as a priority after the election include a national insurance scheme to cover live event cancellations or postponements due to Covid infection (the state-based systems currently only cover disruptions due to border closures or lockdowns – scenarios looking increasing unlikely as states and territories ease their public health restrictions), an overarching fully funded cultural body to train, promote and significantly expand all First Nations arts practices and, in the screen industry, a federal government commitment to legislate for Australian content quotas for the multinational streaming platforms. Given sustained high levels of virus transmission across the country, far more Covid deaths this year than the previous two years combined, and the arrival of three new Omicron subvariants in Australia, health experts have expressed surprise at the absence of coronavirus policies from the election campaign. “In terms of policy, there’s almost nothing there, which is amazing seeing as [Covid] has dominated Australia for the last two and a half years,” said Prof Adrian Esterman, chair of epidemiology at the University of South Australia. “[Covid] hasn’t gone. It’s still here, even if the pollies don’t think it is,” he said. “There’s simply no guarantee that in the next few weeks we won’t see a new variant coming along … that’s even more transmissible than these new subvariants.” The Coalition has not announced any pandemic-specific policies as part of its election campaign, but Labor has said it would establish an Australian Centre for Disease Control for future pandemic preparedness. The move was floated back in 2020 but the commitment has hardly been broached in the past several weeks of the election campaign. Last month, the Senate’s Covid committee called for the establishment of an Australian CDC. Bodies including the Australian Medical Association and the Australasian Society for Infectious Diseases have said such a centre was well overdue. Anthony Albanese has also flagged support for a royal commission into Australia’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Education is usually a central issue in the election and 2019 was no different, with Labor promising $14bn over 10 years for public schools. That ambition has been scaled back this time, with Labor promising only a “pathway” to full funding when states and the commonwealth renegotiate funding agreements that run to the end of 2023, on top of $440m for new grant funding to help students and teachers manage the pandemic. The Coalition has been even more limited with its commitments, promising $21.6m to respond to priorities including the pandemic and $40m for 700 new Teach for Australia teachers and 60 new teachers through La Trobe University’s Nexus program. While these initiatives may be worthy, none of them answer concerns from the teachers union about when public schools will receive full funding and catch up large inequities with non-government schools. The Greens have proposed giving public schools $49bn over 10 years, to fully fund all costs including out-of-pocket fees charged to parents and guardians. Higher education policy has been quiet since the Coalition passed the jobs ready graduate reform package, hiking the cost of arts and other degrees in 2020. In December, Labor promised up to 20,000 extra university places over 2022 and 2023, and 465,000 free Tafe places in nominated areas of skills shortages. Tanya Plibersek has promised an “accord” with universities to review the funding system, but that stops short of committing to unwind specific changes. The Coalition has promised $240m for “trailblazer universities”, a boost to wage subsidies of regional apprentices and $22.6m for more than 29,000 additional in-training support places.",News/Australia news,Missing in action: five issues the major parties are avoiding in the 2022 federal election,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/08/missing-in-action-five-issues-the-major-parties-are-avoiding-in-the-2022-federal-election
5/8/2022,"Toby Tyne would look out at the glistening water on the other side of the window. For about 12 months the 22-year-old had been unable to get out of bed. The only way he’d left the family home in Kempsey, New South Wales, was in an ambulance. “He dreamed of being able to just literally float in the pool,” says his mother, Angela Tyne. “But I don’t think he ever thought it would happen. He thought, ‘They’re not going to approve it.’” Believed to be the first person in the world diagnosed with spondylo-ocular syndrome, which causes cataracts and severe bone fragility, Toby was stuck in a years-long battle with the agency running the national disability insurance scheme. His brother, Hunter, who has the same disability, says Toby’s bones were so brittle he once fractured a finger scratching his back. Four years earlier the Tynes had first requested the agency pay for a pool hoist to allow Toby and Hunter to use the family pool for hydrotherapy. But Toby never made it into the water. “For someone that was bed-bound, getting into that pool would increase his mobility,” Hunter says. “And it would have given him access to outside the house and let him spend more time with family.” The future of the national disability insurance scheme has emerged as an election issue. While the political debate surrounds the increased cost given the scheme is forecast to cost $34bn this financial year, stories abound of arbitrary cuts to funding packages. There has been a 400% increase in appeals to the administrative appeals tribunal. Guardian Australia has reported extensively on how organisations that support people like Toby are swamped with cases. Many have been forced to close their books. Waiting times for an AAT decision have blown out. “It’s more like civil litigation, going up against lawyers,” says Toby’s advocate, Belinda Horne, who notes she is not a trained lawyer. “Like if I had a broken arm, I could go to the doctor and show up. I don’t have to go to a solicitor.” Toby lodged an appeal in October last year. His denied funding included the ceiling hoist for the pool, registered nurse care, psychology and physiotherapy. His appeal was one of 555 that month, a threefold increase compared with October 2020. By then Toby’s condition had deteriorated, as his younger brother had noticed. Hunter looked up to Toby, describing his brother as someone who “would take a bullet for me”. Unlike Toby, Hunter is able to leave home using a wheelchair outside the house, though he would also benefit from the hoist to safely use the family pool. “He taught me that what happens in life is a part of life,” says Hunter. “You’ve got to just roll with the punches.” As his condition worsened, Toby lost his eyesight in one eye. He lived in constant pain and the fear one wrong move, even in bed, would lead to another fracture, as it had several times already. Toby was particularly animated about the need for more hours of registered nurse care. Angela Tyne, a single mother, was a 24-hour carer for her 22-year-old son. She needed to be home to administer his medication, classified as schedule eight. A registered nurse would be able to step in, hence the request to the NDIS, but Toby’s disability support workers could not. “He was the one to say, ‘I’m bed-bound, and what Mum has to do, she should just be Mum,’” Horne says. “Really, he was just worried about his mum.’” Without the registered nurse funding, much of the care was down to Angela, who Hunter describes as their “rock”. “She is always there to help when we need it,” Hunter says. I don’t think we could have asked for a better person to put us on this journey.” In October, Horne asked for Toby’s appeal to be fast-tracked. “Mr Tyne’s matter is considered to be extremely urgent, complex, and in his words: ‘‘a matter of life and Death’,” Horne wrote in the appeal. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning By December the NDIA, represented by solicitors from a national private law firm, sent the Tynes a long list of detailed questions for Toby’s specialists to answer. The agency has spent $30m on private legal representation since July 2021. Some of the NDIA’s arguments, contained in documents lodged with the tribunal, incensed Angela Tyne. The NDIA suggested the pool hoist was not “value for money” because Toby’s “functioning [was] expected to improve with recommended physiotherapy/hydrotherapy”. Horne says Toby “just laughed” at that. “He was past the point of reacting, he knew it was an absurd process.” By March, Toby’s specialists had filed their responses to the NDIA’s questions and Horne lodged them with the AAT. They awaited the NDIA’s response, and a possible conciliation. But there was to be no hearing. Five months after the appeal was lodged, Toby died in hospital. “He had made the decision probably six months prior to no more medical intervention, being antibiotics or anything that would prolong his life,” says Angela Tyne. “He had another hip fracture, just spontaneously in bed, and ended up in hospital. And he never came home.” “It was urgent … every day was important for someone like Toby,” adds Horne, her voice trailing away. The Tynes are grieving the loss of a “funny” and “kind” man whose big presence filled their family home. “It’s a big house and now it just feels like three times bigger,” Angela says. But the fact those final months were made all the more stressful due to Toby’s battle with the agency compounds the grief. “My whole day was around his care for probably for three years of my life,” says Angela Tyne. “To have to fight all the battles with NDIS on top of caring for your child who is terminally ill and not being given support … It literally breaks you.” Tyne can’t understand the NDIA’s refusal over many years to fund the pool hoist. She says an initial request would have cost $100,000, but later they requested a cheaper model at $35,000. While many associate the NDIS with providing care, it is also about helping people with disability participate in the community and reach their goals. She believes improving his mobility and quality of life might have prolonged it. “That could have given him some comfort,” says Tyne. “His pain was extreme.” “They said to do hydrotherapy, but he can’t get into the pool without the hoist.” An NDIA spokesperson said the agency expressed its “deepest condolences to Toby’s family and recognises the exceptionally difficult circumstances of this case”. “All NDIA planning decisions are made in accordance with the NDIS Act,” the spokesperson said. “The NDIA fully respects a participant’s right to request a review of any decisions made. “It is important to note in this case the NDIS provided substantial funding of close to $400,000, including some home modifications to assist Toby in his home.” Hunter also faces his own difficulties with the NDIS. His requests for additional therapy and support work hours have been denied. He says Toby “kept fighting because it was what he thought was the right thing”. “As Toby would say, ‘We, as people who have disabilities, are the only people who know what we need to survive.’”",News/Australia news,‘It literally breaks you’: fight for denied NDIS support dominates 22-year-old’s final months,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/08/it-literally-breaks-you-fight-for-denied-ndis-support-dominates-22-year-olds-final-months
5/8/2022,"Bright, shining books spilled from my children’s bookshelves. Their pages, a carnival of anthropomorphised animals dancing, singing, leading their fullest lives. CS Lewis believed “a children’s story is the best art form for something you have to say”, but none of these ones contained what we needed to tell our six- and three-year-old sons. Their father had just been diagnosed with an aggressive leukaemia. His prognosis was poor and one night I typed “children’s book” and “death” into an internet search engine. Each title that appeared filled me with heart-knotting dread. It’s not that we’d avoided discussing mortality with our kids, but neither had we leaned into it. As I clicked “Add to cart”, I wondered if one of these books would like to handle the conversation for us? Before long, I picked the packages out of the mail. I took them furtively to my study and the books were … clunky, mawkish … as if my own awkwardness about this topic had brought forth a haul of embarrassing things. Saccharine stories about, say, butterflies dying with illustrations by the author’s artistic relative. I quickly stowed them out of sight. I did not discuss these investments with my partner. As we waited for the next oncology appointment, we tacitly agreed not to mention the future. One child went to school and the other to childcare, and he and I sat at our desks. But at my desk, I couldn’t stop myself. The search terms “children’s book” and “cancer” swept up a range of more specific titles: When Mommy Had a Mastectomy; Our Family Has Cancer Too!; Mommy in The Hospital Again; Where’s Mom’s Hair? Picture books with a painted by number feel, providing simple, literal information for young children. I bought a copy of Someone I Love is Sick for our younger son. Next a binder folder appeared in the letter box. It had different laminated pages to click in or out to tailor an appropriate story. Each page was plainly illustrated with elderly people of various cultural backgrounds, finding, say, they are bald, or on a hospital gurney being wheeled under a radiation machine. The pages were printed twice to “gender” the book about either an ill grandfather or a grandmother, with unfussy text such as: I went to the funeral, but it was hard … I got to pick something from Grandma/Grandpa to keep for my own. Our older son was starting to read, and I didn’t want him also worrying about my parents. I put the binder folder in a drawer and didn’t take it out again. Now I ordered The Invisible String, billed as “the bestselling phenomenon that has inspired readers around the world”. In my study I read about a mother explaining to her children that an invisible thread permanently connects them to those they love. Then Jeremy quietly asked, “Can my String reach all the way to Uncle Brian up in heaven?” No! I had an aesthetic, allergic reaction: could I do this to the kids? Could I do this to myself? “We tell ourselves stories in order to live,” Joan Didion famously wrote. But we also tell ourselves stories in order to die. And I didn’t want to fob the children off with tales of convenience, to tell them acceptable things to spare us having to think harder. EB White feared that writing for young readers, he’d “slip into a cheap sort of whimsy or cuteness … I don’t trust myself in this treacherous field,” he admitted, “unless I am running a degree of fever.” I wanted a book that was not too hot or too cold, too hard or too soft. A book to hold us, as in hold us in place, hold us together. I felt a version of this embrace when I read my sons the picture books my grandfather had once read to me. The saturated colour of, say, Eric Carle’s The Very Hungry Caterpillar sent me ricocheting back to the domestic palette of the 1970s. I could have been on my grandparents’ couch patterned with bright orange autumn leaves, a time when everyone I loved was still alive, and I hadn’t known loss – even if the book itself had been created in response to grief. Carle conceived of his luminous masterpiece as an antidote to the deprivations of a bleak, war-torn childhood. In a devastating miscalculation, his mother – a homesick immigrant to the United States – moved her family back to Stuttgart on the eve of the second world war. Soon Carle’s father, a man who taught his son about the beauty of stories and nature, was captured by the Russians as a prisoner of war, while the 15-year-old Eric was conscripted to dig trenches. Reading about this, I realised I was trying to keep us in a palette of bright colours, as if by existing in a perpetual cocoon, we’d be safe from harm. Part of The Very Hungry Caterpillar’s appeal, Carle believed, was that “children can identify with the helpless, small insignificant caterpillar”. When the butterfly emerges, “it’s a message of hope … I too can grow up. I too can unfurl my wings (my talent), and fly into the world.” To fly into the world though, you need to understand it. My aversion to discussing mortality was holding our kids back. Around this time, two things happened: my partner’s prognosis improved, and I quit my late-night book buying. Near our house there’s a children’s bookshop. The bookseller gently directed me to the best books to navigate rugged terrain. It turns out children are natural philosophers who are intrigued by life’s biggest mystery: death. Who knew the right book on this subject can be informative and comforting? I guess the bookseller did. But I’d now encourage adults to add this topic into children’s literary diet early, to not wait until your family is forced to confront this conversation in extremis. Giving children a framework to think about death provides them ballast when the inevitable hard time comes. Recently I asked my seven- and 10-year-old sons to help me look at a selection of picture books concerning loss and grief. “You have these feelings inside haunting you,” my older son says, “but if you can put it into words you can let go of all that emotion. Even if it’s hard, you understand.” These books sparked conversations that were thoughtful, pragmatic, candid and enlightening. The following is our joint review. A black-cloaked figure visits a house of children the night their grandmother is to die. The children try to distract the uninvited guest who finally tells them a story, explaining: “Who would yearn for day if there was no night?” In our house, this book was a big hit. The visitor is revealed to not be so frightening. The idea of grief and sorrow being a counterweight to joy and delight made intuitive sense. Animals in a forest hold a memorial for their beloved friend, a fox. As they share their recollections, a beautiful tree grows to give them shelter. “I absolutely loved this,” says the older co-reviewer, “especially the way emptying out their sorrows made them lighter.” All reviewers thought this was fantastic. Says one: “Most of the other books were a story about death, but this was unique in that it explained death.” “Ten out of ten,” says the seven-year-old. I may not be a huge fan of this bestseller, but I’ve noticed the comfort to be had in imagining a magic thread connecting us to those we love best: “The idea of the string makes me happy.” After a boy’s mother dies, he is followed by a gorilla. Both reviewers loved the stunning watercolour illustrations and the idea of a child’s grief morphing into a spirit animal that gives protection. They also liked thinking of “where you might go” after death. We all loved this quirky, original book. After his grandfather’s death, a boy finds his grandfather’s notebook containing often hilarious ideas on an afterlife: “It makes death seem like a holiday in a luxury resort,” says one child. The boy decides to write his own book on how to best live. Highly recommend. A granddaughter recalls all the ways her grandfather has made her life richer. We all loved Allison Colpoys’ illustrations, and the message that our loved ones live on in our memories. A duck has the feeling of being followed. Looking over its shoulder, it spies a skeletal character: “Good,” said Death, “you finally noticed me.” I think this is a solid 9 out of 10, but have to admit the kids only gave it 6.5. Written after the death of his son, Rosen gives eloquent expression to the experience of grief, “a cloud that comes along and covers me up”. This is complemented by the stormy palette of Quentin Blake’s beautiful illustrations. Again, this is a book that older readers might appreciate – let’s not pretend children’s books are only for children! I can’t not mention this stunning book, which chronicles a year of change in a forest’s undergrowth. (“Leaves teach us how to die,” wrote Thoreau.) A blue-tongue lizard decays, and we see in cross-section the carcass breaking down, its nutrients moving through the soil. In this classic from 1971, a family holds a burial for their cat and a child is asked to recall the 10 best things about the pet, the tenth thing being the cat fertilising the earth. This is an excellent practical guide to helping kids understand the mechanics of death, the mixed emotions of bereavement and our different cultural beliefs regarding an afterlife. “Basically,” as one reviewer puts it, “an encyclopedia of death”.

5/8/2022,"Can you imagine not giving your kids a kiss goodnight? Or not giving them a big hug before dropping them off to school? My parents didn’t do either of these things. I was born in Australia and thought it was totally normal until I started primary school, where I was one of only three Chinese girls. I began to notice my western friends’ parents squeezed them and said, “I love you” at the school gates. At the same time, I noticed other Chinese families, like ours, didn’t show that kind of affection. I slowly accepted that it wasn’t part of my Chinese culture, and never questioned it. Kelly* also Chinese, moved to Australia from Vietnam at nine years old and had a similar experience growing up. She says affection was reserved for birthdays only. “It was maybe a quick hug,” she says. “Then I saw on TV, western people hugging and kissing. It didn’t bother me, I just accepted that was their culture.” Similarly, Gianna, who came to Australia from Taiwan when she was three, said she noticed more affection on western TV shows and tried to do the same. “When I went to bed I’d give mum a kiss on the cheek. It was very rare she’d reciprocate.” Despite noticing the affection I didn’t receive, I never thought that my parents didn’t love me. I felt cared for through their gestures. For example, if I was travelling, they gave me bundles of remedies, in case I got ill on the plane. Kelly also felt her parents’ love in other ways. “After migrating here, we moved in with grandma, and my parents worked hard to save money so we could move out. That to me is everything. They always bought stuff for me, kept my room clean, just little things.” But, she says “they didn’t say anything affectionate. They normally told me off.” Kelly, an only child, also observed a gender difference in how children were treated. “My dad’s mum often cooked the boys their favourite foods, but less often for the girls. They never requested the boys to clean or cook. Whereas the girls were expected to. “Mum told me she had to withdraw from university because she had to find a job to support her family. The boys had to join the army. Back then, unless you were smart or rich, it was hard to get into uni or even complete high school. Mum studied hard and got a scholarship to go to uni but she had to decline it.” Yingjie Guo, a professor of Chinese studies at the University of Sydney, and Joanna Zhu, a clinical psychologist from Melbourne Chinese Psychological Services, both use the word “stoicism” to describe the Chinese approach to parenting. Guo thinks this stoic way of teaching is perhaps because parents feel the need to toughen their children up for the world, having had to overcome their own challenges of life in a country with a huge population and fierce competition for resources. Dr Monika Winarnita, an anthropologist, refers to this style of parenting as “tiger parenting”. “Numerous studies refer to this as … authoritarian, rigorous tactics to teach skills and work habits, to drive children towards academic success and prepare them for their future.” This parenting style has deep roots, she says. “This partly can be traced back to Confucianism, an ancient Chinese philosophy, whereby investment in their children’s education was one way of showing affection.” Personally, I make sense of my upbringing through Gary Chapman’s concept of the Five Love Languages – how people communicate love and prefer to receive it. I realised my parents’ primary love language was through acts of service. The other languages are physical touch, affirmation, quality time and gifts. Zhu explains, “Chinese parents in general express love through acts of service or making sacrifices, such as making food [and] working hard so their children can have the best education.” But, she says “for children, showing more affection is of crucial importance”. This is something she has found in her clinical work. “Often Chinese children say, ‘I know my parents love me, but when I’m upset I cannot open up to them. Either they give me a solution I don’t quite agree with or they tell me to be strong.’ “When children’s feelings aren’t heard, validated and supported, they find it more difficult to share inner experiences with parents.” This is an experience Gianna can relate to. Growing up, she says, “I felt like my problems were insignificant or a burden if I told [my parents]. I think it’s why I’m so introverted, because I kept a lot of feelings to myself.” Kelly also struggled opening up with her parents. “I think I was more afraid I would get in trouble.” Zhu says: “Chinese parents tend to assume if they work hard to provide for children, and look after them as well as they can, their children should feel loved and will naturally grow closer to them. Unfortunately, it isn’t always the case.” Though Zhu says expressions of affection were not common for previous generations, she has noticed “parenting practices have been changing significantly over the past 20 years”. Guo discusses how here in Australia, Chinese parents seem more relaxed and selectively adopt western parenting techniques. In China, with higher living standards, less social competition and less need to toughen their children up, parents are also more prepared to show affection. Zhu explains that apart from cultural factors, “on an individual level, if someone didn’t receive that overt expression of affection as a child, it may be difficult for themselves to express it in adulthood”. But “becoming a parent allows us to reflect and make decisions about whether we’re going to do something different with our children”. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Gianna, who now has three children, says “I tell my kids I love them, kiss and hug them all the time. It’s different because we were raised seeing it happening around us.” “I feel it’s something I lacked growing up and has meant I’ve lacked confidence. I’d like to give that to my kids, so they will feel more confident.” Experiencing how my parents showed their love for me, among other cultures here in Australia, I learned that people express their love for each other in different ways and sometimes we have to decipher it. However, as Zhu says, “from a child’s point of view, it’s difficult, as they’ve not yet developed the cognitive capacity to understand the unexpressed loving intention”. Like Gianna, I’ve chosen to show lots of affection towards my own daughter. Even though I didn’t question it back then, and I knew my parents loved me, I have made a different decision. I can feel my parents’ tiger parenting style comes out at times. In a way I’ve become grateful I have this to pass down to her, to toughen her up for the world. However, I balance this out with twice the warmth. I want her to come to me if she needs help emotionally; and at four years old, I’m happy to see she already does. *Names have been changed",Lifestyle/Life and style,Outward affection wasn’t part of my culture growing up.

5/8/2022,"Icheck my inbox. “Order your Mother’s Day hamper now!” the headline shouts. Delete. On my television screen someone’s trying to get me to buy their “special gifts for special mums!” I switch channels. In my letterbox there’s a flyer flogging perfumes, because “Mum’s worth every scent!” I bin it and grit my teeth. Only another week of this, and then the hardest day of the year will be behind me. When you’re childless not by choice, Mother’s Day can be a painful reminder of profound loss. For some it’s miscarriage, for others it’s infertility, and then there’s something called “circumstances”, a term with a complex set of sub-categories. My story involves all three – multiple miscarriages, long periods of apparent infertility and then a relationship with someone who didn’t want any more children. Although I gave up trying to become a mother almost two decades ago, wrangling that grief is still a daily challenge. I’m not alone. There are dozens of online groups for those of us who are involuntarily childless, people who sometimes feel isolated and/or invisible as a result. These forums are digital lifelines, offering a sense of belonging, a space to confide our vulnerabilities, a place to find empathy for our shared heartache. At this time of the year the posts are full of wrenchingly sad confessions about how much it hurts to not be a mother on Mother’s Day. I’m no Grinch. Communal rituals of gratitude and appreciation are important. Even though my anti-materialist mum called Mother’s Day “Commercial Bullshit Day”, I still gave her a present every year. Just as I would never advocate cancelling Christmas because many of us are non-believers, I’d never suggest we abolish Mother’s Day because many of us have been unable to fulfil our desire to have children. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Besides, the sense of exclusion experienced by involuntarily childless people is not limited to one day of the year. A high-profile tourism company is currently headlining every promotional email with the words “Family-Sized Holidays”, followed by promises to “get you and your family excited about planning your trip together”. Politicians on the federal election campaign trail are peppering their speeches with promises to help “working families”. Yes, involuntarily childless people like me could unsubscribe from the promotional emails and try to avoid the election coverage, but self-exclusion would only add to our sense of isolation. As a society we are gradually becoming more adept at acknowledging exclusion and loss. Our language around gender and sexuality is changing to recognise the complexities of identity. In the national conversation around Australia Day, we have at last begun to concede that for many First Nations people this is a painful day of mourning. Formerly marginalised groups are inching towards the cultural mainstream as disability and cultural diversity are represented more authentically in marketing campaigns. And some retailers are finally cottoning on to the inappropriateness of blanket sales campaigns. A restaurant recently emailed me using the term “Celebrate Your Hero” as an alternative to Mother’s Day. “Whether you’re spoiling your mum, aunty or someone else special”, the blurb read, and I latched onto that word “aunty” like a lifebuoy. When a retailer emailed to ask if I would like to opt out of any Mother’s Day promotions, I jumped at the chance. But these offers are still the exception rather than the rule. There is a lack of clear data on the numbers of involuntarily childless people in Australia. There is a lack of clear data on the numbers of involuntarily childless people in Australia. According to the ABS, approximately 38% of couples don’t have children, and around 25% of women are likely to remain childless. Government website Health Direct reports that 1 in 9 Australian couples of reproductive age experience fertility problems. But it’s hard to find any reliable statistics on how many Australians who wanted to become parents have been unable to do so. I can’t argue for more sensitivity and visibility on the strength of our numbers. What I can do is share with you the lived experience of this disenfranchised grief, in the hope that my story might inspire empathy and understanding for others who are still grieving. In Childless: A Story of Freedom and Longing I describe my seven-year-long quest to become a mother, and how that failure impacted on every part of my emotional life. And I describe all the ways in which I’ve tried to accentuate the positives in my situation. But when Mother’s Day comes around, and women all over the country are being feted by their progeny, no amount of positive psychology can override the sense of loss I feel. An occasional acknowledgement that some of us can’t share in this communal celebration would go a long way to easing the distress.

5/8/2022,"After Jules Stewart ordered an electric vehicle, her next move was to ask the property manager of her northern Sydney apartment building about installing a powerpoint in the garage. The 60-year-old speechwriter says she was happy to foot the bill, and didn’t want anything fancy – like a Tesla Powerwall or three-phase charging – just a plug to charge overnight. “It would have been just your run-of-the-mill 240-volt powerpoint,” Stewart says. “I didn’t think the owner would mind because they’re going to end up with power in their garage they didn’t have before, so it’s a bit of a win for them.” But since making the request in December she has heard nothing, despite following up twice. Stewart rents her apartment – one of 25 in a block built in the 60s – so her property manager would have to check with the strata management committee whether she was allowed to install the plug, before asking the owner for permission. “I’m desperate to get into an EV. There’s all these disincentives at the moment for EVs and it’s not a sustainable position,” Stewart says. “It should be easy.” The hurdles facing apartment-dwellers who want to use electric vehicles, install solar panels or switch from gas to electric for cooking and heating are not just financial, says Associate Prof Cathy Sherry, of the University of New South Wales law and justice faculty. And for those who rent – about half the people who live in apartments across the country – the barriers can be insurmountable. A conservative count in the 2020 Australasian Strata Insights report by the UNSW City Futures Research Centre found there were 340,601 apartment blocks across Australia, home to 2.2 million people. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Sherry says the strata system – collective management of common parts of the property – often works against optimal decision-making. Only owners can vote on strata committees, and in many cases the interests of those who live in their apartments and investors are at odds when it comes to improvements that will reduce emissions, but cost money in the short term. A little over one in 10 apartments across Australia are left vacant by investors. In Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia, the rate is closer to one in five. “Investors typically just want the money,” Sherry says. “What is the incentive for anyone who owns an investment property they don’t even rent out to make green upgrades in an apartment building?” The Zinc Building in Alexandria, Sydney illustrates what can be done. Nathan Hage, 45, is a supply chain logistics worker who serves on the building’s strata committee and says when it was built in 2005, the developers paid no attention to sustainability. Two decades on, the 45-apartment building has 10 EV chargers in the basement, with the capacity for more on demand, and 24kW of solar power on the roof, with another 70kW to be installed in the next few weeks. “There’s already people who come around, stand in the car park, look at the EV chargers and say: how do you do this?” Hage says. The process has been helped by gadgets such as the device about the size of a computer installed in the building’s electrical room that enables an equitable distribution of solar power between the apartments. Hage says he was lucky in that the hardest part was convincing other apartment owners to commit. “Each step you take it becomes more compelling because the benefits build off each other,” he says. “Once you make the leap to go solar, you’re spending less so you can afford to put more money into more solar and other improvements.” Now he says the building is considering battery options and replacing its gas hot water system. “The glorious piece is that for those who don’t care about the environment, or have the time to care about it, there’s a demonstrable financial benefit from doing the right thing, so there’s something for everyone,” he says. In many other cases, however, the process has been much more frustrating. Brent Clark is the chief executive of Wattblock, a consultancy that works with strata committees to improve the sustainability of apartment blocks. He says strata management contributes to the inertia on electrification. “Think of strata as the fourth tier of government,” Clark says. “You’ve got federal, state, local and then strata. “Those buildings aren’t going to decarbonise of their own volition, they need help from the first, second and third tiers of government to help them on the path, to decarbonise, to electrification.” Residents of older buildings face the biggest challenges, Clark says. “The most common is the red- or white-brick walk-up built in the 60s or 70s,” he says. “Sometimes you’ll only have as little as 100 amps from the nearest substation for the whole building.” As each building will have different needs, there is no one-size-fits-all solution but Clark says older buildings will likely be forced to at least double or triple their capacity to meet the future needs of their tenants. “We had one of our customers, they wanted to add another 100 amps into their building. They were looking at paying $100k.” Dale Cohen, the secretary of the Richmont strata committee in the inner Sydney suburb of Pyrmont, says the longer action on decarbonising apartment blocks is delayed, the more pressing – and the more expensive – it becomes. Cohen, now a Tesla owner, was driving a Mitsubishi plug-in hybrid in 2017 when he approached his building’s management committee about upgrades to support EV charging in the three-floor basement garage. He began to wonder what would happen if more people started driving electric vehicles. What if everyone charged at once? How much capacity did the building’s power supply have? Who would pay? And how would they do it? Answering those questions took five years. One of the most pressing challenges was getting the votes on the strata committee needed to approve any change – one that eased with reforms in NSW, the ACT and Western Australia that lowered the voting threshold needed for approval from 75% to 50% of owners. Then there were logistical and engineering issues associated with retrofitting a nine-storey building – and the cost.

This is what I mean. That’s how big the problem is.” Cohen says his building has now settled on a staged rollout that will allow every car space to be electrified as demand grows, a project that will still cost “north of $100k”. Chris Duggan, the managing director at Strata Community Association Australasia, says electric vehicle charging has become a proxy for broader issues around sustainability and the risks posed by climate change. “Traditionally policy has been strata-blind and housing policy more generally has been squarely focused on single-dwelling policy,” Duggan says. “There will come a point where EV charging becomes an infrastructure requirement.” If nothing is done tenants will vote with their feet, he says, and buildings that can’t provide sustainable amenities will fall in value. Duggan says a government education campaign is needed to guide management committees looking to make the switch, and a strata-specific grant program to help pay for upgrades to older buildings. Sherry says governments have “very rarely” mandated the retrofitting of existing apartment buildings, and most successful measures, such as the installation of smoke alarms, and window-locks to stop children falling out, have been small and cheap. Addressing climate change, she says, will be much more complicated. “There are hundreds of thousands of strata schemes in Australia, there’s no point them all reinventing the wheel,” she says. “They need mandates and guidance. That’s the reality.”",News/Australia news,‘Just your run-of-the-mill powerpoint’: Australian apartment-dwellers face hurdles in the race to install EV chargers,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/08/just-your-run-of-the-mill-powerpoint-australian-apartment-dwellers-face-hurdles-in-the-race-to-install-ev-chargers
5/8/2022,"In the half light of the approaching sunrise at Maroubra in Sydney’s south-east, Joshua Hay clambers over rock ledges, feeling his way to the ocean’s edge. Armed with his 1970s vintage rod, reel and bucket, he’s aiming to catch luderick at “the Stake”, a popular but dangerous spot among rock fishers. To get to the Stake “fishos” have to pass a sign reading “three deaths” underneath a skull and crossbones – the tally of drownings in the area. Rain has been sprinkling down on the coastline overnight, and the rocks are wet and slippery. As Hay digs around for bits of seaweed – his preferred bait – foamy water laps at his ankles. “You still get those butterflies,” he says with a grin. “That’s why they call it fishing, not catching.” The Stake is in the city of Randwick, where there have been 21 rock fishing fatalities since 2001 – making it the most statistically dangerous area for the sport in Australia. Rock fishing is the second-most common cause of drowning along the New South Wales coastline behind swimming. Despite its dangers, more than 1.2 million Australians go rock fishing every year, including a diverse group of migrants. Lin Yuan learned the art of rock fishing from “Master Han”, an experienced fisher who frequents Bare Island at La Perouse. “My friend sent me a photo of him, and said, ‘that guy always catches good fish’,” he says. Nowadays, Yuan, Han and his friend head out when it’s still pitch black about 5am, armed with a large net to keep caught fish and squid alive until they assess their haul at the end of the day. The smaller fish, or the less tasty, are returned to the sea. “Around Sydney, there’s not many secret spots anymore … and you don’t want to risk too much danger. It’s a hobby, not what you do for a living,” Yuan says with a laugh. Yuan and his mates all wear life jackets and cleats. They have seen the dangers first-hand after watching a fisher get washed away at another La Perouse spot. “Luckily his friend had a fishing rod, [and] he took off the hooks so they could grab the line and slowly fished him back in,” Yuan says. “After he got out, everyone was still fishing, even himself.” Joint research by Surf Life Saving Australia and the University of Melbourne found that a misunderstanding of wave patterns among inexperienced fishers has led to the notion of “freak” wave events. Study author David Kennedy said the notion of “lone waves … grabbing people out of nowhere” was a myth. “Less experienced fishers [surveyed] tended to look closer at the base of where the waves were about to hit,” he said. “People had seconds, at best, of warning when a wave was coming, whereas more experienced fishers were already looking offshore.” NSW councils have implemented a range of measures to reduce the risk of rock fishing, including mandating life jackets, increasing signage and running educational workshops. Randwick was the first council to make lifejackets compulsory in 2016. But a study released by the council the following year found their use had only slightly increased. Almost half of respondents to a council survey didn’t think the use of lifejackets was necessary despite a majority being aware that there was a high death toll in the area. While Kennedy agreed rock fishing was “inherently dangerous”, he said risk would be substantially minimised with greater education and awareness of surroundings. “You’re in a remote environment and that’s why people are doing it. You’re in nature, and it’s recognition [that] nature’s boss,” he said. “The element of danger is part of the excitement. “Often the decision to go fishing is made when someone leaves home … Once they’ve got down there, travelled a long way, it’s a bigger call to not fish. People will put themselves into situations they might not have.” Central Coast fisher James Cross says when people tell him rock fishing is dangerous, he replies: “It is, but no more dangerous than swimming.” This year has already been marred by a number of deaths, including a father and son who were washed off the rocks at Little Bay just down the coast from Maroubra in January. Fishers, including Cross, said La Niña had contributed to unfavourable conditions. Cross uses a canister lifejacket that can be inflated if needed, believing that being a strong swimmer, an inflated jacket may hinder his chances of returning to shore. “I know a lot of people who’ve been washed off the rocks and they know a place to swim back in … I fancy my odds, I wouldn’t be out if it was wild,” he says. Cross has been hooked on rock fishing ever since his father-in-law came home with a bag of luderick and drummer for dinner. He has introduced several other people to the sport. “People have gone, ‘where do you keep getting this fish from?’ because if I’ve forgotten a bucket I’ll tie a net on the front of the car,” he says. “It’s a good conversation starter.” Cross gravitated to rock fishing for several reasons: foraging, environmental preservation and the adrenaline rush that comes with an unexpected catch. Then there’s the “therapeutic, meditative qualities of it”. “One of the best times is the morning,” he says. “You get up with head torches, watch the sun rise over the ocean … Combine that with a sport you love, you’re getting a bite and then you come home and have a coffee and breakfast and feel like the day is just starting.” Plus, the members of the community have each other’s back. That’s what Cross loves most. “Going out and having a chat with the boys on the rocks … You can sit down with someone you’d never have talked to and have a good yarn about the fish that got away,” he says. “It brings out the best in people.” For Hay, fishing isn’t just a hobby – it’s in his bloodline. “I’ve fished my whole life, my grandfather fished, my dad fished,” he says. “There’ve been days with three of us when we’ve caught 30 fish in three hours, but some of the days I like most, I’ve gone way out, found a new ledge in the middle of nowhere, no one else is there, and I’ve caught fish. “Or days fish are really hard to catch. You try two, three hours, and finally catch one. It’s as satisfying as catching 10.”",News/Australia news,‘That’s why they call it fishing’: the people who risk their lives for a catch,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/08/thats-why-they-call-it-fishing-the-people-who-risk-their-lives-for-a-catch
5/8/2022,"The NBN rollout may have been completed, but Richard Proudfoot is still using an old ADSL internet connection, and he has to juggle his Zoom meetings around his partner’s work. He runs a small IT business from his home in Maleny, on the Sunshine Coast, about 100km north of Brisbane, while his partner is a part-time university lecturer. Due to their property’s terrain, NBN Co has told him he is not able to connect to fixed wireless or fixed line. While he has the option of satellite, many users have reported poor speeds and reliability. He has stuck with ADSL for the time being because he believes the tree cover and weather would adversely effect his service. “We are very, very dependent on a reliable internet ADSL connection. To make it work for us given the limitations, we schedule internet use based on need ... we cannot do concurrent Zoom meetings so we rearrange diaries in order to cope.” The Coalition and NBN Co declared the rollout of the then $51bn network complete in 2020. There are now 12.1m homes able to connect, and 8.5m homes on the NBN. The high-speed network was meant to resolve the digital divide in Australia, but two years on from its completion there remains a stark difference between the haves and have-nots; those who have a decent internet service and those still waiting or suffering from poor speeds and reliability on their NBN service. The Liberal MP Julian Leeser wrote a scathing review of the NBN in a submission to the federal government’s regional telecommunications review last year, describing it as “too slow with countless delays”. Leeser’s northern Sydney electorate, Berowra, is a mix of suburban and semi-regional locations, meaning his constituents are living with the spectrum of NBN technologies, from fixed to wireless and satellite. “There is too much variability in the quality of coverage across the various NBN technologies,” he said. The pandemic forced many people to work from home and rely on their home internet more than ever before. Leeser said that teachers had been forced to work out of McDonald’s car parks to leech the wifi for online classes, people were unable to work from home or undertake telehealth appointments, and some had even been forced to move out of the area due to their poor NBN connection. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Unlike the 2010 and 2013 elections when the NBN rollout was a hot topic, it has yet to grab the headlines this time around, but it appears it is still front of mind for some voters. Many Guardian Australia readers raised problems with the project when asked what their major concerns were ahead of this month’s federal election. One reader, Cate, who lives in Killarney Heights in the Sydney electorate of Warringah, missed out on full fibre or cable that some nearby suburbs have access to. She says she was originally connected via the Optus internet cable but was moved over to fibre-to-the-node (FttN) on the NBN. “Using Optus cable we rarely had dropouts. I could count on one hand the number of times over five years that we lost internet for any noticeable length of time,” she says. Now she says they experience daily interruptions. “Our modem takes five to 10 minutes to reconnect so this can often mean at least 25 to 50 minutes a day of disruption to our service and this is still considered acceptable by NBN and they will do nothing to fix it.” She says she is rarely able to get the top speeds promised. In speed test results Cate provided to Guardian Australia taken between 2pm and 3pm on a weekday, the results ranged from 1.3Mbps to 40Mbps, compared to 100Mbps on her previous Optus cable. The communications minister, Paul Fletcher, argues it would not have been possible for so many people to work from home during the pandemic under Labor’s original NBN plan.. “If we had stuck to Labor’s plan, when the pandemic hit and millions of people moved overnight to working and studying from home, Australia would have been in a terrible mess,” Fletcher said in a CommsDay Summit speech this week. Fletcher’s argument, however, is based on modelling undertaken in 2013 that NBN Co’s current management has since distanced itself from. In late 2020, the Coalition announced $4.5bn in upgrades to 8m premises to get speeds of up to 1Gbps by 2023, including 2m homes on FttN. Around 100,000 premises can now order these upgrades – provided they agree to pay for a higher speed service. There is also a $750m upgrade to wireless announced in March as part of a $1.3bn regional communications package which will also allow more people on satellite to shift to wireless and free up space on the satellite service. The Coalition is also funding upgrades through the Regional Connectivity Grants program. Many of those grants upgrade whole towns in regional areas from satellite to full fibre to the premises. However, as Guardian Australia has previously reported, two grants in the first funding round were given to upgrade a single business to full fibre in the New England electorate. Leeser told Guardian Australia he believes his community’s concerns with the NBN would be addressed through the wireless upgrades and opening up the grants program to semi-urban areas such as Kenthurst and Dural in his electorate. Labor is promising to match the spending, but go further. It has conducted detailed modelling of the rollout and determined 1.5m more homes can be upgraded to full fibre, at a cost of $2.4bn. It will mean seven out of eight FttN premises would have access to upgrades by 2025. The shadow communications minister, Michelle Rowland, said too much had been wasted by the Coalition downgrading the NBN from full fibre, only to backflip with the planned upgrades now, costing $58bn. “This is $29bn more than what the Liberals said it would cost – double the original promise – yet delivers less than the original fibre plan,” she said in a speech this week. “What Australians want is more reliable and faster connectivity.” Fletcher dismissed the plans as “vague” and targeted only at marginal electorates. Whoever wins, it will be a race against time. Around 119,000 premises that are connected to the NBN via FttN still can’t get the minimum 25Mbps download and 5Mbps upload speeds. Due to the ageing copper and environmental conditions, FttN connections will continue to get worse over time. In February, the NBN CEO, Stephen Rue, admitted the bit rate – the number of bits that can be transferred across the network per second – would degrade between 2% and 4% every year on average across the 4m FttN connections. The other looming factor is people switching the NBN off. Customers frustrated with the NBN might look to 5G or another service like Elon Musk’s Starlink, and threaten the ability of the network to make a return on the taxpayer investment. In the Sunshine Coast, Proudfoot has not reached that point yet, partly because the transfer of customers from satellite to fixed wireless could benefit him and partly due to the cost of Musk’s Starlink. “This is galling because as taxpayers we have all paid to have a universal, reliable internet connection and we haven’t got it. Instead, with after-tax money flowing directly to a US billionaire, we are paying twice for ultimately what is still an inferior product.”",News/Technology,‘They will do nothing to fix it’: why the NBN still matters to many voters,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/08/they-will-do-nothing-to-fix-it-why-the-nbn-still-matters-to-many-voters
5/8/2022,"A leading concussion specialist has accused the AFL and the players’ union of attempting to “divide and conquer” by hesitating to endorse the Australian Sports Brain Bank (ASBB) as the primary place for players to donate their brains, despite a direct recommendation to do so by a coroner. More than a year after the recommendation by the coroner who oversaw the Danny Frawley inquest, the AFL says it is “well progressed” in discussions with both the ASBB and the Sydney Brain Bank, with a view to selecting one or the other – or both – as partners for its mooted AFL/AFLPA brain bank donation program. But Dr Adrian Cohen, an expert in traumatic brain injury, director of Headsafe and senior lecturer at the University of Sydney, has alleged the governing body is overlooking the ASBB’s “specific expertise” and unrivalled bank of sports brain tissue because it “isn’t aligned” with the AFL’s approach to concussion research. In February, 2021, Victorian coroner Paresa Spanos handed down her findings into the death of the St Kilda great Frawley, confirming a postmortem analysis of his brain found he had low-stage chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a brain disease linked to repeated blows to the head. That diagnosis was made via an autopsy conducted by the ASBB, to which Frawley’s family donated his brain after the former Richmond coach took his own life following a severe decline in mental health. Frawley’s brain is one of 21 to have been tested by the ASBB since it was set up in 2018 specifically to understand CTE and other brain pathology associated with repetitive head injury in sport and elsewhere. Others include those of Shane Tuck, Polly Farmer and Andrew Macpherson, along with two anonymous former professional rugby league players – all of whom were found to have CTE lesions on their brains. Over the course of four years, the ASBB – established by the neuropathology department at Sydney’s RPA hospital in partnership with the Brain and Mind Centre at the University of Sydney and the Concussion Legacy Foundation in the United States – has become the pre-eminent brain bank in this space, having to date received more than 600 donation pledges from amateur and professional sportspeople. The coroner recommended “that the Australian Football League actively encourages players, and their legal representatives after their death, to donate their brains to the Australian Sports Brain Bank in order to make a meaningful contribution to research into chronic traumatic encephalopathy and thereby improve the safety of future generations of footballers and others engaged in contact sports.” In a formal response to the coroner’s court of Victoria, the AFL’s head of legal and regulatory, Stephen Meade, said the governing body proposed to work with the AFL Players Association to create “a structured and ongoing program of active encouragement of Australian footballers to donate their brains to research” but would not endorse the ASBB. “At this point in time, the AFL does not [contrary to the coroner’s AFL recommendation] agree to the active encouragement of the donation of brains to the Australian Sports Brain Bank to the exclusion of other brain banks in Australia,” Meade wrote in the letter dated 24 May, 2021. Meade wrote that the AFL and the AFLPA may nominate “multiple brain banks”. The AFLPA sent a separate response, also on 24 May, 2021, from its general manager of legal and player affairs, James Gallagher, who said it was “supportive of ASBB’s work” but “believe it is necessary to undertake further investigation into all brain banks”. When contacted this month by Guardian Australia, an AFL spokesperson said it was in continuing discussions with both the ASBB and the Sydney Brain Bank, “which would see brain donation and research as important components of the AFL’s planned longitudinal study”. “Those discussions are well progressed, and we anticipate being able to make a further announcement in relation to the planned AFL/AFLPA brain bank donation program in the coming months,” the spokesperson said. The AFLPA said this week it had encouraged players, through its alumni communications, “to donate their brains to research by Australian brain banks, including the Australian Sports Brain Bank and the Sydney Brain Bank, in an effort to enable a consistent approach to brain donation by former AFL and AFLW footballers”. The AFLPA declined to provide Guardian Australia with a copy of its alumni communications, citing the need for confidentiality. It is unclear who would oversee the AFL/AFLPA brain bank donation program or who would take the lead on any future project at the SBB – should it be used. The SBB told Guardian Australia talks are under way with the AFL but declined to comment further. It is also unclear, should the AFL partner with both, how it would ensure a streamlined approach both in terms of uniform research and clarity of direction for players and their families registering to donate. “The AFL want to use a different brain bank to divide and conquer,” Dr Cohen said. “As in, ‘let’s not just have one place where all the information is collated, one authority – particularly one that isn’t aligned with the way we think – let’s have multiple’. And I’m sure they would give money to multiple [brain banks] just so the Australian Sports Brain Bank doesn’t get to be the sole authority. “Yes, the Sydney Brain Bank has brain tissue. They don’t have sports brain tissue. They don’t have any specific expertise in that.” The highly respected SBB, established in 2009 and operated by not-for-profit research institute Neuroscience Research Australia (NeuRA), holds more than 700 brains and works with numerous research programs across multiple neurodegenerative disorders. It recently completed a yet-to-be-published study examining the prevalence of CTE in its brain bank population. However, unlike the ASBB, it does not routinely retrieve brains interstate, nor does it issue clinically accredited reports. “We issue accredited clinical reports, we don’t just issue research reports, which don’t have the same sort of standing,” said Dr Michael Buckland, the ASBB’s founder and executive director, and head of the department of neuropathology at Sydney’s Royal Prince Alfred hospital. “We have a proven track record in CTE diagnostics and the ability to facilitate brain donations across Australia. We would hope the AFL would work with us. And that, in fact, was the stated wish of Polly Farmer’s family when they went public, that the AFL would work with us to solve the problem of CTE.” The Sydney Brain Bank’s primary sport connection is a partnership with the Retired Professional Rugby Players brain donor program. That program is run through Newcastle University and headed up by the neuropsychologist Associate Professor Andrew Gardner. In 2019, the NRL provided Gardner with $250,000 in funding for the associated Retired Professional Rugby League Players Brain Health Study, conducted in partnership with the Spaulding Research Institute at Harvard Medical School.",Sport/Sport,"AFL trying to ‘divide and conquer’ over brain bank endorsement, concussion expert says",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/08/afl-trying-to-divide-and-conquer-over-brain-bank-endorsement-concussion-expert-says
5/8/2022,"The Liberal Democrats candidate for the federal seat of Brisbane says he “deeply regrets” a history of offensive Facebook posts, including messages that were antisemitic, described Indigenous Australians as “the enemy” and celebrated white supremacist culture. One photo uploaded by the candidate, Anthony Bull, shows him smiling next to One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts as a group of young men make hand gestures – described by Bull as “White Power salutes” - behind them. Roberts is not making a hand gesture. “Wherever x amount of AYPS [Australian Youth Political Space] members meet, a group photo with Senator Roberts making White Power salutes must be taken,” Bull wrote as a caption to the post in 2017. The hand gesture, traditionally used to signal “OK”, has also been co-opted by far-right movements to become what the US Anti-Defamation League says is a “hate symbol”. Bull shared the image – taken at the 2017 “LibertyFest” in Brisbane – to a Facebook group which has 6,000 members. Responding to Guardian Australia questions about the photo, Roberts said he “was not aware of what the people behind me were doing”. “I don’t know what a white power symbol looks like. I wholeheartedly reject all forms of racism,” Roberts said. In another post from 2017, Bull tells a Facebook friend to look up the terms “14 words and the 88 precept”, coined by prominent US white supremacist David Lane, now deceased, who was jailed over the killing of a Jewish radio host in 1984. The term “14 words” is a reference to Lane’s white supremacist slogan: “We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.” The term “88 precepts’” refers to a document Lane wrote regarding “natural law”. The Southern Poverty Law Centre says 88 stands for “Heil Hitler” among neo-Nazis, because “H” is the eighth letter of the alphabet. Bull also used the antisemitic meme the “Happy Merchant” and referred to the term Annuda Shoah, which is commonly used to mock Jews and the Holocaust. Most of the offensive comments on the Facebook profile were posted in 2017 and 2018. More recently, the account has shared posts promoting Bull’s candidacy for the Liberal Democrats, as well as images of his family. In a statement to Guardian Australia, Bull said he is “deeply regretful for these posts”. “They were statements I made in my 20s which I thought were edgy memes at the time but I now know that they were immature and wrong,” Bull said. “I am not a white supremacist, Nazi, racist or anything. I do not support these views. “I have grown since then, especially since I became a father and I sincerely regret these posts and their content.” The Liberal Democrats did not run in the seat of Brisbane in the 2019 election, and attracted less than 1% of the vote for the Senate in Queensland. However, the party has enjoyed a bigger profile in 2022 off the back of former Queensland premier Campbell Newman’s candidacy. Bull also ran unsuccessfully as a LDP candidate for Ipswich city council in 2020. His LinkedIn profile says he has a background in digital marketing and attended the University of Queensland. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning On Australia Day in 2018, Bull posted that the day should be renamed “Invasion Day, and each day we should celebrate our victory over a weaker enemy.” In another Facebook post, Bull shared a Change.org petition to accept white South African refugees. “We already take em from every other country, why not have ones that actually speak [E]nglish?” he wrote. In one post, he refers to Australian writer Yassmin Abdel-Magied as a “bitch” after her appearance on the ABC’s Q+A. “If I was a [woman] and in the same room with her I would’ve smacked her right in the jaw,” Bull wrote. “After she’s interrupted you and talked down to you for the 100th time, I’d be inclined to go ‘right, I’m getting sick of this shit [punch]’.” In a statement, the Liberal Democrats national executive said the party only became aware of the Facebook posts when contacted by Guardian Australia. The executive said the Liberal Democrats support “free speech” but the party does not condone “hate speech and rejects all of the assertions made in the posts.” “Party officials have spoken to Mr Bull who said that he sincerely regrets making the posts and has apologised for doing so and considers all forms of racism abhorrent,” the executive said. “The party acknowledges that the posts were made in poor judgement however has accepted Mr Bull’s apology and deep regret.”",News/Australia news,‘I am not a Nazi’: Liberal Democrats candidate ‘deeply regrets’ white supremacist Facebook posts,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/08/i-am-not-a-nazi-liberal-democrats-candidate-deeply-regrets-white-supremacist-facebook-posts
5/8/2022,"It makes perfect sense that Paul Kelly’s quintessentially Australian song How to Make Gravy is going to be adapted into a film. Kelly’s ballad about a prisoner, Joe, writing home to his brother, Dan, on 21 December lamenting his emotional angst about missing “all the treasure and the trash” of family Christmas, is beautifully sparse. Its brilliance, like so many of Kelly’s lyrics, lies in its fusion of the present with an evocative untold back story that provokes imaginative possibilities. While the song has become a national ode to the Australian Christmas for all its British imperial weirdness of pressing ahead with a hot roast and gravy on a 100- degree day, it is about so very much more. It’s about the push-pull of sibling rivalry and affection, the terror of losing a fragile love, the tinderbox dangers of festively mixing extended family and friends, of parental imperfection and, not least perhaps, the bitter taste of regret. It is freighted throughout with human imperfection. Alternately and, always subtly, sunny and languorous, it is also alive with the qualities essential to great filmic drama: mystery and personal tensions. Since its release in 1996, whenever I’ve been captured by the song’s superb musicianship and hooks (they make me shiver in the same way another great Kelly ballad about human foible and regret, To Her Door – that might also be about Joe – does), I’ve come away pondering about all that has happened to this point – and what’s going to happen next. It’s the mark of great art that this song has long lingered in the back of my consciousness. So much so that every time I heard it, I would develop the untold back- and forward-stories a little more. In 2020 Radio National Fictions asked me to co-write, for Gravy Day, a short radio play riffing off the Kelly song. It was one of the most pleasurable (is it OK if I say “easy”?) writing jobs I’ve undertaken. That is because the song, and all the imaginative wanderings it inspired in me, were so perpetually vivid. In that, I’m not unique; so many people who know the song will tell you about their emotional reactions to it. I had years earlier left Melbourne, where I grew up and had many extended – sometimes tense – family Christmases. No wonder, then, that the song for me unfolds between Barwon prison near Geelong and urban Melbourne (I don’t know why, but I imagined a modest weatherboard house in suburban Reservoir, Thornbury or Preston with a deep backyard, the lawn punctuated with cricket stumps, card tables covered with food, a few eskies and a fire smouldering in a 44 gallon drum as day turned to evening). But it’s a national song. This could be Darwin. It could be suburban Adelaide. Toowoomba. Fremantle. Like all great writing, How to Make Gravy ceased to be Kelly’s once he launched it into the world. He licensed us to live with – to claim – his characters. And, so, here was (little hippy sister?) Stella, flying in from the coast. The brothers “driving down from Queensland” are definitely older, though this is nowhere enunciated. Ambiguity is nothing if not muse to imaginative and creative potential. And How to Make Gravy has it in spades. Mary has got to be the older somewhat harried, unlucky-in-love but formidable big sister to Joe and Dan and the brothers – she who’s at once feared and the subject of their gentle teasing. What on earth did they do to that former boyfriend who wore “too much cologne”? Roger? He’s always been trouble. The family’s informally adopted son. He’s always clashed with Joe since their days at the tech. You can trust him to get lippy - and maybe punchy – after a few too many on Christmas night. And here comes the real fraternal (read dramatic) tension: Rita. Little brother Danny has been in love with her since worldly wise Joe brought her home for Mum’s 50th in the backyard at Reservoir a few years back. Rita, “classy”, young Danny reckons, like Kylie or that chick from the Cranberries, but also natural and understated in her white T-shirt, Levi’s and RMs, long raven hair tossed over her shoulder. Not his usual thick blue eyeliner and boob-tube type! Joe put a ring on her finger soon as he could. They wasted no time having kids. Christmas Day a few years later: ruined when Joe goes the knuckle on Roger who’s had it coming for bloody years. Danny somehow finds himself slow dancing with Rita in the yard after Dad pulls Joe into the kitchen for a talking-to. Next day, Joe’s arrested. Gets three and a half with good behaviour for that bank job. And, so, everything changes for everyone. Then, just ahead of his last Christmas inside, Joe calls Danny from the big house. “Who’s gonna make the gravy?” he asks. But that’s not why he’s calling. And he can’t help blurting it out: “Oh, brother, please don’t stab me in the back.” What’s going on? The dramatic possibilities are endless.",Opinion/Opinion,How to Make Gravy is already a movie that plays in our heads.
