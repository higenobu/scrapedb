2/18/2022,"Elon Musk has been criticised by the Auschwitz-Birkenau museum for comparing the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, to Adolf Hitler. The chief executive of Tesla tweeted a meme that showed a photo of Hitler with the words “Stop comparing me to Justin Trudeau” above the image and “I had a budget” below. The tweet was later deleted.  pic.twitter.com/ebhWoBNcM0 Musk’s use of Hitler’s image “disrespects the memory of all victims and hurts many people”, said the Auschwitz-Birkenau museum, which is on the site of the Nazi concentrate camp where 960,000 people were killed. Using the image of Adolf Hitler & therefore exploiting the tragedy of all people who suffered, were humiliated, tortured & murdered by the totalitarian regime of Nazi Germany created by him is sad & disturbing. It disrespects the memory of all victims & hurts many people. “Using the image of Adolf Hitler & therefore exploiting the tragedy of all people who suffered, were humiliated, tortured & murdered by the totalitarian regime of Nazi Germany created by him is sad & disturbing,” the museum tweeted in reply to Musk. The American Jewish Committee said the billionaire’s tweet was unacceptable and demanded he apologise. “Once again, Elon Musk has exercised extremely poor judgment by invoking Hitler to make a point on social media. He must stop this unacceptable behaviour,” it said. “Musk may believe posting a meme comparing Justin Trudeau to a genocidal dictator who exterminated millions is an appropriate way to criticise policies he disagrees with. It is not. It never is. Musk must apologise and find other ways to voice his displeasure.” Musk did not respond to the AJC or the Auschwitz-Birkenau museum, but posted another tweet that suggested his Twitter followers read a book about the economic history of Nazi Germany for “an in-depth explanation”. The world’s wealthiest person, with a $236bn (£173bn) fortune, made the original post in response to reports that Canadian authorities had ordered banks to block cryptocurrency donations to anti-vaccine protesters. Musk has frequently spoken out in favour of the Canadian trucker protests against Covid-19 mandates. Last month he posted a photo of the long line of trucks and tweeted “Canadian truckers rule”. In another post he said: “If Canadian government is suppressing peaceful protests, that’s where fascism lies”. The Tesla boss also on Thursday accused the US financial regulator of targeting him with “harassment campaign”, which he said was designed to “chill” his criticism of the US government. In a court filing, his lawyers accused the Securities and Exchange Commission of “targeting Mr Musk and Tesla for unrelenting investigation largely because Mr Musk remains an outspoken critic of the government; the SEC’s outsized efforts seem calculated to chill his exercise of first amendment rights”. The filing is part of Musk’s attempt to persuade the SEC to distribute $40m (£29m) in fines that he and Telsa paid to the regulator over misleading tweets in 2018. The SEC sued Musk after he tweeted he had “funding secured” to potentially take his electric car company private at $420 a share. In reality, a buyout was not close. Tesla and Musk settled by agreeing to each pay a $20m fine, and to let the carmaker’s lawyers vet his tweets that could affect its stock price. Musk’s lawyer said the SEC had committed to returning the $40m to Tesla shareholders, but had failed to yet do so.",News/Technology,Elon Musk criticised for likening Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler in tweet,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/17/elon-musk-criticised-for-comparing-justin-trudeau-to-adolf-hitler-tweet-auschwitz
2/18/2022,"He saw it as a relaxed chat for a local podcast about social issues in the place he has worked and lived in for more than three decades and so, by his own admission, was a little unguarded. But Sir Tim Smit, the co-founder of Cornwall’s Eden Project, has become embroiled in a furore in his adopted homeland after suggesting that the Cornish could be “a bit more fucking articulate” and were too fond of looking backwards to “good old days [that] never were the good old days”.  Smit’s words were pored over by politicians and academics on Thursday – as well as by residents and business people in St Austell, the town closest to Eden, with some fiercer critics claiming his words were racist, a charge he strongly refutes. “He’s put his foot in it, hasn’t he?” said Simon Carter, an art dealer in St Austell. “He’s a good businessman but I think he has some odd ideas. I don’t think it’s fair to say Cornish people look backwards. I actually think Cornwall’s very forward-thinking.” Mark Lawther, who runs a travel company in the town, agreed. “Cornwall is a unique place with unique people and a unique culture, which is very important for people, but it’s not remotely backward-looking.” Claire Harris, who runs an art shop, saw a “grain of truth” in some of what Smit said. “People do look at the past through rose-tinted glasses at times,” she said. “And people can give off negative vibes, which makes getting things done much harder.” Most Cornish people, she added, were “too busy making a living” to be articulate about Cornwall. Simon Knowle, a complementary therapy practitioner, said he had time for Smit and there was room in Cornwall for all sorts of views. “Tim’s a remarkable individual. And remarkable individuals can be contentious.” In the podcast hosted by the Cornish performer and artist Seamas Carey, Smit bemoaned the fact that people who spoke about Cornwall were sometimes criticised as “arrogant” if they were not Cornish themselves. Smit, who was born in the Netherlands and moved to Cornwall in 1987, said: “You feel like saying, well if you were a bit more fucking articulate you could speak up yourself.” He went on: “You’ve all got mums who made the best pasties in the world and it’s fantastic and it’s fabulous and you talk about the good old days and the good old days never were the good old days. They’ve been bad for about 70 years and they’ve been bad because of tossers like you and that’s what I would actually say to quite a lot of Cornish people. “I really would because you cannot define your life in terms of what you don’t like. You’ve got to actually define your life sometimes in terms of the sunny uplands you would like to aspire to.” On Thursday Smit told the Guardian that he took part in the podcast for a family friend and was “off-guard”, chatting as if he was in a pub. He admitted he “went off on one” but said: “The idea that I’m anti-Cornish is as far off the mark as it could possibly be.” Smit said he regretted using the word “tossers”. But he added: “I’m not racist. It was a type of Cornish approach I was talking about.” Andrew George, a Cornish Liberal Democrat councillor, called it an “astonishing rant”. He said: “The Cornish have always been the last refuge for this kind of ‘acceptable’ racism. He knows he can get away with it because there are enough who share his lazy caricature of Cornish people and the prejudice and antipathy which accompanies it.” Joanie Willett, the co-director of the Institute of Cornish Studies, said the cheerful, holiday image people had of Cornwall made it harder for residents’ real experiences to be seen and heard. “We are not inarticulate, it’s that our story is not being heard,” she said. “We do try to define ourselves in terms of our sunny uplands. But that voice gets drowned out.” There were some backers for Smit. Kim Conchie, the chief executive of Cornwall Chamber of Commerce, said he must have been feeling “grouchy” when he did the interview but added that people like Smit and Rick Stein had helped Cornwall get its “mojo” back. Bert Biscoe, a Cornish politician, historian and bard of the Cornish Gorseth, which exists to maintain the Celtic spirit of Cornwall, said Smit had over-stated Cornish people’s inclination to be negative. He sais he was glad the comments had led to debate, before adding: “But he could have been a little more polite.”",News/UK news,‘Lazy caricature’: St Austell reacts to Tim Smit’s rant about Cornish people,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/17/lazy-caricature-st-austell-reacts-to-tim-smits-rant-about-cornish-people
2/18/2022,"South Africa’s potential move to join the Six Nations could spark a bidding war to host the British & Irish Lions in 2033 with Argentina, Japan and the US among the possible candidates. The Lions are due to travel to Australia in 2025 but there is no agreement in place as to where they will subsequently play after their multi-tour deal came to an end after their drawn series in New Zealand in 2017. The All Blacks are still expected to host the Lions in 2029 but with South Africa exploring the option of joining the Six Nations after 2025, the 2033 tour destination is less certain.  Last summer’s maligned series against South Africa was arranged as a one-off with a new commercial partnership for that tour only and afterwards the Lions’ managing director, Ben Calveley, said that future deals would be done on a “tour-by-tour” basis. “There is no long-term commitment to anyone,” he said. “We do a tour-by-tour deal depending on the conditions that prevail on our end.” Calveley also stated that the Lions were not looking to deviate from the traditional model of rotating between the Springboks, Australia and New Zealand but South Africa joining the Six Nations would make them a far less attractive proposition. That, in turn, could pave the way for the Lions to break new ground. Both Argentina, in 2005, and Japan at Murrayfield last summer have played against the Lions before and given that the commercial benefits of staging a Lions tour are huge for the host nation, they would not be short on bidders. The US are the frontrunners to host the 2031 World Cup and hosting the Lions tour years later would be the ideal next step in their progression. The Lions have not employed a bidding process before but did not rule out doing so in the future after the 2021 tour. Meanwhile, proposals for South Africa to replace Italy in the Six Nations – as opposed to joining a seven-team competition – have been rejected by a well-placed source in Italy, where a plan for an expanded tournament with the Springboks joining the existing teams is considered a more likely outcome.",Sport/Sport,South Africa joining Six Nations would create bidding war for 2033 Lions,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/17/japan-and-the-us-could-bid-to-host-lions-in-2033-if-south-africa-join-six-nations
2/18/2022,"The UK competition watchdog is teaming up with its counterparts in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand in a drive to detect and investigate collusion between suppliers or shipping groups to hike prices. The Competition and Markets Authority said it was linking up with its fellow agencies in other “five eyes” nations after receiving “multiple complaints” from businesses about supply chains, where, for example, fees for shipping have soared by up to 10 times, compared with pre-pandemic levels, in the past two years. The CMA said that despite the complaints it was yet to find evidence of potential breaches of the law.  A new working group made up of the US Department of Justice, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the Canadian Competition Bureau and the New Zealand Commerce Commission is set to “meet regularly to develop and share intelligence to detect and investigate suspected anti-competitive behaviour and collusion”. The agencies released a coordinated statement saying they were “putting firms on notice that those attempting to use supply chain disruptions as a cover for illegal anticompetitive conduct, including collusion, will face the full force of the law”. It is understood the remit is broad, covering sectors including retail, healthcare and agriculture. In the UK, businesses found to be colluding could be fined up to 10% of global turnover and directors could be disqualified or in some cases face criminal prosecution. Michael Grenfell, the executive director of enforcement at the CMA, urged anyone aware of anti-competitive behaviour to contact the watchdog’s cartels hotline. He said: “People and businesses across the world have been facing higher prices for goods and for transporting them. “While price rises can be legitimate, the CMA would be concerned if collusive anti-competitive practices are contributing to these rises or preventing prices from coming down. “The CMA is ready to use its legal powers where it finds evidence that the issues in the supply chain might be caused by potential breaches of competition law. “These are global issues that are best addressed together. With support and intelligence from partner agencies across the world, we can step in and take enforcement action if we find evidence of anti-competitive behaviour taking place.” Businesses have been warning for some time of the impact of the surging cost of moving goods, which is partly responsible for inflation in the cost of goods and a squeeze on household spending. MakeUK, which represents the manufacturing industry, and the British Chambers of Commerce, wrote last autumn to the CMA, asking it to look into the world’s biggest shipping companies and whether soaring costs could be justified. Their complaints came as the biggest global shipping firms were expected to make extraordinary profits in 2021. The CMA told industry groups it would monitor the situation, but informed them it was not able to address the price rises unilaterally, because shipping costs were “the product of multiple factors, often international in nature”.",News/Business,UK regulator joins five-nation effort against supply chain price hikes,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/17/uk-regulator-joins-five-nation-effort-against-supply-chain-price-hikes
2/18/2022,"Swiftly doing away with any extraneous guff, the title of Channing Tatum’s to-the-point co-directorial debut Dog doesn’t need a journey, a way home or even a purpose, it just needs a dog. So dog lovers eager for a dog movie primarily about a dog will be reassured by the knowledge that Dog does feature plenty of dog but they might be a little surprised about what else the film has to offer, an odd and atonal ramble across the US where the dog comes first and plotting comes a long way after.  It’s been four years since we’ve seen Tatum on screen, (he’s been heard in a couple of animated films since 2017) and Dog is a slickly calculated comeback vehicle, as calculated as they come. He gets to be macho but sensitive, shirtless but sometimes merely wet-shirted and, most importantly, he gets to frolic with a cute dog, a hard-to-resist Belgian shepherd called Lulu, partly inspired by his real pet Lulu who died three years ago. Tatum plays an army ranger suckered into transporting his late friend’s difficult dog to his funeral. Both man and mutt have been traumatised by their time serving overseas and the long drive ahead gives them both a chance to learn something from the other in between a series of increasingly bizarre run-ins. For while the general structure of Dog is as basic as its title, the tone is far harder to figure out, a warm-hearted family film striving for a hip edge, the question of who this is for being asked on a loop throughout. The scrapes the pair get into include a failed tantric threesome with two women in Portland, a kidnap on a weed farm involving a tranquilliser and an axe and a racist attack at a high-end hotel leading to time behind bars. The script, from co-director and long-time Tatum collaborator Reid Carolin and former soldier Brett Rodriguez, is both strange and sanitised, caught between appealing to younger kids and also to their much older brothers; what if dog movie but cool. Whatever the aim of this all might have been, it’s muddied with every new escalation. The aforementioned racist incident is a particular flub, with Tatum’s character feigning blindness to get a fancy room for him and his dog, who is then triggered by the sight of a Middle Eastern man and so attacks him. There’s a way this could have been handled with some delicacy and interrogation (what sort of racial profiling has infected the instincts of some army-trained dogs?) but it’s in the centre of an absurd comic set piece, and all it does is remind us that while the film takes ample time to focus on the crippling PTSD experienced by many US soldiers (one of the script’s finest and most sensitive qualities, mind), there’s no effort to remind us of the other side of that equation. It’s not handled with the horror it deserves or even that much embarrassment from Tatum’s character. It’s just another weird thing that happens in a movie full of weird things. While a reliably commanding Tatum works well with the dog (he’s clearly a devoted dog owner), the script leaps past too many of the pair’s key milestones together. We’re told, and shown, that Lulu is violent and impossible from the outset but there’s not quite enough legwork involved in showing us how he manages to tame her (a brief, batty episode involving Jane Adams establishing a psychic connection to her does not suffice) and it’s one of many lazy A to C pole vaults the film does to rush us toward the finale. It’s a collection of uneven episodes – a wordless Q’orianka Kilcher and a racist Bill Burr also briefly crop up – stitched together by copious shots of Tatum sitting on his car in a tight T-shirt next to a sunset. Dog wants to be that sturdy plane movie you find hard to surf past when you see it on cable in the ensuing years and while it looks and sounds the part (Thomas Newman score – check), there’s not the slick storytelling and big emotional beats to match. It might be a pet project for Tatum but it’s a rough ride for the rest of us.

2/18/2022,"In government, words come cheap, but it is deeds and actions that count. Judged by the threats that Boris Johnson and his ministers make against Russia over Ukraine, you might think that Britain is fully equipped to turn its warnings into deeds. Not so. When it comes to something British ministers really could control, however, like targeting the assets of Kremlin-backed oligarchs and staunching the flows of Russian-tainted money laundered through the City of London, the rhetoric runs into the sand. In this sphere, Mr Johnson’s government does the exact reverse of what is needed. It speaks loudly, but it carries a flimsy stick. Now, there is some prospect of action. The UK is reported to be ready to abolish its “golden visa” regime within weeks. But why so late? And how effective will this reform really be now? The fear is that it is too little, too late and too ineffectual, and that it will prove another underresourced performative stunt designed to create an impression, not achieve a material economic goal.  The investor visa scheme, launched in 1994, under which foreign nationals must show they have at least £2m ready to invest in the UK, has been one of the keys to opening up Britain as a safe haven for dirty money from Russia – and from elsewhere too (in 2021 more than twice as many golden visas were issued to Chinese nationals than to Russians). The scheme did not just bring in money. It became the seedbed for an industry of UK enablers – including lawyers, accountants, estate agents, security specialists and lobbyists – to help integrate Russian oligarchs and others into many levels of British life, including the Conservative party. Some of the golden visa scheme’s conditions were tightened in 2015 and 2019. There has been no lack of calls for stronger action, and repeated evidence that ministers do not see this as a priority. Yet economic crime is not just theft. It is also a national security issue. In 2018, the Commons foreign affairs committee warned that Britain was not serious about the subject. In 2020, the intelligence and security committee said that London “offered ideal mechanisms by which illicit finance could be recycled through what has been referred to as the London ‘laundromat’”. Only last month, the Treasury minister Lord Agnew resigned in frustration because a much-delayed economic crime bill has been left out of the next Queen’s speech. That decision shows where the government’s priorities lie. In the tension between its prosperity agenda and security against Russia and other threats, it is the Treasury – and the Tory party treasurer – that too often gets the last word. In January, a US thinktank warned that any US-UK counter-kleptocracy drive would be hampered by the close ties between Russian money and elite UK institutions, including the Tory party. This week, the former Tory minister Lord Faulks told the Guardian that Britain had become a laughing stock as a result of “a deluded desire to protect the City of London”. The recent shift towards renewed deregulation in the internal balance of power in the Tory party suggests that this will not change soon. Yet it should. Action against the City’s role in money laundering is massively overdue. But the abolition of golden visas is a gesture, not a strategy. It is a scattergun approach affecting all foreign nationals of whatever background, when what is really needed is a ruthless and properly resourced targeting of assets and investors with links to hostile regimes like Russia. If Ukraine is invaded, the case for action will be even stronger. But the measures need to be effective and thorough to have any effect now.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on ending ‘golden visas’: too little and too late | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/17/the-guardian-view-on-ending-golden-visas-too-little-and-too-late
2/18/2022,"Libraries are romantic yet prosaic places. The romance is that of reading, and the wealth of human imagining and learning that is contained in them. Access to the knowledge and literary art (poetry, fiction, drama) in a library is precious, priceless – and particularly valuable to young minds and people of any age with an interest in education. “The library was the place I went to find out what there was to know. It was absolutely essential,” said the novelist Zadie Smith of her own early life. The prosaic side of libraries is more physical. This is the world of buildings, shelving, books as objects, library cards, fines, computers – and people with bodies that take up space as well as minds that can be opened. It would be hard to find anyone who actively disapproves of libraries, and the principles of self-improvement and pleasure that they stand for. But when it comes to practicalities, Britain’s libraries are on less solid ground. The sector has been cut massively in the past decade, with around 800 libraries across England, Scotland and Wales disappearing.  The first Covid lockdown prompted a new surge of interest in reading, as the idea took hold that people forced to stay at home would spend more time with their noses in books – both finding out more about viral pandemics and escaping from them. But the latest data regarding libraries is sobering reading for anyone who values them as bricks-and-mortar places to go, and as places to sit, use the internet, or seek advice from a librarian – as well as databases. The number of books borrowed in the year ending in March 2021 was 72.9m, down 56% on the previous year. Physical visits also collapsed, from 214.6m to 59.7m, with a glint of silver lining in the fact that website visits grew by 18% to 154.7m. Of course, this is the behaviour that one would expect during a pandemic. Many libraries were closed during this period, while people were discouraged from unnecessary mixing. Book sales climbed to their highest in a decade in 2021, with fiction especially buoyant, which suggests that some former users of libraries may have bought books instead. Private libraries at home, whether large collections or single, cluttered bookshelves, appear to be flourishing. But the hope must be that visits and loans at public libraries will soon return to their former level too. Like any other service, libraries need users. And while booksellers might in one sense be regarded as rivals, in fact the vast majority of those involved in the trade, from publishers to poets, are library lovers – as can be seen from the volumes they have inspired, from Susan Orlean’s The Library Book to Matt Haig’s The Midnight Library. This has something to do with the romantic notion of the reader as explorer, with every book (or at least a good number of them) a door to a new store of feeling or understanding. But it also embodies the recognition that if books are to form part of our mutual life, there must be space in the public realm for them. Books can be treasured possessions, but there is also something special about a copy that arrives in your hands having passed through those of others – and that will go on being passed between strangers who share your curiosity.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on libraries: bring back borrowers | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/17/the-guardian-view-on-libraries-bring-back-borrowers
