1/9/2022,"Former President Donald Trump canceled a press conference on the anniversary of the Capitol riot. Newsweek reports that he spent the day at home furiously watching the commemorative events on cable news. He referred to the events commemorating the insurrection as the ""Biden-Pelosi show,"" a friend told Newsweek. Former President Donald Trump spent January 6, 2022, at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, watching cable news and getting angry, according to Newsweek. Citing a friend of the former president, Newsweek said that Trump spent all day ""stewing"" at home while cable news shows broadcast events commemorating the first anniversary of the Capitol riot. And while he didn't watch all of the events, the friend told Newsweek, what he did see made him ""furious."" Trump dubbed the events, led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and featuring a speech by President Joe Biden, as the ""Biden-Pelosi show,"" per the friend. According to another source close to Trump, the former president's contempt for Biden was intensified by his speech, Newsweek said sIn a statement, the former president slammed Biden's speech as a piece of ""political theater"" to distract from his failures. He also said that Biden used his name to ""try to further divide America."" He accused Biden of trying to ""deflect the incompetent job"" he is doing. ""That's what you get when you have a rigged Election,"" in another statement. According to Newsweek, Trump's friends say that the former president obsesses over debunked conspiracies about the election having been rigged. ""The reason he is so fixated on the so-called stolen election is that he still can't believe he lost to that guy,"" said one friend. He's also fixated on how the public views him concerning January 6, Newsweek said, ""He pretty much obsesses about criticism 24/7,"" a friend told the media outlet. Trump had initially planned to hold a press conference at Mar-a-Lago on the anniversary of the Capitol attack but abruptly canceled it two days before the event. As Insider previously reported, he blamed what he called the ""total bias and dishonesty of the January 6th Unselect Committee of Democrats, two failed Republicans, and the Fake News Media."" But reports say that family members and political allies had warned him the press conference would backfire. While playing golf at Mar-a-Lago, Sen. Lindsay Graham had advised that there would be little upside to holding it, Newsweek reported.
