3/7/2022,"A Russian oligarch told the captain of his yacht to sail from France to Turkey ASAP, per the WSJ. Igor Sechin's yacht was docked in France when he was sanctioned after Russia invaded Ukraine. French authorities tied the yacht down so it couldn't leave, a customs officer told WSJ. Russian billionaire and oligarch Igor Sechin told the captain of his now-seized superyacht to leave a French port and sail to Turkey as fast as possible after he was hit with sanctions, The Wall Street Journal reported. The US and the European Union put Sechin, who is said to be a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, on their sanctions lists shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine. Sechin is also known as Russia's ""Darth Vader."" The reported account of Sechin's orders offers a glimpse into how the wealthiest Russians who were targeted by sanctions sought to move their superyachts and private jets across the world after the invasion of Ukraine in order to protect their assets. Eric Salles, a lead officer on the seizure operation, said in an interview with the Journal that French customs officers found out last week that the yacht was preparing to leave the French town of La Ciotat despite having repair works scheduled. Customs officers also heard the yacht was owned by Sechin, CEO of Russian state-controlled oil giant Rosneft, Salles added. The customs officers went to the yacht and questioned the captain, Salles said in the interview. The captain told officers that he had orders to leave the French port and ""sail to Turkey as quickly as possible,"" Salles told the Journal. After hearing this information, French authorities tied the superyacht to the quay with steel rope slings so it couldn't leave, Salles told the Journal. Officers proceeded to check documents, further question the captain and crew, and surveil the vessel 24/7, Salles added. Sechin's yacht was officially seized by the authorities on Wednesday night, according to a press release tweeted by French finance minister Bruno Le Maire. The yacht's captain — still onboard the vessel with other crew members — wasn't arrested, Salles told the Journal. Sechin is among the number of high-profile Russian business executives which have been sanctioned by the EU, US, UK and others because of their ties to Putin. Gennady Timchenko, a Putin confidant, and Alexei Mordashov, the wealthiest man in Russia, had their superyachts seized by officials in Italy, the Associated Press reported on Friday.

3/7/2022,"It’s time to celebrate, Idaho, so cut yourself an extra-large piece of cake. Make it angel food. And chase it with a bottle of O’Doul’s. For the first time in the history of humankind, Idaho officially can declare itself America’s least sinful state. That’s according to an annual study from WalletHub, the personal finance website that invents a ranking for everything. Its new article, “2022’s Most Sinful States in America,” places Idaho at the absolute bottom of the list: No. 50. We out-goody-two-shoed our prissy, sanctimonious Utah neighbors by a whopping eight spots. Go jump in a Salt Lake, sinners! WalletHub says it compared all of the states “across 47 key indicators of immoral or illicit behavior. Our data set ranges from violent crimes per capita to excessive drinking to the share of the population with gambling disorders.” Here’s where the Gem State finished in the major categories — 1 being most sinful, 50 being least sinful: ▪ Anger & Hatred: 41st ▪ Jealousy: 50th ▪ Excesses & Vices: 36th ▪ Greed: 38th ▪ Lust: 41st ▪ Vanity: 41st ▪ Laziness: 30th What makes us so morally superior in Idaho? Is it our willingness to suffer with a smile — and an alcohol ban — during 100-degree days on the Boise River? Is it the fact that Boise strip clubs actually are “bikini” bars? No nudity allowed. By law. By God! Is it the fact that the Gem State will never, ever, ever legalize the devil’s lettuce? Not even for medical reasons? No clue. I’m too busy adjusting my halo in the mirror to worry about that stuff. So which state is the most sinful? Unsurprisingly, that brothel-loving, gambling-ravaged gutter Nevada. (I haven’t set foot there in, like, four months.) What’s worrisome, though? The runner-up for most sinful state is California. Right behind Nevada. How much longer can Idaho maintain its innocence with all those depraved Golden Staters invading our pristine land? If things get bad, we could all just move next door to Oregon. Despite its billion pot shops and nudie bars, Oregon is a respectable No. 35 on the list. Which does bring the entire exercise into question. Incidentally, if you feel like you’ve read this column before? You sorta have. We Idahoans have come very close to being the least sinful state — No. 3 in 2020, No. 5 in 2019. I’ve run out of ideas on how to write about it, so I just recycle. And it’s impossible for me to plagiarize off myself. It wouldn’t be a sin, anyway. After all, I’m an Idahoan.",U.S./Idaho Statesman,"Utah, stick this in your pipe and smoke it!

3/7/2022,"Trump likely doesn't care if his election-fraud claims are true, Bill Barr told NBC News. Barr wrote in his book that Trump just cared about not being seen as a loser, per the outlet. Trump blasted Barr over the interview, the latest example of one of his allies turning on him. Former President Donald Trump is not interested in the truth of whether the 2020 presidential election was stolen, and just cares about not being considered a loser, according to his former Attorney General Bill Barr. In an interview aired on Sunday night, Barr told NBC News that he didn't believe Trump was ""fixated"" on actually proving his false election-fraud claims. ""I think his attitude probably is: 'It either was stolen, or if it wasn't stolen I want people to believe it was stolen,'"" Barr told the network. There is no evidence that Trump's claims are right. A series of legal challenges to voting tallies around the US failed to make any headway in the courts. ""It's useful. I'm not sure he's, you know, really fixated on finding out what the truth is there."" The interview was the latest example of a Trump official turning on their former boss since leaving office. As with others, in prompted a furious response from Trump. Barr described Trump's attitude to the fraud claims in response to a question about a claim he made in his recently-released book, ""One Damn Thing After Another."" In the book, he wrote that Trump would never concede the election because in his world, ""a loser was the lowest form of life,"" according to NBC News. Barr, once a Trump loyalist, resigned over the false election-fraud claims in December 2020. When Barr announced publicly that he had seen no evidence of fraud, Trump was ""the maddest I'd ever seen him,"" Barr told the outlet in comments released last week ahead of the full interview. Despite a recount in Arizona and multiple lawsuits, no evidence of widespread fraud has been found since the election. One of the lawyers Trump turned to to secure this evidence, such as former New York Mayor General Rudy Giuliani, was described as a ""clown show"" by Barr in his interview. Giuliani is now embroiled in multi-billion-dollar defamation lawsuits with voting technology companies Dominion and Smartmatic. Nonetheless, Trump continues to falsely claim the election was stolen, as he did in a pre-emptive rebuttal to the interview. The response, seemingly prepared long before the interview aired, was tweeted late Sunday by his spokesperson Liz Harrington. In a three-page statement dated March 2 and address to Barr's interviewer Lester Holt, Trump blasted Barr as ""weak"" and said he ""wouldn't know voter fraud if it was staring him in the face."" Insider contacted Harrington for comment and did not receive an immediate reply.

3/7/2022,"TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) — They railed against politicians, conducted military-style exercises and spoke darkly of confronting tyrants scheming to seize their guns and enslave them. Yet historian JoEllen Vinyard says the “citizen militia"" activists she got to know in the 1990s didn't seem like the types who would abduct a governor or stage a coup. “I don't think they were dangerous,"" said Vinyard, an Eastern Michigan University professor emeritus and author of a book about far-right movements in the state. “They reminded me of the good old boys I knew growing up in Nebraska."" But as four men charged with conspiring to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer go on trial Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Grand Rapids, Vinyard and other political extremism scholars say things have changed in recent years. Their arrests came about three months before the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection that led to charges against many right-wing extremists and militants. In contrast to militants from before, who mostly avoided bloodshed with the horrific exception of the Oklahoma City bombing, some modern successors have taken a more radical and potentially violent turn. “This is a different type of domestic terrorism phenomenon than we've faced in previous decades — completely different from anything I've observed,” said Javed Ali, a University of Michigan professor who served with the FBI and intelligence agencies. “You've got all these points on a very diverse threat spectrum — not centralized in any one corner, no single groups, no national leadership, completely disorganized and disaggregated,” Ali said. “It's difficult for law enforcement to spot these threats. The Whitmer plot is a case in point."" The alleged kidnapping conspiracy involved members of a little-known cell called the “Wolverine Watchmen” and others who attended a July 2020 meeting in Ohio of self-styled “militia” leaders from several states, according to court documents. They were angry about pandemic lockdowns and other policies they considered dictatorial, investigators said. Some had joined a protest months earlier at the Michigan Capitol in Lansing, where armed demonstrators faced off with police and some carried guns into the Senate gallery. Federal prosecutors in October 2020 charged six suspects in the alleged plot, including Ty Garbin and Kaleb Franks, who have pleaded guilty. Garbin received a six-year prison term; Franks will be sentenced later. The other four defendants are Adam Fox, Daniel Harris, Brandon Caserta and Barry Croft Jr. All are Michigan residents except Croft, who is from Delaware. Eight other men accused of aiding the conspiracy have been charged in state court. The Wolverine Watchmen  are among the small, secretive groups that have appeared in Michigan since the initial burst of paramilitary activism faded, Ali said. They began recruiting members on Facebook in November 2019 and communicated through an encrypted messaging platform, according to a state police affidavit. It said they held firearms training and tactical drills to prepare for “the boogaloo,“ an anticipated ""uprising against the government or impending politically motivated civil war.” The scheme against Whitmer was hatched the following summer during a meeting at which Watchmen discussed invading the statehouse and using explosives to distract law enforcement, Garbin acknowledged in his plea agreement. They considered executing the Democratic governor or putting her on trial, eventually deciding to abduct her at her family’s vacation home in northern Michigan, the document said. Informants and undercover agents helped foil the alleged plot. Vinyard, who attended meetings of self-described militia groups in southeastern Michigan for her research during the 1990s, said threatening language was rare then. Members had long lists of grievances, some targeting the United Nations and a federal government they believed had exceeded its constitutional authority, she said. But others involved local law enforcement and courts. “People talked about police harassment, truckers getting stopped by cops, fathers who had not been treated fairly when they got divorced and couldn't see their kids,” she said. Norman Olson, an Air Force veteran, gun shop owner and Baptist preacher who initially led the Michigan Militia, said then its members were outraged by deadly sieges involving federal agents at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, and Waco, Texas. The militia drew international attention after the 1995 bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building, which killed 168 people. Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, convicted in the case, had attended meetings in Michigan. Olson said they'd been kicked out for advocating violence. By the early 2000s the movement appeared to lose steam, experts said, perhaps because of public revulsion over the bombing, internal strife, the presidency of gun-friendly George W. Bush and a crackdown on terrorism after the 9/11 attacks. Following President Barack Obama's election, it resurfaced on a wave of right-wing populism embodied by the Tea Party movement and Donald Trump that crested amid fury at COVID-19 restrictions. In 2010, the FBI charged nine members of a fundamentalist Christian sect in southeastern Michigan called Hutaree with conspiring to rebel against the government. The judge dismissed most of the case, but it signaled what some observers describe as the rise of a more incendiary segment of the far right. Even other paramilitary groups were uneasy with the Hutaree and notified authorities, according to a paper by Vanderbilt University sociologist Amy Cooter, who studies right-wing militancy. Lee Miracle, a longtime leader of the Southeast Michigan Volunteer Militia, urged restraint in a statement on the group's website after the Wolverine Watchmen arrests in 2020. “Our capacity for violence, as a free people, should always be well maintained, and kept within reach, but it should always be the LAST option,"" said Miracle, who did not return an email seeking additional comment. But organizations that track the more belligerent groups say they've made inroads in Michigan, which has an extensive history as a far-right breeding ground. The nonprofit Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project says among the most active are newcomers such as the Boogaloo Boys and the Proud Boys, a self-described “Western chauvinist” association. Another is the Michigan Liberty Militia, which had a visible presence at the state Capitol protest. The movement has splintered into many factions over the years because of leadership rivalries and ideological differences, said retired FBI agent Greg Stejskal, who dealt with the Michigan Militia in its early days. Still, it has remained overwhelmingly white, male and rooted in conspiratorial fear of losing guns and freedom. “They feel like they're subjugated, and this is their way of fighting back,"" he said. They've kept a somewhat lower profile since the kidnapping arrests and the invasion of the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters seeking to overturn the 2020 election, said Rachel Goldwasser, a research analyst with the nonprofit Southern Poverty Law Center. The outcome of the Michigan conspiracy trial, she said, may “indicate whether they stay in their foxholes or come out as a force in public again."" ___ Find AP’s full coverage of the Whitmer kidnap plot trial at: https://apnews.com/hub/whitmer-kidnap-plot-trial ___ Follow John Flesher on Twitter: www.twitter.com/johnflesher",U.S./Associated Press,Experts: Alleged plot against governor signals ominous shift,https://news.yahoo.com/experts-alleged-plot-against-governor-151402604.html
3/7/2022,"What started out as curious markings slapped in white paint on Russian tanks and trucks has now become a symbol of Vladimir Putin’s own version of World War Z. Now, the “Z” has become akin to a new “swastika” or symbol of hatred and is showing up everywhere supporters of Russia’s uninvited invasion of Ukraine can be found. Kamil Galeev, a Galina Starovoitova Fellow at Woodrow Wilson Center, has been curating examples of the creepy character’s use on Twitter. “‘Z’ is a letter that Russian Military are putting on their vehicles departing to Ukraine. Some interpret ‘Z’ as ‘Za pobedy’ (for victory). Others - as ‘Zapad’ (West). Anyway, this symbol invented just a few days ago became a symbol of new Russian ideology and national identity,” he tweeted before the invasion. Now Galeev believes the symbol means Putin has taken a page out of the world’s worst tyrants, including Benito Mussolini. “To put it simply, it’s going full fascist,” he tweeted. “Authorities launched a propaganda campaign to gain popular support for their invasion of Ukraine and they're getting lots of it.” Indeed, the symbol, which is likely not directly tied to Mussolini’s fasces symbol which also sported a “Z” any more than it is a reference to the 2013 Brad Pitt film “World War Z” which premiered at the Moscow film festival that year—though it could be argued that Russian troops are not so different from the zombie invasion the film is based on. But it certainly is gaining popular appeal. Over the weekend Russian gymnast Ivan Kuliak was seen wearing a white “Z” on his leotard as he stood next to Ukraine’s Kovtun Illia, who had just won the gold in the Gymnastics World Cup event in Doha. Business owners put ""Z"" - showing their support of invasion on their trucks. Here you see a funeral service fully endorsing Z message pic.twitter.com/NM43dO1SrZ — Kamil Galeev (@kamilkazani) March 6, 2022 Severely ill Russian children at a cancer center in the city of Kazan were reportedly made to line up in the “Z” formation for a photograph that has been widely distributed in social media. The badges of dead Ukrainian soldiers have also been photographed lined up in the “Z” formation, and the letter has shown up on flags, on trucks, and in convoys of supposed supporters of Putin’s war. Here you see terminally ill children from hospice and their parents making a Z formation. Yes, Russians are forcing terminally ill children dying from cancer, and their families to declare their support to Russian invasion of Ukraine. See letters Детский хоспис? Hospice for Kids pic.twitter.com/3yeHMPWXl0 — Kamil Galeev (@kamilkazani) March 6, 2022 There is even a video of Russian spy Marina Butina, who pleaded guilty in 2018 to conspiracy to act as a foreign agent, drawing one on the lapel of her jacket. It is difficult to say if the letter, which may have been first used to simply identify Russian military hardware to distinguish them from Ukrainian machines, has any other hidden meaning. The letter “Z” does not exist in Cyrillic Russian script, but it has now become the most prominent symbol of Russia’s senseless war. Read more at The Daily Beast.
