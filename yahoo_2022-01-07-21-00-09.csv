1/7/2022,"TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan is to step up coronavirus restrictions in three regions that host U.S. military bases to stem a COVID-19 surge that some officials have said the bases have helped fuel. The restrictions, which authorities call ""priority measures"", are being brought back for the first time since September, when Japan lifted emergency controls that had prevailed across the country for most of last year. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told a meeting the measures, which will allow steps such as limiting the operating hours of restaurants and bars, were needed to rein in surging cases. The infectious Omicron variant has been found in about 80% of Japanese prefectures. Total new infections will exceed 5,000 on Friday, the Yomiuri newspaper reported, compared with an average of about 200 a day last month. ""We must be prepared for the rapid spread of infection,"" Health Minister Shigeyuki Goto told reporters. ""There are cases where there is no history of overseas travel and the route of infection is unknown, while the Delta strain also continues to spread."" The new measures in the southern prefecture of Okinawa and the western prefectures of Hiroshima and Yamaguchi, will last from Sunday to the end of the month. All three regions host bases for the U.S. military, which on Thursday announced stricter infection controls at Japan's urging after outbreaks at bases appeared to have spilled into communities. Governors of the prefectures had requested the tougher measures after seeing a surge in cases driven by the Omicron variant. The southern island chain of Okinawa, host to 70% of U.S. military facilities in Japan, has been the hardest hit, in what appears to be the country's sixth wave of the pandemic. The prefecture reported 1,414 new cases on Friday, a record and up from 981 on Thursday. ""This number will likely stay high and steadily increase,"" said Okinawa Governor Denny Tamaki, who has harshly criticised infection controls at U.S. bases. Infections have also been on the rise in major metropolitan areas. Tokyo said it found 922 new cases on Friday, the most since Sept. 15. Tokyo's government is planning to strengthen countermeasures by directing restaurants to limit diners to groups of four, down from eight, the Kyodo news agency reported.

1/7/2022,"Coyotes are sort of nature’s version of ill-mannered teens — awkward in any crowd — and a trail camera video recorded in Arizona is proving their uncouth reputation may be deserved. It’s a minute long, and hints of drama by showing a large coyote appearing to track an unsuspecting bobcat to a watering hole. Both species are not afraid to defend themselves, so it’s easy to assume a fight is brewing. However, what viewers get depends on their tolerance for bathroom humor. First, the bobcat drinks, then saunters away. Then the coyote arrives, takes a refreshing sip — and hikes one leg to shamelessly urinate in the water bowl. Several thousand people have viewed the video since it was posted Jan. 2 on YouTube’s AZ Desert Critters channel, and they all seem to agree the coyote deserves a good slap upside the head. “What a jerk,” Rebecca Cartwright wrote. “Just rude,” Laura Holbert posted. The video was recorded Dec. 29 near Tucson by part-time pet photographer Keith Cannataro. He says the two animals were about 10 seconds apart in real time, and the coyote’s decision to pee in the water took him off guard, too. “This was the first time I recall seeing a bobcat and coyote so close together. Being just one coyote, I didn’t think it would try anything with the bobcat,” he told McClatchy News. “I gather from other people that this is some sort of (territory) marking. I jokingly mentioned that maybe the coyote was aiming for the side of the water dish and as we males know, sometimes our aim in not perfect.” Cannataro says he put out the water for wildlife in May, during a period of extreme drought in the state. His videos on the AZ Desert Critters page include javelina squadron, badgers and rattlesnakes appearing to lie in wait for prey at the watering hole. In one video, recorded in September, he captured a coyote realizing just in time it was walking straight at a rattlesnake. The coyote is seen backing up and walking around the reptile.
