1/18/2022,"KEMMERER, Wyoming (AP) — In this sleepy Wyoming town that has relied on coal for over a century, a company founded by the man who revolutionized personal computing is launching an ambitious project to counter climate change: A nationwide reboot of nuclear energy technology. Until recently, Kemmerer was little-known for anything except J.C. Penney's first store and some 55-million-year-old fish fossils in quarries down the road. Then in November, a company started by Bill Gates, TerraPower, announced it had chosen Kemmerer for a nontraditional, sodium-cooled nuclear reactor that will bring on workers from a local coal-fired power plant scheduled to close soon. The demonstration project comes as many U.S. states see nuclear emerging as an answer to fill the gap as a transition away from coal, oil and natural gas to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Many residents in Kemmerer, where the population of 2,700 is little-changed since the 1990s, see the TerraPower project as a much-needed economic boost because Rocky Mountain Power's Naughton power plant will close 2025. The plant employs about 230 and a mine that supplies coal exclusively to the plant — and is also at risk of closing if it can't find another customer — almost 300. “Kemmerer needs something or it’ll become a dust bowl,” said Ken Spears, a 69-year-old retired coal mine worker whose family has depended on the mine and power plant for generations. Spears was among a group of men who gathered recently in a downtown bar, Grumpies, near a park with statue of James Cash Penney and his first store. They played pool near an antique piano and signs reading “Let’s go Brandon” and “Trump 2020 No More Bull..."" Kemmerer is a quaint town of old-time storefronts and rolling hills, off the beaten path other than for occasional tourists who pass through on a slower, more scenic route to Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks. Residents speak proudly of the coal heritage, quiet lifestyle and easy access to open lands where they can fish, hunt and hike. A river that is iced over in the winter runs through town nearby a railroad track that is down the hill from neighborhoods of older houses where families of deer roam at sunset. Wyoming has the biggest coal industry in the U.S. by far. Trump won the state with some of his highest margins, almost 70%, in 2016 and 2020 on promises to shore up coal mining. Yet concerns about TerraPower's unusual, coal-replacing nuclear plant seem few and far between in this town. “This isn’t a Chernobyl-type thing,” said Spears, wearing a camouflaged jacket and University of Wyoming cap with the bucking-horse-and-rider logo. “Kemmerer needs something.” The U.S. nuclear industry has been at a standstill, providing a steady 20% of the nation’s power for decade amid the costly and time-consuming process of building huge conventional nuclear plants. Only one new commercial nuclear project, the Tennessee Valley Authority’s Watts Bar No. 2, has come online in the U.S. in the past 25 years. By cooling the planned Kemmerer reactor with liquid sodium, a metal that boils at a temperature much higher than water and solidifies at well above room temperature, TerraPower says its relatively small, 345-megawatt plant, able to power about 345,000 homes, will be safe and less expensive than conventional, water-cooled nuclear plants. The company's Natrium plant will use a simpler and less expensive system of unpressurized coolant and vents not dependent on electricity to halt fission during an emergency. The approach isn’t new. Russia has had a commercial sodium-cooled reactor in use at full capacity since 2016 and such designs have been tested in the U.S. TerraPower plans to make its plant useful for today's energy grid of growing renewable power. A salt heat “battery” will allow the plant to ramp up electricity production on demand, offsetting dips in electricity when the wind isn’t blowing and sun isn’t shining. “It should provide a more useful reactor, really, for operating on a grid that has a much greater amount of wind and solar than in the past,"" said TerraPower President and CEO Chris Levesque. At peak capacity, the plant could generate 500 megawatts, enough for 500,000 homes, he said. The project will cost up to $4 billion, half of it from the U.S. Department of Energy, but costs should come down as demand for carbon-free energy grows and more are built, said Levesque. “If we can show that the plant can be built affordably and on time, we’ll have orders for additional Natrium reactors even before the first one starts up. In the 2030s, there will be massive demand for this kind of power,"" Levesque said. One downside: The plant's fuel, at least at first, would need to come from Russia. The plant will require uranium fuel enriched to 20%, four times higher than in conventional nuclear plants. The U.S. doesn't currently enrich fuel to that level for commercial power. For that matter, Levesque pointed out, about one-fifth of conventional nuclear fuel also is imported. So far, concerns in Wyoming about the project have been few. The Wyoming Outdoor Council, noting the declining cost of solar and wind power, points out that nuclear remains costly and sodium-cooled in other countries have had leaks leading to fires and shutdowns.  In between games of pool at Grumpies bar, Colt Quintard, a 30-year-old coal mine worker, said he isn’t as convinced as others the nuclear plant will be as big a boon to the community. He fears many of the plant's full-time workers will come from out of town due to the training needed and others will live in larger cities and commute. He’s open to getting training to work at the nuclear plant, but said more likely he’ll have go back to working around the county as a diesel mechanic, keeping him from being able to see his 2-year-old daughter each night. “I don’t think this community is going to benefit from it the way a lot people think it’s going to,” said Quintard. “Change is going to happen, regardless. There is nothing we can do.” Rocky Mountain Power employee Crystal Bowen has no such misgivings, saying the plant should allow her and others with Rocky Mountain Power to shift to jobs at the new plant. Bowen said her online research about the nuclear technology eased any concerns. “It was pretty shocking, back in 2019, when we heard that the fate of the plant wasn’t as long-lived as we thought,” said Bowen, who works in payroll and is a lifelong resident of the community. “I did not want to have to leave. I have children here. I have parents here and the idea of having to move to another location was pretty scary.” She added: “I don’t know if Kemmerer would have survived if we lost the power plant and the coal mine. It may have just turned into a ghost town.” TerraPower has pledged to train workers so anyone interested can transition to working at the nuclear plant when it opens, said Rodger Holt, manager of the Naughton coal plant. Kemmerer beat out three other Wyoming cities for the nuclear plant: nearby Rock Springs, Gillette in a coal-rich northeastern part of the state and Glenrock in east-central Wyoming. The Naughton plant employees, with experience on equipment such as generators that are used in both coal and nuclear plants, were a major reason for putting the plant in Kemmerer, according to TerraPower. The plant remains years off — 2028 is the current estimate — but already has triggered interest in real estate and “breathes new life into the town,” Mayor Bill Thek said. Gates’ reputation as a global supporter of developing and distributing vaccines — against COVID-19, malaria and other diseases that have killed millions worldwide — also have earned him skepticism in Wyoming, a deeply conservative state among the least vaccinated against the coronavirus. Gates, the famous co-founder Microsoft, started Bellevue, Washington-based TerraPower in 2008 and is chairman of its board. When asked about the billionaire, most in town held their tongues. Thek laughed when asked and said he didn’t want to “pick apart Bill Gates” and said “everyone knows who Bill Gates is,” while reminding that the U.S. government will pay for half of the project. “He’s put his money into this and that’s it, period,” Thek said. One thing Gates and Thek agree on: TerraPower’s planned Natrium plant could be key to cleaner energy not just for Kemmerer and Wyoming, but the world. “I’m not really on that bandwagon that everything is going to be green,” said Thek, who describes himself as a conservative. “But I’m absolutely for saving our environment. If we get in on the ground floor of being part of saving and making our environment better, I’m all for that.” ____ Gruver reported from Cheyenne.",U.S./Associated Press,"In tiny Wyoming town, Bill Gates bets big on nuclear power",https://news.yahoo.com/tiny-wyoming-town-bill-gates-051826365.html
1/18/2022,"In traditional aircraft or rockets, fuel is burned continuously in order to generate thrust. As speed increases, approaching the speed of sound, air in front of the craft compresses until it creates a shockwave which we hear on the ground as a sonic boom. More powerful jet engines are able to push through the shockwave gaining higher speeds, but there is a limit. At some point the disruption of the shockwave meets the thrust of the engine and you hit a wall. To go even faster, you need a better engine. Ramjets work by taking advantage of the shockwaves created at supersonic speeds. Specially built intakes at the front of the craft funnel the high pressure and compress it even further. The compressed air flows into a combustion chamber where it’s mixed with fuel and ejected out the back at supersonic speeds, creating additional thrust. Ramjets by definition can’t achieve thrust at subsonic speeds and instead need more traditional methods to get going. Once they’re up and moving, however, they’re highly efficient and capable of gaining speeds in excess of Mach 9 (7,000 miles per hour). That’s all well and good if you’re inside the Earth’s atmosphere and have plenty of air to play with, but scientists and engineers wondered if you could use a similar process to power spacecraft in order to achieve relativistic speeds. Ships in space can’t gather air from the vacuum but there are other materials which could be gathered and used for thrust. A paper published by Robert W. Bussard in 1960 proposed an interstellar ramjet later made famous by its use in Poul Anderson’s 1970 novel Tau Zero. Instead of gathering air to generate thrust, the Bussard ramjet would scoop up and compress ionized hydrogen from the near vacuum of space using electric or magnetic fields and use them for fuel. As the craft moves faster, the flow of protons into the engine would also increase, producing even more thrust. The whole process becomes almost self-sustaining, allowing such a craft to go spectacularly fast. Two years before Tau Zero, in 1968, John F. Fishback published a paper building on Bussard’s initial idea, proposing a magnetic scoop which might work to power an interstellar ramjet. While ramjets have made incredible progress within the confines of our atmosphere, relatively little attention has been paid to the development of similar space-based engines since Fishback’s paper, until now. A new paper by Peter Schattschneider from the Vienna University of Technology and Albert Jackson from Triton Systems, published in the journal Acta Astronautica takes a hard look at the work of Bussard and Fishback in hopes of finally determining if an interstellar ramjet engine could realistically be built. Their findings, sadly, suggest that while physics allows for their creation, they would require technology well beyond human capability. Because the distribution of ionized hydrogen in space is low — on the order of one atom per cubic centimeter — gathering enough to fuel a fusion reactor would require magnetic coils which the authors called “absurdly long.” Given realistic values, they estimated the coils would need a radius of approximately 2,000 kilometers. Moreover, as thrust increases, the strain on the magnetic coils needed to focus the protons into the reactor also increases until they reach a breaking point. Despite operating in a near vacuum, the result of the strain means that acceleration cannot continue beyond this point. Additionally, the upper limit of the engine’s acceleration is constrained by the chosen support material for the coils. Things become further complicated when we take into account the additional mass needed to support the magnetic coils as well as the mass of the coils themselves. Each bit of mass necessarily reduces the acceleration we’re able to gain. Ultimately, the new paper found that prior estimates for interstellar ramjets were far too optimistic, limiting the acceleration and possible ship time to three years at a distance of about 10 light years. That is, of course, an incredible improvement over current technologies but effectively erases the dream that such a craft could travel to the galactic center in a human lifetime. Not only is this technology beyond our current reach, Schattschneider and Jackson concluded that the engineering capability needed to construct a working interstellar ramjet exceeds even that of a Kardashev Level II civilization. Interstellar ramjets may very well be in our future, but it’s a very distant future at best.
