1/25/2022,"We are entering the business end of the Australian Political Open with the reigning champ “Slo-Mo” up against the league-loving lad whose identity he has appropriated, Albo. Scott Morrison is in trouble. Hampered by a clear lack of preparation, the master of the topspin has failed to deliver what was needed over summer with a series of ugly double-faults when all that was required was a basic service.  Meanwhile, his botched match-up with the world No 1 highlights his poor ongoing record in international competitions, reinforced by his tendency to prioritise showmanship over hard work and blame others for his own unforced errors. After starting this title defence strongly following a boilover victory in 2019 that left his opponents choking on the champagne they had prematurely popped, the champ dropped the second set after failing to show up on court just as the 2020 summer action was heating up. While stabilising in the third set by adapting a safety-first mindset and actively embracing his opponents’ baseline approach, he squandered this advantage incurring multiple infringements for delays. Now deep in the deciding set, Slo-Mo is attempting to absolve himself by arguing that balls flying off the rim to wreak havoc in the crowd have actually touched the line. But as this week’s Guardian Essential Report shows, the Australian voter’s hawk eye is not buying it, rating his recent form poorly and stripping him of his net positive rating for the first time since the Hawaiian Open debacle. A critical factor weighing the final outcome of this showdown will be the crowd. And what is particularly striking here is the degree to which the public has a personal stake in this contest. Over the past two decades the Political Open has become more a spectator sport, an emotional ride too often devoid of personal consequence as the crowd passively watched from the sidelines. In these contests players can get away with trick shots for the lols; convincing pensioners they were going to be taxed to death (Open Final 2019) or people in the suburbs that asylum seekers were clogging up their roads (Open Finals 2001, 2004, 2007, 2010 and 2013). But this summer the action has had greater meaning as people live the consequence of the Slo-Mo playbook: from the availability of rapid antigen tests to Covid vaccine booster supplies to supporting industries in lockdown, the public is experiencing what happens firsthand when a titleholder loses command of their game. In another question this week more than half of respondents indicated they had been personally affected by a summer of mistakes; young people, in particular, have been feeling the effects of the mishits. What was promised as a summer of freedom has actually been a summer of queues and fear and illness and frustrated plans, but most of all a summer of confusion. When the punters don’t have access to clear information, or worse, when they can’t do what they are meant to because the authorities have not provided them with the means to do it, then the game changes. When families are forced to manage the pandemic for themselves and their leader is doing nothing but playing the predictable strokes and pretending it’s all going to plan, then politics ceases to be a game at all. And when we are all told it is our “personal responsibility” to resolve this disconnect, we can end up shifting our allegiances to the other side. That’s what is happening right now. More than one-third of those watching say they are now less like to support Morrison and even allowing for those diehard Albo fans, this includes up to one in five Liberal voters who say they are less likely to stay in his corner. (Notably too, nearly a third of independent and small-party voters say his fracas would make him less likely to woo them back to the blue corner.) As any tennis player will tell you, once the momentum shifts it is really, really difficult to turn things around mid-rally. That’s where Morrison is in the final stage of this epic contest, bringing out the Hail Mary big shots, anything to land a winner that he can build on. We know he has a deep bag of tricks and he won’t leave a single one in the sack. Like a political Nick Kyrgios, he will bring the colour and bluster and curated photo-ops, but is he actually doing the work required to go the full distance? As for his opponent, the journeyman leftie has been conserving energy and making his opponent do all the running around. Maybe more Ash Barty, he was the only member of the last Cup-winning team to emerge with their dignity intact and is looking fitter as the match wears on. Provided he can hold his nerve and keep his radar honed, the onus is now on Albo to move up to the net. Game on!

1/25/2022,"Record fuel petrol prices and the highest cost of building new homes in two decades propelled consumer inflation at the end of 2021 to its fastest pace since mid-2014. Consumer price index figures released on Tuesday by the ABS showed the headline inflation rate for the December quarter was up 3.5% from a year earlier and 1.3% from the previous three months.  Economists though focused on the underlying rate – or trimmed mean – which strips out the more volatile price movements. That climbed by an annual rate of 2.6%, or the most since the June quarter of 2014, while the quarterly increase was at a 1% clip. “The big surprise was the 1.0% rise in the trimmed mean, well exceeding the market expectation of 0.7%, highlighting the broad spread of this inflation surprise,” Justin Smirk, a senior Westpac economist said, adding the quarterly pace was the fastest in just over 13 years. “Core inflation is now above the mid-point of the RBA’s inflation target, not something the RBA was expecting in its forecast profile this early nor of this magnitude.” Michelle Marquardt, head of ABS’s prices statistics unit, said the 4.2% jump in new dwelling costs and the jump of 6.6% in automotive fuel prices were leading contributors to the higher CPI. “Shortages of building supplies and labour, combined with continued strong demand for new dwellings, contributed to price increases for newly built houses, townhouses and apartments,” Marquardt said. The rises in the second half of 2021 were the fastest since the period prior to September 2000 when the GST began. “Fuel prices rose again in the December quarter, resulting in a record level for the CPI’s automotive fuel series for the second consecutive quarter,” she said. The lifting of some Covid restrictions and global supply disruptions worsened the bowser pain, with Hobart drivers enduring the largest increases, at 12.4%, followed by Darwin at 9.8% and Perth 9.4%, the ABS said. The CPI rose in all state capitals, led by Hobart’s 2.2% for the quarter. Melbourne and Sydney, at 1.1% and 1.2% respectively, were close to the national average of 1.3%. Consumer prices typically serve as a proxy for inflation. The trimmed mean measure, while sitting firmly in the mid-range of the RBA’s target of 2%-3%, has risen from a low of 1.1% in March last year. The increase to 2.6% – above market expectations - will probably prompt more banks to follow Westpac’s lead last week and bring forward their predictions of when the central bank will start lifting the official cash rate. “While some of these cost pressures could still be seen as transitory, we expect the RBA will strike a more hawkish tone at next week’s meeting [on 1 February],” said Sean Langcake, a senior economist at BIS Oxford Economics. “A rate rise in 2022 is now more likely in light of these data.” The RBA has said it would be patient before lifting rates above the current record low 0.1%, with the first move unlikely before 2023. Westpac expects a move this August. Uncertainty in global sharemarkets, stoked in part by rising risks of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, would be one reason for rates caution. Another is that the central bank will want to understand the economic effects of the rapid spread of Omicron that came too late to pick up much in the CPI data. Fresh figures out from NAB at the same time as today’s CPI release showed business confidence fell sharply in December as Omicron threatened to stall the economic rebound from last year’s east-coast lockdowns. Confidence last month sank below the level reached during Delta, “signalling the depth of concern among firms about the trajectory of the outbreak,” NAB said. Business conditions also fell three points to eight index points, in part because firms struggled to find staff. Profitability though was up one point to be 10 index points, and trading conditions were unchanged at 14 index points. “Conditions eased but remained just above the long-run average in December,” said NAB chief economist, Alan Oster. “Conditions improved in a number of states including Victoria and Tasmania, but there was a large fall in Queensland that may relate to some of the challenges with state borders.” NAB’s survey also picked up rising price pressures last month, with both reported labour and purchase cost growth near record levels. “With significant disruption to supply chains and labour markets, price pressures are to be expected and the key question will be how quickly (if at all) these pressures abate over coming months,” NAB said. Two other measures released on Tuesday offered a more upbeat take on the economy. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia’s weekly credit card spending tracker revealed a broad rebound had begun, at least in the figures to 21 January. Consumer spending is “holding up better than feared”, the report said, while adding the necessary caveat that it’s “still early days” in terms of living with Covid. Western Australia, which notably has put off its reopening date to the never-never, was leading all states in the spending rebound. The ANZ-Roy Morgan Australian Consumer Confidence Survey also showed the mood to be picking up. Consumer sentiment improved 2.2% last week to be just above the neutral 100 mark in the index. Again, WA helped to lead the improvement, along with Victoria and Queensland, while New South Wales slumped, as did South Australia. Measures such as whether it’s time to buy a major household item rose 6.3 percentage points, reversing some of the 15.8% fall during the first two weeks of 2022. Inflation expectations, meanwhile, edged up in the ANZ survey to match a recent high of 5%.",News/Business,Record fuel prices and cost of new homes push inflation to fastest pace since mid-2014,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/25/record-fuel-prices-and-cost-of-new-homes-pushes-inflation-to-fastest-pace-since-mid-2014
1/25/2022,"Campaigners are calling for the Tour Down Under to follow the example of Tennis Australia and abandon its sponsorship deal with Santos as the oil company’s boss says those looking for a faster transition to renewable energy are “dreaming”. Santos CEO Kevin Gallagher has defended the oil and gas company in the face of increasing pressure over its efforts to open up new gas fields, telling the Sydney Morning Herald there is currently “no alternative” to fossil fuels.  “Unless you can replace us tomorrow with some new green fuel that we don’t know what it is today, then the focus should be on developing energy that’s affordable and cleaning it up by reducing emissions until alternatives are viable and affordable,” Gallagher said. He said fossil fuel companies were the only organisations with experience managing “mega-projects spending trillions of dollars globally every single year” and any transition to a zero carbon economy was not possible without them. “If someone thinks some new set of project builders is just going to arrive from somewhere else with trillions of dollars to start building some new energy infrastructure globally ... they are dreaming,” he said. Gallagher’s comments come as sporting events like the Tour Down Under festival of cycling, which began on Monday and is sponsored by Santos, face increasing pressure to divest from fossil fuel sponsorships owing to their contribution to climate change. Belinda Noble, founder of Comms Declare which monitors the work public relations firms do for fossil fuel companies, said Santos’ sponsorship of sports at all levels was a way to gain “clout and political influence”. “They’re not doing this for altruistic reasons – it’s hard-headed business to create social licence for their polluting products,” Noble said. “Sports allows them deep engagement with the communities they operate in. The Tour Down Under is a good example, as there are so many prongs of their marketing campaign. “It’s deep in the community with events and local activation. It really helps them peddle the myths that gas is required to make Australia work.” As the Tour Down Under and Festival of Cycling are owned by the South Australian Tourism Commission and managed by Events South Australia, Noble said the close association of the state government meant comments like those from Gallagher raised a significant “reputational risk”. “Gallagher’s job is to promote gas. He’s very good at that. But whatever he thinks is irrelevant,” Noble said. “As South Australia has recently shown, we can run on 100% renewables now,” she said. Renewable energy met all of South Australia’s demand for power for almost a full week between 23 December and 29 December last year. Santos’ sponsorship of the Tour Down Under has faced sustained opposition over the past two years, including a petition that has so far attracted 5,000 signatures. Professional cyclists including Grace Brown, Cyrus Monk, Jack Marshall, Kirsty Deacon and Stuart Alexander have also signed a statement calling for an end to the deal. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Fossil Free SA’s Paul Boundy said the ongoing arrangement was “ironic” given the Tour Down Under route ran through areas bushfire affected areas in 2020 and the event 2019 had some routes shortened due to extreme heat. “Sports were once sponsored by cigarettes and we got rid of cigarettes,” Boundy said. “Sports can function at a professional level without greenwashing the most damaging companies.” Boundy said his group wanted the South Australian Tourism Commission to follow the example of Tennis Australia and end the relationship with Santos in favour of an alternative sponsor when the contract comes up for renewal in 2023. “Fossil fuels aren’t the only option,” Boundy said. Extinction Rebellion in South Australia has separately announced plans to protest the sponsorship by blocking the Tour Down Under route during the race. Few details are known about the terms of the arrangement with Santos but a sponsorship agreement giving the oil company naming rights was signed in 2019, extending a decade-long partnership.

Last year the International Energy Agency said limiting global heating to 1.5C, a goal set out in the Paris agreement, meant exploration and exploitation of new fossil fuel basins had to stop in 2021.",News/Business,‘Helps peddle myths’: Australia’s Tour Down Under facing pressure to dump Santos as sponsor,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/25/helps-peddle-myths-australias-tour-down-under-facing-pressure-to-dump-santos-as-sponsor
