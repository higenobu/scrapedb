5/8/2022,"Some of Britain’s betting giants are revealed to have quietly lobbied Treasury officials against a proposed industry crackdown, claiming it will cost millions of pounds in lost tax receipts. Executives representing Bet365, Paddy Power and Ladbrokes met officials from the Treasury and Revenue and Customs, warning a radical overhaul of the industry could drive gamblers to the black market. The meeting was with tax officials rather than ministers and was therefore not required to be automatically disclosed. The betting industry claims there is a “very real risk” that the taxes of about £3.2bn a year it hands to the Treasury could be hit by tougher rules for the sector. A government white paper on gambling reforms is due to be published shortly. Matt Zarb-Cousin, director of campaign group Clean Up Gambling, said: “The industry is trying to water down the proposed reforms in the gambling review by lobbying tax officials under the radar. This is massive propaganda from an industry that has engaged in tax avoidance for years. I hope the Treasury isn’t buying it. There needs to be full transparency over this lobbying campaign.” The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport announced a review of the gambling laws in December 2020 amid concerns that too many people are suffering significant harm. An NHS survey in 2018 showed there were about 245,000 problem gamblers in England. A Public Health England study last year estimated there are 409 suicides a year associated with problem gambling. Campaigners want a new levy on the industry to fund research and treatment for problem gamblers. They also want to see stricter checks on what gamblers can afford to pay, new stake limits on online slot games, a ban on gambling advertising in sport and a ban on VIP schemes. Documents released under freedom of information laws reveal that executives from Bet365, Flutter, which operates the Paddy Power and Betfair brands, and Entain, which operates the Ladbrokes, Coral and PartyCasino brands, held an online meeting with the Treasury and Revenue and Custom tax specialists on 7 October last year and warned against what they feared may be excessive proposed regulations in the review. The betting firms submitted a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers, commissioned by the industry, which found an increase in unlicensed online gambling in the UK. The betting firms warned the black market could be fuelled by a wide-ranging overhaul of gambling laws. A two-page document presented to officials warned: “It is vital that the government takes a holistic view of tax and regulatory changes over the coming months or there is the very real risk that the UK’s remote gambling sector is hit in a way that not only reduces its economic and fiscal contribution, but also increases levels of gambling-related harm by incentivising a shift to unlicensed gambling operators that pay no UK tax.” It added that executives would be keen to engage in further dialogue with tax officials to discuss developments “as DCMS prepares its white paper for publication”. The betting industry opposes proposals for a statutory levy and what it claims would be overzealous checks on what customers can afford to bet. The details of the lobbying by the industry have angered relatives of those who have lost their lives while in the grip of gambling addiction. The charity Gambling with Lives, a community of families bereaved by gambling-related suicides, has spearheaded the campaign for reform. Judith Bruney, 62, from Sheffield, whose 25-year-old son Chris killed himself in April 2017 after he gambled £119,395 in five days without spending checks, said: “The industry wants to get away with the minimum change that they can. Surely they must know what damage it causes.” Charles Ritchie, co-founder with his wife Liz of Gambling with Lives, said there needed to be a package of new reforms, including redesigning the most addictive games, and tougher sanctions against the industry when it failed to implement player safeguards. He said: “You have a highly profitable industry and the fines can be viewed as a cost of business. There needs to be a more effective punishment regime.” Matt Gaskell, clinical lead of the NHS Northern Gambling Service, supports a statutory levy for the industry to fund research and treatment. He said: “Many of the operators haven’t fulfilled their obligations under the voluntary system. A statutory levy would ensure a system of stable and sustained funding.” The Betting and Gaming Council, which represents the gambling industry, says it supports the gambling review, but that it also needs to strike the right balance between protecting vulnerable people and not “spoiling the enjoyment” of those who bet safely. It says the industry is taking a package of measures to protect gamblers who may be at risk of harm, and that Gambling Commission figures show the number of problem gamblers is falling. Betting firms have faced criticism over the years for basing their operations overseas – including in Gibraltar and Malta – which can reduce their tax bills. Bet365 has its headquarters in Britain and says it is one of the country’s biggest taxpayers. A spokesperson said: “It is absolutely normal and appropriate for the government generally to engage with us and others in our industry in the context of its ongoing review of the Gambling Act, as would be the case across all sectors undergoing potentially significant regulatory changes.” An Entain spokesperson said: “Entain is proud to be among the top 20 corporate taxpayers to the UK Treasury. As such, and in common with thousands of other UK companies, we are of course in regular contact with HMT and HMRC officials.” A Flutter spokesperson said: “Flutter paid £1.6bn in tax globally last year, including more than £600m in the UK where we are one of the largest corporate taxpayers. We engage with a range of stakeholders, including HMT, and we are proud of the significant contribution we make to the UK economy.” Treasury officials said they regularly meet stakeholders from across industry to hear their views.",News/Society,Revealed: betting giants lobbied UK government over proposed crackdown,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/07/revealed-betting-giants-lobbied-uk-government-over-proposed-crackdown
5/8/2022,"When a Conservative-supporting thinktank tried to analyse the forthcoming 2019 general election, it dreamed up an archetypal swing voter who it said would be key to a Tory victory. Winning over the “Workington Man” – a leave-voting, rugby league-loving, white, working-class, jaded Labour supporter aged over 45 – would be crucial, it said. The stereotype was received by many in the former mining town in Cumbria as crude and insulting. But the underlying premise – that long-time Labour voters were inching towards the Tories – carried some truth. In the 2019 election, the “red wall” of Labour heartlands crumbled as voters turned their backs on Jeremy Corbyn. In Workington, the Tory Mark Jenkinson was elected MP. Last week, however, there were signs that the tide could be turning. In the local elections, Labour won a large majority, taking 30 out of 46 seats on the new Cumberland council, which will cover Copeland, Carlisle and Allerdale (including Workington), compared with the Tories’ seven. In a triumphant 5.30am Facebook post, local Labour councillors announced the news. “The Workington Man has voted Labour,” they said. For Bronwen Stringer, 45, Workington Man is an idea dreamed up by the London elite. “I don’t know where they got it from,” she says. “They don’t give a monkey’s chuff about us.” But, she says, she shares some of the traits associated with the fictional swing voter. “I’m a Workington woman. I’m one of the ones that’s on the fence.” A market-stall holder with three children, Stringer has previously voted Labour and supports the party’s local politicians, but backed Boris Johnson in the 2019 election because she “didn’t like Corbyn as a person”. She’s yet to make her mind up about how she’ll vote in the general election, but is edging back towards Labour. “I quite like the leader they’ve got now. Is it Keir Starmer?” she says. “He seems a bit more transparent than the Borises of the world. Don’t get me wrong, I like Boris as a person and I could imagine having a good crack with him. It’s just this Partygate thing… My kids’ grandma passed away on her own. That’s what sticks with me.” A former motorbike shop owner, Rob Fisher, 61, also voted for Johnson in 2019 because he supported Brexit and thought Tory policies “suited our needs” as business owners. Since then, his support has waned. He didn’t turn out for the local elections and isn’t sure he’ll vote next time, either. “I’ve always voted but this time I just thought, ‘No’,” he said. “They’re all a load of lying idiots. Everything they’ve said they were going to do they haven’t done, and everything they said they wouldn’t do, they did.” Another Workington resident also voted for Johnson in 2019. “I’ve always been Labour but I did vote Conservative at the last general election. I thought Boris would be a better leader,” the retired electrician, 86, said. Last week, he voted for Labour after a B-road by his house was turned into an A-road, increasing traffic noise. “Labour are the only ones who mentioned it,” he said. But while he knows he wouldn’t vote for Johnson again, his support for Labour doesn’t extend to the national leadership. “Boris won’t get my vote. I couldn’t trust him now with anything. But I don’t think I’d vote for Labour either,” he said. Labour’s Andy Semple, who won a seat on Cumberland council, puts his victory down to old-fashioned campaigning, rather than the party’s national leadership. “It’s boots on the ground and leaflets through the door. It’s not rocket science,” he said. Brexit, he said, was “the only big reason that Workington went Conservative” in 2019. But this time around, “it just wasn’t mentioned”, with doorstep conversations instead dominated by concerns about food, fuel and the costs of living. The relative invisibility of the national leader also helped. While Corbyn turned voters off, Starmer hardly came up. “I’m a Keir Starmer fan; I voted for him. But to me, a national leader in the local elections should be the silent leader, a quiet leader. If he’s dominating the agenda they’re not voting for you as the local candidate,” he said. His win in the former Tory stronghold of Cockermouth South – which he likens to a “Workington Wandsworth” – suggests Labour’s result was not just down to old supporters returning to their roots, but also long-time Tory voters switching allegiance. “It’s the start of a new dawn,” he said. “We’re starting to win people’s trust.” Elizabeth Mallinson, a Tory councillor who lost the Stanwix Urban seat in Cumberland to the Lib Dem candidate, with 559 votes to 1,472, wishes she had the benefit of a silent leader. She blames her loss on Johnson. “People were absolutely livid. The answer on the doorstep for me was, ‘It’s toxic in London. We’ve got rules and regulations and we’ve all obeyed them and they should obey them’,” she said. “I’m rather cross that London has pulled the rug from under local politicians.” While the results were “really disappointing” for the Tories, she doesn’t believe that nationally, Labour has it in the bag. “This is a wake-up call for the government, and also for the Labour party. They’re not all sitting in a bed of roses because we’ve got Greens and Liberal Democrats.” The Lib Dems took four seats on the new Cumberland council, the Greens two and independents three. But in Westmorland and Furness, the neighbouring Cumbria council, the Lib Dems won 36 of the 65 seats to seize overall control. Will Tanner, director of Onward – the right-leaning thinktank that invented “Workington Man” – said it was too early to judge the significance of Labour’s local election success. He described the results as “underwhelming at best” for the Conservatives. But he said he suspected Labour’s success in Cumberland was down to local issues – “everything from bin collections to antisocial behaviour”, rather than national factors. “You do see the broad continuation of the trend that Workington Man was the archetype for,” he said. “But Workington itself seems to have been slightly anomalous.” “If you look at other results around the country, you’ll see the effect that Workington Man represented – ie the shift of northern and Midlands voters towards the Conservatives – continuing in other ways. Workington Man was not just about Workington. It was also about Newcastle-under-Lyme, it was also about Walsall, Nuneaton, Wakefield and Wigan.”",News/Politics,Workington Man turned Tory in 2019 but slipped back to Labour in UK local elections,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/07/workington-man-turned-tory-in-2019-but-slipped-back-to-labour-in-uk-local-elections
5/8/2022,"Ministers are facing calls to immediately halt a plan to begin shifting millions of people on to universal credit, amid serious concerns that it risks “pushing many of them into destitution”. Some of the country’s most prominent charities have made a joint plea to the government to halt the migration of claimants from the old benefits system to the new system, warning that vulnerable people will be given a three-month deadline to make a new claim or risk losing their current benefits. In an open letter to work and pensions secretary Thérèse Coffey, seen by the Observer, charities including Mind, The Trussell Trust, Shelter and Disability Rights UK state that as many as 2.6 million people could eventually be affected. The figure includes 700,000 people with mental health problems, learning disabilities and dementia. They say that anyone unable to engage with the plan risks being left with no income at all. The process of “managed migration” to universal credit is due to start from Monday. It will see people move off old income-related benefits, jobseeker’s allowance and tax credits. While a few hundred will be moved now, everyone is due to be moved to the new system in the next two years. “We are … gravely concerned about the Department for Work and Pensions’ (DWP) plans for universal credit managed migration,” the group writes. “We believe that your approach for moving people receiving older benefits on to universal credit risks pushing many of them into destitution. “We ask you to consider the devastating consequences for someone who faces challenges in engaging with the process having their only income cut off, especially during this cost-of-living crisis. No one subject to managed migration should have their existing benefit stopped until they have established a claim to universal credit. Instead of setting arbitrary deadlines, the DWP needs to take responsibility for ensuring people’s safety.” They call for “proactive support” from the government for those being forced to move. “We urge you to refocus on supporting people by creating and communicating a clear safeguarding process,” they write. “We ask you to pause your approach until you have addressed these risks, and commit to completing a thorough trial of the process and putting the outcomes to parliament for scrutiny.” Charities are concerned by the government’s own 2018 research, which showed that among people with longterm health conditions, 24% could not register a claim online, only 57% were confident about managing their payments and 53% said they needed more support setting up their claim. More than a third (38%) said they needed more ongoing support. The DWP will initially move 500 people across to universal credit. However, Mind warned it was unacceptable to use those in the group as “guinea pigs” – and that being left without help could be life-threatening. “The DWP’s managed migration plans could leave people with mental health problems with no income,” said Paul Farmer, Mind’s chief executive. “Those too unwell to engage with the DWP could be left unable to pay their rent, buy food, or pay their rising energy bills. This is completely unacceptable. “Mind – and many other charities representing people affected by health problems and poverty – is willing and able to help shape the managed migration process into one which is fit for purpose and which does not risk the financial security of hundreds of thousands of people. But as things stand, the managed migration process is too dangerous to continue.” Sara Ogilvie, director of policy at the Child Poverty Action Group, said that proceeding with the migration process without a full trial and evaluation was “profoundly irresponsible”. “It should not be asking claimants – who by definition are least able to bear financial pressures – to shoulder the risk, in particular at a time when budgets are already stretched to breaking point,” she said. “The department must commit to fully trialling and publicly reporting on the managed migration process and it must ensure that no one loses their existing benefits until they have a new claim for universal credit securely established.” A DWP spokesperson said: “Over five million people are already supported by universal credit. It is a dynamic system which adjusts as people’s earnings change, is more generous overall than the old benefits, and simplifies our safety net for those who cannot work. “Roughly 1.4 million people on legacy benefits would be better off on universal credit, with top-up payments available for eligible claimants whose universal credit entitlement is less.”",News/Society,"Halt shift to universal credit to protect vulnerable Britons, charities demand",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/07/halt-shift-to-universal-credit-to-protect-vulnerable-britons-charities-demand
5/8/2022,"In the most demanding and unforgiving Premier League title race it is Liverpool who have blinked first. Jürgen Klopp’s team sit at the summit once again but, having seen their 12-game winning league run at Anfield come to an end against a resolute Tottenham, a point will be considered insufficient in the bid to dethrone Manchester City. Klopp rallied the Kop after the final whistle - never give up, the message - but Trent Alexander-Arnold’s reaction was telling. The Liverpool defender dropped to his knees after an enthralling game in which Son Heung-min put Antonio Conte’s side in sight of a precious victory in their pursuit of Champions League qualification before Luis Díaz’s deflected strike rescued a point for the hosts. City can open up a three-point gap should they pick themselves up off the floor to defeat Newcastle at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday. On paper, Spurs’ visit to Anfield appeared the most awkward assignment left for Liverpool in their pursuit of the Premier League title. It played out as such on the pitch. Klopp’s team started with an intensity and confidence that was also evident in the crowd following another momentous week for the club. Andy Robertson, snapping in to dispossess Rodrigo Bentancur and set up a half chance for Sadio Mané inside the opening minute, typified the ferocity with which the Champions League finalists worked to regain possession. But Conte’s team weathered the initial storm and, as the Liverpool manager had predicted, the danger posed by “some of the best counter attacking players in the world” soon became apparent. From Spurs’ first attack in the sixth minute Harry Kane’s cross forced Alisson to save at the feet of Son and from Bentancur’s follow-up, although the South Korea international was offside. A warning nevertheless. The visitors’ broke again moments later when Dejan Kulusevski released Pierre-Emile Højbjerg in far too much space for Klopp’s liking down the right. Kane received the midfielder’s cross but, having seemingly escaped Jordan Henderson inside the area, his goal-bound shot was blocked by a perfectly-timed challenge from the Liverpool captain. The threat from Spurs was sporadic, however, and with Díaz all movement and menace on the left for Liverpool, Thiago Alcãntara finding space in a crowded midfield and Mohamed Salah linking well with Mané, the visitors spent much of the first half encamped deep inside their half. Hugo Lloris clawed the ball away from the lurking Salah, making his 250th appearance for Liverpool, when Ryan Sessegnon headed a Thiago cross over his own six-yard box under pressure from Henderson. Cristian Romero almost gifted the hosts a chance with a careless clearance straight at Mané but recovered to pinch the ball off Salah’s toes and Virgil van Dijk, towering over Ben Davies, headed an Alexander-Arnold corner against the crossbar. Lloris intervened again when Díaz combined with Mané before aiming for the bottom corner from 20 yards. The visitors countered immediately through Son, who found Højbjerg arriving in space 25 yards from goal. His low drive beat Alisson only to strike the base of the goalkeeper’s right hand post and cannon away to safety. It was an absorbing game featuring moments of individual excellence and unforced errors from both teams. Liverpool found themselves in several promising situations early in the second half but, too often, their final ball was lacking. Lloris put his side in trouble by throwing straight to Salah and was indebted to Davies for preventing a Henderson cut-back finding the Egypt international in front of goal. The Spurs’ goalkeeper would start the move that produced the long-awaited and much-needed breakthrough. Lloris picked out Emerson Royal with an accurate clearance that the defender lofted on to Kane. The England captain controlled superbly and easily drifted past a static Alexander-Arnold and Liverpool’s back-line was suddenly exposed. Kane could have shot but saw the bigger picture and released Sessegnon sprinting into space down the left. The wing-back crossed first time and there was Son, unmarked and six yards out, to score the first league goal against Liverpool since Gabriel Jesus for City on 10 April. With the title on the line Klopp introduced Diogo Jota for Henderson plus Kostas Tsimikas for the tiring Robertson. The visitors met Liverpool’s desperate search for a way back with impressive resistance. Romero, Eric Dier and Davies formed a formidable barrier, with the Wales international producing a superb block to thwart Salah after the forward had cut inside the Spurs’ area and lined up an equaliser. It arrived a minute later to a deafening roar and thanks to a dollop of good fortune for Liverpool. Díaz, who helped transform the Champions League semi-final at Villarreal on Tuesday, was the man of the moment once again. Collecting Thiago’s pass on the left, the Colombia international cut across two Spurs players and let fly from 22 yards out. Lloris may have had the shot covered but a deflection off Bentancur left him flat-footed and Anfield in uproar as Diaz’s effort sailed into the bottom corner. Klopp beat his chest on the touchline. The comeback that Liverpool craved was in sight but it was not to be. Spurs could and should have won it in stoppage time but Højbjerg attempted to head back to Kane with the goal at his mercy and Ibrahima Konaté intervened.",Sport/Football,Tottenham’s resistance puts major dent in Liverpool’s title hopes,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/07/liverpool-tottenham-premier-league-match-report
