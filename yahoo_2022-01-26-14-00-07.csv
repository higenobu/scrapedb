1/26/2022,"BANGKOK (AP) — A monkey with ghostly white circles around its eyes is among 224 new species listed in the World Wildlife Fund’s latest update on the greater Mekong region. The conservation group’s report, released Wednesday, highlights the need to protect the rich biodiversity and habitats in the region, which includes Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Myanmar. The species listed were found in 2020 but last year’s report was delayed. The monkey, a new species of Popa langur found on the extinct Mt. Popa volcano in Myanmar, was the only new mammal. There are also dozens of newly identified reptiles, frogs and newts, fish and 155 plant species, including the only known succulent bamboo species, found in Laos. The Mekong region is a biodiversity hotspot and home to tigers, Asian elephants, saola — an extremely rare animal also called the Asian unicorn or spindlehorn — and thousands of other species. Including this latest list, scientists have identified more than 3,000 new species in the region since 1997, the WWF said. Scientists used measurements and samples from museum collections to compare and identify key differences with features of the newly discovered animals and plants, the report said. Studying such differences can help determine the range of species and threats to their survival, Thomas Ziegler, a curator at the University of Cologne's Institute of Zoology, said in introducing the report. Identifying new species is tricky, though, and sometimes can only be determined using a variety of methods, such as frog calls and genetic data used to distinguish the Cardamom leaf little frog, found high up in the Cardamom mountains in a wildlife refuge. Some species are found in more than one country, including the bright orange twin slug snake, which consumes slugs. The new monkey species, Popa langur, was found based on genetic matching of recently gathered bones with specimens from Britain's Natural History Museum collected more than a century ago, the report said. Two main distinguishing characteristics were the broad white rings around its eyes and its front-pointing whiskers. The WWF, working with Fauna and Flora International, caught images of the monkeys using camera traps in 2018. FFI reported the discovery late last year. The monkey is a candidate to be listed as a critically endangered species on the Red List of the IUCN, the report said, since only 200-250 are thought to survive in the wild, in a handful of places. A new type of begonia with reddish flowers and a berry-like fruit also was found in the uplands of Myanmar, where illegal mining and logging have become an increasingly dire threat in the country, which is in the midst of political turmoil following a military takeover a year ago. Despite human encroachments on tropical forests and other wild zones, much of the Greater Mekong is still little explored and each year dozens of new species are found — a glimmer of hope as so many species go extinct. Not all new species are found deep in jungles. One of the new plant species is a ginger plant called “stink bug"" for its pungent odor similar to big beetles Thais use to make a kind of chili dipping paste served with rice, the report said. It was found in northeastern Thailand, in a plant shop.",Science/Associated Press,Report: Ghostly monkey among 224 new Mekong region species,https://news.yahoo.com/report-ghostly-monkey-among-224-000742969.html
1/26/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- The chances are rising a powerful storm will sweep the Northeast of the U.S. late Friday into Saturday, bringing heavy snow, rain and winds and potentially disrupting air, rail and road transportation as far south as New York and New Jersey.

It will then build itself into a nor’easter Friday afternoon off the East Coast and intensify so rapidly it could become a so-called bomb cyclone. “It is definitely a concern for us,” said Alyson Hoegg, a senior meteorologist with AccuWeather Inc. in State College, Pennsylvania. “When it forms off the southeast coast, it is going to rapidly strengthen.” The Northeast has lagged below normal for snowfall this year, so the storm has the potential to be the biggest in the region this season. Since Dec. 1, Central Park has received 7 inches (18 centimeters) of snow, or 4.2 inches below normal. Boston, Philadelphia and Washington are all running behind average as well. A storm undergoes a rapid shift known as bombogenesis if its central pressure drops by 24 millibars in 24 hours. Meteorologists often refer to this process as a storm “bombing out.” While computer forecast models are calling for heavy snow across New England, there is a chance it could also pile up from Washington to New York and along the Interstate 95 corridor, said Rich Bann, a forecaster with the U.S. Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. Meteorologists will have a clearer idea in the next day or so because the energy coming off the Pacific will be sampled by weather balloons and other observations, Bann said. This increases the accuracy of the forecast as the system moves east. Confidence is growing New England will receive heavy snow and high winds, but there is a chance that rain could wrap in along the coast keeping totals down, Bann said. There is less confidence for the forecast from New York south. “There is a whole lot of uncertainty,” Bann said. “It will depend on where it develops and when it develops.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek The Tragicomedy of Boris Johnson Enters Its Final Act The Charismatic Developer and the Ponzi Scheme That Suckered San Diego Venture Investors’ $1.4 Billion Bet on News Faces a Reality Check How Did ID.me Get Between You and Your Identity?
