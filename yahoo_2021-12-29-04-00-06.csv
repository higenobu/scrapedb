12/29/2021,"Jason Davis Well, this Twitter feud was certainly unexpected! On Dec. 23, infamous conservative pundit Candace Owens went toe to toe with The View’s Meghan McCain on Twitter. The two right-leaning TV hosts sparred over the social media platform about the vaccine and Owens’ recent viral interview with former President Donald Trump. Now, if you haven’t watched the interview, the controversial one term Prez set the record straight about his stance on vaccines telling the former Fox News correspondent, who, as we all know is staunchly against the jab, that the life-saving drug was one of the biggest achievements of his administration. “I came up with three vaccines, all are very very good, in less than nine months. It was supposed to be five to 12 years,” he said. Owens countered Trump, asking the former White House leader if there were any conspiracies behind the efficacy of the vaccine. She alleged that more people fell sick this year under Biden’s administration compared to when he was in office, but Trump swiftly denied the accusation. “The ones that get very sick, and go to the hospital, are the ones that don’t take the vaccine, but it is still their choice. And if you take the vaccine you’re protected, he explained. Look the results of the vaccine are very good. And if you do get it, it’s a very minor form. People aren’t dying when they take the vaccine.” RELATED CONTENT: The CDC Recommends Shorter Isolation Period For COVID-19 The daughter of the late Republican politician John McCain took to Twitter to applaud Trump for “schooling” Candace about the vaccine’s effectiveness. “Trump schooling Candace Owens with facts and logic regarding getting the vaccine is really a sight to behold. Credit where credit is due and I hate the guy,” she tweeted. Of course, Owens had a few words for Meghan. “Hey Meghan— did you know that the overwhelming majority of people dying and/or being hospitalized from Covid-19 are clinically obese?” the podcast host clapped back while fat-shaming McCain. “People like you love the vaccine because it allows you to pretend that you care about health. People like me see right through that bullsh*t.” Hey Meghan— did you know that the overwhelming majority of people dying and/or being hospitalized from Covid-19 are clinically obese?People like you love the vaccine because it allows you to pretend that you care about health.People like me see right through that bullshit. https://t.co/fbtt2OVCJj — Candace Owens (@RealCandaceO) December 24, 2021 The ladies went back and forth until McCain hit the 32-year-old pro-Trump activist with a one-piece combo. “Get fucked,” she barked back at Owens‘ insensitive obesity comment. Coming from the woman who did an entire IG Live tonight talking at LENGTH about how obese I am as opposed to addressing the fact that her hero fact-checked her. You spread misinformation about the safety of vaccines. You're a danger to public health. Get fucked. https://t.co/GDwX9JgdOK — Meghan McCain (@MeghanMcCain) December 24, 2021 Well, we certainly didn’t see that one coming! It’s important to remember while a number of breakthrough cases have occurred in people who are fully vaccinated and boosted, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that all three doses can prevent people from being hospitalized or potentially dying from COVID-19. Moderna announced last week that their booster shot, in particular, drastically raised the level of antibodies needed to fight off the highly transmissible Omicron variant along with other strains. As MADAMENOIRE previously reported, the drug company found that its standard dose of 50-micrograms of the booster increased antibody levels roughly 37-fold. A full dose of 100-micrograms was found to be even more powerful, with antibody levels jumping to around 83-fold compared to “pre-boost levels”. Earlier this month, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that their vaccine also showed a strong impact in preventing hospitalization from COVID-19. The company said that recipients who received a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine increased their antibody levels 25-fold, according to their website.

12/29/2021,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention significantly revised its model of the breakdown of Covid-19 variants on Tuesday, estimating the Omicron strain accounted for about 58.6 percent of U.S. cases as of Dec. 25. The public health agency’s previous estimate that the rapidly spreading variant accounted for 73.2 percent of cases nationwide on Dec. 18 is now revised down to 22.5 percent — a significant drop that falls outside the agency's earlier 95 percent prediction interval, or likely range where future analysis will fall, of 34 to 94.9 percent of all cases. The agency said the disparity was due to the rate with which the highly transmissible Omicron spread. “There was a wide predictive interval posted in last week’s chart, in part because of the speed at which Omicron was increasing,” CDC spokesperson Jasmine Reed told POLITICO. “We had more data come in from that timeframe and there was a reduced proportion of Omicron.” The White House didn't immediately respond to request for comment. The CDC’s revised Dec. 25 model includes a narrower confidence range of Omicron's prevalence: 41.5 to 74 percent. The agency’s current model suggests that the Delta variant still represents 41.1 percent of U.S. infections. CDC updates the model weekly. “Setting aside the question of how the initial estimate was so inaccurate, if CDC’s new estimate of Omicron prevalence is precise then it suggests that a good portion of the current hospitalizations we’re seeing from Covid may still be driven by Delta infections,” former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb tweeted Tuesday. The U.S. is now recording more than 206,000 daily Covid-19 infections — a number that is rapidly growing. Americans continue to travel at high levels through the holidays: more than 2 million people flew yesterday, according to Transportation Security Administration data. “It’s important to note that we’re still seeing steady increase in the proportion of Omicron,” Reed said.",Health/Politico,CDC sharply drops estimate of Omicron prevalence in U.S.,https://news.yahoo.com/cdc-sharply-drops-estimate-omicron-174834846.html
12/29/2021,"After a months-long dispute over a security light came to a head, two neighbors in a Lake County community have died in a murder-suicide, deputies say. The men, Eric Hilderbrandt, 61, and Timothy Patch, 59, lived next door to one another on Fishermans Road in Paisley, about three miles northeast of Umatilla. The men had been arguing since October over a floodlight Patch installed. Hilderbrandt complained that it was too bright and was shining into his bedroom at night, according to Lt. Fred Jones with the Lake County Sheriff’s Office. Deputies were called to the area about 12:30 p.m. Monday after a confrontation between the two neighbors ended in gunfire. Investigators say Hilderbrandt shot and killed Patch in his driveway then went home and shot himself. Hilderbrandt “was found sitting in a chair deceased from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound,” Jones said. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline takes calls 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

12/29/2021,"The secrets of the only royal mummy from ancient Egypt never to be unwrapped have been revealed, thanks to the use of CT scanning technology. The preserved body of Amenhotep I, who is thought to have reigned from 1525–1504 BC, has, since its discovery in 1881, never had its burial swaddle removed, in part to preserve a remarkably intact burial mask. Using a CT (computed tomography) scanner normally associated with medical treatment, researchers were able to produce a detailed 3D model, including layered “slices”, of the mummy. ""By digitally unwrapping the mummy and 'peeling off' its virtual layers - the facemask, the bandages, and the mummy itself – we could study this well-preserved pharaoh in unprecedented detail,” said Dr Sahar Saleem, first author of the study and a radiologist at both Cairo University and the Egyptian Mummy Project. Until now, the inability to unwrap the body had prevented Egyptologists from explaining a number of mysteries about Amenhotep I. The most prominent was the question of why he was found not in his own tomb but that of a pharaoh 400 to 500 years younger and having been twice rewrapped. Amenhotep I had undergone X-ray studies at least twice before, once in 1932 and a second time in 1962. However, the 2D images proved difficult to interpret. The first X-ray study deemed the 18th dynasty pharaoh to have died aged 40 to 50, but the second argued that he was just 25. That lack of clarity also left archaeologists debating why exactly the mummy had been moved. One suggestion was that it was so that funerary tributes, such as jewellery and amulets, could be removed and reused. But, according to the authors of the new CT study, published in the journal Frontiers in Medicine, that theory has been thoroughly debunked. Instead of being stripped of his gifts for the afterlife, Amenhotep I was, in fact, lovingly repaired and restored having been badly vandalised by grave robbers. The grave-robbing that plagues Egyptologists has a history as old as the mummies they study. Ancient papyri from the 10th and 11th centuries BC reveal how suspects were beaten with rods, forced to re-enact their crimes and then “impaled” once found guilty. The documents also show that the culprits were often the very men who had worked on entombing their former kings, taking advantage of their knowledge of where the mummies were buried and with what goods. The CT scans of Amenhotep I revealed tell-tale signs of grave robbing, such as post-mortem injuries to the abdomen, from tomb raiders trying to find amulets inserted into the body. With that being the case, it is likely that Amenhotep’s mummy was moved from his original tomb to Deir el-Bahari, near the ancient city of Luxor, in order to protect it from further desecration. ""We show that at least for Amenhotep I, the priests of the 21st dynasty lovingly repaired the injuries inflicted by the tomb robbers, restored his mummy to its former glory, and preserved the magnificent jewellery and amulets in place,"" said Dr Saleem. Amenhotep I and his mother, Ahmose-Nefertari, were worshipped as gods after their deaths. The care with which his body was treated, even five centuries after his death, is indicative of the reverence reserved for former kings in ancient Egyptian society. As well as the reasons for his transportation and rewrapping, researchers have finally been able to give an exact age for Amenhotep I - 35 - and reconstruct his appearance. According to the research paper: “Amenhetep I’s mummy has an oval face with sunken eyes and collapsed cheeks. The nose is small, narrow and flattened. The upper teeth are mildly protruding. The chin is narrow.” The thorough study of the millennia-old corpse also reveals new details about how Egyptian mummification changed over the course of 30 centuries. It is considered the first mummy of the New Kingdom to have arms crossed at the chest and not to have its brain removed. Despite all that has been revealed by modern medical technology, there remain substantial questions surrounding Amenhotep I. For one, the CT scan was unable to reveal the cause of death of the pharaoh. Nor have archaeologists been able to determine with any certainty where his original tomb lies. Dr Saleem said: ""We couldn't find any wounds or disfigurement due to disease to justify the cause of death.” Amenhotep I, whose name means ""Amun is satisfied"", was the second pharaoh of Egypt's 18th dynasty after his father Ahmose I. He is believed to have expelled the invading Hyksos and reunited Egypt and to have successfully invaded Nubia, to the south of his kingdom.",Science/The Telegraph,Secrets of only royal Egyptian mummy never to be unwrapped revealed thanks to CT scanner,https://news.yahoo.com/secrets-only-royal-egyptian-mummy-214330065.html

12/29/2021,"RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Conservation experts in Virginia’s capital Tuesday pulled books, coins, ammunition, documents and other artifacts from a time capsule found in the remnants of a pedestal that once held a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. The lead conservator for the Virginia Department of Historic Resources, Kate Ridgway, said that the measurements and material of the box, copper, match historical accounts. As the contents inside were unpacked, they appeared to match the description of the 1887 time capsule they had been looking for. “It does appear that this is the box we expected,” she told reporters. Records maintained by the Library of Virginia suggest that dozens of Richmond residents, organizations and businesses contributed about 60 objects to the capsule, including Confederate memorabilia. The box was discovered and carefully extracted from the monument site a day earlier, marking the end of a long search for the elusive capsule. Ridgway said the box, which weighed 36 pounds, was found in water in a little alcove of the pedestal. The contents were damp, but “it's not soup,” Ridgway said. “I think it’s in better shape than we expected,” she said. Historical records had led to some speculation that the capsule might contain a rare and historically significant photo of deceased President Abraham Lincoln. One line from a newspaper article also listed among the contents “picture of Lincoln lying in his coffin.” On Tuesday, conservators found a printed image from an 1865 issue of Harper’s Weekly in the time capsule that Ridgway said seemed to show a figure grieving over Lincoln's grave — which did not appear to be the much-anticipated photo. Harold Holzer, a historian and Lincoln scholar, had previously told The Associated Press he believed it highly unlikely that the time capsule contained an actual photograph of Lincoln in his coffin because the only known photo of Lincoln in death was taken by photographer Jeremiah Gurney in City Hall in New York on April 24, 1865. The contents of the tightly packed box had expanded from the damp and stuck together, making unpacking difficult, so conservators decided to relieve pressure by cutting down one side. “Not ideal but it’s the way it is,” Ridgway said. Northam ordered the enormous equestrian statue of Lee removed in 2020, amid the global protest movement sparked by the police killing of George Floyd. Litigation pushed back his plans, and the statue was not removed  until September, after a court cleared the way. Contemporaneous news accounts from the late 1800s detailed the placement of the time capsule in the foundation of the pedestal, and imaging tests conducted earlier this year appeared to confirm its existence. But a lengthy search during the September statue removal came up empty. Earlier this month, Northam ordered the pedestal removed as well, and crews working on the project again started to search for the artifact. A time capsule was discovered two weeks ago, generating excitement, but hours of painstaking and ultimately anti-climactic examination suggested that artifact was placed by someone else, perhaps someone involved with the construction.",U.S./Associated Press,Experts open time capsule found at Gen.
