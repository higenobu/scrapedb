5/16/2022,"A Sunday afternoon time vacuum engulfed Villa Park, two managers with an eye on both present and future leaving with a point and plenty to think about. Ollie Watkins’ second-half opener was cancelled out by substitute Jeffrey Schlupp: a result just about fair. Upward or downward mobility for both Aston Villa and Crystal Palace from here is minimal, and so these final throes of the season are a chance for Patrick Vieira and Steven Gerrard to split their gaze. Gerrard will be enjoying the flourishing partnership between Watkins and Danny Ings. In an age where two up top is unfashionable, Villa are going retro with some success. Watkins now has six in his past dozen league outings, while the pair’s wavelengths are increasingly in tune. That Villa failed to complete a seventh home league victory will irk Gerrard, however. Vieira will reflect on an excellent day for Eberechi Eze, who enjoyed himself operating alongside Conor Gallagher as one of two No 8s. It was his best outing since returning from the achilles injury cruelly suffered on the day he was named in England’s preliminary European Championship squad. Before kick-off, Villa had each home supporter waving a commemorative flag marking 40 years since the club’s European Cup triumph over Bayern Munich. The current players formed a pre-match guard of honour for the heroes of Rotterdam 1982. There was a little history for Palace, too: 500 Premier League games and counting. Not bad given their existence has been threatened several times. The cold reality though is that Vieira and Gerrard have very little interest in backward glances. Away games requiring passports is the latter’s long-term aim. That is why Philippe Coutinho’s loan move was made permanent, a four-year contract signed and a significant wage cut taken. Yet there was no samba beat here for the Brazil international. It is now nine without a league goal or assist for Coutinho. Vieira had taken the opportunity to experiment, a quartet of changes including Cheikhou Kouyaté added as a third central defender. And that brought some initial clunkiness which Ings will feel he should have exploited. First, Ings nipped in behind Joachim Andersen but steered Douglas Luiz’s cross wide. Then Andersen did well to intercept John McGinn’s attempt to find Watkins but the clearance fell kindly to Ings. His first-time volley troubled only the second tier. However Palace quickly grew in both stature and control. Eze dragged wide after being presented an opportunity by a rare Matty Cash error, before showing his vision to feed Wilfried Zaha. He turned, drove and the defence retracted. Emiliano Martínez’s palms were stung. The combination of south London’s king and heir apparent was a glimpse forward to make the Holmesdale Fanatics purr. If Vieira can also convince Gallagher his World Cup chances will be enhanced by remaining at Selhurst Park, the future could be very bright. Against the run of play Ings should have raised the home volume. Instead, he curled wide from after Watkins’ strong holdup play. While Ings failed to work the goalkeeper, Nathaniel Clyne had no such trouble, Martínez having to be alert to tip a low strike around the post. Any half-time fizz was flattened when Ezri Konsa went down and was forced off early in the second half having collided with Jean-Philippe Mateta. There was no writhing around in agony. In fact, Konsa barely moved. Fingers crossed. Frustration grew audible, the diagonal ball in behind now being dealt with by Palace’s back three. Gerrard bashed his hands together furiously. Zaha played pantomime villain, home fans goading him, only for the forward to smile and gesticulate for them to raise the volume. The Holte End pined for Emi Buendía but Jacob Ramsey, returning from injury, is who they got. And then they got something to cheer: Lucas Digne’s deep cross was poked home by Watkins. He did well to hold off the attention of Marc Guéhi, the pair engaged in some wrestling. Vieira was booked for his protests. Villa’s lead lasted just a dozen minutes. Andersen hooked a loose ball across goal, Guéhi flicked on and Schlupp ensured his impact was virtually instant, poking the ball into the net minutes after his arrival for Eze. Jack Butland’s injury-time double save from Digne and McGinn appeared to ensure parity. Watkins then wasted an opportunity when sent through. Fair is, just about, fair.",Sport/Football,Jeffrey Schlupp makes instant impact to earn Crystal Palace point at Aston Villa,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/15/aston-villa-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report
5/16/2022,"Saturday Night Live opens with a special report from MSNBC’s Nicole Wallace (Kate McKinnon). Despite the myriad catastrophes currently plaguing us – fallout from the January 6 subpoenas, the ongoing war in Ukraine and a nationwide shortage of baby formula – the program opens with coverage of “the Johnny Depp-Amber Heard Cuckoo Trial”. We go to live coverage inside the courtroom, where Depp (Kyle Mooney) smirkingly testifies about Heard allegedly pooping in his bed. Depp’s lawyer asks to show surveillance footage of the house staff discovering the mess and the judge allows it, “Because it does sound fun and this trial is for fun.” After it plays, the judge says she believes Heard did it, but also that Depp – a self-proclaimed “full nightmare” – drove her to it. Before you know it, the sketch is over. It’s obvious that SNL has been chomping at the bit to lampoon the Depp-Heard trial, and yet they rushed through it so quickly and with so little effort you have to wonder what the point of it was in the first place. Selena Gomez makes her debut as host. To prepare for the gig, the star turned to her Only Murders in the Building co-stars, SNL legends Steve Martin and Martin Short, for advice. Martin told her “Trust no one,” while Short said, “I think Steve Martin has been using my credit card”. She also mentions that she’s “manifesting love” in the hopes of finding romance on the show like other celebrities before her: Emma Stone and Dave McCary, Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost, “Pete and Machine Gun Kelly”. She subsequently shoots down the attentions of dweeby Mooney and James Austin Johnson, but seriously weighs an offer from Punkie Johnson. Gomez’s deadpan energy makes the monologue a bit of a snore. First up, a trio of Bratz dolls (Gomez, Bowen Yang, Aidy Bryant) come to life to console a young girl (Sarah Sherman) whose parents are divorcing. Their advice isn’t particularly helpful: they think her mom’s “a bitch” and are way too interested in her dad’s sex life. This is followed by an American remake of Netflix’s hit Japanese import Old Enough. Since Americans aren’t comfortable sending toddlers off on their own, this new version replaces them with long-term boyfriends. Thirty-four-year-old gamer Matt is sent off to run two simple errands, neither of which he manages to pull off. One thing SNL has been consistently good at over the last several years is harshly lampooning the arrested development of men in their 20s and 30s, with this being a prime example. That said, it’s more clever than it is laugh out loud funny. Next, Gomez and Melissa Villaseñor play Vanessa and Sofia, two cholas who host a public access talk show in Pico Rivera, California. Another noticeably formless shrug of a sketch, the only joke here is the girls’ penchant for quickly cutting off their guests and correspondents. Also – and this is coming from someone who grew up right next to Pico Rivera – neither Gomez nor Villaseñor’s accents are on point, both of them sounding like they hail from the San Fernando Valley than the San Gabriel Valley. A performance of the play A Storm Within – from which pictures of lead actor Rory McFadden’s live full-frontal nude scene recently popped up online – sees the roles taken by understudies after a Covid outbreak sidelines the regular cast. The new actors flub their lines and accents, leading to a fun bit of Who’s on First-style screwball before the lead barges on stage early and starts to unzip. Like almost everything thus far, this all comes to a surprisingly abrupt halt. A new episode of American Inventors covers the history of the whoopie cushion, the rainchild of one Archie Gizmo (Steve Martin). Gizmo tells how he was inspired by his muse, a flatulent woman named Dina Beans (Bryant) whose endlessly bad luck also inspired him to create Snakes in a Can, the hand buzzer, googly-eyed slinky glasses, electric gum and other novelty gags. It’s a very one note idea, but Martin’s warmly silly presence gives the episode a much-needed shot in the arm. On Weekend Update, Colin Jost gives a run-down of the week’s apocalyptic headlines, saying, “The entire crypto market has lost over a trillion dollars, but don’t worry: you can make that all back so long as you’ve been hoarding baby formula.” Speaking of babies, the first guest is Baby Yoda (Mooney), who announces he has a new spiritual outlook on life after going on a makeshift Ayahuasca retreat and joining a cult alongside Jared Leto, “Carlos Santana, featuring Rob Thomas”, Bob the Builder, and Tila Tequila. He feigns making peace with longtime enemy Baby Groot, before launching into his usual violent tirade against him. In a new twist on the format, Update follows “field correspondent” Sherman backstage for a tour. After a brief pitstop at her wardrobe rack (which include size zero pants), the only stop is Jost’s dressing room, or, “as our female interns like to call it, The Chamber of Secrets!”. There, she reveals a mirror pasted with pathetic daily affirmations, a caged intern and a creepy shrine dedicated to her (replete with a pair of her underwear) – all of which she’s clearly planted in an attempt to destroy Jost. Sherman manages to make the most of a flubbed piece of blocking, getting the biggest laugh of the night (from both the audience and Jost). The long-running joke about this one-sided rivalry continues to pay off, and it seems increasingly likely that the show is gearing up to hand Update over to Sherman at some point in the future. After her boyfriend (Chris Redd) leaves to run a sudden, suspicious errand, Gomez is visited by her intuition (Punkie Johnson), who raps about how “He at that bitch’s house” while convincing her to digitally spy on him and break his stuff. Redd responds to this by following his own jealous intuition (Post Malone), which leads to a big fight, which leads to angry sex. Yet another half-formed premise that doesn’t wrap up so much as it just stops. At a high school assembly, two guidance counselors address the senior class about post-graduation career paths. Their advice is simple: “Model. Get into modeling.” They bring Gomez’s former student-turned-model, who busts out poses and faces. She answers three student questions and then … that’s it. By far the laziest sketch in what has to be the laziest episode of the season. The show wraps up with Gomez’s high school student inviting a group of friends over to her house while she babysits her twin infant siblings (Yang and Sherman, both made to look extremely unsettling with the help of carrot-like wigs and white contact lenses). Instead of raiding her parents’ booze, the teens just want to watch the tots strange and violent antics on the baby cam. Some decently creepy effects, a slow building sense of dread and an honest-to-god ending make this the standout sketch of the night. It also has Sherman’s fingerprints all over it, so, combined with her Weekend Update segment, she proved the standout performer of the episode. Unfortunately, everything else was a total whiff. This wasn’t the worst episode of the season by any stretch, but it may be the most instantly forgettable.",Arts/Television & radio,Saturday Night Live: Selena Gomez fronts laziest episode of season,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/15/saturday-night-live-selena-gomez-host
5/16/2022,"A Middle Eastern telecoms group has taken a near-10% stake in Vodafone as the UK mobile phone company comes under pressure for a business shake-up. The state-controlled Emirates Telecommunications Group, which recently rebranded from Etisalat to e&, is now Vodafone’s biggest shareholder after confirming a £3.3bn raid on the UK group on Saturday. E& said it had made the investment “to gain significant exposure to a world leader in connectivity and digital services” and did not intend to launch a takeover bid, a statement which blocks the company from making such a move for at least six months. Vodafone claims on its website to supply government departments including the Ministry of Justice, meaning any new owner would have to be carefully vetted. The Abu Dhabi-based group, which has created a special holding company, Atlas 2022, to control the Vodafone stake, said it planned to be a “long-term and supportive shareholder in Vodafone and is not seeking to exert control or influence the company’s board or management team”. Vodafone’s chief executive, Nick Read, is under pressure to simplify sell off subsidiaries and improve returns after a more than 20% slide in its share price since he took over in 2018. E&’s involvement comes after Vodafone revealed that it was in talks with rivals in the UK, Spain, Germany and Italy, in an apparent response to pressure from Cevian, Europe’s largest activist investor, which took a stake in Vodafone and called for a business shake-up. Cevian, which is headquartered in Sweden and is known for taking longer-term positions to turn around businesses without taking aggressive action, is seeking a consolidation of Vodafone’s sprawling empire to focus on its most profitable markets and inject more telecoms experience at board level. Hatem Dowidar, the chief executive of E& who is a former Vodafone executive, added that he was “looking forward to building a mutually beneficial strategic partnership with Vodafone with the goal of driving value creation for both our businesses, exploring opportunities in the rapidly developing global telecoms market and supporting the adoption of next-generation technologies”. E& recently bought a controlling stake in Maroc Telecom and acquired the Emirati online grocery market ElGrocer as it aims to evolve into a global technology investment conglomerate. Vodafone, which is due to update the City on its full-year results on Tuesday, said that it looked forward to “building a long-term relationship with Etisalat” and that it continued “to make good progress with our long-term strategic plans”.

5/16/2022,"It is a bold author who heads off potential criticisms of their work with a self-aware allusion, but in Emily St John Mandel’s ambitious new novel, the character of the writer Olive Llewellyn is confronted by an unimpressed reader in a book-signing queue. Her interlocutor impatiently claims “there were all these strands, narratively speaking, all these characters, and I felt like I was waiting for them to connect, but they didn’t ultimately”. Some may agree with this as a description of Sea of Tranquility, but it also elegantly anticipates censure of this thought-provoking read. Over its spare length, St John Mandel’s book juggles a variety of storylines, loosely connected by the pivotal character of the time-travelling detective Gaspery-Jacques Roberts. He has been sent back from the far-distant future to interact with apparently disparate figures, from the 23rd-century novelist Olive to the disgraced “remittance man” Edwin St Andrew, making his uncertain way in 1912 Canada. The recurring motif that unites them all is the sound of a violin heard in an unnatural setting; its significance becomes increasingly clear as the narrative progresses. Anyone who has read Cloud Atlas – or indeed St John Mandel’s breakout novel Station Eleven – will be familiar with the time-hopping, symmetrical structure that she adopts, but this remains a fiercely original creation. Some aspects of the novel are especially enjoyable; the Olive strand, in which her book tour is imperilled by a deadly pandemic, combines satire with light-touch contemporary resonance, and the opening Canada material is so offbeat that you wish it could continue for longer. But the combination of speculative science-fiction drama with contemporary concerns grips throughout. Colonialism, misogyny and environmental disaster are all touched upon, but without unduly didactic emphasis. At one point, a character muses: “Isn’t that why we’re here? To leave a mark on wilderness?” St John Mandel’s tender and idiosyncratic novel will undeniably make its own mark on its readers’ imaginations.

5/16/2022,"The story is, by now, nauseatingly familiar. From Charleston to El Paso, from Pittsburgh to San Diego, and from Christchurch, New Zealand, to the latest scene of horror in Buffalo, New York, each of these mass shootings is stitched with one common thread: white supremacy. As investigators begin to piece together the details of Saturday’s massacre at the Tops Friendly Market that killed 10, the motivation of the murderer already seems in little doubt. The perpetrator appears to be a radicalized, lone white gunman, filled with racial hatred fueled by extremist theory widely available on the internet, who descended on a predominantly Black community in Buffalo, New York, heavily armed and determined to kill as many people as he could. The suspect, Payton Gendron, 18, is said to have etched a racial insult onto the barrel of his assault rifle before he live streamed himself gunning down grocery shoppers, supermarket staff and a security guard. Authorities said he also posted a lengthy “manifesto” to social media, with frequent references to a racist “white replacement” theory as justification for what they said was a “hate crime and racially motivated violent extremism”. Joe Biden, scores of American politicians, and community and civil rights leaders, including the Rev Al Sharpton, were quick to express their outrage, calling for more to be done to tackle the rise in hate-based crime in the US. But it’s a problem that has been getting worse in recent years, largely cultivated in the cauldron of the darkest reaches of the internet and eagerly seized upon by those all too willing to convert the skewed ideology into violence. The FBI reported last year that hate crimes in the US had risen to the highest level in 12 years, triggered largely by a surge in assaults on Black and Asian Americans. And while mass murders such as those in Buffalo and elsewhere understandably garner the most attention, many thousands of other violent hate-based attacks take place each year, leading attorney general Merrick Garland to make domestic terrorism and racially-based hate crimes “a top priority” for the justice department. “Hate and racism have no place in America,” Derrick Johnson, president of the national association for the advancement of colored people (NAACP) said in a statement following the Buffalo attack. “We are shattered, extremely angered and praying for the victims’ families and loved ones, as well as the entire community”. The parallels of Buffalo are significant not only to the August 2019 murder of 21 people at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, but also to countless other shootings involving a radicalized, solitary attacker. In El Paso, the gunman, a 21-year-old white male, also posted a document online, to extremist online message board 8chan, which stated the attack in the border town was “a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas”. Four years earlier, an attack on a Black community church by a self-confessed white supremacist in Charleston, South Carolina, left nine dead. In October 2018 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a white man shouted “All Jews must die” as he burst into the Tree of Life synagogue and shot dead 11 worshippers and wounded six others. Police later found anti-Semitic social media posts from the killer. And a similar shooting occurred at a synagogue in San Diego, California, in April 2019, when one person died and several others were wounded by a 19-year-old who also posted messages of racial hatred to 8chan. The San Diego killer claimed he was motivated by attacks on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, a month earlier in which a white supremacist murdered 51 Muslims. Investigators there quickly established the killer had been radicalized online, had posted his own manifesto of hate and live streamed the killings. To Sharpton, the veteran civil rights activist and television host, the latest attack in Buffalo is an urgent call to action. “President Biden should have a White House meeting of Black, Jewish, and Asian leaders to underscore the federal government’s escalating efforts against hate crimes,” he said in a tweet. “These hate crimes need to be met with a united front against hate-based violence.” The mayor of Buffalo, meanwhile, said on Sunday he believed the murders in his city will prove “a turning point”. “I would like to see sensible gun control. I would like to see ending hate speech on the internet, on social media. It is not free speech. It is not the American way,” Byron Brown said on NBC’s Meet the Press. “We are not a nation of haters. We are not a nation of hate. We need to send the message that there is no place on the internet for hate speech, for hate indoctrination, for spreading hate manifestos. “I will be a stronger voice for that. I believe that what happened in Buffalo, New York, yesterday is going to be a turning point. I think it’s going to be different after this, in terms of the energy and the activity that we see”.",News/US news,The Buffalo mass shooting comes amid rise in racial violence in US,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/may/15/buffalo-mass-shooting-rise-racial-violence-us
5/16/2022,"Patients having major abdominal operations should be offered the option of robotic surgery, doctors and scientists have said, after a world-first clinical trial found the procedures dramatically speed up recovery times, reduce complications and cut the risk of blood clots. In a first-of-its-kind three-year study, experts at University College London (UCL) and the University of Sheffield discovered that patients having robot-assisted bladder cancer surgery recovered faster and returned home sooner than patients who had open surgery. The findings were presented at the American Urological Association annual meeting in New Orleans, Louisiana. Robotic surgery reduced the chance of readmission by half (52%), and led to a 77% reduction in the prevalence of blood clots, when compared with patients who had open surgery. Researchers said the findings challenged the notion that open surgery was the “gold standard” for major operations. “This is an important finding,” said co-chief investigator Prof James Catto, a professor of urological surgery at the University of Sheffield. “Time in hospital is reduced and recovery is faster when using this advanced surgery. We see fewer complications from the improved mobility and less time spent in bed.” The trial ran from March 2017 to March 2020 and involved 29 surgeons at nine UK hospital trusts. A total of 338 patients with non-metastatic bladder cancer were split into two groups, with 169 patients having robot-assisted bladder removal and reconstruction, and 169 patients having open surgery. “Previous trials of robotic surgery have focused on longer term outcomes,” said Catto. “They have shown similar cancer cure rates and similar levels of long-term recovery after surgery. None have looked at differences in the immediate days and weeks after surgery.” Researchers found that, on average, the robot-assisted group stayed eight days in hospital, compared with 10 days for the open surgery group. Re-admittance to hospital within 90 days of surgery was also reduced, they said, at 21% for the robot-assisted group and 32% for those who had open surgery. Open surgery involves a surgeon working directly on a patient and involves large incisions in the skin and muscle, but in robot-assisted surgery, surgeons guide minimally invasive instruments remotely. Scientists behind the study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, said it provides the strongest evidence so far of the patient benefit of robot-assisted surgery. They are calling on the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (Nice) to make robotic surgery available as a clinical option across the UK for all major abdominal surgeries including colorectal, gastro-intestinal, and gynaecological. Prof John Kelly, a professor of uro-oncology at UCL and consultant surgeon at University College London hospitals, who was co-chief investigator, said: “In this study we wanted to establish if robot-assisted surgery, when compared to open surgery, reduced time spent in hospital, reduced readmissions, and led to better levels of fitness and quality of life; on all counts this was shown.” The “striking” reduction in blood clots was an unexpected finding, he added, which “indicates a safe surgery with patients benefiting from far fewer complications, early mobilisation and a quicker return to normal life”. “In light of the positive findings, the perception of open surgery as the gold standard for major surgeries is now being challenged for the first time. We hope that all eligible patients needing major abdominal operations can now be offered the option of having robotic surgery.”",News/Society,"Robot-assisted surgery can cut blood clot risk and speed recovery, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/15/robot-assisted-surgery-can-cut-blood-clot-risk-and-speed-recovery-study-finds
