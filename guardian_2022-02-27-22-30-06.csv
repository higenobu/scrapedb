2/27/2022,"Women in M*A*S*H (1970), Robert Altman’s boisterous comedy about a mobile army hospital during the Korean war, tend to get a raw deal. The actor Sally Kellerman, who has died aged 84, was still able to make the best of a thankless role. She received an Oscar nomination for playing the priggish Major Margaret Houlihan, better known by the nickname “Hot Lips”. In one scene, she is showering in a tent when the canvas is ripped away, exposing her to the rowdy applauding co-workers who have lined up their chairs to watch. “The first take, Sally hit the ground so fast that we couldn’t tell what she was doing,” said the director. For the second one, he and the actor Gary Burghoff stood “on either side of the camera with our pants down, so when the tent went up she saw the two of us standing there naked. That’s why she froze before falling, and how we got the shot we wanted.” In Kellerman’s recollection, there was a third take with yet another naked colleague off-camera. “[Altman] had Tamara Horrocks, she was the more amply endowed nurse, without her shirt on,” she said. “So I attribute my Academy Award nomination to the people who made my mouth hang open when I hit the deck.” Kellerman conceded that “there was a lot of chauvinism” in the picture, though she believed that the humiliation served an important function for her character. “She grew up after that,” she said. “She’d been so uptight, so rigid, no sense of humour – and after all that went down, she started having a really good time, a real life.” She also considered the film a personal turning point. “For the first time in my life I took chances.” In the director’s next film, the oddball comedy Brewster McCloud (also 1970), Kellerman played the mysterious Louise, who may be an angel or a reincarnated bird. Though she turned down a part in Altman’s Nashville (1975), she worked with him again on Alan Rudolph’s Welcome to LA (1976), which he produced, and is one of the many actors seen as themselves in his Hollywood satire The Player (1992). She appeared as a magazine editor, reportedly modelled on Liz Tilberis of Harper’s Bazaar, in Altman’s fashion-industry comedy Prêt-à-Porter (1994), and starred in an episode of the series Gun (1997), which he directed. Kellerman was born in Long Beach, California, to John Helm Kellerman, an oil executive, and Edith, a piano teacher. She was educated at Hollywood high school, where her talent for singing and acting first emerged. At 18, she was offered a contract as a singer with the jazz label Verve Records. She later claimed that stage fright put paid to her hopes of performing, but also that she declined the contract in favour of pursuing her acting career, having recently begun taking classes alongside Jack Nicholson. It was not until 1972 that she recorded her first album, Roll with the Feelin’. Her second, Sally, was released in 2009. While working as a waitress, she began to get small parts in film, television and theatre. She had one line of dialogue in Reform School Girl (1957), her screen debut, as well as in the horror movie Hands of a Stranger (1962). She appeared in television series including The Outer Limits, in which a part was specially written for her by Joseph Stefano, the screenwriter of Psycho (1960), who had seen her in a play. She wore silver contact lenses as a psychiatrist who develops godlike powers in a 1966 episode of Star Trek. In The Boston Strangler (1968), she narrowly escapes being murdered by the title character, played by Tony Curtis. She was in the 1966 stage version of Breakfast at Tiffany’s, starring Mary Tyler Moore and Richard Chamberlain. Beset by behind-the-scenes problems, the show closed after just four previews, having never officially opened. She also starred in the musical remake of Frank Capra’s 1937 melodrama Lost Horizon (1973), another notorious flop; its writer, the future activist Larry Kramer, described it as “the one thing I have done in my life that I truly regret.” She turned down most film offers after M*A*S*H to concentrate on touring as a musician. Exceptions included the Neil Simon adaptation Last of the Red Hot Lovers (1972) and the crime caper Slither (1973). At the end of that decade she twice played the troubled mother of a teenage girl – first with Diane Lane in A Little Romance (1979) and then Jodie Foster in Foxes (1980). Part of her skill was to bring charm and effervescence where previously there had been none, never more so than in her turn as a literature professor in Back to School (1986), a vehicle for the coarse, gravel-voiced comic Rodney Dangerfield. “The director said he felt that I helped make Rodney human, believable in a relationship,” she said. “Because I just had to love him and be sincere about it.” Other film work included Blake Edwards’s comedy-drama That’s Life (also 1986), with Jack Lemmon and Julie Andrews, and Henry Jaglom’s mockumentary Someone to Love (1987), which featured Orson Welles’s final film appearance. Between 2013 and 2016, she played the mother of the comic Marc Maron in his fictionalised TV series Maron. Kellerman was honest about having failed to capitalise on the success of M*A*S*H. “I began to believe my own publicity,” she said. “I’d been this overweight, not very confident girl, and now everybody was telling me I was the greatest … But instead I thought, ‘OK great, I guess I’ve got this acting thing down now. Time to work on my music’ … When it comes to building a career, I have never been the sharpest tool in the shed.” In 2013, she published her memoir, Read My Lips: Stories of a Hollywood Life. She is survived by Jack, her son from her second marriage, to the producer and manager Jonathan Krane, and by a daughter, Claire. Both Krane and Jack’s twin sister, Hannah, died in unrelated incidents three months apart in 2016. Her first marriage, to Rick Edelstein, ended in divorce in 1972.

2/27/2022,"The Home Office is expected to ease the rules for Ukrainians wanting to seek refuge in the UK after a minister provoked outrage by saying that people fleeing the war might be able to benefit from a visa scheme for fruit pickers. In an interview on Sunday morning the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said the UK would be welcoming refugees from the conflict and that a further announcement would be coming “very shortly”. She told BBC One’s Sunday Morning programme: “We’ve put support into the neighbouring countries like Slovakia and Poland to help with the refugee crisis. And of course Britain has always welcomed refugees fleeing from war, and we’re urgently looking at what more we can do to facilitate that.” Ministers have already announced minor changes to visa rules to help Ukrainians who are in the UK and unable to return home and people in Ukraine with British relatives. But Labour says the government should be going much further, and the row escalated when Kevin Foster, the immigration minister, posted a message on Twitter on Saturday night saying there were “a number of routes, not least our seasonal worker scheme” for Ukrainians wanting visas to visit the UK. Foster subsequently deleted his tweet, but David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, said it was “totally unacceptable” and that the government should be much more hospitable to Ukrainian refugees. Lammy told Sky: “We should have a scheme and a process similar to the scheme that we had after the Balkans. That’s as generous as the schemes that we’ve had in the past, when we allowed people to flee Idi Amin from Uganda, when we allowed people to flee Cyprus, when we allowed the Vietnamese boat people to enter our country. “That’s the sort of generosity that the British people expect. Frankly, suggesting that people should use this scheme that effectively fruit pickers come to this country on is totally, totally unacceptable.” Although the government is expected to ease visa restrictions for Ukrainians, people still in Ukraine who do not have British relatives are unable to make a visa application from that country. Ireland has dropped its requirement for Ukrainians to have a visa before they enter the country, although refugees will be expected to get permission to be in the country after their arrival. As an example of how the current rules are keeping people out, the Guardian has spoken to the daughter of 69-year-old widow who escaped from Kharkiv, where fighting is under way, who has been denied entry to the UK to join her daughter, a UK resident. The mother escaped to Hungary from where she took a flight to Paris – under European Schengen rules visa-free travel between countries is permitted for several months. From there she was hoping to fly to the UK to join her daughter, an academic who works in London and has indefinite leave to remain. But UK Border Force officials rejected the travel request and wrote on a form “no entry clearance”. “The Border Force official was quite defensive,” the daughter, who did not want to give her name, told the Guardian. “She said: ‘I can’t just allow her to come into the UK.’ She said that my mother could claim asylum in France. But she doesn’t speak the language and I want her to be with me for now.” The official said the mother could go to the British embassy in Paris on Monday and apply for a visit visa to the UK. However, those applying for a visit visa have to give an undertaking to return home after six months and at the moment with the uncertainty of the situation in Ukraine the Home Office could refuse to grant this kind of visa.",News/UK news,UK expected to ease visa restrictions for Ukrainians fleeing war,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/27/uk-expected-ease-visa-restrictions-ukrainians-fleeing-war
2/27/2022,"Michelle Obama would put Republicans “in a very difficult position” if she ran for president in 2024, a former Trump aide said, because the former first lady is both popular and “immune to criticism”. Monica Crowley, a former treasury spokeswoman, was speaking on Saturday at CPAC, the conservative conference in Orlando, Florida, at which Donald Trump strongly suggested he will run again in two years’ time. “If [Democrats] were to run Michelle Obama,” Crowley said, during a panel session, “that would put us in a very difficult position because they’d reach for a candidate who is completely plausible, very popular, and immune to criticism. “Also, when you think about her positioning, she [was a Democratic convention] keynote speaker in 2020, she wrote her autobiography [Becoming, a bestseller] and did a 50-city tour, she has massive Netflix and Spotify deals, and she’s got a voting rights group alongside [the Georgia politician and campaigner] Stacey Abrams.” Crowley, a sometime Fox News contributor, is well-connected in Trumpworld. In 2016, Trump sought to appoint her as a deputy national security adviser. She withdrew, amid allegations of plagiarism in a book about the Obama administration and in her PhD dissertation. Crowley called the allegations a “straight-up political hit job” but the book was withdrawn and updated. Columbia University concluded that Crowley’s PhD contained “localised instances of plagiarism” which did not constitute research misconduct. She became treasury spokeswoman in 2019 and, according to the New York Times, was “seen as a positive presence”. Obama is beloved among Democrats and polls highly in surveys of notional fields should Joe Biden go against all indications and decide not to run for a second term, and should Kamala Harris, the vice-president, not then secure the nomination. The former first lady has spoken up on key Democratic policies, including the need to protect voting rights. A candidacy is feared by Republicans all the way up to Trump, who according to the Wall Street Journal reporter Michael Bender was convinced Democrats would parachute Obama in to replace Biden at the 2020 convention. But she has repeatedly said she has no wish to enter politics as a candidate. In 2018, she told a conference in Boston: “The reason why I don’t want to run for president … is that, first of all, you have to want the job. “And you can’t just say, ‘Well, you’re a woman, run.’ We just can’t find the women we like and ask them to do it, because there are millions of women who are inclined and do have the passion for politics. “I’ve never had the passion for politics. I just happened to be married to somebody who has the passion for politics, and he drug me kicking and screaming into the arena.” Obama has also said she would like to retire – or spend more time “chasing summer”. Her husband has said: “Michelle will not run for president. I can guarantee it.” Still, some Republicans still appear to fear Obama could somehow be dragged into a race against Trump. Crowley said: “For all of these people who say, ‘Michelle Obama isn’t political … they’re making too much money now,’ keep a very close eye on her because her trajectory is exactly what Barack Obama did before he ran for president and what Bill and Hillary Clinton both did. “I think if she were to run, that would be a very difficult situation for us.” Crowley also said she thought Democrats would need to appeal to Black women, particularly if Harris could not secure a post-Biden nomination. Contrary to Crowley’s claim, Michelle Obama’s “trajectory” does not seem similar to that of her husband or either Clinton. A successful lawyer and popular first lady, she has never run for national office, let alone been a senator (Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton), governor (Bill Clinton) or secretary of state (Hillary Clinton again). She has however given well-received speeches at Democratic conventions – including a heartfelt expression of support for Biden, her husband’s vice-president, and criticism of Trump, in 2020. “Let me be as honest and clear as I possibly can,” she said then. “Donald Trump is the wrong president for our country. “He has had more than enough time to prove that he can do the job, but he is clearly in over his head. He cannot meet this moment. He simply cannot be who we need him to be for us. It is what it is.”",News/US news,"Republicans fear Michelle Obama presidential run, ex-Trump aide says",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/27/republicans-michelle-obama-presidential-run-trump-monica-crowley-cpac
2/27/2022,"We usually love cities for the attractions they offer, but the city of Lisbon is more of an attraction in itself. There are exquisite museums and splendid palaces to visit, but whatever you choose to do, the real star of the show is always the city itself. In some ways it’s a fantastically complex destination – centuries of colourful history piled on top of itself, all wrapped up in dozens of eclectic architectural delights (Romanesque, Gothic, Manueline, baroque, Modern, postmodern), which teeter precariously on seven steep hills overlooking the majestic River Tagus. It’s almost impossible not to get lost. But it’s also a very simple place to go to. All you actually have to do is stroll along its myriad narrow cobblestone streets, marvel at the beautiful tiles that pattern the walls of both ancient and modern buildings, and soak up the warm sunshine. In fact, your only real dilemma is wondering which boisterously good restaurant you’ll eat dinner in. While ancient Lisbon assaults the senses, the modern city that flanks the old quarter is all calming boulevards, breezy roof terraces and large open squares that have been laid out since the capital’s last great reinvention of itself – the result of a devastating earthquake in 1755. Moving between the old and new parts of the city is endlessly fascinating. And underlying everything is an appreciation of the finer things in life. From Pastel de Belém, Lisbon’s world-famous pastry, to bacalhau (salted cod served in at least 350 different ways), your taste buds will be as exhausted as your legs. Head to a flea market Feira de São Pedro is held on the second and fourth Sunday of every month. It’s a huge flea market that dates back to the time of the Christian Reconquest, but it’s still very much alive and kicking. You’ll find stalls heaving with pottery, leatherwork, local antiques and handicrafts, as well as amazing olives, cheese and spiced meats to tempt you. Take a tram The city is crisscrossed by beautiful trams – No 28 is perhaps the most well known. The little wooden wagons clunk and groan up vertiginous streets as you perch on tiny wooden benches inside. Many of the yellow trams are listed as historic artefacts and all are lovingly maintained. A single journey is €3, or buy a one-day travel card for €6.40. Go to church There are dozens of churches worth visiting – from small painted chapels to towering gothic masterpieces – and all are free to enter. One that will have your eyes bulging is the Igreja de São Roque. It’s one of the earliest Jesuit churches in the world and supposedly the most expensive ever built. It’s a baroque bonanza and the walls are studded with the heads of thousands of gaudy, chubby little cherubs. 1908 Lisboa Hotel Occupying one side of the revitalised Largo do Intendente – a pretty square which is a favourite with locals – the 1908 is named after the year in which architect Adães Bermudes created the original building. It’s filled with art, design and unusual touches, and has a lively restaurant and buzzy bar on the ground floor. Be sure to book the curved corner room, no 111, which has 14ft ceilings and three huge windows (rooms from €99, 1908lisboahotel.com). Hotel Bairro Alto Sitting between two totally contrasting neighbourhoods – the elegant Chiado on one side and the bohemian Bairro Alto on the other – this sumptuous hotel is one of the grandest in the capital. Over the past couple of years it has been completely remodelled. Its restaurant now features the ambitious cooking of Nuno Mendes – formerly the executive chef at Chiltern Firehouse, London. Enjoy an evening cocktail on the hotel’s glamorous roof terrace with views across to the harbour and the bridges of the Tagus (rooms from €323, bairroaltohotel.com). The Lumen Located in the heart of the city and opened last August, the Lumen takes its name from the famous light that Lisbon is blessed with. They’ve taken this theme a step further with an immersive light and colour experience projected on to the walls of the hotel’s central garden. More than that, there’s a glorious rooftop deck and a swimming pool lined with bright red tiles. Lie back and enjoy amazing views across the old city as you sip a cocktail and nibble almonds and olives. Rooms are large, modern and unexpectedly affordable (from €77, lumenhotel.pt/en). Ofício Lisboa Don’t be put off by the decor at Ofício, which makes you feel as if you are in the basement of a large aquarium. The food is sensational (go for the seafood) and the prices are weirdly cheap for the effort that has clearly been involved with each meticulous dish (oficio-restaurant.negocio.site). Cavalariça Lisboa There’s a huge stuffed unicorn on the wall, surveying you as you eat – and there is clearly something magical about this place. Modern interpretations of traditional Portuguese classics will have you licking your lips in wonder (cavalarica.com). Comptoir Parisien Head to Belém not just for the finest custard tarts on the planet (you can buy them in boxes of 40), but for a cheap and cheerful lunch in the sunshine. Lining the little street behind the pastry shop you will find a run of friendly cafés serving sardines, prawns in garlic, chips, tomato salads and carafes of cold sangria. Locals flock here at the weekends. The Comptoir Parisien is good, but so are many of the others – just choose a terrace and a table you like (restaurante-comptoir-parisien.com). Everywhere you will see beautifully packaged tins of sardines. The prettiest are from Conserveira de Lisboa, established in 1930. They’ve taken the art of tinned fish to a whole new level (conserveiradelisboa.pt/en). Over the past decade, Porto’s undergone a renaissance. Split by the gleaming Douro river, it’s small enough to cover the main sights in a long weekend, but has enough interest to keep you exploring for weeks. Wander down the steep, cobbled streets to the historic Ribeira waterfront (a Unesco world heritage site) and you’ll find it buzzing day and night, with live music, and endless places to eat. Cross the double-decker Dom Luís I bridge, built by a student of Gustave Eiffel in 1886, and you can wander around the separate town of Vila Nova de Gaia. This is the home of Porto’s most famous product: port wine. The city’s elegant buildings are packed into the hilly landscape, many of them decorated with azulejos, the stunning blue and white tiles that are a defining feature. A more modern take is the cutting-edge street art that adorns walls across Porto. If you decide to walk everywhere, don’t forget comfortable flat shoes. But if you get tired, many classic trams crisscross the city. There are fabulous independent stores selling local produce, crafts, cool interiors, books and hip fashion. Don’t miss the Rua das Flores and while you are here, stop off at the Mercador Café for a quick snack. If you’re feeling energetic, climb the 240 steps of the Torre dos Clérigos for a great view across the city. You’ll also want to visit the city’s Sé cathedral with its 12th-century Gothic rose windows. If you can face the crowds, the bookshop Livraria Lello (made famous by the Harry Potter films) is eccentric and delightful. For more down-to-earth purchases, go to Mercado do Bolhao, specialising in meat, fish, fruit and flowers. The historic building has been closed for restoration, but should reopen soon. A visit to Porto wouldn’t be the same without investigating the many well-known Port wine cellars in Gaia. They’re often open for visitors, with tours and tastings (we enjoyed Taylor’s). And before you go, be sure to take a six-bridges cruise along the Douro. It may feel touristy, but there’s no better way to appreciate this stunning city than from its water. Enjoy a picnic Just across the Dom Luís 1 bridge in Gaia, you’ll find the Jardim Do Morro. It’s the perfect place to watch the sun set over the city. Go on a gallery tour Head to Rua de Miguel Bombarda for its myriad of art galleries. You’ll also find great restaurants, bookshops and design, music and fashion. Pop into the O! Galeria illustration and art gallery. You can follow Porto’s street/graffiti art trail here, as well on the Rua das Flores, Rua da Madeira, Travessa de Cedofeita and many more streets across the city. Eat A LOT of Pastéis de Nata Try the old-school patissiere Confeitaria do Bolhao (1896), or the super-cute Nata Sweet Nata in Ribeira, right on the waterfront. Gran Cruz House This cool, heritage boutique hotel is located right on the riverside in the bustling Ribeira. It is owned by the port brand Gran Cruz and all the bedrooms, named after port types, have views over to the port houses of Vila Nova de Gaia. A highlight is the intimate Casario restaurant with traditional Portuguese dishes and a wonderful choice of wine (rooms from €100, grancruzhouse.pt). Torel Palace Porto A stunning new hotel in what was a 19th-century palace. Every inch of the ornate interior – including the remarkable interior skylight – has been beautifully restored. Rooms are spacious, elegant and super-luxurious. There’s an outdoor swimming pool and spa treatments. The food here is excellent (see also Blind restaurant below; rooms from €220, torelpalaceporto.com). Rosa Et Al Townhouse An intimate design hotel with just seven suites in the heart of the Cedofeita arts district. It has a tranquil garden to relax in and offers in-room spa treatments. The hotel’s delicious and informal restaurant serves some of the best brunches in the city. Don’t miss their other restaurant, Early early.pt; rooms from €128 with breakfast, rosaetal.com). Semea by Euskalduna One of the most exciting restaurants in town, with wonderful views across the Douro, the concept here is all about sharing plates and the kitchen is all about fire. The fresh fish and seafood is incredible. Our favourite was skate, grapes and mushrooms and pica pau (which means woodpecker, but is actually spicy beef or pork). Plus, the French toast and cheese ice-cream dessert is worth the trip alone (semeabyeuskalduna.pt). Blind at Torel Palace The restaurant pays tribute to Portuguese writer José Saramago’s novel, Essay on Blindness. Eating here in near darkness is an extraordinary culinary magic show, gasp-worthy at times – to explain would ruin so many surprises (blind.pt). Manna Homely, relaxed vegetarian restaurant serving organic, vegan and vegetarian dishes. The coffee is top notch, and the pancakes legendary. Also hosts yoga and meditation classes (mannaporto.com). Claus Porto is Portugal’s celebrated soap brand, famous for its stunning packaging and delicious scents. Its flagship shop in the Rua das Flores is simply beautiful. If you’re in need of refreshing after a hard day’s sightseeing, this is the place. Pop in to wash your hands at the large basins on the ground floor and enjoy the wonderful atmosphere. There’s also a fascinating museum upstairs (clausporto.com). Essentials Combining a visit to both cities on a single trip is easy – and the 320km journey between the two is a good chance for some extra sightseeing. The train takes 2.40 hours and costs from €31. The bus takes 3.30 hours and costs from €19. Both have multiple services every day.

2/27/2022,"Tate Modern’s enormous and surprising Surrealism Beyond Borders is a round-the-world tour of what must be the 20th-century art’s most far-reaching movement. It has Austrian totem poles and Egyptian fetishes, paintings from Sweden and Senegal to Haiti and Cuba, silent movies filmed in New Zealand and Colombia (The Blue Lobster, co-scripted by Gabriel García Márquez) and photographs from just about everywhere that André Breton’s call to astonish, disrupt and rifle the unconscious was ever heard. Eighty years of art are condensed with extraordinary agility into a sequence of galleries that dramatise the transit of this comet right cross the globe, without sticking to conventional geography or chronology. Unfamiliar art from beyond the usual European circuit is subtly interspersed with old classics so that they appear on equal footing. A sinister Portuguese sculpture, featuring a cloven buffalo hoof topped with an all-seeing eye, appears next to one of Marcel Duchamp’s caged readymades. Magritte’s train rushes out of its famous fireplace alongside Japanese painter Koga Harue’s painting of a bathing belle standing triumphant between a zeppelin and a submarine (made nine years before), and both visions appear surpassingly strange. Marcel Jean’s startling Armoire surréaliste opens the show: a painting of (and upon) partly opened wardrobe doors, drawers and panels through which – look closely – two different landscapes can be hauntingly glimpsed, rocky below, sunlit above. It was made in 1941; Jean was trapped in Hungary, unable to return to France, so that the closet is intensely poignant. The lives of other surrealists were equally interrupted. In Japan, the movement flourished before the second world war but was forced underground immediately afterwards. In Romania, its brief moment during that war was suppressed by the Soviet invasion. The protagonist of The Flat, a 1968 film by the Czech genius Jan Švankmajer, is trapped in a dingy apartment where the objects set up an oppressive (read communist) regime against him. His soup spoon is full of holes, his boiled egg cannot be cracked and the bed tries to suffocate him with sawdust. Surrealism Beyond Borders would be worth seeing just for this superb satire alone. But there is so much more. The photo-collages of the German artist Grete Stern play with scale to the most outlandish effect. The three striding boots in Brazilian painter Tarsila do Amaral’s cityscape all have the weirdest critter faces. The photomontages of the Iranian artist Kaveh Golestan fuse human beings and animals into hybrids so eerie they feel like Freudian archetypes. Once seen, never forgotten. It is true that some strains of surrealism appear tenaciously dominant. There are galleries full of trance-induced drawings, psychic automatism, creepy crawlies and gross bodily extrusions straight out of Dalí. Black hats, broken statues, bare-breasted torsos: some tropes remain the same all over the globe. And a section titled The Uncanny in the Everyday looks dated and bland to the modern eye. Photographs of the Sphinx hotel in Paris, the bombed-out stomach of a classical caryatid in Brno, or the mannequin so positioned in natural light that it appears to come strangely alive: this is routine snapping and tweeting today. But it throws the focus upon incongruity, the bizarre and the dreamlike: a sense of what it is to be human in this alien world, no matter where you are. Anxiety in Syria, hallucinations in Lagos, visions of birdlike nuns cycling through Mexico: pure surrealism is a vision unimpaired by reason, proportion or mundanity. What becomes increasingly apparent, through this show, is the way surrealism grows more political the further its shock waves travel from the French point of origin. It feels enormously more about radicalism – the horrors of war, famine, torture, oppression – than dreams, or the writhings of the psyche. Several painters reprise Picasso, at Tate Modern, but none more pungently than the South Korean Byon Yeongwon, with the torn and running figures in his violent Pangongyohan (Anti-Communist Female Souls). But the Japanese artists may be the greatest revelations here. Kikuji Yamashita’s 1967 painting Deification of a Soldier invokes his horror as a Japanese conscript sent to fight the Chinese in the second world war: a crucifixion of helmets, howling mouths and broken body parts, presided over by an imperial figure with a cocked rifle. It is an indelible nightmare of remorse and cruelty. There are so many works in this show, by so many different artists (almost 150) that not everything will be of equal fascination. There is dilution and regurgitation. Some of the painting is barely proficient, the content mattering above all else. And surrealism, especially across almost a century, occasionally repeats itself as kitsch. Enrico Baj’s monster Gollum bestriding a dainty Alpine landscape undoubtedly relates to cold war anxiety, as we are told, but it is a ludicrous B-movie of a painting nonetheless. There are so many unfamiliar names here, and such arcane discoveries, that anyone remotely interested in surrealism might consider investing in the massive and phenomenally detailed catalogue by Matthew Gale and Stephanie D’Alessandro, curators of this exhibition, along with their contributors. It is filled with tales of subversion, acts of bravery, romantic liaisons and all sorts of international collaborations from pyramid letters to road trips to movies and the surrealists’ favourite game, Cadavre exquis, where each artist draws a body part and passes it on. Conceivably the longest game ever played was organised by the black American artist Ted Joans (who called himself a “Sudanese Chirico”). He gets a lot of airtime here, not least because he once lived with the great jazz saxophonist Charlie Parker. Joans’s beautiful commemoration of Parker hangs high on a wall – a tragic, humped silhouette of a painting titled Bird Lives! The game Joans began in 1975 involved 132 contributors, all over the world, and it runs the full length of the room. It feels like an emblem for this inexhaustible movement, for it continued even after his death in 2003. It is said that surrealism attuned our eyes so that we now see incongruities everywhere; just as we never saw fog, quipped Oscar Wilde, before Whistler started painting it. His remark is worth bearing in mind at the Royal Academy for the degree of celebrity it recalls. For it is all but impossible, now, to imagine the controversy roused by Whistler’s Symphony in White, No 1: The White Girl. This 1862 painting of a red-haired woman with vacant green eyes, dressed in white muslin against a white damask curtain, a white lily dangling from one hand, is now the very cynosure of aestheticism. But in those days the girl was an enigma. Was she a virgin, new bride, fallen woman (the lapsing lily) or some kind of enchantress, dominating the wolfskin (or is it a bear?) beneath her feet, its red tongue hanging from open jaws? The small but beautifully focused Whistler’s Woman in White: Joanna Hiffernan examines the row, and the relationship between Whistler and Jo Hiffernan, his Irish model, lover and amanuensis for more than a decade. Their life together unfolds in his art: Jo by the Thames at Wapping, lying on the studio couch, surrounded by japonaiserie, on a trip to Trouville where they meet up with Courbet (three of whose magnificent seascapes star alongside Whistler’s diaphanous equivalents). Most fascinating are the prints, where Whistler finds so many ways of describing the shimmer and fall of Jo’s amazing copper tresses, and the curious changeability of her face, with its full lips and long nose. The show is haunted by other women in white: pre-Raphaelite damsels, wilting virgins, fashionable reprises of The White Girl by lesser painters; a marvellously dynamic poster for a dramatisation of Wilkie Collins’s The Woman in White (1859), from which Whistler borrowed more than the title.

2/27/2022,"“People ask what it is,” says Gbolahan Obisesan, artistic director of Brixton House theatre, “and then they’re pleased that it’s not an office block.” A passerby does just that, as I stand outside the building’s dark metallic exterior. Such reactions are symptomatic of the current politics of development in Brixton, where some residents see new buildings as the means by which new money pushes out uses essential to established communities. The theatre, though, offers a way round such issues – it proposes a way of investing in the area that, in theory, could benefit everyone. Brixton House is the reincarnation of an old south London theatrical institution, Ovalhouse, known for its pioneering fringe productions since the 1960s; a place that nurtured talents including Tamsin Greig, Pierce Brosnan, David Hare and Salman Rushdie, and an early supporter of gay, lesbian and women’s theatre. Ovalhouse strove to connect community, politics and art, helping the first pride festivals in neighbouring Kennington Park and giving space to groups such as the British Black Panther party. Now, by moving a couple of miles from its old location by the Oval cricket ground, it is inserting itself in the charged and fertile territory of central Brixton. The neighbourhood is one of the nation’s foremost zones of contention in ongoing debates about gentrification. It is a classic case: a celebrated centre of Afro-Caribbean communities, famous for its venues and markets, now finds itself intensely attractive to buyers looking for a bit of urban vibrancy with good transport links. Prices go up, for homes to buy and rent, and for businesses. Outlets in the markets that once served local people give way to purveyors of niche forms of coffee, bread and home furnishings, with wry names and crisp, well-educated graphics. The very qualities that made these places special get eroded. The communities who made a place what it is find it suits them less and less well. Opponents of these changes then face a conundrum: how to challenge them without also pitting themselves against things that in normal circumstances would be good, such as jobs, investment and refurbishment of the physical fabric. In principle, everything is possible. It should be achievable to distribute the wealth generated by development in such a way that everyone benefits. In practice, that doesn’t happen very often. In Brixton, these debates currently crystallise around the proposed “Hondo Tower’’, 200,000 sq ft of office and mixed-use development rising at one end to a height of 20 storeys. It is a work of raw brick and concrete by the celebrated architect David Adjaye, with dramatic diagonal struts and a brutalist-looking atrium containing market stalls. Its developer is Hondo Enterprises, a company owned by Texan property developer and part-time DJ Taylor McWilliams, which controversially bought Brixton Market in 2018. Hondo says that Pope’s Road, to give the project its official name, will deliver 2,000 jobs, 2,000 sq ft of community space, more market stalls and other benefits. The Save Nour campaign, named after a popular local shop that was served an eviction notice, call it a “massive monstrosity” whose employment opportunities would mostly go to people outside the borough of Lambeth in which Brixton sits. They regard Hondo’s offer to pay £40,000 a year to a “Brixton job training fund” as derisory. In December, a mini-documentary about the project was made by young local film-makers. Hondo, said Hiba Ahmed, a ex-resident interviewed in the film, are “taking a heritage that has been built by diaspora communities… they’re going to do their best to profit from it and if that means displacing people who have been there many years they’re very comfortable with that”. Last year, Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, decided to “call in”, or review, the planning permission granted to the proposals. His decision will turn – or should turn – on the question of whether Hondo would truly give back enough of the profit it would extract from being located next to the popular market. Meanwhile, Brixton House theatre offers a model for bettering a place in a way that strives to engage with the people who live there. This too is partly enabled by property deals; in this case, it forms part of the Somerleyton Road development, where the London borough of Lambeth hopes to build an enfilade of housing blocks between a railway viaduct and what was, before postwar rebuilding, a handsome, tree-lined, Victorian avenue. Some of the money for the theatre comes from the sale of its former site at the Oval. The core aim of the new building is to provide upgraded facilities, in particular two studio theatres, which can be operated separately or together, offering a wide range of different configurations of stage and seating, with better facilities for lighting and sound and improved accessibility. With capacities of up to 220 and 120 respectively, the two spaces represent only modest increases of the equivalent spaces in the old venue. The object is not empire-building, but to continue to do what Ovalhouse did, only better. The hope is to keep ticket prices low, in the range of £10 to £21. The aim is to encourage a community of performers and artists closely connected to the part of London in which the theatre sits. Rehearsal and meeting spaces on the upper floors, which make a large part of the building, will be available to groups outside the theatre. Carlton Mansions, an adjoining Victorian block of railway workers’ flats, has been converted by another practice, Zac Monro Architects, into affordable workspaces for the creative industries. The idea, Obisesan has said, is to be “forward thinking, community focused and rebelliously outspoken”. The history of Brixton, he believes, “is proudly political and its rich blend of cultures will inspire the new theatre to be a cradle for startling stories and extraordinary art”. The opening programme includes Tonderai Munyevu’s Mugabe, My Dad and Me, a personal account of the impact of the Zimbabwean dictator on the author’s life, and Hussina Raja’s Station, which is billed as “an interactive live performance installation set in a traditional south Asian living room”. In all this, the building, by the architects Foster Wilson Size and the contractor Galliford Try, acts as relatively neutral frame for whatever life the theatre might generate. The architects have gone for a “studio aesthetic”, with something of the spirit of Brixton’s industrial past. The organisation is straightforward: a bar and foyer with a long glass frontage on to the street, a direct ground level route to the two auditoria, a central atrium and staircase around which the upper-floor world of rehearsals will revolve. Animation, apart from the daily living theatre of the building’s users, will come from a coloured LED lighting display on the exterior and digital screens. Two vigorous works of art stand in contrast to the sober architecture. One is Nuclear Dawn, a mural painted in the wake of the 1981 Brixton riot, painted the full height of the side wall of Carlton Mansions, a document of the fears of the time in which a giant skeleton, clad in the flags of the atomic powers, scatters missiles across a London sky. This has been restored and the new building respectfully cuts back to make a little plaza in front of it. The other work is a newly commissioned, graffiti-like mural that climbs up the lift shaft, a piece on the “energy of Brixton” by the south London artist and illustrator Damilola Odusote. The architecture’s self-effacement is a wiser path than gesture and ego, though the building could do with one or two more signs that this a place of joy and drama. Perhaps then people would be less likely to mistake it for an office building. It could also be taken as a commentary on the dominant black-grey palette that, at Obisesan’s insistence, the central stair has been painted bright pink. Then again, it’s to the building’s credit that it can take this intervention with good grace. You could imagine that a few more tweaks like this would, over the years, really bring the building to life. The greater significance of the theatre will be what it is and what it does – whether the promises of outreach and connection are fulfilled. Such promises are often made, but, partly because of this theatre’s history, the chances look good that it will keep them. As an architecture critic, my instinct is to favour Adjaye’s muscular and confident design. But in terms of its contributions to a neighbourhood, Brixton House looks like the more promising proposition.",Arts/Art and design,A tale of two buildings: Brixton House theatre and the Hondo Tower,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/27/a-tale-of-two-buildings-brixton-house-theatre-and-the-hondo-tower
2/27/2022,"The green fields and woods of rural Northamptonshire look as apparently immutable as much of the British countryside. Next to the remote farm of Blackgrounds, however, a thin layer of innocuous green pasture has been peeled back. Below the surface is revealed a cobbled Roman road, walls, wells, pathways and shops: a bustling, prosperous international settlement long lost to memory. The town, its people and stories are emerging because it is part of the biggest-ever archaeological excavation in British history. It is one of more than 100 digs and investigations along the 134 miles of the HS2 high-speed rail route being built between London and Birmingham. Part of £900m of “enabling works” for the much-criticised project. Other discoveries beneath this long swath of middle England include a neolithic timber henge aligned to the winter solstice near Wendover; Roman statues of a man, woman and child beneath an abandoned Norman church at Stoke Mandeville; and the body of captain Matthew Flinders, who led the first circumnavigation of Australia, one of more than 50,000 skeletons exhumed from a burial ground beside Euston in London. My tour of Blackgrounds begins in a fuggy shipping container crowded with laptops, tools and new finds that is the site office for Mola, one of the commercial archaeology companies involved in digs for HS2. Since a law change in 1990 required developers to undertake rigorous archaeological investigations before construction work, a profession once seen as the preserve of the youngest sons of aristocrats (private income required) has been able to earn its keep outside academia. “You’re standing next to two dead people,” says James West, project manager at Blackgrounds, as I change into the requisite fluorescent orange safety gear. Two black buckets are filled with carefully bagged bones, yellow from centuries in the soil. West first came to Blackgrounds in 2018 to dig some test trenches to assess what might be here. A Roman villa had been found nearby in the 1830s, but had been “very poorly dug and recorded” by a typical amateur Victorian excavation. But the name of the place was a clue that there could be more. The wider area’s soil is mostly pale brown, but Blackgrounds was named after its strikingly dark soil. This soil was created by people. “There’s a really black deposit on top of everything – that’s the abandonment layer. It’s dark because of all the organic material – the wood and bones, it just leeches into everything,” says West. His test trenches revealed stonework, glass, metalwork, pottery. “I knew there was something special so I lobbied quite hard to get back here,” he says. What’s been discovered – an Iron Age settlement that subsequently became a prosperous Roman trading town – “has exceeded my expectations. The scale and the quality of finds is more than we thought. To find iron shackles and pottery decorated with hunting scenes and an undiscovered town in the middle of South Northamptonshire is a bit of a shock.” The scale becomes apparent in the fields, as 70 archaeologists pick over the soil while the sound of drilling pierces the still winter air (it turns out to be a woodpecker on a nearby oak). There are yellow diggers (“big trowels”) removing top layers, followed by archaeologists with their builders’ wheelbarrows, pick-axes, and trowels, of course. “If it’s all by hand we would be here for a very long time, but British archeology is really good because it’s still hand-digging and that gets a lot of people in,” says West. His team includes Spanish, Greek, French, German and Australian archeologists. “It’s one of the best jobs I’ve been on because there’s always something new to excavate and everyone who comes in has a different way of seeing things.” The expanse of cobbles and neat kerbs that is the Roman road is “massive”, says West. “Most Roman roads are 4-5m wide at a push. To have one 10m wide is quite exciting.” The picture emerging is of the lost road connecting to the nearby Welsh Road, a beautiful old droving lane. In the town, the road would have been a “dual carriageway” so multiple carts could pull up and unload without causing a traffic jam. Alongside the road are the bases of large Roman walls displaying the kind of skilled stone masonry we might associate with a Norman cathedral. West says the town was well planned with walkways, retaining walls, markets and homes built in stone to chest-height with long-vanished wooden upper parts. Finds include scale weights and bars – suggesting thriving trade – but also rings, necklaces, hair-pins, pottery from France decorated with a lion chasing a gazelle, and an iron leg shackle. These paint a picture, but also create further blank canvases. “Is the shackle for criminality or indentured slavery?” asks West. “We know the Romans kept enslaved people, but it’s very difficult to find evidence of it.” The team has found more than 1,000 nails and 400 coins. Every find, no matter how trivial, is recorded on GPS. Its location – and depth – is crucial data. “On a normal site, if you find a coin it’s a special thing, whereas here there is something every day,” says West. Right on cue, there’s a beep from the metal detector being swept across the soil by Phil Holt of Red River Archaeology. Is his detector good? “Well, it’s two grand,” Holt laughs. “It’s very good at depth and discrimination and it will tell me on a screen how deep it is. If it’s too deep, I’ll wait until the next context [layer of soil] comes off, so I can record the find in context.” This beeping is caused by a coin. “There’s a lot of crud stuck to it so it’s hard to see,” says Holt, carefully removing soil. He likes coins because they can often pinpoint a date to within a decade: this one is third or fourth century, British minted. Most of Blackgrounds’ coins are late Roman, minted cheaply in Britain in the reign of Constantine II in the fourth century. Coins made statements. A Valentinian coin depicts the Emperor dragging a captive with him. “It’s propaganda. A lot of coins celebrate the conquering of people. Romans are like that.” HS2 is much criticised for its conquering of the countryside but archaeologists are adamant that without all the earth-moving it creates, these kinds of discoveries would not be made. “Nobody would have known this was here,” says Holt. “We’re making new discoveries all the time. It’s recorded well and saved for future reference.” “If HS2 wasn’t being done there wouldn’t have been any work in this area,” adds West. “Commercial archeology is preparation for building work. If the land is going to be used for something else, I’d like to go in and understand what’s there so people after me can understand it. What we’re doing is going to be looked at for generations.” Blackgrounds still has further treasures to reveal. The road will be removed to examine what lies beneath – usually a trove of lost objects. West is particularly excited by a beautifully preserved stone well. They will soon dig down to its bottom. “This is the cherry on top,” he says. There will be more coins, votive offerings and dead animals, he predicts. “We did find a dead person in the bottom of one once. He didn’t go in voluntarily.” The dead provide particularly intriguing puzzles from the past. In low-ceilinged offices on an Oxford industrial estate, archaeologists for Copa, a consortium of archaeology companies assembled to meet the demands of HS2, are poring over finds from another HS2 sight – Fleet Marston, a deserted medieval village west of Aylesbury. Here, they found another undiscovered Roman town with two cemeteries containing the remains of 325 people. Once again, there are clues in placenames: a nearby farm, Putlows, could refer to bodies “put low”. Annsofie Witkin, an osteoarchaeologist, is examining the skeleton of a woman in her early 20s. Much is written in our bones, from patterns revealing chronic infections to clues about lifestyles. The bones of an 18-year-old found at Fleet Marston reveal he was suffering from a lung infection. “We cannot say how he died unless we find a knife stuck in his back, but we can find evidence that alludes to it,” she says. The woman has good teeth while the fusing of certain bones reveals she was over 19 and under 28. She was 5ft 7in, but was already showing signs of osteoarthritis in her wrists: she had laboured, hard, from a young age. “What is quite unique about this burial is it is a deviant practice within the Roman burial tradition.” Witkin pauses. “She was decapitated after death.” Decapitation in Roman burials is “extremely rare, if unheard of on the continent,” says Witkin. In Roman Britain, it constitutes around 2.8% of all inhumations. At Fleet Marston, 10% are decapitated. “Somehow, I don’t think all of them would be due to crime,” says Witkin. The woman’s head was found placed over her feet. Beside her was buried a 34-week-old foetal child. “We don’t yet know if it’s hers or not,” says Witkin, who hopes DNA analysis will solve that mystery. Cuts on the vertebrae reveal the woman was decapitated from the front with a fine blade; it took six cuts for her head to be severed. “It could suggest it was someone who was not well practised at this. One is very shallow. Perhaps it’s a hesitation cut. Perhaps it’s a family member or close relative who has to do this. Perhaps it was a traumatic miscarriage and they are distraught.” As the archaeologists point out, there is so much more to discover even after their reports are written (an HS2 spokesperson says it intends to ensure that finds are displayed, both in local and national museums). Isotope analysis of bones from Fleet Marston, for instance, could detect mineral traces within them and show where people were born and raised, revealing patterns of mobility across Roman Britain and its empire. Individual mysteries are compelling, but the archaeologists are excited by the big data collectively generated. “Getting the human stories is really important, but because of the number of burials they all contribute towards something bigger because we can draw the data from other sites and see trends in Roman-era population and health across a much wider area,” says Edward Biddulph, a senior project manager for Copa. Richard Brown, another Copa project manager, brings up a map of Buckinghamshire on his computer screen. It looks busy and well-peopled, but the roads and towns are all Roman. “HS2 is starting to populate this map of Roman Britain,” he says. The “new” town of Fleet Marston, at a crossroads of Roman roads, is one big example. The significance of the HS2 excavations is their sheer quantity, argues Brown. “Quantity is good. HS2 saw this coming and prepared for it: how the archaeology is addressed and where the sites are. It’s well planned so we have time to do the job properly and everything else – the big data – comes from that. We can start drawing conclusions from these large bodies of data because of the scale of it.” At Blackgrounds, the finds are providing further evidence of a blending of Iron Age and Roman cultures rather than a traditional conquest and replacement narrative. “The big research question is what evidence is there of a transition from Iron Age to Roman? We’ve answered that question pretty thoroughly,” says West. “We think they are still using the old ways, taking the good bits from the Romans, but still keeping their identity as Iron Age people.” At Fleet Marston, the significance of the decapitations and the status – Christian or not – of the burials is the big question. Richard Brown says, “Drawing conclusions about early Christianity or them not being Christian is not possible. It’s often the same with archeology: it’s about masses of data rather than specific, single headline-grabbing finds. It’s nice that it’s not fixed and known.” He smiles. “I’d be out of a job if it’s all known.”",News/Science,Ticket to Roman Britain: HS2’s route to ancient history,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/27/ticket-to-roman-britain-hs2s-route-to-ancient-history
2/27/2022,"The last album from everyone’s favourite tie-over-T-shirt pioneer was 2019’s underwhelming, dreich Head Above Water. Which, thanks to the pandemic, feels like yesterday and a decade ago all at once. Love Sux finds Avril Lavigne returning to the early 00s pop-punk roots that made her name and produced MTV-saturating hits such as Sk8er Boi. It’s a nostalgic vibe heightened by this being Lavigne’s first record released on Travis Barker (of Blink-182)’s DTA label, and there’s a collaboration with the band’s singer, Mark Hoppus, on All I Wanted; perhaps the album’s best track. It’s all much needed, high-energy fun. Lead single Bite Me is a vengeful crash of drums and guitar directed towards an ex who gets short shrift throughout (F.U. is lyrically typical in its “I’m over you” refrain), and, in an enjoyable twist, Bois Lie has rapper Machine Gun Kelly playing the ex. The uncharitable take would be that a 37-year-old still writing lyrics in txt spk is quite cringe, but the truth is that Love Sux – three-minute banger after three-minute banger, complete with classic Lavigne “woah-oh-ohs” – is exuberant enough to have you slipping on a pair of Vans and partying like it’s 2002.

2/27/2022,"When the African American writer and anthropologist Zora Neale Hurston explored the southern states in the 1930s, as well as including a pen and paper in her luggage, she packed a gun. The author, whose novels included the much admired Their Eyes Were Watching God, was spiky and fearless, often travelling in dangerous territory where a lone Black female reporter attracted unwelcome attention. In recent years, new works by Hurston – work either previously unpublished or short stories collected together for the first time – have been eagerly anticipated. Books such as Barracoon (2018), Hitting a Straight Lick With a Crooked Stick (2020), and now You Don’t Know Us Negroes, a collection of nonfiction pieces, have meant that Hurston, who died in 1960, has now garnered more fans than when she was alive. The essays demonstrate the wit of a pioneering star of the Black literary circle dubbed by Wallace Thurman “the Niggeratti” (a title she endorsed) during the short-lived Harlem Renaissance. But, at its height, when Hurston and her contemporaries laid claim to modernism, she also accented the primacy of the African American working-class “voice”, which was disparaged by the Black middle-class. Writers such as James Weldon Johnson had sought to “tidy up” Black vernacular forms in standard English. Hurston, on the other hand, was determined to preserve the brilliance of “Black English” in traditional cultural forms, whether embellished by preachers or embedded in folk tales – an approach that the most influential Black critic Alain Locke thought was retrograde and unsophisticated. Throughout the essays, she’s critical of those who attempt to co-opt downtrodden African Americans for their own ends; Hurston reserves special contempt for Marxists and their Black literary advocates such as Richard Wright, who cast Black life in terms of victimhood, as “units of oppression”. A Black man’s life, she argues, is as varied, full of love and hate, as any group: “When his baby cuts a new tooth, he brags as shamelessly as anyone else without once weeping over the prospect of some Klansman knocking it out.” She’s prescient, too, about white editors keen to demonstrate their bona fides while advancing writing that conforms to their own misperceptions. After Black Lives Matter, British publishers caught in the stampede to diversify their lists should be directed to Hurston’s excoriating essay about tokenism, The “Pet Negro” System. Her irreverence towards received opinions and opinion-makers is one of the delights of Hurston’s shtick. She dismisses Black critics who believe she’s letting the side down in her depiction of so-called unedifying stereotypes. She called the snobbish Locke, who negatively reviewed Their Eyes Were Watching God, a “fraud” whom she’d send her “toenail to debate him on what he knew about Negroes”. She has little time also for the inflated attention given in literature to those “passing” for white: “Only a few self-conscious Negroes feel tragic about their race and make a cage for themselves.” Fierce, insightful and often devilishly funny, her satirical writing is particularly biting. But while in The Emperor Effaces Himself, she lampoons the Black nationalist leader Marcus Garvey, who “expressed a fearful lack of confidence” in appointing himself the ”provisional president of Africa”, she champions his belief in Black self-pride. Controversially, she doubts the value of the US supreme court ruling to end segregation in the public schools of the south, challenging the old assumption that “there is no greater delight to Negroes than physical association with whites”. Further, she’s alarmed that it will sound the death knell for historically Black colleges and universities, which, though poorly funded, had thrived and educated students beyond the curriculum in how to survive in their hostile racist homeland. Survival sometimes requires compromise. Though her novels idealise Black self-sufficiency, Hurston was practical, too, recognising her dependence on patrons such as Charlotte Osgood Mason, who endeavoured to push Hurston’s writing towards a kind of African exoticism, as the price for her support. Hurston’s anthropological reportage seems now a precursor of the New Journalism later exemplified by Joan Didion. In Ruby McCollum Fights for Life, Hurston writes poignantly about a Black woman put on trial for shooting to death a white man. Innovatively interspersing court records with her own interviews, Hurston shows how Ruby’s fate will be determined by a judiciary scandalised by her affair with the deceased; she had one child with him and was pregnant with another – details overlooked by the prosecutors who called for her execution. A detailed investigation also informed the oral histories Hurston collected for the Federal Writers’ project in the aftermath of the Wall Street crash. Her meagre income from writing, though, wasn’t sustainable. She spent her last years working as a maid, cleaning houses for white people whilepretending to be carrying out research into domestic service if any friend questioned her. A pitiful end but, as seen in this new collection, the depth and power of Hurston’s prose continues to dazzle. Like the African American preachers whom she admired, she articulates “that consciousness of the inexpressible and a hunger for beauty”.

2/27/2022,"After more than two years as essential workers on the frontlines of the Covid-19 pandemic, grocery store workers around the US are pressuring supermarket corporations to raise wages and improve working conditions amid record profits for the industry. Ahead of the expiration of their union contract, 60,000 grocery workers at subsidiaries of Kroger and Albertsons in California are holding actions outside stores, demanding at least a $5 wage increase over three years, improved safety and security for workers, improved staffing and eliminating the two-tier system of workers. James Peete has worked as a food clerk at Ralphs, a subsidiary of Kroger, in Glendale, California, for nine years. During the pandemic, Peete claimed his department and store has been understaffed to a skeleton crew. “When we had a lot of people out with Covid, I was working 12 to 15 hours, six days a week, and so were many of my co-workers,” said Peete. Peete said that with every new contract, Ralphs tries to expand the classification of workers under general merchandise, which pays less at $16 an hour, forcing many workers to work multiple jobs to make ends meet. When the City of Los Angeles enacted a $5 an hour hazard pay for grocery workers for four months in early 2021, Kroger shut down three local stores, and Peete argued management pressured workers to ramp up production during those periods. “In their most profitable years ever, closing stores down to punish us for getting hazard pay definitely ruined morale. Like many of my coworkers, when we got that $5 an hour pay increase temporarily, we were pushed incredibly hard,” Peete said. Grocery workers around the US have expressed similar grievances throughout the pandemic, as pay has lagged behind while these workers were expected to continue working throughout the pandemic, with thousands of workers contracting the virus, and workers frequently facing abuse and assaults from customers over enforcing safety protocols. John Grant, the president of UFCW Local 770 union, argued the Covid-19 pandemic revealed how indispensable grocery workers are to the communities they serve and their employers, while putting themselves at risk for wages that aren’t enough to make ends meet. “This is the opportunity to rebalance the work in the grocery industry,” said Grant. “These used to be career jobs where people could sustain their family, live the American dream of being able to support themselves and send their kids to college, and it’s just been ripped apart and gutted. Companies can’t claim any longer an inability to pay or hide behind some economically thin margins. Their profits are obscene.” Kroger reported profits of $2.8bn in 2020. In 2021, Kroger reported even higher profits in its first three quarters of the year, with its fourth quarter results expected to be released in early March. The company authorized a $1bn stock buyback program in 2021. Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen received $22.4m in compensation in 2020, 904 times the median worker pay. Albertsons also reported record profits in 2020 of $850.2m after its stock first went public in June 2020 and has seen its stock price nearly double since then. “We’re asking for at least $5 over three years. We’re simply trying to just make ends meet, especially here in California being so expensive,” said Christie Sasaki, a cashier at Pavilions, an Albertsons subsidiary, in Beverly Hills, California, for more than 20 years. “We all work terribly hard in the grocery industry. It’s been a tough two years, with the unknowns, and Covid, changing constantly. I go to work, often in fear, and hope that I don’t become ill or die.” More than 8,000 grocery workers represented by UFCW in Colorado went on strike at Kroger-owned subsidiaries in January 2022, while other UFCW local unions representing thousands of grocery workers are in the midst of new contract negotiations with Kroger and other grocery corporations. Tina Sanchez, who has worked as a service deli manager at Vons, a subsidiary of Albertsons, in Oxnard, California, for 22 years, said the pandemic has been crazy for grocery workers, as customers were hoarding food products and she was working 10- to 14-hour days to keep up with the surge in demand. “A lot of us feel that it’s been profit over people. They got that money so quickly that they had never seen before and they just wanted more. They didn’t care that people were tired, that I was working six, seven, 18 days in a row. It didn’t matter,” said Sanchez. Sanchez claimed her department is understaffed, operating with three workers with limited hours, when she used to run a crew of nine. She also explained the common cut injuries and dangers associated with working in the deli, the risks she and other workers have taken while working through the pandemic as higher management workers in offices were able to work from home. “We’ve had people that come into the store from higher management telling us ‘if you get that $5 an hour increase, you are going to get less hours. Why is it a punishment to ask for something that we deserve?” she asked. A spokesperson for Kroger said in an email the company is still negotiating with the unions and committed to reaching a new agreement for Ralphs associates, claiming the average associate wage is nearly $19 an hour. But the firm did not add specifics on company proposals or comment on workers’ claims of understaffing and increased workloads. “It’s important to note that more than 50% of our 17,000 bargaining unit associates have been with the company for 10 or more years, reflecting good, stable jobs in southern California. Bottom line: We want to continue to significantly invest in our associates’ wages, and industry-leading health care and pension benefits while also keeping groceries affordable for local shoppers,” the spokesperson said.

2/27/2022,"All eight Slovenian MEPs have weighed in to a ding-dong in a small town in northern Italy, calling on the European Commission to act to “protect traditions” after an Italian judge silenced a church’s bells. For some in Dolina, a town with a minority Slovene community close to Italy’s border with Slovenia, the bells of Sant’Ulderico church were essential to the rhythm of their day, with the tolls not only informing them of the start of mass, a feast day or when someone died, but also serving as a clock. For others, the “loud and excessive” ringing was a bane, leading to a petition that in turn led a judge in nearby Trieste to remove the bells in an unprecedented ruling. “Fines have been given to Italian parishes if bells are too noisy, but they have never been confiscated before,” said the parish priest, Klemen Zalar. “This reaction was a bit too heavy.” The row has embittered the population of 4,800, drawing accusations of personal vendettas. It began during Italy’s tough coronavirus lockdown in spring 2020, when the automatically operated bells became intolerable for some residents stuck at home. “It was bam-bam, bam-bam all day long,” said Mauro Zerial, the organiser of the petition, who counted 550 strokes a day between Monday and Saturday, and 1,350 on a Sunday. “It would start at 6am, with 70 strokes for the Ave Maria, then seven at 7am, and then every 15 minutes until another long ring for the start of evening mass. It was crazy. But nobody wanted the bells to be silenced, we just wanted them to be operated within the norms. And in no way was this an attack against Slovenian traditions.” Dolina, in the semi-autonomous Friuli-Venezia Giulia region, was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire until the area was annexed by Italy after the first world war. Today, some of the population speak Slovene and hold dual citizenship. Zalar said the bells’ schedule was very much in tune with the way bells are traditionally used in churches in Slovenia. A malfunction caused by lightning in 2019 occasionally set the bells off spontaneously, but Zalar claimed the ringing was never excessive, and said some of the 150 citizens who signed the petition were duped into believing they were supporting a cause to get the bells fixed. MEP Ljudmila Novak said the issue was raised in Brussels after members of the Slovenian community in Dolina turned to her and her colleagues “in distress”. “The Slovene minority is protected by special laws so that it can preserve its national identity and customs. These laws also include church rites,” she said. “We ask the commission in what way it will act to eliminate the disproportionate interference with religious freedom and cultural tradition in an area where the autochthonous Slovenian national community lives.” The bells were relinquished by the judge in late January, albeit with an order for their use to be restricted. But silence prevails as the church struggles to come up with a ring schedule adapted to the new rules. Sara Merlak, who collected signatures for the petition, claimed they were forced to turn to the judiciary after the church failed to collaborate. “All we wanted was for the Ave Maria to be moved to 7am,” she said. “Now we all miss the bells.”",News/World news,Turmoil in small Italian town after judge silences church bells,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/27/turmoil-in-small-italian-town-after-judge-silences-church-bells
2/27/2022,"Amust for fans of the Foo Fighters, particularly fans who don’t mind seeing members of the band chainsawed in half, Studio 666 is an enjoyably schlocky comedy-horror. Dave Grohl gamely hams it up as a man possessed – first by an-out-of control ego, and later by the forces of darkness during a recording session at a mansion steeped in bloody rock’n’roll history. The running time is an issue – a punchy seven-inch single approach would have been preferable, rather than this jam session of a screenplay, which doesn’t know how to end. But the tonal blend of goofy and gory is oddly endearing.",Arts/Film,Studio 666 review – Dave Grohl hams it up in oddly endearing comedy-horror,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/27/studio-666-review-dave-grohl-hams-it-up-in-oddly-endearing-comedy-horror
