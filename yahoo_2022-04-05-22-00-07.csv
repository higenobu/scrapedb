4/5/2022,"Three people have been charged with capital murder in connection with the brutal rape and murder of a teen girl who was shot before she was raped and then dumped on the side of a Mississippi road. Jackson Police Department Deputy Chief Deric Hearn announced during a press conference on Friday that Dewitt Anderson, 34, Cedric Banks, 37, and Kaymia Blackmon, 19, have been arrested in connection with the February murder of Amya Carey, 18, WLBT reports. Carey’s body was found on Feb. 15 in a wooded area off a road north of downtown Jackson. She had been sexually assaulted and shot three times. It took more than a month — until March 24 — for her remains to be identified, WAPT reports. All three suspects appeared in court on Thursday where bond was denied for the trio, WJTV reports. At least Blackmon was familiar to the slain teen: A relative of Carey’s told investigators that Carey was picking up Blackmon, whom she considered a friend, and Blackmon’s boyfriend, the 34-year-old Anderson, the night that she was killed. Hearn said that at some point in the night, the three were then joined by Banks, who is Anderson's brother, according to WLBT. He said that all three suspects tried to convince Carey to have sex with them, but she turned them down. That, in turn led to a fight between the slain teen and Blackmon, and during that dispute, Blackmon's boyfriend, Anderson, allegedly shot Carey, WLBT reports. Then all three allegedly put the teen — who was severely wounded — in a car. One of them then allegedly raped her as another drove. Hearn said it’s unclear if the teen was still alive at that point. Banks then allegedly shot Carey two more times before the trio dumped her body. On March 30, Blackmon and Anderson were called in for questioning and allegedly described the events of the evening to investigators. It’s not clear if any of the three suspects has lawyers that can speak on their behalf.",U.S./Oxygen,Three Charged In Connection With Murdered Teen Who Was Raped After She Was Shot,https://news.yahoo.com/three-charged-connection-murdered-teen-220717586.html
