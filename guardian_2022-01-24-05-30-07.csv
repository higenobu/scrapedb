1/24/2022,"This season’s Heineken Champions Cup has been a logistical nightmare but the tournament’s knock-out stages could yet offer some seriously good viewing. Despite the Covid issues that prompted the cancellation of several games in the past month, some potentially fierce two-leg contests now await in the last 16. Leicester, the current Premiership leaders, now face a fascinating home and away duel with Clermont Auvergne while the English champions Harlequins will be up against Montpellier, who have managed to sneak into the last eight despite shipping 89 points at Leinster in round three.  Among the other stand-out ties will be the all-Irish encounter between Leinster and Connacht and a Parisian ‘derby’ between Racing 92 and Stade Français. The defending European champions Toulouse also face a potentially tricky assignment against Ulster while last year’s beaten finalists La Rochelle are involved in another all-French rendezvous with Bordeaux. Bristol, for their part, can look forward to an all-English collision with Sale, which will at least simplify the travel arrangements of both sides, and Munster will meet Exeter following a fluctuating final afternoon of pool action. Exeter’s see-sawing 37-26 loss in Montpellier and Wasps’ convincing 45-7 defeat at Thomond Park ultimately tipped the balance, with a total of five English clubs joining seven French sides and four from Ireland in making it through the pool stages. The quarter-final lineup is also looking tasty with Leicester, if they progress, potentially in line to meet Leinster in the last eight. Quins, similarly, would be up against the winners of La Rochelle v Bordeaux with a trip to Paris to face Racing 92 potentially in wait for either Bristol or Sale. Not for the first time, Exeter were indebted to the outstanding Sam Simmonds who scored a hat-trick of tries to sustain a contest which Montpellier led 24-5 at one stage. The dynamic Simmonds, playing his 100th senior game for the club, scored his first within the opening four minutes only for Montpellier’s forward power to wrest back control and lay the platform for tries from the French internationals Anthony Bouthier, Paul Willemse and the ex-Springbok centre Jan Serfontein. The Chiefs, though, refused to lie down with Simmonds collecting his second before the centre Seán O’Brien grabbed an interception score. Stuart Hogg thought he had scored his side’s fourth try just before the interval, only for it to ruled out for a supposed knock on, but Simmonds’ third try after 50 minutes, following 20 patient phases, briefly put Exeter in front. A 69th-minute interception try from Cobus Reinach, however, ultimately settled a full-bore contest. In Limerick Wasps needed a losing or a try bonus point to progress but such objectives were overshadowed by the sight of their flanker Thomas Young being carried off on a stretcher and taken to hospital for scans after sustaining a neck injury following a collision at a ruck late in the first half. Even before Young’s spirit-sapping departure, things were already going awry for Wasps. Munster had lost Dave Kilcoyne and Keith Earls shortly before kick-off but first-half tries by Conor Murray, Simon Zebo and Jack O’Donoghue gave them a handy cushion. A close range snipe from Robson gave his side a flicker of hope only for Jeremy Loughman, Rory Scannell and a second try from Zebo to extinguish it. Cardiff, who did their best to fly their flag for the Welsh regions in often trying circumstances, were edged out of contention by a remarkable final quarter in Paris where a 14-man Stade Français recovered from 31-20 down to beat Connacht 37-31 with the final kick of the match. They will now drop into the last-16 of the Challenge Cup along with Wasps, Northampton, Bath, Castres and Glasgow but this season’s European adventure is now over for the bottom-placed Ospreys and Scarlets. Saracens kept alive their chances of progressing with a 45-24 win over London Irish. George Ford, meanwhile, is set to join England’s training camp in Brighton this week following Owen Farrell’s latest injury setback. Ford was omitted from Eddie Jones’s original squad last Tuesday but is now in line to return to the matchday squad for the Calcutta Cup fixture against Scotland at Murrayfield on Saturday week.",Sport/Sport,Leicester to face Clermont and Exeter take on Munster in Champions Cup draw | Robert Kitson,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/23/leicester-to-play-clermont-and-exeter-face-munster-in-champions-cup-ties
1/24/2022,"Antonio Conte bemoaned the “incredible” decision to disallow Harry Kane’s first-half strike as his unbeaten league start as Tottenham manager came to an end against Chelsea, before admitting his former club are on “another level” to his present squad.  Kane appeared to have put the visitors into the lead at Stamford Bridge before the referee, Paul Tierney, adjudged the England captain had fouled Thiago Silva as the ball was played into his path. From there, second-half strikes from Hakim Ziyech and Silva inflicted a first league defeat on Conte at Spurs, as Chelsea ended their recent shaky form with what ultimately turned out to be a comfortable 2-0 victory. Conte, however, could not hide his disbelief at the decision from Tierney. “To see this type of goal disallowed in England, it was incredible,” he said. “Maybe in Italy ... 50-50, but in England it was incredible.” With the Premier League now on its winter break, attention at Tottenham turns to the remainder of the transfer window. Conte again appeared to underline his belief that this team are some way adrift of the league’s top sides with his post-match comments about Chelsea. “They’re much stronger than us as a team and a squad – we tried everything to get a result here,” Conte said. “Despite that, sometimes it’s not enough, especially when you play against this type of team. They’re very good and this club are on another level compared to us.” Tottenham have won just once at Stamford Bridge since 1990, and this latest defeat gave Chelsea valuable breathing space above Manchester United in fourth. Had they lost here, the prospect of being dragged into a scramble for Champions League qualification would have been a possibility, but Thomas Tuchel was delighted with the manner of his side’s victory. “The effort was outstanding and it was a deserved win,” Tuchel said. “It’s hard to create chances against them but we were relentless. It was a good team effort and an excellent result.” The second half was overshadowed by an incident when Chelsea’s Antonio Rüdiger appeared to be struck by an object from the travelling supporters. Both managers said they had no information on the incident afterwards, but Tuchel said: “I sent the message [this week] that everyone needs to show respect and behave. If this is a new trend, we should act together so that it stops as soon as possible.”",Sport/Football,Antonio Conte bemoans ‘incredible’ decision to chalk off Harry Kane goal,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/23/antonio-conte-bemoans-incredible-decision-to-chalk-off-harry-kane-goal
1/24/2022,"Unilever is expected to face pressure to shake up its business model after it emerged the activist investor Nelson Peltz has built a stake in the troubled FTSE 100 company. The consumer goods company, best known for Dove soap, Hellmann’s mayonnaise and Marmite, has been thrown into turmoil after a £50bn tilt at GlaxoSmithKline’s consumer healthcare division caused fury among its shareholders.  On Sunday the Financial Times reported that Trian Partners, Peltz’s New York-based hedge fund, had taken a position in the UK group, adding to the problems of its embattled chief executive, Alan Jope. Martin Deboo, an analyst at investment bank Jefferies, said the “fox would now appear to be inside the henhouse” and predicted a positive share price reaction on Monday morning. “Trian has a long and successful track record of unlocking value,” said Deboo. “This has frequently centred on splits and spin-outs.” He added: “We have long been of the view that the right path to unlock value at Unilever is via a faster rate of disposals from its slow-growing foods businesses, or a separation between foods and household and personal care, via a sale or spin [out].” The size of Trian’s stake is not known but in the past the hedge fund has taken positions of 1%-3.5% in target companies. Unilever declined to comment. Trian could not be reached for comment. Deboo pointed to Peltz’s role in the shake-up of the now defunct Cadbury plc more than a decade ago. He prompted the business to split into separate companies, one focused on confectionery and the other on soft drinks. The restructuring led to a listing of the soft drinks arm and the eventual sale of Cadbury to Kraft. Last week Terry Smith, the founder of Fundsmith and one of Unilever’s top shareholders, described the company’s failed offer for GSK’s consumer healthcare division as a “near-death experience” and said management should focus on improving its core business – or step down. GSK rejected three Unilever bids for the consumer products arm, the last of which was worth £50bn. However Unilever investors balked at the blockbuster deal and started dumping their shares. The revolt drove its share price down by as much as 11%, however, it regained some ground after Unilever promised not to raise its offer any further. Smith had already declared that Unilever had “lost the plot” accusing management of burnishing its sustainability credentials at the expense of business performance. He mocked its desire to own brands with “purpose”. “The Hellmann’s brand has existed since 1913 so we would guess that by now consumers have figured out its purpose (spoiler alert – salads and sandwiches),” said Smith. The furore saw Jope rush out a strategy update in which he promised to grow its health, beauty and hygiene business and sell slower-growing operations. There is also more change on the way with the company set to unveil a new “operating model that will drive greater agility”.",News/Business,Pressure for shake-up expected at Unilever as activist investor buys stake in firm,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/23/pressure-for-shake-up-expected-at-unilever-as-activist-investor-buys-stake-in-firm
1/24/2022,"Police suspect that a dead man who was brought to a post office in Ireland by two men trying to claim his pension had died just hours before the incident. Gardaí have ruled out foul play, with a postmortem revealing he had died not long before the alarm was raised at Hosey’s shop and post office in the town of Carlow, in County Carlow.  Two men had reportedly attempted to collect 66-year-old Peader Doyle’s pension on Friday morning but were told by staff that the pensioner had to be present at the counter himself. According to reports in Ireland, the two men returned a short while later appearing to prop up a man wearing a woolly jumper over his face and a hat on his head. Onlookers claimed his feet were “dragging” along the ground on the journey from his house a short walk from the shop. A shop worker became concerned, asking if Doyle was unwell. The two men then departed, leaving the dead man behind. No money was handed over to the men, and staff in the shop raised the alarm with emergency services. Garda sources told the Irish Times that one line of inquiry is the possibility that his death occurred in the post office. In that case no criminal charges would arise as no offence would have been committed. They are now examining CCTV footage of the 500-metre stretch between Doyle’s house and the post office to establish his condition before he arrived. A local priest was called to the scene by gardaí to give the man his last rites. “It really is shocking. People in the town are clearly shocked, but he did get prayers and he was anointed,” Father John Dunphy told Irish media. “The shop was closed, and I didn’t know the man, but the staff were upset, naturally. He was anointed; he got the last rites, of course, and we all gathered around him and prayed. It was very dignified. “The gardaí were very kind and the staff were brave. It was a peaceful moment, very, very dignified.”",News/World news,Irish police rule out foul play over corpse in post office pension incident,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/23/ireland-carlow-death-post-office-pension
1/24/2022,"A committee of MPs has produced a report criticising the gambling industry regulator for trying to reduce addiction and urging ministers to take it into special measures. The findings by the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on betting and gaming have been described as “ludicrous” by a campaigner for regulatory reform and met with a frosty reception from the regulator.  The APPG describes itself as a political “go-between” for the sector and is one of hundreds of parliamentary groups that have come under scrutiny for alleged ties to lobbying. Several of its members have faced criticism for taking thousands of pounds worth of freebies from betting firms. It launched an investigation into the Gambling Commission last year. When asked to share its findings, the group refused. But the Guardian has obtained a draft excerpt of its report. The MPs’ draft labels the commission “in urgent need of change” and says it is too harsh and risks “the destruction of one of the world’s best gambling industry’s [sic],” leading to growth in the black market. It accuses the commission of “acting ultra vires [beyond its remit] in its strategy of seeking to significantly reduce the number of problem gamblers”. The MPs accuse the regulator, which has adopted a tougher stance amid rising public concern about gambling addiction, of displaying a “bullying attitude that has caused mental harm” within the industry and calls on the government to take it into “special measures” while determining whether it can “continue as it is”. The intervention comes weeks before the government is due to publish the results of a once-in-a-generation review of gambling laws, with the commission thought to be playing a major part in finalising proposals. Several of the MPs on the APPG have fielded criticism for accepting freebies from the gambling industry while advocating for it in parliament or in the media, although it is not against parliamentary rules for them to do so. The group’s chair, the Conservative MP Scott Benton, accepted £7,494.60 worth of tickets last summer for Euro 2020 and Ascot courtesy of the Ladbrokes owner Entain, the online gaming firm Gamesys and the Betting and Gaming Council (BGC), an industry lobby group. The Labour MP John Spellar’s days out at Lord’s and Euro 2020, funded by the Paddy Power owner Flutter and the BGC, were worth £2,835.80. The Conservative MP Aaron Bell, who used to work for Bet365, went to three Euro 2020 games with Entain, Flutter and Gamesys, accepting tickets worth £6,955.60. Last year he told the Guardian he had “declared all hospitality promptly and transparently”. Another APPG member, Labour’s Conor McGinn, visited Euro 2020 and Wimbledon, at a value of £2,479, with the BGC and Entain. A spokesperson for the Gambling Commission said: “Some sections of the industry are never going to be content with a regulator which continually pushes for safer gambling.” They said the commission would “need time to review [the report’s] contents” and that it had not heard from the APPG before receiving it. “As the industry regulator, we expect to hear from them in an official capacity to respond to views about the Gambling Commission and put straight inaccurate assumptions, as well as share our regulatory approach,” they said. Previous reports by the public accounts committee and the National Audit Office have concluded that the regulator is not tough enough. Matt Zarb-Cousin, the director of the campaign group Clean Up Gambling, said: “It is astonishing that in the middle of a gambling review, industry-friendly MPs want to publish this ludicrous report complaining about regulation. “The growth of online gambling, and the harm associated with it, has increased exponentially under the Gambling Commission’s watch. If anything the operators should be thanking the regulator. What we need is an overhaul of regulation that empowers the Gambling Commission to ensure far more prescriptive rules, more comprehensive oversight of licensees and penalties for non-compliance.” The Guardian has approached the APPG and the MPs who received gambling industry hospitality for comment.",News/Society,MPs criticise UK gambling regulator for trying to reduce addiction,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/23/mps-criticise-uk-gambling-regulator-addiction
