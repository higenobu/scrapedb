1/20/2022,"Police in San Diego have ruled the falling death of a mother and her 2-year-old son at Petco Park in September a homicide-suicide. Raquel Wilkins, 40, and her son Denzel Browning-Wilkins fell six stories to their deaths from a Petco Park concourse prior to a Sept. 25 game between the San Diego Padres and Atlanta Braves. Per the San Diego Union-Tribune, the San Diego Police Department ruled the deaths ""suspicious"" at the time and launched an investigation that concluded that Wilkins intentionally took her own life and her son's with the fall.  “Raquel Wilkins’ death has been classified a suicide and Denzel Browning-Wilkins’ death has been classified a homicide,” SDPD homicide Lt. Andra Brown said, per a statement released on Wednesday.  Per Brown, ""detectives conducted a thorough and comprehensive investigation that included dozens of interviews, reviewing of available video footage, and collecting background information to determine what led to the deaths.” Dan Gilleon, an attorney representing Wilkins' parents and sisters, disputes the police conclusion and accuses San Diego of shirking liability in the deaths at ballpark, which is majority owned by the city (70%) alongside the Padres (30%). “The city of San Diego owns that ballpark, it is legally responsible, assuming that what caused her to fall was anything but her intent,” Gilleon said Wednesday, per the Union Tribune. “The only way the city is not at fault is if she intended to kill herself and her baby.” Gilleon said that he's preparing to file a wrongful death lawsuit against Petco Park and the city of San Diego.

1/20/2022,"Czech folk singer Hana Horká died after deliberately catching COVID-19 from her family, her son said. She wanted to get a health pass so she could visit social and dining areas without being vaccinated. Her son blames anti-vax groups for his mother's trust in natural immunity and subsequent death. A folk singer from the Czech Republic has died after intentionally contracting COVID-19 so she could get a health pass to access sports, entertainment, and dining venues. Hana Horká, 57, a vocalist for folk band Asonance, was unvaccinated and died on Sunday, her son Jan Rek told Czech radio news outlet iRozhlas.cz. He said his mother deliberately caught the coronavirus from him and his father, both of whom contracted COVID over Christmas but had previously received their vaccines. Horká chose not to isolate from her family but to ""live normally"" together, Rek said. ""She decided that she would rather have the disease than be vaccinated,"" Rek said. Horká's aim was to get a recovery pass, a proof of recent infection that allows unvaccinated people to visit venues like bars, pubs, restaurants, cinemas, and sports facilities. Two days before her death, she posted on Facebook that she was recovering from COVID-19 and planned to attend a concert, go to the theater, visit a sauna, and have a swim. Rek said his mother wanted to go for a morning walk, but she felt unwell and rested in bed. Her health declined rapidly, he said, and she died soon after. When asked by iRozhlas.cz if her death was directly caused by COVID-19, he said: ""It doesn't look like anything else."" He blamed anti-vax groups for his mother's death, saying she had ""one hundred percent"" been swayed by celebrities and groups on the internet spreading misinformation about vaccines and the coronavirus. According to iRozhlas.cz, Rek posted an angry comment on social media sarcastically thanking these groups, saying they had ""blood on their hands"" for Horká's death. ""Sadly, she trusted strangers more than her own family,"" he told the radio station. Still, Rek said his mother didn't believe in some of the wilder theories about the vaccines. ""Her philosophy was that she was more okay with the idea of catching COVID than getting vaccinated. Not that we would get microchipped or anything like that,"" he told the BBC. The band webpage for Asonance, one of the Czech Republic's oldest folk groups, has been updated with a tribute to Horká. It says that the beginning of 2022 ""will be shrouded in black forever."" Rek and Asonance did not immediately respond to Insider's requests for comment. The Czech Republic is facing a fresh surge in COVID-19 cases as the country reported its highest ever daily count at 28,469 new infections on Tuesday. Around 62.9% of its 10.7 million population has been fully vaccinated. On Wednesday, the Czech government abandoned its plans to make vaccines mandatory, after thousands gathered in the capital of Prague to protest the decision.

1/20/2022,"Costco has more than 813 warehouses around the world and makes more than $163 billion in sales. The wholesale club has similar customer loyalty as other big box stores, and it adds more new customers than it loses. The average Costco customer is a 39-year-old Asian American woman who's married and earns $125,000, Numerator found. See more stories on Insider's business page. Costco is the fifth-largest retailer in the world, pulling in more than $163 billion in sales last year. The store operates as a wholesale club, with nearly 110 million cardholders representing households and small and midsized businesses. The company has more than 813 warehouse stores around the world, including 562 in the US, and it employs nearly 275,000 people. Roughly one-third of US shoppers are Costco customers, according to data from the analytics firm Numerator prepared for Insider. More than 71% of those who shopped in 2020 visited the store in 2021, per Numerator – roughly on par with other big box retailers, but well behind Walmart's 95% customer loyalty percentage. Costco also added about three new customers for every two that it lost last year, indicating that the brand is expanding its customer base. Numerator found that Costco's typical shopper in the US is an Asian American woman between 35 and 44 years old who is married and living in a city in the Pacific Northwest. (Costco was founded in Seattle and is based in Washington.) She typically has a four-year degree or higher level of education and earns more than $125,000 a year. The typical customer visits Costco on a weekend day every two to three weeks — about 23 trips per year — and picks up nine products for a total cost of about $114 a trip. The company stocks only 4,000 products (stock-keeping units, or SKUs), compared with 30,000 at many other retailers. About 11% of the average Costco shopper's spending is at the wholesale club, similar to what she spends with Amazon, and her top shopping categories in the store are groceries and personal-care items. She also buys a lot of Duracell batteries and Adidas apparel.
