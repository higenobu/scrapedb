3/17/2022,"The boss of John Lewis and the supermarket chain Waitrose has said the UK is facing double-digit inflation as the war in Ukraine exacerbates the soaring cost of living, with prices rising in the supply chain and on shelves. The prediction from Sharon White, chair of the John Lewis Partnership, comes with UK inflation ready at a 30-year high of 5.5%, and expected to rise to almost 8% in April, when household energy bills will soar by hundreds of pounds. “We are seeing inflation we haven’t seen in 30 years,” said White, a Cambridge-educated economist and former second permanent secretary at the Treasury, speaking on the BBC’s Radio 4 Today programme. “Everything you can see in terms of energy prices from the impact of the Ukraine war suggests that we might well end up with double-digit inflation. My big worry is that it ends out being more enduring than anyone expects. So I think inflation is the big macroeconomic washout.” She was also taken to task over John Lewis’s decision to pay all staff a 3% bonus, worth 1.5 weeks pay, after reporting a strong bounce-back in 2021, despite deciding not to repay £58m in tax relief it accepted from the government to weather the worst of the pandemic two years ago. “We kept that relief, that exemption from tax, we used that exactly for the purposes intended, which was to secure jobs and to avoid further restructuring,” she said. “So I make no apologies for paying the bonus to partners who have worked their socks off over the last year.” In 2020, for the first time in 67 years, John Lewis Partnership did not pay staff, which it terms partners, a bonus as the business was forced to close some stores after reporting a £517m loss. “Do I think it was the right thing that we have been able to pay a bonus to partners on the back of results,” she said. “I feel very comfortable morally, absolutely it was the right decision,” White said. She also said the organisation was continuing to look at its supply chain to see whether a ban on the sale of Russian goods in its stores, which it announced earlier this month, could be extended to other products or suppliers. “We have removed Russian vodka from Waitrose shelves and Russian-made pallets that go into outdoor pizza ovens [sold] in John Lewis,” she said. “Anything that is made in Russia is off the shelves. And then, because supply chains are really complicated, we are looking at whether there are other products we need to take off the shelves as well.”",News/Business,"UK facing double-digit inflation, John Lewis head predicts",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/17/uk-facing-double-digit-inflation-john-lewis-head-predicts

3/17/2022,"When voters were asked in February what they thought were the big issues facing Britain, national security did not even make it into the top 10. However, thanks to Vladimir Putin’s attack on Ukraine and his implied threat of nuclear war, the salience of Britain’s military and intelligence security as a political issue has spiked dramatically. After decades of neglect, Westminster now has a keen interest in Britain’s ability to defend itself. The public now think it the most important issue. Boris Johnson hopes to exploit the Ukraine crisis by presenting himself as a sober statesman rather than Downing Street’s premier party animal, but Keir Starmer is better placed to take advantage, and he has sought to do so in two obvious ways. First, to demonstrate Labour’s patriotism to “red wall” voters, he and fellow shadow cabinet ministers have toured Nato countries bordering Russia, cameras in tow. Second, to entrench his power within the party he has isolated those remaining Corbynites still attached to Stop the War. However, the crisis has allowed Starmer to further associate himself with – and expand the meaning of – his favourite word, one that has defined his leadership since its earliest days: security. In his first party conference speech as leader, Starmer talked of wanting to create a Britain “that embodies the values I hold dear. Decency, fairness, opportunity, compassion and security”. But of these five, the most important value was security: “Security for our nation, our families and all of our communities.” In most of his speeches since, the word has reappeared in different contexts and with different partners: in January, Labour’s new, if not especially memorable slogan was unveiled as “Security, Prosperity, Respect”. In Starmer’s much-mocked and certainly over-long Fabian pamphlet, published last autumn, there also lurked his paramount concern for security. In government, he wrote, he wants to create a Britain, “on solid foundations, with security at home, in the workplace, on the streets and from those who would do us harm … I want Labour to once again be Britain’s bricks and mortar – a symbol of solidity, reliability, shelter and the prospect of building something new and better”. If this makes Starmer sound conservative that is deliberate, because if he has any hope of forming a government, Labour needs to win back those retired homeowners in former red wall constituencies who have leaked from Labour over many general elections. Even so, this “security” still requires traditional Labour means, such as government planning and intervention in the economy, increasing opportunities for all with the aim of becoming a fairer and more productive society. Starmer’s promise of “security” frames Labour’s comparatively radical “new deal for working people”, one that will increase the minimum wage, ensure all workers’ entitlement to rights such as parental leave, banning “fire and rehire” practices, and making it easier for employees to be represented by a trade union. For Starmer, then, “security” has long been a key homonym, that is a word with many different meanings and applications, ones the Ukraine crisis has usefully extended into energy policy as well as to a focus on Conservative party funding and Boris Johnson’s friendships with oligarchs who have close links to Putin. Starmer had not even been elected leader before “boring” Starmer had become a soubriquet of choice among journalists. In his first months in post, many commentators quickly dismissed his leadership as an empty space where ideas should be. Certainly, he has not generated the kind of excitement many Labour members felt for Corbyn’s vow to take on capitalism, or the optimism ex-Labour voters saw in Boris Johnson’s “sunlit uplands”. His promise of “security” is also strikingly different to the pitch made to voters by Harold Wilson in 1963, when he said he would unleash the white heat of the technological revolution, or Tony Blair’s 1997 talk of a dazzling New Britain. But does a winning Labour party need such visions? Certainly, while in 1945 Clement Attlee said that Britain needed to face the future, it was a future in which security from ill-health, old age and unemployment was key. Perhaps the “boring” and “risk-averse” Starmer has actually stumbled on a political trope for our uniquely troubled times? He certainly believes he has – and he seems secure in that belief.

3/17/2022,"It is hard to imagine a more timely book than Oliver Bullough’s damning account of Britain’s role in facilitating oligarchs and criminals in their acquisition of billions of pounds’ worth of ill-gotten gains. The UK’s bankers, lawyers and wealth managers have become so reliant on Russia’s dirty money that, in the aftermath of the invasion of Ukraine, it is proving politically and economically painful to cut the umbilical cords channelling cash from Moscow into the City. Bullough characterises this longstanding transactional relationship as that of butler and master: Britain playing Jeeves to Putin’s Bertie Wooster. Butler to the World is both a brilliant and depressing blast at decades of malign financial cosiness and the politicians who let it happen. The rot set in when Britain lost its empire and was forced to cast around for a new part to play on the world stage. It found one by pimping out the City and the Caribbean tax havens that fly the union flag. But in turning a blind eye to the source of trillions of dollars pouring into London’s markets or held off-shore in overseas territories, we have become a nation of fawning servants “at the elbow of the worst people on Earth”. Despite the noises made about values of fair play and the rule of law, few countries do more to frustrate global anti-corruption efforts. Bullough identifies the critical moment in this sad trajectory as the 1956 Suez crisis. In the ensuing financial crash the banking elite that ran the City borrowed barrel loads of dollars to prop up sterling and, by so doing, accidentally invented “one of the most consequential financial tools of the 20th century” – the eurodollar. The banks used the eurodollar to carry on pumping liquidity into the City “without limits or restrictions”, while offering their wealthy clients the choice of having their assets counted in Britain, the US or both – whichever was the most profitable and tax efficient. Bullough shows how this led to the creation of an array of complex financial products, all served from a silver platter of jurisdictions, permitting the super-rich to shelter their fortunes from the prying eyes of governments and regulators. One of the great things about his book is that Bullough doesn’t just sit back and drily condemn all this financial skulduggery, he goes to meet the people who helped create the conditions that allowed it to happen. In the British Virgin Islands, he interviews the English barrister who in 1976 helped turn the islands into a tax haven for American investors. And, in Gibraltar, Bullough tracks down the politicians who drafted the laws that transformed the Mediterranean seaport into a lucrative base for the world’s gambling giants and, more recently, blockchain investors. But it is back in Blighty that Bullough’s investigations will have readers shaking their heads in despair at our unwillingness to stop oligarchs, gangsters and money launderers from milking our systems. He shows how, time and again, wealthy individuals arriving in the UK rely on the same army of professional advisers who help them buy up prime real estate, with the properties registered using a web of offshore shell companies. Generous public donations to universities, arts foundations and political parties bestow a certain kind of British respectability, and grease the way for introductions to members of the royal family and ministers. It takes guts to write and publish a book like this. The crippling legal costs incurred by the publishers of Catherine Belton’s Putin’s People show just how much is at stake. As long as the government allows claimants to take advantage of the eye-watering costs needed to defend a libel action in this country, brave writers such as Belton and Bullough and their publishers will always be financially exposed. There are hundreds of well-known oligarchs who decamped to Britain with their post-Soviet winnings. Many more have simply melted into British society, where they continue to rely on bankers, accountants and lawyers to profit from their exported riches. The Ukraine invasion may well prove to be a pivotal moment in Britain’s willingness to put profits before dirty money. But recent history suggests otherwise: when the west imposed sanctions on Russia after the invasions of Georgia in 2008 and Crimea in 2014, it didn’t take long before normal butlering services were resumed.

3/17/2022,"The E4 European path cuts across Crete, and we did a few sections while backpacking there last October. One of the most scenic sections is from Krios Beach (you can drive here or take a bus from Paleochora town) to the beautiful pink-sanded beach of Elafonisi. Along the way you walk for about 10km across pristine white sand beaches and get to swim in clear turquoise water. You can get a taxi back to Paleochora from Elafonisi. All Trails has a “there and back” walk mostly following the same path, but there are plenty of descriptions of the route online.Rachel Elizabeth Morecambe Bay is one of England’s loveliest beauty spots, and the best way to experience it is with a walk across the sands at low tide. Led by the official guide (first appointed in the 16th century, and essential for safety reasons), the serpentine seven-mile stroll between Arnside and Grange-over-Sands is unique in Britain and absolutely unforgettable, whatever the weather. Costs are typically £15 for adults and £10 for children, which goes entirely to a different charity for each outing. The walk conveniently ends at Kents Bank railway station, for trains back over the bay.Gary The Sheep’s Head Way of West Cork has a wild, at times stark, beauty that its more famous cousin, the Kerry Way, does not. Often grassy and indistinct, this 58-mile circular route traces the coast of the Sheep’s Head peninsula, the slimmest and boniest of the fingers that Ireland juts into the Atlantic at its extreme south-west. Expect kind locals, many sheep and views over the blue of Bantry Bay. The walk, when my mother and I did it in 2016, was lonelier than I expected given its loveliness. Ruined villages and neolithic stone circles came slowly into focus over many miles as we picked our way towards them with bog-dampened feet, past holy wells. We loved it, despite being harassed by horse flies at one point.Phoebe Arslanagic-Wakefield The European long distance hiking route E9 is now complete, with a route along the coast of the Baltic States – Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. The Latvian portion is referred to as Jūrtaka and boasts sandy beaches, green fairytale forests stretching along the coastline, blue skies and the brackish water of the Baltic Sea with its unique freshwater wildlife. And if you’re into beachcombing, the Kurzeme (Courland) coast and Cape Kolka are brilliant places to look for amber.baltictrails.euLaura Vabis Knight We had an unexpectedly beautiful, family-friendly walk on the Isle of Portland. We started at the delightful Quiddles cafe – which advertises itself as serving “seafood that’s off the wall” – at the very end of the esplanade with stunning views looking back along Chesil Beach. Here you are encouraged to borrow a picker and a carrier bag, and collect a bagful of litter from the beach while walking. Setting off along the seawall, heading south towards Blacknor Fort, we soon found ourselves winding along sandy paths, clambering up huge slabs of Portland stone from the Tout Quarry on the cliffs above, and through stunning coastal flora and fauna. Who could ask for a more memorable and dramatic coastline?Johanna Ogden The name Sentiero degli Dei, Path of the Gods, sets up this 8km walk to be something special and it does not disappoint. This stretch of the Amalfi Coast, south of Naples, was once dotted with Roman temples, and strolling along it is celestial in more ways than one. From Bomerano, a hamlet in Agerola, it’s about 10km to Nocelle, near Positano. The path emerges on to craggy clifftops with views of the Med fizzing around the shoreline below and at points there are matchbox multicoloured houses tumbling down the hillsides towards the beaches. At Nocelle you can catch a bus to Positano or walk down more than 1,000 steps to the sea. Our experience was capped off by meeting some strolling monks who offered us a refreshing glass of limoncello – heavenly!Jasmine An ancient gateway, Porth Clais Harbour outside St David’s once served as a transport hub for vital materials (the old harbour wall is thought to have been built by the Romans), today it’s primarily frequented for leisure. My boots are bound for the steady dirt track that quickly opens up to panoramic views of the furthest horizon, and the striking Solva coastline. Muted tones underfoot, I’m suddenly surrounded by verdant yellow scrub, awash with the sound of crashing waves in rocky inlets below, gulls crying above. Transfixed by the ageless beauty of ancient hamlets and home farms of the adjacent countryside, I’m transported in time, my vision flooded, I’ve never felt more alive.Jenna A 16-mile portion of the Fife Coastal Path from North Queensferry to Kinghorn is a surprisingly beautiful walk. Starting under the bold Forth Rail Bridge, the path climbs through woodland to a flat, easygoing path. Industry looms large for part of the walk between Inverkeithing and Dalgety Bay, before passing an old chapel ruin on the way to Aberdour. At Silver Sands beach you can pick up an ice-cream or chips for sustenance. Keep an eye out for seals lazing in the sun on the way to Burntisland and walk along the sand when the tide is out to Kinghorn. It’s an underrated part of Scotland in comparison with the grander cities and scenic Highlands, but has an unassuming charm of its own.Kathryn Black  Guardian Travel readers' tips Every week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

Further on, a Victorian porcelain works half stands in a stony cove, and up steep headland steps waits Edward VII’s Coronation Tower, built in 1902: Wales’ northernmost point. Sit on the pocked concrete and scan the sea for dolphins. At Porth Wen, sunset glows off the chimneys, kilns, and rusted machinery as the harbour walls erode away.Culann Robinson I love the walk from Gokceoren to Saribelen – a 14km-section of Turkey’s amazing Lycian Way (from Fethiye to Antalya). Parts of the path are formed from a Roman aqueduct, and the route passes through pretty pastures and rocky outcrops, with lots of inquisitive goats and a few even-more-inquisitive farmers for company. The beautifully turquoise Med is over your left shoulder for most of the way and you can even see the tiny sloping airport on the Greek island of Kastellorizo from one of the path’s vantage points. End the walk in the tiny village of Saribelen and perhaps reward yourself with an ice-cream or a cold Efes beer.

3/17/2022,"Cineworld made a $708m (£537m) loss last year as Covid closures continued to hurt the world’s second-biggest cinema chain, despite revenues more than doubling led by the latest James Bond and Spider-Man films. The London-listed company, which owns the Cineworld and Picturehouse chains in the UK and Regal in the US, narrowed losses from the record $3bn reported in 2020 as the Covid pandemic threatened its survival. Cineworld reported a more than doubling of revenues from $852m to $1.8bn year-on-year thanks to the easing of Covid restrictions, and hesitancy among film fans receding, as admission numbers jumped 75% from 54m in 2020 to 95.3m in 2021. Daniel Craig’s No Time to Die, his last outing as James Bond, provided the UK and Ireland with its best October, with revenues up 127% on pre-pandemic levels, while globally Cineworld reported revenues at 88% of 2019 levels in December, thanks to the success of Spider-Man: No Way Home. “While our 2021 results still reflect the impacts of Covid-19, particularly at the start of the financial year, we are encouraged by the recent strong trading performance throughout the final quarter,” said Mooky Greidinger, the chief executive of Cineworld. “It is clear that our customers remain loyal and have missed the big screen experience as well as the sociability of watching a movie with others.” However, Cineworld is still burdened with a $4.8bn debt pile, which increased by $493m last year. The company warned there was “uncertainty” about whether it might breach its payment banking covenants in June. Cineworld believes it will be able to make all payments as long as the recovery in admission numbers remains stable and there are “no further lockdowns or operating restrictions in 2022”.",News/Business,Cineworld reports loss despite James Bond and Spider-Man releases,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/17/cineworld-reports-loss-despite-james-bond-and-spider-man-releases
3/17/2022,"The former health secretary Alan Johnson unwittingly ate dog biscuits meant for the Queen’s corgis as he sat next to the monarch during a lunch at Windsor castle in 2008, a new book has revealed. After the meal, Johnson who was also a former Labour home secretary, remarked that he had “particularly enjoyed the cheese and the unusual dark biscuits” laid on by the Queen, according to her latest biographer, Robert Hardman. It was left to his cabinet colleague and fellow royal lunch guest, Paul Murphy, the then Welsh secretary, to reveal to Johnson the truth about what he had eaten. Hardman writes: “Paul said: ‘No, the dark biscuits were for the corgis!’ At that point – to Alan Johnson’s eternal amusement – it dawned on him that he had been munching away on dog snacks. ‘I don’t think I’d had cheese with a Bonio biscuit before’.” Both ministers had attended a privy council meeting before being invited to stay for lunch by the Queen, according to Hardman’s book Queen of Our Times. Johnson and Murphy dined either side of the Queen during the meal. Johnson told Hardman how relaxed the Queen had been during the lunch. The book says: “The informality continued right to the end, as the Queen chatted and fed snacks to her corgis at the same time.” The lunch took place after the verdict of the long-running inquest into the death of Princess Diana, which found she had been unlawfully killed by a combination of the driving by her chauffeur and the vehicles pursuing her, but said there was no evidence of an establishment conspiracy. The ministers decided they would avoid talking about Diana, but the Queen raised it during the lunch, according to Hardman’s book. Johnson told him: “The dominant news was about Diana. Paul and I thought we’d better keep off the subject. But the Queen talked about it in the most frank way.” Hardman also quotes Johnson saying: “At lunch, we had a whale of a time. She was good company. It was as if you’d known her for years. Obviously, there were the caveats that you understood – you don’t put your arm on her shoulder and say, ‘Let me tell you ... ’ and so on.” As a privy counsellor, he said he could not disclose details of the conversation.",News/Politics,"Alan Johnson accidentally ate the Queen’s corgis’ biscuits, book reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/17/alan-johnson-accidentally-ate-the-queens-corgis-biscuits-book-reveals
3/17/2022,"Stretching from Lyme Regis towards Charmouth, East Cliff beach is a hotspot for fossil hunters scouring the shore for spiral-shaped ammonites or the glint of fool’s gold. As the 50-metre-high cliff slowly retreats and collapses into the sea, more rocks containing prehistoric fossils are exposed along Dorset’s Jurassic Coast. But take a closer look and the cliff edge reveals more sinister deposits. Plastic, metal and concrete poke out from the soil and are strewn along the beach. With every storm and tide, smaller items of waste and toxic contaminants are washed out to sea. This cliff marks the edge of an old landfill site called Spittles Lane. Used as a tip until 1978, it contains various metals including lead, asbestos, plastics and chemical contaminants. It is prone to landslides now. In 2008, a 400-metre stretch of cliff collapsed, releasing waste on to the beach below. Scientists at Southampton University expect that the rest of this landfill will be eroded and collapse into the sea within the next century. They estimate that up to 6,000 cubic metres of waste have gone already and that Spittles Lane still contains as much as 42,000 cubic metres more. This landfill, within a Unesco world heritage site, operates under a policy of “no active intervention”, meaning there is no investment against erosion because any potential chemical pollution is considered to be relatively diluted. The council removes big pieces of solid waste, including asbestos, from the beach at regular intervals, but leaves smaller items and any toxic chemicals to be washed away. Historically, choosing coastal locations for landfills was a conscious management decision, says Kate Spencer, professor of environmental geochemistry at Queen Mary University of London. She calculates that in England alone, more than 1,200 out of 20,000 landfills are on the coast. “Older sites weren’t built to isolate pollution from the environment. They were engineered to allow any toxic chemical pollution or sewage to dilute and disperse. It’s how we’ve abused our estuaries and seas for centuries. “Unless we defend them to the hilt, they are at risk of either flooding or erosion,” says Spencer, who has studied coastal landfills for 10 years. This isn’t just a problem in England. “These landfills are a global problem on a geological timescale and now that we’re likely to see significant coastal change or floods, this stuff is much more likely to be released,” says Robert Nicholls, professor of coastal engineering at Southampton University. Across Europe, it is estimated that there are between 350,000 and 500,000 landfills, 90% of which predate modern waste-control legislation requiring landfills to be lined and capped. Significant numbers of these older landfills are in coastal areas or floodplains. In the US, more than 800 coastal “superfund” sites, which store toxic waste and include municipal landfills, are at risk of being flooded in the next two decades as the climate crisis raises sea levels. Landfills in developing countries such as Bangladesh and India are often located on low-lying flood plains. Catastrophic climate events are already triggering large-scale releases of waste. In the US, 13 toxic waste sites in Texas were flooded during Hurricane Harvey in 2017. The failure of the Fox River historic landfill in New Zealand during a storm in 2019 polluted approximately 60 miles (100km) of coastline. “We need to focus on adaptation all around our coastline because sea-level rise and coastal erosion are inevitable,” says Spencer. One option is to let nature take its course as the coast erodes and landfills crumble into the sea. But, depending on the location and site contents, this could be risky to human health and marine life. Another is to build substantial coastal defences to protect the landfill and stabilise the slopes, but this is complex, expensive and not always possible if the coastline is protected by conservation status. Coastal landfills could be excavated and moved to a more secure facility inland, but costs are likely to be prohibitive. Alternatively, some form of on-site processing could remove the most toxic elements, but to do this, more needs to be known about which materials and components are most hazardous. Spencer and Nicholls believe that landfills can be seen as a resource by extracting valuable precious metals, such as lithium and iron, or plastics that could be reused or recycled. Landfill mining could raise enough funds to deal effectively with remaining contaminants, says Spencer, but there is debate about whether the economics could ever stack up. It is not feasible to clean up every single site, said Nicholls. The best way to manage coastal landfills globally, he says, is to create an evidence-based system to rank them according to the level of risk. “A lot of material in landfills probably isn’t terribly harmful once in the sea, but some really is. We don’t have a methodology to make that rational decision and we need to tackle the worst ones first,” he says. Figuring out what chemicals are in landfills will also improve understanding of the potential damage they are causing and who is liable for that damage, says Spencer. “As with any pollution, identifying the source is challenging, especially when multiple diffuse sources exist, but until you do that, no one will take responsibility and pay to fix it,” she says. Nicholls hopes that developing the tools to carry out better assessments of coastal landfills in the UK will have far-reaching consequences. “We could help solve our problems and then export what we learn and help solve the world’s problems,” he says, “because this issue is universal.”",News/Environment,Toxic waste revealed as eroding coastlines expose old landfills,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/17/toxic-waste-revealed-as-eroding-coastlines-expose-old-landfills
