1/3/2022,"Michelle Li, a Korean American news anchor in St. Louis, drew shock nationwide this weekend, after sharing a voicemail from a viewer in which the woman complains that Li was “being very Asian” during her broadcast on New Year’s Day. “This evening, your Asian anchor mentioned something about being Asian, and Asian people eat dumplings on New Year’s Day and [I] kind of take offense to that,” the woman starts out. “Because what if one of your White anchors said, ‘Well, white people eat this on New Year’s Day?'” She continued: “I don’t think it was appropriate that she said that and, she was being very Asian and…I don’t know. She can keep her Korean to herself, alright? Sorry, was annoying.” Li posted a video of herself listening to the message, which you can hear in full in the video below. Li did not react in a large way but simply sipped her drink as she listened. The viewer also asserted that if a white person had said something similar, they would be fired. Li did note on Twitter that she would “love to say something back.” On Instagram, she bit back a little harder, though, joking in the caption that “We should all be given the chance to bring our full humanity to the table.” Li has since changed both her Twitter and Instagram bios to read “VERY ASIAN.”",U.S./The Wrap,Korean American News Anchor Michelle Li Criticized by Viewer for ‘Being Very Asian’ On Air,https://news.yahoo.com/korean-american-news-anchor-michelle-222911673.html
1/3/2022,"Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) is open to reengaging on the climate and child care provisions in President Biden's Build Back Better agenda if the White House removes the enhanced child tax credit from the $1.75 trillion package — or dramatically lowers the income caps for eligible families, people familiar with the matter tell Axios. Why it matters: The holdback senator's engagement on specifics indicates negotiations between him and the White House could get back on track, even after Manchin declared he was a “no” on the package on Dec. 19. Stay on top of the latest market trends and economic insights with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free The senator’s concerns with the size and the scope of the package remain. His belief that it could cost more than $4 trillion over 10 years extends beyond the CTC issue, and he continues to tell colleagues he’s concerned about the inflationary effects of so much government spending, Axios is told. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its next Consumer Price Index on Jan. 12. Last month's reading put inflation at 6.8% for the year — fueling Manchin's opposition. The big picture: Manchin and top White House aides traded recriminations after their negotiations fell apart — but President Biden and the senator subsequently spoke by phone late in the evening of Dec. 19. They agreed to continue to talk, and Manchin stayed in touch with senior White House officials over the holidays. The week before Christmas, reports emerged about how close he and Biden were on a potential deal. The details included a $1.8 trillion offer from Manchin that contained money for universal preschool and green tax credits but nothing for the child tax credit, which provides families up to $3,600 per child per year. Families who make up to $400,000 had been receiving some CTC payments under the program that ended Jan. 1. Between the lines: One possible solution to the stalemate would be to remove the CTC from the Build Back Better legislation, which the Senate plans to pass with only Democratic votes. The chamber could then have a separate, focused debate during a midterm year about making the tax credits permanent. Some Republicans, like Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), are supportive of the CTC, but it’s unclear if Democrats could find all 10 Republicans needed to clear the 60-vote threshold for passing major legislation.

1/3/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Investigators located the ignition point of the devastating Boulder County, Colorado, wildfire that engulfed more than 1,000 buildings in drought-parched grasslands at the base of the Rocky Mountains, and the governor of the state underscored heightened risks posed by climate change.

The location is near the intersection of a state highway where a wooden shed was photographed ablaze Thursday, Pelle said, noting his office executed a search warrant but “it is an open and active investigation.” The 6,215-acre wind-whipped blaze that destroyed 991 buildings, damaged more than 100 others and left two people missing and presumed dead. A third person reported missing was located alive, Pelle said. Investigators initially suspected downed power lines caused the blaze, however, Xcel Energy Inc. -- the electric provider in the area -- found no evidence. Burned-out residents face a long haul toward rebuilding given “shortages of supplies and labor,” Governor Jared Polis said. Deanne Criswell, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, toured the fire zone Sunday, anticipating “a long road to recovery.” Boulder County’s disaster is the latest triggered by extreme weather as climate change and a La Nina weather pattern leave much of the West in drought. “This was a horrific convergence of two things,” Polis said. “We had an unusually dry and warm winter” and “historic wind gusts.” Snow Relief Relief arrived in the aftermath of the inferno in the form of a foot of snow, which aided firefighters. “We know that with the climate we face higher risks,” the governor said. “It’s a challenging issue across the American West.” The wildfire mitigation plan for the area, 30 miles (48 kilometers) northwest of Denver, hadn’t been updated since 2010, predating a 17% increase in the local population, the Denver Gazette reported Sunday. The communities of Louisville and Superior suffered the greatest losses and Louisville police deployed cadaver dogs as a precaution although there were no reports of missing people in the burned out city.
