5/4/2022,"Just Eat Takeaway is facing boardroom turmoil after a senior executive stepped down amid an investigation by the courier group into a formal complaint regarding misconduct at a company event. The board of Just Eat said it would not be putting Jörg Gerbig, its chief operating officer, forward for re-election at the company’s annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, as it was set to engage an “external expert” to conduct an investigation into “possible personal misconduct”. The group’s chairman, Adriaan Nühn, also announced plans to stand down shortly before the group’s annual shareholder meeting, as the delivery firm faces anger from shareholders over a botched takeover deal and heavy losses. The company said an investigation into the complaint against Gerbig, which it said was “not related to financial or reporting obligations”, was already in an initial stage and no conclusions had been drawn. Just Eat said the confidential nature of its policy for whistleblowers and “the requirement for a thorough process, recognising the privacy and interests of all involved” meant “no additional information can be provided at this time”. Gerbig is fully cooperating with the investigation and has informed Just Eat’s board that he has “full confidence in the outcome”. He will cease to be a member of the group’s management board from the close of the group’s annual meeting on Wednesday, and Just Eat said it would provide a further update on the investigation “if and when appropriate”. Nühn also unexpectedly announced plans to stand down as he admitted “it is clear that shareholders have concerns about the challenges the company is facing”. Just Eat is facing a shareholder revolt at its annual meeting after revealing declining orders and plans to sell off all or part of its US-based Grubhub arm, which it bought for $7.3bn in a deal agreed less than two years ago and completed last year. The company recently revealed a pre-tax loss of more than €1.1bn (£916m) for 2021 although it said it was “rapidly progressing towards profitability”. Just Eat’s second largest shareholder, the US fund Cat Rock, has called for a shake-up of the company’s board saying there had been a “complete loss of trust” by investors as the value of their shares has dived by about 75% in two years. In an open letter to other shareholders, Cat Rock called for them to block the re-election of Just Eat’s chief finance officer and replace its supervisory board to “restore credibility with the capital markets” and “quickly refocus the business on Europe”.",News/Business,Just Eat senior executive Jörg Gerbig quits amid misconduct investigation,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/04/just-eat-senior-executive-jorg-gerbig-quits-amid-misconduct-investigation

5/4/2022,"“One of the greatest combinations of pasta and fish,” according to (the also great) Anna del Conte, the flavours of this Sicilian speciality reflect the turbulent history of Italy’s south. In her book Two Kitchens, Rachel Roddy tells the story of the ninth-century Byzantine commander Euphemism of Messina who, feeling peckish after landing near Marsala, tasked his cooks with making dinner from what they could find to eat there. “The hillside provided them with wild fennel, raisins and pine nuts, the sea with fish … a pleasing legend,” Roddy concludes, “which, whether true or not, ties the dish to a place and time, and reminds us of the riches that once thrived – and still thrive – in Sicily.” The use of fruit and saffron suggests the culinary influence of the north Africans who displaced the Byzantines, but whoever’s responsible, they should be thanked for a flavour combination that Elizabeth David records as “discordant but exciting” – the perfect description for this deeply aromatic dish. As the name implies, this dish is made with sardines, which is helpful, because we get such good ones in the UK in summer. Given their silvery beauty, I can see why both Alan Davidson, author of the magisterial Mediterranean Seafood, and del Conte choose to use some whole fish as a garnish, but seeing as they just end up mixed into the rest, unless you’re really looking to impress, I wouldn’t bother. (If you are, set aside one sardine per person, remove the head and spine, and fry in a very little oil until lightly golden on both sides.) That said, I don’t think you need to cut them up very small, either, as Davidson does with the remainder; most will break up in the pan anyway, but it’s nice to have some larger chunks in there to remind you what you’re eating. Though she calls for fresh fish, Marcella Hazan laments in her Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking that, due to its “rare and unpredictable” supply, this “may have to be replaced by canned sardines”. I try this with sardines in olive oil, and the slightly salty, deliciously oily fish collapses so obligingly into the sauce that I almost prefer it, so they’re a great option if you can’t get hold of fresh fish. Though less visible in the final dish, anchovies are almost as important for the intensely savoury quality they lend the dish, which, thanks to the dried fruit and aniseedy fennel, risks being rather sweet otherwise. Hazan cooks them above a pan of simmering water, and Davidson does so off the heat, but if you buy the kind packed in oil, rather than salt, they should melt happily into the rest without any such cosseting. Or, strictly speaking, fennel tops. As Roddy’s tale makes clear, this is traditionally made with wild fennel, a far hardier and more pungent affair than the stuff cultivated for its pallid bulbs. She relates seeing people gathering it on the riverbank near her home in Rome, and happily it’s also a common wild plant in most of England, and on coasts elsewhere in the UK; it’s said to have been introduced by the Romans – in fact, one website informs me it thrives to such an extent that it’s often considered “a pest”, clearly by people who’ve never tried pasta con le sarde. There’s a healthy amount growing by the canal near me in north London, but if you can’t find any, or cultivated fennel with the fronds intact (farmers’ markets tend to be a better source than greengrocers or supermarkets), I wouldn’t bother using the bulb instead, as many recipes suggest, because it lacks the same intensity of flavour, and simply gets lost among all the other ingredients. A better idea is to stick in what fronds you can find, and then, like del Conte, add fennel seeds as well – you certainly can’t miss them. If you can’t find either, Stefano Arturi of the Italian Home Cooking blog tells me he substitutes dill, adding it raw at the very end. “In traditional recipes, the wild fennel is boiled to eliminate some of the bitterness,” Roddy explains, though the 20 minutes recommended by the Silver Spoon feels excessive. It’s hard to be too prescriptive, given that everyone’s fennel will be different, but while I don’t think cultivated fennel tops, unless they’re particularly sturdy of stem, require even the briefest blanching before use, the five-minute boil in Nonna Fina’s recipe, collected in Anastasia Miari and Iska Lupton’s Grand Dishes, feels sufficient for the young, wild fennel greens I find. Adjust as necessary. Alliums (I like Davidson and Nonna Fina’s shallots, but onion would be fine) give the dish an earthy sweetness, while dried vine fruits (I favour the diminutive currant) bring little pops of pure sugar; soak them before use, so they’re juicy, rather than chewy – like the crunchy, toasted pine nuts, they yield as much textural interest as flavour. Davidson and Hazan also use saffron, which gives the dish a touch of glamour, but this is very much optional. Roddy deploys homemade tomato sauce in her recipe, while Nonna Fina and Hazan both go for tomato puree, with the former also adding white wine and a pinch of sugar. Davidson and del Conte leave out the tomato altogether, though, which is also my own preference (as well as, according to several correspondents, the Palermo way of doing things), because I think it allows the sardines to shine, but if you’d prefer a wetter dish, dissolve a couple of tablespoons of puree in a little of the fennel cooking water and add it to the pan while cooking the sardines. This is one place where I would sanction the use of bucatini, the long, hollow strands that I generally find rather frustrating to eat in saucier contexts. Del Conte mentions rigatoni or penne, Roddy adds casarecce to the list, and Nonna Fina, though a fan of bucatini – “the hole running through the middle is perfect for catching the sauce” – allows that readers may pick whichever kind they prefer. Whatever you choose, cook it in the same water you used for the fennel tops – not only is this a good way to conserve both water and energy, but it ties the whole dish together. Del Conte and Davidson both finish their pasta off in the oven, though the latter notes that “this is the practice at Trapani”, suggesting that in Palermo this stage would be omitted. I don’t care for it myself: it risks overcooking the delicate fish, and makes the dish as a whole rather dry and stodgy. Instead, I’d finish it with a good sprinkling of breadcrumbs – “a typical poor man’s substitute for grated parmesan”, as Genaro Contaldo puts it – and perhaps a lemon on the side, as Nonna Fina recommends, for people to add if desired. Buon appetito!

In a separate dish, soak the saffron with a tablespoon of warm water. Toast the pine nuts in a dry pan and set aside, then toast the breadcrumbs in the same pan with a good dash of olive oil and salt, until golden, and set those aside, too. Grind the fennel seeds, if using. Remove the heads from the sardines, carefully pull out their backbones and tails (watch a video online if you’re not sure how to do this), then roughly chop the flesh. Bring a large pan of salted water to a boil and add the fennel tops. If you’re using cultivated fennel, scoop out with a slotted spoon after 30 seconds, and drain; if using wild, simmer for about five minutes before scooping out. Cover the pan to keep the water warm for the pasta. Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat, and fry the shallots until soft but not coloured. Add the anchovies, cook, stirring, until they’ve melted into the shallots, then turn up the heat slightly and add the ground fennel and sardine chunks. Fry for a couple of minutes, then add the drained raisins, the saffron and its soaking water, and a spoonful of the fennel cooking water, and cook for five minutes more, adding more water if the mix becomes too dry. Meanwhile, bring the fennel water back to a boil, and cook the pasta to your taste. Add the fennel tops to the frying pan, then toss through the drained pasta, pine nuts and breadcrumbs, keeping a few breadcrumbs back to sprinkle over the finished dish, and serve with a lemon wedge on the side, if desired.

5/4/2022,"An influential thinktank that has led the backlash against the government’s net zero policy has received funding from groups with oil and gas interests, according to tax documents seen by the Guardian and OpenDemocracy. Though the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) has always said it is independent of the fossil fuel industry, the revelations about its funding will raise questions over its campaigning. The thinktank has always refused to disclose its donors, but tax documents filed with US authorities reveal that one of its donors has $30m (£24m) of shares in 22 companies working in coal, oil and gas. Over four years the GWPF’s US arm, the American Friends of the GWPF, received more than $1m from US donors. The vast majority of this, $864,884, was channelled to the UK group, with some being held back for expenses. Of the £1.45m the GWPF has received in charitable donations since 2017, about 45% has come from the US. It received $210,525 in 2018 and 2020 from the Sarah Scaife Foundation – set up by the billionaire libertarian heir to an oil and banking dynasty. The US-based foundation has $30m-worth of shares in 22 energy companies including $9m in Exxon and $5.7m in Chevron, according to its financial filings. Between 2016 and 2020, the American Friends of the GWPF received $620,259 from the Donors Trust, which is funded by the Koch brothers, who inherited their father’s oil empire and have spent hundreds of millions of dollars funding the climate denial movement. “It is disturbing that the Global Warming Policy Foundation is acting as a channel through which American ideological groups are trying to interfere in British democracy,” said Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the LSE Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment. The GWPF was set up by Lord Lawson, a former Conservative chancellor, in 2009, to challenge the “costs and implications” of measures to tackle climate change. Since then, it has gained prominence in UK politics, counting Conservative MPs and peers as supporters and trustees. Craig Mackinlay, who runs the Net Zero Scrutiny Group (NZSG), a committee of about 20 parliamentarians, has supported the GWPF in its campaigning and two advisers to the GWPF were recently hired by Mackinlay’s parliamentary office as researchers. The NZSG says it does not question climate science, but exists to question the costs of reaching net zero. Steve Baker, the Wycombe MP who has led much of the criticism towards the government’s net zero policies, is a trustee of the GWPF and vocally supports the group, recently sharing a report by the thinktank that denied the climate emergency exists. He is a prominent member of the NZSG, and has recently campaigned for fracking, inviting the shale gas industry to speak to MPs and members of the rightwing press in parliament. After campaigning from the NZSG, the government recently declared that fracking companies would be allowed to continue their research in the UK. Shale gas wells that were supposed to be filled in with concrete this summer have been given a new lease of life, after campaigning from Baker, Mackinlay and others associated with the NZSG. There are fears that the UK’s net zero ambitions could be watered down with further campaigning from MPs on the right of the party. The Guardian has asked Baker and Mackinlay whether they would reconsider their connections to the GWPF in light of the news about the thinktank’s funding. Mackinlay said: “Do look at my staff declarations of interests as properly recorded in the parliamentary register; all totally transparent and for the world to see. Make of it whatever you wish.” Baker said the allegations “appear to be ridiculous”, adding: “It is an extraordinary fact that the same newspapers and commentators who would usually be the first to protest any kind of poverty are wasting the public’s time with these attempts to distract from the real issues at hand. It would be better if the political world focused their attention on how our current energy strategy has driven up energy prices and contributed to the terrible cost-of-living crisis that so many are experiencing.” The funding has caused fears that the culture wars over climate denial in the US could be being imported to UK politics, and funded by billionaires with links to “big oil”. Ed Miliband, the shadow climate secretary, said: “US rightwing groups with links to big oil are desperate to stop action against the climate crisis. Now they are trying to extend their reach into UK political debate. “Opposing action on the climate emergency will drive up bills for consumers because green power is now cheaper, cleaner, and quicker than fossil fuels.” Already the rumblings of a culture war have begun, with the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage calling for a referendum on net zero, and Baker, a vital figure in the Brexit campaign, declaring he wanted to “do for net zero what [he] did for Brexit”. A spokesperson for the GWPF said: “We do not accept donations from anyone with an interest in an energy company. We turn down many offers of funding from people with vested interests. I am not sure this is true of any group on the other side of the debate. “Donor’s Trust is a middleman, matching donors to those seeking funding. Disbursements are not made from a homogenous pool of money – recipients of funds know the identity of the original donors. We are therefore able to vet them in line with our funding policy. “I suggest you also consider what constitutes an ‘interest’. Money that is inherited does not create an ‘interest’, let alone a vested one. The wealth that ultimately created the Scaife Foundation was created at the end of the 19th century and the start of the 20th. It would be ludicrous to suggest that three generations on, it represents an oil company interest.” Adam Bychawski is a reporter for OpenDemocracy",News/Environment,Climate sceptic thinktank received funding from fossil fuel interests ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/04/climate-sceptic-thinktank-received-funding-from-fossil-fuel-interests
5/4/2022,"Thieves have destroyed a statue of a Native American ballerina and sold the broken parts to a recycling center in Oklahoma for about $250. Last week, thieves chopped the statue of Marjorie Tallchief into pieces, prompting outcry among residents in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Tallchief was an American ballerina, primarily in the 1940s and 50s, and a member of the Osage Nation. The sister of Maria Tallchief, considered the United States’s first major prima ballerina, Marjorie was the first Native American to be named the “première danseuse étoile” or the leading dancer by the Paris Opera Ballet. The statue belonged to the Tulsa Historical Society and Museum and until last week, was perched outside the museum’s west lawn for 15 years. In an announcement made on Monday, the museum said that the statue “has been partially found, cut into pieces, at a recycling center. We are devastated but hopeful for apprehension and more answers to come.” The museum urged the public to continue sending tips to the Tulsa police department, which is currently investigating the matter. In a separate GoFundMe page, museum officials have launched a $15,000 online fundraiser to cover the statue’s insurance deductible and costs for additional security for other statues outside the museum. Tallchief’s statue is one of the museum’s “Five Moons” – bronze statues of five of Oklahoma’s renowned Native American ballerinas that include Yvonne Chouteau, Rosella Hightower, Moscelyne Larkin and Maria Tallchief. The sculptures were designed by two local artists, Monte England and Gary Henson. England worked on two of the sculptures before he died in 2005. After England’s death, Henson took over and completed the remainder of the project. When the statues were unveiled in 2019, Sharon Terry, who was then the director of the Tulsa Historical Society, said, “These women made such an extraordinary impact on history.” “It’s been said many times before but it’s still just as true – the world of ballet was exclusively European until these five Indian women, all from small Oklahoma towns, came along. They truly made a place for Americans in the world of ballet,” she added. Henson said that sculpting the statues allowed him the “opportunity to express my own appreciation for ballet. It’s a way of looking at the human condition. Here are these five American Indian women who are able to do amazing things – to move in ways that most of us can only dream about – and who were able to succeed once they got their chance.” In an announcement released on Tuesday, the museum said that Henson had agreed to replace the statue without an existing mold.“I can do this!” he said.",News/US news,Statue of Native American ballerina destroyed and sold to recycling center,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/04/statue-native-american-ballerina-destroyed
5/4/2022,"Tony Brooks was taking a weekend off from the final year of his dental studies in Manchester when, in October 1955, he became the first British driver to win a postwar grand prix in a British car. The Gran Premio di Siracusa was not a world championship race, and the field was not of the highest quality, but to beat the Italian teams – and particularly the mighty Maseratis – on their home ground with his humble Connaught was a noteworthy feat, particularly since he had never taken the wheel of a Formula One car before the previous day’s practice session. Brooks, who has died aged 90, was as surprised as anyone by the result he achieved on the Sicilian roads, but it led to a distinguished career at the top level. He went on to win six world championship grands prix – and in 1959, while driving for the team of Enzo Ferrari, he came close to capturing the drivers’ championship itself. That he did not win it – and was widely criticised in Italy as a result – came about through circumspection. He had travelled to the last race of the season, the US Grand Prix at Sebring, in contention for the title with Jack Brabham and Stirling Moss. To see off Brabham, Brooks needed to win and take the extra point awarded for the fastest lap, with the Australian finishing no higher than third. To beat Moss, he needed to win with his fellow Englishman no higher than second and without taking the extra point. On the first lap of the race, however, Brooks was accidentally rammed in the rear by his young teammate Wolfgang von Trips, triggering a promise to himself – following two big accidents earlier in his career caused by mechanical problems – never again to compete in a potentially dangerous machine. Now, fearing that his rear suspension had been damaged in the collision, he called in at the pits and asked his mechanics to investigate. Their examination revealed nothing amiss and he was able to resume, but could finish only third, leaving Brabham to take the title. Enzo Ferrari was not best pleased. Brooks was an extremely fast and polished driver who may have acquired prudence but lacked nothing in courage. He particularly enjoyed the challenge of the road circuits, then still in widespread use, with their natural hazards and almost complete lack of safety precautions, but had no trouble defending his refusal to take additional risks with suspect machinery. “I survived the dangerous 50s when far too many of my racing colleagues did not,” he pointed out, adding that all his biggest wins had come after he adopted that approach. He was born in Dukinfield, Cheshire, the son of a dentist, Charles Brooks, and his wife, Irene, who both liked fast cars. Educated as a boarder at the Jesuit-run Barlborough Hall and Mount St Mary’s college in Derbyshire, where he distinguished himself on the rugby field, he enrolled in 1950 at the Manchester University dental school. Two years later, just after his 20th birthday, he competed for the first time in his mother’s Healey Silverstone sports car, finishing fifth in a five-lap race at Goodwood. For 1953 he switched to a much faster Frazer Nash owned by a family friend. Throughout that year and the following season he made a good impression, and in September 1954 he was invited to drive a factory-entered Frazer Nash of a more modern type in the Tourist Trophy at Dundrod, in Co Antrim, his first overseas event. A few weeks later he was asked by John Wyer, Aston Martin’s team manager, to take part in a series of tests at an Oxfordshire airfield, leading to an invitation to join them for 1955. Accepting the offer of a £50 retainer and a share of the prize money and other bonuses, he made his debut with the team at Le Mans, co-driving with John Riseley-Prichard, an insurance broker, in the 24-hour race. When Pierre Levegh’s Mercedes crashed into the crowd in front of the main grandstand, killing 81 spectators and the driver, Brooks was only a few seconds behind and had to brake hard before picking his way through the wreckage strewn across the track. Several good placings at the wheel of Riseley-Prichard’s Formula Two Connaught led to the offer of the works entry in the grand prix car at Syracuse. The result put Brooks’s name in the headlines, although it could not save the little Surrey-based team from eventual bankruptcy. An offer from the BRM team for 1956 looked promising, but the car’s mechanical unreliability reached a nadir when the throttle stuck open during the British Grand Prix at Silverstone. He was thrown out as the car somersaulted; had he been restrained by modern seat belts, he would probably have died when the petrol tank exploded as the car came to rest upside down. A few days before the accident, during a sports car meeting in Rouen, he had met Pina Resegotti, an elegant young woman from Pavia, near Milan, who was on the way to London as part of the study course for her doctorate in foreign languages. Their relationship deepened as he worked his way through a copy of Teach Yourself Italian in order to converse with her family, and they married in 1958. Brooks had continued his formal dentistry studies and received his degree in December 1956, by which time he had left BRM to join the Vanwall team, owned by the millionaire ball-bearing manufacturer Tony Vandervell, his basic retainer leaping to £2,000 a year. At Aintree in the summer of 1957 he and Moss made history when they shared the first world championship victory for a British car, the triumph coming while he was still recovering from cuts and bruises suffered at Le Mans a month earlier when the gearbox of his Aston Martin stuck and the car finished on its back in a sandbank. Knowing that he would not be strong enough to complete the full distance, he agreed to keep the car as high up the order as possible in case one of his teammates retired and could take it over, as the rules then allowed. When Moss’s Vanwall began to misfire, they swapped cars and Moss drove Brooks’s healthy machine on to a famous victory. Moss was the team’s No 1 driver, with the right to pick the best equipment, and he went on to victories at Pescara and Monza that year, while Brooks had to be content with a win for Aston Martin in the Nürburgring 1000km, co-driving with Noel Cunningham-Reid. In 1958, however, he scored grand prix victories at Spa, the Nürburgring and Monza, three classic circuits that provided a driver with great challenges, matching Moss’s victories at Buenos Aires, Oporto and Casablanca. Both Vanwall drivers were beaten to the title by their compatriot Mike Hawthorn, who accumulated more points despite guiding his Ferrari to only a single victory. The Scuderia Ferrari would be Brooks’s next stop, with mixed results, although wins at Reims and the banked AVUS track in Berlin enabled him to finish the 1959 season in second place in the drivers’ standings. He considered retirement when Pina gave birth to the first of their children that autumn but continued for two more years, the first in a Cooper-Climax entered by the Yeoman Credit team and the second in a BRM. The results were almost uniformly disappointing, although he finished the last race of his career, the 1961 US Grand Prix at Watkins Glen, New York, in third place behind Innes Ireland’s Lotus and Dan Gurney’s Porsche. In 1959 he had invested some of his earnings in a petrol station. Over the years, as his family grew up in St George’s Hill, Weybridge, Surrey, he expanded the business into a successful dealership, first for Austin and Rover cars, then Lancia and Fiat, and finally Ford, before selling the firm and retiring in 1993. He had maintained his interest in the sport, spending 10 years as the motoring correspondent of the Observer. In 2008 he was honoured by a special tribute at the Goodwood Revival meeting, at which he returned to the cockpit of a Vanwall, wearing his familiar brown Herbert Johnson crash helmet. A man of quiet dignity, courtesy and understated elegance, he was particularly admired by those who knew how close he had come to achieving immortality and recognised the grace with which he accepted that frustration. His ample consolation was a life with Pina and their children, Caroline, David, Michèle, Julia and Stephanie.

5/4/2022,"For more than two centuries, residents of a remote Canadian island in the north Atlantic knew they could count on a nearby doctor for relief of most ailments. But this June, Fogo Island will lose the community’s only full-time physician, a trend mirrored in many of Newfoundland’s towns and villages as the region battles economic decline and a looming demographic crisis. The closest doctor will be a six-hour ferry ride away, subject to the vagaries of powerful maritime storms. “When you consider it’s the first time since 1792 that they’ve been without a resident doctor, it leaves you gobsmacked and really hits home that there’s something bigger happening,” said Paddy Daly, host of the popular Newfoundland-based radio show Open Line. “This is something that’s been a long time coming. This didn’t happen overnight.” Ever since its cod fishery collapsed in the early 1990s, the province of Newfoundland and Labrador has struggled to regain economic momentum. But the province is also battling a demographic crisis, with deaths outnumbering births and an exodus of residents. In the recent national census, Newfoundland and Labrador was the only province in the country to see its population drop since 2016 and has struggled to retain the immigrants that arrive in the region. Among the hardest hit by the exodus were the smallest settlements, known as outport communities. The lack of doctors has become emblematic of this plight, even inspiring the 2013 Canadian comedy The Grand Seduction. In a the film, the villagers of Tickle Head work hard to lure a doctor to settle in the community by putting on fake games of cricket and leaving money at the wharf. After their physician left in 2021, residents of another outpost, Bell Island, tried to take matters into their own hands, launching the Bell Island Grand Seduction Facebook page, pleading with the region’s health authority to send Dr Firas Ayar back to the community. “We do not want to trick, charm or hoodwink Dr Ayar into returning to Bell Island. We want this platform to be used to show him our love and respect and our desire to have him back in our community,” wrote resident Kenneth Kavanagh. The group eked out a small victory when Ayar returned on a short-term contract. But the broader trajectory of the region suggests these small wins will be rare – especially in communities with dwindling economic prospects. “In a lot of these places, likely gone are the days when you had a family doctor who knew you and your children and their children,” said Daly. “And so people will have to think about whether they move to be closer to care, or whether they stay.” Nearly 100,000 Newfoundlanders lack access to a family physician and Fogo Island’s recent loss of a doctor highlights the complicated realities of managing a shortage of healthcare professionals. Island resident Sabrina Payne recently decided to sell her home and leave the islandafter long ferry trips to the mainland became too much when she was receiving cancer treatment. “It took me a long time to make the decision, because I really loved the place,” she told CBC. “But ultimately my mental health was declining because it was – everything was a chore.” The community, is home to one of Canada’s most expensive and famous hotels, whose guests have included the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and Gwyneth Paltrow. The Fogo Island Inn, where the cheapest stay exceeds US$6,000 – is also one of the biggest employers in the community. Shorefast, the company that runs the hotel, is a registered charity that says it invests all of its profits back into the community. Daly suggested Fogo might be one of the few places with the resources and influence to successfully lobby the region’s health authority. “In Fogo’s case, it might be that Shorefast plays a role in helping the community secure a doctor,” said Daly. “Because increasingly it looks as though the places will try to take matters into their own hands.”",News/World news,"For the first time in 200 years, people on this Canadian island will be without a doctor",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/04/fogo-island-canada-no-doctor

April was one of those months, with two major new releases in the field stunning onlookers. The first was Google’s PaLM, a new language model (the same basic type of AI as the famous GPT series) that shows a pretty stunning ability to comprehend and parse complex statements – and explain what it’s doing in the process. Take this simple comprehension question from the company’s announcement: Prompt: Which of the following sentences makes more sense? 1. I studied hard because I got an A on the test. 2. I got an A on the test because I studied hard. Model Response: I got an A on the test because I studied hard. Or this: Prompt: Q: A president rides a horse. What would have happened if the president had ridden a motorcycle? 1. She or he would have enjoyed riding the horse. 2. They would have jumped a garden fence. 3. She or he would have been faster. 4. The horse would have died. Model Response: She or he would have been faster. These are the sorts of questions that computers have historically struggled with, that require a fairly broad understanding of basic facts about the world before you can begin tackling the statement in front of you. (For another example, try parsing the famous sentence “time flies like an arrow, fruit flies like a banana”). So poor Google that, less than a week later, its undeniable achievements with PaLM were overshadowed by a far more photogenic release from OpenAI, the formerly Musk-backed research lab that spawned GPT and its successors. The lab showed off Dall-E 2 (as in, a hybrid of Wall-E and Dalí), an image generation AI with the ability to take text descriptions in natural language and spit out alarmingly detailed images. A picture is worth a thousand words, so here’s a short book about Dall-E 2, with the pictures accompanied by the captions that generated them. From the official announcement, “An astronaut playing basketball with cats in space in a watercolor style”: And “A bowl of soup as a planet in the universe as a 1960s poster”: From the academic paper going into detail about how Dall-E 2 works, “a shiba inu wearing a beret and black turtleneck”: And “a teddy bear on a skateboard in times square”: Not all the prompts have to be in conversational English, and throwing in a bunch of keywords can help tune what the system does. In this case, “artstation” is the name of an illustration social network, and Dall-E is effectively being told “make these images as you’d expect to see them on artstation”. And so: “panda mad scientist mixing sparkling chemicals, artstation” “a dolphin in an astronaut suit on saturn, artstation” The system can do more than simple generation, though. It can produce variations on a theme, effectively by looking at an image, describing it itself, and then creating more images based on that description. Here’s what it gets from Dalí’s famous The Persistence of Memory, for instance: And it can create images that are a blend of two, in a similar way. Here’s Starry Night merging with two dogs: It can also use one image as an anchor and then modify it with a text description. Here we see a “photo of a cat” becoming “an anime drawing of a super saiyan cat, artstation”: These images are all, of course, cherrypicked. They are the best, most compelling examples of what the AI can produce. OpenAI has not, despite its name, opened up access to Dall-E 2 to all, but it has allowed a few people to play with the model, and is taking applications for a waiting list in the meantime. Dave Orr, a Google AI staffer, is one lucky winner, and published a critical assessment: “One thing to be aware of when you see amazing pictures that DE2 generates, is that there is some cherrypicking going on. It often takes a few prompts to find something awesome, so you might have looked at dozens of images or more.” Orr’s post also highlights the weaknesses of the system. Despite being a sibling to GPT, for instance, Dall-E 2 can’t really do writing; it focuses on looking right, rather than reading right, leading to images like this, caption “a street protest in belfast”: There’s one last load of images to look at, and it’s a much less rosy one. OpenAI published a detailed document on the “Risks and Limitations” of the tool, and when laid out in one large document, it’s positively alarming. Every major concern from the past decade of AI research is represented somewhere. Take bias and stereotypes: ask Dall-E for a nurse, and it will produce women. Ask it for a lawyer, it will produce men. A “restaurant” will be western; a “wedding” will be heterosexual: The system will also merrily produce explicit content, depicting nudity or violence, even though the team endeavoured to filter that out of its training material. “Some prompts requesting this kind of content are caught with prompt filtering in the DALL·E 2 Preview,” they say, but new problems are thrown up: the use of the 🍆 emoji, for instance, seems to have confused Dall-E 2, so that “‘A person eating eggplant for dinner’; contained phallic imagery in the response.” OpenAI also addresses a more existential problem: the fact that the system will happily generate “trademarked logos and copyrighted characters”. It’s not great on the face of it if your cool new AI keeps spitting out Mickey Mouse images and Disney has to send a stern word. But it also raises awkward questions about the training data for the system, and whether training an AI using images and text scraped off the public internet is, or should be, legal. Not everyone was impressed by OpenAI’s efforts to warn about the harms. “It’s not good enough to simply write reports about the risks of this technology. This is the AI lab equivalent of thoughts and prayers – without action it doesn’t mean anything,” says Mike Cook, a researcher in AI creativity. “It’s useful to read these documents and there are interesting observations in them … But it’s also clear that certain options – such as halting work on these systems – are not on the table. The argument given is that building these systems helps us understand risks and develop solutions, but what did we learn between GPT-2 and GPT-3? It’s just a bigger model with bigger problems. “You don’t need to build a bigger nuclear bomb to know we need disarmament and missile defence. You build a bigger nuclear bomb if you want to be the person who owns the biggest nuclear bomb. OpenAI wants to be a leader, to make products, to build licensable technology. They cannot stop this work for that reason, they’re incapable of it. So the ethics stuff is a dance, much like greenwashing and pinkwashing is with other corporations. They must be seen to make motions towards safety, while maintaining full speed ahead on their work. And just like greenwashing and pinkwashing, we must demand more and lobby for more oversight.” Almost a year on from the first time we looked at a cutting edge AI tool in this newsletter, the field hasn’t shown any signs of getting less contentious. And we haven’t even touched on the chance that AI could “go FOOM” and change the world. File that away for a future letter.

5/4/2022,"Afrontman so influential he affected not just music, fashion and hair styling but an entire way of walking down the street, Liam Gallagher’s star quality continues to be inextinguishable. As he prepares to release his third solo album, C’mon You Know, he will answer your questions – post them in the comments below. As music writer Steven Hyden stated last week, ranking Liam high up in a list of the all-time great lead singers: “He hits all the marks: incredible showman, incredible charisma, widespread influence, and (this isn’t remarked upon enough) he has a fantastic rock’n’roll voice.” Indeed, Liam could charm the birds out of the trees – or amusingly slag them off if they refused – and commands entire stadiums with little more than an upward-tilting chin and a tambourine. But his voice is also a marvel, a high-frequency engine tuned to songs about love, youth and the sheer vibrating brilliance of existence. He put it to era-defining use with Oasis, then with the lower-key Beady Eye, but has gradually wound back up to full knees-out swagger with his solo material. Going against the grain of the rest of the charts, he recently broke the Top 20 to score his biggest solo hit to date with C’mon You Know’s lead single, Everything’s Electric, thanks to its bright, confident, classic melody. This summer he will consciously evoke peaks of Oasis’s popularity, even outdoing them: two concerts at Knebworth mirror the pair the band played in 1996, while a gig at Manchester City’s Etihad Stadium scales up the much-cherished one Oasis played at Maine Road the same year. Those Knebworth shows were immortalised in a recent excellent documentary, whose production company was a joint venture between Liam and his brother Noel. Was this a sign that the pair’s enmity since Oasis – which has manifested in a series of frankly very funny insults back and forth – was thawing? Fans still hold out hope. Whatever happens, we currently have Liam in ambitious and charismatic form, still one of the very best rock stars there is. Ahead of C’mon You Know coming out on 27 May, please ask Liam anything about his life and career – post your questions in the comment section below by Monday 9 May, and his answers will be published on the day of the album’s release.",Arts/Music,Post your questions for Liam Gallagher,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/04/post-your-questions-for-liam-gallagher
5/4/2022,"Brussels bureaucrats are being trained to meditate to help them tackle the climate crisis as part of a new wave of “applied mindfulness” that seeks to take the Buddhism-inspired practice “off the cushion” and into hard politics. EU officials working on the 27-country bloc’s green deal climate policy are attending “inner green deal” courses intended to foster a deeper connection among decision-makers and negotiators tasked with tackling the crisis. The courses incorporate woodland walks near Brussels and meditation sessions, including one that invites participants to feel empathy for trees and animals to boost “environmental compassion”. Some managers have reportedly shown impatience at being asked to meditate and want to “get on with business”. But early results from the first 80 participants suggest the course has strengthened officials’ motivation to tackle climate problems and overcome personal despair that little can be done. Mindfulness has boomed in the west in recent years through courses, meditation apps and books. But it has drawn criticism that it has become a “religion of the self”, with one critic warning of “McMindfulness”. However, it is recognised by the NHS as an effective treatment for recurrent depression when delivered as mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. Now advocates of “applied mindfulness” believe it could accelerate consensus-building between climate decision-makers. A recent report by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlighted the need for “inner transitions” and the potential of meditation to encourage lower-carbon lifestyles. Some UK MPs are backing a policy report launched this week that argues examining the human heart and mind is the “missing dimension” in the global response to the climate crisis. The report, overseen by the Mindfulness Initiative, which supports the UK parliament’s all-party group on mindfulness, says tackling climate breakdown has too long been framed as a problem of technology rather than compassion and empathy, and this is holding back humanity’s ability to move faster and further. Supporters include the former UN climate negotiator Christiana Figueres and the UK’s only Green party MP, Caroline Lucas. The report argues the climate emergency is rooted in “a crisis of relationship that has us treating the world we belong to as a resource to be exploited, and the other people in it primarily as competitors”. It calls urgently for policy attention to “the neglected inner dimension of the climate crisis” and argues for “the importance of mindfulness and compassion practices in restoring the conscious connection fundamental to human and planetary health”. Applying mindfulness, it argues, can help decision-makers mentally “stay with” the often overwhelming problem humanity is facing rather than fleeing it. Figueres, who led the landmark 2015 Paris climate accord negotiations, told the Guardian her practice of “deep listening”, which is related to mindfulness and emerges from Buddhist teaching, was “the key” to the successful agreement. “Had I not been practising deep listening I never would have understood where 195 countries and thousands of stakeholders were coming from,” she said. “I really wanted to know deeply what they were saying. I chalk up a lot of the Paris accord to deep listening.” Lucas said: “Mindfulness is about making the space to feel the connections that could then inspire action. Reaching into people’s deeper empathy for the world is a way of generating the extra energy, motivation and belief that change is possible.” She is among a group of MPs who meditate regularly together at parliament and she said the practice “keeps me on track by reminding myself, amid the noise and distraction of political life, of what’s important”. Under the EU’s training package, officials learn mindfulness practices before being presented with raw facts about the climate emergency. They then explore how they personally relate to problems that can seem overwhelming. Jeroen Janss, who runs the course, said strong emotions often arose, including deep sadness, frustration over lack of progress, guilt and hopelessness. Participants learn how to regulate these emotions, find their personal role and, through collaborating around concrete initiatives, come out with a sense of agency. “They feel ‘I can do something’,” said Janss. “There is less eco-anxiety.” “There is a lot of power in even one or two people being fully present in a meeting,” said one policy officer working on EU-wide climate negotiations who has taken the course. “The inner dimension has been missing for some time and it has the potential to unlock how we collaborate.”",News/World news,EU bureaucrats being trained to meditate to help fight climate crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/04/eu-bureaucrats-being-trained-meditate-help-fight-climate-crisis
5/4/2022,"Last Thursday, I was having a wig fitting for the role of the Queen in Cinderella, ready to begin rehearsing next month. The part, which I signed up for six weeks ago, promised a year-long contract – and with it, a rare level of stability. Three days later, I received a text from a friend offering her sympathy that the production was closing, and saying she was sure I would get another role soon. I had no idea what she was talking about, so she sent me a link to an online article. I felt my stomach drop. My agent didn’t know anything about it either, until he checked his email and saw he’d received a message less than half an hour before – just after 6pm on the Sunday of a bank holiday weekend – to say the show was closing and I no longer had a contract. My initial reaction was one of shock and disbelief, made worse that by telling us in this way, the people in charge – headed by Andrew Lloyd Webber and his Really Useful Group (RUG) production company – seemed to be showing a complete lack of humanity towards their workers. The theatre industry has suffered hugely in the last couple of years. For many of us, this has meant disappearing incomes and a struggle to make ends meet in an industry that is known for its precariousness at the best of times. Actors may be the most visible side, but the pandemic has affected everyone from lighting and sound technicians to stage managers, costume designers and front-of-house staff. Even though our industry raises £1.3bn a year in ticket sales alone, and is a significant contributor to the UK economy – as well as providing the incalculable joy and important conversations that a good show can inspire – theatre salaries are not high, and 70% of the workforce are self-employed contractors with little security. For every star earning thousands a week, there are hundreds of ensemble cast members, craftspeople and technicians earning a fraction of that. If a year-long contract suddenly disappears, it can have a huge effect. This role had meant my bills would be paid for a year. It felt like having the rug pulled out from under me (no pun intended). Theatre is a vocational profession, which can mean many of us simply feel grateful to even earn a living, and everyone is, to a certain degree, made to feel disposable. Like any industry with a big power imbalance, it is the workers who suffer – all too often we accept low wages and poor conditions because it has always been this way – and I would like to see more theatre workers joining their unions. Theatre cannot be an industry where only the wealthy can work. I’d also like those with the power to treat the workers who create the product that they’re selling with humanity. Many creative professions are precarious, and I’m not naive about the nature of our industry. Cinderella was an established musical with good reviews, and so I did feel – mistakenly – a sense of security that comes with that and, in Lloyd Webber, the backing of such a big name in the industry. But you also know when you sign up for most new productions that there’s a possibility they could close within the month. What was particularly painful about Cinderella was how the news was delivered. It’s not acceptable to email agents on a Sunday evening, surely knowing most wouldn’t see it, then announce the news to the world very shortly afterwards. I would like everyone who is affected to receive an apology for the way it was handled, and a guarantee that it won’t happen again. Nobody should find out they’re losing their job this way. I spent a day in tears, and then I decided I needed to speak out. It does feel frightening, because there is a fear instilled in many theatre workers that if they do speak up, word will get around the small pool of people in power, and they’ll be blacklisted. So many people are just grateful that they are surviving in an industry that can be so brutal, they’re reluctant to openly criticise it. I don’t know what’s next for me in terms of work. I feel that, by speaking out, I am putting myself in a precarious situation within the theatre community, but I hope that’s not the case. Theatre is full of passionate, hardworking people. It’s a job we feel privileged to do, but that doesn’t mean we’re dispensable. I live in hope that by highlighting unjust and inhumane employment practices, no matter what industry we’re in, it can improve life for all of us.
