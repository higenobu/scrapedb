4/15/2022,"How funny to think that a new play by David Mamet was once a source of fervent anticipation. After suffering through The Anarchist, The Penitent, China Doll (China Doll! A play written solely so that one character could brain another with a model airplane!) the impulse now is to cower somewhere safe until a run has ended. It isn’t that these recent plays were so disturbing – if only – but that they weren’t really plays, just thin veneers of words barely covering the whine and grumble of complaint. Were some of these words four-letter ones? Of course. It’s the Mamet way. Yet the language, like the contrarianism, has long since calcified into a pose – the lactic acid building and building and building the longer the pose is held. Still, there was a time before – when the writing felt fresh, brash, defiantly alive, a way to inject sedate theaters with the rhythms of the streets. Maybe those rhythms were phoney even then. Or maybe Mamet’s current provocations (he was on Fox News this week, arguing that most teachers are inclined to pedophilia) have poisoned even the back catalog. How else to explain the absence of menace or pity or recognizable human feeling in the finely acted Broadway revival of American Buffalo, directed by Neil Pepe at Circle in the Square? The setting for American Buffalo, designed deliriously by Scott Pask, with lighting by Tyler Micoleau, is a mid-70s dusty junk shop somewhere in Chicago’s grimier precincts. It’s presided over by Donny (Laurence Fishburne), who is joined by a dim-witted errand boy, Bobby (Darren Criss), and a brassy hanger-on, Teach (Sam Rockwell). When a customer buys a buffalo nickel, a coin Donny had dismissed as worthless, for $90, the men concoct a plan – as watertight as leaking bucket – to steal it back. There is pleasure, of course, in Fishburne and Rockwell’s performances. As Donny, Fishburne keeps his voice low, his eyes hooded, his physicality contained until it isn’t. Fishburne’s natural clout lends Donny gravity; his sensitivity to Mamet’s rough jazz offers the character a kind of grace. Rockwell, by contrast, is all sound and tweaked-out fury, twitching, preening, puffing out his meager chest as he clomps around the space, combover flapping in the breeze. Teach thinks he’s smooth, but he’s a serrated knife, cutting into anyone who brushes against him. As Bobby, a man many cards short of a full deck, Criss seems to be playing the dimness rather than inhabiting it, and the performance feels thin. American Buffalo feels thin, too. And sour. Like a cup of diner coffee left to cool. It’s a showcase for actors. But what really is it showcasing? It’s a play about men who feel that life has done them wrong. The way they speak of others – women, queer people, “Mexicans” – suggests that they believe they are owed more, that they are possessors dispossessed, that the American dream is their birthright, even if they never do much to make that dream come through. They fight over scraps – imagined scraps at that – and then they fight one another. Back in the day, there used to be a lot of indignation over Mamet’s language and whether it heralded a coarsening of American letters. The language, it turns out, wasn’t the coarse part.",Arts/Stage,American Buffalo review – David Mamet returns to Broadway with a thud,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/14/american-buffalo-review-david-mamet-broadway
4/15/2022,"Folks: we need to talk about gaffes. It’s now a matter of record that Anthony Albanese stumbled badly on day one on the hustings after a brain fade about the latest unemployment figure and the official cash rate. I understand a lot of readers and viewers couldn’t care less about whether or not the Labor leader can recite statistics like a pet shop parrot. This point is fair enough. Sometimes I wonder why we journalists care about it, given a pop quiz is not a test of anything substantive, because anyone (as Adam Bandt put it memorably this week) can actually Google it. But in this particular instance, it was a bad stumble, not because Albanese couldn’t remember the precise numbers in question, but because he looked, as his mind raced, like he had absolutely no idea what they were (this is a subtle but important distinction). This fed Scott Morrison’s campaign pitch, which is Albanese knows nothing about the economy, and if you put him in the prime ministership, he’ll be immediately out of his depth. This was a partisan contention hovering on the edge of ears pinned back, pure desperation, until Albanese provided a clickable and shareable cue that could be deployed to underscore the central talking point. In any case, the point of this isn’t to rehash old ground but to work through what happened next. By Thursday, the Labor leader (now anointed gaffe-prone, which is better than embattled but probably on the way there) was asked a question about recent developments in the United Kingdom. Boris Johnson appears to be adopting the Australian model of deterrence towards asylum seekers. Here is Thursday’s exchange between a reporter and Albanese. Q: “The UK government has announced a five-year refugee resettlement deal with Rwanda and endorsed boat turnbacks. If people smugglers seek to take advantage of an incoming Labor government and send more boats, will you be tough on boat turnbacks and will you consider an offshore resettlement deal?” Albanese: “We will turn boats back. Turning boats back means that you don’t need offshore detention.” This is exactly what you’d expect the Labor leader to say. The point Albanese made was if you keep the interdiction policy, you don’t have a flood of unauthorised maritime arrivals then necessitating yet another Australian government cooking up yet more obscenely cruel and morally repugnant “lock ‘em up and ship ‘em out” responses to prevent Ray Hadley bellowing on 2GB. If you take the Australian asylum seeker policy cruelty standard as a given (and both of the major parties do in most points of substance) then Albanese’s logic here is impeccable. If there aren’t masses of new arrivals then Australia doesn’t have to convince other countries to process people that Australia should be processing. Ipso facto. Perhaps this point was confusing to some observers because it was logic, as opposed to a premasticated talking point. In any case, the words had barely left Albanese’s mouth when the outing was written up as another gaffe. The Australian declared in an accompanying commentary the Labor leader’s offshore processing gaffe was “arguably … worse than his first” – (the arguably qualifier being deployed here advisedly). Sorry, what? In what universe was this: a) a gaffe; or b) worse than the last one? In the way of things, the bollocks then chased itself. Because Albanese’s non-gaffe was catalogued instantly as a gaffe the Labor leader then had to stop with reporters a second time on Thursday to clarify an observation that didn’t actually require any clarification. Here is that subsequent exchange. Q: “So, what do you mean when you say turning back boats means you don’t need offshore detention?” Albanese: “Well, that’s the preference. At the moment, there aren’t people who have gone into offshore detention in recent times because the boats have been turned back. It’s been effective”. Q: “But you would keep offshore detention in?” Albanese: “Yes.” Glad we cleared that one up. Funnily enough, there was an actual, measurable gaffe on the same day that managed to fly almost entirely below the radar. The Labor leader had described one of his health policy announcements this week as having been “fully costed by the Parliamentary Budget Office”. This was absolute bollocks as it turned out, and the shadow finance minister, Katy Gallagher, later scrambled after the overstatement. “The costing of Labor’s Urgent Care Centre policy is based on work done by the PBO, but for the avoidance of any confusion, has not been formally costed by the PBO,” she said on Twitter. But perhaps this gaffe was a bit boring. Or perhaps it didn’t feed anyone’s campaign narrative? It’s pretty clear that the core objective for Morrison and his amplifiers between now and 21 May is telling voters Albanese is Bernie Sanders in a better suit who knows bugger all about the economy – or alternatively, he’s a closet Noah building an ark to load unworthy queue jumpers on to, because, when it comes to boats, Albanese is no Peter Dutton. No washboard abs. No granite jaw. Sorry I’ll stop now, and loop back to that alleged PBO costing that never happened. Perhaps that particular inconsistency can fall by the wayside because it doesn’t get the smash-up job done? In any case, the first week of the campaign demonstrates this contest is particularly gaffe-hungry. Readers and viewers are entitled to wonder why. My answer is twofold. There’s the phenomenon of amplified partisanship – the trips and slips that serve the objectives of the message war – as we’ve just stepped through. Then there’s a fundamental content deficiency. In this election, the Morrison government has zero long-term plan to discuss and Albanese is determined not to put policy out there that can be weaponised against him. That creates a vacuum. And if there’s a vacuum, you can guarantee that bollocks will quickly fill it, heaping high, because when it comes to Australian politics, the hot takes complex is a hungry beast that cries until it is fed.",News/Australia news,Never mind the bollocks: Albanese’s non-gaffe on immigration was just media hysteria | Katharine Murphy,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/15/never-mind-the-bollocks-albaneses-non-gaffe-on-immigration-was-just-media-hysteria
4/15/2022,"One thing voters should look out for when navigating election media coverage is the reliability of the polls and focus groups behind the headlines. Always read the fine print. Both the Hobart Mercury and the Australian Financial Review claimed on their front pages this week that Anthony Albanese was largely unknown by voters. Nine’s financial daily led its Easter weekend newspaper with an exclusive story ‘Better the devil you know’: Undecideds lean towards PM and a feature inside saying Albo “was poorly defined in the minds of participants” and “neither group could identify any of his strengths”. Earlier in the week the News Corp tabloid asked “Albo Who?” on page one, with a second story inside asking “Anthony Who?”. 🗞 Today's Front Page. Read the Mercury's digital edition, an exact copy of how the paper was printed: https://t.co/qp2cZxCv6T pic.twitter.com/Rlo7Bdqf99 The political editor for the AFR, Phillip Coorey, said undecided voters were “leaning towards Scott Morrison in the belief he is the least bad option come the May 21 election” and “the majority of them say they are prepared to hold their nose and give the government another go”. Given a choice of two underwhelming leaders, undecided voters seem inclined to stick with the devil that they know. https://t.co/VojAVtf3Zn “Focus group research conducted exclusively for The Australian Financial Review finds views of Mr Morrison are largely, but not entirely negative, but Labor leader Anthony Albanese is regarded as dull, disinterested, uninspiring and too negative,” Coorey said. Readers were told the research was based on discussions conducted by Ipsos, a research firm that canvassed two groups of voters drawn from both Liberal and Labor held seats. The AFR did quote Ipsos pollster Don Pole saying no definitive conclusions could be drawn from just two groups: “the election may be closer than the polling implies”. But readers weren’t told that the group discussions had just five participants each. The devastating conclusions for the opposition leader were based on just 10 voters. Ipsos told Weekly Beast the group discussions had five participants each – five in Sydney and five in Melbourne. The Financial Review based not one but two stories on these 10 undecided voters. Meanwhile the Mercury’s story, sub-headlined “Tassie Shocker”, claimed a quarter of voters don’t know Albo’s name based on a survey of “50 people at random”. “These are some of the findings of a poll conducted on April 3 by The Mercury in the north west coast town of Penguin, population about 8000, which, for the past seven federal elections, has broken the way of the party which went on to form government,” the Mercury said. 7.30 host Leigh Sales has become the third high-profile ABC presenter to quit Twitter. Sales deleted her Twitter profile this week several months after writing about the toll of the “non-stop, personal, often vile, frequently unhinged and regularly based on fabrications” abuse she got on the platform. Sales has followed in the footsteps of News Breakfast co-anchor Lisa Millar, who deactivated her Twitter account after being subjected to daily abuse about her interviewing style on the breakfast show. Earlier former Q+A host Hamish Macdonald said one of the reasons he left the ABC was the abuse he received when he was fronting the program. Sales told Weekly Beast there had been no particular trigger for her decision, although elections were a particularly bad time on Twitter. “I just found I’ve been using it less and less over the years and, from past experience, I know election campaigns dial up the hyperpartisan abuse and bullying,” Sales told Weekly Beast. “So I figured it was just a good time to deactivate. No specific incident funnily enough, after the years of ludicrous piles-on. I agree with all the sentiments expressed by Dean Baquet in that email sent to NYT staff about why they’re not viewing Twitter as that useful anymore.” After a week that was dominated by flimsy polls and gotcha questions, the Sydney Morning Herald raised the bar by choosing on Good Friday to focus on a broken election promise by Scott Morrison. Tomorrow’s @smh front page pic.twitter.com/Qcj6WtXeEd “When he told voters at the last election that he would create a federal anti-corruption commission, the prime minister committed himself to introducing a proposal to parliament and fighting to have it passed,” the Herald said in a rare front-page editorial. “He has not. It is a broken promise. “Morrison’s failure to even try passing his integrity commission legislation is not just a broken promise. It raises serious questions about his understanding of transparency and honesty in government.” While Albo’s gotcha question kicked off a horrendous start to the campaign for Labor, Greens leader Adam Bandt’s gotcha question at the National Press Club had the opposite effect. Green’s Leader Adam Bandt with the perfect response to this “gotcha” question and a message to all you “journalists” out there that think this a good way to treat this election campaign. #auspol #AusVotes2022 #Elections2022 pic.twitter.com/kCYimkLPXv In what must be some of the most positive coverage the Greens have had in an election campaign, Bandt’s “Google it mate” answer when Financial Review reporter Ron Mizen asked him what the current wage price index is went viral. “Elections should be about a contest of ideas,” Bandt said. “Politics should be about reaching for the stars and offering a better society. And instead, there’s these questions that are asked, ‘can you tell us this particular stat’ or ‘can you tell us that particular stat?’ The moment has already been immortalised by an Australian graphic artist in a T-shirt, a mug and a cotton tote bag. Andrew Bolt on Sky News Australia had a unique way of assessing the performance of the opposition leader this week. He brought in “body language expert” Dr Louise Mahler who studied videos of Albo and declared he has “all the signs of performance anxiety” based on the way he moved his arms and clenched his jaw. “This is not easily solved, and he’ll be going into a negative spiral at the moment in his thinking which will be very difficult to overcome with this pressure of the campaign,” Mahler told Bolt. Bolt and Mahler also agreed that appearing with the six foot eight Labor Hunter candidate Daniel Repacholi was a mistake because it made the Labor leader look like a “shrinking candidate”. When ABC managing director David Anderson chose Justin Stevens as director of ABC news, a new job had to be found for current affairs boss John Lyons, who had been overlooked for the top job. Lyons formerly ran current affairs and Stevens, the executive producer of 7.30, reported to him, as did the EPs of Australian Story, Four Corners, Q+A, Insiders, Foreign Correspondent and the investigative reporting team. Under the new structure, the roles had been reversed. Lyons, 60, now reported to Stevens, 37. Stevens took just two weeks to find a solution, appointing Lyons to the newly created role of global affairs editor, which will see him return to reporting in a similar role to the one once held by chief international correspondent Philip Williams who retired last April. Lyons has been a foreign correspondent in Washington, New York and Jerusalem. Of course there is now the small problem of filling Lyons’ role when he goes back on the road in June. The obvious choice would be Jo Puccini, who runs the ABC’s investigative reporting team. Although she is relatively unknown to the public. she has a stellar reputation inside Aunty. An ad for a new EP of Four Corners went up last week and an ad for Stevens’ position at 7.30 is yet to be published. Lyons will be an extra body on the ABC’s team of correspondents deployed in Bangkok, Beirut, Istanbul, Jakarta, Jerusalem, London, New Delhi, Port Moresby, Taipei, Tokyo and Washington. “International reporting is one of the core services the ABC provides to our audiences,” Stevens said. “Our correspondents make sense of the key overseas events and issues from an Australian perspective and analyse how they impact us at home.”",News/Media,Financial Review’s numbers game over Albanese falls short as Mercury prints ‘Tassie Shocker’ | The Weekly Beast,https://www.theguardian.com/media/commentisfree/2022/apr/15/financial-reviews-numbers-game-over-albanese-falls-short-as-mercury-prints-tassie-shocker
