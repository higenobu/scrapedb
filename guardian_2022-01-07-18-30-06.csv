1/7/2022,"Aston Villa have agreed a deal to sign Philippe Coutinho on loan from Barcelona for the rest of the season. The final details were settled on Friday for a transfer under which Villa will pay the bulk of the Brazilian’s salary. The move reunites Coutinho with Steven Gerrard, a former Liverpool teammate who is Villa’s head coach. The pair played together from 2013-15 and on Thursday Gerrard described the 29-year-old as a “special footballer”.  Gerrard said: “He’s won two league titles at Barcelona, two Copa del Reys. If you go and have a look at his Wiki page you’ll see a serial winner wherever he goes. He’s won 63 caps for Brazil, played for Barcelona and was incredible at Liverpool. “So I can understand why he’s linked to a lot of football clubs. I can understand why a lot of supporters up and down the country are speaking about him. I don’t think you get a nickname of ‘The Magician’ if you’re not a special footballer.” Coutinho’s time at Barcelona since a move from Liverpool for an initial £106m has in fact not been a success and he spent the 2019-20 season on loan at Bayern Munich. Barcelona have made attempts to sell him since summer 2019 without finding a buyer.",Sport/Football,Aston Villa agree deal to sign Philippe Coutinho on loan from Barcelona,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/07/aston-villa-agree-deal-to-sign-philippe-coutinho-on-loan-from-barcelona
1/7/2022,"Valentina Goncharova’s luminous output offers a window into a lesser-known Soviet history of experimental music, drawing from classical, jazz, and new age electronic sounds behind the iron curtain. Born in 1953 in Kyiv, Ukraine, Goncharova moved to Leningrad (now St Petersburg) at age 16, studying classical violin and contemporary composition at the Leningrad Conservatory, but experienced a revelation at a free jazz concert by the Ganelin Trio in the 1970s. Now set on a path towards the homemade and avant garde, she became involved in the underground rock scene and later married an engineer named Igor Zubkov who built her a modified electric violin. They moved to Tallinn, Estonia, bought a reel-to-reel tape recorder, and began making DIY electroacoustic music, recording household objects with contact mics, and according to one source, building a drum kit from pencils.  The first volume of Goncharova’s enveloping music came out in 2020 on Estonian label Shukai; the second brings together duets with late Finnish experimental musician Pekka Airaksinen, theatre director and instrumentalist Alexander Aksenov and Russian composer Sergey Letov. The focus is on the remarkable music they made together, self-recorded in jams at home, in jazz cafes, apartments and studios in Tallinn, Riga, Helsinki and Moscow between 1987 and 1991. The spiritual Reincarnation II with Aksenov is the standout – it arrives as if waking from a dream, a gauzy dance with Goncharova’s voice wheeling like a bird. Pieces with Letov play with sound as texture – raindrops, and a conversation in which a violin pleads like a child and reeds reply gently, as if in appeasement. With Airaksinen the music is jaunty and off-kilter in the three tracks of compellingly unusual synthesiser jams. All the recordings give the feeling that we are listening in on private play and exchange. It is music made for personal pleasure; as exploration, and therein lies its magnetism. Elsewhere, the excellent future ethnography series Antologia de Música Atípica Portuguesa wraps up with its third volume Canto Devocinário (Discrepant), capturing music by contemporary Portuguese artists drawing on ceremonial vocal sources used alongside drum machines and synths. Gospel et le Râteau (Bisou Records) collects unreleased work by the late Ghédalia Tazartès from across his career, with raunchy chanson, bizarre collage and his distinctive and visionary vocal style, closing with a sung text by Antonin Artaud. Finally, perhaps the first album inspired by a character from TV show Law and Order. Eiko Ishibashi’s For McCoy (Black Truffle) is not as daft as it sounds. It is dominated by slowly unfurling soundscapes for flute, voice, electronics and sax, with an easy, earwormy jazz number for when the credits roll.  This column’s regular author, John Lewis, is away.",Arts/Music,Valentina Goncharova: Recordings 1987​-​1991 Vol 2 review | Jennifer Lucy Allan's contemporary album of the month ,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/07/valentina-goncharova-recordings-1987-1991-vol-2-review-homemade-experiments-gone-right
1/7/2022,"In simple terms, Nat Ogle’s debut novel is the story of a young nurse called Corina. When she is at Guy’s and St Thomas’ hospital in London, she’s caring for her patients. When she’s not working, she’s caring for her mother, who has advanced breast cancer. And in between, she’s trying – often failing – to care for herself in the aftermath of a shattering act of sexual violence. “The problem with surviving,” she notes, “is what to do next.” But In the Seeing Hands of Others does not want to be a simple novel. To that end, it’s presented not in the kind of written-through literary prose where the most jagged element is an artful flashback, but as an assemblage of documents. The spine of the story is told in posts from a blog Corina keeps in 2016, complete with reader comments – some supportive, some not (“Gtfo with your BS and put your face on … tramp”).  Around that is a paper trail of other sources: witness statements, character references, text messages, transcribed voicemails, message board threads, fragments of scripts, screengrabs of emails. It’s a choice that works smartly against Ogle’s lyrical tendencies (he’s also a poet). “Showing the scars, my own sloppy stitches, that’s the point, if there is a point,” writes Corina. “This won’t be a well-made, thought-through thing.” The effect is suggestive of exhibits presented at trial, but we know from Corina’s blog that by the time she writes it, she has already been to court and seen her attacker – her ex-boyfriend, Cameron – go unpunished. So perhaps what Ogle is creating is a second bite at justice for Corina: all the material the police had and everything they didn’t, with the reader in the role of ultimate jury. Because if the original trial had seen everything Ogle lays out in this novel, it’s hard to see how Cameron could have got off, given that he appears to be an ironclad psychopath with no redeeming features whatsoever. Things start off within the bounds of standard rapist rhetoric. A Word document recounting his version of the encounter ends with the resonantly creepy assertion: “From my confident perspective, it was only somewhat messy.” Perhaps that isn’t enough to convince you he’s a nasty piece of work. After all, here’s a statement from his old drama teacher averring that he is “an individual of kindness, compassion and promise”. Ah, but here immediately after is a fragment of a play found on Cameron’s computer. It’s a dialogue between a female teacher and a 15-year-old boy who have been in some kind of sexual relationship. When she tries to break it off, he blackmails her. So much for his character reference. Even Cameron’s name hammers home his untrustworthiness. His surname is Struth: Cameron Struth, Cameron’s Truth. Corina is an imperfect victim – we learn that she was drunk, that she destroyed evidence by washing herself and her sheets, that she had begged Cameron to come to the party where he attacked her, that she got into bed with him – but Cameron is a perfect villain, a 4chan-haunting creep who lives to see the fear in others. Ogle’s publisher has tagged this as a story about “toxic masculinity”, but the dramatic problem for stories about toxic masculinity is that they start with their moral schema already firmly in place. This feels like an unwholesome criticism to be making, tantamount to asking where fiction’s sympathetic sex criminals have gone. But it is a fact that most rapists do not see themselves as wickedness incarnate; they think they are sadly misunderstood. Reading this novel made me crave the disturbing subtlety of Mary Gaitskill, an author who can look self-deception plainly in the eye, and draw nauseating tension from the he-said-she-said. The richest parts of In the Seeing Hands of Others are not in the CSI gameplaying, but in the way Ogle writes about the terror and grace of human vulnerability. “Love, I think, is where two wounds press each other so one wound becomes a kind of gauze for the other wound,” writes Corina. It’s a disgusting image and a beautiful one too, with a complicated truth at its sticky centre.  In the Seeing Hands of Others by Nat Ogle is published by Serpent’s Tail (£14.99).

1/7/2022," For his first film without collaborator/brother Ethan, Joel Coen has delivered a confident, stylish take on Shakespeare’s murderous Scottish play. Denzel Washington is a magnificently brooding Macbeth, while Frances McDormand embraces the dark side as his lady – a role she was born to play. Their regicidal plot is worked out across austere locations in crisp black-and-white imagery reminiscent of Ingmar Bergman’s The Seventh Seal. In an inventive touch, Kathryn Hunter plays all three “weird sisters” while eloquent support comes from Bertie Carvel as the doomed Banquo and Alex Hassell as an intriguingly shifty Ross.Friday 14 January, Apple TV+ Hirokazu Kore-eda’s 2016 drama is another of the great Japanese film-maker’s understated, comic tales of fractured families and the ways they find to muddle through life. Hiroshi Abe plays Ryôta, a divorced, one-time novelist now gambling away his earnings as a private detective and neglecting his young son. His encounters with his no-nonsense widowed mother Yoshiko (Kore-eda regular Kirin Kiki) and long-suffering ex-wife Kyōko (Yōko Maki) nudge him slowly towards sorting his life out, though not exactly in the way he was hoping for.Sunday 9 January, 12.10am, BBC Two Jacques Audiard, the French director of Rust and Bone, is not the first person you would expect to do a western. But this 2018 film is a fine piece of work, nodding respectfully to the genre staples of gunplay and glorious vistas while sneaking in moments of existential reflection. John C Reilly and Joaquin Phoenix play Eli and Charlie, the chalk-and-cheese assassin siblings of the title, sent to follow Jake Gyllenhaal’s scout John Morris to California and then kill a chemist, Hermann Warm (Riz Ahmed), who has developed a potentially lucrative method for extracting gold from rivers.Sunday 9 January, 10pm, BBC Two Here, Marvel stirs a whole new set of myths into its melting pot of fantastical adventures. The Eternals – including Gemma Chan’s Sersi, Richard Madden’s Ikaris and Angelina Jolie’s Thena – are superpowered aliens who have protected humanity down the millennia from destructive beasts called Deviants. In the present day, the group assemble again to fight a resurgence of the creatures, while discovering the true reason behind their mission. It’s portentous stuff but has good action, a dab of wit (courtesy of Kumail Nanjiani) and a lovely gold filigree look to it.Wednesday 12 January, Disney+ The film that confirmed Douglas Sirk as the master of Technicolor melodrama and made Rock Hudson a star. He plays egotistical millionaire playboy Bob, who inadvertently contributes to the death of the doctor husband of Jane Wyman’s Helen. Their improbable connection leads to tragedy, redemption and love among the comfortable upper middle classes, in a movie imbued with a philosophy of selflessness and charity as a spiritual act.Thursday 13 January, 6.45pm, Great! Movies Classic A true story ripe for dramatic treatment, Sara Sugarman’s guileless drama follows the fight to save the Lyric in Carmarthen in the early 1990s. Hairdresser and youth opera director Liz Evans (a warm performance by Samantha Morton) rouses the opposition, including Jonathan Pryce’s retired teacher Mr Morgan, when the council plans to replace the cinema with a shopping centre. There’s light villainy, in the shape of venal mayor Tom (Adeel Akhtar), a dash of Hollywood glamour and a gently reiterated message about the importance of community and local heritage.

In John Hughes’s superb 1987 comedy, the two are thrown together on a frantic, weather-impeded trip from New York to Chicago as they race to get home in time for Thanksgiving. Martin’s advertising executive Neal (superior, quick to anger) and Candy’s travelling salesman Del (genial, accident-prone) are the perfect odd couple in a film that bears comparisons with Midnight Run for its smartly plotted twists and characterful humour.

1/7/2022,"While there may not be as many playoff spots on the line at this stage as was promised when the league introduced the its new 17-game schedule, there’s still a lot at stake this weekend. Beyond the battle for seedings among teams who have already booked their postseason berth, there are five games that will decide who joins them in the playoffs: we preview them here.  What the Steelers need to do to win: If Ben Roethlisberger wants to extend his career at least one more game, he’ll need to win this game and then hope that the Jacksonville Jaguars upset the Indianapolis Colts. Pittsburgh can only control what they control and that means grinding out what’s sure to be another tough, physical game against their perennial rivals. What the Ravens need to do to win: Chances are that Lamar Jackson won’t be back, which is already a huge disadvantage. It’s quite likely that Baltimore’s season will end as it began: with way too many players on the injured list. Still, the Ravens can at least play spoilers by winning what could be a defensive battle and taking advantage of Pittsburgh mistakes. Key player: TJ Watt, outside linebacker, Pittsburgh Steelers. With one more sack, Watt will tie Michael Strahan’s single-season record of 22.5, and needs 1.5 to break it outright. And although Watt is playing in an extended 17-game season he has only made 14 appearances so far (Strahan achieved his record in 16 games). Prediction: The Steelers beat the hobbled Ravens, who would still need additional help to make it to the playoffs even with a win. But it won’t end up mattering for Pittsburgh on account of a game down in Florida … What the Colts need to do to win: Show up? The Colts are the far superior team and are playing for a postseason berth rather than to avoid the NFL’s worst record. They just have to play like they are not facing the season’s biggest embarrassment because if they sleepwalk through this game, the Jaguars will jump at a chance to make their opponent the butt of the joke for a change. What the Jaguars need to do to win: Can they? Let’s be real: this game would be the Jaguars’ Super Bowl if they managed to win it. Sure, the organization would rather have the first pick in this year’s draft but no NFL team wants to go to that well two years in a row. It would be a sign of a franchise-wise failure to capitalize on landing Trevor Lawrence with the top overall pick last year. Key player: Jonathan Taylor, running back, Indianapolis Colts. Aaron Rodgers has probably already secured a second-straight MVP but there’s still plenty of opportunities for Taylor to clinch a solid runner-up showing by putting together another 100+ yard rushing game. Prediction: The Colts win and clinch a playoff spot. What the Saints need to do to win: First of all, they should hope that the Falcons are checked out and don’t go full out in a game that means nothing for them. Assuming that Atlanta do play a competitive game, the Saints will have to hope that they get something out of their unsettled quarterback position. Can Taysom Hill really be their guy? What the Falcons need to do to win: Technically, the Falcons’ season is done but they can play spoilers here, ending the Saints’ attempts to sneak into the postseason. As with the Jaguars, the question might be as much one of will as ability (although the team have already gone 0-2 against Hill as a starter; they may want to avoid 0-3 just for pride’s sake). Key player: Matt Ryan, quarterback, Atlanta Falcons. Here’s an interesting Atlanta-centric subplot to this game, it could be Ryan’s final game as the Falcons’ quarterback. If so, it would be nice to end things with a win at his home stadium. Prediction: Falcons win, ending the Saints’ playoff chances. What the 49ers need to do to win: At this point, an injury to Jimmy Garoppolo means that they haven’t yet announced a starter at quarterback. Whether it ends up being Garoppolo or Trey Lance, the Niners must seize on the opportunity and not give head coach Mike Shanahan a chance to regret his choice. What the Rams need to do to win: LA have to be laser-focused and avoid scoreboard watching if they want to clinch the division with a win. Even with a loss, the Rams can still win the division should the Arizona Cardinals lose to the Seattle Seahawks. Oh and there’s the ball security issue: if Matthew Stafford has another multiple interception game, this one’s probably a wrap quickly. Key player: Aaron Donald, defensive tackle, Los Angeles Rams. The reigning Defensive Player of the Year has a good chance of winning the award once again. A few big plays to help his team wrap up a division title won’t hurt his standing. Prediction: Rams beat the 49ers, who still sneak into the playoffs thanks to the Saints’ loss and other extenuating circumstances. What the Chargers need to do to win: This is how the league drew it up when they came up with the idea of a Week 18 game: a chance to end the season with an old-fashioned win-and-advance contest. The Chargers, like always, will rely on the dynamic arm of their quarterback (in this case, it’s Justin Herbert rather than Philip Rivers) and look to get separation on their opponents. If there’s one thing no Chargers fan wants to see it’s their team in a one-score game late in the fourth quarter. What the Raiders need to do to win: The Chargers are a more talented team than these Raiders, but as Vegas will be playing at home against a team prone to late-game mistakes. The Raiders can’t exactly play conservatively but they will have to play smart, mistake-free football. Key player: Derek Carr, quarterback, Las Vegas Raiders. At this point, Carr is a known entity. He’s a league-average quarterback who will have good games and bad games. This is his shining moment to put together a highlight-reel performance. Prediction: It wouldn’t be a Chargers season without a last-minute collapse. The Raiders win, probably on a last-minute field goal, and move on to the playoffs while the Chargers go home.",Sport/Sport,NFL Week 18 predictions: who will grab the last remaining playoff places?,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/07/nfl-week-18-predictions-chargers-raiders-playoff-places
1/7/2022,"UK house prices rose by 9.8% last year, the fastest rate since 2007, but the boom is predicted to end this year as household finances come under increasing pressure, according to Halifax. The price of the average UK home hit a record high of £276,091 in December, up more than £24,000 over the year, the biggest annual increase since 2003.  Halifax said the housing market “defied expectations” last year, ending with a 3.5% increase in prices in December, a level not seen since the end of 2006. “In 2021 we saw the average house price reach new record highs on eight occasions despite the UK being subject to lockdown for much of the first six months of the year,” said Russell Galley, the managing director of Halifax. Factors that have helped fuel the homebuying boom include the government’s stamp duty holiday, which came to an end in England and Northern Ireland in September after finishing earlier in Scotland and Wales, historically low interest rates and the “race for space” sparked by the pandemic-fuelled shift to remote and flexible working. Halifax expects UK house price growth to slow considerably compared with the red-hot rates of the past two years of the pandemic. “Looking ahead, the prospect that interest rates may rise further this year to tackle rising inflation, and increasing pressures on household budgets, suggests house price growth will slow considerably,” Galley said. “Our expectation is that house prices will maintain their current strong levels but that growth relative to the last two years will be at a slower pace.” Wales had the fastest house price growth in the UK over a calendar year, 14.5%, to £205,579. Northern Ireland also performed strongly, with prices rising 10.6% to an average of £170,946. House prices also continued to rise in Scotland, up 9.7% to £192,988, the most expensive on record. In England, the north-west was the strongest performing region, up 11.8% to £211,954, followed by the south-west, where prices climbed 11% to £287,774. “The demand for housing continues to outstrip supply, which is underpinning house prices,” said Jan Crosby, the UK head of infrastructure, building and construction at KPMG. “Developers can’t build quickly enough to sell into the strong market – particularly for family housing with outdoor space.”",News/Business,UK house prices rise at fastest pace since 2007 but boom predicted to end,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/07/uk-house-prices-rise-at-fastest-pace-since-2007-but-boom-predicted-to-end
1/7/2022,"Were the songs covered by Chan Marshall on her 11th album as Cat Power left in their original form, they would constitute a stonking playlist. Taking in everything from forgotten classics (country superstar Kitty Wells’ It Wasn’t God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels) to beloved classics (These Days by Nico), from obscure numbers by obscure artists (Pa Pa Power by Ryan Gosling’s band Dead Man’s Bones) to obscure numbers by the greats (Iggy Pop’s The Endless Sea), it would be genre-spanning – there is jazz (Billie Holiday’s I’ll Be Seeing You), pop (Lana Del Rey’s White Mustang), R&B (Frank Ocean’s Bad Religion), country, folk and punk – and era-traversing: every decade from the 1940s to the 2010s is represented.  As a covers album, however, it is less life-enhancing. Marshall has chosen artists with hugely distinctive voices and replaced them with her atmospheric but breathily subtle vocals (plus rumbling and folksy instrumentation). That these songs also tend to have wending, impressionistic melodies means that without a really idiosyncratic delivery, they don’t quite cut through. Stripped of Shane MacGowan’s inimitable rasp, the Pogues’ A Pair of Brown Eyes is still beautiful but far less thrilling; White Mustang and Bad Religion are similarly robbed of their power. Where a song looms large in the collective memory, a nuanced take has value – such as Marshall’s warmer, looser version of These Days – but other tracks, such as the bristlingly strange The Endless Sea, are simply made more pedestrian and palatable. Not so much fresh takes on old favourites, Covers is more like watered-down versions of semi-hidden gems.
