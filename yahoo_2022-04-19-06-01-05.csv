4/19/2022,"It’s no secret that inflation is breaking record 40-year highs, as it just hit 8.5%. High inflation and other factors have led to an inverted yield curve in March 2022. With an inverted yield curve, short-term Treasury bonds have higher interest rates than long-term ones, which normally isn’t the case. An inverted yield curve is often interpreted as an early predictor of a recession. The yield curve inverted before the 2001, 2008 and 2020 recessions. However, real estate investment trusts (REITs) can be a good investment during high inflation since they earn most of their revenue from tenant rents, which increase during this time. All REITs aren’t created equal, and this guide shows you a few options that can help your portfolio withstand a recession. What Are Publicly Traded REITs? Publicly traded REITs are registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and trade on a stock exchange like the Nasdaq exchange or New York Stock Exchange. Advantages of publicly traded REITs include: Higher liquidity Greater transparency Lower barrier to entry Two In-Demand Publicly Traded REITs 1. Digital Realty Trust Data science is one of the most in-demand fields, which is predicted to have a job growth rate of 28% through 2026. One way to invest in real estate and data science simultaneously is via a REIT called Digital Realty Trust Inc. (NYSE: DLR). This firm acquires, operates and manages data centers in the U.S. as well as in 25 other countries. The company is growing substantially since it acquired a major stake in a premier African data firm, Teraco. Digital Realty Trust outpaces its competition with a three-year net income growth rate of 72.8% and a relatively low debt-to-equity ratio of 0.84%. 2. Extra Space Storage Since the COVID-19 pandemic, more people have moved, increasing the need for storage space. Extra Space Storage (NYSE: EXR) is a publicly traded REIT that meets this demand throughout most of the U.S. In addition to personal storage space, customers can also store larger items like RVs, cars and boats. Its stock price has grown by 56% since April 2021. Compared to the competition, it has a higher profit margin and a return on equity (ROE) of 52.40% and 29.18%, respectively. Public, Non-Traded REITs Public, non-traded REITs are registered with the SEC but don’t trade on major stock exchanges. By not trading on exchanges, these REITs aren’t subject to daily stock market price changes, which makes it easier for fund managers to focus on long-term goals and can reduce risk and volatility. Registration with the SEC provides transparency. Platforms like RealtyMogul and Streitwise help average individuals invest in public, non-traded REITs. With RealtyMogul, investors select from retail, office, multi-family and apartment complex investment options. Streitwise currently has one main offer, 1st Streit Office, which is currently composed of two class A commercial properties.

Investing in real estate, especially with REITs, can be a useful inflation hedge. Unlike fiat currency, real estate is a tangible asset, and rents rise during inflationary periods. Publicly traded and non-traded REITs serve sub-niches like data science or healthcare. Perform due diligence before investing and realize that some of the more profitable REITs tend to serve high growth, in-demand sub-niches, including the data science and self-storage sectors.

4/19/2022,"President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden released their income tax returns last week. The first couple reported $610,702 in adjusted gross income and paid $150,439 in federal income tax at an effective tax rate of 24.6%. While it’s unclear what former president Donald Trump’s income or tax bill was for 2021, we can compare Biden’s 2017 federal tax return with the data The New York Times reported on regarding Trump’s income tax payment in 2017. Biden’s 2017 tax return showed $11,031,309 in adjusted gross income and a federal tax payment of $3,553,249. The New York Times reported that Trump only paid $750 in federal income taxes that year, the same as he paid in 2016. According to The New York Times, the former president’s various businesses lost hundreds of millions of dollars over the previous 20 years, allowing him to reduce his federal tax obligation to almost nothing. Benzinga hasn’t seen Trump’s tax returns and cannot verify the facts reported on by the Times. However, assumptions can be made based on Trump’s largest business venture - his real estate holdings. Real Estate Tax Benefits Real estate offers some unique tax advantages, mainly the ability to write-off depreciation against income. In fact, it’s quite common for a real estate investor to show a loss on their income tax return while actually receiving positive cash flow for the year. This tax strategy can be seen across almost all equity real estate investment trusts (REITs). For example, Piedmont Office Realty Trust (NYSE: PDM) reported a net loss of nearly $1.2 million for 2021, which included a $120.6 million expense for depreciation and amortization. The company’s actual funds from operations (FFO) was $245.4 million. While the company’s tax returns showed a loss, it was actually able to pay out over $104 million to its shareholders for the year in dividends. Another likely reason for Trump’s low tax bills is the use of a tax loss carryforward. Companies, such as The Trump Organization, can carry losses over from one year to offset taxes in subsequent years. Trump used this strategy after realizing nearly $1 billion in losses in the early 90s. He was able to carry those losses over each year until 2005. Joe Biden’s 2017 income, on the other hand, was mainly earned through speaking engagements and book deals, neither of which offers the same tax advantages as real estate. How Individuals Use This Tax Strategy Individual real estate investors use Trump’s tax strategy every year, which is one reason real estate is such a popular asset class. Investors can even take advantage of these tax benefits without having to purchase a skyscraper, hotel or apartment complex themselves. Passive investments as a limited partner through private equity real estate deals can provide many of the same benefits. Investors that take part in a direct real estate investment through a crowdfunded offering will receive a K-1 tax document each year, which shows the investor’s share of net income, or loss, after deducting expenses like depreciation. It’s not uncommon for investors to receive cash distributions throughout the year, then be able to show a loss on their tax returns.

It’s always a good idea to consult with a certified public accountant to determine how a particular investment will affect your unique tax situation.

4/19/2022,"For decades, homeownership has been a quintessential part of the American dream. Owning a home can boost your net worth since homeowners have a net worth 40 times greater than non-homeowners, according to a 2020 Federal Reserve study. But homeownership is a big responsibility and comes with hidden costs like property taxes, HOA fees, insurance and repairs. Additionally, it’s also becoming out of reach for many because of inflation, high demand and recent interest rate hikes. Despite this, new opportunities have emerged in this changing market, including the rise of real estate crowdfunding platforms and higher returns for single family home investors. A Changing Housing Landscape For past generations, it was relatively easy to buy a home. In 1960, an average home cost $11,900 while the median household income was $5,600. In 2022, the average home price is $384,000 with the median household income fluctuating around $74,000. Home prices rose by 15.4% from January 2020 to 2021. One of the main reasons behind these rapidly appreciating prices was low interest rates. When mortgage rates are low, borrowers can be incentivized to buy pricier homes since the interest costs will be cheaper. Currently, mortgage rates are increasing since the Federal Reserve raised the Federal Funds Rate by 0.25 percent. The Federal Reserve raised rates to combat record high inflation, which has been hovering around 7% to 8%. High inflation and lower wages have made it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for younger generations to buy their first homes. Another important factor to consider is that many younger generations have student debt, with the average debt for a bachelor's degree holder being $37,172 in 2022. To complicate matters, institutional investors, including funds like Blackrock, have been buying single family homes. These large investment funds have the resources to purchase homes in cash and can easily outbid private homebuyers. In turn, this has led to a 19.3 percent increase in rent from December 2020 to December 2021 nationwide. Is Homeownership Still a Goal for Younger Generations? Achieving homeownership is a lofty goal for those in the younger generations. However, this group of people can have a different outlook on life since they’re less likely to purchase larger items like cars or homes. They marry later, if at all, as the average marriage ages for men and women are 35 and 33, respectively. By forgoing large purchases and marriage, younger generations have more freedom. For example, they’re more likely to travel, with millennials spending $200 billion on travel in 2018. Additionally,  63% percent of millennials regret purchasing a home. Some reasons include overpaying, having high monthly housing expenses, being tied to one location, experiencing a bad neighborhood fit and decreasing values. Many millennials also underestimate hidden costs like surprise repairs, closing costs, property taxes and homeowner’s insurance. Why Younger Generations Prefer Renting Instead of Owning One of the main benefits of being a renter is that the landlord covers repair costs like leaky toilets or broken air conditioners and some utility expenses. Landlords also assume risks like depreciating prices. Many millennials and Gen Z’ers frequently change jobs, with the average job tenure for this group ranging from 2 to 3 years. Job changing may also necessitate moving to different cities for the best job opportunities. Renting makes it easier to travel and move when needed compared to owning a home. Younger generations also value amenities like swimming pools and gyms that make their lives more convenient and help them meet new, like-minded friends. Does This Trend Present New Opportunities for Retail Investors? A silver lining to this situation means opportunity for investors, including the ability to invest in fractional real estate investments via crowdfunding. Crowdfunding platforms like Arrived Homes let investors buy shares of rental properties. Instead of needing a large down payment, investors can get real estate exposure for as low as $100. Current market conditions also make the single family rental market more appealing. Single family home renters are more likely to renew leases, and this sector tends to be more stable than other real estate sub niches. For example, office space demand dropped during the COVID-19 pandemic, but single family homes will always be desired. These factors can lead to higher returns for single family home investors.

While homeownership can increase an investor’s net worth, it has become more out of reach for younger generations. High inflation, rate hikes and corporate investors are a few reasons that contribute to this unique situation, giving rise to new investment opportunities that include real estate crowdfunding and higher returns for the single family rental market.

4/19/2022,"(Reuters) - Russia on Monday flagged a likely further cut in interest rates and more budget spending to help the economy adapt to biting western sanctions as it heads for its deepest contraction since 1994. Russia faces soaring inflation and capital flight while grappling with a possible debt default after the West imposed unprecedented sanctions to punish President Vladimir Putin for sending tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24. Putin said on Monday that Russia should use its state budget to support the economy and liquidity when lending activity has waned. The World Bank expects the economy to shrink by more than 11% this year. The central bank more than doubled its key interest rate to 20% on Feb. 28 as the first wave of sanctions hit, before trimming it to 17% on April 8. It is expected to lower it further at the next board meeting on April 29. ""We must have the possibility to lower the key rate faster,"" Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina said on Monday. ""We must create conditions to increase the availability of credit for the economy."" Although inflation in Russia has accelerated to its highest since early 2002, the central bank ""will not try to lower it by any means - this would prevent business from adapting,"" Nabiullina said. The current inflation spike is caused by low supply, not high demand, and the central bank aims to bring it to its 4% target in 2024 as the economy adapts to western sanctions, she said, speaking at the lower house of parliament. ""The period when the economy can live on reserves is finite. And already in the second and third quarter we will enter a period of structural transformation and the search for new business models,"" Nabiullina said. She also said Moscow planned to take legal action over the blocking of gold, forex and assets belonging to Russian residents, while adding that such a step would need to be painstakingly thought through. Foreign sanctions have frozen about $300 billion of the roughly $640 billion that Russia had in its gold and forex reserves when it launched what it calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. Putin, speaking to Nabiullina and other top government officials by a video link, called for an acceleration of the process of switching to national currencies in foreign trade - as opposed to dollars and euros - under the new conditions. SANCTIONS BITE Sanctions had mainly affected the financial market, ""but now they will begin to increasingly affect the economy,"" Nabiullina said. ""The main problems will be associated with restrictions on imports and logistics of foreign trade, and in the future with restrictions on exports."" She said Russian companies would need to adapt. ""Russian manufacturers will need to search for new partners, logistics, or switch to the production of products of previous generations,"" she said. Exporters would need to look for new partners and logistical arrangements and ""all this will take time,"" Nabiullina said. She said the central bank was considering making the sale of forex proceeds by exporters more flexible. In February, Russia ordered exporting companies, including some of the world's biggest energy producers from Gazprom to Rosneft, to sell 80% of their forex revenues on the market, as the central bank's ability to intervene on currency markets was limited. The bank may soften the terms of the timing and volume of mandatory sales, Nabiullina said. Nabiullina's comments ""are directly or indirectly targeted at preventing the rouble from firming,"" Promsvyazbank analysts said. But the Russian currency extended gains on Monday, firming to 81.4025 to the euro, a level last seen on April 8, helped by upcoming tax payments that will prompt export-focused companies to convert FX revenues to roubles to meet their liabilities.
