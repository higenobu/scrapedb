2/19/2022,"Lewis Hamilton has issued a bullish statement of intent for his return to Formula One this year. Hamilton was speaking publicly for the first time since he was controversially denied the world championship in last season’s finale in Abu Dhabi. The seven-time champion insisted he “refused to be defined” by the adversity and that the experience only spurred him on to come back stronger than ever, despite briefly losing his faith in the sport. Hamilton endured crushing disappointment when set to take his eighth title in Abu Dhabi only for an intervention by the race director, Michael Masi. The Australian’s improvisation of safety car rules gave Red Bull’s Max Verstappen a crucial advantage and the Dutchman went on to win and take his first championship.  Hamilton’s Mercedes team launched their new car the W13 on Friday and the 37-year-old, having retreated from the public eye and social media for the entire close season amid speculation that he would retire from F1, came back in sprightly, good cheer, clearly fired up for the new campaign, his 16th in the sport. Hamilton admitted it had been a “difficult time” post Abu Dhabi and that he had dealt with it by switching off from F1 and spending time with his extended family, while controversy raged around what had happened. During the winter his team principal, Toto Wolff, said the driver had been disillusioned with F1. “I always see that through these experiences you can turn that emotion into strength and power and that is what I am doing,” Hamilton said. “If you think what you saw at the end of last year was my best, wait until you see this year. “Ultimately this is the sport I have loved my whole life [but] there was a moment where I had lost a little bit of faith with the system. But I am generally a very determined person. I thought whilst moments like this might define others’ careers, I refuse to let this define mine. So I focused on being the best I could be and coming back stronger.” On Thursday F1’s governing body, the FIA, announced it had dismissed Masi from his position as race director and were instituting changes to prevent a repeat of the events in Abu Dhabi. It has not published its report into the race but that it has felt the need for structural adjustments presents a strong indication that what happened in Abu Dhabi did not follow its own regulations. Hamilton welcomed the FIA’s actions, but pointedly noted that they were no compensation for the impact the events had on him. “Whilst we can’t change the past – nothing will ever be able to change the way and I how I felt at the time, and how I feel about the situation – it’s good to see the FIA is taking steps to make improvements,” he said. “Accountability is key, we have to use this moment to make sure this never happens to anyone else in the sport ever again.” Hamilton and Verstappen had engaged in a fascinating nip-and-tuck battle across all 22 races last season, with the pair clashing on track repeatedly. Their relationship remained largely respectful despite the ferocity of their title fight. Hamilton congratulated Verstappen immediately after the race in Abu Dhabi and insisted that going into the new season he bore no ill-will toward the Dutchman for the manner in which he secured his first title. “This has nothing to do with Max,” Hamilton said. “Max did everything a driver would do given the opportunity he was given. He is a great competitor and we will go into another battle like we did last year and conduct ourselves and grow from our races and experiences last year. “I have no issues with him, I don’t hold any grudges with anybody. I don’t think that is a good thing to carry round with you, I don’t have anything over my shoulder holding me back. I am not letting that experience be one of those.” Wolff, who said he had not been concerned that Hamilton would opt not to come back to racing, believed his driver was returning with an aggressive enthusiasm to once more join the fray. “What he did was absolutely right to take himself out of the microcosm of F1 and step aside and black out socially,” he said. “He has come back in a great mindset. He is positive, he is determined. Yet again adversity that was thrown at him will make him stronger. As he said: it’s attack mode.”",Sport/Sport,Bullish Lewis Hamilton ‘coming back stronger’ to chase F1 title again,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/18/lewis-hamilton-f1-title-abu-dhabi
2/19/2022,"Hermès, the French luxury goods maker, is opening three new factories as it struggles to keep up with demand for its £5,000-plus Birkin and Kelly handbags. The company said on Friday it planned to open new leather goods factories in the French towns of Louviers, Sormonne and Riom before 2024 in order to increase and speed up its production of the expensive bags.  It has also recently opened its first leather-working school to train more craftspeople in the art of handbag making. The company, which already has more than 4,300 leather workers on its staff, said it was hiring more than 400 artisans each year. However, Hermès said it needed far more to keep up with demand for its handbags, which has jumped during the Covid pandemic as soaring stock markets have left the world’s richest people with a lot more disposable income. The bags have become must-have collectibles for the super-rich and celebrities, including Victoria Beckham, Katie Holmes, Rita Ora and Kelly Brook, with some women owning hundreds of the most sought-after designs. Rare Hermès bags have also proven extremely popular at auction, with some selling for almost £300,000. “We are facing high demand, and we have a product that is very handcrafted,” the executive chairman of Hermès, Axel Dumas, said. “It takes 15 hours [to create] an Hermès bag. Even if there’s a lot of demand, I’m not going to start doing them in 13 hours to raise production.” Dumas said there was often a long waiting list for the bags. “Contrary to what people may think, we’re always very sad when we have to say no to our customers, because we don’t have that.” He ruled out raising prices. The lack of handbag stock led to a 5.4% drop in fourth-quarter sales at its leather goods and saddlery division, which accounts for almost half of total sales. The news sent Hermès shares down 7% on Friday, before recovering slightly to a 5% decline, which was still its biggest one-day fall since 2016. Overall sales rose to €2.38bn in the three months to December, with American and Chinese shoppers driving strong growth, but were below analyst forecasts of €2.53bn. The slow growth at Hermès contrasts with an acceleration at other luxury groups such as LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world’s largest luxury label, and the Gucci owner, Kering, which have posted much better-than-expected results.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Luxury brand Hermès plans new factories as handbag demand soars,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/feb/18/luxury-brand-hermes-plans-new-factories-as-handbag-demand-soars
2/19/2022,"Great Britain have set up the chance of a golden weekend at the Beijing Winter Olympics after the women’s curling team joined the men’s quartet in sealing passage to the final of their competition with a dramatic 12-11 extra-end win over Sweden.  Eve Muirhead’s team fell 4-0 down to the reigning champions in the opening end but bounced back with three points of their own in the second. That wild opening presaged a cagey contest which saw Sweden lead 8-7 going into the ninth end. A superb final stone from Muirhead in that end produced four points for Great Britain and an 11-8 lead. Sweden, though, remarkably found the three points they needed in the 10th and final leg to take the tie into an extra end with the scores at 11-11. But in that end Muirhead and her team shook off the disappointment and held their nerve, denying Sweden opportunities and sealing the win without having to throw the final stone. “Third time lucky. I’ve lost two semi-finals before and I really was desperate for it,” Muirhead said afterwards. “All week we’ve dug deep ... I’m pretty speechless right now, but what a moment. I’m pretty proud to say we are in an Olympic final.” The GB men’s team take on their Swedish counterparts in the gold medal match at 6.50am GMT on Saturday, while Muirhead and co will face Japan at 1.05am on Sunday morning.

2/19/2022,"Millions of people experienced severe disruption as record-breaking winds swept in with Storm Eunice, causing huge structural damage, transport chaos, widespread power cuts and forcing tens of thousands of workers and pupils to remain at home. The Met Office said a wind speed of up to 122 miles an hour was recorded at the Needles on the Isle of Wight on Friday, provisionally the highest ever in England.

They have been taken to hospital with serious injuries.” ⚠️ 🚨 DANGER DUE TO STORM EUNICEA member of the public have been struck by falling debris from a roof in Station Road, Henley-on-Thames caused by #StormEuniceThey have been taken to hospital with serious injuries by our colleagues from @SCAS999 pic.twitter.com/oHOIV4bJu3 The London ambulance service said two people were injured in separate incidents potentially linked to Storm Eunice. A man was taken to hospital after being struck by falling debris in Waterloo, while another is receiving treatment after being struck by a tree in Streatham, south London, shortly before 11am. Buildings ranging from the lifeboat station at Sennen on the western tip of Cornwall to the Millennium Dome in London sustained damage and both Severn bridges in south Wales were shut for the first time because of wind. A beloved tree on a square in Bude, north Cornwall, crashed to the ground and many hundreds more across the south of England and south Wales fell, blocking roads and bringing down power lines. The top of a church spire in Wells, Somerset, was toppled by gusts. Snow also brought disruption to Scotland, with reports of about 150 schools closed. The UK government’s Cobra civil contingencies committee will hold a meeting on Friday afternoon to discuss the response to Storm Eunice. Boris Johnson has advised people to follow safety advice, and the army standing by. Two Met Office’s red weather warnings, affecting 20 million people, were in place for the south-west of England, south Wales, London and large parts of south-east England. Before Friday, the strongest gust recorded at a low-level location in England was 118mph at Gwennap Head in Cornwall on December 15 1979. The peak wind speed reached during the great storm of 15-16 October 1987 was 115mph. Cornwall and south Wales bore the brunt of the storm early on Friday. Devon and Cornwall police sent officers to Sennen Cove, near Penzance, where the roof of the lifeboat station had come off and was resting on power cables. The Millennium Dome was badly damaged on Friday morning as the wind ripped off panels. A witness, Mala Sharma, watched as “more and more parts are getting ripped off”. She said the damage “started off with a patch” but then a chunk of the roof was ripped off. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said: “I urge all Londoners to stay at home, do not take risks, and do not travel unless it is absolutely essential.” Eunice brought many transport services to a standstill. Trains in many places, including the whole of Wales, were cancelled, with 50mph speed restrictions elsewhere in Britain. Services into London stations including Waterloo and later Euston were entirely suspended for parts of the day. With police and motoring organisations warning drivers to stay home, the Severn crossings into Wales were closed, along with the Humber and Dartford Bridge crossings. Roads, including a motorway, were blocked by fallen trees. Ferry services across the Channel and Irish Sea were suspended as the storm whipped up high waves. Hundreds of flights were cancelled by British Airways and others, and some arrivals were diverted or took several attempts to land at Heathrow and Gatwick airports in high winds. Western Power Distribution, which serves homes in Wales, the Midlands and the south-west of England, said about 85,000 customers had lost power. The Environment Agency issued 10 severe flood warnings – eight along the Severn and two along the Wye – meaning there was a danger to life, as well as dozens of flood warnings and more than 100 flood alerts. However, fears that high tides could lead to widespread flooding seemed unfounded. Those hoping to hunker down with a takeaway during the storm may be disappointed. Deliveroo, JustEat and UberEats said they had paused deliveries in affected areas, including London, Wales and parts of the south-east and west, owing to fears for the safety of their riders. More windy weather on Saturday could affect cleanup efforts in the aftermath of Storm Eunice, the Met Office said. “The winds themselves could cause minor disruption but given the expected impact from Storm Eunice on Friday, these conditions on Saturday may hamper any clear-up operations.”",News/UK news,Storm Eunice: record-breaking gusts bring chaos to millions across UK,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/18/storm-eunice-record-breaking-gusts-chaos-millions-uk-britain-met-office
2/19/2022,"Orange blossom is a flavour that polarises: either you love it or you can’t stand it. For me, it brings a delicate, floral lightness to desserts, especially really creamy ones such as cheesecakes, but I understand that a heavy hand can turn things a little sickly – medicinal, even. The strength of orange blossom water varies between brands, so start with one tablespoon, taste and work your way up from there.

Line the base of a 20cm springform or loose-bottomed cake tin and lightly grease the sides. Put the walnuts in a large saucepan and toast on medium-high heat, shaking frequently, until they start to brown and smell nutty. Tip the digestives and 50g of the walnuts into a food processor (save the rest of the nuts for the topping). Blitz until fine, then pour into a bowl and stir in the melted butter, coating the crumbs evenly. Tip into the base of the lined cake tin, pressing down firmly, then bake for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside. Once cool, wrap the tin tightly in two layers of strong tinfoil, making sure it comes up the sides of the tin. To make the filling, whip the ricotta in a food processor or with an electric whisk until smooth and creamy. Add the cream cheese, sugar and orange zest, beating again until combined, then stir in the orange blossom water and salt. Add the eggs, mix until just incorporated, then pour the batter over the biscuit base in the tin. Put the tin in a large, deep roasting tray and fill with hot water to come roughly halfway up the sides. Bake for 60-70 minutes, until the edges are set but there is still a slight jiggle in the middle. Turn off the oven, and leave to cool inside it for about an hour with the door ajar. Once cool, chill in the fridge for at least four hours, or overnight. Meanwhile, make the topping. Put all the ingredients in a small saucepan, bring to boil, then leave to bubble for two to three minutes, until it looks syrupy. Roughly chop the remaining 100g toasted walnuts. Take the pan off the heat and stir in the walnuts so they’re evenly coated. Decorate the chilled cheesecake with the topping, slice and serve.

2/19/2022,"You needn’t be a Hollywood expert to be familiar with the movie motif of a flag fluttering on a conquered planet far away. But as real-life space exploration is an increasingly global collaboration, isn’t it time Earth had its own flag? I asked Oskar Pernefeldt, Swedish founder of the International Flag of Planet Earth Organization, which campaigns for his Earth flag to be adopted. Hi Oskar! Tell me more about the flag you’ve designed. I know it’s blue – presumably for water because we’re the blue planet?Yes, it’s blue, and in its centre are seven connected rings forming a flower, which represents life on Earth and how we’re all connected, and our challenges are shared.  Is that how flags work? Someone makes one and then a nation says, “OK, sure.”Kind of. Usually people design a flag and then propose it to someone – like to a newly formed nation. But how will we – the world – show our agreement? Please, no more referendums.Our hope is for it to be unofficially recognised. Like the rainbow flag, which was proposed in 1978. That didn’t have a client – it was just a flag that informally became adopted by enough people until it became a symbol of the LGBTQ+ community. And there is a practical use: like how on a drop-down menu with countries represented by their flags, there’s no image for global. I can see how it might lend itself to protest movements.I’ve already seen it at climate demonstrations, and it’s been on refugee boats in the Mediterranean. I come from a flag enthusiast’s perspective and I just saw a gap in the flag system. I could totally see other planets having a flag, too. Why do you love flags so much? I always considered myself flag neutral, maybe even flag avoidant if it’s getting a bit too nationalistic.But that’s why I love flags. People attach so many emotions to them. And when you study them, you can see what a country wants to represent. So you might see in a symbolic description of a flag that red stands for the bloodshed in the creation of the country. And then there are the different customs and schools of thought. One convention is not using typography – yet Saudi Arabia and South Korea do. Another is that a child should be able to draw it. But that’s not the case with Wales. Why do neighbouring countries often have similar colours?It’s a shared culture thing. So a lot of flags in the Middle East use what’s called the pan-Arab colour scheme: Kuwait, Iraq and Palestine all have white, red, green and black. The pan-Slavic colours, used in the Balkans, are red, white and blue. If I was commissioning one for the Republic of Coco, I’d be tempted to strike out on my own. Anyone done a purple flag? Presumably, Prince.I’ve only seen it once – the Scouts. I don’t know why I’m surprised there is so much meaning. Symbols have power, it’s why we argue about them. And I suppose if we get rid of old symbols, we need new ones in their place.That’s exactly why I proposed it. Maybe people don’t feel an emotional connection to their home country, but they see themselves as global citizens. But, given the state we’re in and the challenges we face, I think we need a symbol to rally around.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Does the Earth need its own flag?

2/19/2022,"As a Cumbrian, it’s almost surreal that the area has become a foodie magnet – chefs are going to live there because its restaurants are turning into the best in the world. In the 1980s, when I was growing up, eating out in Carlisle was a special occasion. You did it on your birthday and would get taken to Wimpy or the local Italian for garlic bread, spaghetti and a baked lasagne. The poshest places would be inside hotels, which were quite terrifying for working-class people like my family. You might go for your gran’s wedding anniversary, and you’d have a Florida cocktail and chicken breast – it was plain food. In the late 80s and early 90s, pubs in the countryside moved into food because they couldn’t live off beer profits as people didn’t drink and drive any more. That’s when we started going out more, but then it would be gammon with a slice of pineapple and chips, scampi in a basket and Sunday lunch.  It makes me proud that everyone has started to turn up now and see Cumbria. Simon Rogan, whose restaurant L’Enclume has just won three Michelin stars, had the foresight to go to south Cumbria, and what he’s done is very metropolitan: a market garden and micro-nursery and bringing the ideas you usually find floating around Soho to the north. Cumbria has certainly become savvier at selling its amazing produce – for years we just accepted that we made incredible sausages, pies and cheese. When I go into Fortnum & Mason now, Cumbrian things are front and centre, and I love that. You see Cumberland sausages on the menu in the best restaurants, and Cumbria is full to the brim with people living on the side of a mountain making exemplary honey. It’s become rather cool. There are now some really good places up near Carlisle, like Pentonbridge Inn and the Hidden River Cafe at Longtown, and there are lots of amazing places off the beaten track to be discovered. The Yan in Grasmere is a beautiful farm in the middle of nowhere: it’s not fancy but it’s hearty and the chef makes a Cumberland sausage platter that I absolutely love. I swear by Henrock in Bowness-on-Windermere: the scenery is incredible and they’ve spent millions on the art in the gardens. I had the “zero fashioned” cocktail, which was made with caramelised banana skins and caramelised banana syrup, grilled fillet of pollack with curried cauliflower and roast shrimp and lemongrass, and a chocolate, raspberry and peanut tart, which was amazing. Cumbrians have been swept up into this world.

2/19/2022,"The UK has been a world leader in free coronavirus testing throughout the pandemic. On an average day it runs around 300,000 PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests, and about a million people take LFTs (lateral flow tests), at no charge to the individual. These tests have provided surveillance data for new variants, and allowed infected people to rapidly isolate, protecting others from infection. Testing has also reduced anxiety among those returning to work or school environments through knowing that those sharing their space were testing regularly. As we move towards the government’s “Living with Covid-19” strategy, it is expected that widespread access to free testing will be removed, or at least greatly reduced. Some will celebrate the freedom from having to check their infection status, while others are likely to have anxiety and concerns given that there are still considerable community transmission levels. Without access to free testing – and without public health guidance to test often – some may also feel pressured to continue to work when unwell. Management of sickness in the workplace will need consideration.  The advantages include cost-saving and a move towards “normalisation” of living with Covid-19. Testing at the levels we witnessed during the pandemic is not sustainable indefinitely. Of more concern is how removing or limiting free testing will affect the number of people staying home when infected to reduce the spread. It will also affect whether we will have sufficient early warning of changes in infection patterns, for example detecting the emergence of new variants of concern. These warnings are essential to mitigate future waves of infection. A more sensible approach would be to make free tests available in particular situations, such as when visiting hospitals or care facilities and for staff working in environments where being infectious could have serious consequences. Indeed, this is more appropriate than mandatory vaccination for healthcare staff, given that the vaccine does not always prevent infection. Population surveillance for emerging variants and to gauge overall levels of community infection can also be done through wastewater testing. As the virus passes through our body and is excreted, it can be detected at testing points in the sewer system. The Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection programme, part of NHS Test and Trace, has been doing this to map emerging spikes of infection, and gathering genomic sequence data to identify variants of interest or concern. This also provides anonymised evaluation of Covid levels in communities – no one has to submit to testing individually. I hope that we will see a tailored approach to testing in the future, rather than an all or nothing approach. We need to cautiously ease ourselves into living a relatively normal life with Covid. I would not rush into these final release measures until March, ideally when case numbers decline even further, and when we are emerging from winter. I would encourage further testing, but in a targeted manner to protect those with extreme vulnerability, and encourage surveillance through wastewater testing so that we can have early warning of changes in the situation. The removal of legal isolation requirements is a reasonable progression, but hopefully it will still be supported by guidance to isolate. This needs to stipulate that those feeling unwell should avoid crowds, educational, social or workplace mixing and employers should support those who withdraw from mixing while unwell. Given the lack of incentives for those on low pay or zero-hours contracts to stay home though, I suspect many will continue with work and potentially put others at risk. We have to ask: how big is this risk? Given the sheer number of Omicron infections, most of the population is probably now protected (until a new variant emerges). So I doubt we will see a huge upturn in infections. However, we will probably see a slower decline in cases than we would with stronger policy. Changes to guidance and testing should wait until March, when we are more likely to open windows and start to be outside more. I urge caution. Let’s not rush into a full release again and keep doing all we can to keep people as safe as possible.

2/19/2022,"Alexander Lukashenko may join Vladimir Putin at strategic nuclear drills, one day after offering to host nuclear weapons in Belarus to “defend our country”. The annual strategic Grom drills will take place on Saturday “under the supervision of Russian armed forces supreme commander-in-chief, Vladimir Putin”, Russia’s defence ministry has said in a statement. “Ballistic and cruise missiles will be launched in its course.”  Western countries remain concerned over Russia’s troop buildup on the Ukraine border. Russia has deployed up to 30,000 soldiers, tanks, artillery and ballistic missile systems to Belarus for joint exercises. At a Kremlin summit on Friday, Putin said that he and Lukashenko, who met the Russian president at a much closer proximity than German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, this week, would be attending a “major military cooperation event” on Saturday. “We’re going to be at an interesting event tomorrow,” Lukashenko said while discussing ongoing military exercises. “And we’ll be participating,” Putin interjected. “We’ll actively take part.” The Kremlin did not confirm whether they meant the nuclear drills, saying only: “If they decide to be there together, then they will be there together.” The surprise announcement came as the two men were expected to discuss the fate of the Russian troops sent to the Allied Resolve military training exercises concluding on Saturday. Western officials have warned that the military drills in Belarus could be cover for preparations for an invasion of Ukraine and a possible attack on Kyiv. Another option is that Russia could leave its troops in Belarus, creating a permanent threat on Ukraine’s border. Satellite imagery has shown Russian armour and artillery within miles of the Belarus border with Ukraine, and western officials have pointed out unusual military activity such as the construction of a pontoon bridge over the Pripyat river in the Chernobyl exclusion zone. Russian officials have pledged that the troops will leave Belarus after the exercises conclude. But in contradictory remarks, Lukashenko on Thursday said: “If it makes sense to keep Russian troops here, we will keep them as long as necessary. I emphasise once again: this is our territory and this decision is up to us.” Lukashenko also said that he would be ready to host Russian nuclear weapons “in order to defend our territory”. He has also said he wants to obtain Russian Iskander missile systems that could deliver strikes against countries in Europe. Moscow has so far agreed to neither. Permanently stationing Russian troops in the country would be a controversial decision in Belarus. Many Belarusians, even supporters of Lukashenko, do not want to see further integration with Russia and would view a large Russian military presence as an occupation. Lukashenko has resisted efforts to integrate his economy and politics with Russia under a union state plan but increasingly needs Russia’s financial and diplomatic support in his own standoff with the west. The Russian troops in Belarus are some of the most concerning to western analysts because they have been sent thousands of miles from Russia’s eastern military district. Thomas Bullock, a senior analyst at the defence intelligence provider Janes, said that the troops were among the Russian units that would have to withdraw in order for Russia to meaningfully decrease tensions. “You want to see those long-distance journeys being pulled back,” he said. Rochan Consulting has estimated that Russia has sent 50-70% of the eastern military district’s combat potential to Belarus. Units include armour, artillery, Spetsnaz special forces, engineering brigades, Iskander ballistic missile battalions, SU-35 fighters, paratroopers and anti-aircraft systems. Western governments had warned that Russia was planning to hold the strategic nuclear drills this month, rather than in late summer as is customary. The Russian drills would “involve forces and hardware belonging to the aerospace forces, the southern military district, the strategic missile forces, the northern fleet, and the Black Sea fleet”, the defence ministry said. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that Putin would take part in the exercise from a defence ministry operations centre. “Even test launches of this type are impossible without the head of state,” he told reporters. “You all know about his famed ‘black briefcase’, ‘the red button’ and so on.” The exercise would “check the preparedness of military commands and crews of missile systems, warships and strategic bombers to accomplish their missions and at verifying the reliability of weapons of strategic nuclear and conventional forces”, the ministry said.",News/World news,Belarus leader expected to join Putin for strategic nuclear drills,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/18/putin-lukashenko-actively-take-part-strategic-nuclear-drill-belarus-president-russian-ballistic-cruise-missile-launched

In the wake of Andrew settling the sexual assault case filed against him by Virginia Giuffre, and cash-for-honours allegations linked to Charles’s charity, actors playing the duke and future king will escort visitors onboard the Dungeon’s Tyrant Boat Ride.  They will first be taken to “face King Henry VIII’s royal wrath” at the Tower of London – marking the first time the Dungeon has sentenced modern figures to the tower. According to a release by the South Bank attraction, guests on the ride would usually join Anne Boleyn on her final journey along the Thames to Traitors’ Gate after being sentenced by Henry VIII. On the journey, they “meet their fate while facing intense darkness, choppy waters, scurries of rats and the foul stench of sewage – but for this weekend only London’s darkest history has been given a modern twist”. A spokesperson for the London Dungeon said: “If we can learn anything from history, it’s that very naughty princes should be sent straight to the tower. In the absence of Her Majesty, the London Dungeon has taken it upon itself to task Henry VIII, a monarch famous for his liberal use of the tower, to teach these two a valuable lesson.” It is not the first time the London Dungeon has drawn inspiration from rolling news coverage.

2/19/2022,"Southampton are reaping the rewards for keeping faith with Ralph Hasenhüttl after a sluggish start to the season. One defeat in their past 10 matches in all competitions has lifted them into the top half of the Premier League and through to the fifth round of the FA Cup.
