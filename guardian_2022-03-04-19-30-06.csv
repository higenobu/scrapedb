3/4/2022,"A lawyer described by her family as a “truly kind soul” has become the eighth cyclist to be killed on or near a notoriously dangerous gyratory in central London since 2008. Shatha Ali died after a collision involving a lorry near Holborn station on Tuesday morning as she battled her way through commuter traffic at the height of the tube strike. The death of Ali, 39, has put the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, under intense pressure to do more to protect cyclists on the multi-lane road, one of the capital’s busiest cycling commuting corridors. Plans by Transport for London (TfL) to introduce safety improvements at the gyratory were postponed after the transport body ran out of funds. Ali’s father, Hasan Ali, said: “She was extremely generous and contributed to many, many charities. She had very good, close friends. “She was everybody’s ‘go to’ person. We always depended on her. She travelled to so many places,” he added. “Last weekend she was hiking with her sister.” The former corporate city lawyer was a “social cyclist”, her family said, who knew London’s roads well, but the type of cyclist who would have ridden in jeans and a jumper rather than Lycra. Ali, who was born in the UK and grew up in London, graduated with a law degree from King’s College London in 2003. She obtained her postgraduate law degree from BPP Law School a year later. Ali worked for Norton and Rose, now international law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, before moving to Latham & Watkins in about 2012-13, where she was part of their corporate department as an expert on derivatives and Islamic finance. She rose to become a partner but left last summer to take a career break. She had a younger brother and sister and lived in Rotherhithe, south-east London. Speaking to the Evening Standard, her family said that despite a highly successful career, Ali had many interests outside of work. “She did very well, extremely well, at work, but that was not the focus of her life,” they said. Dr Ala’a al Shehabi, a childhood friend of Ali’s and a lecturer at University College London, tweeted: “Shatha should not have died in this horrific way.” “Absolutely devastated to hear the tragic news that my childhood friend Shatha Ali was killed in a horrific accident by a lorry last night in the notorious Holborn junction,” she added. “@SadiqKhan why haven’t you done anything to protect cyclists there?” Keera Mesh, another childhood friend, tweeted: “She was honestly the kindest person.” Last September, a left-turning lorry at the same gyratory claimed the life of the consultant paediatrician Dr Marta Krawiec, who was 41. Krawiec had been cycling to work at St Thomas’s hospital at the time. She had started commuting by bike at the start of the pandemic to ensure she could continue to see her patients and to “selflessly” keep space on the tube and buses free for other NHS workers. London Cycling Campaign, which is demanding safety improvements, is planning a vigil for 6pm on Friday. Simon Munk, the campaigns manager at LCC, said: “Just months from our last protest at Holborn, following the death of Dr Marta Krawiec, we are forced to return to this area and to junctions known for decades to be lethally dangerous to those walking and cycling, but where year after year nothing is done.” ",News/UK news,Lawyer is eighth cyclist to die at notorious London junction,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/04/lawyer-is-eighth-cyclist-to-die-at-notorious-london-junction-holborn-station
3/4/2022,"The superhero parentFor many parents, hybrid working hasn’t been the time-freeing salve they’d hoped for. Yes, working from home may have resulted in less late pickup fees from the nursery, but it’s also seen parents beavering away at all hours of the day; confused colleagues frequently receive emails from them at 11.44pm and 6.45am. These sapped-out mums and dads also spend most remote meetings on mute with one eye anxiously trained on the door, fearing their video call might be screen-bombed by the cochlea-perforating din of their little tykes at any minute. Observing the juggle has given more than a few child-free colleagues serious food for thought. The webcam refusenikIn the before times, this person was a consummate presentation giver, riffing their way through proposals and decks with all the oratorical flair of an Obama. But for some reason they haven’t taken to the virtual world quite so swimmingly. Maybe it’s the unforgiving camera angles, the demoralising exhaustion of back-to-back calls, or they’re just tired of staring at their own face for two years straight, but the instant the green light on their webcam flickers they switch it off and fade to black. Everyone else tries not to take this personally. The office evangelistWhen the lockdowns reached their zenith during 2020-21, this cubicle-championing colleague was missing the workplace so much they scented their home with an Eau d’Office candle while listening to keyboard-clacking on a specially created soundtrack called Sounds of Colleagues. Now, as work has gone hybrid, they’re back in the office five days a week, bounding from desk to desk, bemoaning homeworking as being detrimental to “office culture”. For them, the office is a second home; an invigorating place full of neverending Colin the Caterpillar cakes and the comforting hum of the air purifying system. Put a futon by their computer and they’d sleep there if they could. The teleworking technophobeIt’s been two years since the pandemic hit, yet the teleworking technophobe is still struggling with their tech. During virtual meetings, the group chat – unavailable to teleworking technophobes because they’re still unable to locate the chat tab – is alight with co-workers wisecracking about their wince-inducing lighting, the fact their face fills the entire screen like a dinner plate, and last year’s annual general meeting when they became a meme after getting stuck in a video filter that turned them into a talking pizza. Sadly, the hotdesking and huddle rooms of the new hybrid-reconfigured workplace is proving to be equally befuddling. IT has stopped taking their calls. The smug stay-at-homerThe smug stay-at-homer is lying low in the hope they won’t have to return to the office – even if it’s only for two days a week. And no wonder – whenever they dial into meetings, it’s from their new high-spec “shoffice”, with their pandemic-purchased spoils behind them (cocktail trolley, gold-plated exercise bike; not commuting has saved them so much money). No amount of free coffee or away days to the local abseiling centre will ever lure them back. Team Tuesdays to ThursdaysThese colleagues think they’ve got hybrid office life hacked. No more Blue Monday commutes or long Friday afternoons, waiting for the clock to strike 5pm for them; they now work a 3:2 timetable, and have ensured their mandatory three days in the office span Tuesdays to Thursdays, bagging them what they like to think of as a four-day weekend. Working nine to five never felt so good. The bewildered first-jobbersThey entered the world of work during lockdown, and it was months before they saw any of their colleagues from the neck down. Now, they’re in the office for the first time, and it’s a shock to the system. They spent their first morning gawping at their lanyards like a caveman staring at a smartphone. Since then, they’ve drifted aimlessly around the workspace looking as if they’ve just tumbled out of a time machine, wondering why some people actively choose to sardine themselves into public transport for two hours, only to spend the day making copious hot drinks and having endless “thermo-spats” about office temperature.

3/4/2022,"Slugs and snails will no longer be classed as pests by the Royal Horticultural Society, despite their reputation as a garden menace. Britain’s leading garden charity says that although the gastropods are the garden visitor about which they receive most complaints, they should be considered an important part of the garden ecosystem. In fact, the slimy creatures are misunderstood, as only nine of the 44 recognised species of slug in the UK eat garden plants, according to research by the RHS. They also “play an important role in planet friendly gardening and maintaining a healthy ecosystem”, according to the charity’s principal entomologist, Andrew Salisbury. Slugs are nature’s recyclers according to the RHS, clearing dead matter from the garden, and are also important food for more beloved garden guests including hedgehogs and birds. Some species even get rid of algae from greenhouses. In instances where slugs cause unwanted damage to plants, more “ethical” modes of intervention have been advised by scientists at the organisation. This could include using mulch, or planting species the slugs prefer to eat near prized blooms to attract them to those plants instead. Salisbury said: “The RHS is all too aware of the role that gardens have in supporting biodiversity and as such will no longer label any garden wildlife as ‘pests’. Instead, there will be greater consideration of and focus on the role that slugs, aphids and caterpillars play in a balanced garden ecosystem along with more popular wildlife (or animals) such as birds, hedgehogs and frogs.” The charity will be trying to do “positive PR” for invertebrates, including aphids, ants and ladybirds, which have tended to be destroyed in gardens in recent decades – often under the advice of garden experts. Their entomologists will also remind gardeners that maligned insects such as wasps eat flies, aphids and caterpillars, which can cause problems in gardens, so should be welcomed. Although many fear earwigs, these also reduce aphid numbers. Caterpillars are vital food for birds; blue tits, for example, hatch when caterpillars are at their most numerous. In a comment piece for the Guardian, Salisbury adds: “We are never going to eliminate slugs, aphids, caterpillars and other plant-munching invertebrates from our gardens – their existence after all predates the garden itself – and our plots are all the more lively and valuable because of them. “Amid the climate and biodiversity emergencies, now is the time to gracefully accept, even actively encourage, more of this life into our gardens.” This is a big departure for the RHS, which each year releases a list of “top garden pests” complained about by their members. Instead, the charity will now focus more on the threats to gardens posed by invasive species and climate change. Many invasive species and plant diseases thrive in milder, wetter climates, especially if there is not much winter frost to kill them off. This is the climate the UK is currently moving towards, according to scientists. Chelsea flower show, which is run by the RHS, last year featured many biodiversity-themed gardens, as designers had a more relaxed attitude to neatness and planting. Gardens at the event contained plants commonly thought of as weeds, and piles of dead wood to attract wildlife.",News/Environment,‘Planet friendly’: RHS to no longer class slugs and snails as pests,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/04/planet-friendly-rhs-to-no-longer-class-slugs-and-snails-as-pests
3/4/2022,"These days, remote meetings are part of the fabric of our working lives. From giving us the “business on top, pyjamas on the bottom” dress code to enabling that dream relocation to Mallorca (or Margate), the new era of video conferencing has helped us balance work and life better than ever before. But while hybrid working is endlessly flexible, people usually aren’t. Factor in clunky, unreliable tech and suddenly everyone’s cringing faster than you can say … er, nothing. Because you’re on mute again. Whatever your profession, chances are your video conferences go a little bit like this … Stage one: staring at your own faceFirst, the urgent business. We all know that nothing can be achieved on any video call until everyone has taken a good, long look at their own face. Really it should be the first item tabled on the agenda. But without that luxury, you are doomed to spending the first five minutes of every meeting pretending to pay attention while really contemplating your best angles, subtly attempting to sort out a chaotic fringe and pondering the eternal question: is that really what my eyebrows look like? Of course, the savvy hybrid worker always joins the call a few minutes early – officially, to look organised, but really so you have a chance to tweak the blinds to their most flattering angle, or haul a desk lamp in from another room and angle it straight at your face. This will work wonderfully until the sun begins to set outside, leaving you ghoulishly uplit as though telling a campfire ghost story. Boo. Stage two: sorry, didn’t catch thatLike proverbial buses, you wait ages for someone to kick things off and then three people speak at once. Even those of us who pride ourselves on not having suffered a “you’re on mute” moment since late 2020 can’t say we never fall victim to the mortifying “You go”, “No, after you”, “I’ve forgotten what I was saying anyway” exchange of doom, followed by awkward laughter and subsequent silence. Everyone will nod and make non-committal “agreeing” noises. Nobody knows what they’ve agreed to, and will later find out in a startling email. Stage three: the big freezeOnce you’ve all remastered the art of conversation, there’s the small matter of trying to look at the person who’s speaking, while they duck in and out of squares like the world’s worst Brady Bunch reboot. Wait, there they are! Nope, gone again. It doesn’t help that your colleagues include the Gesticulator, who keeps bobbing out of shot because their passionate body language can’t be contained within one small square, the Nostril, who seems to have confused this meeting with a medical examination, and the Jack in the Box, who can’t stay seated for longer than a couple of minutes without springing up to adjust the curtains, fetch a snack, or answer the door to the postman. Not forgetting the Iceberg, who freezes so often on screen that you begin to wonder if they’re moonlighting as a human statue. Stage four: the special guest appearanceYou could have sworn you switched your camera off – and yet the colleague who just messaged to say that they’d seen your partner/housemate/parent sneak across the room in a towel would suggest otherwise. While cameos from cute cats and dogs have become an accepted (and often welcome) part of the home working experience, not all cohabitants are as welcome. Stage five: the soundtrackIt is a universal truth that the otherwise silent, peaceful couple next door will choose your very important work call as the perfect time to start primal scream therapy, or perhaps clog dancing. The neighbourhood dogs will begin their daily choir practice just as you reach the most nerve-racking point of a pitch, while the builders across the street will helpfully finish their tea and begin their schedule of high-pitched drilling just in time for your client’s questions. Background noise is an unavoidable fact of hybrid working, but it doesn’t mean we should have to get distracted every ti … hang on, was that your doorbell? Or my doorbell? Shall we all go and answer our doors, just in case? Stage six: the fidgetsStage six is the most painful stage of video conferencing, being that it involves muscle cramp. You’ve now been perched on an unsuitable chair at an uncomfortable angle for 45 minutes, trying to look alert while keeping your face in the light and strategically blocking the pile of laundry on the floor behind you, dreaming of the moment you can finally get up and stretch your legs. Are you wincing at their budget projections, or because you’re trying to surreptitiously shake out a bad case of pins and needles? They’ll never know. Stage seven: the bad byeFinally, it’s time to wrap things up. Aims and objectives have been met and to-do lists have been ticked off. Any other business? Ah, yes, of course – the incredibly awkward wave. You try to suppress it. You clutch your mug of cold coffee in an effort to ride out the urge. But resistance is futile, and so after the traditional farewell of five byeees per person (six, for luck), up pops your hand and soon you’re flapping it around like a gameshow contestant. We can’t entirely blame video conferencing for this so much as the faulty connection between brain and arm, but at least you can take comfort in the fact that everyone else on the call is waving like an idiot, too. Great work today, team. News flash! Video conferencing needn’t be a painful experience – you just need the right tech for the job.

3/4/2022,"Inject the office with the best bits of remote working …During the lockdowns of 2020-21, many homeworkers discovered the joys of a daily park perambulation; in fact, those working from home were more likely to visit a park or local green space than those who travelled to work (45% compared with 30%), according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). It’s worth keeping up the flâneuring: incorporating an oxygen-soaked and nature-connecting passeggiata into your daily lunch hour has all sorts of health benefits – from boosting concentration and improving sleep quality to reducing the risk of arthritis and chronic back pain. Going for a stroll doesn’t need to be limited to lunchtimes either. According to a study from Stanford University, walking increases creative output by an average of 60%. And in fact, in a bid to combat video-call fatigue, one of the big four accountancy firms now encourages staff to take meetings during an outdoor walk where possible. … and replace bad homeworking habits with workplace disciplinesThe rise in homeworking hasn’t been the work-life balance panacea many hoped for. According to a study last year, British homeworkers typically log on for 11 hours a day – up from nine hours before the pandemic. If remote working leaves you struggling to set boundaries between work and home life, then make sure you log off at the same time you normally would in the office. Having nobody to talk to for hours on end can lead to many homeworkers feeling isolated – a recent study by the NatCen Social Research found that those who work from home experience a notable increase in loneliness. On days when you work from home, consider taking your computer to a co-working space or coffee shop, or meeting a local friend or colleague for a mood-boosting screen break. Make your presence known, no matter where you areThe move to remote working means many of the traditional modes of casual office communication – such as Monday morning catch-ups by the coffee machine and Friday afternoon pints down the pub – are now but a distant memory. If you’re one of millions of workers who now only sees their boss through a screen, it could be worth thinking about how you can enhance your profile. Yes, we’re talking self-branding. Sending your manager a regular weekly or monthly email summarising what you’re doing and flagging any key achievements is a simple yet effective way to toot your own horn. It’s also worth making sure your tech is supporting you to the max, so you can be clearly seen and heard, whether you’re in the boardroom or at your kitchen table. Speaking of which … Ensure your tech is up to the jobIf your pre-pandemic tech isn’t fit for hybrid work, you’re not alone. Poor-quality microphones and speakers can make even the snappiest of sales pitches sound muffled and stilted, while noughties-era webcams can make it impossible to put a face to the name. We all know that clear communication matters, so if you feel that your current tech is standing in your way, it’s worth speaking to your boss or IT department. For extra brownie points, point them in the direction of HP Presence. A customisable package of tech – including meeting room equipment for the office, and PCs and laptops for remote workers – HP Presence has been designed to make sure everyone can be seen, heard and share their ideas, no matter where they are. We’re talking enhanced camera technology, picture-in-picture and speaker tracking, and automatic light adjustment – so you’ll always be able to present your best self, even if you’re sitting in your badly-lit spare room. Meanwhile, sound levelling and AI noise cancellation mean you’ll be heard crystal clear – even if your kids/neighbours/pets are creating a racket in the background. Basically, with HP Presence, your team will once again be able to communicate as if you’re all in the same room … even if half of you are secretly still dressed for bed from the waist down. Show up for new staffUnder a hybrid work environment, people at the beginning of their careers and new starters may feel they’re missing out on the full workplace experience and even landmark career moments. From in-person training and support to peer-to-peer networking, the prevalence of working from home has changed the landscape of a nine to five. One way to boost meaningful inter-colleague interactions is to set up a reverse mentoring scheme – which pairs senior staff with their less experienced colleagues. The beauty is, it works both ways, with everyone involved learning new skills, ways of working – and almost certainly, acronyms. Elevate your hybrid working experience with HP Presence – a more human collaboration solution.

3/4/2022,"Outlander isn’t a show that can be described in a nutshell. Is it a period drama? Sci-fi? Action? Romance? Caitríona Balfe, who has been the show’s star for eight years, still doesn’t know. “God, yeah,” she puffs. “It sort of defies definition, but that’s part of the appeal.” One thing agreed upon among fans is that, against a dedicated attention to historical detail and endless panoramic shots of Scotland, Balfe’s raunchy relationship with co-star Sam Heughan is the beating heart of the story. Heughan, however, insists it’s not just constant shagging: “When it’s written off as a ‘bodice-ripping drama’ I think, ‘But there’s so much more to it.’” The adaptation of Diana Gabaldon’s novel series follows the story of second world war nurse Claire, played by Balfe, who is honeymooning with her husband, Frank, when she touches a stone in the Highlands and falls back in time to 18th-century Scotland. There, she falls in love with clansman Jamie, played by Heughan. He affectionately calls her “sassenach” – gaelic for “English outlander”. Together, they travel around the world, encountering and often disrupting historical events, moving back and forth between centuries, going into battle, saving lives, dealing with witchcraft trials, becoming a power couple and having a lot of sex. Claire is gutsy, liberated and, rather conveniently for the risky situations she constantly finds herself in, has an encyclopaedic knowledge. One day she is showing Jamie the marvels of bikini waxing, the next she is casually inventing penicillin. Jamie, meanwhile, becomes the surprise feminist ally we never knew existed in 1743 – a true leader on the battlefield, he is proud and stubborn but kind-hearted, and often assumes the beta role in his marriage. After a two-year “droughtlander” (that’s what fans call the excruciating time between seasons) the sixth season starts this week. Claire and Jamie are settling into life at Fraser Ridge in North Carolina with their grownup daughter Brianna and her family, as the Revolutionary war looms. It opens with a flashback to Ardsmuir Prison in 1753, where Jamie was imprisoned after the Battle of Culloden, and we are introduced to his nemesis Tom Christie. Fast forward to life at the ridge, and Christie arrives with his son and daughter, armed with memories of their time in prison and bound to cause more trouble than the war. There’s a lot of doom and gloom, with the leads reaching their 60s somewhat unconvincingly – the makeup department give Balfe exactly three grey hairs, while wardrobe hand Heughan a pair of reading glasses to pop on now and again. But sex is still the driving force of the show, and libidos are as high as a tossed caber. “Nobody takes their clothes off and has sex after 40?” laughs Balfe. “That’s just not the case. I love the letters I’ve got from fans in their 70s and 80s who talk about their vibrant sex lives. Brilliant – I’m glad I’ve got that to look forward to. It’s important that we honour the core sexual connection between Jamie and Claire and continue to have it.” Heughan agrees: “I want to believe that people can still be in love after being married for 20 or 30 years. They are ageing, it’s not quite as intense as when they first met, but the spark is still there.” There is, however, a more troubling side to Outlander’s use of sex. The show has always garnered attention – and criticism – for its repeated use of sexual assault; every member of the Fraser family has been brutally raped, as have other supporting characters including Fergus – who was a child. The last time we saw Claire and Jamie on screen was the controversial season five finale, in which Claire was raped by kidnappers. Throughout the divisive episode, we saw her dissociate from what was happening by escaping in dreamlike sequences with her loved ones. “We didn’t give power or weight to the attackers so you never see their faces,” says Balfe. “I thought we handled it respectfully and showed the dissociation a lot of people experience.” Even as a superfan, this sits uncomfortably. Is this gratuitous, or lazy writing? Or is it important to acknowledge the times they were in? “We have to listen to the criticism and we maybe haven’t always gotten it right,” says Balfe. “We do try to handle it as sensitively as possible. I don’t think you can pretend these things don’t happen, especially when you go back to the not-too-distant past.” Rape, she says, “was used as a weapon against women and people without a voice. In the UK today, the instances of rape prosecutions have dropped significantly. It’s disgusting. If our show can bring a conversation about them, that’s a good thing.” Heughan, who was tortured and raped at the end of season one, sees the feedback as an observation rather than a criticism. Referring to a scene in the early days, where Jamie thinks it’s normal to punish Claire with a few belt lashes during a fight, he says: “Outlander has never looked away from these things – we’ve always explored it. It is a pretty tough show to watch sometimes, and to act in, but we’ve always tried to be very careful to protect our fellow cast members and understand the issues involved.” Outside Outlander, Balfe recently missed out on an Oscar nomination for her performance in Kenneth Brannagh’s Belfast, while Heughan appeared alongside Keeley Hawes in last year’s Roald Dahl biopic To Olivia. After working on the show together for so long, and with the end nowhere in sight (Gabaldon has just released the 12th book) how do both actors feel about continuing to film on location in Scotland for up to 17 months a season? Heughan thinks this day job gives perspective when it comes to other projects, but the experience is perhaps different for Balfe, who became a mother last year: “Now that I’m responsible for somebody, it is nice to know that I have this amazing day job. As a new mum I don’t know how I’m going to do it but there are working mums all over so I’ll figure it out. But it is a challenge. It’s a beast of a show.” When the end does finally come, Heughan will feel “bereft”, while Balfe explains that 70% of the cast and crew have been there since the beginning. “Sam and I made a conscious decision at the start, ‘Who knows what this is going to be – but we have to have each other’s back. We’ve remained that way. We are lifelong friends.”  Outlander is back on Starzplay on Amazon Prime on 6 March.",Arts/Television & radio,‘Nobody has sex after 40?

3/4/2022,"America is divided. That’s not news. But the authoritarian ruler in the Kremlin deciding to invade a democratic neighbor – that’s the type of international crisis that traditionally might have inspired some closing of the ranks: set differences aside, let domestic quarrels rest. But conservatives are evidently out on the idea of patriotic unity. The right’s reactions to Russia’s attack on Ukraine have ranged from blatant admiration for Putin to anti-Russian saber-rattling combined with a shrill critique of President Joe Biden. Donald Trump initially called the invasion “genius”; he then defended his position at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) over the weekend, adding that Nato was “not so smart” and “our leaders are dumb.” Meanwhile, America’s most successful cable news host Tucker Carlson ridiculed American solidarity with Ukraine, a country he derided as “a tyranny,” led by “the people who paid off Joe Biden’s family.” Donald Trump is the political leader of the Republican party and likely its next presidential candidate. Tucker Carlson is one of the premier rightwing culture warriors in the country. Trump and Carlson are not fringe voices, and they aren’t outliers either: a last week’s CPAC, conservative speakers focused their ire on Joe Biden’s supposed weakness as the real cause for Putin’s aggression; and they left no doubt who they considered the biggest threat – the “enemy within,” as Senator Rick Scott put it, the “militant left-wing in our country.” It may feel shocking, but it shouldn’t be surprising that many Republican leaders and conservative elites think the American president is a more dangerous enemy than the Russian autocrat. There is an influential tradition on the right of idolizing Putin as a defender of white Christian values against the onslaught of secular, “leftist” liberalism. In 2013, for instance, Pat Buchanan, a leading voice on the “paleoconservative” traditionalist right, described Putin as “one of us,” an ally in what he saw as the defining struggle of our era, “with conservatives and traditionalists in every country arrayed against the militant secularism of a multicultural and transnational elite”. Similarly, in 2014, famous evangelist Franklin Graham lauded Putin for having “taken a stand to protect his nation’s children from the damaging effects of any gay and lesbian agenda” – an agenda Barack Obama was supposedly pursuing in the US. After the 2016 election, the simmering admiration for Putin morphed into GOP orthodoxy, with Donald Trump himself leading the Republican party’s pro-Russia turn. This rapprochement shaped the right well beyond conservative elites. Among voters in general, support for Donald Trump correlates strongly with a favorable opinion of Putin, and Americans who define the US as a “Christian nation” have a much more favorable view of Putin’s Russia. As recently as January 2022, Putin had a significantly higher approval rating among Republicans than Joe Biden. Such authoritarian, white Christian nationalist, anti-“left” leanings are now informing the right’s reaction to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The far right is all in on Putin – Steve Bannon, for instance, declared his support because “Putin ain’t woke, he is anti-woke.” On the Christian nationalist wing of the Republican party, Lauren Witzke, the Delaware Republican party’s candidate for Senate in 2020, proudly declared that she supported Putin because he protects “our Christian values. I identify more with Russian, with Putin’s Christian values than I do with Joe Biden.” Not to be outdone, Arizona state senator Wendy Rogers emphasized that “I stand with Christians worldwide and not the global bankers who are shoving godlessness and degeneracy in our face”; in case it wasn’t entirely clear whose side she was on, she added that Ukrainian president Zelenskiy, who is Jewish, was “a globalist puppet for Soros and the Clintons”. Tucker Carlson, finally, representative of a whole phalanx of rightwing media activists, boldly declared in the days before the invasion why his problem was not with Russia: “Has Putin ever called me a racist? Has he threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him?” The message was clear: the real threat was the “woke” cancel mob at home, not the staunch defender of Christian values abroad. Vladimir Putin understands his appeal to western reactionaries precisely. He likes to present himself as an ally in the fight against “wokeism”. In a much-publicized speech in October 2021, for instance, he attacked “cancel culture” and the west’s supposed obsession with trans rights, called the teaching of gender fluidity “on the verge of a crime against humanity”, railed against “reverse discrimination against the majority in the interests of minorities”, and emphasized his love for traditional “family values”. This speech, in particular, got Putin glowing reviews from conservative commentators and intellectuals. A telling example is Rod Dreher, senior editor at the American Conservative. Dreher is a leading figure on the religious right; certainly not moderate, but in good standing – and friends – with conservatives like Ross Douthat and David French who are widely respected and admired by liberals. Dreher is an interesting bellwether for the reactionary intellectual sphere: he is begrudgingly pro-Trump, because he is enthusiastically anti-liberal. “Putin, Orban, and all the illiberal leaders that our baizuocracy loves to hate are all completely clear and completely correct on the society-destroying nature of wokeness and post-liberal leftism,” Dreher mused a few months ago. And he has not been shy about his disdain for the west’s support for Ukraine: “I adamantly oppose risking the lives of boys from Louisiana and Alabama to make the Donbas safe for gender queers and migrants.” In other words, it’s not that Dreher wants to see Putin win, necessarily – he just shares his contempt for America’s “woke” culture. This critique has basically become dogma on the right: a radically “un-American” woke Left is out to destroy the country – and has already succeeded in undermining the nation considerably, especially its “woke, emasculated military,” as Texas senator Ted Cruz put it; a weak west foolishly “focused on expanding its national debt and exploding the gender binary”, according to rightwing activist Ben Shapiro. None of the conservatives and right wingers who are currently professing their sympathy for Putin seem to know much about Russia or care about the specific causes and dynamics of what is going on in Ukraine. What matters to them is an imagined Russia: a stronghold of white patriarchal Christianity, where men get to be real men. They also love how autocrats like Putin and Orbán glorify their nations’ past and forcefully push back against those cunning “globalists”. To western reactionaries, the imagined versions of “Russia” and “Hungary” have become models of how to organize society and deal with the real “leftist” enemy. The American right does not stand alone with its reaction to Putin’s invasion. Across the west, farright and reactionary movements have similarly oscillated between openly siding with Russia and condemning Putin while fully agreeing with his general critique. Rightwing politicians in Switzerland, conservative commentators in Germany, reactionary monarchists in the UK: wherever you look, the same diagnosis: the west had it coming, weakened by liberal decadence and “woke culture.” The transnational rightwing admiration for autocrats like Putin and Orbán is a crucial reminder that the struggle over democracy and multiracial pluralism is indeed playing out not just in the US, and that the reactionary counter-mobilization is an international phenomenon. It’s also why, conversely, right-wing movements across the world have been obsessed with Trump. They rejoiced in 2016, because they saw his election as proof that the forces of reaction would ultimately prevail. Trump, in this interpretation, was seen as evidence that any attempt to install multiracial pluralistic democracy would spark a backlash strong enough to defeat the nefarious forces of liberalism – Trump was supposed to stem the tide. In a way, the escalating obsession with foreign autocrats is a reaction to Trump’s failure to make good on that promise. If not Trump, then who? Reactionaries are looking elsewhere. Many, like Dreher, believe that Putin and Orbán have shown the way forward: “They grasp that this is a civilizational struggle, and that they are not just dealing with opponents, but with very powerful people who push an agenda that is tearing our societies apart.” Rightwingers everywhere understand the transnational dimension as well as the world-historic significance of the current fight over democracy more clearly than many people on the left: is it possible to establish a stable multiracial, pluralistic democracy? Such a political, social and cultural order has indeed never existed. There have been several stable, fairly liberal democracies – but either they have been culturally and ethnically homogeneous to begin with; or there has always been a pretty clearly defined ruling group: a white man’s democracy, a racial caste democracy, a “herrenvolk” democracy. A truly multiracial, pluralistic democracy in which an individual’s status was not determined to a significant degree by race, gender, or religion? I don’t think that’s ever been achieved anywhere. It’s a vision that reactionaries abhor – to them, it would be the end of “western civilization”. And they are determined to fight back by whatever means necessary.

3/4/2022,"Researchers at UK universities are bracing themselves for sanctions affecting science partnerships with Russia, including in climate science and space research, as the government seeks to isolate President Vladimir Putin over the invasion of Ukraine. Simon Marginson, a professor of higher education at the University of Oxford, said most academics would support a research boycott with heavy hearts and concerns for Russian colleagues. “All the Russian academics I know oppose the war. The internal situation in Russia will get nastier and they will need solidarity, so there is a case for maintaining ties,” he said. Germany announced that all collaboration with Russia on education and research was being halted immediately. Its ministry of education said Russia had “turned its back on the international community” by invading Ukraine and was committing a “grave breach of international law” with no justification. This week George Freeman, the UK science minister, said he had ordered “a rapid review” of all Russian beneficiaries of UK science and technology funding. Experts say possible sanctions could include a ban on British academics collaborating with Russian scientists, the freezing of any joint funding, and the exclusion of Russian scientists from reading or publishing in international scientific journals. Prof Colin Riordan, the vice-chancellor of Cardiff University, a member of the prestigious Russell Group, said some Cardiff academics had withdrawn from events in Russia of their own accord. If the government were to tell his university to cut ties with Russia, it would do so because of the “bigger things at stake”. But he said the government should be careful about any blanket ruling banning all collaboration with Russian academics. “We need to distinguish between the government and citizens of Russia who find themselves in an extremely difficult position,” he said. Prof Steve West, the president of the vice-chancellors’ group Universities UK, told the Guardian: “I think we have to expect science sanctions. The position of universities is always that scientific collaboration and research are a vital global endeavour. However, what is happening is a challenge on democracy and the safety and stability of the free world.” Academics in Russia, thousands of whom have signed open letters opposing the war, say their international relationships are fracturing. They say academics from across Europe are cancelling trips and pulling out of partnerships. Almost 4,000 academics, students and graduates of the prestigious Moscow State University, Russia’s oldest university, have signed a letter saying they “categorically condemn the war that our country unleashed in Ukraine”. The letter says: “There is no room for euphemisms or excuses. War is violence, cruelty, death, loss of loved ones, powerlessness and fear that cannot be justified by any goal.” Another condemnatory open letter on Thursday had been signed by more than 15,000 Russian academics and students. A senior Russian scientist, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, said some science leaders had been accused of “betraying the motherland” by speaking out against the war. Many were afraid to sign the letters because of a “culture of fear”. “People in the west do not fully understand the pain we feel,” he said. “It is like England invading Scotland. Many of us have relatives in Ukraine or were born there.” He said he knew academics in Russia who had written privately to research partners in the UK and other countries, stressing that they did not support the invasion of Ukraine, and expressing hope that they might find a way of continuing to work together. A Russian scientist in St Petersburg, who said he had been chased by riot police this week, tweeted: “I’m so disgusted with rejection letters, invitation cancellations, grant withdrawals against Russian scholars from Western academics who fight Putinism by attacking those who have suffered from it for decades.” A Russian climate scientist based at a leading Russell Group university in the UK, speaking on condition of anonymity, said his field work, which was based in Russia and involved Russian scientists in different disciplines, looked likely to grind to a halt. A joint expedition he had been planning with colleagues in Moscow has been cancelled. “Russia is such a huge territory and we will lose so much empirical data. This will be a really big blow for climate science.” The scientist, who said he was “appalled and devastated” by the invasion of Ukraine, added: “The majority of academics in Russia are not fans of the current regime, and of course sanctions will strike right at them.” Paul Nightingale, a professor of strategy at Sussex’s University’s science policy research unit, said measures should be adopted that would “be brutal and would achieve the aim of turning more people against Putin”. In addition to curbs on collaboration and publishing, Britain and the US could consider offering five-year working visas to every Russian with a PhD, he said, to prompt a brain drain from the country, although he added that this could damage hopes of Russia becoming a more liberal society in the future. Nightingale, formerly a director of special projects at the UK government’s Economic and Social Research Council, said he was in favour of sanctions to isolate Putin in the coming weeks, but they must be imposed carefully to avoid killing the possibility of useful academic diplomacy. “Even during the worst of the cold war, American, European and Russian scientists would work together on important problems,” he said. “Those social networks provided really important back channels for communication. “Unfortunately the people we would be hurting most in trying to damage Putin would be our friends.” Prof Isak Froumin, the head of the Institute of Education at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, said global science had been very important to Putin’s regime. Until 2018 the Russian government was pushing universities hard to play more of a role in global science by collaborating with researchers abroad and publishing in international journals, he said. “International collaboration in science was considered absolutely necessary and prestigious.” He added: “The idea that might be all broken is a great shock to scientists.” Prof James Wilsdon, the director of the Research on Research Institute based at Sheffield University, said the UK government was likely to focus sanctions on areas with strategic security implications for Russia, including climate science in the arctic and space research. He warned that in the longer term ministers must be careful not to “choke off the good”. “Links in science are a very important part of maintaining what spark of freedom there is in Russia,” he said.",News/Education,UK universities brace for impact of sanctions against Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/04/uk-universities-impact-sanctions-russia-academmics-boycott
3/4/2022,"Poya Asbaghi was at Zurich airport waiting for a connecting flight to Stockholm from Barcelona when the then assistant manager of Dalkurd, a team founded by the Kurdish diaspora in the Swedish county of Dalarna, received a panicked call from the chairman. “He asked: ‘Where are you?’” says Asbaghi, now the head coach of Barnsley. “I told him I was in Switzerland and he said: ‘One of those planes from Barcelona has crashed.’ I didn’t know which plane but, of course, you start doing the maths. I understood that there was a bigger chance that some of our players were on that flight than not. We didn’t get to speak more before we had to go on our next flight. We were sitting on that flight just thinking about which players might have died, basically.” It was March 2015 and 29 players and staff were heading home from Spain after a training camp. There were four possible routes back, with varying stopovers. They were split across three flights, ignoring the cheapest option to avoid a 10-hour wait in Düsseldorf. Germanwings flight 4U9525 never made it that far, crashing into the French Alps and killing all 150 on board. “I was checking in with the Dutch schoolchildren in front of me and saw their happy faces – they were clapping hands with each other and playing – and a couple of hours later I heard that those people had died,” Asbaghi says. “It was not until we landed in Stockholm that we saw the whole team gathered and understood that we had survived. You almost felt ashamed to be alive.” It is a tale that will always provide Asbaghi with a dose of perspective. He also speaks eloquently about why his family fled Iran to avoid political persecution in the 1980s and openly about everything from quitting playing football as a teenager to study an economics degree and being inspired by Sven-Göran Eriksson to learning why his Barnsley players call the January deadline-day hit signing Amine Bassi “Shirley”, after the Welsh pop singer, and trying to locate his nearest padel court. “I tried to do a little bit of research,” Asbaghi says. “There are a few courts here and there but it has still not had its breakthrough in England. Maybe it will come. You are good at racket sports and you have some good tennis players, so why not?” Asbaghi was one when he and his parents settled in Uppsala, Sweden’s fourth-biggest city and the place he calls home. “Hearing the stories from my parents gives you a perspective of life. It teaches you to appreciate things that you maybe sometimes take for granted. When I grew up I got to hear more and more about the reasons why we left Iran. It is a beautiful country … but the climate of living in the country is not always as free as we in western Europe are used to. When you get to live in countries like Sweden or England we should be happy with the circumstances that we can grow up in, with a lot of freedom. It is something we have to appreciate because there are a lot of people in the world who unfortunately cannot say the same.” It is a rainy Wednesday at Oakwell but the previous day, Asbaghi says, was the first time he has not needed a warm jacket at training since arriving in November. Barnsley will hope to insulate further against relegation with a fourth victory in five matches at Derby on Saturday. “Hopefully we can have more of these days,” says Asbaghi, who took over when Barnsley were second-bottom in the Championship after eight defeats in nine matches. He had to wait almost three months to record his first victory but a win over Derby could hoist his side, who have a game in hand on Reading, to within three points of safety. Two years ago, under Gerhard Struber, Barnsley avoided dropping into the third tier after a stoppage-time winner at Brentford on the final day. “People said when I arrived that by March Barnsley would be relegated. A big objective for us is to have something to play for until the last round.” It is why Asbaghi, who was interviewed for the job before Struber took charge in 2019, stresses the importance of not tuning into outside noise. “After every win people will say that we might be able to stay in the league and after every loss people will say we will play in League One next season. We, as players and staff, cannot ride this emotional rollercoaster.” Asbaghi’s former club Dalkurd, where he went on to become the manager, now play in Sweden’s second tier. “After we won promotion to go up to the professional level, we went to a training camp in the Kurdish parts of Turkey and experienced how much the club meant for the people living there. Dalkurd was almost a national team that competed at club level. I think that is the art of sports. For example, when Dalkurd won a lot of games, people in Kurdistan could see their flag winning football games, and it somehow gave them hope also of living a better life. When you can do that for people just through doing well in sports, of course it gives you extra joy.” The 36-year-old is not one to scream or shout and he speaks warmly of Eriksson as a calm leader. Eriksson won the Uefa Cup with IFK Gothenburg in 1982 and Asbaghi led the club to the Swedish Cup in 2020 before taking charge of the country’s Under-21s. “I always try to pick details from the best coaches and make it into my own kind of salad. Sven is considered in Sweden by far the best coach we have had. Maybe he didn’t win the World Cup with England but I think he did pretty well. In the [2002] World Cup I remember he went to the quarter-finals against Brazil, when Ronaldinho scored that free-kick. That is the margins of football …” If Asbaghi requires a reminder of the bigger picture, it is never far away. “I still think about the people that tragically passed away,” he says. “It was just chance. A lot of us were on our way to being booked on that flight … Sometimes when you lose a game, those of us who work in football and also the fans think it is the end of the world because we put so much passion and hard work into it. But those experiences, just like we talked about the situation in Ukraine, give you a little bit more of a balanced perspective on life.”",Sport/Football,Barnsley’s Poya Asbaghi: ‘I still think about the people that died.

3/4/2022,"The snow was blowing sideways as the blizzard engulfed Rosebud Summit. Alone with her dog team more than 3,500ft up in Alaska’s forbidding White Mountains, then 21-year-old musher Apayauq Reitan struggled to find the trail during the 2019 Yukon Quest. “The only way for me to tell where it was was by walking in front of the team and sinking into the snow up to my hips,” said Reitan. This month, as she returns to the world of long-distance mushing, Reitan is poised to make history as the first out trans woman to compete in the Iditarod. But circumstances were very different when she faced Rosebud Summit three years ago. The exposed mountain summit is one of the hardest sections of the Quest, the 1,000-mile sled dog race through the wilderness of Alaska and Canada. Blizzards, plunging temperatures, dangerous animal encounters and sleepless nights are only a few of the obstacles competitors can face in one of the world’s toughest long-distance races. She was competing using her deadname and gender assigned at birth. Although she’d already come out to a few close friends, she hadn’t told her family yet. She grew up traveling between Narjordet, Norway, and the tiny Arctic coast village of Kaktovik, Alaska, which is home to about 250 people, and she was worried about how community members, mushers, and others would react. But she realized in her heart the time had come. “I knew that I couldn’t keep living in the closet,” she said. “I had to start living as my true self.” Back on the mountain, the trail had disappeared in the whiteout. Many of the reflective markers that lined the way had blown over as the wind gusted up to 60 mph. “I was really wet from the snow blowing, and from sweat from all the exertion and trying to find the trail,” said Reitan. “I would help [the dogs] pull the sled to get it moving, but then they would run faster than me and I would get tangled and fall in the line.” Her mother, Anguyak, was keeping a close eye on the online race tracker, which records the movements of the teams in real time. “I knew she was having a really hard time up there because I’d seen that little, tiny dog team moving this way and that way, and staying in one spot for a very long time,” Anguyak said. Reitan was exhausted. The dogs were tired. She knew she had to make a decision: quit or push on. “I was really considering pressing the button that would contact emergency services,” she said. “You have to be OK with quitting in terms of safety. But I was thinking, ‘I’ve come all this way.’” With the majority of the trail behind her, she had just 70 miles to go to reach the finish line, if she could only make it over the summit. She pulled her team off the trail and found a stand of willow trees which she hoped would offer protection. But the conditions were too severe for the spindly trunks to provide much of a barrier. The dogs nestled down in the deep snow and Reitan huddled in her sled as the wind howled around her. Exhaustion won out and she fell asleep, alone on the mountain. “When you’re out there, you have to rely on yourself,” said her father, Ketil. It was something Reitan had been doing internally for many years before coming out. Just like the snow-covered trail, her path to that point in time hadn’t always been smooth. She’d struggled as a teenager. She was shy and often kept to herself, spending lots of time alone in her room. “She didn’t really fit in and had some problems finishing school,” said Ketil. “I felt something was wrong and I was worried about her.” Looking back, Reitan remembered telling people in kindergarten that she was going to be a girl when she grew up. “But then, one day I looked in the mirror and thought, nobody’s telling me that this can be a thing. I can’t be a girl. So, I just repressed that thought for years,” she said. “Maybe my life would have been a lot different – maybe I would have avoided a lot of pain in my teenage years if I was told when I was a kid that I could change my gender.” Time stretched on atop Rosebud Summit. When she awoke, she was chilled to the bone. “Snow had blown into the sled and I was thinking, ‘If I don’t get moving now, I’m going to freeze,’” she said. She got up and roused the team. The conditions had improved a bit and her lead dogs could sniff out the trail. Soon, they were zipping down the mountain with the end in sight. “It’s just like if you have been to the top of Mount Everest,” said Ketil. “You don’t come back as the same person after having completed something like that.” She finished the race in 14th place. Her perseverance earned her the 2019 rookie of the year award, given to the first rookie to cross the finish line. Just weeks later, she and her dog team returned to the backcountry to compete in the 1,000-mile Iditarod, which they finished successfully, despite a broken sled and bad weather. With her goal met, she knew it was time to tell her family. “She seems much more content,” said Ketil. “That makes me happy to see that she’s happy.” She dropped her English name and started exclusively using her Iñupiaq name, which is gender neutral and which she shared with her great-grandmother. She also got her tavluġun, the Iñupiaq women’s chin tattoo. “She’s not afraid to do anything. Once she gets her mind to do something, she does it,” said Anguyak. “She’s a very strong person. I’m very proud of her to not be afraid to say what she really means or say who she is. It’s better to let it out than keep it in, I think, and I’m very proud.” Throughout the pandemic, she attended photography school in Trondheim, Norway, so her main connection with Alaska was online. On 8 March 2021 – International Women’s Day – she came out publicly on social media. Reactions were overwhelmingly supportive, including from fellow mushers who reached out, though she did notice a change in how some community members interacted with her. She said she knows it will just take time. “Being a trans woman is kind of like life on hard mode,” she said. But she’s no stranger to that. After the Iditarod, she plans to go back to Kaktovik to work and is considering pursuing a degree in Alaska Native studies in the future. The race is set to begin on 5 March. That means she’ll be mushing through the Alaska backcountry, adapting to all the trail has in store for her, on the one-year anniversary of her coming out to the world. “Part of the reason I decided to do the Iditarod again is to have an opportunity to show that you can be trans and do anything,” she said. “I want trans people who are in the closet to see that surprisingly different people can transition and be OK.” She recalled a night she was out with her dog team before she finished both races in the same year, before the blizzard on Rosebud Summit, and before she came out. It was a full moon night with thousands of stars glittering in the sky above. The only sounds were the whooshing of the sled along the quiet trail and the pitter-patter of the dogs’ paws in the snow. She looked up at the sky and felt at peace. “I’m a person and I’m with my dogs, and we’re all traveling together in this very particular way on this one planet, in this one solar system, and there’s all these stars,” she said. “And it’s so amazing to be a being that’s made of star stuff.”",Sport/Sport,‘Life on hard mode’: the first out trans woman competing in the Iditarod,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/04/iditarod-apayauq-reitan-first-out-trans-woman
3/4/2022,"In the face of imminent threats to legal abortion in the US, lawmakers and activists in left-leaning “blue” states are working to expand rights and access to the procedure. State-level efforts to protect the right to abortion and reduce the cost of obtaining the procedure in states such as California, Rhode Island and Vermont are, in large part, a response to a forthcoming supreme court decision which could gut abortion rights nationally. The landmark 1973 supreme court decision in Roe v Wade guaranteed pregnant people a constitutional right to obtain an abortion, invalidating dozens of state abortion bans that were in place at the time. However, many states never passed their own laws affirming a right to abortion. Now, the newly conservative-leaning US supreme court looks willing to gut the right to abortion as it prepares to decide on a new case, called Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization. A decision in the case is expected in June. If the court overturned Roe v Wade, it could return the issue of abortion to states, many of which have not updated their laws in decades or are actively hostile to abortion and are ready to enforce bans or severe restrictions. In the event the US supreme court reversed Roe v Wade, 26 states would be certain or likely to outlaw abortion, while just 15 states and Washington DC have laws to protect abortion rights. “Conservative legislators clearly feel they have the legal support to continue to pass abortion bans and restrictions,” said Elizabeth Nash, interim associate director of state issues at the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research center. Nash said researchers see “a real trend around abortion bans, including comprehensive and early bans”. “Part of the issue is we simply have fewer progressive state legislatures than we do conservative ones,” said Nash. However, she is optimistic about efforts to affirm abortion rights and expand access in progressive states. “Over the past several years we have seen more action in state legislatures to protect abortion rights than we had previously,” she said. “We look at 2019 – you had states from Illinois to Maine to Vermont and Rhode Island all looking to add statutory protections,” for abortion rights, momentum that has continued as threats to Roe v Wade have mounted. Right-leaning lawmakers have long used abortion to rally their base, while protections conferred by Roe v Wade meant abortion was often ranked as a low priority for left-leaning voters. As a result, abortion rights legislation has languished for decades, even as rightwing politicians passed hundreds of restrictions. Recent congressional efforts to codify the right to abortion in statute failed in the face of Republican opposition. Though the Democrat-led House of Representatives passed the Women’s Health Protection Act last year, which would have banned medically unnecessary restrictions on the procedure , the bill died in the Senate this week. The bill required 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. Democrats hold 50 seats, and Republicans universally opposed the measure. They were joined by one Democrat, Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia. “We should have codified Roe in state law around the country,” said Liana Cassar, a Democratic state representative in Rhode Island. “But there was a belief we weren’t at risk – we weren’t at risk of losing access to abortion.” That has changed since Donald Trump was able to confirm three justices to the supreme court, tipping the nine-member bench firmly to the right. Now, left-leaning lawmakers are seeking to pass more protections for abortion. New Jersey became the first state in the nation to pass an abortion-related law in 2022, affirming the right to terminate a pregnancy and ordering a study of the barriers low-income women face to obtain the procedure. In February, Vermont lawmakers voted to move forward on a constitutional amendment to guarantee the right to abortion and contraception. The measure – the first of its kind in the US – will appear on the ballot in November, and voters in the state are expected to approve it. Rhode Island affirmed a right to abortion in state law in 2019, but left in place restrictions that banned the state’s employee health insurance and Medicaid, a health insurance program for the poor and disabled, from paying pay for abortion. Lawmakers are now working to allow Medicaid to pay for abortions and other services. “This is a racism and a classism issue,” said Cassar, the sponsor of Rhode Island’s legislation. If passed, Rhode Island would join 15 other states that allow Medicaid to pay for abortions. In California, the Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, commissioned a Future of Abortion report, in part to examine the repercussions of abortion bans in neighboring states. If the US supreme court allows states to ban or severely restrict abortion, a recent Guttmacher report found the number of out-of-state people who could find the nearest clinic in California could increase from 46,000 to 1.4 million overnight – a nearly 3,000% increase. “Folks can fall into the thinking that advocacy, aggressive advocacy, to expand abortion access is not necessary,” said Onyemma C Obiekea, policy analyst for the Black Women for Wellness Action Project, a reproductive justice group which helped steer the Future of Abortion committee. However, potentially devastating supreme court rulings have, “really shifted that”. One of the first recommendations lawmakers are tackling from the report would aim to further protect California residents from the high cost of abortion. California’s Medicaid program already pays for abortions. A new bill would end out-of-pocket costs for people who seek abortions and have private insurance. That could reduce the cost of terminating a pregnancy by hundreds of dollars for about 9,600 of the 23,000 California women who seek abortions in the state each year, reducing the number of people who face high costs by 41%, according to the California Health Benefits Review Program. The bill would only impact people whose private health insurance is regulated by the state. The health insurance plans of about 5.7 million Californians are regulated by the federal government. Perhaps the most ambitious efforts to protect abortion rights are taking place in so-called “purple states” such as Michigan, where – like Vermont – a coalition of reproductive rights groups are pushing a ballot initiative to provide a right to abortion in the state’s constitution. Currently, if the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, it could allow a 1931 law banning abortion to be reinstated. To get a question on the 2022 ballot Michigan groups need to collect more than 425,000 signatures, according to the Detroit News. Michigan has Democratic governor but abortion rights legislation has no realistic chance of moving through the Republican-controlled statehouse, which prompted a drive to put the question to voters. The chances of the initiative succeeding are unclear. An initiative to legalize abortion in Michigan failed in 1972, just one year before Roe v Wade was decided. In all states, powerful opposition to efforts to expand abortion rights and access has come from Christian anti-abortion organizations, the Catholic church and aligned Republicans. In just one example, the Catholic church has been among the most vocal opposition to Cassar’s bill in Rhode Island. Even if more progressive states pass and expand access to abortion, millions people in states hostile to abortion would face insurmountable challenges to obtaining a legal abortion. This scenario is currently playing out in Texas, where state lawmakers have successfully enacted a law that bans abortion before most women know they are pregnant. States like California are just “too far away” for many of the people who live in conservative southern states that are most likely to pass harsh abortion bans, said Michelle Anderson, state organizer with the Texas-based and Black women-focused reproductive rights justice group the Afiya Center. “The bottom line is that abortion bans do not stop abortions,” said Anderson. “They just make abortions less safe, and this is especially true for Black women.”",News/US news,Blue states seek to protect abortion rights before supreme court decision,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/04/blue-states-abortion-rights-supreme-court

The promiseSalt spray – salty water – was responsible for that quintessential noughties hairstyle the “beachy wave”, so called because you looked like you’d been for a swim.

The testBumble & Bumble’s Surf Spray was the ultimate styling product of my youth for that dry, matte “fresh from the beach” texture – minus the rogue bits of seaweed. The plethora of DIY recipes online share a common base method. I start by half-filling an old face mist bottle with water, add a teaspoon of sea salt and shake. Spritzed on my dry, curly hair and scrunched with my hands it just made my hair feel crispy. Another recipe suggests adding aloe vera juice or gel to the mix: this softens the crisp a little, but still feels underwhelming. Swapping the aloe for hair gel, as another recipe suggests, adds a smidge more definition, though some strands are positively solid. In my final endeavour, I a few drops of jojoba oil to this formula. Sure, it softens the gel a little, but my hair is still so crispy it audibly “crunches” when I move.

3/4/2022,"My earliest reading memoryThe first books I remember reading were from the public library in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where my family came as refugees from Vietnam in 1975. I vividly recall Maurice Sendak’s Where the Wild Things Are, which I read at six years of age, but unlike most children, I didn’t like it. The story of a boy who flees home on a boat and finds himself among foreign creatures was too dark for me. Perhaps it was too close to reality. My favourite book growing upThe Tintin series by Hergé. The books were so beautifully drawn and told, with memorable characters and adventures in exotic lands. The stories were captivating.I loved the exoticism but didn’t notice the racism and colonialism. I’ve given the books to my eight-year-old son and he loves them, too, but I make sure we discuss the problems. The book that changed me as a teenagerAt 13 or 14, I read Philip Roth’s Portnoy’s Complaint. I sensed a similarity between my Vietnamese refugee world and Roth’s Jewish American world, but what really struck me was the moment when adolescent Alex Portnoy masturbates with a slab of liver. On finishing his dastardly deed, he puts the liver back in the fridge and his unsuspecting family dines on it that evening. I paid tribute to the scene in my novel The Sympathizer. Let’s just say a poor squid is involved. The writer who changed my mindAt 18, I came across Amy Tan’s The Joy Luck Club. I was so enraptured that I finished it in a couple of days. I didn’t know that Asian American literature existed before reading this book, but eventually I would write my own book on it, which dates to the late 19th century. Discovering Asian American literature changed my life and my mind. The book that made me want to be a writerThe monkey in Curious George was a childhood favourite. It must have made me want to be a writer, because the first book I created, in the third grade, was an animal story. Lester the Cat, which I wrote and drew, was about an urban cat stricken with ennui who flees to the countryside, where he falls in love with a country cat. The book or author I came back toIn my early teen years, I read Larry Heinemann’s novel Close Quarters, about the war in Vietnam. Average American soldiers turn into murderers and rapists. The most memorable Vietnamese character is a prostitute named Claymore Face. I was horrified by how Vietnamese people were depicted, and hated the novel for a long time. On rereading it as an adult and a writer, I understood Heinemann was right. His obligation was not to editorialise, sentimentalise or humanise the Vietnamese, when American soldiers dehumanised them. His obligation was to make his readers uncomfortable, because that’s the least they can feel when reading about war. The book I rereadVoltaire’s Candide was, for some reason, in the children’s section of the library. I thought it was a pretty fun fable. As an adult, I realised that the comic travails of Candide were a good model for what I was putting my narrator of The Sympathizer through, so I put in some Candide-like misadventures in its sequel, The Committed. The book I could never read againGeorge Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four. I enjoyed it in high school, but the prose didn’t attract me when I looked at it a few years ago. This was probably because I was obsessed with the next book here … The book I discovered later in lifeAntónio Lobo Antunes’s The Land at the End of the World, inspired by the author’s war experience in Portugal’s colony of Angola. The prose is dense, imagistic, profane and beautiful, the opposite of Orwell’s injunction, in his essay Politics and the English Language, to write clearly. The book I am currently readingGarrett Hongo’s The Perfect Sound: A Memoir in Stereo, about his audiophilic obsession, his life, and his poetic voice. Hongo has been my mentor in buying fancy stereo equipment. He’s cost me a small fortune.  The Committed by Viet Thanh Nguyen is published by Corsair (£8.99).

3/4/2022,"A 13-year-old girl who died after contracting sepsis in an NHS hospital probably would have survived if doctors had identified the warning signs and transferred her to intensive care earlier, a coroner has ruled. Martha Mills, from London, described by her parents as “bright, healthy, enthusiastic”, was the first ever child to die at King’s College hospital (KCH) with a pancreatic injury of the type she sustained in a fall from her bike on an off-road family trail in Wales while on holiday last year. She was transferred to the south London hospital because it is one of three national centres for the care of children with pancreatic trauma. An inquest at St Pancras coroner’s court, north London, heard that several opportunities were missed to refer Martha to intensive care, which probably would have saved her life. In an emotional witness statement read through tears, Martha’s mother, Merope, the editor of the Guardian’s Saturday magazine, said that after their daughter contracted an infection on 21 August last year, she and her husband, Paul Laity, raised concerns about Martha’s deteriorating health a number of times but doctors sought to reassure them rather than escalate her care. She said her daughter’s symptoms initially included a high temperature, diarrhoea and low blood pressure. On 25 August, Martha began to bleed heavily through a tube inserted into the upper arm and through a drainage tube. Mills said in her statement that she explicitly raised her fears about Martha going into septic shock over the bank holiday weekend. On 29 August, Martha had high fever, low blood pressure, a racing heart and a rash, which was misdiagnosed by a junior doctor despite Mills voicing her concern that it was caused by sepsis. It was only the next day that Martha was admitted to paediatric intensive care. “I felt that my anxieties about all of Martha’s symptoms, and especially what they might mean when put together and considered in the round, weren’t given proper acknowledgement,” Mills told the court. Two KCH consultants involved in Martha’s care said at the inquest that she should have been in a high-dependency bed – where critical care reviews are routine – rather than on the Rays of Sunshine ward for children with liver and other conditions, well before she was eventually transferred to intensive care. Prof Anil Dhawan said she should have been placed in a high-dependency bed as early as 6 August, 11 days after the accident, while Prof Richard Thompson said it should have happened on 21 or 22 August. Thompson – who was the duty consultant when the rash appeared, though on call at home – nevertheless explained that on 29 August he had decided that escalation was not necessary. Mills said in her statement that she and Laity were “stunned that no member of the critical care team was even once invited to review Martha on the Rays of Sunshine ward. We know that sepsis is unpredictable and septic shock can come on suddenly, with catastrophic results. So we simply don’t, and never will, understand why a ‘take-no-risks’ approach wasn’t adopted … From the episode of her bleeding, it always seemed evident to us that her situation had become exceptional.” Dr Akash Deep, a professor of paediatric critical care at KCH, was asked by the family’s lawyer, Tamar Burton, whether Martha would have been admitted to intensive care had he seen her. He replied: “100%.” Prof William Bernal, who produced a serious incident report on Martha’s death for KCH, said there were at least five occasions when she should have had a critical care review. He wrote that Martha’s chances of survival “would have been greatly increased” if she had been admitted to critical care earlier. By the time of Martha’s transfer to paediatric intensive care on 30 August she had septic shock and was “profoundly unwell … and failed to respond to interventions”. In Bernal’s report, he also commented on the relationship between the consultants looking after Martha and critical care, stating: “It was reported that referrals were made more often and with a lower trigger threshold, and that relations were easier, with the general rather than liver paediatric services. The perception reported was that the liver ward team sometimes questioned the value of review.” The inquest heard that KCH was making changes in the wake of Martha’s death, including improving diagnostics and taking account of parents’ views. The senior coroner Mary Hassell, whose verdict was based on the balance of probabilities, said Martha had been “incredibly unlucky” to strike the bike’s handlebars in the way she did, but it was an injury many other children had suffered without the same fatal consequences. “She was not transferred to intensive care as she should have been,” Hassell said. “All the evidence I have heard boils down to that. I find the likelihood is if she’d been transferred to intensive care, she would have survived.” Martha’s parents said she was “a fun, singular, very intelligent girl, who had such an appetite for life and all its opportunities. She was growing up to be a strong, remarkable woman … We have now had confirmed what we always knew – that this was a preventable death. Martha’s future has been stolen. We feel outraged on her behalf.” Prof Nicola Ranger, the chief nurse at KCH NHS trust, said: “We would like to extend our deepest sympathies once again to Martha’s family for their loss. We accept the coroner’s findings, and on behalf of the trust, I would like to apologise for the failure to recognise Martha’s deteriorating condition earlier, which led to delays in providing appropriate treatment. We are committed to delivering further improvements to the care we provide to patients at King’s.”",News/Society,"Girl, 13, likely to have survived if moved to intensive care, coroner rules",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/04/girl-13-likely-to-have-survived-if-moved-to-intensive-care-coroner-rules
3/4/2022,"When an Alaskan hunter ventured out into the rugged mountains and dropped his target with a single rifle shot, it seemed like the perfect crime. The only witness lay dead on the rocky landscape. But Donald Lee’s deception was uncovered after forensic work by a savvy online sleuth and conservation officers revealed that Lee killed a bighorn sheep in Canada – not the United States, as he had previously claimed. A Yukon court slapped Lee with a C$8,500 (US$6,700) fine and barred him from hunting in Canada for five years after he pleaded guilty to an offence under federal wildlife protection laws. “I am regretful for the decisions I made that day,” Lee said in court, CBC reported. “I can’t return the animal to the mountain.” In 2017, Lee was hunting the Nation River area of Alaska, close to the Yukon border. He spotted a Fannin sheep grazing on the mountainside, less than 200 metres away. What he didn’t realise, he later told the court, was that the animal was across the border in Canada – where he didn’t have a permit to hunt. It was only after he had bagged the sheep that the penny dropped, he alleged. “I suppose I could have contacted someone to get in touch with the Canadian authorities somehow. Instead I made some poor decisions,” Lee wrote in a statement read to the court. Those decisions included filling out paperwork to say the kill was in Alaska. He ate the meat from his kill and brought the carcass to a taxidermist, mounting the curly-horned ungulate on his wall. But it was his choice to post trophy photos of the kill that was his undoing. Images posted to a sheep hunting forum included both date and geolocation. A sharp-eyed user then sent a tip to Yukon conservation officers, who then travelled by helicopter to the remote area where Lee was believed to have shot the sheep. The Yukon team painstakingly recreated the scene, using landmarks including distinct rocks and scraggly trees to prove Lee had committed a crime. Lee now has one year to pay the fine and was previously ordered to turn over the stuffed head. “I will also say that the sentence imposed today is one which should send a strong message to the public about the price,” said Noel Sinclair, the crown attorney, told reporters after Lee was sentenced. “Unethical hunters will pay when they are careless or deliberately turning a blind eye to the regulatory requirements for hunting in the Yukon.”",News/World news,US hunter fined after trophy photo proves he shot sheep in Canada,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/canada-us-hunter-sheep-fine-photo
3/4/2022,"Hello and good morning. Russia has resorted to “nuclear terror”, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said, after Russian bombing resulted in fires at Europe’s largest nuclear plant. The fires burned for hours at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant overnight after shelling from Russian forces prompted widespread concern about the safety of Ukraine’s atomic infrastructure. The reactors are safe and the blaze was extinguished at 6.20am local time. But the incident underlined the dangers to a nuclear plant in the midst of the conflict. The Russian military now controls the site. “Europe must wake up now,” Zelenskiy said. “No country other than Russia has ever fired on nuclear power units … This is the first time in our history. In the history of mankind. The terrorist state now resorted to nuclear terror.” What’s the situation with radiation? The International Atomic Energy Agency said, shortly before 4am Ukraine time, that it had been informed by the Ukrainian nuclear regulator there was no change in radiation levels at the plant. How did world leaders react? President Joe Biden called Zelenskiy at 3.40am Kyiv time, urging Russia “cease its military activities in the area and allow firefighters and emergency responders to access the site”. The UK prime minister Boris Johnson called it “reckless” and echoed ceasefire calls. What is Putin thinking? The “worst is yet to come”, France said yesterday, after Russia’s Vladimir Putin and France’s Emmanuel Macron spoke for 90 minites – as Putin said Kyiv’s “refusal to accept Russia’s conditions” means he will continue to pursue his war in Ukraine. What about talks? Ukraine and Russia yesterday agreed to temporary, local ceasefires to allow the evacuation of civilians as well as aid deliveries via safe corridors. Zelenskiy asked Putin for face-to-face talks. Eight days after Vladimir Putin’s invasion it is clear that a significant number of his servicemen are demoralised and reluctant to fight, Luke Harding reports from Lviv. Some have given themselves up. Others have abandoned their vehicles and set off back towards the Russian border on foot, lugging their weapons and kitbags, videos suggest. These episodes do not mean that the Kremlin will fail in its attempts to conquer Ukraine, as its tactics shift to the brutal shelling of civilian targets. Low morale among invading troops might be one reason why Russia’s blitzkrieg plan to overwhelm Ukraine appears not to have progressed at the speed Putin would have wanted. “Frankly speaking, they tricked us,” a Russian officer says in one video, referring to his military superiors sitting in Moscow. “Everything we were told was a fake.” Meanwhile, Ukraine has announced it will issue non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to fund its armed forces, as cryptocurrency becomes an increasingly popular means of giving support to the government in Kyiv. What’s happening in Chernihiv? Russian forces killed at least 33 civilians in a single airstrike in a residential area yesterday, Ukrainian forces said. The city has been bombarded, alongside Kharkiv. What’s happening in Kyiv? Ukraine retains control. A US defence official suggested the Russian advance appears to have “stalled”, but there are also reports that about 15,000 troops attached to a huge column of Russian military vehicles nearby may be regrouping, waiting to attack. What’s happening in southern Ukraine? Russian forces appeared to be moving to cut off Ukraine from the sea via its key southern ports, claiming the capture of Kherson and tightening the siege of Mariupol. Donald Trump has reached an agreement with the New York attorney general’s office that will temporarily spare him from having to answer questions under oath as part of an investigation into his business.

Trump will not have to appear while he’s appealing the ruling.

3/4/2022,"Russian elites could have their property seized and handed over to Ukrainian refugees, the deputy prime minister has suggested. Dominic Raab made the remarks as he defended the UK’s response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine and the prime minister, Boris Johnson, called for an emergency UN summit after a Russian attack on a nuclear power station in Ukraine. Asked on LBC radio whether Britain could capture property assets owned by Russian oligarchs in punishment for Moscow’s invasion on Ukraine, Raab said: “If we’ve got the evidence and the legal basis, then we’ll do it.” Pressed on whether he would back using those properties to house Ukrainian refugee – a move called for by the Liberal Democrats and reportedly argued for in government by the housing secretary, Michael Gove – Raab replied: “Yes, absolutely. “We are looking at everything in the round, it is a team effort across government, from the foreign and defence secretary through to Michael Gove and, of course, the prime minister is driving this very hard.” The UK government has faced criticism for being too slow in its approach to implementing sanctions against Russian figures and linked assets. The Labour party chairwoman, Anneliese Dodds, said the UK had got to “stop dragging” its feet in clamping down on funds that have come from figures linked to Putin. She told Sky News: “I certainly would say that we have been far too soft, especially over the last 10 years, on those funds that have come from Putin-linked oligarchs and business people.” She added: “We see, even with the new measures that finally have been extracted from the government now that they say they will announce on Monday, an 18-month window before they will come into action – that’s just not good enough. “We need immediate action now. We can put those registers of foreign-owned property into place in 28 days, we believe we could get those running and force that transparency.” Raab insisted the the UK was “at the vanguard” of imposing sanctions on Kremlin-linked money. Asked during broadcast interviews why the European Union had sanctioned more individual Russian elites than Britain, he said on BBC Breakfast it was a “false distinction”, adding: “The question is not whether it is individuals or companies – it is where the money is flowing.” Support local charities There are several Ukrainian charities working on the ground. Sunflower of Peace is a charity that helps paramedics and doctors, and has been fundraising for supplies, which includes first aid medical tactical backpacks. United Help Ukraine focuses on providing medical supplies and humanitarian aid, and raising awareness of the conflict. Voices of Children aims to help children affected by the war in eastern Ukraine, providing support through art therapy, psychologists, video storytelling and a number of other methods. The British Red Cross has launched an emergency appeal to help Ukraine. The charity will be updating its webpage with news on the work its team is doing, and how support will be used to help people. Support local journalism English-language news outlets based in the country, such as Kyiv Independent and the New Voice of Ukraine, are covering developments on the ground as the conflict unfolds, using local journalists. The Kyiv Independent says it was created by journalists in order to defend editorial independence. This site on Twitter covers many local journalists in Ukraine.

Separately, he said: “There has been a running commentary that the UK has somehow been slow – we’ve not been slow.

3/4/2022,"The UK “is very much not adapted to climate change and not prepared”, according to a lead author of a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The study, published this week and approved by 195 countries, says the worldwide impacts of the climate crisis are more severe than predicted and there is only a narrow chance of securing “a liveable future for all”. In the UK, more flooding from rivers, at the coasts, and from intense downpours in urban areas is one of the biggest impacts, the report says. Sewage works, airports and seaports are among the key infrastructure at risk, along with the impacts of storms on the electricity and communication networks. While winters are getting wetter, summers are becoming drier, and water shortages are on track to increase in England and Wales, the report says, doubling in frequency within decades. Heatwaves are also a rising and deadly threat, with many homes and hospitals unprepared. One in three heat-related deaths in the UK between 1991 and 2018 were caused by global heating, according to a study cited in the report. Global climate impacts will also cause shortages of imported goods and increase their price in the UK, the report says, as well as damaging markets for British exports. The report even warns of financial instability due to economic shocks caused by climate change. “The IPCC report backs up the conclusions of the UK climate change risk assessment (CCRA) published in 2021,” said Prof Richard Betts, at the UK Met Office and a lead author of both the IPCC report and the CCRA. “The key point is that the UK is very much not adapted to climate change and not prepared.” Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser to the UK government, responded to the IPCC report by warning of increasing extreme weather in the UK: “This will strain housing, agriculture, transport and supply chains – little of which was built with such pressure in mind.” He also warned of more wildfires endangering cities near moorland, such as in Manchester and Sheffield. “The challenge is enormous but it can be met,” Vallance said. The IPCC report, which is based on 34,000 scientific studies,says over the past three decades the UK and Europe have experienced the highest number of river floods in the past 500 years. It says some coastal communities in the UK may have to move inland and that the number of people at risk of annual coastal flooding in the UK would rise from 3.2 million to more than 5 million in a worst-case scenario. “As an island nation, what happens on the coast is a particular issue,” said Mike Morecroft, at Natural England and one of the 234 lead authors of the IPCC report. But he said restoring nature on the coasts could provide better protection than hard defences, such as at the Steart salt marshes in Somerset. Peter Alexander, at the University of Edinburgh and another IPCC author, said climate impacts on farming in the UK and around the world affected people. “We are part of a global food system. We import close to half the food that we consume and, if the rest of the world’s agriculture is being impacted by climate change, then we’re going to effectively import those impacts to the UK, largely through potentially higher food prices,” he said. The Climate Change Committee (CCC), the UK government’s official advisers, said in June 2021 the government was failing to protect people from the fast-rising risks of the climate crisis, with action to improve resilience not keeping pace with the impacts of global heating. The CCC’s experts said they were frustrated by the “absolutely illogical” lack of sufficient action on adaptation, given that acting is up to 10 times more cost-effective than not doing so. “We must go much further and faster to truly prepare for the impacts of a warmer world,” the government acknowledged in its legally required assessment of climate risks, published in January. “In the majority of risk areas we need to take more action.” The IPCC report was “stark”, a UK government spokesperson said: “We are working at pace on our national adaptation programme [due in 2023], with robust measures, including £5.2bn to tackle flooding and coastal erosion in the UK.” The IPCC report strongly emphasises that the climate crisis hits the poor, vulnerable and excluded in society the most, and that addressing inequality is an essential part of tackling global heating. “Different segments of the population can be more or less vulnerable, and that applies not just in developing countries but within the UK as well,” said Prof Lindsay Stringer, at the University of York and an IPCC author. The chair of the CCC’s adaptation committee, Julia King, writing with the former chair, John Krebs, said: “Adaptation should be integral to ‘levelling up’ [in the UK]. Poorer households are more severely affected by the health and financial consequences of flooding and other extremes.” “The UK has the capacity and the resources to adapt but the government is simply not doing enough,” they said. “Lack of action now is storing up problems and costs for future generations: they will have to pay for our negligence.”",News/Environment,"UK not prepared for climate impacts, warns IPCC expert",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/04/uk-not-prepared-climate-impacts-ipcc-intergovernmental
3/4/2022,"The London Stock Exchange suspended trading in more Russian companies on Friday, while an independent director resigned from the board of Evraz, the steel and mining group in which Roman Abramovich holds a 29% stake. The LSE suspended trading in the remaining eight companies with strong links to Russia that were not included on a list of 27 companies suspended on Thursday. The companies trade financial instruments in London, including global depositary receipts and American depositary receipts, but not ordinary shares, which are traded in on other stock exchanges where they have their primary listings. Also on Friday, Evraz – which has its primarily listing in London and is incorporated in the UK – announced that James Rutherford had resigned from the board immediately. Rutherford was a non-executive director at Evraz for only nine months and also holds directorships at the mining groups Centamin and Anglo Pacific. His resignation comes a day after the Institute of Directors urged British nationals to quit Russian boards, saying it was “no longer tenable” for them to remain after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, adding that any directors of Belarusian firms should also quit. Evraz also counts the former Ford executive Stephen Odell and Sir Michael Peat, a former private secretary to Prince Charles and whose family name is the p in KPMG, on its board. Peat, who was paid $224,000 (£168,232) last year, is due to stand down at the end of March, having been a board member since 2011. Rutherford was paid $125,000 from his appointment last June until the end of last year. Odell was paid $138,000. Evraz, which last week announced a dividend worth $450m to Abramovich, has so far not been caught in the sanctions being levelled at companies with strong links to Russia. On Thursday, the London Stock Exchange suspended trading in 27 companies, including the energy and banking firms Gazprom and Sberbank. The LSE said it was taking the action “in light of market conditions, and in order to maintain orderly markets”. On Friday, the LSE added the state-owned Federal Grid, Russia’s largest transmission company, the telecoms provider Rostelecom, the residential property developer Etalon, the supermarket chain O’Key, the fertiliser company Acron, the food retail chain Magnit, the investment firm Sistema and the commercial seaport Novorossiysk to its list of companies barred from trading in London. However, Evraz is one of a number of companies linked to Russia that have so far not been barred because they have been assigned “UK nationality” by the LSE for trading purposes. Nevertheless, international pressure is taking an increasing toll on Russian businesses, while the invasion of Ukraine is also disrupting those with operations in the region. On Wednesday, Evraz and the precious metals mining group Polymetal dropped out of the FTSE 100 in its quarterly review after their market values plummeted.

3/4/2022,"Many universities across the US have cut men’s sports in recent years, including track and field teams. It’s a painful reality for many athletes. But the problem is not just that these athletes lose opportunities to compete. Their supporters say that cutting these sports such as track disproportionately harms Black men and closes doors to educational opportunities. It also has some broader consequences. In the last couple of years, five universities announced they would cut their men’s track and field (and sometimes men’s cross-country) teams: Brown, Clemson, Central Michigan, the College of William & Mary and the University of Minnesota. They have cited various reasons for doing so, including Covid-19-related budget cuts, Title IX compliance, and redirecting resources to make their athletic programs more competitive overall. Most of these teams have since been reinstated. A fight is still under way to reinstate Central Michigan University’s men’s track and field team, which the university announced it was cutting in May 2020, due to Covid-related budget cuts. While it demoted track from varsity to club, it elevated golf. In the NCAA, football and basketball include a substantial number of Black athletes. Beyond those two sports, track and field teams provide the next highest number of Black men – far more than any other sport. The NCAA data from 2021 on Division I shows that football teams included more than 13,000 Black men, and basketball included more than 3,000. Indoor track had 2,669 Black men, outdoor track had 2,978, and cross-country had 425. The next highest numbers: 665 in baseball and 632 in soccer. Golf teams included 55 Black men. “College sports enable direct pathways to admission via their recruitment slots,” says Russell Dinkins, executive director of the Tracksmith Foundation and a former Princeton track athlete who has been pushing to get these men’s teams reinstated. “The only sport besides football and basketball that provides these kinds of direct pathways in a way that serves a broader population, and that disproportionately benefits Black and brown and low-income kids, is track and field.” A school that cuts track and adds a mostly white, affluent sport like golf effectively reserves nearly all of its recruitment slots in non-revenue sports for white, affluent students, Dinkins says. “This is about educational access through sport.” At CMU, a reinstatement committee has been trying to get the university to bring track back. Dinkins filed a civil complaint against CMU asking the school to reinstate the program, and the ACLU of Michigan has expressed its support. Mark Fancher, staff attorney with the ACLU of Michigan’s Racial Justice Project, said in a letter to CMU President Robert Davies that the team has “served as a springboard to upward mobility for substantial numbers of Black CMU students”. Eliminating a sport that benefits Black students and “replacing it with it a program that is regarded as a white sport – and, in fact, is a white sport because of historical and social reasons – that sends a hostile message,” Fancher told the Guardian. “CMU is a public institution that’s supposed to be serving our interests and is funded with our tax dollars,” Fancher says. “We’re concerned about the message that [cutting the team] sends to students of color, regardless of whether they aspire to be in a track program.” When the athletes found out the team was dropped, they were “pissed, confused, and heartbroken”. says Bryant Wilson, who was associate head coach of track and field at the time. “It really put them in a tough position, because some of them are juniors and seniors, and financially it doesn’t make sense for them to transfer.” CMU honored the scholarships of athletes who had them, but if they left, not all credits would transfer, and not all the students would be able to afford tuition elsewhere, Wilson explains. A few did leave. In track and cross-country, unlike many other sports, men’s and women’s teams often train together and share coaches and facilities. CMU didn’t expect the blowback it got from the women’s team, Wilson says. “They didn’t realize how close-knit the men’s and women’s program is, and how many women left the program because their training partners and teammates were taken away.” On campuses that are largely white, cutting the men’s track team also denies the women athletes peers of color, Dinkins adds. Dinkins has helped Brown, Clemson, William & Mary and Minnesota in their reinstatement efforts as well. Brown announced in May 2020 that it was cutting its men’s track and field and cross-country teams and elevating its sailing program instead. Brown students, alumni and supporters mobilized and put pressure on the university. Brynn Smith, a former thrower at Brown, got involved immediately because she benefited from the opportunities the team opened up for her. “I am a first-generation college student. I come from a low-middle, working-class family in Maine and never really saw myself leaving my hometown, to be frank,” she says. But then, “my world begins to change … and I get this amazing education at a school that I never would have dreamt of going to.” When she got there, she learned that many of her teammates had similar experiences. “Of course, not everybody comes from some type of marginalized background, but a lot of us on the team really identified with this concept of upward mobility” that it provided, Smith says. Dinkins got involved when he published an article on Medium calling the university out for saying it wanted to confront racial justice while also cutting one of its few diverse sports. The article went viral. “At the time, Brown’s track team had more Black athletes on it than four of their other men’s programs combined, and there were no Black people on their sailing program at all,” he says. Days later, Brown reversed its decision. The university president acknowledged: “[W]e now more fully appreciate the consequences of eliminating men’s track and field and cross country for black students in our community and among our extended community of black alumni.” Replacing track and field with sailing would “create more slots at the school that are going to go to students who already have a disproportionate amount of opportunity in getting into schools like Brown University”, says Jordan Mann, who served as a volunteer assistant coach for Brown’s cross-country team. The university chooses which students to offer opportunities to, Mann says. “It’s sad when [opportunities are] taken away from the students who do track, who are racially diverse and socioeconomically diverse, and given to students from other sports who are not.” In fall 2020, William & Mary announced it was cutting men’s indoor and outdoor track and field, and then it reinstated them. Clemson said it would cut indoor and outdoor track and field, as well as cross-country, and then reversed course. Minnesota cut indoor and outdoor track and field, but it ended up keeping outdoor. “When the University of Minnesota announced that they were cutting their men’s track program, I said, OK, this is about to be a trend. We have to get moving on this,” Dinkins says. He and some of the Brown organizers collaborated to share what they had done and created a toolkit for William & Mary, Clemson, and Minnesota. Universities that cut men’s track teams with little or no regard for the harm it inflicts on Black students also violate their own stated diversity, equity, and inclusion principles, advocates say. “In the wake of George Floyd, a lot of schools made outward commitments and proclamations of being more cognizant of racial bias,” including the experiences of Black people in particular, Dinkins says. But for the schools that have cut track programs, their actions don’t line up with their values, he says. “What is going to have the most meaningful impact: Creating a statement, having people do a workshop? … Or making sure that there are opportunities that serve populations that are historically and currently under-resourced, and ensuring that those populations are given the tools and support in order to thrive at institutions and beyond?” Dinkins asks. For universities to act in line with their statements, they would need to “ensure that institutional decision-making engages in a deeper level analysis that looks at the impact in addition to whatever the surface-level concerns are”, Dinkins says. “From my purview, universities have not taken that step.” A June 2020 CMU Board of Trustees resolution says: “[W]e believe diversity, inclusion and equity enhance the educational experience; strengthen communities; foster the exchange of ideas and innovation; promote civic engagement; and prepare students for leadership in a complex global society.” Wilson says, “Actions speak louder than words. I think there’s a lot of lip service that’s associated with higher education.” Mann agrees. “So long as an institution is officially, publicly, vocally and repeatedly saying that its values are about racial justice and racial equity, it’s really not conscionable for it to fall this far behind in action,” he says. Joyce Baugh was a professor at CMU from 1988 to 2017, and she assisted the reinstatement committee. “Having these young Black men on the track and field team, as part of the campus, they added to the diversity in the classroom,” she says. Baugh points to the importance of “the contributions of these young athletes to the university, not just athletically, but academically, socially, culturally – all of those things, and then the contribution to their education, to their well-being, to their ability to go to get a good education, to become successful people in whatever they decide to do, and for them to be able to go back and contribute to their communities.” According to the National Center for Education Statistics, 11% of CMU’s undergraduates in fall 2020 were Black. That’s lower than Michigan’s overall Black population, which was 14% in 2021. “By CMU not being truly reflective of the diversity that exists within the state of Michigan, those who go to CMU are not getting the fullest experience that they can get in terms of an immersive educational experience,” Dinkins says. Smith echoes that concern. She says she is white, but she felt at home on Brown’s track and field team because of the diversity it included – in terms of race, socioeconomic background, languages spoken, support for the LGBTQIA community, and other factors – more than she did elsewhere on campus. Track is unique in its low cost, making it more accessible to lower-income kids than other sports. A 2019 Aspen Institute survey looked at the cost of sports for kids up to age 18, and track and field was the cheapest of all the sports: $191 was the average annual cost. The average annual cost of all sports was $693. Golf was $925. Smith says she and her Brown colleagues were also concerned that, if more schools cut track, the sport itself may be in jeopardy at the college level. “If these big leagues begin to cancel their teams, what they’re effectively doing is eliminating league competition. If even one more Ivy League cut a track team while we were doing this, then the argument begins: Do we all just eliminate track because now there’s only five Ivy League schools?” she says. Dinkins says universities making these decisions should look “not only at the numbers but also the human, societal and community-wide impact. The educational opportunities that track and field offers to some of these students can be life-altering,” especially when they may not otherwise be able to go to college, he says. “It can also be life-altering for their communities.” The men on these teams are the ones who lose their spots. But the harmful effect of subtracting Black men from this equation spreads to their female athlete counterparts and their fellow students, regardless of race, as well as to the broader university community and beyond.",Sport/Sport,"As NCAA track and field programs vie to survive, Black students suffer most",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/04/as-ncaa-track-and-field-programs-vie-to-survive-black-students-suffer-most
3/4/2022,"Hey, Debbie, in Face It [Harry’s memoir], you discussed the creation of the Blondie persona. How intentional were your choices in character curation, and why did you choose to adopt a persona in the first place? ChloSchmo I think we’re all seeing images or performances that we like and absorbing and amalgamating them. As a kid, the beautiful women on the silver screen were fairytale versions of what life is for a woman, because when I was coming up there was no such thing as women’s lib. A persona gave me freedom, a world of my own. You pick a character that you love and then it becomes you. As an adopted person, I have always had a heightened sense of curiosity and feeling different. Can you relate to that? DavidMcr Totally. It’s animal instincts. I can’t define it more than that, but I know that exists for me. I never met my birth parents. Their family did not want to extend themselves, and as an adult I had to respect that. If I had found that out when I was a child, it would have been crushing. I had a Blondie poster in my teenage bedroom. Which poster did you have in yours? enriquec Because I’m so ancient [laughs], I don’t think posters came in until much later. My parents were into big bands, so I started listening to pop music on the radio and paying attention to DJs, because I was too young to go to concerts – and my parents were definitely not going to go because they did not appreciate it! Which song are you most proud of? itsbleached Oh God … obviously Heart of Glass or Rapture. Also a more recent song, Mother [from 2010] – the lyrics fell into place beautifully and said exactly what I wanted to say, about children of the night who go to clubs and have this dark alternative universe away from their daily life. Which projects that got away – such as the offer to sing the James Bond theme For Your Eyes Only or the chance to appear in Blade Runner – haunt you most? McScootikins They don’t haunt me. The James Bond thing was a misunderstanding about what they wanted – but so many things have gone right that I don’t dwell on inconsistencies or regrets or think: “God, that ruined my life!” What inspired you to write Picture This? I’ve always loved the part where you sing “get a pocket computer” before we knew that cell phones were coming … eduardalennertz In a way it was a tribute to Andy Warhol, who took a lot of Polaroid photos. The lyric quickly wrote itself. I had a visual image of the Polaroid coming out of the camera. I can’t possibly comment on the line about “watching you shower”. I read Face It recently and was struck by how many times you’ve cheated death or disaster [including heroin addiction, abduction by someone Harry believes was Ted Bundy, and sexual assault]. Has your guardian angel had to work overtime? RobinBustid Probably! I don’t think in those terms but I can’t say it was a great idea to be as curious and reckless as I was. Like daredevil athletes or people that jump out of planes, we’re all testing our boundaries, and mine were very large [laughs]. I barely took notice of any lucky escapes. I really went after discovery. Is it true that you saw the last Velvet Underground show at Max’s Kansas City [ the New York venue where Harry was a waitress]? nigelbarton I wasn’t there for that last night. I hope I saw them there but I can’t honestly say I did. It’s a blur. There was so much going on, and a lot of great artists hung out at Max’s. I distinctly remember meeting Stevie Winwood, and how adorable he was. Not to say that he’s not adorable now. I did get to see the Velvets when they reunited and played only two shows, and that was wonderful. Debbie, you were ahead of your time when you became famous and yet you appear to have been a supremely confident woman in what was arguably a man’s world. Where did that confidence come from? DeborahGeller I must have been somewhat confident. Our goal was to be as exciting and cantankerous as possible. But I always considered myself in a partnership with Chris [Stein] and that I was trying to express the whole band’s point of view. So in some ways a lot of things that I was saying would be, in today’s world, transgender. Maybe that’s why it works. This isn’t a question, but in 1978 or 1979 I was a very closeted trans kid watching Blondie on Top of the Pops with my friends. The inevitable question arose about who would like a date with you. I drew a deep breath and said: “I want to be Debbie.” There was a stony silence as I outed myself. I finally came out as trans three years ago so I owe you a lot … rachaeltyrell I’m very flattered. I can imagine how heart-rending and difficult it is to make that stand. The people who do this are very brave and I have tremendous feeling for them and for all of us, because otherwise it’s a denial of the human race. Do you remember the first time somebody recognised you? itsbleached Probably in the 70s when the CBGB scene was beginning and after Chris had submitted photos to Soho News, a little downtown paper. For a long time I had more publicity in photos than anything else, which was odd but worked in our favour. People still assume that I am “Blondie”, but after all these years bleaching my hair, I should at least be called Blondie! How did you find acting in Videodrome with James Woods? And was [writer/director] David Cronenberg as mad in real life as his movies? teabags12 James was constantly making funny remarks, which was a great relief. He was always making suggestions about scenes and was very helpful to me. David just seemed like a dedicated film-maker who found his niche, where his imagination took fire. A History of Violence and Eastern Promises are wonderful pictures. He also takes little cameo roles and he’s actually a really great actor. Would Madonna have succeeded without your pathfinding? JOHNNYHEMISPHERE I wouldn’t want to venture a guess, but I think that she’s tremendously motivated and smart, and I have no doubt that she would have had a great career without me. Some of Blondie’s most celebrated recordings are cover versions, such as The Tide Is High or Hanging on the Telephone. My favourite [cover of a Blondie song] is Ride’s interpretation of Union City Blue with vocals by Alex Taylor from the Motorcycle Boy. Is there a Blondie cover that you are particularly fond of? VerulamiamParkRanger I like Green Day’s Dreaming, and another that was sent to me by an unknown group on a cassette, which was particularly haunting and really took it in a different direction. More recently, I liked what Miley Cyrus did with Heart of Glass. She’s made it a bit herself, which is the art of a great cover. When we did Johnny Cash’s Ring of Fire in a film called Roadie, nobody had done it as a rock song before, and we played it like we were on a fast trip to hell. I’m still really excited and happy about doing that.  Blondie’s Against the Odds tour with special guest Johnny Marr comes to the UK from 22 April to 7 May.

3/4/2022,"What a fantastic cackle Jane Campion has. The only woman twice nominated for a best director Oscar could come off a bit austere: colossal CV, monochrome uniform, touch of Michael Haneke to the knitwear. But that laugh! It first barks out in the introductions then sticks around the whole time, so infectious you start guffawing at things that aren’t funny. It’s warm and straightforward, and so is she. When I come into the room, Campion is hugging Ari Wegner on the couch. Wegner, 38, was the director of photography (DOP) on The Power of the Dog; she wears a padded kimono, blue grandad shirt and bright red trousers. Campion is recounting how she went to Tate Britain and ate this and that and isn’t it great New Zealand has reopened its borders! “It’s fabulous! Til the next lurgy-burgy or whatever!” Omicron is no match for Kiwi bonhomie. Wegner seems almost as lovestruck as I am, and she has spent nearly two years with Campion, first preparing The Power of the Dog, then shooting it in New Zealand, including a four-month break at the start of the pandemic. They are in town on an awards push. Does The Power of the Dog need it? Not really. It has 12 Oscar nominations, the most of any film this year, and few would bet against it winning picture, director, cinematography, score, adapted screenplay, editing and more besides. Also nominated is Benedict Cumberbatch, who stars as Phil Burbank, a bullying rancher in 1925 Montana; and for best supporting actor, Jesse Plemons, as his mild brother, George, and also Kirsten Dunst as George’s new wife, Rose, who buckles beneath Phil’s hostility. But perhaps a surer bet for a win is Kodi Smit-McPhee as Peter, Rose’s delicate son, whom Phil first persecutes then begins to regale with tales of his dead mentor, Bronco Henry, whose prize saddle he buffs nightly. If Campion wins the Oscar, she’ll be only the third woman to do so, following Kathryn Bigelow in 2010 and Chloé Zhao last year. Wegner is only the second female cinematographer to ever be nominated. I begin by asking how comfortable they feel with all the glass-ceiling chat. Jane Campion: I don’t think about it. People love to talk about records. Personally, I don’t. But I’m really proud of Ari, because she’s only 12 years old. Ari Wegner: Almost 13. JC: She’s the first woman to finally crack that ceiling and it needs to go. There’s nothing that a woman DOP can’t do. AW: Art should be genderless. [All that matters is] if you have a skill and a passion for something. JC: What’s exciting is that it’s no longer charitable to support a woman film-maker – it’s a wise business choice. We don’t wanna be like: “Why don’t we have an award for the best woman film-maker?” I’m sorry. I am not gonna go for that. That’s disgusting. It’s ridiculous. I think the change is about the #MeToo movement and busting up of sexual abuse and the calling out and realisation of the enormous inequities. Women have been emboldened by that. Catherine Shoard: Do you think the tastes of the Academy have evolved because of their diversity push? With the big wins for Nomadland and Parasite in the past two years? JC: I don’t know. Go back one year further and it’s Green Book! It’s always a mystery. We can’t see into the minds of the Academy. They vote with their hearts. We hope they vote for us! But it’s all a plus for film. [The Oscars] bring people into cinemas – or on to the Academy online screening room at least. And it’s been such a buzz to have made something that people go deeply into. Not everybody, obviously, but a great many more than I would’ve ever expected. CS: Why? JC: Well, I thought it was a good story and I know some people only really responded to it in that way, but the rest is really rich and I would’ve thought maybe off-putting for more straight punters. But when I arrived in London, the guy at the passport desk said: “Love Power of the Dog by the way. Absolutely wonderful film.” Normally they say: “You’re a film-maker? Anything I’d have seen?” I doubt it! CS: So what do you see of yourselves in each other? AW: We both definitely love homework. JC: The sense of satisfaction you’ve really explored something. Shooting is an amazing opportunity and it feels very hollow if you haven’t bothered to figure it out. Ari is super-interested in the power of preparation. It’s like being marinated in different ideas and possibilities. When we got to shoot, I got so scared because I was like: “I don’t know what to do!” And then you realise: “Oh, it’s kicking in. I can feel it!” It’s like you trained your intuition. CS: Is that more common among women? Do men wing it more? JC: Broadly, I would sort of agree with you, but if I’m trying to think of the examples, I’m not sure. [Guillermo] Del Toro does a really obsessive amount of prep. But it’s really about artists with vision and artists with swagger. But I have seen a lot of people go: “Hey, I’m directing a movie! I know the DOP will help me fix it and look good. I’ve got a good budget and good actors and it’s gonna come together.” They don’t really know what their job is or how you create a vision. CS: How critical for the crew is it that the director and DOP are in sync? JC: I don’t like to think about what the crew is doing. I didn’t know hardly any of them, except for Ari and the heads of department and my first assistant, who’s so essential to my confidence and making the film happen. With the crew, I’m really always trying not to care what they think. I’m not there to please them. But I did get the impression that as time went on, they got more committed. Some of the young women actually said it was exciting to see us work together and how much everything meant and how the decisions were so well thought out. It made them want to shift their game up. CS: It sounds quite different from the kind of lawlessness we’ve heard about recently on the sets of, say, Mad Max: Fury Road and Rust. JC: I think [that kind of set] probably does exist. I’ve never had one myself. The stories behind Rust are just so tragic. There is a lot of pressure at times, and that’s a really bad thing when you’ve got lethal weapons. I don’t even see why they need bullets of any kind on set. AW: I’ve never been on a kind of wild west type of set. I find [most sets are] actually quite a well-oiled machine, because there’s too much at stake. JC: I like a really soft set because it’s actor-friendly. We are here to capture their performance and without them feeling safe and listened to and looked after, we’re not gonna get it. I remember saying to [production designer] Grant Major, when we were doing the costume and makeup checks: “I don’t wanna see that clapperboard!” It’s put in front of an actor and goes: “CLAP!” Horrible! He said: “Oh, I get where we’re going. This is gonna be very different …” CS: Were there other measures you took? JC: No phones on set. They’re just so incredibly distracting. Energy drains. When we were doing Top of the Lake we didn’t have a rule like that and you’d look around and everybody was slouched on couches just absorbed in their world and their phones. [On The Power of the Dog] if you moved yourself out of the way of the sightline of everybody who’s working hard that moment, or you went to your car, you could check your phone. But you’re paid to be working. AW: I think people actually enjoyed not having them, though there is a lot of downtime on sets. JC: People used to use a lot of drugs to get through the very long hours. But it’s not really me; I’ve always felt I was so lucky to be doing this that you’ve gotta put everything you’ve got into it. Though it could be kind of fun to do it really stoned … AW: I can’t think of anything worse! JC: It could be kind of cool. The funny thing is you have to care and not care because caring can become too pressuring on the day. AW: As much as you can prepare and there’s a safety net with the storyboards, there’s so much you can’t know until all the elements are in front of you. And you want to be open to the possibility that a new, better idea is gonna come to you. JC: There are films that are pre-visualised and have already created every facet of their world. So there is no dance with chance. And I think that’s sort of sad. We had a dance with the weather, and we thought that was the big dance. Then the pandemic came along. CS: Beyond the logistics, did that change your approach to the story? JC: Yeah. It was an amazing opportunity for reflection, apart from feeling a bit bummed because it felt possible Netflix would say: “Oh, don’t bother finishing it.” Nobody knew where we were heading. But once we got the idea that things in New Zealand were getting very stable very quickly and Netflix said to keep going, then we had a look at what the editor put together. It’s a desperate thing to look at. Painful because it looks shitty. But you’re learning a lot about what we were enjoying and what we needed more of and less of. I always think of the Muhammad Ali quote: “Dance like a butterfly, sting like a bee.” And what I finally realised was that the dance was Ari and my dancing with circumstances and then the sting was when we stood as close to Phil as we could. CS: In the film, Phil says that man is made by patience and the odds against him. Do you agree? JC: I never really think like that. It feels like a 1920s, Reader’s Digest kind of way of thinking. It’s Phil’s language, not mine. But I love it in terms of their characters. Phil at this moment is just trying to rub Peter’s nose in the fact that his mother’s an alcoholic, but at the same time they’re becoming friends. CS: You’ve said you thought Thomas Savage [who wrote the 1967 novel on which the film is based] would be OK with your directing the film as he was quite a feminine man. Could you talk any more about making a western – one concerned with definitions of masculinity – as a woman? JC: I got a lot of comfort realising it’s a very subversive piece of work written by a gay man who was secreted on a ranch. Savage knows Phil because he actually could break horses, but he also was a tennis-shoe-wearing effete. He really did go to a ranch with his mother and lived with a guy very similar to Phil as his uncle. So you get the feeling that he’s writing about what he knows in a pretty spectacular way and also peeling that onion of masculinity. Taking layer and layer off until you find what’s underneath, which is vulnerability. Overt masculinity is sometimes performative. And that necessity to perform as a male – I don’t like it. It’s pretty tough. AW: I think there’s a lot that’s universal and timeless in Phil’s vulnerability and also in what happens to people that you’ve known who aren’t here any more. CS: I was struck watching it again by how much Bronco Henry lives on after death. JC: I used to be obsessed with imagining what happened between Bronco Henry and Phil. I had my own fantasies about it and I think Ben[edict Cumberbatch] had his too, which are quite different. I saw a picture of the man people thought might have been the model for Bronco Henry and he looked like Clark Gable. Super confident, dash, big woolies. CS: He must have been considerably older than Phil. JC: Yeah, I think Phil is gonna be Peter’s Bronco Henry. He charged Peter up with a lot of agency. CS: The shot of him putting the rope Phil made for him under the bed … JC: It’s quite eroticised. That rope, man! That’s such an object. You’re making a rope out of the hides of the beasts that you grow on the ranch. It’s sort of like a proof of masculinity because you use it to get animals into submission. AW: And it’s made from their own skin! CS: It’s so fetishistic. Did you ever worry about overdoing all the leather and ropes and chaps? JC: I encouraged it! I loved it because they looked like satyrs. And when I looked at the pictures from the period, big woolies are really common; I guess Montana’s super-cold. So wearing a sheep on each leg is sort of helpful. You see Peter starting to wear these wrist leather things, God knows what for. People love gear. Now they love running shoes. Gear, stuff! CS: Some people have suggested viewers have been confused by the ending because they’ve seen the film at home, on their TVs, while doing other things. JC: When I read the book, I had to go back to it, wondering if I missed something, because it was such a kind of a shock. So I did try to give that experience in the film. I remember when I saw No Country for Old Men I had to keep watching it again because I wasn’t quite sure I’d understood. And I found that rewarding. AW: That experience of slowly realising Phil has died; people aren’t expecting that. CS: The shot of him being shaved in his coffin, eyes slightly open, is amazing. JC: I love that. I saw the eyes slightly open thing in a lot of western photographs of dead people. I really wanted that moment of seeing Phil as a body, not able to control anything any more and being made to look like every other man. Sort of like: oh my God, what is it all about? CS: What is it all about? JC: Hubris. Thinking you can control things. Nope!  The Power of the Dog is on Netflix.
