4/11/2022,"The main Saudi sovereign wealth fund, controlled by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, invested $2 billion in Jared Kushner's new private equity firm six months after Kushner left the White House, where he was a key defender of bin Salman, even though the Saudi fund's investment screening committee expressed serious misgivings, The New York Times reported Sunday night, citing internal documents. Kushner was a senior White House adviser to his father-in-law, former President Donald Trump. The screening committee's four members — current or former heads of Saudi Aramco, Dow Chemical, the Saudi Central Bank, and Saudi Industrial Development Fund — voted unanimously against investing in Kushner's fledging Affinity Fund, citing the ""inexperience"" of its management, an asset management fee that ""seems excessive,"" and the fact that due diligence found the firm's operations ""unsatisfactory in all aspects,"" the Times reports. ""But days later the full board of the $620 billion Public Investment Fund"" overruled the screening panel. At the same time, the screening committee endorsed the fund's $1 billion investment with former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's new Liberty Strategic Capital, the Times reports. Mnuchin's fund is ""focused on cybersecurity, financial technology, and entertainment — all sectors that fit Saudi priorities"" — while Kushner's ""has not publicly disclosed a theme or focus."" Kushner's fund reported $2.5 billion under management, most of which ""appears to be the $2 billion from Saudi Arabia,"" the Times reports, while Liberty Strategic Capital reports raising $2.7 billion from a total of 33 investors. The Saudi investment with Kushner, who ""has little experience or track record in private equity,"" is also ""on more generous terms"" than the smaller investment with Mnuchin, a successful investor before joining the Trump administration, the Times notes. ""Ethics experts say that such a deal creates the appearance of potential payback for Mr. Kushner's actions in the White House — or of a bid for future favor if Mr. Trump seeks and wins another presidential term in 2024,"" the Times reports. Among other things, ""Kushner played a leading role inside the Trump administration defending Crown Prince Mohammed after U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that he had approved the 2018 killing and dismemberment of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi columnist for The Washington Post and resident of Virginia who had criticized the kingdom's rulers.""

4/11/2022,"FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) — Shortly after Riley Briones Jr. arrived in federal prison, he cut his long, braided hair in a symbolic death of his old self. As a leader of a violent gang and just shy of 18, Briones drove the getaway car in a robbery turned deadly on the Salt River-Pima Maricopa Indian Community outside Phoenix in 1994. He was convicted of murder and given a mandatory sentence of life without parole. In prison, he has been baptized a Christian, ministers to other inmates who call him Brother Briones, got his GED and has a spotless disciplinary record, his attorneys say in their latest bid to get the now 45-year-old’s sentence cut short. “He’s clearly on the side of the line where he should be walking free,” said his attorney, Easha Anand. The U.S. Supreme Court opened the door for that possibility with a 2012 ruling that said only the rare, irredeemable juvenile offender should serve life in prison. Over the past decade, most of the 39 defendants in federal cases who received that sentence have gotten a reprieve and are serving far fewer years behind bars. Briones is among those whose life sentences have been upheld. His attorneys attorneys recently petitioned the full 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to give Briones another chance to reduce it. At the same time, more than 60 legal experts and scholars have asked the federal government to cap sentences for juvenile offenders at 30 years, create a committee to review life sentences in the future and reconsider its stance in Briones' case. Prosecutors in Briones' case have until May to respond to the latest petition. They've previously acknowledged he's improved in prison and ultimately expressed remorse but say that's not worthy of early release because he has minimized his role in the “Eastside Crips Rolling 30s” and its crimes that terrorized Salt River amid a surge of gang violence on Native American reservations in the 1990s. Briones' prison sentence started in 1997 after he was convicted in the death of Brian Patrick Lindsay, a Northern Arizona University student who was home for the summer and working a solo shift at a Subway restaurant. Briones drove four other gang members to the restaurant on May 15, 1994, and waited outside. Lindsay was preparing sandwiches when one of the gang members went outside to talk to Briones, came back inside and shot Lindsay in the face. The shooter pumped more bullets into Lindsay as he lay on the floor. The gang took the food and a bank bag with $100. Prosecutors said the murder was the most egregious of the violent crimes that Briones helped plot and carry out on the reservation about 15 miles (24 kilometers) from Phoenix. But there were others that demonstrated a “murderous, unrepentant and unapologetic attitude,” they said, including drive-by shootings and fires set at rival gang members' homes. Briones also was convicted of arson, tampering with a witness and assault with a dangerous weapon. Three of his co-defendants in Lindsay's death were sentenced to life in prison. One cooperated with authorities and received a lesser term. Because Briones was a juvenile at the time of the murder, he was eligible for a resentence after the Supreme Court’s 2012 decision in Miller v. Alabama. It was part of a series of cases in which the court found minors should be treated differently from adults, partly because of a lack of maturity. The February letter seeking reform from the Justice Department pointed to statistics that show the median sentence for adults convicted of murder in the federal system is 20 years — nearly half the median for the juvenile offenders. The agency did not respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press. Briones' case has ping-ponged through courts as laws changed regarding juvenile offenders. A three-judge 9th Circuit panel most recently ruled against Briones, who is enrolled San Carlos Apache and Salt River Pima-Maricopa. The full court could reconsider. Emails and a phone message left for Lindsay's parents were not returned. In a letter to the court during Briones' 2016 resentencing, Sharyn and Brian Lindsay said the passing of time has done little to mend their hearts. “Isn't a lifetime without our son enough without having to go through another court proceeding?” they wrote. They were in the courtroom during the trial when prosecutors played the 911 recording in which Lindsay told dispatchers through a mouthful of blood that he had been shot. “I can still almost hear that tape,” Paul Charlton, one of the prosecutors at the time, recently told The Associated Press. “And if you had been through that trial, if you had seen the callous and remorseless way in which these individuals faced the evidence against them and their lack of remorse at that time, most people would be as I remain today, unsympathetic to Mr. Briones’ arguments.” Bennit Hayes, who served time with Briones at the federal prison in Beaumont, Texas, said he believes Briones is a changed man. He said Briones studied intently, worked hard and encouraged others to lead better lives. “He was the light in the candle that I put up against everything else going forward,"" said Hayes, whose sentence was commuted by President Barack Obama in 2016. Briones now is at the federal prison in metropolitan Phoenix, near Carmen Briones’ home on the Salt River reservation. She said they keep in contact but haven't seen each other since last May because of pandemic restrictions. Releasing Riley Briones from prison would mean they could be a family in a more meaningful way, she said. But whatever the 9th Circuit decides, she said it won’t change who her husband has become. “He’s still going to continue wherever he’s at to minister, to mentor, to be a positive example and give guidance to those who he has contact with,” said Carmen Briones, who is Pascua Yaqui. “We’ve had enough appeals come and go that ... wisdom would tell you just pray and see what happens.” ___ Fonseca covers Indigenous communities on the AP’s Race and Ethnicity team.

4/11/2022,"STORY: Russian forces continued shelling targets in eastern Ukraine on Sunday, as Washington said it would meet Kyiv's request for more military aid by providing ""the weapons it needs"" to defend itself against Russia. Russia has so far failed to take any major cities, but Ukraine says Russia has been gathering its forces in the east for a major assault and has urged people to flee. Since Russia invaded, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has pressed Western powers for military hardware and support, and to punish Moscow with tough sanctions. U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told ABC News Sunday, (quote) ""We're going to get Ukraine the weapons it needs to beat back the Russians, to stop them from taking more cities and towns."" Mounting civilian casualties have triggered widespread international condemnation and new sanctions. Russia calls its attack on Ukraine a “special military operation,” and denies its soldiers have targeted civilians. But a grave with at least two civilian bodies has been found in a village near Kyiv, a Ukrainian official said on Sunday -- the latest such reported discovery since the Russian withdrawal from areas north of the capital. Ludmila Zabaluk, head of the Dmytriv Village Department said dozens of civilian bodies were found in the area. “There were more than 50 dead people. They shot them from close distance. There’s a car where a 17-year-old child was burned, only bones left. A woman had half her head blown off. A bit farther, a man lying near his car was burned alive.” Villagers in the Chernihiv region recalled surviving weeks of shelling by Russian forces from the cellars of their homes. NATALIA TITOVA: “The shelling went through our house. My husband, children, and my daughter-in-law were all in the basement. We all ran out of the basement and started running in different directions, to the road. All the while they were shooting at the neighbours’ houses.” Sullivan said on Sunday he expected Russia's newly appointed general overseeing Ukraine, Aleksandr Dvornikov, to authorize more brutality against Ukrainian civilians.",Politics/Reuters Videos,'Only bones left' -Ukrainians recount attacks,https://news.yahoo.com/only-bones-left-ukrainians-recount-215222465.html
4/11/2022,"BRUSSELS — European Union foreign ministers are meeting to weigh the effectiveness of the bloc’s response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine amid concern about Moscow’s preparations for a major attack in the east. The ministers will hold talks with the International Criminal Court’s Prosecutor-General Karim A.A. Khan as Western pressure mounts to hold to account those responsible for any war crimes in Ukraine. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, who is chairing Monday’s meeting in Luxembourg, deplored what he called the “brutal, brutal aggression” of Russian troops. Borrell, who was in Ukraine over the weekend, says further EU sanctions against Russia “are always on the table.” He says he’s “afraid the Russian troops are massing on the east to launch an attack on the Donbas,” region in the east after Moscow withdrew its forces from around the capital Kyiv last week. ___ KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: — Ukrainian defenders dig in as Russia boosts firepower — Biden, Modi to speak as US presses for hard line on Russia — Ukrainian nuns open their monastery doors to the displaced — US doubts new Russian war chief can end Moscow’s floundering — Analysis: War, economy could weaken Putin’s place as leader — Go to https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine for more coverage ___ OTHER DEVELOPMENTS: LONDON — Britain’s Ministry of Defense says Ukraine has beaten back several assaults by Kremlin forces in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, resulting in the destruction of Russian tanks, vehicles and artillery. In an intelligence update released Monday morning, the ministry says Russian shelling in the two eastern regions is continuing. “Russia’s continued reliance on unguided bombs decreases their ability to discriminate when targeting and conducting strikes, while greatly increasing the risk of civilian casualties,” the ministry said. The ministry also said Russia’s “prior use” of phosphorus munitions in the Donetsk region raises the possibility they may be used in Mariupol as the battle for the city on Ukraine’s south coast intensifies. ___ WELLINGTON, New Zealand — New Zealand will send a military transport plane and a support team of 50 to Europe, as well as give money to Britain to buy weapons, as it significantly steps up its response to the war in Ukraine. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Monday that the C130 Hercules plane would travel throughout Europe to carry much-needed equipment and supplies to key distribution centers. She said the plane wouldn’t fly directly into Ukraine as most military equipment is transported into the country by land. Ardern said her government would also spend an additional 13 million New Zealand dollars ($9 million) on military and human rights support, including NZ$7.5 million for Britain to buy weapons and ammunition. Ardern said that brings New Zealand’s total contribution to the war effort to NZ$30 million ($20 million) with 67 people deployed. ___ LVIV, Ukraine – Ukraine’s president warned his nation Sunday night that the coming week would be as crucial as any in the war. “Russian troops will move to even larger operations in the east of our state,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly address. He accused Russia of trying to evade responsibility for war crimes. “When people lack the courage to admit their mistakes, apologize, adapt to reality and learn, they turn into monsters. And when the world ignores it, the monsters decide that it is the world that has to adapt to them. Ukraine will stop all this,” Zelenskyy said. “The day will come when they will have to admit everything. Accept the truth,” he said. He again called on Western countries, including Germany, to provide more assistance to Ukraine. During talks with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Zelenskyy said he discussed “how to strengthen sanctions against Russia and how to force Russia to seek peace.” “I am glad to note that the German position has recently changed in favor of Ukraine. I consider it absolutely logical,” Zelenskyy said. ___ BERLIN -- Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said he will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Monday. The Austria Press Agency reported that Nehammer told reporters in Vienna on Sunday that he plans to make the journey. It follows a trip on Saturday to Kyiv, where he met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. APA reported that Nehammer aims to encourage dialogue between Ukraine and Russia and also address “war crimes” in his meeting with Putin. Austria is a member of the European Union and has backed the 27-nation bloc’s sanctions against Russia, though it so far has opposed cutting off deliveries of Russian gas. The country is militarily neutral and is not a member of NATO. Nehammer said he was taking the trip on his own initiative, and that he had consulted with the European Union’s top officials. He said that he also informed Zelenskyy and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.",World/Associated Press,Live Updates | EU ministers assessing bloc's response to war,https://news.yahoo.com/live-updates-zealand-sending-transport-060639448.html
