12/29/2021,"Antonio Conte bemoaned Tottenham’s fatigue and foggy thinking as his side failed to make proper inroads to fourth-placed Arsenal after being forced to settle for a draw against 10-man Southampton. Spurs hoped to build on Harry Kane’s first-half equaliser from the penalty spot but had two goals disallowed by the officials, the first for a marginal offside and the second for a supposed foul. Kane replied for Spurs on 41 minutes after the Southampton captain James Ward-Prowse’s third goal in three matches gave the hosts a deserved lead.  Kane had the ball in the net seven minutes after the break but the VAR deemed the England captain offside and, later, Fraser Forster avoided the ignominy of an embarrassing own goal after the Tottenham half-time substitute, Matt Doherty, was penalised for a foul in the buildup. Spurs are now five points behind their north London rivals. “It was an opportunity, but we missed it,” Conte said. “When you have that situation, you have to try to exploit the situation to get three points. We knew very well. The situation at one point of the game was positive for us but I think the second half we felt the fatigue and our mind wasn’t clear to make the best decisions. “I tried also with substitutions to change something, [by bringing on] Lucas Moura in and [Bryan] Gil. I decided to change [Sergio] Reguilón because he was on a yellow card and I think it was much better in this way. We didn’t find a solution. We scored but they decided to disallow the goal.” Conte made three changes from his team’s victory against Crystal Palace on Boxing Day, with Dele Alli, Harry Winks and Ben Davies replacing Moura, Japhet Tanganga and Oliver Skipp. The Italian also confirmed that winger Steven Bergwijn was absent altogether with a calf injury sustained against Palace. “To play after 44 hours is not easy for every team and I think I have seen a bit of fatigue in my players. For this reason, we make sometimes not a good decision in the last pass, the finishing. We can do much better.”",Sport/Football,Spurs’ Antonio Conte says draw against Southampton was ‘missed opportunity’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/28/spurs-antonio-conte-says-draw-against-southampton-was-missed-opportunity
12/29/2021,"Australian football was supposed to be beyond this. 2021-22 was supposed to be the season where everything returned to some semblance of normality. Yet, just when the A-Leagues thought they were out, Omicron pulled them back in. Thanks to a wave of positive tests, enforced isolations, and match postponements, Australian football has settled into the now-familiar comfort of crisis. Across the past week: three FFA Cup games, four ALM games, and one ALW fixture have fallen prey to Covid.  Though the game was eventually abandoned, that the Newcastle Jets were initially set to host Western Sydney Wanderers behind closed doors on Boxing Day carried an air of macabre nostalgia. The Jets defeated Melbourne City in front of empty stands at McDonald Jones Stadium before the season was suspended at the birth of the pandemic in early 2020. Given the parallels, calls for another hiatus, or a return to centralised hubs, are inevitable. In such a rapidly shifting environment, it would appear to make sense to call for a time-out, even just for a week or so, to provide clarity. Leading into the Christmas weekend at least, the possibility of hubs or a suspension to the season were not being considered by the Australian Professional Leagues. Eager to deliver both a full ALM and ALW season in their first campaign in charge, the major priority of the APL, beyond minimising any further spread of Covid amongst players and staff, remains the completion of as many games – and the rescheduling of postponed fixtures – as quickly as possible to both ensure that clubs do not experience a fixture pile-up come the end of the season, and provide more flexibility for the leagues in the event that circumstances worsen or improve. This quest to fit games in at short notice is aided by new broadcast partner Viacom CBS proving a more adaptable partner than Fox Sports. In 2020-21, the looming conclusion of the existing broadcast deal meant that City’s coronation as ALM champions had to take place before the end of June, even with the outbreak of the Delta variant. In contrast, positioning itself as ‘The Home of Australian Football’, Viacom ostensibly have little choice but to do what they can to support APL, lest their brand new investment becomes a lemon less than a year in. While APL chief executive Danny Townsend told the Sydney Morning Herald there is no inclination to extend the length of the season beyond its scheduled end date of May, the existence of this five-year broadcast deal, as well as a newly signed multi-year collective bargaining agreement with Professional Footballers Australia, would remove two significant barriers to the leagues seeking to make adjustments should the postponements begin to pile up. Steadfast as the APL’s intention may appear, the fragile nature of pressing on with a national sporting competition in defiance of a highly communicable virus was laid bare on Sunday when an unnamed member of Melbourne City’s fully vaccinated ALW squad, who lives in a house with a number of her teammates, returned two positive rapid antigen tests the day of her side’s win over Melbourne Victory. City were made to scramble to determine if any other asymptomatic players might also test positive, and figure out a way to prepare for the fixture in a manner that would allow for at least some form of risk minimisation. Beyond the reality of teammate to teammate transmission, ALW presents its own set of unique challenges to administrators. Unlike their fully professional male counterparts, the lack of full-time professionalism and a full home and away season means the majority of ALW players, by sheer economic necessity, work jobs outside of football, increasing their chances of contracting Covid. Indeed, the first ALW player reported during this present wave, a Newcastle Jets player, tested positive after being exposed at her non-football place of employment. The A-Leagues are hardly alone in having their best-laid plans plunged into chaos. Positive cases and postponements have swept the English Premier League in recent weeks and in the face of a deluge of absences, the NFL, perhaps operating on the Trumpian assumption that fewer tests equals fewer COVID, has altered their regimens to drop mandatory testing for fully vaccinated and asymptomatic players and coaches. By contrast, the APL is understood to be investigating means of ramping up testing in the weeks and months ahead. But a vaccination or booster mandate is not yet on the table, with the APL content that with almost every player in the competition already jabbed such a policy isn’t needed. Such a stance is made easier by government policies and private companies, such as airlines, doing some of the heavy lifting. For example, Western United coach John Aloisi confirmed one of his players was unavailable for selection due to his unvaccinated status. Inevitably, the APL will be driven by their own internal metrics and priorities when it comes to formulating plans for how their newly independent properties respond to the latest challenge. But how long any plans will last is a great unknown. Anyone that claims to know exactly what needs to happen in the coming weeks, given that just over a month ago none of us had even heard of Omicron, is doing little more than erecting a petard for themselves.",Sport/Football,Omicron nudges A-Leagues back into familiar comfort of crisis | Joey Lynch,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/29/omicron-nudges-australian-football-into-familiar-comfort-of-crisis
12/29/2021,"Greta Thunberg has criticised Joe Biden for not leading the fight against the climate crisis.  In an interview with the Washington Post, the 18-year old Swedish environmental activist pushed back against the idea of the US president as a leader on climate issues. “It’s strange that people think of Joe Biden as a leader for the climate when you see what his administration is doing,” she said. “The US is actually expanding fossil fuel infrastructure. “Why is the US doing that? It should not fall on us activists and teenagers who just want to go to school to raise this awareness and to inform people that we are actually facing an emergency.” Asked what she wants politicians like Biden to do, Thunberg said: “First of all, we have to understand what is the emergency. “We are trying to find a solution to a crisis that we don’t understand … it’s all about the narrative. It’s all about, what are we actually trying to solve? Is it this emergency, or is it this emergency?” In November, Thunberg called the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow “a failure”, arguing it “turned into a PR event” in which “leaders are not doing anything” except “actively creating loopholes and shaping frameworks” in order to keep profiting from a “destructive system”. Speaking to the Post, Thunberg said that a Cop26 final agreement “which is very much an achievement” will not amount to anything unless it increases ambitions which leaders then fulfill. One of the positives of Cop26, she said, was that it revealed that “under current circumstances, within current systems, we won’t be able to solve the climate crisis unless there is massive pressure from the outside”. Thunberg said global summits like Cop26 presented a “big opportunity” for public mobilization to highlight the climate crisis. In Glasgow, Biden vowed that the US would “lead by example” in the fight to avoid global heating beyond 1.5C. He made new promises to cut down on methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and to end deforestation, drawing widespread praise. Nonetheless, when more than 40 countries announced a promise to end coal mining, the US was absent from the list. In a recent report, the UN environment program and other researchers found that global production of oil and gas is on track to rise over the next 20 years at a rate that will result in double the fossil fuel production in 2030 consistent with a 1.5C rise. The report found that the US projects increases in oil and gas production by 17% and 12% respectively by 2030. The Biden administration has approved at least 3,091 new drilling permits on public lands at a rate of 223 permits a month, at a faster rate than the Trump administration. In November, the US held the largest-ever auction of oil and gas drilling leases in Gulf of Mexico history, offering up more than 80m acres of seabed. Thunberg told the Post: “What’s holding us back is that we lack the political will. “Our goal is to find a solution that allows us to continue life [as it is] today,” she said. “… but the uncomfortable truth is that we have left it too late for that. Or the world leaders have left it too late for that. “We need to fundamentally change our societies now. If we would have started 30 years ago, it would have been smoother. But now it’s a different situation.”",News/Environment,Greta Thunberg says it’s ‘strange’ Joe Biden is considered a climate leader,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/28/greta-thunberg-joe-biden-climate-crisis-fight-leader
12/29/2021,"Galvin, under an inspired ride by Davy Russell, got up in the final stride to win the Grade One Savills Chase at Leopardstown on Tuesday and will now head straight to the Cheltenham Gold Cup in March, when he is likely to start at around 5-1 to give Gordon Elliott, his trainer, a second success in chasing’s championship event. Galvin seemed more likely to finish third when A Plus Tard and Kemboy, the winners in 2020 and 2018 respectively, showed more speed after jumping the second-last, and Elliott’s seven-year-old still had a couple of lengths to find at the final fence.  Russell got a great leap from his partner there, however, and was then able to draw on the stamina which saw Galvin home in front in the National Hunt Chase at Cheltenham in March, closing all the way up the run-in and eventually getting a short-head in front on the line. “I didn’t know where the line was, I was driving with my head down and the further away the line was, the better chance I had,” Russell told RTE television afterwards. “He really motored from the back of the last. He jumped fantastic and he’s game as a pebble.” The win was Russell’s first in a Grade One race since returning to race-riding in August after nearly a year on the sidelines with serious injuries to his neck and back, sustained in a fall at Limerick in October 2020, and Elliott’s first in a Grade One chase since November 2020. “I had a tear in my eye after the race, I’m not afraid to say it,” Elliott, who was banned for six months in March after being photographed posing on a dead horse on his gallops, said afterwards. “We’ve had a rough year and it’s brilliant for the horse to do this. We started out having a bit of fun around Perth with him and he hasn’t let us down the whole way. That’s 12 races he’s won now, he’s the horse of a lifetime. He stays like hell and he’ll go straight to the Gold Cup now.

I’m very lucky to have Davy and Jack [Kennedy] at the moment, that meant a lot to Davy as well as he’s very close to Ronnie [Bartlett, Galvin’s owner]. We don’t let him ride for anyone else at the moment, he’s too good to be giving to anyone else.” Bookmakers reacted to Galvin’s win by cutting him to a top price of 7-1 (from as big as 33-1 on Tuesday morning) for the Gold Cup in March, while A Plus Tard, the runner-up behind Minella Indo in last season’s Gold Cup, is out to 4-1 (from 5-2). Minella Indo is a 10-1 chance while Tornado Flyer, Sunday’s King George VI Chase winner at Kempton, is one of several contenders on offer at around 16-1. Klassical Dream made the most of a flying start to win the Grade One Christmas Hurdle over three miles, as Paul Townend stole half a dozen lengths from his field in the opening moments before holding the strong finish of Flooring Porter by two lengths. The winner, who landed the Supreme Novice Hurdle over two miles at Cheltenham in 2019, was cut to around 5-2 (from 9-2) for the Stayers’ Hurdle at the Festival in March while Flooring Porter, a front-running winner of that race last season, is a 7-1 chance. “It wasn’t part of the plan,” Willie Mullins, Klassical Dream’s trainer, said. “We were expecting pace in the race but obviously it wasn’t there. Paul said the horse took the initiative, jumped out the gate and went. The horse took over and did everything.” Mullins competed a double when Galopin Des Champs ran away with the card’s Beginners’ Chase, finishing 22 lengths clear of the runner-up. The winner, a 6-1 shot for the Brown Advisory Novice Chase at the Cheltenham Festival before jumping a fence in public, is now 9-4 favourite, with Bravemansgame, who took the Grade One Kauto Star Novice Chase at Kempton on Sunday, next in the list at 4-1.",Sport/Sport,Galvin has Gordon Elliott in tears after last-gasp Savills Chase victory,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/28/galvin-has-gordon-elliott-in-tears-after-last-gasp-savills-chase-victory-horse-racing
12/29/2021,"Care services in the community could be rationed amid the spread of Omicron, which is causing staff absences in England’s public services to rocket. Choices will need to be made about what services can and cannot be covered, according to Patricia Marquis, the England director of the Royal College of Nursing.  “Services are already really stretched and it won’t take a lot – either further staff absences or increasing numbers of patients needing to be seen because the hospitals are full – to really push the services over the edge,” she said. Marquis predicts that as services begin to reopen after Christmas, it will become clearer how much more pressure they are facing. Community nursing is a particular area of concern and those services could end up being rationed, Marquis said. “Everyone automatically thinks about hospitals, but staff shortages aren’t just affecting hospitals. Limiting the number of community services that are available will possibly need to be considered.” Stephen T Chandler, president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, also warned that social care provided in people’s homes could be badly hit by the Omicron wave. “In some places, people are having to wait longer to be discharged from hospital or may be waiting longer for people to come out and assess them. In some instances, it will result in some services being unavailable in the short term and that’s what we mean by rationing,” he said. A day care facility in Oxfordshire has already had to temporarily close due to staff shortages, he said. Homecare is likely to be badly affected, as it is harder to redeploy staff. “The best-case scenario would be a stranger would come into your home who is not familiar with your care and the worst case is the number of visits having to be reduced,” he said. Chandler said care provided in the community plays a crucial role in protecting the NHS as it can reduce the number of people visiting hospital. “This is why it is so critical that you don’t have anything happening that would risk that,” he said. Meanwhile, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the council of the British Medical Association, warned that GPs are being hit by staff shortages and said the government’s focus solely on hospitalisation data when making decisions about further Covid restrictions was shortsighted. Nagpaul said: “To me the elephant in the room is the alarming levels of NHS staff shortages, and hospital data do not include general practice, which is being impacted significantly.” The BMA has been told that large numbers of appointments are being cancelled as a result. “We’re also seeing cancellation of clinics for blood tests, for example where nurses are off sick. Reception staff are also going off sick, which means phones are going unanswered.” When people can’t get GP appointments, A&E visits usually increase, so there is a knock-on effect on hospitals. “The government’s focus purely on hospital absence and Omicron hospitalisation is missing the larger picture of the impact on general practice, which is for patients that first point of contact.” Public transport also continues to experience pressure due to Covid-related staff shortages. The Rail Delivery Group, the British rail industry membership body, said that on Monday 6.8% of trains were cancelled, up from an average of 5.4% in the seven days to Friday 24 December. The annual average of cancellations is 2.9%. A spokesperson said: “Our staff are working in difficult circumstances and, like everyone else, they are susceptible to the virus.” Waste collection services also continue to be disrupted in some areas of the country, with Basingstoke and Deane borough council having had to announce on Christmas Eve that some collections may not take place owing to Covid-related staffing issues. Bin collections for Cambridge and South Cambridgeshire between Christmas and the new year also had to be revised, with some collection dates delayed by five days. Green bin collections in the area were suspended from 13 December due to the number of absent drivers and loaders, particularly due to Covid-19 or self-isolation, the Greater Cambridge Shared Waste Service said, with rounds not due to return to normal before 24 January.",News/Society,Community care services could be rationed in England,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/28/community-care-services-could-be-rationed-in-england
