4/20/2022,"He’s better known for stepping out on stage and providing some of the most memorable British pop moments in recent memory, but now Robbie Williams is swapping the microphone and the spotlight for an easel as he presents his first ever exhibition. Williams and his creative partner, Ed Godrich, are presenting an exhibition of their black-and-white paintings and curating a sale at Sotheby’s that will feature some of their favourite artists, including Jean-Michel Basquiat, Grayson Perry and Damien Hirst. The pair’s love of street art, which created their bond and inspired their paintings, is the thread that runs through their exhibition and the sale. Godrich and Williams’s Black and White Paintings exhibition will be on show at Sotheby’s New Bond Street galleries from 13-25 May, while their Contemporary Curated sale runs from 22-28 April and includes works by graffiti writer turned art world star Basquiat, and street artist Richard Hambleton. The pair describe the Canadian-born New York-based Hambleton – who uses brushes and black paint in pots to create “immense human shadows” – as “the daddy” of them all and a huge influence on their work. “He was at the forefront of a revolution that has continued to this day. To own a Richard Hambleton, acknowledges your deep understanding of street art,” they said. Williams and Godrich, who co-founded the interior architecture studio Godrich Interiors, said they went into “a meditative trance-like state” when they created their own work, and that it was not uncommon for them to forget painting certain parts of the canvas. “There are references to so many things buried in the layers of each work, some private, some not. On closer inspection each viewer will perceive the content in a totally different way,” they said. In total, 14 of the duo’s works will be on display at the exhibition, with Williams and Godrich creating the paintings while listening to music (often Annie Mac’s DJ sets) in their Los Angeles studio that they share. Other work in their curated sale includes the spot painting, 2- Hydroxypyridine by Damien Hirst, whom they describe as “a mischievous scamp”, and Grayson Perry’s self-portrait ceramics piece Him and Her. “The intriguing thing about this piece is it covers so many areas of Grayson’s creativity. We all need a ceramic of Grayson and a pink creature in our lives,” they said. “Without Grayson, it all feels a fraction normal.” Williams, an early investor in Banksy, has dabbled in the art market before. In January he put up three works by Banksy from his private collection for a combined estimate of £10m. At the time he said the aim of selling Girl with Balloon, Vandalised Oils (Choppers) and Kissing Coppers was to free up space to be able to buy “new art from new people” and help fund his own work. The former Take That singer first told fans about his love for art in 2011. In a blog post on his official website, he said that he was inspired by Jackson Pollock and Andy Warhol and had taken up the practice during the group’s down time. Williams reportedly created 40 large works during the Covid-19 lockdowns, and recently sold greetings card-sized artworks to help promote his new gallery, which doubles as a nightclub that he described as “the opposite of Studio 54, which was exclusive and pretentious”. Godrich and Williams said: “We are proud of what we have created and it is time to share what has been coming out of our brains for the last few years. Doing an exhibition gives the work a chance to breathe outside of the studio.”",Arts/Music,Robbie Williams to exhibit his paintings for first time ,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/20/robbie-williams-ed-godrich-exhibit-paintings-for-first-time
4/20/2022,"Among the many intriguing subplots to have arisen from the Ukraine invasion has been the widespread expulsion of Russian “diplomats” from European embassies. Reflecting the trend, the cover design for this week’s Guardian Weekly magazine captures a creeping anxiety across Europe, where Russian “diplomats” have more latterly been seen as agents of division and disinformation. As Patrick Wintour writes, the expulsions are not just a symbolic act of revulsion at Moscow’s activities but part of a decades-long battle to balance Russian espionage with diplomacy. The west has been accused of neglecting a recent rise in clandestine Russian activities – in the light of the invasion, is it all too little, too late? In Warsaw, Nick Ames joined thousands of Ukrainians as the football club Dynamo Kyiv began a series of “matches for peace”. And Luke Harding reports from the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, where a clean-up operation has tentatively begun in the wake of the departing Russian forces. Before the invasion, a scandal involving Covid lockdown gatherings very nearly cut short the career of Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson. Now, after a lengthy police investigation, Johnson has been issued with a penalty charge for attending an illegal gathering that he previously insisted to parliament did not break the law. With more fines expected, Michael Savage and Shanti Das ask whether is Johnson on the ropes again – or has the Tory rebellion died down, for the time being at least? Our features pages contain plenty of delights this week. From train stations to hospital waiting rooms, vending machines are so ubiquitous that we barely notice them. But how much do we really know about these everyday sentinels of snack food? Tom Lamont takes a deep dive into the indispensable world of automated dispensers.

4/20/2022,"Most climate-change documentaries sound pre-emptive warnings about the consequences if we fail to take action. But this essential cine-essay by Emmanuel Cappellin – a former cinematographer for Yann-Arthus Bertrand – instead takes as its starting point the idea that all is already lost. That, as Cappellin concluded as a nature-obsessed young researcher, whatever projection you choose, capitalism is destined to deplete its resources and collapse within a few decades. If that sounds depressing, it is. This mournful piece, with the despairing Cappellin looking for answers, consults a series of Cassandras, in the shape of a number of environmentalists and collapsologists prognosticating about whether, and how, mankind can adapt. In post-crisis Greece, examining the country’s potential as a possible laboratory for degrowth, journalist Richard Heinberg wonders about the future: “Are we better off not knowing?” Actually, Cappellin decides, we are not. Where his documentary breaks ground is the curt pragmatism that takes hold. As Bangladeshi climate scientist Saleemul Huq says, it is now the duty of every individual to locate the “emotional trigger point” of what climate change means in their life, so we can decide precisely how to react. Recalling William Gibson’s comment about the future already being here, just not evenly distributed, Bangladesh – with every new cyclone – is currently on the frontline of working out these parameters. Cappellin looks to its villagers for pointers on the mentality needed to evolve. He hits on the notion of the resilient network: rather than the squirrel-munching American lone survivalist, small groups of people using their skills in concert will be best-equipped to adapt. The hope is that the low-key but high-functioning democratic ethos this would lead to – being tested in the refugee-welcoming French village he moves to – would put mankind on a different path to the elitist despoiling and hoarding that got us into this predicament. Once You Know goes even further than the kind of programmes offered up in the likes of Cyril Dion and Melanie Laurent’s big French eco-hit Tomorrow from 2015. Ultimately, it suggests that, after the resource-pillaging growth frenzy of the past two centuries, we need to go philosophical cold turkey, appreciating limits, finitude, and even contemplating the possibility of failure. “To confront this terrifying reality we’re talking about is like confronting your own ending,” says scientist Susanne Moser, gazing out on to storm-wracked waves. Cappellin’s film is a radical, sobering and overdue confrontation.  Once You Know is released on 22 April on digital platforms.",Arts/Film,Once You Know review – must-watch essay on climate change that tells us it’s already here,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/20/once-you-know-review-must-watch-essay-on-climate-change-that-tells-us-its-already-here
4/20/2022,"In 2000, Ian Winwood, a longstanding writer for hard rock magazine Kerrang! – was sent to interview an up-and-coming rock band. He liked them immediately, recognised their potential and struck up a friendship with them. He watched, delighted, from various degrees of proximity, as they rose in popularity – sold-out shows, platinum albums, a very real chance of breaking America – then looked on aghast as things started to go wrong. The lead singer became an egotistical liability, developing a drug problem that made him unreliable, alienated him from his bandmates and caused his teeth to start falling out. The size of the venues they played began to shrink, America turned its attentions elsewhere, relations between the singer and the rest of the band soured into violent altercations backstage. Their time in the sun was drawing to a close: some members began discussing splitting up, then possibly returning to catch a wave of nostalgia, playing their old hits as a “pension plan”. That should have been that, but it wasn’t. The group were Lostprophets, the lead singer Ian Watkins. Before the band had the chance to split, he was charged with, and ultimately convicted of, conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with minors and possession of indecent images of children and “extreme” animal pornography. The saga of Ian Watkins is, by some distance, the most shocking in Bodies, a book filled with shocking stories. The details feel exceptionally ghastly, even by the grim standards of rock star depravity. But for Winwood, it’s also a telling story: Watkins’s bandmates and management were aware that he had problems, and had attempted to help, but had no idea how bad things actually were, because the problems they thought Watkins had were so commonplace within the music industry, where drug addiction and “gruelling and maddeningly dysfunctional behaviour” are normalised. “The reason the Lostprophets failed to identify the presence of something uniquely vile within their ranks,” he writes, “was because Ian Watkins could take his pick of routine ruinations behind which he could so easily hide.” This is Bodies’ central thesis. The music industry has long allowed abnormal behaviour to become normalised, even celebrated. From Keith Richards to Kurt Cobain, fans tend to buy into a mythologising of addiction and illness, either enamoured by “the image of musician as outlaw” or some vague notion that “capable art should be underwritten by human suffering”. Behind this preposterously romantic, transgressive image lurks personal horror and tragedy, which Winwood recounts unsparingly, but with authentic empathy: the story of his own drink-and-drug fuelled collapse, which results in several stays in psychiatric hospitals, is woven through the book. There’s the bassist who severs a femoral artery while injecting drugs into his groin and watches as his toes turn black and drop off (his leg is later amputated); the grim fates that befell the frontmen of literally every major Seattle grunge band save Pearl Jam’s Eddie Vedder; the frail and oddly melancholy figure cut by Motörhead’s ostensibly defiant frontman Lemmy in his final years, with his evident regrets and his voice marked by “the aerosol-can rattle of someone thirsty for air”. It’s a situation compounded by a noticeable lack of duty of care on the part of management and record companies. Bodies relates a number of incidents where an artist is pushed or feels impelled to work despite being clearly unwell, sometimes with terrible consequences. With the royalty split from streaming simultaneously filling record labels’ coffers while decimating musicians’ capacity to earn from recordings – labels earned £1bn from streaming last year, while an artist needs 7,343,157 streams per month just to generate the UK’s minimum wage – the only way to make money is to tour relentlessly. That means longer periods living in an unreal environment where drink and drugs are ever-present, bad behaviour is indulged and where, at the lower end of the ladder, working conditions sound enough to make even the most level-headed musician consider rendering themselves insensible. Bodies’ description of life on the Vans Warped Tour – a coast-to-coast travelling punk rock festival that Winwood calls “a working model of hell on earth” – is genuinely eye-popping, a brutal corrective to the idea that life in a band is infinitely less trying than a “proper job” and that everyone involved should stop whining and count their blessings. Finally tipped over the edge, one British band’s drummer attempts to stab their guitarist during an argument over a spilled beer. “That wasn’t out of the ordinary,” comments another band member. “That was normal behaviour … shit like that was happening all over the site.” It should be a harrowing read, and it frequently is: that it doesn’t make you despair entirely is down to Winwood’s skill as a prose stylist. He makes a compelling argument and overturns some long-held notions about “rock and roll excess” by deftly tying together a vast amount of information – from first-hand accounts to interviews with psychologists – and liberally lacing it with dark, self-deprecating humour. It’s clearly a book with limitations: Winwood sticks with the world he knows best – heavy metal, hard rock and punk predominate – which means the vast majority of the interviewees are male and almost all are white. But what he’s saying seems universally applicable: there’s no way of telling directly from Bodies if things are different in, say, the world of hip-hop, but the mortality rate among young rappers strongly suggests they’re not. It ends relatively happily, with its author sober, stable and married, and with some faint glimmers of hope on the horizon for the music world. The conversation about mental health has become more public in recent years, although Winwood notes sharply that the music industry’s willingness to have that conversation seems “contingent on it not interfering with the workings of an unjust business model”. It’s telling that the most pro-active organisation Bodies describes is a charity partly funded by musicians themselves, which plans to set up hubs in venues and provide a kind of mental health MOT to audience members and performers alike. Whether it works remains to be seen, but at least someone’s doing something.  Bodies: Life and Death in Music by Ian Winwood is published by Faber & Faber (£14.99).

4/20/2022,"Prince Harry has said the Queen was “on great form” during their recent meeting, and that he wanted to make sure she had “the right people around her”. Speaking to NBC’s Today Show about his meeting with the monarch, Harry said: “Being with her it was great, it was just so nice to see her, she’s on great form.” Harry and his wife, Meghan, also met the Prince of Wales, having arrived from their home in the US before travelling to the Netherlands for the Invictus games, which the duke founded and is now a private patron. Harry said of the Queen: “She’s always got a great sense of humour with me and I’m just making sure that she’s protected and got the right people around her. “Both Meghan and I had tea with her, so it was really nice to catch up with her.” The duke added that although he enjoyed visiting the UK and seeing his grandmother, his home remained in the US. “Home for me now, for the time being, is in the States and it feels that way,” he said “We’ve been welcomed with open arms and have such a great community up in Santa Barbara.” The couple moved to California after their decision to step down as senior royals in 2020, saying that they wanted a new life of personal and financial freedom. The duke’s visit to the UK is his third since March 2020. The Queen, who celebrates her 96th birthday on Thursday, has had to pull out of several events, including a church service on Easter Sunday, owing to mobility problems. The Invictus Games, which concludes on Friday, involves 500 injured or unwell military personnel and veterans from across 20 nations who compete in a week of adaptive sports. Harry is currently taking legal action against the government over his police protection in the UK.
