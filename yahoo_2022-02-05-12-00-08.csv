2/5/2022,"Researchers have identified a variant of HIV that progresses to AIDS twice as quickly as past versions. People infected with the VB variant also have higher viral loads, making them more likely to transmit to others. Existing antiretroviral treatments for HIV still work against the newfound variant. A highly aggressive and contagious variant of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been silently spreading in the Netherlands for decades, and researchers have finally identified it. Like the coronavirus, the virus that causes AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) has mutated into a slew of variants — some more dangerous than others. The newfound variant, called VB, appears to progress about twice as quickly as closely related strains. Individuals infected with the VB variant are likely to develop AIDS within two to three years after diagnosis if they don't receive treatment, rather than the typical six- to seven-year progression, researchers wrote in the journal Science. This striking example of viral evolution has implications for the COVID-19 pandemic, wrote Joel Wertheim, associate professor of medicine at the University of California, San Diego, in a perspective published alongside the findings on Thursday. ""We should never underestimate the potential for viral evolution,"" Wertheim, who was not involved in the study, told NPR. ""Let this study stand in stark contrast to the claim that all viruses will inevitably evolve to be benign."" All variants of HIV attack the immune system in a similar fashion. The virus latches onto CD4 cells (also known as T cells), a type of white blood cell that leads the charge against infection, and causes them to swell and burst. Researchers found that the VB variant explodes those cells twice as quickly, leading to a swifter decline in immune function. Once the CD4 count dips below a certain level, that person is considered immunocompromised with AIDS and is therefore prone to life-threatening infections. While working on the BEEHIVE project — an initiative to understand how HIV has and continues to evolve — researchers noticed that 17 individuals had especially high viral loads early in infection. Fifteen of those individuals were from the Netherlands, and the other two were from Switzerland and Belgium. After studying another 92 people infected with the VB variant, researchers determined that the viral load tends to be three or four times higher than typical HIV infections. More virus in the body means the host is more contagious to others, lead author Chris Wymant told NPR. Fortunately, the standard antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV still work to stop the transmission and progression of the VB variant, he said. If taken consistently, the medication can lower the viral load to an undetectable level, so many people with HIV can live normal and healthy lives.

 A defendant who faces multiple charges connected to the Jan. 6, 2021, storming of the Capitol is asking to subpoena former President Trump, among others, as a trial witness. Attorney Samuel Shamansky on Friday submitted court filings on behalf of his client, Jan. 6 defendant Dustin Thompson, asking for a judge to allow them to subpoena Trump and others to testify as witnesses in Thompson's trial. ""Defendant submits that the individuals he seeks to subpoena are in exclusive possession of information relevant to this case. Moreover, their testimony is necessary to ensure that Defendant's constitutional right to present a complete defense is safeguarded,"" according to the court filings. ""It is anticipated that, when called as a witness, Donald J. Trump will testify that he and others orchestrated a carefully crafted plot to call into question the integrity of the 2020 presidential election and the validity of President Biden's victory,"" the filings add. ""Moreover, it will be established at trial that Mr. Trump and his conspirators engaged in a concerted effort to deceive the public, including Defendant, into believing that American democracy was at stake if Congress was permitted to certify the election results."" The court filings indicate that if Trump and others were compelled to testify in Thompson's trial, their testimony would show that they had wanted to prevent Congress from certifying the 2020 presidential election results. ""Defendant submits that the testimony of Mr. Trump and his conspirators will establish that they were determined, by any means necessary, to prevent Congress from fulfilling its constitutional mandate to certify the election results,"" the court filings said. ""In order to accomplish that goal, the conspirators Defendant now seeks to subpoena engaged in a concerted effort to organize, encourage, and direct rally participants to storm the Capitol, enter the grounds, 'fight like hell,' and 'engage in trial by combat."" Shamansky said some of the other witnesses they would like to subpoena include former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, former White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon, conservative lawyer John Eastman, pro-Trump lawyer Sidney Powell and Donald Trump Jr.  Thompson's attorney says he expects an opinion to be made soon, but he acknowledged that they may face legal challenges ahead even if the request is approved. ""If and when Judge Walton approves our issues for a subpoena, we fully expect Trump and his co-conspirators to utilize every legal trick in the book to avoid being placed under oath,"" Shamansky said. Thompson faces a string of charges associated with the Jan. 6 attack, when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol and tried to stop Congress from certifying the 2020 presidential election.  The defendant has been charged with obstruction of an official proceeding and aiding and abetting; theft of government property; entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds; disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds; disorderly conduct in a Capitol building and parading, demonstrating or picketing in a Capitol building. According to Thompson's statement of facts and complaint, security footage inside the Capitol allegedly showed him inside the building holding a bottle of bourbon. The court filings also allege that he ran away from law enforcement after he was found with a coat rack that officials believed was inside the Capitol.
