3/29/2022,"Without question, Sunday night’s Oscars were the ugliest in history. By physically assaulting a performer onstage, Will Smith managed to cause irreparable damage to the ceremony. And the outright failure of the show’s producers and guests to chastise Smith, or even fully acknowledge his attack, has thrown the entire Academy into disrepute. However, if you squint hard enough and look at it from just the right angle, it might have been just the thing that the Oscars needed. First, some perspective. This year’s Oscars needed to be a hit. Last year’s Covid ceremony was watched, by some degree, by far fewer people than any other Oscars in history. This was in part due to circumstance – no big films had been released due to Covid, and the big stars were understandably reluctant to all go and breathe on each other in an enclosed space – but also due to the event itself. Held in a train station, it was brisk and brief and shorn of all clips and jokes. It was not in any way fun to watch, so nobody watched it. But it was also indicative of a wider decline. In 1998, the Oscars were watched by 57 million people. By 2004 that number had dropped to 43 million. In 2015 it had 37 million. In 2018 it had 26 million. In 2020, the last ceremony to happen pre-Covid, the Oscars could only muster a lowly 23 million. This isn’t news, because everyone knows why. The Oscars are too long, too boring, too smug, too irrelevant. And for the most part, that’s how Sunday’s Oscars were, too. Almost every modernising change that took place during the ceremony failed hard. All the technical awards happened before the televised ceremony, but almost all of them were won by Dune, which is the only nominated film that people were actually likely to have seen. Some of the time was ceded to “fan favourite” movies voted for by the public, but the segment was inevitably Boaty McBoatfaced by a handful of hardcore Zack Snyder zealots, which meant that Hollywood’s most prestigious night had to grind to a halt so that everyone could watch the Flash enter the Speed Force. It goes on. The much-hyped performance of We Don’t Talk About Bruno from Encanto ended up being a completely different song about how great the Oscars are. The In Memoriam bit ended up being Jamie Lee Curtis holding a little dog and reading a eulogy while a choir sang Spirit in the Sky behind her. The whole thing was inept, and looked set to go down as yet another punishing snoozefest. And then Will Smith hit Chris Rock. And people started to talk about the Oscars again. Social media, talk shows, news programmes; they all lit up trying to process exactly what happened. Visits to the liveblog I wrote during the ceremony – which was doing just fine before the incident, by the way – exploded by 3,000% after the slap. By playing host to one man losing his mind (and possibly his career) in real time, the Oscars has snatched back some of its cultural power. Ratings were still the second lowest ever, but people are actually talking about the Oscars again. When was the last time that happened? But let’s be sensible. In all likelihood, the slap won’t translate to a ratings bump next year. The closest equivalent in recent memory was probably when Janet Jackson’s top came off during the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show. Ratings for the following year’s show actually dipped a little. And that was pre-YouTube, remember. Now everyone knows that all the juicy stuff will be packaged up and stuck online, that’s where they’re likely to watch it. At time of writing, the Guardian’s video of the slap has been watched by more than four times the number of Americans who watched the ceremony. And while the full ceremony was far more indicative of the queasy, uncomfortable chaos caused by Will Smith’s stupidity, why sit through a four-hour awards show when you can watch the good stuff happen in just 84 seconds? The bigger question is whether any of us want to live in a world where this is how the Oscars regain the cultural conversation. Cheap violence might be thrilling in the moment, but it tarnishes everything around it. The Oscars might be a steadily declining irrelevance with a rapidly approaching sell-by date, but that’s much more preferable than it becoming The Jerry Springer Show.",Arts/Film,"If it takes Will Smith’s slap to make people watch the Oscars, is it doomed? | Stuart Heritage",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/29/oscars-will-smith-slap-chris-rock-doomed
3/29/2022,"The cinema of overachievement has a sharp new entry to add to the likes of Black Swan and Whiplash in this stylishly directed psychodrama set in the world of varsity rowing. It’s played out in the confines of spindly competitive boats, but debut writer-director Lauren Hadaway is making a broader point about the obsessive-compulsive drive towards success in American society, anchored in a superb performance from Isabelle Fuhrman as relentless novice rower Alex. Freshman Alex, physically slighter than many of her fellow athletes, seems to lack the right stuff as a top-level rower. But with the same dogged attitude that’s led her to major in her worst subject, physics, she resolves to push her limits and starts to impress her coach Pete (Jonathan Cherry), who initially can’t remember her name. So she is invited to the chilly 5am lakeside to train with the varsity leaguers – along with fellow novice Jamie (Amy Forsyth) who, from a humbler background, needs the scholarship that a place on the team would give her more than Alex does. Hadaway excels at putting us at the heart of Alex’s febrile focus, with tactile closeups of details in the grotto-like training room and cacophonous sound design in which Pete’s drills (“Legs-body-arms”) percolate in to her mind and on to the soundtrack. Hadaway turns this impressionism inside-out in moments of intensity and exultation, like the spotlit void into which Alex falls during a time-trial on the machine, or a silky early-morning lake outing serenaded by Connie Francis. The increasingly fixated and alienated student starts seeing crabs (a reference to the rowing term for losing control of your oar) everywhere and envisioning her rivals with crow’s heads (the team insignia). While the film never loses its bloody-fingered grasp of the emotional moment, it falls short on a broader psychological level. Alex is a presidential scholar, so has no material reason to chase the varsity place. But the film maintains a wilful vagueness about what it is that’s driving her, and doesn’t seek to Freudsplain her. With little beyond training and races, the drama has a grinding quality that Alex’s affair with an assistant teacher Dani (Dilone) does little to alleviate. Still, it’s hard to deny Fuhrman’s pinch-faced vehemence and the film’s hallucinatory verve.  The Novice is released in cinemas and on digital platforms on 1 April.",Arts/Film,The Novice review – trippy rowing drama with echoes of Whiplash,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/29/the-novice-review-trippy-rowing-drama-with-echoes-of-whiplash
3/29/2022,"Adders and slowworms will be among animals given extra protection under plans by the government to “streamline” the process for protecting nature-rich areas. George Eustice, the environment secretary, said that he plans for brownfield and urban sites to be given greater protection as he scraps sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs) and special protected areas (SPAs), in order to replace them with a streamlined system. Speaking at the environment all-party parliamentary group’s annual reception in parliament, the minister said that most animals protected under the current rules, which stop most development and protect the areas from neglect, are those that are rare across the EU. Eustice said this leaves some species out, such as adders and slow-worms, which are common in some EU countries but rare in England. Eustice said the UK’s exit from the EU meant England would be able to tailor protections to its native wildlife. “The designations we have for species at the moment are in the annex to the habitats directive,” he said. “These are very much built around species that are under threat on an EU-wide basis. And so it doesn’t include, for instance, things like the adder or slowworms, species that nationally probably have a lot of pressures on them. “And perhaps we ought to be doing more for them, but at the moment, they’re not protected in the same way, because they have got habitat ranges elsewhere in the EU, and we probably need to just think afresh about what we’re trying to protect and why we’re doing it.” Many animals, such as slowworms, lizards, adders and types of rare insect thrive in urban areas and brownfield sites, which often are targeted for development. Eustice said that the new designations are likely to include some of these, as many animals that rely on brownfields are at risk of becoming extinct. He said: “Brownfield sites are important for slowworms in particular, and even bats. Often some of these derelict brownfield sites can be quite rich habitat. So it’s a bit of a paradox in that we often say we want to build in brownfield sites not greenfield but paradoxically, some of those derelict brownfield sites … have got more to offer by way of ecology than a greenfield that’s been farmed.” Those being looked at include old mining areas, he said, adding: “You have these sites that have been derelict for around 50 years and often they do become quite a special habitat.” While these words will probably be welcomed by conservation charities, there are concerns that the current system is under-resourced, with SSSIs and SPAs falling into disrepair. This raises questions over how any expansion of an already under-funded scheme would work. Nature charities are currently working on their response to the government’s plans to reform these protections. Crucially, they argue that more funding is needed. The RSPB is working alongside other conservation groups to formulate a response. A spokesperson said: “Around half of our SSSIs and SPAs were found to have had no monitoring in over six years, and a large number of those that are monitored are in poor condition. So, any review of these sites needs to be accompanied by a commitment to quality. “What matters is that we protect the best places for nature wherever they are – and critically that we then manage them properly as neglect is the biggest problem these sites have got at the moment.” Eustice said said SPAs and SSSIs are a “confused set of designations”. “What’s happened over the years is areas are double designated. Sometimes we designated an SAC and found we didn’t have the powers to manage it, so double-designated it an SSSI. We need areas that are much more designated to specific sites, we need to streamline the process.” Natural England, the government body which manages these sites, has for years been underfunded, with conservation charities warning that it is overstretched and unable to manage current sites, let alone create and look after new ones. The agency’s budget was cut by more than half in a decade, from £242m in 2009-10 to £100m for 2017-18. Staff numbers were slashed from 2,500 to an estimated 1,500. This, insiders said at the time, made it very difficult to monitor and steward protected areas. However, it was given a 47% funding uplift last year, and environment journal Ends Report said on Monday that another funding boost is in the works.",News/Environment,Adders and slowworms to gain extra protection under new system in England,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/29/adders-and-slowworms-to-gain-extra-protection-under-new-system-in-england
3/29/2022,"It may be a touch unfair – albeit good fun – to imagine the Succession screenwriters are overseeing the Rugby Football Union’s transition to life after Eddie Jones. No prizes for guessing who fulfils the Logan Roy role and there seem parallels too, between Kendall and Steve Borthwick, someone who has at times appeared the natural successor but about whom doubts over his suitability to be top dog have lingered. Sometimes though, life at the RFU can seem stranger than fiction. The chief executive, Bill Sweeney, and the performance director, Conor O’Shea, were last week at pains to point out that there is a robust succession plan in place. It is apparently called Project Everest, there is a “war room” that features “contracts and all sorts of things” relating to potential candidates and the RFU wants to appoint an Englishman. Ideally, an entire English coaching team and the plan would be to make the appointment next summer. They may well work under Jones in the run-up to the 2023 World Cup and apparently he is happy at the prospect. It is also criteria which, on the face of it, makes Andy Farrell a far harder appointment to make given his current commitments. If the Succession comparison is a stretch so, too, is the RFU’s suggestion that such a model has worked in France recently and can therefore be copied. Fabien Galthié was, in April of 2019, announced as Jacques Brunel’s successor after the World Cup later that year and joined his coaching staff in May. The comparisons should stop there, however, because Brunel was a stop-gap appointment, out of his depth and in need of support. France were an unholy mess during the 2019 Six Nations and already the priority was the 2023 World Cup which they will host. Jones, on the other hand, would not countenance someone exerting as much influence from the back seat as Galthié did and the RFU cannot afford to treat next year’s tournament as a free hit. The insistence on making an appointment in advance of next year’s World Cup is largely to avoid bedding-in problems before the 2024 Six Nations. But that in turn raises the question as to why that championship is more important than the one just gone given the obvious preoccupation with the World Cup already. Maybe a more accurate comparison is with the Football Association in the early 2000s. Sven-Göran Eriksson was appointed as the first foreign England manager to replace Kevin Keegan, a popular figure but ultimately exposed at that level. Eriksson’s successor was Steve McClaren – the FA lurching back to the homegrown route – but after that appointment proved disastrous, Fabio Capello was chosen. In a similar vein to Keegan, Stuart Lancaster departed after his limitations were laid bare before the RFU pursued an overseas solution. They seem intent now, on an English appointment next year but if that does not work out, what price a heavy-hitter from abroad in the form of Warren Gatland or Rassie Erasmus? The RFU’s stated plan is for long-term succession. O’Shea talks a good game and speaks of collaboration with clubs, of a seamless progression of coaches through the ranks so that there is no need for chief executives to jet off to Cape Town with blank cheques to ensure they get their man. But the RFU must forgive the cynicism given how regularly the messaging and the stated ambition has changed since Jones was appointed by Ian Ritchie in late 2015. The fact that Sweeney is the fourth chief executive Jones has worked under hardly helps and only reinforces the idea that ultimately it is he who wields the power, but even the incumbent head of the RFU struck a significantly different tone when discussing succession in 2019 before the World Cup. In fairness to Sweeney, he was not long in the role and dealing with a situation that was not his making. When Jones was appointed he saw having his assistants ready to take over as a “fundamental part of my job”. That never materialised – you could argue the assistants are just as much to blame but the turnover rate of them suggests the problem lies elsewhere and muddying the waters was Jones’s desire to coach the British & Irish Lions in 2021. It was part of the reason he was given a two-year extension through to 2021 by Ritchie’s successor, Steve Brown – but Jones publicly put his foot in it and ended any hopes of the Lions chiefs looking beyond Warren Gatland. Still, Jones was supposed to stay on until 2021 but take a back seat on the 2020 tour of Japan as the successor was brought up to speed. That tour, of course, never happened due to Covid, Jones had decided after the 2019 World Cup that he had another four-year cycle in him and Sweeney, having seen England reach the final in Japan, duly obliged. Prior plans were shelved, John Mitchell abruptly left the building, Project Everest was spawned and Jones – despite consecutive torrid Six Nations campaigns – still has the backing of the RFU and almost certainly will do through to the end of England’s involvement at the 2023 World Cup. Which brings us back to Borthwick, who, you sense was the man the RFU had in mind, way back in 2016, when Jones was supposed to bring through a successor. He is the coach who ticks all the boxes for the RFU at present and, though the union has cooled on the idea that Jones’s replacement must have international experience, Borthwick does from his time in Japan. His coaching stock continues to rise at Leicester but he can come across as robotic – more automaton than autocrat. Senior figures at the RFU have acknowledged as much in the past but he is likely to be prominent on a list that could also include Richard Cockerill, who has kept his powder conspicuously dry for one so usually forthright since joining Jones’s coaching staff. The trouble for Sweeney and O’Shea is that, for all their talk of homegrown succession planning there are not many names to add to the shortlist. Rob Baxter has never really appeared interested and arguably the strongest two candidates – a rejuvenated Lancaster and Farrell – are working in Ireland. It is unclear whether Lancaster would fancy another crack but it seems highly unlikely Farrell could be appointed in advance of Ireland’s World Cup campaign in France. It is also worth noting that Graham Rowntree and Mike Catt are also employed in Ireland, ensuring the four coaches given long-term contract renewals in the buildup to the 2015 World Cup are all now contributing to the re-emergence of one of England’s closest rivals. If anything, those contracts and the subsequent home World Cup debacle should demonstrate to Sweeney and O’Shea that much can change in a short period of time. Indeed, O’Shea acknowledged as much last week which raises the question as to why the RFU’s criteria is already narrow enough to rule a wealth of strong contenders out. There were the usual caveats and nothing is set in stone but it seems an odd policy to now trumpet a war room when the battle plan has changed so often over the past six years.

3/29/2022,"The chief executive of LV= has come under renewed pressure to quit the mutual insurer after taking a £511,000 bonus despite his role in the botched sale of the 197-year-old company to a US private equity firm. Mark Hartigan, who faced stiff personal criticism for his role in the aborted sale to Bain Capital, was awarded the annual bonus after the board decided he met most of his personal targets for last year. The insurer founded as Liverpool Victoria in 1843 said on Tuesday that profits fell by £9m to £31m last year, despite an increase in the value of its new business sales from £1.3bn to £1.6bn. Hartigan had argued LV= could not continue as an independent insurer after a strategic review and pushed for a sale to Bain Capital over a potential deal with fellow mutual insurer Royal London, prompting the ire of critics who said it was bad for the company’s members and diversity of business ownership in the UK economy. Gareth Thomas, the Labour MP who chairs the all party parliamentary group for mutuals, said it was extraordinary the company could award Hartigan a big bonus after pursuing an unpopular, costly sale process. “This shocking bonus payment begs the question as to who is really in charge at LV. What on Earth were the board thinking?” Thomas said. “After his plan to demutualise and sell up to the controversial American private equity giant Bain Capital wasn’t backed by almost 90% of LV’s owners, it is extraordinary that the board can think such a payout for poor performance is justified. Mr Hartigan needs to leave and be replaced by someone who is genuinely committed to running a mutual business properly.” Company accounts show LV= spent at least £33m over the past two years on the strategic review and plan to sell to Bain Capital, before its members refused to back the deal in December. The firm said Hartigan had not been incentivised to pursue the sale, meaning the outcome of the process would not influence his bonus. It said the chief executive had met sufficient financial targets to be awarded 69% of a potential maximum bonus for the year, while 60% of the award would be deferred over the next three years. His total salary and bonus for the year was worth a combined £1.1m. Last month the company launched a boardroom clearout after the failed Bain Capital process, announcing that the chairman, Alan Cook, would step down from the start of April, while three other directors would also leave. However, it said Hartigan would remain with the firm and had been doing an excellent job. A spokesperson for LV= said Hartigan’s bonus was subject to “stretching individual and business performance outcomes” and set by the company’s board. “Mark has led the successful turnaround of the business over the last 18 months strengthening the commercial performance and improving the sustainability of the business. We have outperformed both our new business volumes and profitability targets with significant growth in sales and trading profit.”",News/Business,"LV= chief under pressure to quit over £511,000 bonus despite botched sale ",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/29/lv-chief-bonus-sale-mark-hartigan-bain-capital
3/29/2022,"Welcome to Pushing Buttons, the Guardian’s gaming newsletter. If you’d like to receive it in your inbox every week, just pop your email in below – and check your inbox (and spam) for the confirmation email. After an insanely busy few months in video games, things are finally starting to quiet down. April’s release list looks positively barren compared to February and March, and even the Wordle mania appears to be fading a bit. And for once there’s no pressing news for me to write about, so this is the ideal time to hand the metaphorical mic over to you. The thing that Pushing Buttons readers ask for most often is more game recommendations, and I get emails every week from people keen to share what they’re enjoying at the moment, or telling me about a game that the newsletter reminded them of. So this week, we’re doing a reader recommendations special, from games about love to games to fit in around a busy life. Thank you to everyone who’s written in over the past few months – the Pushing Buttons inbox is always full of great stuff, and I love reading it. --- “As a parent of toddler twins working a full-time job, I can certainly empathise with gaming being the last thing to ever get attention, but chip away we must. I’ve managed a few sessions on the aquarium-sim Abzu whilst the kids watch the fishes swim by, and occasional bouts on Cat Quest masquerading as Daddy day care.” – Alex Frascina “I played Journey only 2 years ago after a recommendation from a friend of the spouse. ‘Two hours to yourself and a good set of headphones – you’ll love it,’ the friend said. Love it? It was amazing, I have never played a game like it and left with an emotional attachment that I just can’t shake off. Even my 5 year old daughter has completed the game; she loves it for completely different reasons.” – Jamie Harman “I’m so glad you mentioned This War of Mine. Never has a game had such a profound effect on me. When it originally came out, I kept waking up in the middle of the night wondering what I could do to stop my characters falling into despair and depression. I felt totally responsible for them. In the end, I had to go cold turkey to stop myself obsessing about it. What is particularly sophisticated about the game is the way it doesn’t give you any instructions, which parallels with civilian experience of war itself. You have to just muddle through and there are no easy answers to ethical questions: is it justifiable to rob an elderly couple in order to stop your children starving? As a way of engendering empathy, it is incredibly poignant. Did you know that it is used in Polish schools as a way of social and ethical education? I would love it to be used in our education system, particularly as an antidote to games like Call of Duty that many children play.” – Emily “Haven is a game about love. Now, I am long past being a teenager (understatement) but I think there is a charm about this game and it drew me in. It’s a story about two young lovers escaping to a new planet, from a world where all marriages are arranged. The graphical/art style and storytelling is refreshing. Well worth a try for a young or old romantic, or someone just wanting a bit of relief from finding a better gun to shoot things with.” – Denny “I am still heartbroken after playing Old Man’s Journey – a simple yet addictive mobile puzzle game on the surface, but with an underlying message about lost love, living with regrets, and grief. I’m still not over it! The soundtrack by scntfc is also spectacular.” – Lynsey Graham “SpiritFarer is a wonderfully beautiful and simple, elegant and gently addictive journey through love and grief. It brought me to tears several times and made me give my other half a fierce hug because I had an urge to make sure that they knew how much I loved them.” – Andy “Firewatch is one of the best games I have ever played about love. Your relationship with Delilah can be so gloriously organic, from just professional to a friend or even a romantic interest, even though your interaction is never anything more than a conversation over a walkie talkie … Of course the real beauty of it I think was I think the ending, which was made a lot more impactful the more you put into that relationship. I recall reading steam reviews and angry forum posts from furious (presumably) younger players who I think perhaps hadn’t had as much experience in relationships – I think not getting what you want, even when you’ve chosen it and worked towards it, can be so much more memorable when done well.” – Thomas “As an old (72) gamer, I find many games simply too demanding of my age-degraded abilities. I also find it impossible to find anyone my age to team up with in multi-player games. I played 7 Days To Die for more than a year with the zombies turned off. It was engaging and fun and I also picked up enough skills and confidence that I could play it with zombies on … Then DayZ came to the PS4. Watching gameplay on YouTube, I was intrigued by its one simple demand: stay alive. With great trepidation, I gave it a go. It is difficult, true, but I wisely played on empty community servers, so I could learn the basics, unmolested by psychopathic kill-on-sight players. I was very fortunate to find a welcoming, start-up server, THEFORGOTTEN, run by a friendly, middle-aged Mancunian named Dave. He walked me through the game, patiently teaching me the ins and outs of its mechanics, emphasising its fun and accepting its absurdities. I’ve come around to his POV: DayZ is a brilliant game. Plus, stealth is essential and I’m much better at sneaking around than confronting zombies.” – Barrie Abbott I was tremendously sad to hear of the passing of 32-year-old Indonesian game developer Mohammad Fahmi this week. I’m going to recommend the first game he conceived and wrote, Coffee Talk, a thoughtful and unusual collection of slice-of-life stories set in late-night coffee shop in a fantasy Seattle. Your customers – humans, elves, werewolves – turn up, order drinks and vent about their troubles, and you provide a listening ear and a hot beverage. The interpersonal (and intercreatural?) drama in this game feels believable and intimate, and there’s something about the quiet work of making drinks for fantasy beings with piercings and interesting hair that encouraged me to slow down and relax. Thanks, Fahmi, for bringing this game into the world. Available on: PC, Mac, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, PS4Approximate playtime: 5 hours Sony is about to unveil a new game subscription service, according to post-Game Developers Conference rumours, and also Bloomberg and Video Games Chronicle. It is likely to consolidate PlayStation Plus, the online service that gives you monthly free games, and PlayStation Now, the cloud-streaming thing that gives you access to loads of Sony’s classic games for a monthly fee. Will it compete with Game Pass, the absurdly generous game subscription that Microsoft has been throwing money at for the last few years? The PlayStation back catalogue is Sony’s ace in the hole here, if you ask me. Speaking of streaming services, Netflix has just bought another game studio, Boss Fight Entertainment. That’s its third acquisition in the past six months, showing that the TV giant is ramping up its interest in interactive entertainment. “We’re still in the early days of building great game experiences as part of your Netflix subscription,” says Netflix’s Amir Rahmi in the press release. The future of games could legitimately be Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo and Netflix. I reckon it has a better chance than Google or Amazon, both of which have made expensive and ultimately unsuccessful attempts at getting a piece of the games industry in recent years. Pity the poor guy who owns the @willsmith Twitter account this week – he’s a video game comms worker and tech podcaster who did not slap anyone at an awards show recently. In The Atlantic, postgraduade student Luke Ivan Jukić writes about the new(ish) phenomenon of university students who’ve learned most of what they know about history from strategy games such as Paradox’s Europa Universalis. It’s a long read but an interesting one, a critical look at the limitations Paradox’s approach to history in its games, in which things like slavery or the Holocaust are often passed over. Nonetheless, most of the academics quoted in this article agree that games are a more interesting and, increasingly, more popular road into history than moves or TV.

Please can you advise me on which device I should get?” I think there’s only one right answer here: the Nintendo Switch. It’s a console that you can play both at home on the TV, or our and about (or in bed) on its built-in screen; it’s easy to use; and it has a huge and varied catalogue of games, from 2-hour story games to puzzle classics to epic adventures such as Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Practically every interesting indie game of the past 10 years is available on the Switch, and Nintendo’s own games – like Mario Odyssey, Animal Crossing and spooky comedic adventure Luigi’s Mansion – are universally high-quality, welcoming, and entertaining. Your other option is a PlayStation 4: it’s nearly ten years old now, but that means it’s cheaper, and has hundreds of games to choose from.

3/29/2022,"Donald Trump has claimed to have hit a hole-in-one at his golf course in Florida while playing with a former world No1, Ernie Els. The former president released a lengthy statement about the shot, which was said to have happened on Saturday, late on Monday. Earlier, a federal judge said Trump likely committed felonies during his attempts to overturn his election defeat by Joe Biden. Also on Monday, the House January 6 committee recommended criminal contempt charges for two aides, Dan Scavino and Peter Navarro. If the hole-in-one statement that followed was meant to change the conversation, it was not Trump’s first such gambit. It was however marginally less dramatic than his move last week, when a prosecutor who resigned from an investigation of Trump’s business affairs said he believed the former president committed “numerous” felonies. Trump followed that with a 108-page lawsuit alleging a vast conspiracy to delegitimise his presidency, led by Hillary Clinton. In his Monday statement, Trump said: “Many people are asking, so I’ll give it to you now, it is 100% true. While playing with the legendary golfer, Ernie Els, winner of four majors and approximately 72 other tournaments throughout the world, Gene Sauers, winner of the Senior US Open, Ken Duke and Mike Goodes, both excellent tour players, I made a hole-in-one.” Trump said he scored his hole-in-one on the par-three 7th at Trump International, West Palm Beach. He said there was both a “slight wind” and a “rather strong wind”, as he hit a five iron. The ball, he said, “bounced twice and then went clank, into the hole. “These great tour players noticed it before I did because their eyes are slightly better, but on that one hole only, their swings weren’t.” A video accompanied the statement. It showed Trump picking a ball out of the hole, but not the shot he said put it there. Referring to Trump’s status as the 45th president, Els tweeted: “Great shot on Saturday 45! Fun to watch the ball roll in for a hole-in-one.” It has been widely reported that Trump cheats at golf. In 2019, the golf writer Rick Reilly published a book, Commander in Cheat: How Golf Explains Trump. As well as reporting routine rule violations, with sources including the PGA Tour pro Brad Faxon and the actor Samuel L Jackson, Reilly wrote about Trump’s habit of claiming dubious feats. “Donald’s Trump’s boast about winning 18 club championships,” Reilly wrote, “is a lie that’s so over-the-top Crazytown it loses all credibility among golfers the second it’s out of his mouth.” Reilly also wrote that Trump International in West Palm Beach, Florida, now the site of Trump’s claimed hole-in-one, “has a plaque on the wall that lists all the men who’ve won the men’s club championship. Trump appears three times: 1999, 2001, and 2009. But hold on. The course wasn’t even open in 1999.” Reilly also examined Trump’s claim to have a handicap of 2.8. The man generally considered the greatest golfer of all time, Jack Nicklaus, plays off 3.4. In Reilly’s words: “If Trump is a 2.8, Queen Elizabeth is a pole vaulter.” On Monday, Trump’s hole-in-one claim met with widespread incredulity – and plenty of comparisons to the famous tale of Kim Jong-il, a North Korean dictator who claimed to have hit 11 holes-in-one in his first ever round. Responding to Trump’s statement, the Washington Post reporter Philip Bump spoke for many. “After nearly seven years in the public eye,” Bump wrote, “Donald Trump has somehow managed to out-Donald-Trump himself.”",News/US news,"‘Clank, into the hole’: Trump claims hole-in-one at Florida golf club ",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/29/trump-claims-hole-in-one-florida-golf-club
3/29/2022,"Liberal senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells has launched an extraordinary attack on the prime minister, Scott Morrison, in parliament, labelling him an “autocrat [and] a bully who has no moral compass”. The senator – who has recently been relegated to an unwinnable spot on the Liberal party’s NSW Senate ticket – used a late-night speech in the upper house on Tuesday to accuse the prime minister of destroying the Liberal party. Fierravanti-Wells told the Senate that Morrison was “not fit to be prime minister” and claimed he had “destroyed the Liberal party” through recent interventions in NSW branch preselections.

Morrison tops the list followed closely by Hawke,” she said. “Morrison is not interested in rules-based order. It is his way or the highway. An autocrat, a bully who has no moral compass.” Fierravanti-Wells earlier this week accused the party of having its own “mean girl” culture and spoke about “the stress associated with factional warfare”. On Tuesday night, just hours after the federal budget was handed down, the senator gave a short speech in the upper house during which she stated: “There is a very appropriate saying here – the fish stinks from the head.” Fierravanti-Wells said Morrison and Hawke had ruined the Liberal party in NSW by trampling its constitution.

She claimed the process had led to “captain’s picks” which party members opposed. “I have received hundreds if not thousands of emails outlining their disgust. They have lost faith in the party. They want to leave,” Fierravanti-Wells said in the Senate. “They don’t like Morrison and they don’t trust him. They continue to despair at our prospects at the next federal election. And they blame Morrison for this. Our members do not want to help in the upcoming election. Morrison is not fit to be prime minister. And Hawke certainly is not fit to be a minister.” Comment was sought from Morrison.

3/29/2022,"Iwas never ideologically opposed to smartphones. Or, at least, I wasn’t at first. It all began one spring afternoon in 2006, when a group of friends and I were mugged. The assailant demanded our phones and wallets but when I handed him my Nokia 1110, whose keypad was strapped to it with an elastic band, the mugger’s response was categorical: “Nah, mate.” It was humiliating. While my friends could bask in universal sympathy – they had, after all, lost their beloved and expensive BlackBerrys – I had to tell the rest of our school and the police that my phone was so crap it had been rejected. Even as a trophy. But there was another way of looking at it. My Nokia had been through a lot. Dropped so much its case had smashed (for a while, when I lost the keypad, I even texted using the end of a blunt pencil), it had now survived a robbery. A more glamorous device would have crumbled under the pressure, but my phone was made of sterner, simpler stuff. In some ways, its crapness was its biggest asset. When I thought about it like that, I wasn’t ashamed of my phone; I was proud. And when I lost it in my second year of university, I decided I wouldn’t upgrade. It was 2011, my friends were buying iPhones, but I stayed low-tech. For the next 10 years, I didn’t look back. Now it seems more and more people are recognising the virtues of keeping it simple: just last week the BBC was heralding “the return of ‘dumbphones’”. Functionality was never a problem. Dumbphones can call and text and, if you have a computer, that’s really all you need. The biggest problem is the way others regard you. There are plenty names for people like me – refusers, anti-technologists, neo-luddites – and most of them are negative, defined in some way by saying no. True, I wasn’t saying “yes” to a smartphone, but then I didn’t exactly have Apple executives banging on my door offering me an iPhone. My resistance, if it could be called that, was pretty passive. Besides, I was hardly living in a cabin in the woods. I had already succumbed to Facebook, I used Gmail. I still had a device in my pocket that was capable of converting a message into radio waves that travelled at the speed of light – even if, in predictive text, “food” always came out as “done”. The more smartphones took over, however, the more my resistance hardened into something more principled. Like anyone outside the mainstream I was forced to construct a rationale for my modus vivendi, not least to justify it to my friends, who had grown tired of sending me tailored invites to events because I wasn’t on any WhatsApp groups. I would opine that smartphones aren’t really about making our lives easier; they’re about allowing private companies to profit from areas of our lives that were previously closed to them. It might be quicker to order a cab through an app than to find the number of a local service, but in exchange for that efficiency you allow a company to log and sell your data. They make millions from this and what do you save? Seconds. And what precious time you gain you’re likely to squander scrolling through content anyway. I would even argue that smartphones can make people worse at performing everyday tasks. Basic orienteering skills and transport knowledge have been outsourced to apps like Google Maps, leaving us lost and confused the moment those services fail. If my friends called me a hypocrite, I would reply, haughtily, that my poor sense of direction was entirely God-given. In short, in order to defend myself, I became an “ideologist”, someone whose “rejection stems from a formulated, critical worldview towards the mobile phone”. When I met another dumbphone user, I felt an instant affinity. We would swap techniques for navigating the world – how, before we flew to foreign cities, we had to print out maps to take us from the station to our hotels. We would bemoan how hard old-school texting can be on thumbs, and how most of the time we just called, which our friends found alarming. But in August last year, I lost my footing on a sheep track and tumbled 15 feet into a ravine. Dumbphones are strong, but even they have their kryptonite. When my Nokia felt the kiss of that Scottish stream, it gave up the ghost after a decade of loyal service. At the start of the pandemic, my mother had sent me her old iPhone 5s in the hope that the isolation of lockdown might finally convince me to join the family WhatsApp group. At first I had politely declined, but I knew if I bought another Nokia now she would never forgive me. I would say it’s made my life easier, but in complicated ways. I no longer have to carry my laptop with me, ducking into coffee shops to check my work email. But then my 5s is not much better than a Nokia. It can’t support iOS 14, which means that most apps are beyond it. And for some mysterious reason it will only send and receive messages, even via SMS, when it’s connected to wifi. And when I turn on mobile data, it promptly switches off. In some ways, it’s a good compromise. I can still feel like a survivalist, finding new ways around my phone’s shortcomings, while also being able to receive images of my brother’s new baby. So long as I’m near a wireless router, that is. But such is built-in obsolescence, pretty soon I’ll have to get a new phone. If I decide to stay with a smartphone, it’ll have to be second-hand and at least a little bit crap. Because if there was joy in using an old Nokia for a decade, it never came from shunning the mainstream. It was about saying yes to something that others rejected. Something only the most discerning mugger could love. Max Fletcher is writer based in London. ",Opinion/Opinion,Even a mugger didn’t want my old Nokia. So why are so many people turning to ‘dumbphones’? | Max Fletcher,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/29/mugger-nokia-dumbphones
