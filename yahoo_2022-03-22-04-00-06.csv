3/22/2022,"Aviation experts are baffled by data showing that a China Eastern Boeing 737-800 about to begin its descent to the city of Guangzhou suddenly plunged vertically to earth like a missile, killing the 123 passengers and nine crew aboard on Monday. This horrific disaster, the worst in recent Chinese aviation history, highlights that the kind of data that once took investigators at least days to gather is now instantly available from open source tracking sites like FlightRadar. As a result, speculation about the cause of a crash creates an instant Twitter storm as pilots and technical experts attempt to interpret what they are looking at. Boeing 737 Was Plunging at 350MPH in Moments Before Crash in China with 132 Aboard In this case, there is a striking consensus that something very unusual happened that cannot directly relate to previous disasters involving this version of the 737, one of the most flown jets in the world, which preceded the 737-MAX version that was grounded for nearly two years after two catastrophic accidents. The flight pattern revealed by radar shows that the airplane was flying at 29,100 feet over mountainous terrain, with the crew about to prepare for the descent, when the nose abruptly pitched down and it began the dive. As it neared the terrain it seemed to briefly pull up but then resumed the dive to impact with enormous force. The only certain details are what did not happen: there was no indication of an engine fire and no sign of any major part of the airplane breaking up. Significantly, there was no time for the crew to send a Mayday distress call. There have been several cases of various models of the 737 suffering an explosive decompression, when part of the fuselage structure, weakened by undetected cracks in the outer skin, suddenly rips open and the air in the pressurized cabin is released in a blast, but even with that damage pilots have been able to get the airplane down safely, even with parts of the cabin open to the skies. But those events happened early in the flights, when the airplanes were reaching cruise altitude, not as in this case at the end of the cruise and at the beginning of the approach to the airport. One aerospace engineer, commenting on the Aviation Herald site, says, “It is not normal for a plane to nose dive into the ground, it rules out a lot of failures.” Another says, “To those who can’t think of any reason… there are a lot. Some repeats from things that already happened, perhaps something that has never happened before. Aviation is like that.” The Machiavellian Reason China Is Putting the Squeeze on Boeing There was a case where a similar dive was involved: in 1997 Silk Air Flight 185, when an earlier model 737 crashed into a river in Sumatra, killing 104 people, where an investigation by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the pilot had deliberately triggered the dive in an act of suicide, but this verdict was disputed by Indonesian regulators, who cited problems with the rudder controls that had caused other crashes of that model. Another possibility is that although no break-up was visible on the radar track some part of the horizontal stabilizer, which would be activated to begin descent, may have broken off. All of this leads to one urgent task—to find an answer in the one place where it should be found, in the airplane’s black boxes. The crash site is accessible and teams are headed there. There is, however, some concern that these flight data recorders might not survive such a devastating impact. The Chinese regulators and investigators are highly regarded. China was the first country to ground the 737-Max and the last to allow it to return to the skies. Domestic air travel in China has grown rapidly in the last decade but there have been very few accidents. Read more at The Daily Beast.

3/22/2022,"STORY: Hours after Russia's attack on Ukraine began, five German warships set sail for Latvia to help protect the most vulnerable part of NATO's eastern flank. Russia's invasion has propelled the alliance into what Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has called a ""new normal"". It looks a lot like the past. NATO was founded in 1949 to defend against the Soviet threat. Now, a new Iron Curtain could fall across Europe. NATO needs to ensure its members are not behind it if it does. NATO has expanded eastwards since the 1990s, bringing in former Soviet states such as Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia - where these French troops disembarked last week. A single overland corridor connects them to the rest of NATO territory, and it is squeezed between the heavily armed Russian enclave of Kaliningrad and Moscow ally Belarus. An emboldened Russia could encircle them and cut them off from the alliance. That's where the Latvian mission comes in – a regular mine-clearing exercise that was brought forward by Russia's invasion. One goal is to keep the waterway open, the other is a show of strength. This was German naval commander Terje Schmitt-Eliassen, on board the 'Elbe' in Riga's harbor: ""We will be 12 units from six countries, and we are essentially showing our presence in the eastern Baltic."" Direct confrontation between NATO and Russia could touch off a global conflict. One retired NATO commander told Reuters the alliance is considering whether deterrence is enough. Not according to Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis last week. ""We are convinced in the Baltic states that we need to move from deterrence to a standing defence and it has to come from NATO planning leadership, that they will start looking into the region differently than they had throughout the last two decades."" Since the invasion, NATO allies have also moved five aircraft carriers into European waters, increased the number of warplanes in NATO airspace and more than doubled the size of combat units in the Baltics and Poland. NATO also faces a return to mechanized warfare and a huge increase in defense spending.",Politics/Reuters Videos,"Russia may not stop with Ukraine, NATO fears",https://news.yahoo.com/russia-may-not-stop-ukraine-172729515.html
3/22/2022,"By Martin Quin Pollard GUANGZHOU, China (Reuters) - A China Eastern Airlines Boeing 737-800 with 132 people on board crashed in mountains in southern China on a domestic flight on Monday after a sudden descent from cruising altitude. Media said there were no signs of survivors. The airline said it deeply mourned the passengers and crew, without specifying how many people had been killed. Boeing said it was ready to assist China Eastern and was in contact with U.S. transportation safety regulators over the incident. Chinese media carried brief highway video footage from a vehicle's dashcam apparently showing a jet diving to the ground behind trees at an angle of about 35 degrees off vertical. Reuters could not immediately verify the footage. The plane was en route from the southwestern city of Kunming, capital of Yunnan province, to Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong, bordering Hong Kong, when it crashed. China Eastern said the cause of the crash, in which the plane descended at 31,000 feet a minute according to flight tracking website FlightRadar24, was under investigation. The airline said it had provided a hotline for relatives of those on board and sent a working group to the site. There were no foreigners on the flight, Chinese state television reported, citing China Eastern. Relatives, friends and colleagues of passengers gathered late on Monday in a cordoned off area at the jet's destination, Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport. One man surnamed Yan said that a colleague had been on the plane, and that he had notified the 29-year-old's mother. ""When she picked up the phone, she choked up,"" said Yan, adding that he had a ""heavy heart"" when he heard the news. China Eastern staff were making arrangements for relatives who wished to travel to the crash site on Tuesday, Yan said. Reuters was not able to independently verify Yan's identity. The aircraft, with 123 passengers and nine crew on board, lost contact over the city of Wuzhou, China's Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) and the airline said. The flight left Kunming at 1:11 p.m. (0511 GMT), FlightRadar24 data showed, and had been due to land in Guangzhou at 3:05 p.m. (0705 GMT). The plane, which Flightradar24 said was six years old, had been cruising at 29,100 feet at 0620 GMT. Just over two minutes and 15 seconds later, data showed it had descended to 9,075 feet. Twenty seconds later, its last tracked altitude was 3,225 feet. Media cited a rescue official as saying the plane had disintegrated and caused a fire destroying bamboo trees. The People's Daily quoted a provincial firefighting department official as saying there was no sign of life among the debris. State media showed a piece of the plane on a scarred, earthen hillside. There was no sign of a fire or personal belongings. CRUISE PHASE Crashes during the cruise phase of flights are relatively rare, even though this period accounts for the majority of flight time. Boeing said last year only 13% of fatal commercial accidents globally between 2011 and 2020 occurred during the cruise phase, whereas 28% occurred on final approach and 26% on landing. ""Usually the plane is on auto-pilot during cruise stage. So it is very hard to fathom what happened,"" said Li Xiaojin, a Chinese aviation expert. Online weather data showed partly cloudy conditions with good visibility in Wuzhou at the time of the crash. President Xi Jinping called for investigators to determine the cause of the crash as soon as possible, state broadcaster CCTV reported. Boeing said in a statement that its thoughts were with the passengers and crew. ""Boeing is in contact with the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and our technical experts are prepared to assist with the investigation led by the Civil Aviation Administration of China,"" the company said. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters that Boeing has canceled a meeting of its senior executives scheduled for this week in Miami to focus on assisting the investigation and China Eastern Airlines. Shares in Boeing were down 4% at 19:15 GMT. Shares in China Eastern Airlines in Hong Kong closed down 6.5% after news of the crash emerged, while its U.S.-listed shares slumped 17% in premarket trading. China Eastern grounded its fleet of 737-800 planes after the crash, state media reported. China Eastern has 109 of the aircraft in its fleet, according to FlightRadar24. 'GOOD RECORD' Aviation data provider OAG said this month that state-owned China Eastern Airlines was the world's sixth-largest carrier by scheduled weekly seat capacity. The 737-800 has a good safety record and is the predecessor to the 737 MAX model that has been grounded in China for more than three years after fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. China's airline safety record has been among the best in the world for a decade. ""The CAAC has very rigid safety regulations and we will just need to wait for more details,"" said Shukor Yusof, head of Malaysia-based aviation consultancy Endau Analytics. ​ Investigators will search for the plane's black boxes - the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder - to shed light on the crash. Air crash investigations are typically led by the country of the accident and include participation by the plane's country of origin, so U.S. investigators would be expected to join the probe of the U.S.-made Boeing jet. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said it was ready to assist with China's investigation if asked. China's aviation safety record, while good, is less transparent than in countries like the U.S. and Australia where regulators release detailed reports on non-fatal incidents, said Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor at industry publication Flightglobal. ""There have been concerns that there is some underreporting of safety lapses on the mainland,"" he said. According to Aviation Safety Network, China's last fatal jet accident was in 2010, when 44 of 96 people on board were killed when an Embraer E-190 regional jet flown by Henan Airlines crashed on approach to Yichun airport. In 1994 a China Northwest Airlines Tupolev Tu-154 flying from Xian to Guangzhou crashed, killing all 160 on board in China's worst-ever air disaster, according to Aviation Safety Network.

3/22/2022,"Russia’s military has claimed to have twice unleashed hypersonic missiles in its invasion of Ukraine, apparently destroying an arms depot in the process, during its monthlong onslaught. On Saturday, the Russian Ministry of Defense claimed it had struck an underground missile and ammunition warehouse in a village that borders Romania, and on Sunday, that it had destroyed a fuel depot near the southern city of Mykolaiv. Defense Ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov claimed the attack used its newest Kinzhal, or “dagger,” hypersonic missile, in Ukraine. “The Kinzhal aviation missile system with hypersonic aeroballistic missiles destroyed a large underground warehouse containing missiles and aviation ammunition in the village of Deliatyn in the Ivano-Frankivsk region,” Konashenkov claimed. RIA Novosti, a Russian state news agency, said the attacks were the first time the next-generation weapons have been used since Russian troops were deployed to Ukraine on Feb. 24. However, on March 9, Ukraine’s National Guard shared a picture of an unexploded hypersonic missile in the city of Kramatorsk in the breakaway region of Donetsk. Reports did not verify whether it was a “dagger” missile. The advanced missile, which Russian President Vladimir Putin previously described as an “ideal weapon,” was one of several new weapons he unveiled in his state of the nation address in 2018. During that speech, Putin boasted that the missiles could hit almost any point across the world and evade the United States’ missile defense shield. It is believed that Russia first used the hypersonic weapon in support of Bashar Assad during the Syrian civil war in 2016, although it has not been confirmed if it was the exact Kinzhal model. The missile, designed to be launched from a MiG fighter jet, can fly at 10 times the speed of sound, and unlike other missiles can change course during its flight, making it impossible for air-defense systems to shoot it down. The Kinzhal missile can also be used to deliver nuclear weapons. In comparison, while the U.S. Tomahawk cruise missile can travel as fast as 550 mph, the Kinzhal can travel at 7,672 mph. The French Navy and the U.K.'s Royal Navy have since 2011 been jointly developing their own hypersonic missile, which is expected to be completed in 2030. Ukrainian officials have confirmed Russia’s attacks over the weekend but said the type of missile used was not confirmed. According to reports, doubts have swirled over Russia’s use of the ballistic missile. One report suggested that the lack of secondary explosions from the attack at an ammunition warehouse in western Ukraine is suspicious. “There’s also a distinct lack of secondary explosions as one would expect when rocket fuel and explosives cook-off,” the online magazine the War Zone noted on Saturday. The magazine also questioned how an Orlan-10 — an unmanned aerial vehicle, commonly known as a drone — was able to fly over the targeted area to film the strike. If a maneuverable hypersonic missile was needed for the attack due to Ukraine’s air-defense systems, then how could a drone manage to film the strike and get away safely? Russian analyst Pavel Felgenhauer said the missile would change little on the ground in Ukraine beyond “giving a certain psychological and propaganda effect.” He added that its use may suggest that the Russian military’s weapons are drying up. Defense strategy researcher Joseph Henrotin reiterated Felgenhauer’s point, suggesting on Twitter that Russia could be running out of weaponry. Henrotin also claimed that Putin might have used the nuclear-capable missile in a bid to raise the stakes of the war. On Saturday, the U.N.’s human rights office said at least 847 civilians had been killed since Feb. 24, including 155 men, 119 women, 21 boys and seven girls, but said it’s believed the actual figures are “considerably higher.” _____ _____",World/Yahoo News,What are hypersonic missiles?

3/22/2022,"In Washington on Monday, the Texas senator Ted Cruz complained that supreme court confirmation hearings have become increasingly angry and confrontational. Related: US supreme court justice Clarence Thomas in hospital with infection In Bozeman, Montana the previous day, however, the Republican was filmed becoming angry and confrontational with airport staff and an armed police officer. A short video, appearing to have been shot from behind a check-in desk, was posted to Reddit. It showed the masked senator remonstrating with the two staff members, both women, and the male officer. It was not possible to hear what was said. A caption said: “Ted Cruz accosting airline employees today at BZN after missing his flight. Law enforcement had to be called when he wouldn’t calm down.” An airport official told the Daily Mail the senator missed his check-in window for a flight and became “frustrated” as other options were limited due to spring break traffic. “One of our public safety officers was in the ticket lobby and was asked to assist with a frustrated passenger at the United ticket counter (which is not unusual),” said Scott Humphrey, the Bozeman airport deputy director. “Once travel options were explained to the passenger, he was rebooked and departed Bozeman later that evening. Our [officer] didn’t realise he was dealing with Senator Cruz until after the fact.” Cruz made it to Washington for the opening on Monday of hearings for Ketanji Brown Jackson, Joe Biden’s first supreme court nominee. The senator did not immediately comment about his experience at Bozeman airport. Critics online did. Rick Wilson, a former Republican operative and co-founder of the anti-Trump Lincoln Project, said: “Ted Cruz getting aggro with airline counter folks is so very on-brand. ‘Well, sir, if you don’t like your flight options, we can drive you to the train station.’” Keith Olbermann, a writer and TV host, said: “So Ted Cruz was apparently so out-of-control abusive to airline staff at the airport in Bozeman, Montana, that law enforcement had to get involved. It must’ve been snowing.” That was a reference to events in Texas and Mexico last year, when Cruz left his state during a lethal big freeze to fly out for a family break in Cancun. Amid controversy, Cruz admitted his mistake and flew home. Online, some altered Donald Trump’s old nickname for his rival, Lyin’ Ted, to call the senator Flyin’ Ted instead. Responding to coverage of his Cancun escapade, Cruz said: “Here’s a suggestion. Just don’t be assholes.

3/22/2022,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's finance minister has called for fresh talks over a free trade agreement between the European Union and the United States, a newspaper reported on Sunday, aiming to revive discussions halted by former U.S. President Donald Trump.

""We should resume negotiations on a transatlantic free trade agreement. Especially now in the (Ukraine) crisis, it is becoming clear how important free trade is with partners around the world who share our values,"" Christian Lindner, the finance minister of Europe's largest economy, told Handelsblatt.

3/22/2022,"How much does a molecule weigh? Well, that depends. Molecules, like people, come in various shapes and sizes. That difference in size can mean a lot for researchers in the ever-evolving pharmaceutical industry. Molecular weight is a key component to manufacturing — it can actually be used to determine how effective a pharmaceutical drug is. ""Probably the single most important piece of information that you can get (from a mass) is its molecular weight — How big is it? How heavy is it? Mass spectrometry is a very accurate way of measuring the masses of molecules,"" distinguished IU professor Martin Jarrold said. Jarrold and fellow IU chemistry professor David Clemmer are the founders of Megadalton Solutions, a start-up company whose technology has made a big splash in the measurement field. Look inside: Monroe County's most expensive home sold in 2021 features lake view, lots of space These two Indiana University chemistry professors developed a new, refined method to test the effectiveness of experimental pharmaceuticals. Some of these drugs, coined the next-generation medicine, are projected to revolutionize the medical field. ""(The technology) just came along at the right time,"" Jarrold told the Herald-Times. Megadalton Solutions recently entered an exclusive licensing agreement with Waters Corporation, an analytical laboratory instrument and software company. Waters was recently recognized as one of America's largest companies of 2021 by Fortune Magazine. The technology, an IU-refined take on charge detection mass spectrometry (CDMS), will be used to test the potency of new pharmaceutical drugs in the rapidly evolving field of gene-based therapies. This new wave of medicine can potentially prevent or provide long-term treatment of certain genetic disorders. Mass spectrometry converts the molecule into an ion, which can then be weighed on an instrument. You might not recognize a mass spectrometer offhand, but you've definitely used one before if you've boarded a flight in the last 20 years. An airport's detector sensors are compact mass spectrometry instruments. These sensors are used as homeland security checks to identify illegal drugs or explosive compounds. However, since the first mass spectrometer was invented in 1912, the instrument has had limitations. For objects with a light molecular weight, such as antibodies, scientists have a tried and true method of measurement known as conventional mass spectrometry. But for determining the weight of large, heavy molecules, it has historically been less like reading a number off a scale and more like that age-old weight guessing game typically seen at a county fair. These specific drugs, such as those being developed for gene therapy, can weigh over a million mass units. ""Whereas conventional mass spectrometry played a role in the development of the small-molecule drugs, it ran into this sort of fundamental problem with being able to measure the masses of the heavier, larger molecules that are being developed as drugs now,"" Jarrold said. More IU news: Indiana University trustees violated open door law with Michael McRobbie payment approval For heavier molecules, scientists must use charge detection mass spectrometry. Jarrold and his team of collaborators have built a machine that can analyze large, complex molecules with an unprecedented level of accuracy and speed. According to Jarrold, the idea for the technology was borne out of a desire for kinship. When he first arrived at IU, Jarrold felt like an outsider. While his colleagues were discussing their work with viruses, his background was rooted in mass spectrometry. ""I thought, 'Gosh, you know, wouldn't it be cool if we could start weighing viruses and I'd have all these collaborators that I could work with and feel as though I was a member, instead of somebody on the outside,'"" Jarrold recalled. This led him to a scientific discovery, aided by several colleagues and students throughout the years. According to Jarrold, he has spent close to a decade on the technology, tinkering in the IU chemistry building. The machine has been viable for five years now and Jarrold and others at IU continue to refine it for commercial use. IU’s Innovation and Commercialization Office made efforts to patent a lot of the technology that helped secure the corporate partnership. Dan McNerny, a technology commercialization manager in the office, has worked with Jarrold for several years on the business side. ""I did not need to be sold on it,"" McNerny said. Before his current position, McNerny was a researcher who had looked into manufacturing therapeutics, where something like Jarrold's technology would have made a big difference. ""Ultimately why my project failed is because we could never actually determine what was in the mixtures that we were creating. We would try to find how heavy it was and the result was you'd get a blob back,"" McNerny said. The technology can have various applications in the medical industry, such as analyzing vaccines or lipoproteins in cardiovascular diseases. ""There's a whole slew of these large objects, which have not previously been accessible to accurate mass measurements, that can now be analyzed,"" Jarrold said. ""The sort of drug that CDMS really is having an impact in the area is gene therapy, which is really sort of revolutionizing medicine at the moment."" Waters Corporation has indicated that Megadalton Solutions' technology will be further developed for use in gene therapies. Gene therapy is a new medical approach that can treat or even prevent certain diseases by correcting the underlying genetic problem, either through replacing a faulty gene or adding a new one. Gene therapy has the potential of being a new form of treatment for a wide range of diseases, such as cancer, cystic fibrosis, diabetes and AIDS. ""Many of these genetic diseases, which are like death sentences for people that have them, can now be fixed,"" Jarrold said. Currently, gene therapy can only treat monogenic disorders, which are caused by variation in a single gene. Some examples of monogenic disorders include sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis and Huntington's disease. ""In the future, you can anticipate that the multiple gene ones can also be fixed as time goes on,"" Jarrold said. Jarrold estimates that there are over 200 new gene- and cell-based therapy drugs currently in the development research pipeline. During development, pharmaceutical manufacturers must verify there are no errors in the final product. Empty capsules could reduce the drug's potency. In a worst case scenario, it could even lead to harmful mutated genes. That's why technology such as Jarrold's CDMS is crucial in these preliminary stages. Jarrold said he plans to continue working with Waters on the technology to improve its accuracy and performance. Once fully developed, the machines could appear in laboratories around the world. ""This could really lead to new and unexpected discoveries because nobody's measured the masses of these very large things with very high resolution,"" Jarrold said. ""That area itself is like a complete unknown as to what we might find there. There could be some very interesting science there.""
