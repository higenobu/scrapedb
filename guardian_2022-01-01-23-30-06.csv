1/1/2022,"A “very tough” few weeks will put the health service under such enormous pressure that hospital bosses could be forced to reintroduce a ban on visitors, a health chief has said. Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents NHS trusts in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, told BBC Breakfast on Saturday: “Hospital managers have to make very difficult choices and excluding visitors is one of those very difficult choices.  “It’s not something that anybody wants to do, it’s a last resort. But, when you’re facing the kind of pressures the health service is going to be under for the next few weeks, this is the kind of thing managers have to do. “I understand how much people want to return to normal and I’m confident that, as this year progresses, we will be able to do that, and we all hope that 2022 is the year in which coronavirus just becomes an illness that we live with, not an illness that dominates our lives. “But you can have the optimism but still recognise the next few weeks are going to be very tough and we need to do whatever is necessary to get us through these next few weeks.” Earlier this week, the Times reported that the government was also considering creating a rule that hospitals should not force women to give birth or attend scans without their partners present, even if tougher restrictions were deemed necessary to curb the spread of Omicron. The NHS effort to deal with Omicron is being hampered because substantial numbers of patients cannot be discharged from hospital despite being fit to return home, NHS leaders have said. NHS England figures show that 9,213 patients were forced to stay in hospital on Christmas Day because they could not be supported to go home. On Boxing Day, the number of patients in hospital for more than three weeks who were unable to leave had reached 4,124. Some care homes are not accepting patients because they do not have the staff to deal with them, according to Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers. Staff absences also mean that hospitals in England are unable to deal with some non-urgent treatments, such as physiotherapy and rehabilitation, which are vital for enabling patients to leave hospital. In some hospitals, up to a quarter of beds are filled by people who could otherwise be discharged, Hopson said. The NHS situation report, published on Friday, showed that medical staff had managed to help more than 10,000 people a day leave hospital in the run-up to Christmas. Staff absences due to Covid have more than doubled in the past month, from 11,375 on 29 November to 24,632 by Boxing Day. “We saw some progress in the run-up to Christmas in discharging patients who were medically fit to return home or other community settings,” Hopson said. “That reflected a lot of work to free up capacity to prepare for the threat from Omicron. But this remains a real problem and we know from talking to trust chief executives that in some hospitals delayed discharges can account for 20-25% of the bed base. “In the last 48 hours trust CEOs have been pointing to the fact that growing staff absences mean it’s getting harder to maintain NHS rehabilitation and step-down services, and there are similar problems in social care. “We’re also now hearing of some care homes being closed to new admissions because of staff absences, or Omicron outbreaks, or both.” The news comes as the health secretary, Sajid Javid, said further restrictions on freedom in England “must be an absolute last resort”, amid a record-breaking wave of infections due to the Omicron variant. The current wave will, however, “test the limits of finite NHS capacity even more than a typical winter”, Javid said, as hospital admissions in England climbed to their highest since last January. Writing in the Daily Mail, Javid said England had “welcomed in 2022 with some of the least restrictive measures in Europe”, after the government decided against ramping up protective rules – a move that put Downing Street at odds with leaders of the devolved countries, who had opted for restrictions on nightclubs, other hospitality venues and new year celebrations. “Curbs on our freedom must be an absolute last resort and the British people rightly expect us to do everything in our power to avert them,” Javid wrote. “Since I came into this role six months ago I’ve also been acutely conscious of the enormous health, social and economic costs of lockdowns. “So I’ve been determined that we must give ourselves the best chance of living alongside the virus and avoiding strict measures in the future.” Despite his optimism, the health secretary admitted the time lag between infections and hospital admissions meant it was “inevitable that we will still see a big increase” in the number of people with Covid needing treatment over the next month, and warned that the pandemic was “still far from over”.",News/World news,"Hospitals may have to reintroduce visitor bans, NHS chief says",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/01/hospitals-may-have-to-reintroduce-visitor-bans-health-chief-says
1/1/2022,"The number of UK households living in fuel poverty could climb to the highest level on record by this spring unless the government moves to soften the blow of a looming record high energy bill hike, according to a fuel poverty charity. Around 4 million homes in the UK were already classed as fuel poor before a surge in global energy market prices triggered one of the steepest ever energy bill hikes in October, but campaigners are braced for a record increase in the numbers unable to pay their energy bills following another hike this spring.  The charity National Energy Action warned that the double blow to household bills could cause at least 2 million more homes to slip into fuel poverty compared with the start of 2021, taking the total to 6 million households. This would be the highest level of fuel poverty across the UK since records began in 1996. The looming energy price hike has not yet been finalised by the regulator but Adam Scorer, chief executive of National Energy Action, told the Observer that the number of households in fuel poverty would “skyrocket” in April. This is expected to deepen the UK’s national energy crisis and compound the “year of the squeeze”, predicted by the Resolution Foundation last week, which threatens to trigger a “cost of living catastrophe” for hard-pressed families. Households are already paying record prices to put petrol in their cars, and can expect the cost of consumer goods to rocket as fuel prices and supply-chain disruptions take their toll on major companies. “Those on lowest incomes and in less-efficient homes will not just face financial hardship but intolerable living conditions, ill health and, for too many, a shortened life,” Scorer said. “This is not just conjecture. It will happen and we’ve had enough time to see it coming and act.” Energy market prices climbed steadily over 2021 before leaping to record highs in October and fresh record highs in December. The market rally has fuelled one of the steepest energy price hikes in the history of the UK’s liberalised energy market. Ed Miliband, shadow secretary of state for climate change and net zero, said: “Working people are being hit by a cost-of-living crisis which has seen energy bills soar, food costs increase and the weekly budget stretched. The government must take urgent action to support those people struggling to pay bills.” Senior officials from the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, the Treasury and No 10 have met with the industry regulator, Ofgem, and executives from the UK’s biggest energy suppliers in recent weeks to thrash out a plan to avert the looming national energy crisis. No measures have so far been agreed, and further meetings are scheduled for this week. The government’s energy price cap could allow the average energy bill to rocket further to almost £2,000 a year when it is reset in April, from £1,138 in the previous year, to help cover the cost of dozens of failed energy suppliers, according to industry experts. Labour has called for VAT on energy bills to be cut as a first step to help every household this winter, and the party would also “ramp up ambition with our plan to retrofit 19 million homes” to make them more energy efficient and help bring down household bills. “It is a moral and social scandal that fuel poverty exists in modern Britain. But with national leadership, we can beat it – and ensure everyone has the warm, secure home they deserve,” Miliband added. A government spokesperson said protecting consumers was its “top priority” which is why it was keeping in place the energy price cap, alongside schemes such as the £500m household support fund, the warm home discount, winter fuel payments for over-65s and cold weather payments.",News/Society,"6m UK homes may be unable to pay energy bills after price hike, charity warns",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/01/6m-homes-uk-pay-energy-bills-price-hike-fuel-poverty
