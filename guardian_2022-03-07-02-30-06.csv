3/7/2022,"Russia has been accused of trying to take the Iran nuclear deal hostage as part of its wider battle with the west over Ukraine, after it threw a last-minute spanner into plans for an agreement to lift a swathe of US economic sanctions on Tehran. After months of negotiations in Vienna, a revised deal was expected to be reached within days, under which US sanctions would be lifted in return for Tehran returning to full compliance with the 2015 nuclear non-proliferation deal. But diplomatic efforts have been sent into a tailspin by Russia’s unexpected demand for written guarantees that its economic trade with Iran will be exempted from US sanctions imposed on Russia since its invasion of Ukraine. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, at the weekend cited the “avalanche of aggressive sanctions [on Russia] that the west has started spewing out”, and said: “This meant Moscow had to ask the US for guarantees first, requiring a clear answer that the new sanctions will not affect its rights under the nuclear deal. “We requested that our US colleagues … give us written guarantees at the minimum level of the secretary of state that the current [sanctions] process launched by the US will not in any way harm our right to free, fully fledged trade and economic and investment cooperation and military-technical cooperation with Iran.” In a sign of how sanctions will bite, Aeroflot flights from Moscow to Iran were cancelled on Sunday. If Lavrov’s demand is to require the US to exempt Russian-Iranian trade from sanctions, the west is almost certain to reject the demand since it would open a huge loophole in the sanctions regime. It would then be up to Moscow whether to veto the nuclear deal altogether. US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, dismissed Russia’s demands as “irrelevant”, saying that sanctions imposed after the invasion of Ukraine “have nothing to do with the Iran nuclear deal.” They “just are not in any way linked together, so I think that’s irrelevant,” Blinken told CBS. The Vienna talks have for months been an oasis of diplomatic cooperation between Russia and the west as they painstakingly crafted a compromise acceptable to both Iran and the US. The Russian ambassador to the Vienna talks, Mikhail Ulyanov, has been an indefatigable intermediary, but now risks seeing his work being undone by Moscow’s confrontation with the west over Ukraine. Iranian officials criticised Russia’s intervention, saying “the Russians put this demand on the table at the Vienna talks two days ago. There is an understanding that by changing its position in [the] Vienna talks, Russia wants to secure its interests in other places. This move is not constructive for [the] Vienna nuclear talks”. Russia also has a short-term strategic interest in scuppering or postponing the deal. Iran produces more than 2m barrels of oil a day, and if these supplies were able to reach the markets, the upward surge in prices would be slowed. Russia, a large-scale oil producer, wants to drive the oil price up both to turn the screw on western economies, but also to boost its own budget revenues. Israel, a fierce opponent of a revived nuclear deal, will be the only major country privately welcoming Russia’s actions. The parties to the deal are Iran, the E3 (France, Germany and the UK), Russia and China. The US is present in Vienna, but Iran will not directly negotiate with the US delegation. Separately, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, was in Tehran this weekend trying to secure a deal on the future inspection regime. Grossi was hoping to resolve disagreements over the IAEA’s demand for access to four sites where suspicious nuclear activities were alleged to have taken place. Iran wants the IAEA to close down these investigations, claiming they are based on false Israeli intelligence. Mohammad Eslami, the head of the Iranian atomic energy association, has also sought assurances that what Iran regards as Israeli intelligence will not form the basis of future IAEA investigations into Iran. The two sides agreed to exchange documents by June, the likely date for the Iran deal to come back into force, but seemed to have left issues about the inspection regime unresolved. Meanwhile, the IAEA will continue with an inspection regime in which its surveillance cameras remain in place, and the memory cards of the cameras kept under joint seal.",News/World news,Iran nuclear talks rocked by Russian demand for sanctions exemption,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/06/iran-nuclear-talks-rocked-by-russian-demand-for-sanctions-exemption
3/7/2022,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says the US and its allies are engaged in a “very active discussion” about banning the import of Russian oil and natural gas in a new escalation of sanctions in retaliation for its invasion of Ukraine. The US and western allies have until now held off on current energy supplies from Russia, in order to avoid blowback on their own economies, where inflation is already making prices of gasoline and other goods a problem. Earlier this week, the White House publicly rebuffed suggestions from lawmakers that the US ban Russian oil, which made up 3% of all the crude shipments that arrived in the US last year, according to data from the US Energy Information Administration. But Europe is far more dependent, with an estimated 30% of oil and 39% of gas supplies coming from Russia. Blinken told CNN on Sunday morning that Joe Biden convened a meeting of his National Security Council on the subject the day before. “We are now talking to our European partners and allies to look in a coordinated way at the prospect of banning the import of Russian oil while making sure that there is still an appropriate supply of oil on world market,” said Blinken. “That’s a very active discussion as we speak.” Republicans and a growing number of Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, back the idea of a Russian oil import ban, arguing that Russia’s lucrative exports fund Putin’s war effort. “I’m all for that… ban the oil coming from Russia,” Pelosi said at her weekly press briefing on Capitol Hill on Thursday. But the White House has maintained that it doesn’t want to cause domestic fuel prices to rise. “We don’t have a strategic interest in reducing the global supply of energy,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki has said. Energy analysts have warned that there are limited options for maintaining oil supplies without Russian imports. OPEC Plus member countries, which include Russia, last week rejected increasing production , and global inventories of oil are low. Oil rose to $117 a barrel last week, the highest price since 2008. One option to maintain price stability, analysts have said, is to reduce demand – a process known to traders as “demand destruction.” On Sunday’s US TV talk shows, Florida senator Marco Rubio, a Republican, said he supported Biden’s resistance to issuing a Russian oil import ban so far. But he said the US could “phase that in pretty rapidly” using “reserves for the purposes of buffering that”. “We have more than enough ability in this country to produce enough oil to make up for the percentage that we buy from Russia,” Rubio said, adding that: “This notion that somehow banning Russian oil would raise prices on American consumers is an admission that this guy, that this killer, that this butcher, Vladimir Putin, has leverage over us.” “I think we have enough that we should produce more American oil and buy less Russian oil or none – actually, none at all,” Rubio added. But the issue of producing more oil in the US is a controversial one, with partisan battles over the role of government in using laws to curb greenhouse gas emissions and wean Americans off fossil fuels in the face of the climate crisis.",News/US news,US in ‘very active discussion’ with allies to ban import of Russian oil,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/06/us-allies-discuss-russian-oil-imports-ban
3/7/2022,"A decision to restart operations at one of Central America’s largest nickel mines is being questioned by campaigners, after an investigation appeared to show the company co-opted indigenous leaders and smeared potential opponents.In 2019, the Fenix project in eastern Guatemala was the subject of an investigation carried out by the Guardian and other media, organised by French consortium Forbidden Stories.In that investigation, residents alleged that the mine – which is owned by Solway, a company based in Switzerland – was to blame for failing crops, polluting the lake and pressing local authorities to quash dissent.As a result of a new investigation by the same consortium, the Guardian visited local communities in El Estor, the municipality surrounding the mine, in January this year and heard from residents and community leaders that claim little has changed. “They said that there would be development [building schools and hospitals], that there would be a change in El Estor, when really there is none,” said Cristobal Pop, 45, the president of the artisan fishers’ union. Officials in Guatemala overturned a suspension of the mine’s extractive activities in January. The suspension had been imposed after the Central American country’s constitutional court ruled, in July 2019, that the mine had been operating since 2005 without having consulted local indigenous communities, as required under international labour law. Guatemala’s ministry for mines and energy said the consultation had “concluded in a satisfactory way”. However, some indigenous communities allege they were not fairly involved. “It wasn’t a consultation, consent was never given by communities, who didn’t have information or freedom,” said Pop, whose fishers’ union brought the case before the constitutional court after a mysterious red stain spread across Lake Izabal, the country’s largest expanse of fresh water, in 2017. Several consultation meetings took place from September to December last year between representatives from the mine, the government and indigenous communities. However, campaigners allege that many of the indigenous leaders included in the consultations were supporters of the mine, and that many members of the community were not consulted. According to information obtained by Forbidden Stories, donations to a foundation linked to the mine appear to have been used for “economic support” to members of one indigenous organisation included in the consultation.In information obtained during the investigation, mining employees also appeared to float the pros and cons of different rumours that could be spread about members of the community, including that some leaders had HIV. The mining company said that foundations in Guatemala are “regulated by the law on non-governmental organisations which defines the rights of foundations not to disclose information on sources of donations and expenditures”. It said the community consultation was conducted by the ministry of energy and mines, as the constitutional court named it in its ruling as the body responsible for carrying out the consultation. Separately, the new investigation uncovered evidence that representatives of subsidiaries of Solway gave Christmas presents to journalists, priests, labour leaders, judges and mayors in the communities of El Estor and the surrounding area in 2016. The company said that giving Christmas gifts was not out of the ordinary. “It is a common practice in Guatemala to send Christmas baskets to friends with whom one has interacted during the year. Christmas baskets are only given to individuals when it is not prohibited by law,” said a spokesperson. On visiting several communities around the mine, the Guardian found that many residents from Maya communities are afraid that they may be forced from their lands. “We don’t want to be relocated,” said Dominga Chub Chub, 28, a resident of the Las Nubes community, which partially sits on land claimed by the mine. “If the company comes and forces us out, where will we take our children?” Other residents feared life in the community would worsen. “The community on this tract of land is at risk of extinction,” said Luis Caal Che, 58, who once led Las Nubes as its mayor and would often negotiate with representatives from the mine. “This community will remain in poverty, the mine will have what is ours and our crops will no longer bear fruit.”The company said it invests in local communities and does not plan to relocate the residents. According to the investigation, there was a significant environmental incident in November 2020, when tonnes of bunker fuel overflowed or spilled, affecting the outflow channels and Lake Izabal. The company said the spill was contained and controlled and that “at no time was the outflow channel or Lake Izabal affected”. Fisher Oscar Cuc Tiul, said that fish populations in the lake continue to dwindle. “There is so much contamination,” he claimed, adding that he now catches deformed tilapia and bream, sometimes referred to by local people as “devil fish”. Protests against the mine broke out in October last year in the run-up to the consultation, with demonstrators angry at what they saw as a rigged process. Roadblocks were put up, cutting off access to the mine and processing plant. The government responded by declaring a “state of siege”, limiting freedoms for 30 days and imposing nightly curfews, while soldiers arrested supposed instigators. “That’s when we could see that the government is in favour of the company, even co-opted by it,” said Olga Che, the treasurer of the fishers’ union and a member of the Council of Ancestral Q’eqchi’ Authorities, whose home was raided after attending protests. Activists accuse the municipal government of siding with the company in disputes, which officials deny.In a statement, Solway said it “refutes the allegations that are without factual basis. Solway is operating in line with applicable laws. Regarding a responsible corporate governance according to international standards, we have taken actions which are also being followed up in dialogue with both the Swiss state secretariat of foreign and economic affairs and the Swiss embassy in Guatemala.”Campaigners say they will continue lobbying the government and the mine for a consultation that includes wider representation. “We are going to carry on,” said Pop. “We will not recognise that consultation for as long as we are alive.”",News/Global development,‘Consent was never given’: indigenous groups oppose restarting Guatemala nickel mine,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/06/indigenous-groups-oppose-restarting-guatemala-nickel-mine
3/7/2022,"Andy Beckett (Pacifists are being elbowed out of British politics just when we need them most, 3 March) appears to think that we have the choice either to be pacifists or to have to “accept that the world is divided into two camps” – the liberal west and a totalitarian Russia. This is nonsense. It is possible to recognise that Ukraine requires the imposition of sanctions on Russia by the west and a ready supply of western arms and money to defend itself, without believing that the west has suddenly transmogrified into a sainted power bloc, cleansed of all past sins. To choose pacifism in the current circumstances is to opt for a groundless idealism over realpolitik. Ukrainian self-determination needs guns and money. To stand against the demand to arm Ukraine is to stand for Ukraine’s defeat. If Stop the War believes that there is nothing progressive about Vladimir Putin’s Russia, then it should want his invasion driven back and his regime’s financial lifeline choked off. Laughably, some on the left have even dragged out the old “the main enemy is at home” slogan – as if the UK was actually at war with Russia rather than simply seeking to support Ukraine. Believing that it’s necessary to oppose Putin’s attempt to drown Ukraine’s right to exist doesn’t mean turning a blind eye to Boris Johnson’s venality or to the proto-fascist leanings of Poland and Hungary, or to alibi the US’s own history of bloody anti-democratic interventions. Right now, though, calling for no sanctions against Russia and no arms to Ukraine means calling for Putin’s victory and its devastating consequences. Orwell was right in 1942 and he would say the same now. Faced with the current circumstances: “Pacifism is objectively pro-fascist.”Nick MossLondon  Andy Beckett’s argument is full of contradictions. He claims that Stop the War upholds the right of the Ukrainian people to “self-determination” as well as Russia’s security concerns. What planet is he on? Russia has invaded a peaceful sovereign democracy and is bombing indiscriminately, killing civilians as well as attacking a nuclear power station. Keir Starmer was right to threaten to expel the Labour MPs who signed a Stop the War statement. Let’s hope that none of them ever become foreign secretary. We all want a just peace.June PurvisPortsmouth  It was a relief to read Andy Beckett’s warning about attempts to silence voices for peace. Guns and bombs have always been the foundation of UK foreign policy, and since the country’s acquisition of atom bombs, the two main parties have held the line together. It is pitiful therefore that Labour MPs who expressed their views by signing a letter should be threatened with expulsion (Report, 2 March). I long to live in a country that focuses its foreign policy on cooperation to end war and poverty, and to save our species from extinction, whether by nuclear war or climate change.Diana FrancisBath  Andy Beckett’s article has some resonance for me on how we challenge oppression. War is the ultimate oppressive force and those who lead us into it are the ultimate oppressors. Pacifists are activists. We do not stand back in our opposition to oppression, we stand firmly against it. Oppression grows when violence, militarism and war are the mechanisms that we use against it. Stop the War is challenging the oppression of war actively and incisively: it is not sitting on the fence, it is not giving succour to “our enemies”, it is making a stand for human freedom and crying out that another way is possible.Richard AshwellWolverhampton  While peace is nearly always preferable to war, sometimes there is a case for a just war, as argued by the Catholic philosopher Thomas Aquinas. The best example of this was the second world war to defeat fascism. Arguably, the same applies to efforts to defeat Vladimir Putin in Ukraine. I have supported Stop the War previously, when I marched against the Iraq war. But it is misguided on Nato expansion and arming Ukraine. Nato responded to requests from former Soviet satellites to join because of their fears of Russia. Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine shows the wisdom of these requests. By arming Ukraine, Nato can at least give it a fighting chance of defending itself without being drawn into a direct conflict with Russia that would spark a war engulfing the whole of Europe.Dr Michael HerronLondon  Lindsey German’s article (We at Stop the War condemn the invasion of Ukraine, and warmongers on all sides, 4 March) is full of the misinterpretation of history. She refers to the breakup of the Warsaw pact and says Nato should have also been dissolved. But the pact was never a partnership of equals. It was a Russian empire. Diplomacy down the barrel of a gun. Nato wasn’t formed to defend against the Soviet Union. It was formed to defend against Russia and its vassals. As soon as the countries that had been invaded by Russia saw a chance for freedom they ran to Nato and the EU in the rightful belief that one day Russia would try to re-subjugate them. Stop the War restates Russian claims that Nato is a threat, but it poses no threat to Russia, only to Russian imperialist ambitions. Nobody is a “war enthusiast”. But faced with a bloodthirsty invader, Ukraine has no option other than to defend itself and we have a moral responsibility to assist it. Should we sit back and allow this atrocity? Putin’s stated objectives allow no room for diplomacy. No country can accept an ultimatum to become the vassal of another. Self-defence is no offence.Jeff BloomLondon  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

3/7/2022,"Your correspondents (Letters, 1 March and 3 March) have missed the point in discussing “semicircular layouts” for parliamentary debating chambers. The benefit of semicircular, or even circular, layouts for such venues, is not that they “get rid of confrontational bear pits”, but that they recognise there are more than two sides to almost any debate, thus discouraging simplistic left-right political dichotomy. Indigenous communities have understood this for centuries with their traditional decision-making circles. But for modern examples, Google “Nunavut legislature image” to see the recently built Nunavut legislative assembly hall in Iqaluit in northern Canada, where respectful political debate rather than purely oppositional decision-making is encouraged. Or consider Aboriginal “yarning circles” in Australia. Then, of course, there’s the circular United Nations security council chamber layout.Philip C StenningEccleshall, Staffordshire  Confrontation is not the essence of debate, but the essence of point-scoring, which is what we see all too often.

3/7/2022,"Senior US officials have flown to Venezuela for rare talks with Nicolás Maduro’s government in an apparent bid to prise the South American country away from its Russian backers after Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. White House and state department negotiators met Maduro representatives in Venezuela’s capital, Caracas, on Saturday in what was the first such encounter in years. Citing anonymous US officials, the New York Times claimed the Biden administration was motivated partly by concern that Russia’s Latin American allies – which include the authoritarian regimes in Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela – could become “security threats” if the geopolitical clash with Putin escalated. Others speculated that the US saw Venezuelan oil as a potential substitute for Russian imports were it to slap sanctions on Moscow as a result of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Venezuela has the world’s largest oil reserves and its output is currently growing despite US sanctions imposed at the height of the 2019 attempt to topple Maduro. Reuters said no agreement was reached at Saturday’s talks. However, some experts believe the encounter could signal a significant shift in US policy towards the crisis-stricken South American country, which has been plunged into humanitarian and political crisis since Maduro took power in 2013. Christopher Sabatini, a senior fellow for Latin America at Chatham House, said the US’s precise objectives were unclear although damaging Russian interests and multi-billion dollar investments in Venezuela was likely high on the list. “Clearly, they want to really try to blunt Russia’s influence in the hemisphere. They don’t want any projections of power,” Sabatini said, adding: “This is also an opportunity to get the US private sector back into Venezuela and squeeze out the Russians.” The US cut diplomatic ties with Maduro in 2019 as Donald Trump’s White House backed an ultimately unsuccessful push to drive him from power by recognising a young opposition politician, Juan Guaidó, as president and attempting to provoke a military uprising. Maduro clung to power in large part thanks to continued economic support from China, Iran and Russia. Recent months have seen growing hints that the US is changing tack on Venezuela under Biden, although officials insist there will be no sudden lifting of sanctions they say are intended to help restore Venezuelan democracy. In an interview with the Americas Quarterly podcast last week, Biden’s top adviser on Latin America, Juan Gonzalez, said the US would continue to recognise Guaidó as Venezuela’s rightful leader. However, Gonzalez left no doubt the new administration had ditched the Trump era effort to overthrow Maduro. “Whereas the previous administration’s theory of change was based on regime collapse, ours is more on the need to recognise that only a negotiation will lead to concrete and sustainable change in Venezuela towards democratic order,” Gonzalez said. Revealingly, even influential conservative voices who once championed Maduro’s downfall are changing their tune. “We need to rethink everything right now –including not allowing Russia to cozy up to countries near us!” the former Fox Business presenter Trish Regan tweeted on Sunday. Regan added: “It’s not just US officials meeting in Venezuela right now – it’s also key executives from MAJOR US oil companies, including Chevron. This is real, folks. If agreements are reached, we will replace Putin’s oil with massive reserves from Orinoco region of Venezuela.” Sabatini said the risk of US efforts to remake its relations with Maduro’s Venezuela was that issues such as human rights and democracy “could get squeezed in the name of realpolitik”. “That would be tragic given the situation in Venezuela … So it’s going to be a delicate diplomatic balance.”",News/World news,US officials fly to Venezuela for talks in apparent bid to further isolate Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/06/us-officials-venezuela-talks-apparent-bid-further-isolate-russia
3/7/2022,"A Texas congresswoman has called for Russia to release Brittney Griner as fears grow Vladimir Putin could use the US basketball star as a pawn during the war in Ukraine. The two-time Olympic champion has been detained by Russian customs authorities, who claim they discovered vape cartridges containing hashish oil in her luggage at an airport near Moscow. The arrest took place last month and the 31-year-old faces up to 10 years in prison if found guilty of bringing drugs into Russia. The Russian Federal Customs Service have released this video in which airport security are seen going through the luggage of a passenger identified as Brittney Griner. pic.twitter.com/gHJ8XoMYvF The situation comes as the US places sanctions on Russia after Putin ordered his forces to invade Ukraine last month. “We know that there were some issues dealing with vape cartridges and other items but let me be very clear,” said Sheila Jackson Lee, who represents Griner’s hometown of Houston, Texas, in Congress. “Brittney Griner is a United States citizen, she was a guest in Russia … and I will be demanding her release.” Lee said that Russia’s actions in Ukraine undermined their detention of Griner. “I don’t want to disregard a sovereign nation but Putin has disregarded sovereign nations his entire service in this world,” Lee said. “Anyone that is killing and attacking and destroying Ukraine, a neighboring country that is not bothering them, has no right to hold Ms Griner. Period.” Meanwhile, a former Pentagon official told Yahoo Sports she feared Griner could become a “high-profile hostage”. “If we want her out of jail, Russia is going to have some terms,” said Evelyn Farkas, who served as the US deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia and Ukraine from 2012 to 2015. “It could be a prisoner swap. They also could use it as an implicit threat or blackmail to get us to do something or not do something. Either way, they find it useful.” In a statement to the Guardian, Griner’s agent Lindsay Colas said: “We are aware of the situation with Brittney Griner in Russia and are in close contact with her, her legal representation in Russia, her family, her teams, and the WNBA and NBA. “As this is an ongoing legal matter, we are not able to comment further on the specifics of her case but can confirm that as we work to get her home, her mental and physical health remain our primary concern.” The WNBA said in a release that Griner has the league’s “full support” and “our main priority is her swift and safe return to the United States”. Griner, like many of her fellow WNBA players, also competes in Russia during the league’s offseason. She has played for UMMC Ekaterinburg since 2015, helping the Russian club to three domestic titles and EuroLeague Women championships in 2016, 2018, 2019 and 2021. Her annual salary of $1m with Ekaterinburg is far in excess of her earnings in the WNBA, where the maximum salary is $228,000. Griner, a 6ft 9in center, is considered one of the best players in the world. She won gold medals with Team USA at the 2016 and 2020 Olympics, the WNBA title with the Phoenix Mercury in 2014 and has been named an WNBA All-Star seven times.",Sport/Sport,Fears grow Russia could use US basketball star Brittney Griner as ‘hostage’,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/06/brittney-griner-arrest-russia-drugs-charges-wnba-basketball-wnba-ukraine
3/7/2022,"Scott Morrison has warned that a “new arc of autocracy” is forming to reshape the world, while pledging to build a new base for nuclear-powered submarines on Australia’s east coast. The Australian prime minister will use a key foreign policy speech on Monday to warn against “a transactional world, devoid of principle, accountability and transparency”. He will describe Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a “major wake-up call” to the west about how autocrats are determined to impose their will, and liberal democracies cannot allow “the pettiness of small differences to infect our relations”. Morrison is set to reveal the government has “provisioned more than $10bn to meet the facilities and infrastructure requirements” for the transition from Australia’s existing Collins class submarines to the nuclear-powered submarines to be delivered under the Aukus pact with the UK and the US. A new base, to be built in Brisbane, Newcastle or Port Kembla, will “enable the regular visiting of US and UK nuclear-powered submarines”, he will say in a virtual address to the Lowy Institute. Two decades after George W Bush denounced Iran, Iraq and North Korea as an “axis of evil”, Morrison will say: “A new arc of autocracy is instinctively aligning to challenge and reset the world order in their own image.” According to speech notes distributed by his office to media in advance, Morrison will say Russia’s “unprovoked, unjust and illegal war” in Ukraine is the “latest example of an authoritarian regime seeking to challenge the status quo through threats and violence”. “We face the spectre of a transactional world, devoid of principle, accountability and transparency, where state sovereignty, territorial integrity and liberty are surrendered for respite from coercion and intimidation, or economic entrapment dressed up as economic reward,” the speech notes say. “This is not a world we want – for us, our neighbours or our region. It’s certainly not a world we want for our children.” Morrison is also expected to say he is pleased Australia has stood its ground, amid growing tensions with China over the past few years, including over what the government has called economic coercion against a range of Australian export sectors.

But the prime minister will say that Australians do not want “timidity and resignation from their leaders”, saying no one wants conflict, “but nor do we want the very world order that underpins our freedoms to be eroded for fear of giving offence”. “Events are now lifting the veil … Australia faces its most difficult and dangerous security environment in 80 years.” Morrison is expected to predict Vladimir Putin will continue “brutal attacks” in what he characterises as the “bloody and violent acts of an autocrat determined to impose his will on others, in the contrived self justification of realising nationalistic destiny”. Morrison will welcome “signs of a more concerted, tough-minded European approach to autocrat adventurism”. That includes Germany supplying Ukraine with anti-tank weapons and increasing defence spending to 2% of GDP, and Sweden and Finland contemplating joining Nato. Morrison will also praise Japan, South Korea and Singapore for joining in economic sanctions against Russia, saying this is “a welcome testimony to international solidarity in our own region”. He will say democracies “must stand together, resolute, against aggression and coercion – wherever it occurs”. “We cannot afford the pettiness of small differences to infect our relations and our long-term cooperation. Our adversaries will ruthlessly look to exploit this.” It is unclear what differences Morrison is alluding to, but the defence minister, Peter Dutton, has previously called on France to put aside any “hurt feelings” over the Australian government’s scrapping of the French submarine contract in order to focus on a shared approach to China. The sudden Aukus announcement sparked a major diplomatic rift with France. Emmanuel Macron accused Morrison of lying to him and the dispute worsened when a personal text message from Macron to Morrison was leaked by the Australian government. Morrison will say the new submarine base on the east coast of Australia will deliver “additional national capacity, not relocating any existing or planned future capacity” at the existing base, HMAS Stirling, in Western Australia. It will “enhance our strategic deterrent capability” and include specialised wharfs, maintenance facilities, administrative and logistics support, personnel amenities, and suitable accommodation for submarine crews and support staff. Amid uncertainty about when the first of Australia’s new submarines will be ready, Morrison will say the new base will also enable the regular visiting of US and UK nuclear-powered submarines. Defence has reviewed 19 potential sites and narrowed them down to three preferred locations. Defence has now been authorised to engage with the New South Wales and Queensland governments, and local governments, to “begin negotiations on what will be an enormous undertaking”. Dutton said on Sunday the government would announce “within the next couple of months” whether Australia would adopt the British or American submarine design, sparking speculation the Coalition might announce this major decision before the election. But Guardian Australia has been told the government is not planning to announce this before the election, given the caretaker mode is likely to begin next month. After the House of Representatives is dissolved, caretaker conventions prevent the government from making major policy decisions that are likely to commit an incoming government, except in consultation with the opposition. Australia, the US and the UK are currently six months into an 18-month study on how the submarines will be delivered. While Morrison has previously said the first submarine was expected to be in the water by about 2040, Dutton argued Australia would “acquire the capability much sooner than that”.",News/Australia news,Morrison decries ‘arc of autocracy’ reshaping world as he pledges to build nuclear submarine base,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/07/morrison-decries-arc-of-autocracy-reshaping-world-as-he-pledges-to-build-nuclear-submarine-base
3/7/2022,"Questions of Australian identity – where has modern Australia come from, and where is it going? – can often feel rather remote to this Bundjalung reader. Why are Australians so nervous of other peoples and of justice? Why are our politicians so unambitious? Why are vulnerable people, especially young women, still routinely preyed upon almost without consequence? Why does the White Australia Policy continue to weigh so heavily on public policy? When you dig down, hidden within these identity issues are serious questions of power: who wields it? Who lacks it? Who dies in our towns and cities and remote areas from not having any, and why? What needs to happen to make that stop – to spread the so-called “luck” around? Mainstream Australia rarely needs to consider who gets to be “lucky” – who gets to be included in the Australian “us”, in the words of Waleed Aly. We who are First Nations, or disabled, or migrant, or Muslim, or in any way seen as marginal by the Anglo centre know how arbitrary that category is. And how quickly it can shift, when convenient. These are serious questions, and they bear examining. Donald Horne famously called Australia the “Lucky Country” and the misnomer stuck. In The Idea of Australia – A Search For the Soul of the Nation, author Julianne Schultz is interested in all these questions. She’s also asking what we can call on, apart from “luck”, to navigate a new century. She argues fiercely that we can do things better, that the nation can choose to look outward, a confident and reconciled Australia, rather than shrink in terror from a world transforming before our eyes. Schultz uses the metaphor of Covid as an X-ray, operating for the past couple of years to show classic Australian fracture lines. Race. Labour versus business. The role of the states, and the question of women’s rightful place. The potential of education to address social problems, and the tendency of the state to weaponise both powerful bureaucracies and silence. The fact that Covid revealed these old fissures is unsurprising. As the saying goes, past performance is the best predictor of future behaviour. Few Indian-Australian citizens who found their navy blue passports useless for re-entering their own country in 2021 would argue that the White Australia Policy is dead and buried. Nor would western Sydneysiders, who were being massively overpoliced in lockdown while eastern suburbs residents went merrily to the beach during lockdown, say that class is done and dusted here. Women like Grace Tame and Brittany Higgins stand at the centre of a storm of female rage that has been brewing for centuries. Covid merely lifted the lid on their discontent. Tanya Day may well have stood with them, but was, alas, destined to die for the unofficial crime of being intoxicated in public while Aboriginal. Unlike Horne’s seminal work, The Idea of Australia is clear-eyed about the hidden centrality of race among these national fissures. Australia is described, accurately, as a place where “forgetting is essential … best we forget would be more honest”. This analysis puts the inability to negotiate a just settlement with First Nations front and centre. “Failure to negotiate treaty was unjust then and inexcusable now.” That national flaw – Australia’s original sin – has set a broader trend in motion. Since before federation, Australia has developed the dangerous habit of living in “a permanent present”, where history is not so much neglected as chained in a dark shed and threatened with a cricket bat if it dares to speak up. We’re big on pragmatism in Australia, big on tying things up with wire, of pushing past uncomfortable truths to the next footy final or xenophobic outburst. Really serious debates are shut down, or papered over. “Immediate issues are solved; big underlying issues are left unresolved.” Schultz, who for 12 years edited the outstanding Griffith Review, ranges far and wide through recent history to explain contemporary Australia. Her razor-sharp analysis is dotted with incidents – some appalling, some hilarious – from her own experience. Raised by poor Lutheran parents in western Victoria and Queensland, she was one of a cohort of bright students to take advantage of Whitlam’s free university scheme. Decades of rubbing shoulders with everyone from outback elders like Hazel McKellar to the business elite of Sydney and even young Muslim leader Yassmin Abdel-Magied have made Schultz into a polymath. There seems to be nothing she hasn’t thought about, deeply. Little wonder she has no patience for the timid and ignorant. Be bold, be bold, be bold, reads her epigraph. There are some terrific anecdotes in these pages, and some truly astonishing confessions from men who have stepped away from massive power. One of the more striking lines comes from the late Packer journalist David McNicoll, reflecting on the role of media in cementing conservative governments in place: “All these seats … would have gone to Labor … without our right wing influence. There’s no doubt of that at all.” In other words, working Australians have been suckered time and again into voting against their own self-interest. Simples! Few ordinary people – those of us who aren’t powerful in big business, or senior in the media or politics – ever get to hear to this kind of stuff said openly by those in the know. And people in power don’t normally spill the beans. The cost is too high: it gets down to fear, once again. “Fear is another plank in the scaffold of silence,” writes Schultz in what is, at its heart, a book about fear. Fear of material losses, fear of ridicule, fear of breaking the lockstep that says neoliberalism is inevitable, sensible, desirable. One notable exception is former prime minister Kevin Rudd, who in 2020 started a petition against what he calls Murdoch’s “cancer on democracy”. Turns out over half a million of us want a royal commission into the influence of one company on Australia’s governance. It’s hard to know whether to be impressed or chilled when reading Rudd’s confession on page 332: “Everyone’s frightened of Murdoch.” But as James Baldwin, a man who knew a great deal about fear, wrote: “Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced.” Be bold, be bold, be bold … The Idea of Australia ends on the central lesson of Covid: governments can do useful things if they choose to. Who knew? Homelessness was cured instantly in 2020 by the stroke of a pen – thousands of street people were housed in motels – just like that! Ditto ingrained poverty – doubling the dole utterly transformed lives for several charmed months. Single parent households ate better; bills didn’t induce suicidal anxiety in the poor quite so often. No billionaires were harmed in the making of these policies, either; quite the opposite. Turns out there is a role for the state in curing social ills after all. And Australians want governments to act – to actually do something for a change. The states saved millions of lives when they did. Fairness matters, just as history matters. A nation mired in a “permanent present” reflects on nothing and learns from nothing, but all people, even in this digital age, live somewhere. We are citizens of geographic places as well as nations; we are all from somewhere, and belong to communities in those places whether we know it or not. Solutions lie in the old-fashioned but indispensable notion of community. There is no reason Australia can’t be made into a decent, fair, reconciled country, if only we find the courage to turn to each other, and make it one. Now there’s an idea.

3/7/2022,"At the time, it certainly didn’t strike anyone as the statement of a caretaker. If anything, the response Mark Rudan gave following Western Sydney Wanderers 1-0 defeat to Newcastle Jets on February 23 was more a campaign speech. Perhaps, given it was delivered to three journalists on a Zoom call at almost eleven o’clock at night, it was even a statement of intent. “It’s a big club. It’s a proud club. And I know exactly what needs to be done moving forward,” Rudan said emphatically. “I’ve said it before: I don’t care about names. You either shape up or ship out. It’s as simple as that.” Flash forward a fortnight, to news Rudan has had the ‘interim coach’ label removed from his title and been awarded a contract until the end of the 2023/24 season, and his words take on a new level of prescience. Whatever masterplan the 46-year-old was concocting was apparently compelling enough to induce Wanderers owner Paul Lederer into entrusting him to helm of their men’s team. Rudan may have won just two games from six before the announcement but from a tactical and technical perspective, it’s a good appointment. After earning a shot at the top through his work at NSW NPL level with Rockdale Ilinden and Sydney United, Rudan oversaw rises at Wellington Phoenix (2018-19) and Western United (2019-21). His knowledge of the game and ability to adapt his style separates him from a number of ALM coaches. His willingness to give once-overlooked players a shot - Max Burgess at Wellington and Tomislav Uskok at Western, for example - is another. Based on what he has previously shown, Rudan is the most capable coach Wanderers have had since their inaugural boss, his friend Tony Popovic (the pair came up together through the ranks of Sydney United’s Socceroo factory under Vedran Rožić in the 1980s). It was fitting, then, that his first win as full-time gaffer - a 2-0 win over bitter rivals Sydney FC in the Derby on Saturday - was described as possessing “hallmarks of the club’s best years.” Rudan was also born and bred in Sydney’s west (ignore the fact he was Sydney FC’s inaugural captain) and it all looks great in a press release. But it’s the details surrounding Rudan’s appointment where the devil lies. In handing Rudan the keys to the ALM castle, Lederer announced that his new coach had been given “direct control of the football department”, . thereby wholly buying into an ‘only I can fix it’ pitch… or proving he was spooked by the interest in Rudan from Macarthur FC. Seemingly little, therefore, looks to have been learned from previous disastrous attempts to cultivate a saviour figure in the Wanderland dugout. Rudan’s predecessor Carl Robinson was the latest in a string of appointments handed near carte blanche to shape the squad as they see fit only to subsequently leave a gaping hole when it all fell apart. Wanderers’ new coach may taste significant success à la Popovic, but what happens when he leaves? The void the latter left when he departed just days out from the start of 2017–18 put the club into a tailspin they still haven’t recovered from. Yet their long-term strategy to return to the promised land and stay there, apparently, is to just borrow Rudan’s vision and hope for the best. There are similar telling examples of a lack of foresight elsewhere at Wanderers Football Park. Examine this year’s ALW finalists - Sydney FC, Melbourne City, Melbourne Victory, and Adelaide United - and it’s notable that all four are the clubs that consistently dedicate not just material resources but also time, care, and intellectual rigour to their women’s programs. The Wanderers, meanwhile, languish at the foot of the ALW league table yet again. Catherine Cannuli’s coaching tenure at Wanderers is similar to Grant Brebner’s at Victory’s men’s side last season: a club legend expected to be a good soldier and take the heat for a task made Sisyphean by a lack of support or direction. “Things need to change here at Wanderers,” defender Caitlin Cooper said after Sunday’s 2-0 loss to Melbourne City. “Each year we’re finishing at the bottom of the table and it’s just not good enough.” The club can point to their facilities - the best in Australia - as an example of their commitment, but until there’s a resilient overarching philosophy Western Sydney Wanderers simply stand as the A-Leagues’ version of a McMansion: superficially luxurious but lacking in individuality or soul. At their birth, the Wanderers quickly became the envy of the league. They sat on the most fertile ground for talent in the country and were embraced by a community that quickly made them the most supported club in the land and the envy of all other ALM clubs. Popovic’s early premierships and shock 1-0 win over Japanese club Kawasaki Frontale in the Asian Champions League then established a winning start. The “big club” title was quickly claimed. But given what’s happened in the past five years, it increasingly appears Wanderers were born on third base and think they’ve hit a triple. The reality is they’re back at the plate trying not to strike out again.

3/7/2022,"I’ve been thinking about Grace Tame a lot in the last few weeks. Wondering how to talk about her with the admiration she deserves, while asking questions about why she in particular has become the face of modern Australian feminism when there are so many other women – Black women in particular – with so much to say and with so many difficult and heart-wrenching stories of their own. Her response to journalists who published photos of her as a teenager goes some way towards explaining it – she is simply remarkable. Still, there are deeper questions about the overwhelming sense that her anger is authentic and true and acceptable, when so often, the anger expressed by Black female activists is seen as toxic, divisive and polarising. I have been wondering about the risks of revealing my private ambivalence about the place she and Brittany Higgins occupy in the national conversation because often white people don’t like to hear hard things about how race functions in this society. It is easy to be accused of making this about race, to be or to be dismissed – ironically for being angry – simply for broaching the topic. It is especially difficult when the entry point into the conversation is a woman who is so supremely admirable. So perhaps, as a starting point, let me be clear that this is not about Grace Tame the person. I am interested in the place she occupies in the national conversation about women’s anger. In recent weeks, Tame’s anger has spawned a thousand think pieces about respectability and rage. For much of her time as Australian of the Year, Tame referred to prime minister Scott Morrison primarily using his first name. It was designed to bring him down a notch and it was highly effective. Each time I watched her call him Scott, I wondered what might have happened had I done the same. While I have been full of admiration, each time Tame has earned the spotlight for her acts, I have imagined the response if I had behaved that way, or if any number of Black and Indigenous women in the public domain had dared to do the same. Tame has certainly had her critics, but her actions have sparked a national conversation that has been carried out with the kind of care I only wish was on hand when angry Black women are in the spotlight. On the other hand, I have yet to see Black women’s anger greeted with the same kind of public solidarity or sympathy. And yet, Black women have been expressing anger for years as they address racist police and education systems, as they try to create opportunities for themselves and face the double burden of sexism and racism. Our anger is not seen as strategic, or tactical, or worthy of analysis. Instead, it is racialised, seen to spring from our “nature”. Like so many negative emotions, anger is seen as an essentialised trait, part of the insidious racist idea that Black people “feel”, while white people “think”. This was evident in the case of Tanya Day. Her family were confident, beautiful, and clear in their storytelling. And yet the country did not mobilise to end deaths in custody, nor did they mobilise to put an end to the wanton harassment of Aboriginal women in public spaces which so often leads to these deaths in custody. To be sure, there was solid coverage of the case, but the anger of Tanya Day’s family at the injustice of their treatment was not amplified in the same way in the media. Instead, over the past year, I have watched the exaltation of angry white women who have finally understood the limits of respectability. I have watched as a narrative emerges of white women as fighters, as eloquent challengers of the status quo, as upholders of the feminist legacy with little to no reference to Black women who have been doing this for years. As with so many other issues, the racial double standard is stark. To be sure, there are also costs to speaking out. I spoke with a friend the other day who was called intimidating and excluded from office socialising because she firmly told a co-worker to stop touching her hair every time they passed her desk. She wasn’t angry, just irritated. But her response was seen as aggressive, and she understood the contours of managing that perception. Speaking out made her a racial threat; the kind of problem this country is still not ready to deal with. Her experience was a stark reminder that Black women have been expressing rage for years, and have often had to deal with the fallout of those expressions alone and without widespread support. To be sure, Tame can’t help that she is petite and blond. She has done nothing to exploit those attributes and has been clear and pointed in her critiques of patriarchy. What is worth pointing out though, is that Tame’s elevation to heroine status is indicative of a women’s rights movement that can still only hear hard truths when they are delivered by white women. Her ascendancy is also indicative of a media environment that creates darlings based on its own image of itself. Last year, Morrison’s admission that his wife had asked him to consider Higgins’ story through the eyes of a father sparked media outrage. I found it hypocritical. Higgins and Tame’s stories were well received for many reasons, but surely one of them is that for many journalists, Tame and Higgins are relatable. Women journalists covering the Canberra beat know women like Higgins or consider themselves to have been proximate to her – smart, educated, ambitious and walking the halls of power. Women across the country hearing of Tame’s story of grooming at a Christian school, find her relatable. They care – in part because yes, she reminds them of themselves and other women they know. It is obvious that white women’s anger follows racialized lines, and that the media follows the stories journalists can relate to. Angry white women herald a new frontier in feminism, while loud black women are considered rude and uncouth. There is no denying the importance of Tame and Higgins’s stories. But it is just as important to question their centrality, to ask why their stories have so much traction when there are so many women whose fights for justice have been long and serious and just as compelling as those of Tame and Higgins. There has been a lot of talk this year, of a reckoning; of Tame and Higgins as the faces of the future. Some of these words have been hard to hear; not because I don’t wish them to be true, but because of how tone deaf they are. There is most definitely a reckoning, but it is one that does not include covering the stories of angry Black women. There is no reckoning for Australian women if the media and the public aren’t able to listen and relate to the stories of Aboriginal women, women in hijab, women whose skin is far “too” dark, and women who live on the wrong side of town; who can’t go to university and who will never report from parliament or file stories in newsrooms. Black women in this country have always stood at the forefront of struggles for justice and equality. From land claims to housing wars; from the fight for citizenship to environmental campaigns, the toughest activists, the most eloquent analysts and most fearsome critics are those who stand outside the circle of power; those who would never be invited to Canberra, those who have been raised in communities for which they have had to organise and fight and rage and keep strategic silences. It’s not just “nice” to include these “other” women in the public discourse; it’s essential. This isn’t a matter of patting Black women on the head and recognising their struggles. It is about accepting that Black women have pioneered the landscape of courage. Tame may be the acceptable face of rage, but everywhere you look there are Black women who continue to be punished for loudly wearing their anger. A real reckoning might aim to fix that.

3/7/2022,"Julian Deridder works at Fred’s Place in Tweed Heads, supplying basic needs such as breakfast and showers to the homeless. Every day he sees new people come in who simply cannot compete in a white-hot local rental market. “Pre-floods the housing crisis was as bad as I can imagine it getting,” he said. “There was barely any private rentals available, even less in terms of social housing. And what private rentals were available were extremely expensive.” Digby Hughes, senior policy officer at Homelessness NSW, describes the Northern Rivers housing market pre-floods as “beyond dire”. “It was as unaffordable as anything else in Australia,” he said. Rental vacancy rates in the region have hovered around 0.6%, according to Leo Patterson Ross, chief executive of the Tenants’ Union of NSW, compared with a healthy natural vacancy rate of somewhere between 3-5%. “Anything under that means there are more tenants than available houses, which puts pressure on prices and people find it hard to find a home. “Below 2% or 1% it really is an awful time to be looking for somewhere to live.” Patterson Ross said while affordability had been an issue in Byron Bay for some time, the problem had spread in recent years as locals began relocating to cheaper surrounding areas. “Places like Lismore that were nice places to live, but weren’t right on the beach, hadn’t experienced that same level of desperation until recently,” Patterson Ross said. Based on SQM Research property data, Patterson Ross estimated the Northern Rivers was 2,300 homes short of a healthy tenancy rate ahead of the floods. Now, would-be renters will not only have fewer properties to bid for but be competing against flood-hit owner-occupiers seeking temporary housing, many of whom will be backed with insurance money. Emily Brady knows all about that. The single mother of two girls aged five and 10 left her Taree rental property recently over a dispute with the landlord that she alleges was manufactured so they could put up the rent. “My friend was offered to inspect the property soon after for $85 more a week than we were paying. “There’s no compassion for families as tenants. They simply wanted more money.” All of a sudden Brady was thrust back into a rental market that she says has tightened dramatically since the floods in Taree in March 2021. At one inspection she saw 100 names on the real estate agent’s clipboard. “That’s when it really sunk in that I’m in trouble here,” she said. Instead, she resorted to buying a 1988 caravan and paying for a powered site. “I’d lived in temporary accommodation previously, when I was escaping domestic violence, and I didn’t want that for my kids,” she said. “I did my best to look at it as an adventure.” Now the heavy rain has rendered the caravan uninhabitable, forcing her to seek temporary accommodation from the Department of Communities and Justice anyway. “I’d worked really hard to get back into the private rental market only to be forced out because I can’t afford it,” she said. “It’s definitely an example of what’s to come for these areas facing flooding now.” Patterson Ross predicted some people would be forced to leave the region, at least temporarily. Others would seek to share houses with extended family or friends, which can be “fine for a week or two but long term it really causes issues, both for people’s health and their relationships really suffer”. Lastly, there would be people who move into long-term homelessness, he said. Hughes said in some towns the situation would be made worse by the fact that temporary accommodation and homeless services themselves have been flooded. Vulnerable people might also be tempted to compromise on the acceptable quality of rentals in a tight market, according to Patterson Ross. “After floods, what you will often see is the integrity of the building has been compromised. So they’re more likely to leak, to develop mould, to suffer from draughts, and harder to keep comfortable in.” He suggested local government areas might require more flexibility to adapt the mix of holiday rentals available through sites such as Airbnb. “It’s a really complex issue, and means balancing the need for tourist money and employment. But at a time like this it highlights you do need the housing to ensure the community can stay, not be displaced and recover together.” Asked for other possible solutions, Hughes said the “bottom line is what we do need is more investment from government in social housing. The far north coast is crying out for social housing.” He also suggested that, as happened in Sydney during Covid lockdowns, the rules around temporary accommodation should be relaxed in order for people to get back on their feet. Having already witnessed a growth in demand for homeless services of 30-40% in the past two years, Deridder said he was struggling to see how the region would cope with another influx. “It’s a bit daunting to think about to be perfectly honest,” he said. “A lot of people are going to be doing it really, really tough.”  You can donate to the Vinnies flood appeal by going to vinnies.org.au/nswfloodappeal or 13 18 12",News/Australia news,‘Beyond dire’: how the Queensland and NSW floods are worsening the rental crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/07/beyond-dire-how-the-queensland-and-nsw-floods-are-worsening-the-rental-crisis
3/7/2022,"Before Michael Hutchence’s traumatic suicide in 1997, and the multiplying tragedies and indignities that followed (the reality program in search of a replacement singer; the Seven Network miniseries; the death of former manager Chris Murphy; guitarist Tim Farriss’s severed finger; his brother and drummer Jon’s recent association with anti-vaccination protests in Canberra), before all of that, INXS were one thing above all else: a brilliant singles band with a shit-hot frontman. If you are looking for anything after 1992’s patchy Welcome to Wherever You Are, look elsewhere; INXS were already on a steep descent by then. Deep cuts? Forget it: if it wasn’t a single, it was mostly filler. INXS’s best songs were precision-tooled pieces of audio engineering, ergonomically crafted for your radio, your car, your hips and your ears. Their greatest hits almost all pick themselves – ranking them, however, is another matter. Here goes … A Rolling Stones-lite rock and soul workout, the fourth single from X still shimmied and shook, although the tide was beginning to run out on the band by the time of its release as a single in February 1991 – the song peaked at No 36 on the Australian charts, 30 in the UK and 46 in the US. But as a live act, INXS were at their peak: a few months later, a gravity-defying performance at Wembley would produce the Live Baby Live album. The third single from INXS’s fifth album Listen Like Thieves showcases the group’s command of space, with its clanging opening chords followed by silence. What follows is lean, taut rock, with only a brief rave-up towards the end breaking the tension between Andrew Farriss’s keyboards, which lift the song up, and Garry Gary Beers’s bass, which continually drag it back to earth. The beginning of INXS’s imperial period was kicked off by a leftover. At the end of recording sessions for Listen Like Thieves, producer Chris Thomas didn’t hear the international hit craved by the group and their US label Atlantic. Trawling through demos, Andrew Farriss brought back a groove called Funk Song No 13. The eventual result was the band’s first US smash; Tim Farriss’s hard funk solo provided the blueprint for Kick. The “do-do-do doo-do-do” introduction is one of those melodies that feels like it was always there – it just took Hutchence until 1990 to sing it. It’s so obvious and innately human that if that was all Disappear was, it would probably still have been a hit. The rest is just scaffolding: the churning chorus is almost superfluous by comparison, with the song resolving to the original idea, capturing the daydreaming bliss of being alone with the one you love. INXS’s fourth album The Swing was well-named: it’s the hinge-point demarcating the band’s early, skinny new wave from the more assured amalgam of pop, rock and funk that followed. It was also a great booty-shaker, with four singles peeled off. The second, I Send a Message, has endured despite its affectations, including Hutchence’s call of “Hey Timmeh!” to introduce Farriss’s on-point solo. Kirk Pengilly’s saxophone provides both accent and melody, and the whole band sound like they’re having a blast. INXS’s last flash of greatness, from 1992’s Welcome to Wherever You Are. By then, Nirvana had blown the superstars of the 80s off the map, and INXS found themselves chasing the pack with a notably harder rock sound. But on this lovely, delicate homage by Andrew Farriss to his baby daughter, the band sounded unabashedly themselves. It was the fifth international single from the album, which did it no favours; its comparatively lacklustre chart performance belied its stature as among the band’s most loved songs. The fifth and final single from Kick, with finger-snaps accompanying Andrew Farriss’s barrelling piano chords. Those snaps demonstrate the unshakeable arrogance of a band at the top of its game: everything INXS tried was working, with every part contributing to the incredibly tight whole. The song’s title was taken by the band’s longtime video collaborator Richard Lowenstein for his excellent 2019 Hutchence biopic. Kick begins with an anomalous song called Guns in the Sky, but that’s really just a scene-setter for New Sensation, which introduces the true sound of the album: relentless Prince-style funk riffs, anchored by a hard four-on-the-floor rhythm. It’s also all about the singer, more than the song. Hutchence is the maximum rock’n’roll star here, his vocal at the top of the mix. The band, laser-focused on chart glory, knows better than to get in his way. After the jaw-dropping success of Kick, INXS weren’t about to mess with the formula, and the follow-up, X, rehashed it, with diminishing creative returns. It was late 1990, and they wouldn’t have the world’s ear for much longer, but for the time being it was still their oyster. The Stones would have killed for X’s lead cut Suicide Blonde, with its honking harmonica lead-off and fiery vocal; Hutchence’s lyrics are a shallow but grim portent of the darkness to follow. Beers’ death-rolling bass underpins all of it. Hutchence’s lyrics stand out here, as he stares down the contradiction of incomprehensible stardom and loneliness: “Rooms full of strangers / Some call me friends / But I wish you were so close to me.” Here, he made the best use of his lower register, recalling the croon of Iggy Pop circa The Idiot. But the chorus of this big piano ballad was made to be sung at Wembley: three words of longing. In essence, By My Side was Never Tear Us Apart II; tellingly, both songs were played at Hutchence’s funeral. With its riff picking up where Tim Farriss left off on What You Need, Devil Inside was both a refinement and a progression. And where What You Need featured Hutchence at his most in-your-face, here, instead, he was sidling up to you and pouring hot wax in your ear. The group was far more effective for his restraint; Farriss’s solo, similarly, is masterful for its economy and sultry tone. Earlier singles Just Keep Walking, Stay Young and The One Thing showcased a lean and hungry new wave band nurtured on the competitive Australian pub circuit. Don’t Change, though, was INXS’s first genuine anthem. The video is both naff and brash: the band is young and beautiful, and the lithe Hutchence has perfected his blend of Jagger, Iggy and Jim Morrison moves. Reserved as an encore until the end of the band’s career, Don’t Change has been covered by Green Day and Bruce Springstreen, neither of whom were able to capture its naive charm. After Don’t Change, this was a quantum leap in sophistication. Produced by Chic’s Nile Rodgers – who pumped up Beers’ bass to an earth-shaking rumble – the first and best single from The Swing served notice that INXS were ready for stadiums. Farriss’s guitar is key here, with sharp funk riffs and serrated counterpoints best heard on the longer album version. And Hutchence’s vocal is sublime, especially on the song’s long, jamming coda: his “Yeah-ahhhhh!” at 4.30 is one of his greatest moments. The drums-and-percussion intro. The whisper – “Come over here”. And then, that killer, chopping riff played by Pengilly, offset by a clipped funk lead by Farriss (another extension of What You Need). Underneath it all, the throb of Beers’s bass at the bottom end. Everything about Need You Tonight is pure desire; Hutchence’s vocal is face-fanning in its carnality. The band’s first and only No 1 in the US, and a No 2 in the UK, this song is – to coin a phrase from another oversexed singer – simply irresistible. It’s a tough call between this and Need You Tonight, but as a classic piece of songwriting, Never Tear Us Apart is INXS’s crowning glory. A large part of its monolithic grandeur lies in its timing. Originally recorded as a blues, it was transformed into a Viennese waltz with dramatic pauses; again, INXS’s mastery of space was at the fore. And in a crowded field, this is Hutchence’s greatest vocal turn: full of warmth and desperation, it’s a love song fit for a million weddings, for a thousand years.",Arts/Music,INXS’s 15 greatest songs – sorted,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/07/inxss-15-greatest-songs-sorted
3/7/2022,"As we approach the final AFLW round, the conversation has been dominated by another social media attack on an AFLW player. Last week Gold Coast Suns forward Sarah Perkins tweeted an apology to supporters for missing what would have been a match winning goal against the Saints, a series of tweets followed criticising Perkins based on her body shape. Countless AFLW players, fans, and commentators rushed to Perkins’ defence, reinvigorating the debate on the dangers of social media for high profile sports people, and driving the conversation about the right to criticise an athlete’s body in the context of performance. Enter Kane Cornes, who declared he ‘hate(d) the term body shaming because I don’t think anyone from a professional sporting sense, when your body is your weapon, can be body shamed.’ Apart from ignoring the historical and gendered aspect of body shaming of women and girls, this opinion is unhelpful and potentially dangerous. Indeed, one of the findings from a recent report into Gymnastics Australia stated that the focus on the ‘ideal body’, in conjunction with weight measurement and body shaming, could ‘result in the development of eating disorders and disordered eating which continue long after the athlete has left the sport.’ Former international athletes have called out body shaming by their coaches and trainers. Olympic medallist Leisel Jones described the dehumanising and humiliating effect skinfold tests had on her as teen, and fellow Olympian Maddie Groves referred to widespread body shaming in swimming as a ‘disgusting open secret’. While the evidence mountsof the harmthis practice does to girls and women in elite sports, men are not exempt. The AFL recently banned pre-draft skinfold tests for AFL hopefuls, acknowledging that without the necessary psychological and dietary support attached to a club, those who miss out are potentially vulnerable to mental health problems relating to body image. The recent death of Shane Warne reminds us how long this has been an issue. Described by teammates and the media as ‘tubby’ in his early days, Warne struggled with his weight even at the peak of his career. In 2003 he risked it all by taking a banned diuretic, which he claimed to have taken so he would look good on TV. Mere days before he was found dead of a suspected heart attack this weekend, Warne tweeted he was embarking on ‘Operation Shred’, which his manager has since described as one of many extreme weight loss programs Warne undertook. Importantly, the dangers of body shaming extend beyond the individual being shamed, particularly when the subject is an admired elite sports star. It sends an unhelpful message to the broader community about what is valued by a sports organisation, and what success is supposed to look like. At a time when women and teenage girls are dropping out of sport in alarming numbers, often citing discomfort with how they look and feel in their bodies, body shaming a beloved footballer like Sarah Perkins sends exactly the wrong message to anyone who has felt their bodies don’t fit narrow definitions of ‘fit’ or ‘healthy’. More relevant to critics such as Cornes, however, is that body shape does not always reflect body condition, nor does it necessarily impact on-field performance. Perhaps the game has changed too much to cite champions such as Tony Lockett, Jason Dunstall, or Robert Dipierdomenico who reached the pinnacles of the game despite bodies that would not pass today’s exacting measures, and barely did then. A more recent example is former Port Adelaide and Hawthorn midfielder (now Gold Coast Suns coach) Stuart Dew who came back from a year out of the game in 2007 to play his best football and share in three premierships with Hawthorn, despite carrying more weight than ever. How many potential stars have been lost from sport as a result of these rigid tests and body shape imperatives? The biggest problem is the message it sends to girls and women. For six seasons, we have been celebrating the influence of the AFLW in empowering women and girls to use their bodies for strength, athleticism, and speed. We speak of how women’s football is a safe space for all people, regardless of appearance, background, disability, sexuality, gender. How it has provided girls with sporting heroes who look like them, and plenty who don’t. And how it has showcased women of all shapes and sizes kicking goals – literally and figuratively – and owning their physicality and their strength like never before. How many girls or young people would have seen the trolling of Sarah Perkins and then checked their own appearance in the mirror? Or asked someone if their jumper is too tight? Their shorts too short? Or worse, stopped playing altogether, so they didn’t have to worry about any of that. I hope none, but I suspect at least some. If so, it would mean the AFLW isn’t the safe space it was meant to be after all. And that would be an enormous loss to Australian sport, and, frankly, for all of us.",Sport/Sport,AFLW kicking goals and shaping the debate on danger of body shaming,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/07/aflw-kicking-goals-and-shaping-the-debate-on-danger-of-body-shaming
3/7/2022,"The Climate Council has issued a pre-election call for all Australian political parties to acknowledge the climate crisis is driving worsening disasters, including the “megafloods” in Queensland and New South Wales. The Australian Industry Group also declared on Monday that Australia’s former competitive advantage in carbon-intensive energy was “gone” and the country needed “coherent and efficient action” to build a new advantage in clean energy. With an election due by May, the Climate Council said “too many leaders” were silent or absent on the climate crisis, and Australians were “paying a high price” for the lack of meaningful action. “Climate change isn’t a footnote to the story of these floods. It is the story,” the Climate Council said in a statement on Monday. The organisation – which brings together climate scientists, health, renewable energy and policy experts – issued a four-point call for all federal political parties and candidates. That includes actively acknowledging “the destructive role that climate change is playing in driving worsening disasters including these megafloods”. “Now is the time to talk about the Morrison government’s inadequate response to climate change, because burning coal, oil, and gas is supercharging extreme weather,” the Climate Council said. “Those who argue otherwise want debate gagged because they are failing to step up on this issue.” The calls come after the latest major assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found global warming caused by humans was causing dangerous and widespread disruption, with many effects expected to be more severe than predicted. Prof Brendan Mackey, the coordinating lead author of an Australia-New Zealand chapter in the report and director of the Griffith University Climate Action Beacon, said last week: “One of the clear projections is an increase in the intensity of heavy rainfall events.” The Climate Council said some politicians claimed the latest flooding disaster was something no one could have predicted. But “scientists have been warning us for decades that climate change will worsen all extreme weather in Australia”. The Climate Council called on all federal political parties and candidates to outline concrete steps to prepare and equip emergency services and communities for inevitable climate-fuelled disasters. It said parties and candidates should also “explain to the public how in the next term of federal parliament you plan to get national emissions plummeting by rapidly scaling up readily available renewable energy and building an economy that is free from fossil fuels”. The organisation’s fourth call for Australian politicians is to ensure that towns, cities and communities are rebuilt in a way that takes into account climate change and makes them more resilient. “Too many leaders are silent or absent,” the Climate Council said. “It’s time to show leadership and step up to the most critical issue not just of our time, but all time. We have everything to lose, the time for action is now.” The Australian Medical Association said last week the devastating floods in Queensland and NSW “added urgency for more to be done to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change”. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said bluntly on Friday: “Let’s face it, it is climate change.” The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has acknowledged that advice from the Bureau of Meteorology indicated climate change was contributing to more regular and severe natural disasters. He said climate resilience must become “part of our everyday planning and preparations”. “There’s obviously a lot of change that’s occurring, and that’s why we’ve got the policies that we have,” Morrison told 6PR on Friday. “But we’ve also got to deal with the practical issues of the here and now, and these impacts will continue.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app The Morrison government last year bowed to growing international and domestic pressure to commit to net zero emissions by 2050, but it refused to lift its 2030 target from the Abbott-era level of a 26% to 28% cut on 2005 levels. Labor has committed to a 43% cut in emissions by 2030, while the Greens’ policy is a 75% reduction by 2030. The chief executive of the Ai Group, Innes Willox, said roughly halving emissions by 2030 “would put Australia in the mainstream of advanced economies”. On Monday the business organisation published its own pre-election energy and climate policy statement. Australia, it said, “needs to prepare the economy and communities for lower demand for emissions intensive exports, pursue all opportunities for clean economy exports, and get ready for carbon border adjustments in major economies”. “The next three years could set Australia up to achieve a new clean energy advantage and a thriving and clean economy,” Willox said. Willox said the closure of coal generators would accelerate, and the transition must be managed effectively to reduce “negative impacts on price, security and reliability”. He said fair treatment of affected workers, communities and supply chains was “essential so that they can thrive”. The leader of the Greens, Adam Bandt, is scheduled to visit Townsville on Monday to pledge to help coalminers to find new work in “another mining job, or a job in metals processing or manufacturing”. Bandt will unveil a policy to create Green Metals Australia, a new body to support new and existing businesses that wish to accelerate the green manufacturing transition. Of the $5.9bn to be invested, $700m would be made available as grants and the rest would be used for concessional finance and purchasing equity. The policy continues the Greens’ push to win support from coal workers in a bid to win a second Senate seat in the Queensland. “Coal is fuelling the climate crisis and making the floods in Queensland and New South Wales worse, but that’s not the workers’ fault,” Bandt said. “Coal workers need to be supported, not demonised.”",News/Australia news,‘It’s not a footnote.

3/7/2022,"In 2011, Frank King was attempting to move his car to higher ground when he was swept away by a raging torrent of water rushing through Grantham in south-east Queensland. King, then 66, managed to grab a tree and held on for 90 desperate minutes as the force of the water tore his trousers from his body. For years afterwards he felt survivor guilt because of the 13 other lives lost in the flash flood that made global headlines that day. When flood victims later called for Grantham to be moved to higher ground, the local council pioneered a land swap, which gave residents a block of land on the high side of town well beyond flood level in exchange for their flooded block. But those who did the swap had to pay to move their house and clear their old block. Despite wanting to go, Frank, his wife Therese and their son Thomas couldn’t afford to take up the offer. “It cost other people almost $100,000. At our age, no one was going to lend us that sort of money,” King said. “What they were offering was totally out of our reach. We couldn’t afford to take it.” This week, the Kings’ property flooded for the third time in 11 years. Again, Frank was in the thick of the action, rescuing neighbour Karen Goodwin from her low-set house as the water reached her chest. Rescued by a State Emergency Services crew, they spent the next three nights at the Grantham fire station until the water subsided. Now, the Kings and Goodwin are among thousands facing the agonising decision whether to rebuild or relocate. Goodwin, 61, whose elderly parents live with her, also couldn’t afford to take up the 2011 land swap. But after the shock of the past week, including a follow-up evacuation on Thursday, she’s desperate to escape the flood-prone plain. She said she had only just returned home to clean up when she was told to leave again. “I was only there five minutes and the [flood] siren went off,” she said. “The water was already across the road … I was crying. I’ve never been a quitter but I’m ready to just walk away. I can’t deal with this. “There is a fear every time it rains – is it going to come up? Will I need to get rescued?” In Chinderah in northern New South Wales, Mick and Kelly Hobbins’ home stands out for its mint-green colour and stained timber patio. You can tell a considerable degree of thought went into the renovation and redecorating that followed the floods in 2017. “See this leather couch,” says Kelly, pointing to the pile of mud-soaked furniture on the curb last week. “I waited 18 weeks for this to be delivered from Italy after the last flood. How stupid.” Kelly’s 50th birthday party, held on their back deck a month earlier, was supposed to herald a change in fortune for the pair, after they lost Kelly’s sister to cancer and one of their two golden retrievers late last year. Ruben, the second dog, died three weeks ago. Now, for the second time in five years, the Hobbins have been hard at work clearing damaged furniture from their home. Last time the water went through ankle deep. They had insurance, unlike many of their neighbours, and didn’t hesitate when it came to rebuilding. While they borrowed money to put an extension out the back of the two-bedroom cottage, they didn’t see much reason to go higher. “Last time was going to be the biggest one we ever saw, once every 100 years,” Mick says. But five years later, the flood waters returned, only this time they gushed 1.2 metres through the house. Still, having lived in Chinderah since 2005, they are keen to stay. But there might be compromises this time. “Last time it was a matter of let’s make (the house) the way we want to. This time it will be let’s make it the way we have to,” Mick says. Asked whether the lower parts of Chinderah should not be rebuilt on again, Mick, who spent decades in Lismore and is familiar with floods, can see both sides. “It’s a hard question because this is people’s homes and that’s where they want to live. “Everyone who’s lived near a river has to understand that rivers flood. You know it’s going to happen again. Hopefully not like this. And hopefully in 95 years not five years. “Saying that, is it going to keep getting worse? Is the next one going to get even higher?” In Grantham, Lockyer Valley regional council has completed the land swap project and has no more land available for people to move above the flood zone. But councillor Janice Holstein said on Thursday the council would consider developing more land – if more of the dozens of residents on the low side of town are willing to move. “We could not stop people rebuilding their place if it was flooded,” she said. For Goodwin, now is “crunch time”. “Right this minute I haven’t got a clue what I’m going to do. Where I’m going to go. “I have to get out. There’s really no choice. I do really have to go.”",News/Australia news,Rebuild or relocate?

3/7/2022,"Fisher Price first released the toy “chatter telephone” in 1961. You know, the one with the red receiver, blinking eyes and a cheerful smile. Chances are, whether you did your dialling in brown flares, denim overalls or unicorn-print tights, you’ve seen or played with one. My youngest uses hers for all sorts of busy important calls. “Hello, my cat’s got a broken leg,” she says. Message delivered, she carefully replaces the receiver and looks at FurBall the polyester cat with concern. It’s strange: my little ones have toys that light up, sing and shake their rump to the latest urban grooves, but despite this they still love playing with their toy rotary telephone. I don’t know how they learned to use it – we’ve never had a home landline. Did we show them once, or did they see it on TV? Perhaps there’s something intuitive in the design. While rotary phones have mostly disappeared from our lives, the toy version is still going strong. As cute as they are, the reason for their ongoing appeal may go a little deeper than good looks. Jules Burder has worked in early childhood education for 14 years. She confirms that the rotary phone – whether in toy or actual form – ticks many developmental boxes. “The repetitive task of rotating the dial builds fine motor skills and dexterity – this helps with pre-writing skills like pen holding,” she says. “The phone also helps with counting, number recognition and even rhythm – you can imagine the click and the zing as the dial is drawn to each selected number.” As I’ve seen with my own children, who make imaginary calls to the vet and place outrageous takeaway pizza orders, Jules also sees the phone as a great opportunity for building language skills. “Pretend play helps young children draw from and reflect on their own experiences and it encourages them to develop an understanding of social norms,” she says. The nostalgia factor may explain why parents keep buying these toys. Lucia Di Mauro, the owner of Stranger Than Paradise toy shop, believes nostalgia plays a large part in the dial phone’s enduring popularity. “We find that parents remember these toys from when they were kids,” Lucia says. “The design is mostly unchanged, and it sparks a memory of love or happiness. In the same way that people want to share a great song or movie, parents [and grandparents] want to pass on this positive experience to their children and grandchildren.” Obviously, its appeal to children is not based on nostalgia: “They don’t know that the toy is modelled on an old item that is no longer produced. It’s a multifaceted toy that offers many types of play, and that is what kids love.” Flick Davies, the store manager of Honeybee Toys, stocks a wooden Grimm’s rotary telephone. She finds that, rather than the adults seeking it out, it’s the children who gravitate towards it. “It seems they can’t help but pick it up,” she says. “Instinctively they know what to do with it – it’s got a receiver like mummy’s phone … that just happens to be attached by coloured string.” With all the whizz-bang toys on the market, it’s somehow comforting that the lower-key rotary phone has endured. Davies has noted a definite trend towards more classic toys that stimulate free play and imagination. Finally, I ask toy expert, 2.75-year-old Edith, what she likes about it. As she drags the phone up and down the hallway, she stops, blinks furiously at me then carries on. Ah yes: the phone has blinking eyes.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Ringing up baby: why rotary dial toys survived the rise of smartphones,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/07/ringing-up-baby-why-rotary-dial-toys-survived-the-rise-of-smartphones
