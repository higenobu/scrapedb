3/19/2022,"Jazz Jennings continues to share her weight loss journey with followers, giving a look into her workouts with brother Sander Jennings. The 21-year-old I Am Jazz star has been sharing her life as a transgender teen and young adult on television since 2015, where she's discussed medical appointments, mental health and LGBTQ issues. But the latest journey that she's sharing with audiences is about her weight. In a video posted to her Instagram feed on Thursday, Jazz shared what a workout with one of her older brothers looks like during a session of ""Boot Camp with Sander."" ""So I woke up early and I’m feeling motivated,"" Jazz said in the video before doing her workout. She went through jumping jacks, planks and wall sits with plenty of motivation from Sander before sharing that she was ""already struggling"" five minutes into the workout. ""It's OK, though,"" she added. ""We got to start somewhere."" People showed Jazz love and support in the comment section, cheering her on through for hard work. ""Congrats on starting your journey! Be consistent and celebrate all your wins!"" one person wrote. Another commented, ""You got this!!! It will be hard but you have gotten through so many obstacles in life already. You will conquer this one!!!"" Jazz has become more open about her body and her health journey since sharing a side-by-side photo in June 2021 on Instagram, where she said that she had gained almost 100 pounds in under two years. ""I suffer from binge-eating disorder, a disease in which I’m not only addicted to food, but I eat it in large quantities,"" Jazz wrote, explaining that both her binging and some of the medications she's taking contributed to the weight gain. ""I’m posting this photo because it’s time for me to address my weight gain and hold myself accountable. I’m ready to change my ways."" Jazz has become more vocal about her struggles with body image and movement, as well as her stance on body positivity and loving her body as it is.    A post shared by Jazz (@jazzjennings_) ""I honestly feel beautiful every shape and size,"" she said in response to a fan question on I Am Jazz. ""But I will say I’m trying to lose weight for health reasons. I have to feel good too and I don’t feel good with some of the foods that I’ve been eating and so I really am working on this weight loss so I could be healthier and just more me.""

Jazz Jennings has spent most of her life in front of the camera, sharing her story as a transgender teenager on the show, I am Jazz. From her mental health to medical appointments, Jennings has remained open about her struggles along the way, and in the upcoming 7th season, the LGBTQ+ activist gets candid about her weight.
Last summer, Jennings posted a photo wearing a swimsuit on the beach, after doctors suggested that she lose weight before having a medical procedure. “That moment last year was really important because I was showing my from the surgery  — the gender confirmation surgery. Because I had to undergo a special surgery, they had to use extra skin graphs, so in most people don't have scars like that, but because of my special surgery, I have those scars and I'm proud of them.”
Though Jennings has gained weight since taking that photo, she assures fans that her focus on weight loss has little to do with vanity. She remains committed to living and eating better for her health, not her size. “I love myself and my body every shape and size that I am. You know, even being a bigger girl now, I still love my body and I love being me,” says Jennings.
Now 20, Jennings is ready to tackle her next challenge. After taking some time off after high school, Jennings is excited to start college and embark on a new chapter in her life — dating. Identifying as pansexual, Jennings says that the only thing she is looking for in a potential partner is authenticity. “I look at a person's soul and energy rather than their exterior shell. I think the body is just a vessel and that a person's core lies within, and I'm just more attracted to a person who has a beautiful soul. So whether they're transgender, cisgender non-binary, whatever their religion, sex orientation is, it doesn't really matter to me. I just love a person for being them,"" says Jennings.

3/19/2022,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping told his U.S. counterpart Joe Biden on Friday that the Taiwan issue needs to be handled properly to avoid a negative impact on Sino-U.S. relations, according to Chinese media. China says Taiwan, which it views as a breakaway province to be brought back to the fold, by force if necessary, is the most sensitive and important issue in its relations with the United States. Washington, which is seeking Beijing's help in restoring peace in Ukraine after Russia's Feb. 24 invasion, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taipei, but is Taiwan's most important international backer and arms supplier. ""Some individuals in the United States are sending the wrong signals to pro-independence forces in Taiwan, and that's very dangerous,"" Xi told Biden on a video call. ""If the Taiwan issue is not handled properly, it will have a subversive impact on the relationship between the two countries."" China sailed its aircraft carrier Shandong through the Taiwan Strait, shadowed by a U.S. destroyer, on Friday, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters, just hours before the Chinese and U.S. presidents were due to talk. China has over the past two years stepped up its military activity near the island to assert its sovereignty claims. ""(We) hope the U.S. side will pay adequate attention (to the issue),"" Xi told Biden. Xi also told Biden that the war in Ukraine must end as soon as possible, according to Chinese state media. All parties should jointly support the Russia-Ukraine dialogue while the United States and NATO should also conduct talks with Russia to solve the ""crux"" of the Ukraine crisis, Xi said.

3/19/2022,"ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — The president of Turkey, South Korea’s prime minister and other officials inaugurated a massive suspension bridge Friday over the Dardanelles Strait that connects the European and Asian shores of the key waterway. With a a 2,023-meter (6,637 feet) span between its towers, the “1915 Canakkale Bridge” becomes the world’s longest suspension bridge, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said. It connects the town of Gelibolu, located in the European side of Turkey's northwestern province of Canakkale, with the town of Lapseki on the Asian side. The bridge allows travelers to cross the Dardanelles — which connects the Aegean Sea with the Sea of Marmara — in just six minutes compared to the previous 1 1/2 hours by ferry, the president said. “Turkey has overtaken Japan, which has the longest bridge in the world in terms of the midspan, and has taken the first place,” Erdogan said during the inauguration ceremony. The inauguration was timed to coincide with the 107th anniversary of Turkey’s World War I naval victory over a joint British and French fleet attacking the Dardanelles. The failure of the naval campaign led to the ill-fated 1915 landings on the Gallipoli peninsula by the allies led by Britain and France along with troops from Australia and New Zealand. “The 1915 Canakkale Bridge will leave this history of collision and conflict behind and will be a bridge between East and West, starting a new era of peace and prosperity,” South Korean Prime Minister Kim Boo-kyum said during the ceremony, in reference to the Canakkale region's historic battlefields. The bridge, which was build by a consortium of Turkish and South Korean companies, will also strengthen the bonds between Turkey and South Korea, Kim said. The “1915 Canakkale Bridge"" cost 2.5 billion euros ($2.7 billion) to build but Turkey will save 415 million euros ($458 million) per year from a reduction of fuel consumption and carbon emissions, Erdogan said. He announced the bridge’s toll will be 200 Turkish lira ($13.60). The bridge’s architecture is awash with symbolism. It’s central span of 2,023 meters (6,637 feet) is in recognition of the year 2023, when Turkey celebrates the centenary of the founding of the Turkish Republic following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Erdogan said. The height of the bridge’s towers is 318 meters (1,043 feet) — a nod to March 18 (or 3/18) when Turkey commemorates soldiers killed during the Gallipoli sea and land battles. The World War I Gallipoli campaign aimed to secure a naval route from the Mediterranean Sea to Istanbul through the Dardanelles, and take the Ottoman Empire out of the war. The April 25, 1915 Gallipoli landings marked the start of a fierce battle that lasted for eight months. Around 44,000 Allied troops and 86,000 Ottoman soldiers died in the fighting.",World/Associated Press,Turkey builds massive bridge linking Europe and Asia,https://news.yahoo.com/turkey-builds-massive-bridge-linking-164842774.html
3/19/2022,"Don’t even think about it. We’re talking about the Orbeez challenge. The what challenge? Law enforcement agencies throughout Florida as well as the rest of the United States are warning the public against this dangerous social media trend that has recently gained traction with spring breakers. The TikTok fave involves shooting people with toy guns filled with Orbeez, colorful polymer beads that expand when wet. Pranksters (usually teens, cops say) are inserting the gelatinous beads into modified water or BB guns and blasting them from their cars. Though spongy, the Orbeez can cause serious injury as well as incite panic, the cops say. Earlier this week, the Pasco County Sheriff’s Office sent out a release telling parents to warn their kids about the risks of this stunt. Not only could the Orbeez hurt someone; a cop could mistake the toy for an actual gun and respond accordingly. “Do not trespass, and avoid wearing dark colored clothing when participating in this trend. Ensure that water or BB guns aren’t painted dark colors and avoid participating during dusk or nighttime,” said the PCSO. “Additionally, never shoot at people, animals or property.” Over in Volusia County, the sheriff’s office is equally concerned. On Wednesday, the agency reported they made four arrests of teens involved in random Orbeez-related attacks. “Just be aware that these shootings are crimes, and when you’re identified you may face criminal charges for your part in the challenge,” said the VSCO. Cops up north in Fernandina Beach just saw two separate incidents of this disturbing trend. “The Orbeez is soft, non-toxic, and biodegradable, but could cause injury if striking a person at a high speed or in a sensitive area such as the eyes,” said a post from the local police department. “This ‘trend’ also has the potential to cause fear or panic.” Police departments are urging parents to speak to their kids about the risks and for citizens to participate in this trend responsibly.",U.S./Miami Herald,What is the ‘Orbeez challenge?’ Florida cops warn about dangerous social media trend,https://news.yahoo.com/orbeez-challenge-florida-cops-warn-174748002.html

 House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) on Friday said Republicans would boot House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) from the committee altogether if they attain the majority in the midterm elections. At his press conference Friday, McCarthy accused Schiff of politicizing the committee, said he didn't warn the public about Ukraine or Afghanistan and alleged he lied about intelligence regarding President Biden's son Hunter Biden. ""Why is he still chair of the committee and why is he still even on the committee? In a new Congress, if it's a new majority, he will not be,"" McCarthy said. ""You cannot make this committee political, you cannot use it as a position of chairman to lie, and you should be focused on what the American people want you to be focused on around the world,"" he added. It's not the first time McCarthy has made a similar vow. He previously threatened to retaliate against Democrats for their votes in the last year to remove Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) from committees for invoking political violence in their rhetoric. In January, he said he'd remove Schiff and Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) from their respective committees.
