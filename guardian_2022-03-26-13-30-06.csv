My prayers and condolences are with him and his family right now. @foofighters @933WMMR pic.twitter.com/RhlQ5xPYgG After Foo Fighters founder and frontman Dave Grohl, Hawkins was probably the most prominent member of the group, regularly appearing alongside Grohl in interviews and playing roles in the band’s videos. He also starred in Foo Fighters’ recently released horror-comedy film Studio 666 in which a demonic force in a house the band is staying in seizes Grohl and makes him murderous. In the film, Hawkins and other members of the band, Pat Smear, Rami Jaffee, Chris Shiflett and Nate Mendel,are killed off one by one. The film’s premise came out of their work on their 10th studio album at a home in Los Angeles’ San Fernando Valley. Grohl was the drummer for Nirvana when Kurt Cobain killed himself in 1994. Hawkins is survived by his wife, Alison, and their three children.",Arts/Music,"Taylor Hawkins: Foo Fighters drummer dies aged 50, band announces",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/26/taylor-hawkins-foo-fighters-drummer-dies-age-50
