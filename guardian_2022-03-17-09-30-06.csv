3/17/2022,"Jurgen Klopp promised Manchester City a “proper fight” for the title after Liverpool pulled to within a point of the long-standing league leaders. Goals from Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino ensured Liverpool overcame Arsenal at the Emirates despite not being at their best. They have now won nine straight top-flight games and, after facing Watford next time out, will travel to play City on 10 April. It could be a decisive encounter and Klopp feels his players are ready to battle for top spot until the end of the season. “We play City in three or four weeks and then we will give them a proper fight,” he said. “I don’t think a lot about City, that’s the truth. I know the only chance we have is to win an incredible amount of games because our opponents do. In last few years we’ve pushed each other on insane levels. “It makes each game a final. You can enjoy that for sure but it’s intense, then comes in the physical part and you are tired.” There is a sense Liverpool have the momentum required to leapfrog City but Klopp played down any idea that it could be relied on. “Momentum is the most fragile flower on the planet,” he said. “Someone steps on it and then it’s gone. I’m not a big friend of momentum. Just find a way to get through it.” Mikel Arteta felt Arsenal had more than matched Liverpool between the penalty areas. “From box to box in many moments I think we were the better team,” he said. The Arsenal manager saved his ire for the Premier League. Arsenal play away at Aston Villa on Saturday at 12.30pm and, in April, will have to stomach a similar double-header when they play Chelsea and Manchester United within 72 hours. “Thank you so much to the Premier League to do that,” he said of this week’s tight turnaround. “And they’ve done it again when we have to play Chelsea and Manchester United. So if they want to give them any advantage, I say to them today: ˜Thank you so much for doing that’.” “Don’t worry, the players on Saturday they will be there, with energy. They will eat and sleep well, but thank you so much to the Premier League for putting the fixtures like this. Very, very helpful. It is not fair what they have done.” Arteta claimed Arsenal suffered such conditions more than most. “It is always ‘it’s BT, it’s Sky, it is this, it’s that’,” he said. “But the one that is affected is Arsenal and the only thing that I care [about] and we care [about] is Arsenal. And for Arsenal it is not fair.”",Sport/Football,Jürgen Klopp promises Manchester City ‘a proper fight’ for league title,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/17/jurgen-klopp-promises-manchester-city-a-proper-fight-for-league-title
3/17/2022,"Former prime minister Gordon Brown has warned the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, that millions more people will be plunged into fuel poverty unless the government uses next week’s spring statement to ease the UK’s cost of living crisis. A letter to the chancellor, organised by Brown and signed by more than 70 Labour local government leaders, urged the chancellor to adopt a five-pronged approach to help those struggling to make ends meet. “April 2022 brings us the worst cost of living crisis for half a century. Six million low-income families have already lost £20 a week because of the cut in universal credit in October,” the letter says. “Further cuts in the value of their incomes, as heating bills surge and food bills soar, will deepen the cost of living crisis millions face. They are unfair and for millions will be unbearable, pushing them over the edge into extreme poverty and unable to afford to heat their homes or provide the nutrition their children need.” Sunak is urged to: Halt the 1.25 percentage-point increase in employee national insurance contributions. Restore the £20 a week taken away from 6m households last October. Provide significantly greater help for energy costs, targeted at the poorest households. Put in place support for insulation costs for the poorest households as part of a programme for housing retrofits. Update benefits this year in line with inflation rates. Last month the chancellor announced a package of help with rising energy bills. Sunak provided a £200 discount on this year’s bills to be repaid at £40 a year and reduced council tax bills by £150 in England and Wales, with commensurate sums made available to the devolved administrations in Scotland and Northern Ireland. He is now expected to provide more assistance in next week’s statement. Torsten Bell, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said the most likely measures were a cut in fuel duty and uprating benefits in line with the 7% to 8% inflation rate expected in April. Brown said even with the help currently being provided, the number of people in fuel poverty – where more than 10% of a household’s net income is spent on energy – would rise from 4.7 million to almost 8 million when the price cap that puts a ceiling on bills is lifted from £1,277 to £1,971 a year in April. Based on projections showing the price cap being raised to £3,000 in October, researchers at York University estimate the total in fuel poverty would rise to 12 million in the absence of any further government support. The letter has been signed by – among others – the first minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford; the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan; and the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham. It says: “Families and communities in every part of the United Kingdom face a heavy price of severe hardship, and each of us is deeply concerned about the damage that will be done to the cohesion of our whole country. “In response, a group of us including the first minister of Wales, Metro Mayors, and local authority leaders have come together from all parts of the country to make a special and unprecedented plea to the chancellor. “We are already seeing the impact of rising poverty in all our areas. Nothing less than these five measures, introduced simultaneously on 23 March, can prevent fuel poverty hitting millions more in our country, and stop poverty as a whole rising faster than at any time in recent history. At stake is unacceptable and avoidable suffering for millions of our fellow citizens – and especially for millions of children – across our communities.” A government spokesperson said: “We recognise the pressures people are facing with the cost of living, which is why we’re providing support worth £21bn this financial year and next to help. This includes putting an average of £1,000 more per year into the pockets of working families via changes to universal credit, freezing fuel duties to keep costs down and helping households with their energy bills through our £9.1bn energy bills rebate. “We’re also boosting the minimum wage by more than £1,000 a year for full-time workers and our £500m household support fund is helping the most vulnerable with essential costs.”",News/Business,Gordon Brown urges Sunak to address cost of living crisis in spring statement,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/17/gordon-brown-urges-sunak-to-address-cost-of-living-crisis-in-spring-statement
3/17/2022,"Tech bosses face the threat of prosecution and up to two years in jail if they hamper investigations by the communications watchdog from next year, under a wide-ranging overhaul of a landmark online safety bill. The government has reduced a grace period for criminal prosecution of senior managers by 22 months from two years to just two months, meaning tech bosses could be charged with offences from early next year. The change was announced as the government publishes a revamped online safety bill, which places a duty of care on social media platforms and search engines to protect users from harmful content. The new measures include:  New criminal offences in England and Wales covering cyberflashing, taking part in digital “pile-ons” and sending threatening social media posts.  Tech firms must prevent scam adverts from appearing online.  Big platforms must tackle specific categories of legal but harmful content, which could include racist abuse and posts linked to eating disorders.  Sites hosting pornography must carry out age checks on people trying to access their content. The updated legislation introduced to parliament on Thursday confirms, and brings forward, UK-wide proposals for a fine or jail for senior managers who fail to ensure “accurate and timely” responses to information requests from regulator Ofcom. It introduces a further two new criminal offences that apply to companies and employees: tampering with information requested by Ofcom; and obstructing or delaying raids, audits and inspections by the watchdog. A third new criminal offence will apply to employees who provide false information at interviews with the watchdog. Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, said tech firms have not been held to account when abuse and criminal behaviour have “run riot” on their platforms. Referring to the algorithms that tailor what users see on social media platforms – which have been heavily criticised during scrutiny of the draft bill – she added: “Given all the risks online, it’s only sensible we ensure similar basic protections for the digital age. If we fail to act, we risk sacrificing the wellbeing and innocence of countless generations of children to the power of unchecked algorithms.” The legislation’s duty of care applies to internet companies which host user-generated content – such as Twitter, Facebook and TikTok – and search engines such as Google. It is split into several categories which include: limiting the spread of illegal content such as terrorist material, child sexual abuse images and hate crime; protecting children from harmful content; and for the biggest platforms, protecting adults from legal but harmful content which is likely to include racist abuse and content linked to eating disorders. The priority categories of legal but harmful content, which tech firms will be required to police, will be set out in secondary legislation. The government argues that this means the definition of harmful content will not be delegated to tech executives. Nonetheless, civil liberties groups are concerned that this will give ministers the power to censor content. On Wednesday the Open Rights Group called the bill an “Orwellian censorship machine”. Companies that breach the act face fines levied by Ofcom of up to 10% of global turnover – which in the case of Facebook’s parent would be nearly $12bn (£9.2bn) – or £18m, whichever is higher. The watchdog will also have the power to block sites and apps under the bill, which is expected to become law at the end of the year. Other changes in the bill include giving users on the biggest social media sites the option of blocking anonymous accounts, in a move designed to counter online trolls. Large tech firms will be expected to provide “risk assessments” to Ofcom in which they will detail how their platforms could cause harm to users – including the workings of algorithms – and the systems they have in place to prevent those harms. Dorries told ITV’s This Morning programme on Wednesday: “It’s the algorithms that cause the harm, so this bill will compel those platforms to expose those algorithms to our regulator so they can pick up where the harm is happening and hold those platforms to account.” The bill will exempt content from news publishers and journalists from censorship, although Dorries qualified on Wednesday that all journalistic content would be protected “providing it’s legal”. Platforms that seek to remove journalistic content must give notice of its removal and allow for an appeal against the takedown, Dorries added. The bill also contains provisions protecting content of “democratic importance”, which is designed to protect political debate. The bill’s publication came as Instagram, owned by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, launched new tools for parents and guardians to monitor teens’ use of the platform. Starting in the US, the measures include receiving updates on the accounts that teenagers follow and setting time limits on use of the platform. Meta also unveiled new parental controls for its Oculus virtual reality headsets, including giving parents the ability to block access to certain apps. Zuckerberg’s embrace of the metaverse concept – where people interact in a blended virtual and physical world – has triggered warnings that VR will unleash a new wave of problems with policing digital platforms.",News/Technology,Tech bosses face jail if they hamper Ofcom investigations from next year,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/17/tech-bosses-face-jail-if-they-hamper-ofcom-investigations-from-next-year
3/17/2022,"Bruno Fornaroli is in the running to make an unlikely Socceroos debut at the age of 34, after the Uruguay-born striker was included in an extended squad for Australia’s upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Japan and Saudi Arabia. Fornaroli, who was recently granted Australian citizenship after arriving in the country in 2015, has opted to switch his national allegiance in the twilight of his career, having already represented Uruguay’s under-17 youth team in 2003. The Perth Glory veteran’s paperwork has been submitted to Fifa and is expected to be rubber-stamped in time for Thursday’s must-win games in Sydney against Japan and Saudi Arabia a week later. Since arriving at Melbourne City seven years ago, Fornaroli has forged a reputation as one of the A-League Men’s best strikers. In 138 combined matches for City and Glory he has found the back of the net 81 times. His path to Socceroos contention is mirrored by that of Gianni Stensness, who represented New Zealand at youth level but has also been called up for Graham Arnold’s 27-man list, which features a total of five uncapped players, three of whom are involved for the first time. Along with Fornaroli, Nathaniel Atkinson and Nicholas D’Agostino will get their first taste of a Socceroos camp in Sydney next week, while the uncapped Kye Rowles has been called up again. City striker Jamie Maclaren is expected to lead the line against Japan, but will have to depart the set-up ahead of the trip to Jeddah due to his upcoming wedding. The next few weeks shape as critical to the fortunes of Graham Arnold’s side, who find themselves in third place in Asian qualifying group B, three points behind Japan and a further point off group leaders Saudi Arabia with two games to play. The top-two teams qualify automatically for the tournament later this year, while the third-placed team face a further intercontinental tie to reach Qatar. The Socceroos have already guaranteed at least third place, but back-to-back wins at Stadium Australia next week and at the King Abdullah Sports City the following Wednesday will secure an automatic place at the World Cup. “This window represents a great opportunity for our players and staff to do something truly special for Australian football, and we will be focusing all our energies on producing two great performances against Japan and Saudi Arabia and lifting the Socceroos to the World Cup,” Arnold said. “But I truly view March 2022 as a win-win window for this group. With a play-off spot for June already locked in, if required, the players will be able to come to camp with clear minds as to what’s ahead of them, and enjoy the time that they have working hard together and playing in front of their family, friends, and fans.” Arnold said he had been “energised” by the response of the new faces in the camp to their call-ups. “That it means as much to a Bruno [Fornaroli], Nathaniel [Atkinson], Nick [D’Agostino], Kye [Rowles], or Gianni [Stensness], players who have yet to take the pitch for Australia, as it does for a Maty [Ryan] or ‘Lecks’ [Mathew Leckie] highlights to me that they can’t wait to be back together to tackle this challenge head on and continue this great journey together.”",Sport/Football,Bruno Fornaroli named in Socceroos squad for crucial World Cup qualifiers,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/17/bruno-fornaroli-named-in-australia-socceroos-squad-for-crucial-world-cup-qualifiers-japan-saudi-arabia
3/17/2022,"Andrew Macpherson bent down and gave his niece, Charlie, a cuddle. He managed to manufacture a smile, but it was only for the six-year-old’s benefit. The night before this morning had been a bad one. His sister, Laura Clarke, had raced over to his place to pick him up and found him in a state she had seen before. “I drove him back to my house, he cried the whole way,” Clarke says. “Like a baby, just broken. He had drank and was devastated he’d let himself get to that point again.” She sat at the foot of her little brother’s bed until he fell asleep. When he left early the following morning no one was up except for Charlie. The little girl kissed her Uncle Mackie goodbye. Then he went home and took his own life. Macpherson played footy for some two decades, throughout school and in the West Australian Football League. He spent much of that time running at bigger men and landing himself in hospital with concussions. That is before considering the many more sub-concussive blows he likely sustained. For a while after his death, as the family awaited autopsy results from the Australian Sports Brain Bank, Clarke told her two daughters that Macpherson had died after an accident. They thought it meant a car accident. “I struggled with it,” Clarke says. “Charlie is a really deep thinker. They had a particularly lovely bond – she adored him.” A few months later Clarke changed the story. “I said Uncle Mackie’s brain was broken and that caused his death.” This time she was telling the truth. His brain was broken, riddled with chronic traumatic encephalopathy lesions which scientists labelled “strikingly abnormal” for a 33-year-old. A year before Macpherson died on 28 February, 2021, he had made a first suicide attempt while in the depths of addiction, bouts of mania and impulsivity. Initially he did not understand what was going on, all he knew was that he was not himself. But during the intervening 12 months he watched the documentary on NFL player-turned-murderer Aaron Hernandez and became certain he, like Hernandez, had CTE. Some of his own symptoms felt similar, and he asked his family in advance to donate his brain for testing. The autopsy found six CTE lesions and a large amount of a protein called tau – the marker for the progressive and fatal brain disease, which is associated with repeated traumatic brain injuries and manifests as behavioural changes, mental health issues, impulse control problems, memory loss and other cognitive impairment. “There was a significant burden of tau in his brain, which is strikingly abnormal,” says Michael Buckland, the executive director of the Australian Sports Brain Bank and the neuropathologist who examined Macpherson’s brain. “He had half a dozen CTE lesions in the blocks we looked at, but in pretty much every block we looked at from his frontal cortex there was a bit of tau. That isn’t a CTE lesion as it’s defined, but I would expect, if I studied the frontal cortex of a normal 33-year-old male, I would find nothing.” Macpherson’s brain is among 21 to have been tested by the Brain Bank since its inception in 2018. In preliminary findings released last month, the researchers found CTE in 12 of that cohort, a disturbing sample-sized glimpse into what scientists believe is an undiagnosed epidemic. He is one of three under the age of 35. For the first 30 years of Macpherson’s life he was the quintessential charmer, an initially shy dyslexic Perth boy who painted his Rossmoyne bedroom West Coast yellow and blue, and grew in confidence each time he stepped onto an Aussie rules field. The general consensus is he was charismatic, good looking and quick-witted, but always selfless. He was everybody’s best friend. Everyone had an Andy Mac story. “He had this gravitational pull,” says friend and former East Fremantle teammate, David Bongiascia. “He would turn an average night into a fun night, just because he was there.” No one, though, was as fond of him as his mother. The running family joke was that Anne-Marie loved her two children 100%: Laura 5% and Andrew 95%. He called her “mummy” his entire life. Macpherson spent his high school days riding his dinghy across the Canning River to Aquinas College, for whom he played in the firsts and developed a reputation as a lockdown defender who “didn’t take a backward step”. “His courage on the football field was the highest courage level in the team by a long way,” says best friend and former teammate, Alex Mcleod. “When we were 17 he got taken away in an ambulance twice – and we only had 10 games that year. “I just remember him going for the ball with a bloke who was a fair bit bigger than him and his head hitting into this guy’s shoulder while he was side on. He was out cold straight away, for more than a minute. “This was in the early 2000s so it definitely wasn’t like it is now where you’ve got to have the mandatory week off after. He definitely played the week after. I would’ve seen another four or five big ones in the next three or four years and there were another couple when we played in Melbourne together after the WAFL.” A neck brace became a regular accessory for Macpherson. The school nurse said one of his concussions was the most severe she had ever seen. Another time, his late father, Patrick, spotted him throwing up off the side of the oval. He asked his son if he had told the coach. Macpherson responded no, because he wanted to play the following week. “He would often play a role where he’d come off his man,” Bongiascia says, “float across packs and run back with the flight of the ball to try to assist other defenders. And when you’ve got someone coming the other way you get cleaned up. “I don’t think it’s wrong in saying Macca probably wasn’t the most skilful player I’ve ever played with, but I’d struggle to find a braver player. He played with ferocity, and that ferocity put him in the line of some hits.” Macpherson was 18 when he made his senior debut for East Fremantle against Subiaco in 2005. In his very first contest he tried to take out all 120kg of an opposing ruckman and came off second best. For four years until 2009 he was one of the most disciplined backmen in the WAFL, beating the likes of Jeff Farmer, Paul Medhurst and Hayden Ballantyne. At one point he came close to being drafted in the AFL and had talks with North Melbourne, though the step up never came to fruition. “He ended up doing a business degree,” Clarke says, then laughs. “Or I ended up doing the business degree. His name was on it. Mum and dad paid for it. We say it was a family effort.” In the end he started a plumbing business with Clarke. He was especially close to his sister, meaning she was one of the first to notice signs of his decline. “Certainly in the last two years there was a massive change in his personality,” she says. “Manic and addictive behaviours, things that had never been there before.” One of those was gambling. Macpherson would bet big sums of money. At its worst, he put down $100,000 in one hit. “It was random and it was massive, massive amounts of money,” Mcleod says. “He’d never had a gambling problem throughout his whole life but he would bet on almost anything and hide it. And his drinking, he definitely hid that.” The secret was out when Clarke discovered an influx of alcohol-related expenses on his company credit cards. “At one stage he was also abusing dexamphetamine,” she says. “He took up to 100 at one point in a day. I think he was just so desperate.” There were more subtle shifts, too. He would pop in to family events but leave soon after he arrived, or engage in a conversation physically while his brain was noticeably somewhere else. He’d ask Mcleod to catch up for a chat and clearly have something on his mind, but stop short of sharing it. On a Saturday night in 2020, about 12 months before he died, Macpherson went out to pick up some dinner and did not come home. His wife, Lana, had just gone into early labour with their twins and she couldn’t reach him. “We were calling and calling, and his friends were doing drive-bys of all the local pubs,” Clarke says. “We had enough reason given his manic behaviours. He was very fast-talking, on the ball, kind of almost like somebody who had taken too many drugs. Not aggressive, just in a very erratic, anxious state and being very secretive, covering his tracks. “The kinds of behaviour any addict would have, and I think that’s the thing with CTE – so much you can attribute to other things like addiction or mental health.” The following afternoon Clarke decided to try the business work yard. When she opened the door, the office had been turned upside down. The thing she noticed first were the bookcases, which were moved out from the wall and covered in illegible scribbles – an incoherent train of thought. “I could understand the first couple of words, and then it was made-up words,” she says. “I’ve seen movies where there are people who are just so out of their minds, and it was like that.” Paperwork was scattered everywhere. A tap was running water. On the wall was some blood. Or was it dirt? She couldn’t make out which. “And he had turned a chair upside down and put a sign on it saying ‘nobody is authorised past this point’,” she says. “I just remember looking at the sign and thinking, ‘what has he done?’ Everything drained out of me.” She phoned her dad and then an ambulance, but could not bring herself to venture any further until the police came. They found Macpherson in the adjoining mezzanine, alive but only just. He had left a note. Hospital staff found in his system – among other substances – such a high level of dexamphetamine that they initially assumed he was a meth addict. Clarke wants to share these upsetting details not for the sake of it, but to shock people into understanding the devastating outcomes of repeated brain injuries from collision-based sport. “I just want education,” she says. “I want people to be aware of it, and if Andrew’s story helps someone then his death is a little bit less of a waste. It is uncomfortable and it is horrifying, but I think people need to know the truth about it. It’s not a nice story, but it is his story. “We’re a really lovely family, and there are thousands of kids out there wearing Eagles jumpers and scarves and supporting other teams. Show Andrew’s photo to any mother who has a son doing the same things and they might consider that it could happen to them. This is a reality – CTE can happen to anyone.” After Macpherson’s suicide attempt, while an inpatient at the psychiatric hospital Graylands, doctors found it difficult to land on a diagnosis for any specific mental illness. He was prescribed antidepressants, but mostly took it upon himself to get better through regular meetings at Gamblers Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous. Sometimes his dad joined him for support, sometimes it was Mcleod. He tried other things, too. Clarke even drove him to a monastery to meditate with Buddhists. “He was trying so hard to be who he used to be, which was impossible,” she says. “He said to me that, if and when he dies, to get his brain tested for CTE. It wouldn’t have been a consideration otherwise.” Macpherson’s father died a few months after he did, having been ill with mesothelioma. He took some comfort and closure in learning his son’s deterioration could be linked with something tangible. “I think to some degree he held on wanting to find out,” says Clarke. “The second we found out it changed our mindset. It’s devastating, obviously, to know that he had struggled with it, but we were no longer blaming each other or ourselves. “Because obviously you are looking for answers with suicide. Could we have done something different? Did we not notice something? You know, what was our role in all of it? To find out that CTE was the reason was a comfort – there was nothing we could have done differently. “CTE robbed his brain and then robbed him from us. It’s just a complete injustice, you know? He was such a beautiful human. He was 33 – he was just a baby.” Clarke has since spoken with other affected families, including Shane Tuck’s wife Renee and Danny Frawley’s wife Anita, who discussed the declines of their own loved ones with CTE. It was the first time she found something she didn’t know she needed. His friends, too, have directed their grief towards a cause. Last September, on AFL grand final day, Mcleod, Bongiascia and Selby Lee-Steere staged the inaugural Mackie Cup, a charity football match contested by former AFL and WAFL players including premiership Eagles midfielder Chris Masten, Tyson Goldsack and Sharrod Wellingham. It raised more than $55,000 for the Kai Eardley Foundation, which runs workshops to prevent youth suicide in Australian men. The tradition will continue this year. In the interim, from time to time, Macpherson lets his family know he is still there. “It’s funny, the day he died it rained and rained and rained, and it felt like mother nature was mourning,” Clarke says. “The rain came again the day my dad died, and again on Andrew’s birthday. “I suppose we look for the signs, and he put on a good show. He rained for us.”",Sport/Sport,‘He was just a baby’: CTE robbed footy player of his brain and then his life | Emma Kemp,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/17/he-was-just-a-baby-cte-robbed-footy-player-of-his-brain-and-then-his-life
3/17/2022,"According to prime minister Scott Morrison, two years ago the message he was giving the public on climate change was that “we need to get emissions down”. In a morning TV interview with Nine News political editor, Chris Uhlmann, Morrison accepted Australia was now a harder place to live because of the climate crisis, and tried to suggest his priority had always been getting emissions down. “I said this a couple of years ago,” Morrison said. “I said we need to get emissions down, and we’ve got it down by more than 20 %. Canada can’t say that. New Zealand can’t say that. United States can’t say that. Japan can’t say that. But we can.” But does Australia really look good against those other countries? Before we get into this, what those countries also can’t say is that they’re among the world’s biggest exporters of both coal and gas; that their government has marketed a “gas-fired recovery” from a global pandemic; or that they have a leader who once held aloft a lump of coal in parliament and told everyone not to be scared of it. Before last year’s UN climate talks in Glasgow, one thing all of those countries did do was improve their emissions targets. Australia refused, and is still stuck with the same Abbott-era target to cut emissions by 26% by 2030 based on 2005 levels (Canada’s target is now 40% and the US’s is 50%). But back to Morrison’s list. When it comes to communicating its emissions, the government has to be very selective for it to make a favourable comparison with those countries. The United Nations official record of emissions from countries that have signed the climate change convention (that is, pretty much every country on the planet) has figures up to and including 2019. But the government has previously told the ABC’s Fact Check unit that to make the 20% claim, it has been using more recent quarterly figures that cover a period when emissions slowed around the world from the coronavirus pandemic. That means we can’t compare these more recent year-to-date Australian figures to those of other countries. But we can still do a useful comparison based on the latest submissions to the UN. First, the essential caveat because UN emissions data comes in two forms. One includes the impacts of changes to vegetation on emissions (such as forests being cleared or regrowing), and the other doesn’t. Australia uses the data that includes forestry because, as historical land clearing since European invasion has slowed, this has seen emissions in this sector fall steeply. Using this data does put Australia out ahead of those other countries with a reduction of 15% compared with the next best country in Morrison’s list, the United States, with 13%. But changes in land cover are influenced by state governments. Federal policy has practically no influence. And given that Morrison was speaking in the context of what federal government policy has done, we should be looking at emissions without the effect of land clearing included. If we do that, between 2005 and 2019 Canada’s emissions have fallen 1.1%, Japan’s 12% and the US’s 11.65%. New Zealand’s emissions are almost the same (82.4m tonnes of CO2e in 2005 compared with 82.3mt in 2019). Australia’s went up by 4%. So in this context, Australia is the worst performing country on Morrison’s list, not the best. Talking of targets, one columnist appeared confused about how they are set. In the Australian, that newspaper’s former editor Chris Mitchell criticised one ABC presenter for failing to point out that “Australia is ahead of most of the world on its 2030 Paris emissions reduction targets …” Perhaps someone should point out to Mitchell that countries set their own targets under the UN’s climate convention, and that Australia’s progress to those targets is an artefact of a lack of ambition at the time they were set (seven years ago) rather than any sign of stellar performance. Despite signing a pledge at the Glasgow climate talks that all countries should “revisit and strengthen” targets before the next talks later this year in Egypt, the Morrison government had barely landed back in Australia before it said it would ignore that promise. Instead, Morrison government ministers have quoted projections which they say will see the country cut emissions by 35% by 2030. But one leading analyst has told this column even if Australia did achieve cuts at that level, it would still fall short of its commitment under the Paris agreement. Talking of comparing Australia with other countries, another columnist in the Australian, Chris Kenny, ridiculed any suggestions this country should be phasing out fossil fuels to lower the risk from extreme weather events. “We could lead the way, abandon fossil fuels, and then just hope we are followed by China, India, Indonesia, Russia, America, Canada, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Nigeria, Kuwait, Iraq, Papua New Guinea, Brunei, Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates. You never know.” All those countries are signatories to the UN climate convention, which agreed in Glasgow last year to phase down coal power. Australia, Canada and the United States have already agreed not to finance unabated coal plants overseas through their membership of the OECD. China has also made the same pledge. Kenny also ridiculed the notion that climate change could have an impact on both floods and droughts. “The blaming of floods on global warming makes more sense than the finger pointing about droughts, given anyone with a basic understanding of climate science understands a warmer planet is a wetter one,” he wrote. Prof Steve Sherwood, a climate scientist at the University of New South Wales, explained to Temperature Check this was an oversimplification, but at least there was an acknowledgement that global warming was real and having some effect. “This is all related to the greater water holding capacity of a warmer atmosphere,” he said. “We expect heavier rains but also longer gaps between rains, rainier rainy years – like this one – and drier dry years.”",News/Environment,Is Australia really beating other countries at cutting emissions? | Graham Readfearn,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/17/is-australia-really-beating-other-countries-at-cutting-emissions
