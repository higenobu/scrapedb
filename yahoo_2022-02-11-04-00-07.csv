2/11/2022,"Trump's ex-communications chief said he's ""terrified"" of Maggie Haberman's upcoming book. Axios reported that the book contains new details about Trump's habit of flushing documents down the toilet. ""This is the first big anecdote, but there is quite a bit more to come,"" Alyssa Farah said Thursday. Former President Donald Trump's former communications director said Thursday that Trump is ""terrified"" of a forthcoming book by New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman. Alyssa Farah made the comment during an appearance on ABC's ""The View."" It came after Axios obtained an excerpt of Haberman's book saying that Trump's aides believed he routinely clogged a White House toilet by flushing wads of paper down it. Haberman's book also reportedly says that Trump has told people he is still in touch with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ""I still talk to some folks in Trumpworld, the ones who have not engaged in criminality,"" Farah said Thursday. ""The former president is terrified of Maggie Haberman's book. This is the first big anecdote, but there is quite a bit more to come."" Joy Behar, a co-host on ""The View,"" asked Farah if Trump was equally apprehensive about ""Peril"" by The Washington Post's Bob Woodward and Robert Costa. But Farah said Haberman's book is the one Trump is most nervous about given her years of experience covering him at both The Times and at The New York Post. ""She's covered him for decades, I'm very interested to see what else"" is coming, Farah added. A spokesperson for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Axios reported that the former president sat down for an interview with Haberman as she was writing her book, ""Confidence Man,"" which is scheduled for release in early October. According to Axios, Trump's aides were not pleased with his decision to talk to her — as he's done with other reporters who later published unflattering books about his presidency — but realized he couldn't help himself and they couldn't stop him. Haberman broke many of the defining stories of the Trump presidency while working as a White House correspondent at The Times. She frequently spoke to him by phone and despite his public attacks on her, Trump is said to have closely followed her coverage of him and his administration. Before arriving at The Times, Haberman spent 14 years working in New York tabloids and covering City Hall. ""In the context of covering City Hall, you would often end up dealing with Trump,"" she said in a 2018 interview for a four-part documentary about The Times. ""Trump was a quote who you would always try to get because he would always juice up a story."" When Trump dove into the 2016 presidential campaign, Haberman said she specifically asked her bosses at The Times if she could cover him. After Trump ascended to the Oval Office, Haberman told her colleagues that the president was ""fascinated"" and ""obsessed"" with The Times. She added: ""Even though he was born rich, he doesn't see himself that way, and he sees himself as, sort of, this guy who made it big and he plopped himself down into the middle of Fifth Avenue, and he still wasn't treated seriously ... and now he's in, sort of, the biggest piece of real estate in the country, and he is still not being treated seriously."" ""But he is always going to care enormously about what The Times writes, regardless of what Steve Bannon and whomever else is saying,"" Haberman continued. ""And it just plays a different role in his psyche.""

 Investigators from the House select committee probing the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol have found gaps in the White House phone records on the day of the insurrection, reports The New York Times. Investigators were unable to find the logs of calls by former President Trump during hours on that day when they know he was sometimes on the phone. There is no evidence that official logs were changed or deleted, the Times reports, and Trump often used his personal phone or those of aides for calls. At least one call directed to Trump on the day of the Capitol riot was picked up by an aide. Trump is known to have spoken to GOP Sens. Mike Lee (Utah) and Tommy Tuberville (Ala.), but the call was not present in the official records shared with the investigative committee, according to the Times. The House select committee has been given access to various documents by the National Archives including presidential diaries, schedules, activity records and call records to Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence from the day of the insurrection. Trump initially attempted to stop this move, but his efforts were overturned in a recent Supreme Court decision. The investigators reportedly have yet to receive the personal call records of people including Eric Trump and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is engaged to Donald Trump Jr., after subpoenaing their telecommunications companies. The panel is also waiting to receive more records from the National Archives and Records Administration, which is in charge of official White House phone records. Trump was watching the Capitol riot on cable news while it occurred, but the full extent of his activities is unknown. A spokesman for the House select committee declined to comment on the findings.",Politics/The Hill,Investigators find gaps in White House phone records from Jan. 6: report,https://news.yahoo.com/investigators-gaps-white-house-phone-170323216.html
2/11/2022,"By Michel Rose PARIS (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin spent much of his marathon talks with France's Emmanuel Macron this week on the Ukraine crisis reciting grievances that date back to the end of the Cold War, two sources in the French leader's entourage said. In the first detailed read-out on Monday's meeting in Moscow from the French delegation, the sources said Macron had been struck by how different Putin was to the man he had met in his summer residence on the French Riviera three years ago. ""(Putin) gave him five hours of historical revisionism,"" said one of the two sources, describing how the Kremlin leader laid out his belief that the West had broken commitments to Russia since 1997 with the enlargement of NATO to include former Soviet bloc states. ""So he goes on for hours rewriting history from 1997 on. He drowns you in these long monologues. And the president (Macron) kept on going back to the issues of the day,"" said the source. The French comments came as Russia, which has massed more than 100,000 troops near its borders with Ukraine, held military exercises https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/wrapup-1-russia-starts-belarus-military-drills-amid-new-diplomacy-ukraine-2022-02-10 in neighbouring Belarus and the Black Sea and Western leaders renewed their warnings of a major conflict. ""These more than five hours of talks make us realise how different the Putin of today was to the Putin of three years ago,"" said the source, who was briefed on the contents of the Macron-Putin talks and spoke on condition of anonymity. A Kremlin spokesman did not respond to questions submitted by Reuters about the French assessment of Putin's state of mind. 'TOTAL DISREGARD' Putin himself has spoken of growing frustration at what he calls Western failures to heed Russia's security concerns. ""You know, we have tried to talk to them about avoiding certain actions for 30 years now. What we get in response is total disregard for our concerns,"" the Russian leader said at a joint news conference with Macron on Monday. Putin's own actions make clear he has become more hawkish, including his crackdown on domestic opponents, the pressure on independent journalists, and now the massive military deployment near Ukraine. But the Macron meeting marked a rare opportunity for a Western leader to spend an extended period of time in Putin's company and to gauge, eyeball-to-eyeball, his state of mind. For the duration of their talks, the French leader, was alone with Putin, with no aides and only one interpreter. Macron had travelled to Russia to try to calm tensions between Russia and Western states over Ukraine. Washington has said the Kremlin is preparing for an invasion of its smaller neighbour, though Moscow denies such plans. According to the first French source, Putin returned repeatedly during the talks to the issue of the 1997 NATO agreement that paved the way for three ex-Soviet bloc states - Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic - to join the alliance. Putin, the sources said, described the agreement as a betrayal of earlier promises from the alliance not to expand. NATO members deny any such promises were ever made. Putin also dwelled on the 2014 Maidan Revolution - which saw the flight of a pro-Russian leader amid mass street protests - and on the 2019 election of Volodymyr Zelenskiy as Ukraine's president. ""He says it was a coup and that Zelenskiy is controlled by the United States,"" the first source said. The election of Zelenskiy, who replaced a similarly Western-leaning president, was described by monitors from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) as fair and held with respect for fundamental freedoms. After Monday's talks, Macron told his team that when he had hosted Putin in France in 2019, the Kremlin leader had seemed ""less tough and less focused on history"" than this time round, according to a second source. It was not immediately clear what this evolution in Putin's state of mind might spell for Ukraine. Macron told reporters as he flew out of Moscow he believed there was a real prospect for stopping escalation, though he said it was too early to point to any concrete undertakings from Russia to step back, and there were still real risks that armed conflict could break out.
