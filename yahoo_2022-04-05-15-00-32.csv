4/5/2022,"By Megan Davies and Alexandra Alper NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States stopped the Russian government on Monday from paying holders of its sovereign debt more than $600 million from reserves held at American banks, in a move meant to ratchet up pressure on Moscow and eat into its holdings of U.S. dollars. Under sanctions put in place after Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, foreign currency reserves held by the Russian central bank at U.S. financial institutions were frozen. But the Treasury Department had been allowing the Russian government to use those funds to make coupon payments on dollar-denominated sovereign debt on a case-by-case basis. On Monday, as the largest of the payments came due, including a $552.4 million principal payment on a maturing bond, the U.S. government decided to cut off Moscow's access to the frozen funds, according to a U.S. Treasury spokesperson. An $84 million coupon payment was also due on Monday on a 2042 sovereign dollar bond. The move was meant to force Moscow to make the difficult decision of whether it would use dollars that it has access to for payments on its debt or for other purposes, including supporting its war effort, the spokesperson said. Russia faces a historic default if it chooses to not do so. ""Russia must choose between draining remaining valuable dollar reserves or new revenue coming in, or default,"" the spokesperson said. JPMorgan Chase & Co, which had been processing payments as a correspondent bank so far, was stopped by the Treasury, a source familiar with the matter said. The correspondent bank processes the coupon payments from Russia, sending them to the payment agent to distribute to overseas bondholders. The country has a 30-day grace period to make the payment, the source said. DEFAULT WORRIES The increased pressure comes as the United States and Europe are planning new sanctions this week to punish Moscow over civilian killings in Ukraine. Russia calls its move in Ukraine a ""special military operation"". Ukraine and the West say the invasion was illegal and unjustified. Searing images of a mass grave and the bound bodies of people shot at close range drew an international outcry on Monday. Russia, which has a total of 15 international bonds outstanding with a face value of around $40 billion, has managed to avoid defaulting on its international debt so far despite unprecedented Western sanctions. But the task is getting harder. Russia was last allowed to make a $447 million coupon payment on a 2030 sovereign dollar bond, due last Thursday, at least the fifth such payment since the war began. If Russia fails to make any of its upcoming bond payments within their pre-defined timeframes, or pays in roubles where dollars, euros or another currency is specified, it will constitute a default. While Russia is not able to access international borrowing markets due to the West's sanctions, a default would prohibit it from accessing those markets until creditors are fully repaid and any legal cases stemming from the default are settled.

4/5/2022,"A quick look at the charts shows just how volatile this year has been for markets. It looks something like a carpenter’s saw, with a jagged-toothed pattern, trending down and then back up. The key to the pattern is, volatility has increased this year. Uncertainty is rising, and it’s getting more and more difficult to predict where the stock market will go. What the retail investor needs is a clear signal, some sign writ large and easy-to-read, to point the way forward. We can start with the insiders. These are corporate officers, whose positions put them in place to know what’s going on behind the scenes with their companies . This is vital knowledge, that investors can use to inform their own trading. The Insiders’ Hot Stocks tool, from TipRanks, makes the patterns of insider buying easily accessible. Combine that with some of the other frequently used signals – the consensus view of Wall Street’s analysts, the average upside potential, and you can quickly locate the stocks that have a clear bullish story. So let’s get started. We’ve pulled up the details on two stocks that show a combination of strong insider buying and plenty of love from Wall Street. DoubleVerify Holdings (DV) If there’s one thing that the corona pandemic crisis proved, it’s the ongoing need for digital security. DoubleVerify has known that for a decade or more – the company specializes in creating trust in digital advertising through a combination of fraud identification and brand reputation building. The company was a pioneer in digital ad verification, and today provides a wide range of media authentication services for customers in a variety of businesses, including financial services, telecom, retail, automotive, travel, and pharmaceuticals. While DoubleVerify has been in business since 2008, it only went public last year. The company held an IPO in April of 2021, a successful launch of more than 13.33 million share into the public domain. The initial price rage was expected at $24 to $27; the stock opened at $35, and closed its first day at $36. DV raised approximately $360 million in new capital through the IPO. In the past few years, DoubleVerify has taken frequent steps to boost its footprint through smart acquisition and partnership moves. In October of 2018, DoubleVerify announced a partnership with Twitter, for the authentication of video ads. That partnership was expanded in August of last year, when DV teamed up with the Twitter company MoPub to provide fraud detection, protection, and reporting. MoPub handles ad requests between advertisers and more than 1.5 billion addressable users worldwide. Following that, in September of last year, DoubleVerify partnered with TikTok to measure viewability and invalid traffic. DV will offer advertisers on TikTok a range of services, including data validation and campaign optimization. And on the heels of the coup, DV in November 2021 completed an agreement to acquire the contextual targeting platform OpenSlate in a cash and stock transaction valued at nearly $150 million. All of this has had a predictable impact on DV’s financial results. In 4Q21, the most recent reported, the company showed $105.5 million at the top line, a company record and up 35% year-over-year. DV has reported 4 quarterly results since its IPO, and showed sequential revenue gains in the last three of them. For the full year, DV reported a 36% y/y gain in revenue, to reach $332.7 million. On the insider front, DV's CEO Mark Zagorski made the most recent ‘informative buy.’ He picked up over 19,800 shares, paying over $508K for them. Covering DV for JMP Securities, analyst Andrew Boone is also bullish. He writes: “With difficult comps across digital advertising and macro risks growing, we believe DoubleVerify has a highly defensible business as it charges based on impressions (not on ad spend or pricing) and has multiple near-term catalysts ahead as TikTok continues to ramp, Twitter comes online in 1H22, and it cross-sells OpenSlate across its 1K+ advertiser partners."" ""This as we believe its opportunity is underestimated (without including its ability to offer performance-enhancing products like Authentic Attention and Custom Contextual) as 61% of its 176 client wins in 2021 were greenfield while 58% of the top 700 advertisers do not work with DoubleVerify at year-end,"" the analyst added. To this end, Boone puts an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on DoubleVerify’s shares. His price target of $41 implies an upside of ~54% for the year ahead. (To watch Boone’s track record, click here) Overall, the 8 recent analyst reviews on this stock break down to 6 Buys and 2 Holds, for a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating. DV shares are priced at $26.55 and the $33.75 average price target suggests ~27% one-year upside potential from that level. (See DV stock forecast on TipRanks) LCI Industries (LCII) Next up, LCI Industries, is a major name in the RV niche. This is another niche that greatly benefited from the COVID crisis, as people went looking for recreational activities that would work in tandem with smaller groups and social distancing. RVing, getting to the outdoors in a self-contained unit, fit the bill, and LCI Industries has seen its revenues grow steadily since bottoming out in the second quarter of 2020. The company earned those revenues through the manufacture of RV’s and accessories. On its own, and through its subsidiaries, LCI Industries offers RV steel chassis and components, as well as the interior fittings for beds, kitchens, seating, lighting – if it goes in an RV, this company can produce it. LCII also has its hands in the light truck accessory, utility, and trailer line; the recreational marine niche; and even in the passenger railway industry. By the numbers, LCII sees approximately $4.47 billion in annual sales, and has generated a 22% 5-year revenue CAGR. Earnings have also grown fast, at 16% annual CAGR over the past 5 years. The $1.2 billion that LCII reported in 4Q21 was a company record, and up a robust 55% year-over-year. Diluted EPS came in at $3.22, for 69% y/y growth. This solid performance backs up the company’s common share dividend, which was declared in February at 90 cents and paid on March 25. With an annualized rate of $3.60, the dividend yields 3.3%. This company’s insiders have not been shy recently about picking up shares. In the last few days, there have been two million-dollar buys from corporate officers. First, Jason Lippert, President and CEO, spend just over $1 million to buy 9,265 shares. And second, James Gero of the Board of Directors, spend $1.055 million to buy 10,000 shares. Company officers are not the only bulls here. 5-star analyst Michael Swartz, from Truist, sees this firm in a solid position going forward, writing: “We believe that LCII offers limited earnings downside risk from here given the favorable pricing/cost dynamic that should hold for the better part of 2022, more diversified business mix (~50% of sales from motorized RV, marine, aftermarket and other industries), potential content/mix benefit from the unfolding trade-up dynamic discussed above, organic share gains stemming from supply chain disruption, improving aftermarket profitability and the annualized contribution from acquisitions completed during 2021 (+$320mm in consolidated sales)."" ""Based on our updated RV industry shipment estimates for 2022/2023 (+1%/-10%), we believe LCII can AT LEAST maintain 2022 sales levels into 2023,” Swartz summed up. These comments support Swartz’s Buy rating on the stock, and his $165 price target indicates potential for 52% upside going forward. (To watch Swartz’s track record, click here) While this industrial company has slipped under the radar somewhat, and only picked up 3 analyst reviews recently, they all agree that the stock is a Buy, for a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $108.54 and their $160.67 average price target implies a 48% one-year upside potential.

4/5/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Cyclical shares tied to the U.S. economy’s health including banks, homebuilders and transports are struggling against the broader stock market, a telltale sign that investors remain hesitant to pour money into riskier corners of the market, according to BTIG, a U.S. brokerage firm. Most Read from Bloomberg A 30-Year-Old Crypto Billionaire Wants to Give His Fortune Away Elon Musk Takes 9.2% Stake in Twitter After Hinting at Shake-Up Ukraine Update: Zelenskiy to Address UN Body; Signal from China China Finds New Virus Subtype as Daily Cases Exceed 13,000 U.S. Switchblade Drones for Ukraine Will Include Tank Killers The S&P 500 Index has rebounded 8% since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. But sectors perceived as safer such as utilities and real estate have outperformed their cyclical counterparts this year, raising questions about the durability of the benchmark index’s latest rally as investors remain concerned about the trajectory of the global economy. In a note to clients called “Trouble Brewing Under The Hood,” BTIG said it maintains a cautious view broadly on U.S. equities. “The late March rally broke the market’s downside momentum, but hasn’t thus far done enough to reverse it,” Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at BTIG, told clients. “The magnitude and velocity caused many bulls to declare the low is in, and while that could certainly be the case, when we look under the surface, the market is giving a pretty cautious message.” The recent rally in utilities and REITs has occurred alongside a surge in Treasury yields. Last week, a key part of the yield curve inverted, with the U.S. two-year yield exceeding the 10-year for the first time since 2019. That has triggered worries of an eventual recession. Investors who are hungry for yield tend to pour money into utilities and real estate in times of uncertainty because they typically pay higher dividends and have steady cash flow. Banks, however, have struggled during yield curve inversions since it can hinder their net interest margins since they’d be borrowing money at higher rates. Read: Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says ‘Bear Market Rally’ Is Now Over In addition, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, which has climbed 4% in the past month, is testing support against the S&P 500 and is threatening to turn in a downtrend, Krinsky pointed out. Chip stocks, used in several hot areas of growth from data centers to artificial intelligence, were swept up in this year’s tech rout amid concerns over rising interest rates and supply shortages, but they have showed signs of demand recently. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index has shed 14% in 2022. To be sure, strategists at JPMorgan Chase & Co. think growth concerns are overblown and have called for more upside to stocks. BTIG’s cautious view on equities comes as Morgan Stanley said the recent rebound in the stock market will prove short-lived.

4/5/2022,"PARIS (Reuters) -Airbus has revoked the contract for a third A350 ordered by Qatar Airways after the Gulf carrier rejected delivery in an ongoing dispute over damage to the surface of the long-haul jets, two people familiar with the matter said. The number of A350s grounded by the airline in the dispute over exposed and damaged lightning protection has reached 23, bringing the value of compensation sought by the carrier to slightly over $1 billion, they said. Neither company had any immediate comment. The two sides have wrangled for more than a year over accelerated surface damage that the airline says raises questions over the safety of the planes, with Qatar's regulator grounding jets as the problem appears. Airbus, backed by its own regulator, has denied any safety problems and responded to Qatar's refusal to take any more A350s until the problem is resolved by revoking deals for undelivered A350s, one by one, and axing a separate contract for A321neos. Qatar will on Thursday ask a UK judge to extend a temporary order freezing the decision to cancel the A321neo order pending a final hearing on the A350 case, expected later this year. Bloomberg News reported earlier that Airbus planned to delay a planned increase in A350 production because of the combined impact of the Ukraine war and the Qatar dispute.
