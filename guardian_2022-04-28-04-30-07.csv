4/28/2022,"My brother, Michael Baker, who has died aged 71 after a long illness, was one of the most popular and influential figures on the Welsh drama scene. He played a significant role in shaping the Welsh theatre landscape into what it is today. Born in Stamford, Lincolnshire, Michael was the eldest of three children of Mary (nee Bishop), a primary school head, and Wing Cdr Maurice Baker, who after leaving the RAF became a teacher. From Abingdon school in Oxfordshire, where he was a boarder, Michael went to what is now Cardiff University to study philosophy, politics and economics. In 1972 Michael and his lifelong friend Mike Pearson formed the renowned Rat theatre, for which he directed and performed. Rat (Ritual and Tribal) theatre productions became standardbearers for a radical, energetic, sparse and frighteningly cruel theatre that often left its performers bruised, cut and bloodied, and its audiences in various levels of “catharsis”. Over the next few years the company toured Europe to great acclaim. At what is now the University of South Wales Michael undertook teacher training, and he went on to be head of drama at Radyr comprehensive school, Cardiff. In 1981 he got married, and shortly afterwards his only child, Tomos, was born. The marriage would later end in divorce. Michael became a drama officer at the Welsh Arts Council, and eventually drama director and then director of art form development up until the early 2000s. Bright and knowledgable, Michael was a great communicator and negotiator. He learned Welsh and became a friend and mentor to many artists and theatre-makers during his career. He was instrumental in the Arts Council’s drive for theatre in Wales to be recognised internationally, and was a key figure in the formation and funding of the two national theatres of Wales, working in English and Welsh respectively. Later, while living in Mold, Flintshire, Michael formed an arts consultancy, Michael Baker Associates, working on projects in Wales and abroad. In 2009 Michael was diagnosed with dementia. In 1987 he met Cheryl Nance, and they married in 2002. She survives him, as do Tomos, his sister, Elizabeth, and me.",Arts/Stage,Michael Baker obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/27/michael-baker-obituary
4/28/2022,"Spoiler alert: this article is for people watching Moon Knight on Disney+. Do not read unless you have seen episodes one to five. After the headscratcher of episode four – was it a dream, a trick played by Harrow or Ammit, or was it all in Marc’s head? – we needed some answers. And we got them, sort of, albeit slowly. To my mind, the opening recap heavily suggested this was all a ploy by Ammit, or agents acting on her behalf, going so far as to hint that the Ennead are also involved (I still think they are, even though there was no more evidence to support that). The first five minutes of the episode proper didn’t clear things up any further, with two stories being told simultaneously: the part that was seemingly in Marc’s mind, featuring Steven and Tawaret, and the other, in Harrow’s office, in which the doctor told Marc that he’d been picking fights in the psychiatric hospital and talking about a rhinoceros. It wasn’t until Tawaret welcomed Marc and Steven to the Duat, the Egyptian underworld, that things began to clear up a little. As the Duat is incomprehensible to the human mind, people tend to muster surroundings that are familiar to them before passing through to Aaru, or the Field of Reeds, the heavenly paradise ruled by Osiris. At this point, Marc had come to believe he genuinely was a patient in the hospital, while Steven was faced with the revelation that he, too, was unwell. Of course, in life as in death (or the MCU) two things can be true at the same time, and just because you are dead, and have dissociative identity disorder, doesn’t mean that Harrow is a doctor and that the talking Egyptian deity in front of you is all in your head. And so to getting their hearts weighed on the scales of justice, just as Harrow had done for the people in the Alpine town square. As Marc and Steven’s hearts were unbalanced, they were instructed to go back into the hospital construct and revisit their memories to show each other the truth. We saw Moon Knight in the museum toilet, we saw Mr Knight and Khonshu turning back the stars and then, in the third window, we saw someone I was convinced was going to be Jake Lockley. For the non-comic readers among us, or those reading who don’t spend time trawling the internet for clues, Lockley is, in the comics at least, a second Marc Spector alter ego after Steven Grant. He’s a New York taxi driver, prone to more severe violence than the other two personalities. It would have made perfect sense – given the rooftop killings neither Spector nor Grant seemed to remember, Layla’s dad’s previously unexplained death, and that third sarcophagus in the hospital last week. The scene in question here looked like New York and there was a taxi in the background. But it was not to be (the truth, when it finally came, was far more devastating). Perhaps Lockley is Moon Knight’s version of Nightmare or Mephisto, the character the internet has decided it wants to see, but that is nowhere to be found. Nevertheless, we moved on, to a room full of people killed by Marc, the scales slowing down as Steven learned a lot more about who Marc – and, by extension, he – is. “Why is there a little boy in a room full of people you’ve killed?” came Steven’s most pertinent question. As he followed the boy through the door, he was taken back to childhood, where we learned Marc had a brother. They wandered through the fields, reciting lines from Tomb Buster as Rosser and Dr Grant, and it quickly became apparent what had happened. Marc’s brother drowned, and their mother blamed him. We saw the yelling and the uncelebrated birthdays and, eventually, Marc leaving to join the military. Fast forward to Egypt, and the truth of Layla’s dad’s death. Marc – now a mercenary being discharged after going into a fugue state – was working for Bushman, who ordered him to raid a tomb and leave no survivors. “I couldn’t live with that. I tried to get them all away, but we didn’t make it. Clearly.” It sounds so simple, explained that way, and believable. Couldn’t he have told Layla that last week when the subject came up? Then we came to the really heartbreaking moment, when Steven finally learned the truth about himself: that he was an invention of Marc’s all along, nothing but a shield from his mother’s beatings. “You’re not meant to see that; that’s the whole point of you,” said Marc, dragging him away from the memory. “The point of me? What, to be your stress ball?” replied Steven. “All this time I thought I was the original, but I’m just something that you made up.” And so to the big reveal of why Marc – and definitely not Jake – was standing on that street, sipping from a hip flask. He was watching his mother’s shiva through the window of his former family home. We finished up with Steven, realising that if Marc can fight, he can, too, and fending off a couple of undead on board Tawaret’s boat. He was thrown overboard in the tussle, destined to reside for eternity in Duat, while Marc, with his scales now balanced, on his way to the Field of Reeds where, hopefully, he will realise what kind of game Harrow is playing, find Layla and free Khonshu before being reunited with his Moon Knight powers. We’ve now had two episodes without our costumed hero and his beaky god, save for flashback scenes, and it would be churlish to complain, given the quality of this episode and episode four. But the series is called Moon Knight, and I want to see him throwing more moon-shaped ninja stars (ninja crescents?) around before the credits roll on episode six. Something tells me I’m going to be satisfied this time next week, but I have been wrong before. Let’s hear it for Oscar Isaac’s performances. He’s never been less than great in this series, but this was a standout. As Marc and Steven he had several huge moments of emotion to deliver and nailed each one. I often wince when actors are essentially talking to themselves on screen – Gollum/Sméagol’s two-way dialogue notwithstanding – but this was a masterclass. Tawaret mentioned the Ancestral Plane, which we were first introduced to in Captain America: Civil War, when T’Challa described the Wakandan perception of death to Natasha Romanoff. We saw the plane for the first time in Black Panther. Putnam psychiatric hospital features in the Moon Knight comics as the facility Elias Spector has his son sent to for treatment. While not explicitly stated, I believe it served the same function here on screen, mustered by Marc as he has been there many times before. Rey Lucas, who played Elias Spector here, can be seen in two episodes of Luke Cage playing Det Tomas Ciancio, partner of one Misty Knight. I loved the Ned Flanders jibe at Harrow’s moustache. Confirmation, if it were ever needed, that people in the MCU watch The Simpsons. I wonder if they get discounted Disney+ subscriptions? If Marc and Steven’s mum is dead, who was he leaving all those voicemails for? A mailbox Marc set up? The song playing as Marc gazed on Arau was called Mas Allá Del Sol, which means “somewhere over the sun”. What did you think? Perfectly poised for the finale, or a distraction? Are you missing Moon Knight and Khonshu?

4/28/2022,"Off the west coast of Sicily lies the remains of the ancient city of Motya. There, a compound of temples and shrines offers a window into the life of Phoenicians settlers who journeyed from Lebanon across the Mediterranean in the first millennium BC. While it has been studied for a century, the site is still giving up new secrets. Earlier this month a rectangular basin, long-believed to have served as an artificial harbour for protecting naval ships and participating in trade, was revealed to be something else entirely – a religious site, designed and constructed to perfectly align with the stars. The basin, larger than an Olympic-sized swimming pool, was rebuilt in 550 BC along with Motya after it was destroyed in an attack by Carthage, another Phoenician colony from across the sea. The city was then abandoned in Roman times. Since the pool’s discovery in the 1920s, it was thought to be a “kothon” – an artificial military harbour. Kothon are “quite a common thing” in the Mediterranean, Ania Kotarba, senior lecturer in archeology at Flinders University, says. The most famous is in Carthage. But recent excavations and decades of research led by archaeologist Lorenzo Nigro of Sapienza University of Rome and published in the journal Antiquity this month unearthed clues suggesting the pool is instead the heart of a sprawling religious site. “Sacred pools are less common [than kothon],” Kotarba said. “So one on such a scale is quite impressive.” Since his team’s research, perceptions of the basin have “drastically changed,” Nigro said in a statement. What was thought to be a harbour for centuries may soon be interpreted as “a sacred pool at the centre of one of the largest cultic complexes of the pre-Classical Mediterranean”. Reinvestigation of the basin began 12 years ago, when remains of a temple to the god Ba’al were discovered where excavators expected to find harbour buildings. Ba’al – a widely used Semitic word meaning “lord” – has often been likened to the Greek god Orion, believed to exist as a constellation among the stars. Kotarba says Ba’al was associated with the god of storms in the Phoenician period. As Phoenicians’ were known to be seafarers, traders and explorers, their deities were associated with celestial bodies. “Their livelihoods were connected to celestial movements around the sky,” she says. “Storms are the greatest adversary to seafarers, and the god of storms could interrupt their safe passages.” “So it is not unexpected that their key sanctuary would be dedicated to Ba’al, and have something to do with astronomy working out movement of celestial bodies,” Kotarba says. A 10ft statue of Ba’al once stood at the pool’s centre. Its torso was discovered in the 1930s in a nearby lagoon, and stone blocks used for its feet were found by the pool’s edge. Quoting Leonardo Divinci, Nigro said; “the only good mirror in antiquity is water” “It became clear the function of the basin was to be a pool for watching the stars, reflecting them like a mirror,” Nigro said. His research found the water’s reflection was used as a tool to map movement of the stars for navigation – something crucial to Phoenicians, who Kotarba calls “the greatest navigators of the Mediterranean and beyond”. Upon mapping the site, the research team also found the configuration of Motya itself aligned with the heavens. Key features line up with constellations – the temple of Ba’al aligns with the rise of Orion’s constellation at the winter solstice. Recent excavations also found several more temples bordering the pool, alongside inscribed stone columns, altars and offerings. And critically, unlike harbours, the pool is not connected to the open sea. Draining of the kothon for excavation began in 2005. So, when one morning Nigro arrived to find a small pond of “beautiful transparent water” in the basin, he “could not understand how it was possible”. It was not until 2019 that excavation revealed channels carrying water to the pool from three natural springs. Thousands of years on, the Phoenician engineering of fresh water to the basin continues to work. Nigro calls discovery of the Phoenician’s “pre-scientific tool” a “piece of human-kind in the past”. “We can not use our science to understand this past science,” Nigro told the Guardian. “But it can teach us there exists a diversity in science. There could be solutions in it for us.” “The Phoenicians colonised, built up cultures and civilisations. They built roads and crossed seas, but they never destroyed their environment.” “We are the only civilisation destroying the environment,” he says. “We should ask, are we the ones who have more science, or them?”",News/World news,Rewriting history: Phoenician ‘harbour’ revealed to be religious site that aligns with the stars,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/27/rewriting-history-phoenician-harbour-revealed-to-be-religious-site-that-aligns-with-the-stars
4/28/2022,"There are penalty kicks and then there are Statement Penalty Kicks. Even the best players approach this trial from 12 yards with a binary sense of dread. Relief or disaster: these are the only sensible outcomes. Except, of course, when there’s a third option, the penalty that becomes an act of stagecraft. Who could forget Andrea Pirlo pulling the plug on Joe Hart in Kyiv in 2012 with the most impossibly light, fluffy, airy Panenka, a penalty kick that took Hart gently by the elbow and said, do sit down, the grownups are talking. Or David Luiz smashing the ball into the stanchion with Chelsea trailing in the 2012 Champions League final shootout, a moment of such fearless, ringlet-tossing abandon it changed the weather completely: actually, we’re coming after you. Tuesday night brought another one. Karim Benzema really did need to score from the spot at the Etihad Stadium. Two goals down with eight minutes to play, Real Madrid were clinging on to this semi-final by the standards of normal, everyday football teams. At which point Benzema produced – well, what exactly? An impudent dink. A regal loft. An imperial tickle. A moment to steal a little hope from your soul. Madrid had been brittle in defence and slow in central midfield, with Toni Kroos creaking about the pitch like a fond old Victorian rocking horse. Benzema’s dink told the world they still considered themselves to be winning this tie. Mainly because – read the badge – they’re called Real Madrid. But also because they have Benzema, 13 years into his career at a club that doesn’t generally do 13-year careers; and right now the outstanding single presence in elite European club football. The talk now will be about the Ballon d’Or, because football tends towards individual glory. But also because it’s so obvious that Benzema should win it. He is on a run of 17 goals in 12 games. He has 46 in 48 for the season, 13 assists and another league title in the barrel, all the while reeling off outrageous displays of will and edge at the sharp end of things. The Ballon d’Or is awarded in October. There isn’t time for anyone else to approach this level. If convicted attempted blackmail go-betweens are allowed to win the big awards – and before we clutch our pearls too closely this is a sport whose global body has anointed Vladimir Putin as a force for world peace – then it looks like a wrap. But it is also far from the most interesting thing about Benzema, whose performance on Tuesday night captured so much about Real Madrid, and about Manchester City too. Mainly it was just about Benzema. Micah Richards drew some flack last month for announcing during TV duties that Madrid’s No 9, the top scorer in La Liga, centrepiece of a title-winning team might finally be approaching the levels of Harry Kane. It would be unfair to take this single remark out of context and portray Richards as the embodiment of a laughably solipsistic Anglo-centred sporting worldview. Although perhaps not that unfair. Benzema is 34. This has been going on for some time now. Aged 17 he told a room full of senior internationals at Lyon to stop laughing at his initiation speech as he was there to take their jobs. Four years later, still at Lyon, he was being shortlisted for the Ballon d’Or. He’s lining up his fifth Champions League medal on the back of 85 Champions League goals. Kane, who is also a brilliant footballer, has been playing in the Europa Conference League. It does take a genuine loss of scale to conclude this is any kind of contest at all right now. Plus, you just need to watch Benzema play. The first thing that stands out is his movement. Nothing is wasted. Everything has a purpose. When he runs the hairs prickle on your arms, because he’s telling you the game is about to change, that things are happening. The most notable part of his first goal against City was the casual finish, the ball tucked into the corner with the ease of a man crossing his legs on the sofa. The other part was the run to get there. There was no run. Benzema was already there, waiting for the game to catch up. Overall he had 43 touches, two shots on target and a sense of overbearing presence. There is a lot of talk about the age of top strikers now, backed by stuff about diet and conditioning. Another big part of this is mentality. Elite football is a suffocating thing. It comes at you in an endless scroll of data, angles, equations. It takes a certain maturity just to block and sift that information, to process the right parts. Age helps. Faced with this terrifying spotlight, this agony of options, Benzema addresses the ball like a man stroking the family pet. The only real surprise was that he didn’t score a hat-trick. How many will he get in the Bernabéu? It is a key question in this tie. Benzema has 17 of Madrid’s past 28 goals. This is a champion team in the process of coming apart, with a rebuild to be funded by the usual combination of hope, loans and stadium income. For now Madrid are in a glorious state of ripeness, like a majestically aged blue cheese. At the head of this the man who was kept out of the team by Emmanuel Adebayor, who was seen by some in Madrid as an overweight underachiever, has found his final form as the keeper of that golden thread, embodiment of Madrid-ism, of the idea of victory as divine right. This was the other thing Benzema’s performance spoke to. How, exactly, do you make a champion team? High-end process or high-end pragmatism? In many ways Benzema is the perfect argument for signing Erling Haaland (or Kane), and simply bolting on that same elite attacking edge. Pep Guardiola has built his success on other principles, on obsessing over the ball not the man. On the other hand Madrid’s individualists have won four finals during the decade Pep has spent falling just short. One thing is clear. Benzema at the Bernabéu already looks like the single most vital factor in deciding which of these teams get to play out another in Paris.",Sport/Football,"As embodiment of Madrid-ism, Karim Benzema can still drag Real to Paris final | Barney Ronay",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/27/karim-benzema-real-madrid-manchester-city-champions-league
4/28/2022,"The career of an England Test captain, like a life in politics, always seems to end in failure. Maybe it’s at a tearful press conference after back-to-back thrashings by South Africa. Or by a hastily arranged England Cricket Board statement sent out after a row that also cost the head coach his job. Or off the back of an almighty spat with your star batsman that started when he was caught sending texts to the opposition slating your leadership. Or at the fag end of a slump of form in which the team lost five series in a row. In the end the job seems to break everyone who takes it on. Experience tells you that whoever takes over next – and it looks as if it will be Ben Stokes – will end up in a similar place. Sooner or later, the captaincy becomes a study in watching a good man get ground down. The question is what he and his team can achieve along the way. It makes you wonder what it is about leading England in particular that seems to take so much out of a cricketer (and why, as Derek Underwood once asked, “so many players want to be captain anyway”). Doug Insole, who led Essex in the 1950s and did a stretch as Peter May’s deputy when England toured South Africa in 1956-57, said a captain needs to be “a public relations officer, agricultural consultant, psychiatrist, accountant, nursemaid, and diplomat”, as well as a player, selector and tactician. It tells you plenty about how stiff the job is that Joe Root ended up in the position he did even though he seemed to do so well in so many of those different roles. He had the batting. Unlike Mike Brearley, Root always demanded a place in the team, since he was the best batsman in the country; unlike Michael Vaughan, he was able to maintain the best part of his form while he was leading it, even if his batting average did drop a few points. And he had the man‑management. Unlike Andrew Strauss, Root always seemed to have the support of all of his players, who never had a bad word to say about him (in Afrikaans or any other language). But Brearley, Vaughan and Strauss will be remembered as three of the best captains England had. Unlike Root. Root never ended up on the front pages of the papers after being accused of having a tryst with a barmaid in his hotel room during a Test, never squared off with an umpire in the middle of a match because he didn’t agree with his decision, never got caught rubbing dirt on the ball, never called a foreign journalist a buffoon in a press conference, never turned up for practice so hungover that his coach made him sit out the session because he thought he was still drunk (if that last one seems like a low bar, it is still one that one of his predecessors failed to get over). Root didn’t look at his team and say: “My God, look what they’ve sent me,” which is what Archie MacLaren came out with when the selectors announced his side to play Australia at Old Trafford. And he never greeted one of his debutants with: “Gracious me! Don’t tell me you’re playing!” as Johnny Douglas is supposed to have done. He was never run out by one of his own teammates because they were so fed up with him, like Geoff Boycott, never provoked one of the most pitiless attacks ever put together by promising to make them “grovel”, like Tony Greig. What Root didn’t have was that touch of the mystic that may just be the most venerated quality of all. “Captaincy,” said Richie Benaud, “is the ability to think ahead of play, not be left responding to it.” Root didn’t have a feel for bowling changes or field placings. Although, since everyone in the game has got an opinion on how to do the job, you don’t have to look far to find good judges who will tell you that side of it is overrated anyway. “‘A dynamic bowling change’ you write about is probably sheer luck nine times out of 10,” said Graham Gooch when he was captain. “OK, you bring on someone and he gets a wicket – great, but I haven’t solved the mysteries of the universe have I?” There are myriad ways to fail, so many that even when you’re winning, there will be plenty who think you’re going about it in the wrong way (as Strauss found out). It feels as if the England captain isn’t just leading the 10 other players on the field, but the entirety of English cricket. Perhaps the last man who really managed it was May, who Wisden described as “the beau ideal of English sportsmanship”. However, even he fell out with the press when he brought his fiancee on tour. May finished with the captaincy when he was 31. After he quit, Wisden waited nine years before publishing a tribute to him because everyone was hoping he would make a comeback. There’s a lesson there for Stokes when the time comes: it’s best to quit while you’re ahead if you can. They’ll remember you better for it.",Sport/Sport,Memo to Ben Stokes: take the captaincy – but get out while the going is good | Andy Bull,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/27/ben-stokes-england-captain-cricket
4/28/2022,"A senior Ukrainian tennis official has told his sport’s governing bodies that they will be “playing on the side of the monster” if they go against Wimbledon and the LTA for banning Russian and Belarusian players from this summer’s events. Evgeniy Zukin, the vice-president of Ukraine’s tennis federation, also contrasted the WTA’s strong comments during the Peng Shuai case with its response to Russia as he warned that tennis risked “being on the wrong side of history”. Zukin said invading Russian forces had destroyed Ukraine’s national tennis centre in Irpin, near Kyiv, and that there were still unexploded bombs on the courts. But he stressed that such destruction was nothing compared with the daily horrors and deaths since the invasion, as he backed Wimbledon and the LTA’s stance. “Of course they have made the right decision, and I’m really surprised that the ATP, WTA and a lot of the tennis community don’t understand that. It is accepted that we apply economic sanctions on the nation which started this war, unprovoked with hundreds of war crimes, even though not every Russian is for it. And in sport it cannot be business as usual either. “If the ATP and WTA share in the values of a free world, of independence and sovereignty, they need to do something in order to stop the monster. Otherwise they will be playing on the side of the monster.” Those critical of the decision to ban Russians have included Martina Navratilova and Novak Djokovic, while the WTA and the ATP have accused Wimbledon and the LTA of discrimination. However, Zukin said it was a legitimate response given how much Putin’s regime has used sport as a propaganda tool. “Tennis keeps telling itself it is not responsible. But as long as it allows Russians to play, even without a flag, they are promoting the country,” he said. “And if a Russian won Wimbledon or Queens or whatever, would he be put forward by the Russian government as another show of dominance? I don’t have any doubts about this. Because politics and sport in Russia are absolutely mixed. “When Putin met Russia’s sports stars at the Kremlin on Tuesday he told them: ‘You are on the frontline of our fight for our values.’ So we can’t close our eyes. “I love watching Daniil Medvedev and Andrey Rublev play. But when you think about the women and children who are suffering, and experiencing things that you could just imagine in your worst nightmares, it is wrong to allow Russians to play on the professional tour and promote their system. It is just not the time.” The WTA and ATP are expected to hold meetings at the Madrid Open this week as they decide on their next steps. The tours could theoretically opt for the radical response of withholding ranking points for this year’s Wimbledon. However, Zukin said that any sanctions would put tennis on the wrong side of history just months after it made the decision to withdraw from China after Peng Shuai’s disappearance. “There’s an absolute contradiction between Peng Shuai and what is happening with Russia,” he said. “For WTA it was hard to pull out of China, but it was the right thing to do. However, what Russia is doing is even more obvious, but they are focusing more on putting sanctions on Wimbledon and the LTA, who are doing the right thing. This just blows my mind.” Zukin said that while Ukraine’s national tennis centre had been destroyed, he was thankful that none of the staff had been killed. “On some photographs you can see tank tracks. And there are still bombs on the tennis courts which did not explode. And all the houses around there are severely damaged. “But thankfully all our employees are safe, as we closed down on 24 February. We didn’t try to save anything and we sent all the people home. The centre is all destroyed but doesn’t matter – because our people aren’t hurt.”",Sport/Sport,‘Stop the monster’: Ukrainian tennis chief backs Wimbledon ban on Russians,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/27/stop-the-monster-ukrainian-tennis-chief-backs-wimbledon-ban-on-russians
4/28/2022,"Prince Andrew has suffered another indignity after councillors in York unanimously voted to remove his honorary freedom of the city. An extraordinary meeting of York city council on Wednesday also heard councillors call on Andrew to relinquish his Duke of York title in the wake of his now settled sexual assault civil case. The freedom of York was granted to Andrew in 1987, essentially a wedding gift after his marriage the previous year to Sarah Ferguson. At the time there was a huge, joyful civic ceremony, which attracted crowds of more than 200,000 people. Thirty-five years later it has been ignominiously removed after a meeting at York racecourse which lasted barely 25 minutes. Darryl Smalley, the Liberal Democrat councillor who proposed the motion, said he was pleased to have won the support of councillors from all parties on the council. “The honorary freedom of York is the highest honour we, as a city, can bestow on those who represent the very best of York,” Smalley said. “The honour is held by many notable and accomplished people who carry it with pride and responsibly. “Having been stripped of his military roles and royal patronages by the Queen, we believe that it is right to remove all links that Prince Andrew still has with our great city. “The removal of this honorary title sends the right message that we as a city stand with victims of abuse. The next logical step is now for Prince Andrew to do the right thing and relinquish his Duke of York title. If he fails to do so, the government and Buckingham Palace must step in to remove his title to finally end Prince Andrew’s connection to York.” Aisling Musson, a Labour councillor, said the council owed it to the people of York, “particularly those who have been affected by sexual violence, abuse or human trafficking. Our first duty is not to our reputation but to their wellbeing and protection.” Apart from two abstentions from the lord mayor and the lord mayor elect, all councillors at the meeting voted for Andrew to be stripped of the title. Martin Rowley, a Conservative councillor, called for reassurance that in the future “nobody receives a freedom of the city award as a result of right of birth, or standing in the community”. Andrew’s freedom of York had been almost forgotten about until a former council official tipped off the Guardian, which prompted York city council staff to search the archives and in turn led to Wednesday’s extraordinary meeting. In February it was announced that the prince had settled his case with Virginia Giuffre who had claimed she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein to have sex with Andrew when she was 17, a claim the prince has denied. The out-of-court settlement meant that Andrew made no admission of guilt. International lawyers said that the financial cost to Andrew was likely to be more than $10m (£7m) even before he paid his own legal bill, which is expected to run into millions. The cost to his reputation has been huge. In February it was announced the Queen was stripping Andrew of his military affiliations and royal patronages. He also can no longer use the HRH royal style in any official capacity. He remains, however, the Duke of York – much to the chagrin of many in the city. Rachael Maskell, the MP for York Central, has said it was “untenable for the Duke of York to cling on to his title another day longer”. A poll for the city’s newspaper, the Press, showed that 88% of people agreed. An act of parliament would be needed for Andrew to be stripped of being the Duke of York, a title given to him by his mother in 1986 when he married Ferguson. Buckingham Palace and a spokesperson for the Duke of York declined to comment.",News/UK news,Prince Andrew loses freedom of York after councillors’ vote,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/27/prince-andrew-stripped-of-freedom-of-york-by-councillors
4/28/2022,"The head of the influential and secretive consulting firm McKinsey & Company has denied the company illegally hid work for Purdue Pharma, the drug-maker that kickstarted the opioid epidemic, while also advising for the Food and Drug Administration. But Bob Sternfels, McKinsey’s global managing partner, apologised for the company’s work with Purdue, manufacturer of the powerful painkiller OxyContin that initially drove an epidemic that has claimed more than one million lives over the past two decades. Sternfels testified to a congressional committee on Wednesday after it released a report revealing how McKinsey’s work for Purdue, including how to “turbocharge” opioid sales even after the drug manufacturer was convicted of federal crimes for illegally pushing OxyContin, was hidden from the FDA. The report said that over a period of 15 years “at least 22 McKinsey consultants, including senior partners, worked for both FDA and opioid manufacturers on related topics, including at the same time”. The FDA has said that it did not know until last year that McKinsey was simultaneously working for Purdue. The consulting firm was paid $86m by the drug-maker and $140m by the FDA. The chair of the House oversight committee, Carolyn Maloney, told Sternfeld that McKinsey’s conduct was “among the worst I have seen in my years in government”. “At the same time the FDA was relying on McKinsey’s advice to ensure drug safety and protect American lives, the firm was also being paid by the very companies fueling the deadly opioid epidemic to help them avoid tougher regulation of these dangerous drugs,” she said. Maloney said that McKinsey designed strategies for Purdue and other companies to drive up opioid painkiller sales, paving the way for the explosion of addiction and overdoses. “Some of the advice McKenzie provided is absolutely shocking beyond belief,” she said. At one point a McKinsey consultant advised the opioid maker to head off tighter regulation of its drug with a legal claim “alleging FDA impropriety”. The same consultant was later assigned to work with the FDA office responsible for overseeing that regulation. Another senior McKinsey consultant “worked on three FDA projects from 2014 to 2018 to assess the safety of dangerous drugs through the FDA Sentinel Initiative while simultaneously advising Purdue”. The committee said that a McKinsey partner who frequently consulted for the FDA also worked with Purdue to prepare for an FDA meeting about one of its opioids. “In 2016, a McKinsey partner encouraged other consultants to share information with Purdue about ongoing drug safety work McKinsey was doing for FDA, saying they should ‘talk about our work w FDA, specifically sentinel which I think would be v useful for them in opioids’,” the report said. Maloney suggested McKinsey had broken the law in not disclosing its work for the drug-makers to the federal authorities. Sternfels said his firm was merely protecting client confidentiality. He denied there was a conflict of interest because he said McKinsey was advising the FDA on “implementing technology solutions” and performance management not drug regulation. He said that McKinsey was therefore not obliged to tell the FDA of its work advising Purdue about how to influence the FDA’s regulation of opioids. But Sternfels acknowledged that McKinsey should not have advised Purdue to increase OxyContin sales. “We fully recognise that it fell short of our standards,” he said. “While our intent was not to fuel an epidemic, in any of our work, I think we failed to recognise the broader context of what was going on in society around us.” Sternfel’s apology did little to satisfy some members of the committee. Representative Rashida Tlaib said she regarded McKinsey’s consultants as “drug traffickers in suits”. Representative Ayanna Pressley accused the firm of being complicit along with Purdue and its owners until recently, members of the Sackler family, in creating the opioid epidemic. The Massachusetts attorney general, Maura Healey, also testified as to discoveries made by her office investigating McKinsey’s work for Purdue and the Sackler family. “We learned that McKinsey consultants worked directly with the Sackler billionaires who controlled Purdue. We found that McKinsey told the Sacklers to target the most dangerous prescribers who put the patients on opioids at the most highest levels and at the highest doses for the longest periods of time,” she told the hearing. “We found that McKinsey did not want the world to know what it was doing. But when I sued the Sacklers, McKinsey consultants read about my investigation and lawsuit and actually planned to delete their documents and emails. They wrote that they were going to destroy the evidence because ‘someone might turn to us’.” Healey’s investigation resulted in McKinsey agreeing last year to pay nearly $600m to settle claims by 49 states, Washington DC and five territories that its advice to Purdue and other opioid manufacturers drove the US’s worst drug epidemic. Purdue Pharma, which is in bankruptcy, pleaded guilty to bribery, fraud and other criminal charges in 2007 and 2020 over its drive to sell OxyContin, including false claims for the drug’s safety. Members of the Sackler family who owned Purdue have agreed to pay $6bn to settle claims by US states, municipalities and individuals without admitting liability.",News/US news,McKinsey denies illegally hiding work for Purdue Pharma while also consulting for FDA,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/27/mckinsey-denies-illegally-hiding-work-purdue-pharma-fda-opioids
4/28/2022,"Rishi Sunak has opened the door to a windfall tax on oil and gas companies despite previously dismissing the policy, as Labour accused the government of burying its head in the sand over spiralling bills. The chancellor hinted at a possible U-turn on a tax on oil and gas providers, having repeatedly refused to countenance the idea in the past when suggested by Labour and the Liberal Democrats. It comes as Keir Starmer branded Boris Johnson the “Comical Ali of the cost of living crisis”, suggesting the government was in denial about the financial pressures facing households and bereft of new ideas. Speaking to Mumsnet, Sunak said he had not gone down the road of a windfall tax because he did not want to put off investment in new oil and gas extraction, highlighting a recent £25bn investment by one company in the North Sea. But he added: “What I would say is that if we don’t see that type of investment coming forward and companies are not going to make those investments in our country and energy security, then of course that’s something I would look at and nothing is ever off the table in these things.” Hours earlier, Dominic Raab had dismissed the idea of a windfall tax as “disastrous” and “damaging”, while Boris Johnson rejected it at Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions as a “tax on business”. However, the Tories are coming under intense pressure over their lack of ideas on how to deal with inflation running at more than 7% and energy bills soaring even higher. Johnson held a brainstorming cabinet meeting on Tuesday where ministers suggested relaxing rules on how many children can be cared for by nursery staff and allowing less frequent MOTs to help people save money. But the ideas were criticised as inadequate by Labour, while Torsten Bell, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said the government had “lost the plot” if it thought its ideas would make a substantial difference to people’s lives. “Our problem is a big cost rise for almost everyone that is harder for low/middle-income households to bear. So the answer is either reducing that cost rise for, or raising the income of, those households. The benefits system is by far the easiest way to do that. Obviously,” he said. Starmer made the comparison between Johnson and Comical Ali – the former Iraqi minister who gained cult status for his outrageous lies – during a fractious prime minister’s questions, with Starmer saying Johnson was complacent about people’s “blindingly obvious” economic problems. The Labour leader said a mooted plan to let motorists get MOTs lasting two years instead of one made the ill-fated 1990s “cones hotline” look “visionary and inspirational”. He said Johnson was “only just waking up to the cost of living crisis” and had acted like an ostrich. Johnson accused Starmer of “droning on” and dismissed his call for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies to help bring down people’s energy bills, saying: “This guy is doomed to be a permanent spectator.” In their final public pitches before next week’s local elections, the two leaders traded blows during a session that was focused mainly on the economy. Starmer said the UK was on course to have the slowest growth and highest inflation in the G7, and he said Johnson was failing to properly manage the economy. In a series of targeted questions designed to pin responsibility for the cost of living crisis on the government, Starmer said ministers were making life worse for working people with last month’s “tax-hiking budget” and by failing to help those whose fuel bills have spiralled. “They’re the party of excess profits, we’re the party of working people,” Starmer said. He said his party would ask oil and gas companies to pay their fair share, insulate homes to get bills down and close tax avoidance schemes by scrapping non-dom status. Johnson dismissed the windfall tax on offshore energy companies, saying it would “clobber the very businesses that we need to invest in energy to bring the prices down for people across this country.” Spending in the North Sea is set to hit £21bn over the next five years, according to a report issued in September 2021 by UK oil trade body Offshore Energies UK, indicating a higher annual rate than the £3.7bn of investment reached in 2020. Shell is considering a U-turn on a plan that would have seen it abandon the Cambo oilfield in UK waters, after it became emboldened by the improving political, regulatory and economic picture. It reconsidered after a bumper 2021, thanks to higher oil and gas prices that sent profits soaring to $19.3bn, compared with $4.85bn the year before. The company said this month it planned to invest £20bn-£25bn in the UK energy system over the next decade, although 75% will be on offshore wind, hydrogen and electric vehicle infrastructure, rather than North Sea oilfields. BP’s boss, Bernard Looney, declared the company a “cash machine” after profits swung to $12.8bn, compared to a loss of $5.7bn the year before. “We plan to continue to invest in the North Sea,” BP said in its latest annual report. Sunak hinted at more help for people on energy bills in the autumn, but claimed it would be “silly” to support households now. “We’ll see what happens with the price cap in the autumn, I know people are anxious about this and wondering if they’re going to go up even more,” he said. “Depending on what happens to bills then, of course, if we need to act and provide support for people we will, I’ve always said that. But it would be silly to do that now.” The comments drew criticism from Labour. Tulip Siddiq, a shadow Treasury minister, said the chancellor was “out of touch” as families were “already feeling the cost of living crisis, hit by record rises in energy prices, record high petrol prices and staggeringly steep hikes in the cost of food and essentials.”",News/Politics,Rishi Sunak hints at U-turn on UK oil and gas windfall tax,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/27/rishi-sunak-uk-oil-and-gas-windfall-tax
4/28/2022,"Donald Trump has revealed in sworn testimony that he hired Matthew Calamari, later a senior executive in the Trump Organization at the time an activist alleges he was roughed up by Trump’s security team, as a bodyguard after seeing him demonstrate “bravery” in a fight at a tennis competition. Trump discussed Calamari in a deposition for a civil lawsuit brought by Efrain Galicia, the activist who alleged the incident occurred while he was protesting outside Trump Tower in 2015. Calamari, who was later investigated in an unrelated tax fraud inquiry and who was hired as Trump’s bodyguard before climbing the ranks to an executive position, is not being sued personally but was deposed as he oversaw security in his corporate role at the time of the alleged assault. Trump, however, is named as a defendant. The lawsuit alleges that Trump, his business, his campaign and his security team “undertook these wrongful acts by common agreement”. He was ordered to provide the deposition in October of last year. Trump also said in the deposition that tomatoes could be lethal when thrown at people, in response to questions about his telling the audience at a rally in February 2016: “If you see someone getting ready to throw a tomato, just knock the crap out of them.” Galicia’s case is one of many legal challenges Trump faces. This week, he was held in contempt for failing to disclose documents in the ​​civil investigation by Letitia James, the New York state attorney general, into whether the Trump Organization misstated the values of its real estate properties to obtain favorable loans and tax deductions. The Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, has also insisted that his office’s investigation concerning Trump and the Trump Organization is proceeding, despite several high-profile resignations over inaction. In July 2021, the Trump Organization and its former chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg were charged for an alleged “sweeping and audacious illegal payment scheme”. CNN reported in November that Manhattan prosecutors did not intend to charge Calamari, at least for the time being, but Trump’s comments provide another glimpse into the former president’s unorthodox involvement in personnel matters. Trump said in his deposition that he had hired Calamari about 40 years ago after seeing him take down hecklers at a tennis match. “They had to stop the match because people up in the top of the stadium were screaming bad things,” Trump said. “And the other security guards weren’t doing anything about it. “And Matt went up and the whole stadium was watching. And he spoke to the people, but they were screaming and they were really out of line,” Trump continued. “And I guess they made the first move. But they went after him. And he went after them. And whatever had happened, he ended up on top. “And the stadium was impressed because it was a certain brave, you know, there was a certain bravery there,” Trump said. “It wasn’t a big fight. It was not a real big fight. It was just, you know, he got them – and he got them to either calm down or I think he took them out. I think he took them out of the stadium.” Trump also said that he was responsible for promoting Calamari from security to corporate management and had “authority” over his compensation. Galicia’s lawyers also asked Trump about his statement to attendees to “knock the crap out of” anyone getting ready to throw a tomato at the 2016 rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. “It was very dangerous,” Trump said. “They were going to throw fruit. We were threatened, we had a threat.” He added: “It’s worse than tomato, it’s other things also. But tomato, when they start doing that stuff, it’s very dangerous. There was an alert out that day. “It was said sort of in jest,” he added of his tomato comment. “But maybe, you know, a little truth to it. It’s very dangerous stuff. You can get killed with those things.” Trump also described pineapples and bananas as “dangerous stuff”. Trump also defended Keith Schiller, his head of security at the time, for actions during the protest. Galicia alleges that Schiller punched him. “He did nothing wrong,” Trump said of Schiller.

4/28/2022,"Conservative councillors in Oliver Dowden’s constituency have been disciplined for a “hate” campaign against a Jewish Labour candidate, according to an independent investigation commissioned by Tory HQ. The report found the behaviour of five Hertsmere Tory councillors “may well have encouraged” antisemitic abuse of Labour’s Dan Ozarow, as well as multiple breaches of the party’s code of conduct. Campaigning tactics included a digital billboard at Elstree and Borehamwood station with a picture of Ozarow suggesting he was a supporter of Hezbollah, mocked up on a fictitious newspaper. CCHQ asked an independent QC to examine the behaviour of the councillors and the subsequent abuse of Ozarow on social media, where he was told to “go to the gas chambers” and that he “lacked a Jewish soul”. Ozarow described feeling “terrorised” by the abuse of him and his family, including an anonymous phone call that appeared to threaten his wife and unborn child. Hertfordshire police recorded several social media posts as “hate incidents”. Ozarow, who stood as a candidate in the Borehamwood Kenilworth ward byelection in 2020, told the investigation that the hate began after negative campaigning by the Conservative councillors. In his 104-page submission considered by CCHQ, he alleged that threatening messages were sent to his work email and he received a chilling anonymous message purported to be from a Conservative councillor warning that he “had to live with his past” and mentioning his and his wife’s unborn baby. The Conservatives’ co-chair Ben Elliot accepted the recommendations of a panel of party members led by the independent QC Richard Price, which found that the councillors Brett Rosehill – who won the byelection – Glenn Briski and Paul Morris were “party to a personal campaign against the claimant in relation to the 2020 byelection and which continued for many months”. It also concluded that “this negative campaigning may well have encouraged others to send antisemitic posts or messages to the complainant”. The report also criticised the council leader, Morris Bright, who it said should have “taken steps to rein in the activities of these councillors at an early stage”. The same criticism was made about a former councillor, Jane West, the Hertsmere election agent. All five have received formal reprimands. Ozarow, who won a byelection in the ward in 2021, said: “After this two-year investigation, I am delighted that the terror that my family and I went through is finally over and that the Conservative party has reached this verdict. I wanted to show people that I wasn’t going to be bullied away just for wanting to make my community a better place. “No one should have to suffer like my family and I did and it really saddened me to hear Jewish people from other parties telling me that they were too frightened to stand for election because of what happened.” The Conservative deputy leader of Elstree and Borehamwood town council, Sandra Parnell, also described Ozarow as “the worst antisemite”. She apologised after an out-of-court settlement.",News/Politics,Tory councillors disciplined for ‘hate’ directed at Jewish Labour candidate,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/27/dan-ozarow-tory-councillors-disciplined-campaign-jewish-labour-candidate
