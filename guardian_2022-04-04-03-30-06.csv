4/4/2022,"Prince Andrew is facing calls to explain why he received £1m in payments linked to a financier who is now facing allegations of fraud in the high court. In 2019, Andrew received £750,000 from Nebahat Isbilen, a Turkish millionaire and wife of a former leading politician, who has claimed in the high court that she was told by her financial adviser, Selman Turk, to pay the sum to the prince in return for assistance with a passport application. Andrew’s ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, and two daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie, have also been named in court documents for the case, in which Isbilen claims she was defrauded by Turk of up to £40m. Turk denies the allegations. Here is a timeline of events linked to the latest controversy to embroil the Duke of York: 2005 Andrew is reported to have met Tarek Kaituni, a Libyan national with a conviction for gun smuggling, who is said to have facilitated meetings between Andrew and former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. 2009 Beatrice is reported to have received a £20k diamond necklace from Kaituni for her 21st birthday, months before the duke allegedly lobbied a British company on his behalf. 2014 After being stripped of his role as trade envoy, Andrew launches Pitch@Palace, a Dragon’s Den-style project, in which budding entrepreneurs would be given the opportunity to woo successful business people with rapid-fire pitches. 12 October 2018 Eugenie marries brand ambassador Jack Brooksbank. Kaituni is said to have attended the wedding. May to June 2019 It is reported that Kaituni introduces Selman Turk to Andrew at a birthday celebration at Windsor Castle. July 2019 The Duchess of York is unveiled as an ambassador for Pegasus, for which she later receives payment via one of Turk’s companies, amounting to £225,000. October 2019 It is reported that two payments were made by Turk to Eugenie amounting to approximately £25,000. She denies knowing Turk or Isbilen. 6 November 2019 The annual Pitch@Palace event is held at St James’s Palace. Turk wins the people’s choice award, voted for by the audience, for his pitch for his company Heyman AI, a digital bank aimed at millennials. 14 November 2019 Andrew’s then-aide Amanda Thirsk has a conversation with Isbilen’s bank, in which Thirsk says a payment of £750k to be paid to Andrew relates to a wedding gift for Beatrice. The transcript is later published in the Daily Mail. 15 November 2019 A transfer of £750k is made from Isbilen’s account to Andrew’s personal Coutts account. She later says Turk told her it was in return for assistance with a passport application. 5 December 2019 Andrew allegedly visits Turk at his apartment in South Kensington, it is reported. February 2020 Turk and Kaituni are pictured at what is believed to be Frogmore House, a royal residence in Windsor Home Park. July 2020 Beatrice marries property developer Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi.

4/4/2022,"Women across Ukraine are grappling with the threat of rape as a weapon of war as growing evidence of sexual violence emerges from areas retaken from retreating Russian forces. The world was horrified on Sunday by a picture taken by the photographer Mikhail Palinchak on a highway 20km outside the capital, Kyiv, in which the body of one man and three women were piled under a blanket. The women were naked and their bodies had been partially burned, the photographer said. The harrowing image adds to a mounting body of evidence that summary executions, rape and torture have been used against civilians in areas under Russian control since the Kremlin launched the invasion of its neighbour on 24 February. Particularly difficult for many to comprehend is the scale of the sexual violence. As Russian troops have withdrawn from towns and suburbs around the capital in order to refocus the war effort on Ukraine’s east, women and girls have come forward to tell the police, media and human rights organisations of atrocities they have suffered at the hands of Russian soldiers. Gang-rapes, assaults taking place at gunpoint, and rapes committed in front of children are among the grim testimonies collected by investigators. “We have had several calls to our emergency hotline from women and girls seeking assistance, but in most cases it’s been impossible to help them physically. We haven’t been able to reach them because of the fighting,” said Kateryna Cherepakha, the president of La Strada Ukraine, a charity that supports survivors of trafficking, domestic violence and sexual assault. “Rape is an underreported crime and stigmatised issue even in peaceful times. I am worried that what we learn about is just going to be the tip of the iceberg.” Rape and sexual assault are considered war crimes and a breach of international humanitarian law, and both Ukraine’s prosecutor general and the international Criminal Court have said they will open investigations into reported sexual violence. But what currently seems like a far-off possibility of justice has done little to assuage Ukrainian women’s fears of what may yet happen in a war that is far from over. Antonina Medvedchuk, 31, said that when she woke up to the sound of bombing on the day the war broke out, the first thing she grabbed before leaving Kyiv were condoms and scissors to use as a weapon to protect herself. “Every break between curfew and bombing I was looking for emergency contraception instead of a basic first aid kit,” she said. “My mother tried to reassure me: ‘This is not a war like that, they don’t exist anymore, they are from old movies.’ I have been a feminist for eight years, and I cried in silence, because all wars are like this.” It is not only Russian soldiers Ukrainian women may have to protect themselves from. In Vinnytsia, a town in the west of the country, a teacher reported to police that a member of the territorial defence services dragged her into the school library and tried to rape her. The man was arrested. Feminist organisations such as La Strada Ukraine and a countrywide network called Feminist Workshop have been working online and with local government to distribute information about medical, legal and psychological support available for victims of sexual assault, and are trying to find safe shelters for women and girls fleeing both the war and domestic violence. They fear, however, that the trauma caused by the use of rape as a military tactic will lead to deep suffering across Ukrainian society for years to come. “When a woman gets away it looks like she’s safe, she’s far away from the guns and the man who raped her,” said Sasha Kantser, external affairs manager for the Lviv chapter of Feminist Workshop, which has helped hundreds of displaced women and girls since the war broke out. “But the trauma is a bomb inside her, that follows her. The scale of what is happening now is heartbreaking.”",News/World news,Rape as a weapon: huge scale of sexual violence endured in Ukraine emerges,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/03/all-wars-are-like-this-used-as-a-weapon-of-war-in-ukraine
4/4/2022,"David Warburton, a relatively unknown political figure outside his Somerton and Frome constituency, has been a backbencher for almost all of the seven years since he became a Conservative MP. But the married father of two was catapulted into the headlines when a picture emerged of him next to lines of white powder alleged to be cocaine and several women reported him to parliament’s harassment watchdog. He is said to have insisted he had “enormous amounts of defence”, though faces sitting as an independent MP after having the Conservative whip removed and has been urged by colleagues to stay away from the parliamentary estate. Warburton turned heads around Westminster when he lost six stone in less than a year, having previously been classed as obese. He said he had “got a bit obsessed” with using a home gym during the first Covid lockdown, and won plaudits from then health secretary Matt Hancock for his new-found fitness fanaticism. Multiple Tory MPs said that upon his return to Westminster, his reinvention seemed like a “mid-life crisis”. “I don’t think anyone would ever have mistaken him for Theresa May but this is a lot more than people would have predicted,” says one MP But when the allegations about his behaviour emerged, colleagues said they were shocked. They called him a “quiet one”, and those who had shared a drink with him on previous occasions said he had “seemed really nice”. “I don’t think anyone would ever have mistaken him for Theresa May but this is a lot more than people would have predicted,” one said. A neighbouring MP said he was a “very decent guy” and that in all their interactions with him, he had appeared “diligent and hard-working, not seedy or shifty”. “He does keep himself to himself, he’s clearly not here to climb the ministerial pole,” the MP added. Warburton was not a career politician. Born in Reading, he said he did shop work, cleaning, sandwich-selling and van driving. He went on to graduate from the Royal College of Music – where he received a prestigious scholarship – with a degree in music composition, before being accepted for a doctorate at King’s College London and winning awards such as the Elgar Memorial Prize. Warburton’s music was performed by ensembles including the Scottish Chamber Orchestra and the Royal Opera House. He also founded the Pulse youth orchestra and was a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. In his own youth, Warburton had been lead guitarist and a keyboard player in a succession of rock bands. And before becoming an MP, Warburton was a music teacher at a state school in London. In fact, his most prominent role in the Commons has been as a keen chair of the all-party parliamentary group on music. After moving on from music, he founded a business that allowed local independent retailers to offer their products online. He did hold two junior ministerial aide roles under May’s administration, serving as a parliamentary private secretary in the business and education departments in 2018. Because he was elected in 2015, Warburton was able to employ his wife as a communications officer and parliamentary assistant. Rules forbidding MPs from using taxpayers’ money to hire their spouses or other relatives as staff only came into effect from the following election. Warburton backed Boris Johnson in the 2019 Conservative leadership election, and voted for Brexit in the 2016 EU referendum.",News/Politics,David Warburton: the varied past of the MP facing sexual harassment claims,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/03/david-warburton-the-varied-past-of-the-mp-facing-sexual-harassment-claims
4/4/2022,"Tottenham needed to win this game and did so in a manner that suggests the battle for fourth place, or better, is nowhere near cut and dried. They enter the Champions League places, at least until Arsenal visit Crystal Palace on Monday night, and it was no mean feat that they contrived Newcastle’s biggest defeat of the season. A different outcome had looked likely when Fabian Schär put the visitors, who had looked the more competent for most of the first half, ahead but Ben Davies levelled quickly and Spurs blew Newcastle away after the break. Matt Doherty, Son Heung-min, Emerson Royal and the substitute Steven Bergwijn all scored superbly worked goals and, from appearing stodgy, Antonio Conte’s team offered a reminder that they are an exhilarating proposition when in full flow. Eddie Howe’s reign has generally been hallmarked by a clarity rarely associated with modern-day Newcastle. The trend continued early on: they were set up neither to defend in depth nor flood forward, but instead picked their moments to probe. They could point to the first sniff of a big chance in the 22nd minute, when Jonjo Shelvey’s optimistic drive ricocheted into the air and was brought down sublimely by Joe Willock, who had just about worked himself a clear shot when Cristian Romero sped in from nowhere. Spurs had been left lop-sided by an injury to Sergio Reguilón, which meant Doherty was obliged to continue his renaissance out of position on the left. It turned out that there would be no reason whatsoever to rue their wing-back rejig but the opening half-hour had little zip. Opportunities, such as they were, arrived infrequently. Rodrigo Bentancur’s sixth-minute curler was repelled by the head of Schär while Harry Kane, bringing a bobbling ball under his spell, briefly looked as if he might do better than rifle wide. Eric Dier curled a free-kick wide from the kind of position his centre-forward might have fancied, although this would quickly become a profitable day for defenders in such situations, and Martin Dubravka was only worked when Son twisted into a half-space and shot into his midriff. Newcastle’s initial incursions had been based on Alain Saint-Maximin’s eagerness to commit opponents but, having weathered what counted as Spurs’ opening storm, they found diverse ways to express themselves. Chris Wood saw a stooping header blocked shortly after Willock’s close call; that happened in the aftermath of a Matt Targett free-kick that had been clumsily conceded by Kane, who watched in relief as the ball fizzed across the goalmouth. It was quite the afternoon for gauche forwards’ challenges. Schär was able to size up his opportunity when Son mistimed a nibble at Willock two yards outside the area; he took just one step up to the ball but whipped it around the wall and into the corner via the hand of Hugo Lloris, who appeared to see it late and might have done better. Howe and Jason Tindall slapped hands; the goal survived a VAR check for a spurious suggestion of handball by Wood in the wall, and Newcastle deserved their lead by this point. They squandered it within four minutes. Perhaps Son was on a mission after his part in the opener: he won a corner after a 50-yard sprint up the left and then, after his first centre had been returned to him by Dier, swung a second attempt across. Davies was on hand to glance a smart header across Dubravka and, from mediocrity, the game had suddenly produced two goals. There was now enough life for a flashpoint before the interval, when Bentancur appeared to motion his head into that of Saint-Maximin; the two were booked, along with Joelinton, and there was a palpable edge as the teams disappeared down the tunnel. Spurs’ belatedly discovered sharpness had won them the game within nine minutes of re-emerging. They initially took control via a marvellous piece of skill from Kane, who showed strength to pull off from Newcastle’s central defenders in the middle before pulling out to the right, initially at what seemed a meander, and weighing up a deep cross. Saint-Maximin was back too late to close him down and his delivery was a dream: it just evaded Son, who dabbed out a leg, and bounced for Doherty to showcase his attacking instincts with a difficult, well-angled header past Dubravka. It was an excellent goal but Spurs, looking slick now spaces were opening up, soon topped it. A passing move from the back stepped up a gear when Dejan Kulusevski played a give and go with Kane, who floated the ball into his run down the right. The Swede’s cross was perfect and Son, controlling it right-footed before finishing with his left, converted it consummately. Conte leapt into a mass embrace with his staff; it seemed a crucial strike. Given the manner in which Spurs had started, the surprise was not inconsiderable. It went up several notches when Emerson, without a goal in a patchy first season here, found himself on the six-yard line when Doherty checked cleverly inside and crossed. Emerson lunged in and made just enough contact to squeeze Tottenham’s fourth inside the post. Wing-back to wing-back; it was Conte’s kind of goal. Son missed a clear chance to make it five but, just after Conte had returned the crowd’s acclaim, Bergwijn ran on to his fellow replacement Lucas Moura’s pass to finish well.

4/4/2022,"The world must abandon fossil fuels as a matter of urgency, rather than entrusting the future climate to untried “techno-fixes” such as sucking carbon out of the air, scientists and campaigners have urged, as governments wrangled over last-minute changes to a landmark scientific report. Talks on the final draft of the latest comprehensive assessment of climate science, from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), stretched hours past their deadline on Sunday. Scientists and governments were locked in disagreement on questions such as how much funding was likely to be needed for developing countries to tackle the climate crisis, and what emphasis to give policies such as phasing out fossil fuel subsidies. Governments have been accused of trying to water down the scientists’ findings, due to be published on Monday. The Guardian understands that India has demanded key changes on issues including finance, along with Saudi Arabia which wants to see affirmation of a continued role for fossil fuels, while other countries including China and Ecuador also held out on some points. Russia has played a more muted role than some feared. Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate the Tyndall Centre for climate research at the University of Manchester, one of the UK’s leading climate academics, called for the scientists to prevail. “I hope Working Group 3 [the IPCC section about to be published] has the courage to actually call for the elimination of fossil fuels production and use within a Paris [agreement] compliant timeline,” he said. This is the third part of the IPCC’s latest landmark assessment, and the most contentious because it covers the policies, technologies and finances needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The first part, covering the physical science of climate change, was published last August showing the world had only a narrow chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C; the second, published just over a month ago, showed the catastrophic impacts heating of 1.5C would have, but it was overshadowed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The report itself – hundreds of pages long and drawing on the work of thousands of scientists over the past eight years – is settled, but still in dispute is the crucial “summary for policymakers”, a selection of key messages running to only about 40 pages. While the report is drafted by scientists, the summary – which is the key reference document for governments – is edited with input from every UN member state that wishes to be represented. The latest warning from the IPCC – the final instalment of its mammoth comprehensive assessment, before a synthesis report in October draws together its key messages in time for governments meeting for the UN Cop27 climate summit in Egypt this November – comes at a crucial time. Many countries, including the US, the EU and the UK, are reconsidering their reliance on fossil fuels in light of the Ukraine war, which has pushed already high energy prices to record levels. Energy is now seen as a national security issue, and the crisis in the cost of living in many countries is forcing governments to rethink ways to protect their citizens, from high prices and climate breakdown. Rachel Kyte, the dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University in the US, said: “We are at a moment of increasing tension around the world, with every excuse possible for distraction and delay. We now have to put our arms round a new form of energy security, one that embraces everyone – a new kind of politics. We are at a moment of reckoning and the IPCC report just puts an exclamation point at the end of that.” Some governments are likely to stress the role the IPCC foresees for techniques that remove carbon from the air, such as carbon capture and storage, used to neutralise fossil fuel power stations, and technologies such as “direct air capture” by which carbon is chemically extracted from the atmosphere. The IPCC in its broader report is likely to warn that these techniques are unproven and likely to be prohibitively expensive to use quickly at the scale required, but governments may force more favourable language into the summary. Nikki Reisch, the director of the energy and climate programme at the Center for International Environmental Law, said governments should be clear: “There is no room for more oil and gas full stop. [Some businesses] want to perpetuate the myth that we can carry on using fossil fuels. But we need a just transition away from fossil fuels, not techno-fixes.” Anderson said this was a key dilemma. He warned the report could “pull its punches, hiding behind billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide removal … [If that is what emerges], then the academic community will have abdicated its responsibility and opted for realpolitik over real physics. The climate responds only to the second.” Stephen Cornelius, the head of delegation for WWF, defended the IPCC process against charges that governments could use it to water down scientific warnings. He said that as governments played a role in writing the summaries, they could not shirk responsibility for heeding the warnings they contain. “The IPCC is a useful process,” he said. “It is cumbersome, there is a long time between the outlines and the report, but … the reports have political buy-in, and that’s why they are taken seriously.”",News/Environment,Scientists urge end to fossil fuel use as landmark IPCC report readied,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/03/scientists-urge-end-to-fossil-fuel-use-as-landmark-ippc-report-readied
4/4/2022,"A Republican governor has blasted Donald Trump as “fucking crazy” and said if he was ever committed to a mental institution “he ain’t getting out”. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire delivered the remarks at Saturday’s Gridiron Club dinner in Washington DC, an event noted for its tradition of roasting politicians with satirical and often cutting comedy speeches. But the skit is unlikely to endear Sununu to the notoriously prickly one-term former US president, who once sat “red faced and huffy” under a similar barrage from Barack Obama at the White House correspondents’ dinner in 2011. Trump’s decision to run for president in 2016 was attributed by many as a desire to gain revenge over Obama for the humiliation he endured. Sununu’s comments were part of a broadside of humor directed at Trump, which included a recollection of traveling in a limousine together from a New Hampshire airport to a campaign rally. Trump, according to Sununu, was reveling in the presence of supporters waving flags along the route and proudly pointed one out. “I can’t help but notice the guy he pointed at, the sign he’s holding says, ‘Fuck Trump’,” Sununu joked to loud applause. Trump did not attend Saturday’s dinner and Sununu’s sustained onslaught was brutal. “You know, he’s probably going to be the next president. Nah, I’m just kidding, he’s fucking crazy,” Sununu said, according to Politico. “The press often will ask me if I think Donald Trump is crazy. And I’ll say it this way, I don’t think he’s so crazy that you could put him in a mental institution. But I think if he were in one, he ain’t getting out.” If Trump was the main target, several of his political allies also came under fire, including the Texas senator Ted Cruz, whom Sununu mocked for his appearance. “What is with Ted? You see that beard?” he said. “He looks like Mel Gibson after a DUI or something.” The My Pillow founder Mike Lindell, a Trump loyalist who has been quick to support the ex-president’s big lie that his 2020 election defeat was fraudulent, was also skewered. “This guy’s head is stuffed with more crap than his pillows. His stuff is crap. I mean, it’s absolute crap. You only find that kind of stuff in the Trump Hotel,” Sununu said. And Sununu advised Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary reportedly about to take a job with MSNBC, to seek her money upfront, in a jibe at the network’s ratings. Sununu wasn’t the only speaker taking shots at Trump. Joe Biden sent in a video that was played to attendees apologizing for his absence. “I really wanted to be with you tonight, but the truth is I just couldn’t find a seven hour and 37 minute gap in my schedule,” Biden said, a reference to the missing period of time in Trump’s White House communications log on 6 January last year while his supporters were ransacking the US Capitol.

4/4/2022,"Prince Andrew had known an alleged fraudster for at least six months before receiving more than £1m in disputed payments from the man, it has been reported. The Duke of York was introduced to Selman Turk via a mutual contact, Tarek Kaituni, a Libyan-born convicted gun smuggler, in May or June 2019 at Windsor Castle, and held subsequent meetings, the Sunday Telegraph reports. Turk received an award from Andrew at a Pitch@Palace event – a Dragons’ Den-style project for entrepreneurs created by the duke – in November 2019.

She alleges that Turk told her to make the payment to Andrew in return for assistance with a passport application. The prince, who has declined to comment on the reports, repaid the sum about 16 months after he received it, once Isbilen’s lawyers contacted him. It is through these legal proceedings that Andrew’s connection with Turk was revealed, including further payments of £350,000 received from Alphabet Capital, which lawyers have told the court was “a fraudulent and covert front” to make payments to those “associated” with Turk. Andrew’s reported introduction to Turk in May or June 2019 is another piece of the puzzle of the latest controversy to embroil him. It still remains unclear as to whether he was aware of the money entering his personal bank account or what it was for. His spokesperson declined to comment on the most recent reports. Kaituni is reported to have first introduced Andrew to Turk at a birthday celebration at Windsor Castle sometime between May and June in 2019. Turk and Kaituni subsequently met Andrew in London on at least two occasions, including at a dinner with potential investors at Turk’s apartment in South Kensington on 5 December 2019, the Telegraph said, citing sources. Turk later shared pictures of him and Kaituni inside what is believed to be Frogmore House, the royal residence in Windsor Great Park, during a visit in February 2020. The Guardian has been unable to verify the claims. Another court document, dated April 2021, says Turk disputes Isbilen’s allegations: “He disagrees with her portrayal of the facts, including as to her understanding of the various dealings with her assets. He states that much of what has happened is the result of Mrs Isbilen’s status as a politically exposed person and the consequential difficulty in dealing with her assets.” Andrew’s connections with Kaituni, whom he is said to have first met in 2005, have been widely reported. Kaituni, who was convicted of attempting to smuggle a submachine gun from Holland to France in 2005, is reported to have facilitated meetings between Andrew and the former Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi. He was reported to have given Andrew’s eldest daughter, Beatrice, an £18,000 gold and diamond necklace after the prince invited him to her 21st birthday party in Spain in August 2009, months before Andrew allegedly lobbied a British company on his behalf. Kaituni is also reported to have attended the wedding of Andrew’s youngest daughter, Eugenie, in 2018. It emerged on Saturday that one of the duke’s senior aides had told bankers that the £750,000 payment from Isbilen was for Beatrice’s wedding. The Daily Mail obtained a transcript of a phone call on 14 November 2019 between Andrew’s former aide Amanda Thirsk and bankers acting for Isbilen. In the call, the bankers queried the purpose of the £750,000 transfer from Isbilen’s account to the duke’s personal account at Coutts, and Thirsk, who was a senior member of the royal household at the time but no longer works there, said: “It’s a gift for the wedding, a wedding gift.” The duke’s ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, and Eugenie are also named in court documents related to Isbilen’s case against Turk. It is said Ferguson received £225,000 and Eugenie £25,000. Ferguson’s case is that she received the funds from Turk’s business after he took on a debt owed to her by Pegasus, a solar power company, which owed her payment for her role as ambassador for the firm. Her spokesperson said: “The duchess was completely unaware of the allegations that have since emerged against Mr Turk. She is naturally concerned by what has been alleged against him.” Eugenie told the Sunday Telegraph: “I know neither Mrs Isbilen nor Mr Turk.” ",News/UK news,More details emerge of Prince Andrew’s alleged links with banker Selman Turk,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/03/more-details-emerge-of-prince-andrews-alleged-links-with-banker-selman-turk
4/4/2022,"Once upon a time, while browsing the aisles of Los Angeles’ now dearly departed Samuel French Bookshop, a candy store for actors and writers, I came across an instructional CD. It claimed to assist the aspiring Oscar winner in mastering the Australian accent, which the CD had handily broken down into roughly a dozen different “Australian” archetypes (including, I am very sorry to say to those in Aotearoa, a single “New Zealand” accent). Having seen many try, and fail, to nail an Aussie accent on film, I gathered that it was up there with the trickiest accents an American or British actor might attempt – like 19th century Irish (RIP Tom Cruise) or whatever pan-London accent Don Cheadle was offering in Ocean’s Eleven. What, I wondered, were the cornerstones of its teachings? Learning to sing the real lyrics of Am I Ever Gonna See Your Face Again? Ordering a pie and sauce at the milk bar? As the Victorian College of the Arts’ head of voice and movement, Leith McPherson, explains in this very entertaining video: “There is no one Australian accent.” Such is the mystery of the Australian accent to actors; despite myriad variations in our accents, dialects and idiolects (sometimes within the same city, let alone different states), Hollywood’s Australian accents often end up occupying the same uncanny valley. It may be a matter of preparation time, the dialect coach, and whether anyone on the production has, in fact, ever heard an Australian speak. So, who nailed it and who failed dismally? Let’s take a strained trip through ring-in Strine, from the ridiculous to the sublime. Jude Law’s accent as nefarious “Truth Serum” blogger Alan Krumwiede was so baffling it took years for me to realise, despite having watched Contagion roughly 45 times, that he was meant to be Australian. One critic, Luke Holland, described it as an accent “the likes of which is generally reserved for inter-country Ashes mockery”. I’d describe it as worthy of official trade sanctions against the US and UK. In this rock ’em sock ’em sci fi fantasy, Kazinsky (from Sussex, England) and Martini (New York, New York) pilot a massive robot Jaeger, the “evocatively” named Striker Eureka. Though both are allegedly from Sydney, their accents fall somewhere between Dick Van Dyke and a native New Yorker. It’s enough to make you want to see a giant alien monster take out the Opera House. And just while we’re on it, why is their team mascot a British bulldog? Ever heard of Red Dog? Or for that matter, where Australia is?! There’s a lot going on here, and most of it suggests that Downey spent his prep time for Oliver Stone’s cOnTrOvErSiAL thriller tossing back double shot espressos and watching that one episode of The Simpsons. (Which, for the record, will not be appearing in this Sorted list, thanks largely to the number of times I have been forced to smile and nod while having it quoted at me.) Downey went back for a second serving in Tropic Thunder, the favourite film of “you can’t say anything these days!!” people in comments sections. We all know Tarantino loves Ozsploitation, so it was perhaps unsurprising that he’d eventually include Australian characters in one of his films – we just didn’t expect him to play one of them. Despite having marinated in Australian cinema for years, the director ends up sounding as though he’s quoting Richard Roxburgh’s “South African” Hugo Stamp in Mission: Impossible 2. Oh well, at least he gets his comeuppance. OK, look, I know that Detective Robin Griffin was meant to have been born in Aotearoa New Zealand then moved to Sydney at a young age, but if there was any sense that Moss was consciously “doing” a Sam Neill or Russell Crowe here, it would have been fine. Instead, Griffin’s accent exists in a spooky netherworld between Australian and American. I guess it adds to the overall unsettling vibe of the series? Bad news: things didn’t improve in the 2017 sequel, Top of the Lake: China Girl, but at least Moss’s accent was overpowered by Nicole Kidman’s wig and fake teeth. Wow, 2012-13 sure was a banner era for fake Aussie accents, huh? PJ Hogan’s tender if, uh, broad family comedy of mental illness features Toni Collette doing an accent so Strine that Schreiber’s, as shark expert Trevor, doesn’t seem so bad by comparison. He was still in a relationship with Our Naomi Watts at the time, so it’s possible that some of his accent was influenced by exposure to “Aussies who got out”. Playing the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, Benadryl Cucumberbundt’s accent and idiolect are pretty good! (His lace-front wig, on the other hand, is the boot of all boots.) He has some of Assange’s vocal fry and vowel sounds down – listen to him say “one moral man, one whistleblower” – and for the most part doesn’t appear to be constantly thinking about the accent. For his part, Assange described the experience of listening to the performance as “grating”, though he appreciated the actor’s refusal to play Assange as (per director Bill Condon’s suggestion) a “sociopathic megalomaniac”. Did anyone actually see this movie? La Winslet’s first crack at an Australian accent came in Jane Campion’s high satire of religion and sex. Playing Ruth, who has been strong-armed into deprogramming by her family after falling into a new age cult in India, Winslet is every bit the Sans Souci backpacker turned too-good-for-you spiritualist. In a 2000 interview with the Guardian, Winslet described Ruth as “such a fucking little cow – although she was even more vile in the script. I had to be over-the-top and yet put a lid on her and make her believable.” Patel’s accent as Saroo Brierley is so convincing that I left the movie theatre pretty sure I had once had a conversation with him at a Fitzroy house party in 2007. Just listen to him yelling “What it’s like” and “25!” at Rooney Mara. If he occasionally slips into a London vowel sound in moments of high emotion, it’s forgivable, even logical – after all, his adoptive mum is Nicole “mid-Atlantic” Kidman. Here she is, folks, the queen of Australian accents, going toe to toe with the mighty Judy Davis in full flight. Thanks in no small part to the work of dialect coach Victoria Mielewska, Winslet takes the lessons learned on the set of Holy Smoke! and spins them into a fully embodied performance as Myrtle “Tilly” Dunnage in Jocelyn Moorhouse’s alternately hysterical and heartbreaking Australian gothic classic. “I’m back, you bastards!”",Arts/Film,"Ten Australian accents by foreign actors, from worst to best – sorted",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/04/ten-australian-accents-by-foreign-actors-from-worst-to-best-sorted
4/4/2022,"David Foster Wallace once wrote that Michael Chang had the unhappiest face he had seen outside of a graduate creative writing program. A few years ago, I was on a city loop train when a group of Carlton fans alighted at Spencer St. Suddenly, I was confronted with an entire carriage of Michael Changs. I have never seen a more miserable-looking bunch. GWS were basically playing with 16 men and were 100 points up with a quarter to run. The Carlton fans had seen enough. Their team had broken them. They had lost faith, hope, interest and, in some cases, their marbles. On Monday mornings, the players would issue tortured apologies. Former player Mark Maclure would appear on AFL 360 like a man contesting a parking ticket in the Magistrates Court. He would bemoan “20 years of rubbish”. What do they stand for, he would ask? What is in their DNA? After one game, the Herald Sun’s Mark Robinson questioned whether the Bluebirds, Carlton’s former dance troupe, would have tackled harder. After one of their players had transgressed, the entire playing group visited Ravenhall Prison. “One thing they lack,” Patrick Cripps said - presumably in reference to the inmates - “is a bit of purpose and direction”. Well, the dark days are gone. Carlton fans are smiling again. They have a new coach, president and chief executive. Their team is playing an old-school, eminently watchable brand of football. Their captain is arguably the best player in Australia right now. They are undefeated, and appear to have a pretty soft draw ahead. By jove, they did it the hard way on Sunday. Early on in the second term you could not have written a ticket on Hawthorn. They were seven goals down. They were being decimated out of the centre and in the air. But methodically, they chipped away at the margin. They are very much a team which relies on its rebounding defenders and Carlton started playing right into their hands. The Blues were bombing, the Hawks were spring-boarding off half back, and the most remarkable of comeback wins was on the cards. In the end, a desperate diving mark from Jacob Weitering secured the Carlton victory. There is nothing particularly sophisticated about how the Blues play. Michael Voss basically says: “Here’s our game style – good luck beating it.” They back themselves to win at the source, kick long to their tall targets and fight like buggery to lock it in. But, crucially, they have implemented a defensive press. In the past few years, they have been unable – or unwilling – to work defensively. The acquisition of George Hewitt – a big-bodied, no-frills midfielder who guards space and works both ways - has been crucial in this regard. He had nine clearances , complementing the work of his captain. On Sunday, as has been the case all season, Patrick Cripps was the dominant figure. In the last few years, it seemed as if the game may have passed him by. He was beaten up. He had been asked to do too much. He usually had two or three opponents hanging off him. He had a broken back, for heaven’s sake. “I can’t believe how badly he’s aged,” Leigh Matthews said. This year, he is noticeably leaner. His shoulders are no longer wall-papered. He is more willing to drift forward. He is still only 26. Yesterday, despite the close attention of Jaeger O’Meara and James Worpel in the second half, he still managed 31 disposals, 11 tackles and six clearances. Carlton’s win capped off a remarkable round of football, highlighted by the Showdown on Friday night, and Geelong’s rollicking comeback 24 hours later. For too long, Showdowns have been treated as an afterthought on the eastern seaboard, and by the host broadcasters. From go to whoa, this one was completely bonkers. It finished with Jordan Dawson, who had been excellent all night, reverse swinging a set shot from the boundary. He has played just three games for the Crows but they will remember him fondly for decades. Geelong’s comeback, and the game itself, was just as remarkable. Last year, the two sides played what may have been the dullest league game this century. Indeed, the Buckley-Scott era saw some truly ghastly affairs. But this was a cracker, with the Pies slamming on nine third term goals, prompting the infernal “Collingwood” chant. But Geelong are often a dangerous proposition when they are four or five goals down with a quarter to play and the coach releases the shackles. Collingwood suddenly looked very young and very brittle down back. Jordan De Goey, a menace all night, was now nowhere to be seen. For the first time this year, they resembled a Nathan Buckley team – playing safe, chipping sideways, overthinking things. Geelong smelt blood in the water. The captain did what he has been doing for 15 years. In the space of half an hour he had been chased down, harangued, booed and pensioned off. He then helped drag his team over the line and was seen off with a guard of honour. It was just another night at the office for Joel Selwood. But Sunday was about all about Carlton. In the next five weeks they play Gold Coast, Port Adelaide, Fremantle, North Melbourne and Adelaide. Michael Voss urged restraint. It is early April. The competition has not had time to figure them out. And Carlton fans are used to being teased, seduced and let down. They’ve watched hitherto useless clubs – clubs Carlton treated with contempt back in the day – get their act together and win premierships. But, for the time being, they are entitled to revel in it. That glorious theme song of theirs was blaring. Carlton has its swagger back, and football is all the more interesting for it.",Sport/Sport,"Carlton’s AFL dark days are gone, the swagger is back, and fans are smiling | Jonathan Horn",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/04/carltons-afl-dark-days-are-gone-the-swagger-is-back-and-fans-are-smiling
4/4/2022,"The Victorian government plans to restore an area five times the size of Melbourne as part of a new scheme to increase conservation on private land. The state’s energy, environment and climate change minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, has announced the government will spend $31m to revegetate parcels of private land to create habitat for endangered wildlife and capture carbon. The scheme, known as BushBank, will fund organisations such as Greening Australia, Bush Heritage, Trust for Nature, and traditional owner groups to work with private landowners to restore habitat and increase carbon storage. The program was included in the state’s 2020-21 budget but the Andrews government has waited until now to formally launch it. On Monday, it will call for expressions of interest to cover the first 20,000 hectares to be restored through the scheme. The $31m in funding available for the first stage will include $7m in grants for traditional owner corporations for restoration on country. The government has set a target of eventually restoring 200,000 hectares of private land for conservation as part of the 20-year biodiversity strategy it launched in 2017. D’Ambrosio said it was a new approach for the state that she hoped would deliver the scale of environmental change that was needed in Victoria. “This money is about putting trees and vegetation in the ground and projects that connect up pockets of biodiversity to create biodiversity corridors,” she said. D’Ambrosio said the powerful owl, the southern brown bandicoot, the southern greater glider and the alpine bog skink were among the species whose habitat could be improved. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning She said areas such as the Gippsland region, the state’s north-east and north-west, and land around Portland in the state’s south-west were valuable places for nature that could benefit from projects. “This is also about the carbon storage potential of those areas,” she said. The state has set a target of reducing its emissions by 45-50% on 2005 levels by 2030 and has a net zero by 2050 target. The announcement comes at a time when the Andrews government has been under scrutiny for its management of threatened habitat, particular in areas affected by logging that are currently the subject of several legal challenges. A report last year by the state’s auditor general found the Victorian environment department was unable to demonstrate it was halting the decline of threatened species. Jody Gunn, the chief executive of the Australian Land Conservation Alliance, said the investment in private land conservation was welcome. She said more than 60% of land in Australia was privately held but less than 2% of this area was managed for nature. She said more support for voluntary conservation by landholders was “an essential part of securing the future of our wildlife and the health of our rivers, forests and farmland”. “Thousands of landholders across the country have already chosen to make space for nature on their land, and it is great to see the Victorian government stepping up to invest further in private land conservation,” Gunn said. Gunn said state governments had taken the lead on private land conservation and there was a need for more federal investment in this area. She said the alliance was calling on parties at the federal election to commit to more funding for private land conservation in partnership with state governments.",News/Australia news,Victoria to restore area five times size of Melbourne with $31m boost to private land conservation ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/04/victoria-to-restore-area-five-times-size-of-melbourne-with-31m-boost-to-private-land-conservation
4/4/2022,"If you have watched more than a fleeting moment of the Women’s Cricket World Cup over the past month, you will be intimately acquainted with Gin Wigmore’s Girl Gang – the song which accompanies the entry of the teams on to the field each match and plays on a seemingly continuous loop the rest of the time. On the surface it is an upbeat, peppy tune. In the context of the Australian team, though, its lyrics take on a more ominous tone. Suddenly the lines “I got the strength to tear it apart” and “we’re taking over the world” do not come across as metaphorical and the idea of some kind of Meg Lanning-controlled dictatorship seems entirely within the realms of possibility. From start to finish at this tournament, Lanning’s Australian team have been ruthless. There is no better word to capture the way they have gone about their business. Competition for a spot in the playing XI has been far fiercer than the competition they have faced on the field. From established stars such as Lanning, Ellyse Perry and Alyssa Healy through to the newer faces of Alana King, Darcie Brown and Tahlia McGrath, there was no weakness to exploit, not a glimmer of hope on which an opposition could cling. England were valiant in defeat in the final, but in reality they had little chance of stopping this juggernaut. Australia have long had sensational cricketers in their team. Throughout the history of the women’s game, there has not been a time they have lacked world-class players. The team which failed to make the World Cup final in 2017 was bursting with talent. The biggest change since that tournament has nothing to do with the skill of individual players and everything to do with how they operate as a team. There is accountability and responsibility across the squad – Lanning and coach Matthew Mott have recognised the contributions each of their players can make in terms of leadership and team culture, and it has been to everyone’s advantage. No longer does the team treat winning as a given – wicket celebrations have been joyful and genuine no matter the opposition and stage of the tournament. That joy carries into the other areas of their game. On the rare occasion a catch was dropped or an opportunity missed, players offered a rueful smile, an apology and a vow to do better next time. There has been no blame or anger, no negative body language in the field. Off the field, as well, they have looked like a team on top of the world. Although Grace Harris did not manage to force her way into the playing squad, her spirits have clearly been high, and the sight of her nattering away to teammates on the benches was a feature of every game. There is a sense of togetherness that has united these highly skilled individuals and made them an unstoppable team. With the debut of women’s T20 cricket at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham later this year and a T20 World Cup in South Africa next year, there are plenty of opportunities for this implacable force to keep gathering momentum. While many of the team’s senior players are now in their 30s and the distant twinkle of retirement becoming brighter and clearer, the depth in Australian women’s cricket offers an embarrassment of riches. From Darcie Brown, who already has a world championship to her name at 19 years old, to those waiting in the wings – Hannah Darlington (20), Stella Campbell (19) and Maitlan Brown (24) with the ball, to Georgia Voll (18), Phoebe Litchfield (18) and Ruth Johnston (19) with the bat, the next generation are already highly equipped to play international cricket. If they represented any other nation, they would have been at this tournament. It is not simply a special group of players at the top right now, but a seemingly never-ending talent factory, churning out ready-made stars on a conveyor belt of excellence with the ability to dominate for the next decade and beyond. With the blueprint now in place for a robust team culture, these young stars will take their place when the time comes, knowing they will not be thrown to the wolves, but enveloped within the glowing embrace of a team who play for each other in every moment. While the almost-village atmosphere of Christchurch’s Hagley Oval, gently teeming with polite New Zealanders at socially distanced intervals, was worlds away from a screaming, packed Melbourne Cricket Ground on International Women’s Day in 2020, the vibe emanating from the winning team on Sunday was much the same. Different as it was, it is likely those involved will cherish this win just as much. It is that rare combination of ruthlessness and joy which unites these two disparate moments and shows what a special team this is and will continue to be, long into the future.",Sport/Sport,Australia full of individual stars but team approach won the World Cup | Megan Maurice,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/04/australia-full-of-individual-stars-but-team-approach-won-womens-cricket-world-cup
4/4/2022,"Iranian refugee Hossein Latifi has been released from Melbourne’s Park hotel, along with nine other people, after nine years in immigration detention. Latifi was released on Friday – his 33rd birthday. It was the first time in almost a decade he had been able to celebrate outside the walls of a detention centre. “I spoke to Australian Border Force and I said ‘Where is my cake?’” he says. As Latifi took his first steps outside detention he felt as if a huge weight had been lifted. “When I was in detention, I felt like my mind was going to blow up,” Latifi says. “But when your feet are outside detention you feel a release. Like you’re born again.” A fortnight ago, about 50 refugees and asylum seekers who were brought to Australia for medical treatment were being held in detention in Australia – including 18 in the Park hotel.It’s thought about 30 medevac refugees and asylum seekers now remain in onshore detention. Advocates estimate about 20 people were released on Friday from detention centres in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane but it has been difficult to get accurate data on the number of people still detained under the medevac laws. Latifi says recent releases are “absolutely due to the upcoming federal election”. “I have a big hope that my friends will be released soon,” he says. Latifi was first detained in 2013 when he was 24 years old after arriving in Australia by boat. He spent six years on Nauru before he was transferred to Australia for medical treatment in 2020. Some of Latifi’s toughest years were on Nauru where he slept in a stifling tent crammed with other refugees and asylum seekers. “There was no air conditioning. It was so hot, I felt like we were melting,” he says. In the past few years at the Park hotel there has been a fire, a Covid-19 outbreak and allegedly maggots in dinners. But it was the detention of tennis great, Novak Djokovic, at the facility earlier this year that brought the greatest media attention. Latifi says his time in detention hardened him but there were moments when he felt overwhelmed by the uncertainty stretching in front of him. “I’ve swallowed three razors, I hurt my arm and got seven stitches in 2019. I got five stitches in 2016 because the situation was very bad. Unbelievable,” he says. “You say, I’m done. After committing zero crimes, they still call you detainees. It affects you mentally.” Sister Brigid Arthur, the project coordinator of the Brigidine Asylum Seekers Project, says when refugees are released they still face uncertainty. They receive temporary bridging visas, a small amount of money and two weeks’ accommodation. She says without comprehensive assistance from the government it falls on the wider community to step in and provide support. “We’ve housed between 40 and 50 people and we’re a small non-for-profit organisation that relies on donations,” Arthur says. “They need to be able to access the services [such as Centrelink] that are available to Australians.” The staggered releases have left asylum seekers questioning why some are freed while others are left behind. “There’s no rhyme or reason about who is released. You can’t work out any pattern,” Arthur says. “We will never undo long-term detention. It’s been so cruel. But it’s amazing how resilient so many of them are.” The minister for home affairs, Karen Andrews, said on Friday that “Australia has some of the strongest border protection arrangements in the world”. “This government’s agreement to resettle refugees in New Zealand demonstrates once again that there is no path to settlement in Australia if you come illegally by boat,” she said. The Department of Home Affairs said “it does not comment on individual cases” when asked about Latifi’s release. “Individuals released from immigration detention are provided transitional support through the status resolution support services program including case worker support, accommodation and financial assistance,” a spokesperson said. The department said “the final departure bridging visa” enables asylum seekers to reside in the community “while they make plans to depart Australia”. For Latifi, even the little things like going for a walk and getting a coffee are healing. “You are free. No more security … and when I call my mum, she’s going to cry,” he says. “So many people have told me that I should be proud of myself [for surviving] and I told them I am. I don’t want to live in my past. I have to start my new life – my dream.” Latifi hopes to be resettled in New Zealand but could be excluded from the Australia-NZ refugee deal because he previously engaged with the US resettlement pathway.

4/4/2022,"In 1934, as Adolf Hitler consolidated his grip on power in Germany, a courageous group of Protestant pastors resisted attempts to create a pro-Nazi unified Reich Church. In what became known as the Barmen Declaration, they asserted the absolute separation of church and state, rejecting the “false doctrine” that “the church in human arrogance could place the Word and work of the Lord in the service of any arbitrarily chosen desires, purposes, and plans”. It is a measure of these disturbing times that last month hundreds of Orthodox Christian clergy, scholars and lay people felt the need to issue a similar declaration, excoriating the complicity of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) in Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Their document, entitled A Declaration on the “Russian World” Teaching, condemns Patriarch Kirill of Moscow for providing theological cover for a barbarous and illegal war. Kirill, who had close links with the KGB in Soviet times, has described Mr Putin’s leadership as a religious miracle. As bombs have rained down on Ukrainian cities, he has asserted that it is “God’s truth” that the people of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus should be reunited as one spiritual people. During a sermon delivered in Moscow last month, he portrayed the invasion of Ukraine as part of a “metaphysical” struggle against a decadent west – a civilisation deemed to have capitulated to materialism, moral relativism, globalisation and the promotion of homosexuality. Having become a vassal of the sinful west, Ukraine must be saved and restored to “Holy Rus”. This kind of conflation of race, nation and the church, the authors of the “Russian world” declaration point out, has previously been condemned as a heresy by the Orthodox tradition. In a country where 71% of the population identify as Orthodox, and Mr Putin presents himself as a defender of the values of the church, Kirill’s views offer powerful legitimation to the president’s geopolitical ambitions. As a result, amid a global Christian backlash, the ROC is fast becoming a pariah church within a pariah state. Last week, the spiritual leader of the world’s Orthodox Christians, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, denounced the invasion of Ukraine as an “atrocious” act. More than 280 Russian Orthodox priests and church officials from around the world have signed an open letter condemning the war. Despite intimidation and threats from Moscow, the ROC in Amsterdam has condemned Kirill and defected to the Istanbul-based Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. In Ukraine, where part of the Orthodox church left the Moscow patriarchate in 2019, Russian Orthodox leaders have distanced themselves from Kirill and condemned the invasion. As Orthodox Christianity takes a stand, other Christian leaders must also do their bit to make it clear that Kirill’s militant fusion of ethno-nationalism, authoritarianism and religious identity is beyond the pale. Initially reluctant to make the full force of his opposition to Mr Putin public, Pope Francis has begun to harden his language, telling the patriarch that the concept of a holy or just war cannot be reconciled with Christian teaching. The World Council of Churches, which represents 580 million Christians of various denominations around the world, has unsuccessfully urged Kirill to use his influence with Mr Putin to intercede for peace. An emerging lobby within it is now calling for the ROC to be expelled. Such a move would go against a natural instinct to promote Christian unity. But just as Russian oligarchs have been sanctioned and isolated on the grounds that they provide succour and support to Mr Putin, Orthodox Christianity’s rogue affiliate in Moscow should pay a high price for hitching its theology to the murderous ambitions of a dictator.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the Russian Orthodox Church: betrayed by Putin’s patriarch | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/03/the-guardian-view-on-the-russian-orthodox-church-betrayed-by-putins-patriarch

I was in the process of having a delightful nap right on my laurels. If anything, I was actively trying to waste my time. But sadly, sickeningly, I have undergone self-improvement. Worst of all, I know where the blame lies – TikTok. TikTok was the first app that really made me feel old. Or, worse, realise that I am not young any more. I did not understand it, I did not have the energy to engage with it, and I had no desire to ever post on it. Starting a TikTok account in your 30s felt like investing in a toupee. Just let it go, dude, it’s over. I was very much of the opinion that TikTok was primarily for choreographed dances performed to the same eight seconds of a song you heard in a Cotton On once and clips from Family Guy season four with captions like “Stewie Wilding FR”. This assumption, it turns out, was absolutely correct. But! There is another important aspect that I had not realised. The much-vaunted TikTok algorithm greatly rewards useful information delivered simply. This is something creators have noticed and pounced on. I was shocked. Social media apps aren’t meant to improve your life. They’re designed to help you find your niche and use that niche to slowly erode your sanity. Now, when you use the app you get your serving of dances, Stewie behaving in a way a baby absolutely shouldn’t behave, endlessly repetitive low-effort prank videos but also tutorials, lifehacks, and worthwhile bits of knowledge. A quick flick through while definitely not procrastinating writing this very article delivered me a tutorial on the vanishing point in art, a guide to men’s wedding fashion by the season, how to get perfect form on incline dumbbell presses and a LinkedIn page optimisation strategy, all delivered with the backing track of the same annoying nine seconds of a song and intercut with clips of a guy walking around a Woolworths saying something rude and pretending he’s actually talking to a friend on the phone. As a long-term user of the other major social media platforms, I have felt my once functional brain slowly turn into a kind of cold porridge through hours of endless scrolling. Now it seems as if at the very least I am getting some benefit out of the process, like I’m receiving a tasty baked treat for the small fee of allowing the Chinese government to fire electrodes directly into my brain for an hour. It has permeated every aspect of my life. The meals I proudly present at dinner parties are from TikTok, the exercises I struggle through at the gym I’ve learned from TikTok, and while my fashion sense hasn’t particularly changed, I can at least recognise why it’s so awful now. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Of course, it wouldn’t be social media without a horrible dark side just under the surface. If you’re male and interested in workout or dieting content, the app will every so often see if you’d like to flirt with the soft alt-right. Oh, you like lat raises? Well, here’s a strange man in a lecture hall delivering two minutes on the psychology of the female brain. Plus, you would be hard-pressed to find an app that’s more bald-faced in its consumerism. ‘TikTok Made Me Buy It’ is a regular catchcry. There’s an abundance of accounts where stringy twentysomethings try to trigger artificial bumps to shitcoins. And the whole thing is designed to steal our data while it slow-cooks our brains. Be that as it may, it is more energetic, fun and downright useful than any of the other major social media apps. What I am saying, dear Guardian reader, is that you should follow my lead, overcome your scepticism, and give this app a try. That way, we can ruin it the same way we’ve ruined all the other social platforms and I’ll finally go outside and touch some grass.

4/4/2022,"Aged care industry bodies and unions have criticised the Morrison government for failing to commit to fully fund any pay increases ordered as a result of the sector’s work value case. Aged and Community Services Australia (ACSA) and Leading Age Services Australia (Lasa) have both warned that providers would not be able to pay the increase meaning the industrial tribunal would need to order a smaller rise – or operators could be forced to close. The stoush over pay in the sector comes as Labor announces the next plank of its aged care policy – which would attempt to stop rorting of home care users by capping administration fees and requiring monthly reporting on where fees are spent. In his budget reply speech last week, the opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, pledged a Labor government would fully fund any pay rise ordered by the Fair Work Commission in the work value case. Unions are seeking pay rises of $5 an hour for aged care workers. On Friday, Scott Morrison said the Coalition would ensure the decision, expected in the second half of 2022, was “honoured” but stopped short of committing to fund any pay rises ordered. The federal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said on Sunday that the Coalition would “take responsibility” for pay increases in government-run aged care but when it came to the private sector its contribution would be determined with input from the independent pricing authority. The ACSA chief executive, Paul Sadler, told Guardian Australia that “residential aged care services are not in a position to cover a wage increase” because 60% are running at a loss and most of the remainder only break even or run a small profit. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Profitability has declined “significantly” in the past three years due to falling occupancy, despite an increase of $10 a resident a day in the 2021 budget, he said. Sadler said it was “deeply disappointing” Frydenberg had cited advice from the independent pricing authority as an excuse, noting legislation to establish the body, due to begin by July 2023, hasn’t passed parliament yet. “The Fair Work Commission has to consider the capacity of the employer to pay. “There is a risk if there is no guarantee of funding from the government, the commission would be forced to consider a smaller pay increase. That’s not what we want for our workforce.” The Lasa chief executive, Sean Rooney, said operators were “experiencing financial pressure due to increased operating costs and the chronic underfunding identified by the royal commission”. “[The pay rise] must be fully funded by government,” he said. “In other sectors, the providers can increase prices but in aged care, they can’t, that’s the way the sector is structured and regulated. If the government doesn’t fund it, it will push more services to the brink, resulting in more and more services closing. “Look at the human cost: people missing out on services or receiving services not consistently to standard; and workers frustrated because they are overworked and leaving the sector.” Carolyn Smith, the aged care director of the United Workers Union, said if the government didn’t fund the increase it “can’t happen”. “What they’re saying is they don’t want aged care workers to have a pay rise,” she said. “They’re happy to call them the heroes of the pandemic, pat them on head and say what a lovely, fantastic job they’ve done – but they’re essentially saying they don’t deserve a pay rise. “That’s the message they’re sending to thousands of workers who worked through the pandemic, through double and triple shifts during the Omicron wave.” Smith noted that more than 10,000 workers for seven large providers had filed to take protected industrial action, meaning if the government continued to “sit on its hands” aged care staff could go on strike by early May – just weeks before the election. Lloyd Williams, the national secretary of the Health Services Union, said funding aged care was a commonwealth responsibility regardless of whether care was provided by state-run centres, not-for-profit or for-profit providers. “If the commonwealth refuses to provide funding to aged care providers as a consequence of the FWC decision, they will cause the aged care system to fail.” Williams accused the government of “ducking and weaving” to avoid a clear commitment on funding and “obfuscating” the funding arrangement. On Monday, Labor will announce a policy on capping home care administration fees and price transparency to ensure more home care fees are spent on care. It cited a Grattan Institute report that 25% of home care fees are taken up by administration and management costs – or as high as 50% according to evidence to the royal commission. Albanese said “whether you are in residential care or home care, Australians should have confidence the money they are paying is going where it should – towards their care”. The shadow minister for aged care, Claire O’Neil, said it was “time users of home care packages got better value for money”.",News/Australia news,Aged care bodies and unions demand Coalition match Labor’s pledge to fund potential wage rises,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/04/aged-care-bodies-and-unions-demand-coalition-match-labors-pledge-to-fund-potential-wage-rises

The alleged perpetrator has been charged with two counts of rape and one count of strangulation, with a trial date still to be set. “I was strangled and raped,” Lisa alleges, referring to the charges. “Since then, I have just been on income protection which was substantially reduced from my normal wage,” Lisa said. “It’s been a struggle surviving on that money.” Lisa said when she first called Victim Assist Queensland asking for support, she was told the wait time would be two years and that financial hardship would not fast-track her application. She also rang Centrelink to see if she was eligible for a crisis payment. “But because I didn’t apply within seven days of [moving home after the alleged incident], I wasn’t eligible.” Lisa’s wait was far from the longest.There are 394 domestic violence victims still waiting for a decision on applications made two years ago to VAQ, according to Queensland government figures tabled last week. This is reflective of the overall demand for assistance from victims of crime and those who have experienced domestic violence, with applications to VAQ rising by 16% so far this financial year. The increasing demand has brought with it extensive delays, with the average wait time blowing out to 114 days for all applications received from March 2020. The longest wait time for a case finalised in 2021 was 1,180 days. It is unclear whether that was for an application under the victims of crime payment or for domestic violence assistance. Those statistics were revealed last week in a response from Queensland’s attorney general, Shannon Fentiman, to a question on notice from Greens MP for Maiwar, Michael Berkman. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Berkman tells the Guardian it is “completely unacceptable that domestic violence victim-survivors are waiting so long for victim assist payments”. “Even under the government’s new ‘streamlined process’ people are waiting nearly four months, and it’s just not good enough,” Berkman said. “Not having the financial means to escape a violent relationship literally puts people’s lives at risk. We need the state government to do better.” Fentiman said in the response that VAQ prioritises “urgent and immediate expenses” including for funerals, medical treatment and security and relocation expenses referred through the “high-risk teams”. In a statement to Guardian Australia, Fentiman said since financial assistance under VAQ was extended in 2017 to include non-physical forms of domestic and family violence, an 78% increase in applications has been recorded. “To support VAQ to handle this increased demand we have invested an additional $1m per annum for an extra 10 full-time staff to help process cases,” Fentiman said. “As a government, ending violence against women is a top priority which is why we have invested over $600m to tackle DFV since 2015.” Lisa has been diagnosed with post-traumatic disorder and says she is currently unable to work. She’s set aside the $10,000 “recognition payment” from VAQ to pay her rent, but is still awaiting a decision over her medical costs, along with tens in thousands she’s lost in wages. Now, Lisa says she’s growing anxious over what she’ll do once her income protection runs out in July. “When you’re at the most vulnerable, it seems to navigate the system you have to be your own advocate, and that takes a lot of strength to do that,” Lisa said. “There seems to be a lot of token gestures … but to me, it hasn’t translated into much actual tangible assistance.” *Name has been changed to protect the individual’s identity In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14 and the national family violence counselling service is on 1800 737 732.

4/4/2022,"Our favourite memories and important documents used to be kept as physical objects: photo albums, scrapbooks, postcards, contracts and certificates of ownership. That meant, when we died, these things would be relatively accessible to the loved ones we left behind. In the internet era, a lot of that information is stored in the cloud. Everything from photos and videos to emails, documents and contracts, and even social media posts are not easily accessible without legacy planning. Like me, many people also use social media for private journaling of family memories, in the hope those posts can still be seen in the future. Moreover, reminders from social media platforms about a deceased person can be painful and upsetting. While it is a morbid thought, taking stock of your digital life and planning what will happen when you’re no longer there to log in is critical to ensuring that your information can be easily and responsibly taken care of. This is an issue that online platforms are increasingly aware of, and many now allow you to issue instructions for what should happen in the event of your death. Depending on the platform, both preservation and deletion of your account are possible, but it does require forethought, and each platform has a different process. In December of 2021, Apple introduced legacy contacts, allowing you to choose one or more trusted people to access your account after your death. You generate and share an access key with your nominated contact. After you die, your contact will need to request access, provide the key you shared, and upload your death certificate to access your Apple account. Upon approval, your legacy contact will have three years to view photos, messages, notes, files, apps and other data, and make decisions about what should happen to the information. You can take proactive steps to safeguard the data in your Google account, whether that be photos, documents or even your Google Pay account. Google’s Inactive Account Manager allows you to make a plan for your death, by outlining when Google should consider your account to be inactive. You can set the inactivity waiting period to between three and 18 months. After the set time has elapsed, automated messages will be sent to nominated mobile numbers and email addresses, informing them of the inactivity. You can choose up to 10 people for Google to notify if your account becomes inactive. You can also choose to share specific data such as Google Calendar, Chrome, Pay, and Photos with nominated people for three months after the account becomes inactive. Finally, you can also tell Google to delete your inactive account and all of its content. Deletion takes place three months after the account becomes inactive. Facebook also allows you to add a legacy contact who can manage your account when you have died. A legacy contact can view private “only me” posts, pin a tribute post, change your profile and cover picture and request the deletion of your account. However, the legacy contact will only be able to perform these activities after the account is memorialised. In a memorialised account, the word “remembering” is placed next to your name, and friends and family can share memories on the page’s memorialised timeline. Facebook memorialises accounts when a family member or close friend lets them know of your death. Lastly, you also have the choice of having your account permanently deleted upon death. If you choose this option, when someone informs Facebook of your passing, the account will be permanently deleted. Unfortunately, Twitter does not appear to have a way to memorialise an account, nor the ability to provide a legacy contact’s details. It also does not provide account access to anyone regardless of their relationship to the deceased. Nevertheless, an authorised person or family member of a deceased person can contact Twitter to have the account deactivated, upon providing further information about the deceased, a copy of their ID, and a copy of the deceased’s death certificate. Instagram, which Facebook owns, has memorialising and deletion features that are similar to Facebook. But it doesn’t offer the option of adding a legacy contact. Instead, anyone can make requests for an account to be memorialised by providing proof of death. Only verified immediate family members or lawful representatives of the deceased can request deletion of accounts. LinkedIn also does not currently provide a way to give a legacy contact’s details. It only offers the functionality to memorialise or close a deceased member’s account. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Family members or authorised persons can only make requests to memorialise or close an account. However, other LinkedIn members can report a deceased person, and upon verification, the account is hidden from public view. Like Twitter, it also does not disclose usernames or passwords to anyone, including family members. To date, Microsoft appears to have taken a very hands-off approach in dealing with the accounts of deceased users. It does not offer any way of nominating a next of kin to access the account, and the account is inevitably closed after two years of inactivity. Last but not least, you can leave details of all your digital assets – accounts, usernames and passwords – with a trusted friend or family member who can help bring closure. This can be particularly useful for platforms where nominating a legacy contact isn’t possible. Digital legacy planning may be difficult, but it will make life a little easier for those close to you. After all, you don’t want your online information to be lost or misused when you are gone.

4/4/2022,"Melbourne airport must adopt new health-based metrics based on World Health Organization research for its proposed third runway to ensure people aren’t exposed to harmful noise levels, a group of transport experts say. The $1.9bn proposal for the airport’s 3km third runway, due to open by the end of the decade, will be submitted to the federal government for approval next year. The Victorian Transport Action Group (Vtag), an independent forum of transport experts including former transport bureaucrats, political staffers and council workers, has urged the airport to overhaul the metrics being used to determine the impact of noise. It said the airport’s current noise impact metrics were not fit for purpose as they only take into account “distraction” and disturbance to nearby communities, without considering the risk of health deterioration due to noise. “The health of a growing number of people exposed to airport noise is of increasing concern,” Vtag said. Residents in areas to the north and south of the airport who will be the most affected by additional flights have separately raised concerns about noise levels during the consultation phase for the project, which ends next month. Melbourne airport uses the Australian Noise Exposure Forecast (Anef) – standardised across Australia for statutory planning purposes. Across Australia, land with an Anef of less than 20 is regarded as being acceptable for residential dwellings. In a submission on the project, Vtag said the airport should instead draw on WHO research published in 2018 that linked aircraft-generated noise to noise distress, sleep disturbance levels and delays in cognitive development. The WHO research concluded the maximum average daytime noise level should be below 45db – which Vtag argues is comparable to Anef 10. “Given recent research and recommendations from WHO, the Anef contours … are inadequate to properly protect the health of the surrounding airport community,” Vtag said in its submission. Vtag also argued the federal government should not approve the airport’s proposal until a wider independent review of the existing noise metrics is undertaken that focuses on community health. The airport has argued the third runway is essential to cope with future growth demands, including tourism and freight needs. It has forecast annual passenger numbers will grow from 37 million to more than 76 million by 2042. A spokesperson for the airport said it encouraged people to explore its interactive noise and flight path tool on its website to “familiarise themselves with the forecast changes in their area”. “Melbourne airport is being as upfront as possible with the community about the benefits and impacts associated with the new runway, and has applied methodology for modelling and describing noise and its impacts, in line with Australian regulation and best practice.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Melbourne airport chief executive, Lyell Strambi, has vowed to engage with residents in the hope of avoiding a repeat of the situation at Brisbane airport, where local residents claimed they were misled about the noise from a second runway. Brisbane airport is now trialling interim noise-reduction changes after an independent forum – established by the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce – made a series of recommendations after noise complaints were made about the airport’s parallel runway, which opened in June 2020. The Aircraft Noise Ombudsman found Airservices Australia had not provided enough information to residents about the impacts of the flight path changes.",News/Australia news,"‘Not fit for purpose’: new noise benchmark needed for Melbourne’s third runway, group says ",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/04/not-fit-for-purpose-new-noise-benchmark-needed-for-melbournes-third-runway-group-says
4/4/2022,"This is not the competition that will define whether Rotherham United deem this a successful season but after Jordi Osei-Tutu’s 96th-minute equaliser ensured a topsy-turvy game went to extra time, they put their foot down to secure what they hope will not be the only silverware of the campaign. A stunning strike by Chiedozie Ogbene, who recently scored for the Republic of Ireland against Belgium, registered Rotherham’s third goal of the afternoon to set them on their way to lifting the EFL Trophy before Michael Ihiekwe sealed the comeback against Sutton. With their promotion quest on the back burner for the weekend, Rotherham came into this game as favourites but the League One leaders were faced with a team with little appetite to hang around League Two for long and seemingly no care for expectations. At the start of the season the Sutton chairman of 26 years, Bruce Elliott, present for the club’s last trip to Wembley, when they lost to Bishop’s Stortford in the 1981 FA Trophy final, and manager Matt Gray set out a 50-point target, which they surpassed with three months and the small matter of a cup final to spare. The precursor to kick-off was surreal – Paul Chuckle and Tim Vine, celebrity fans of Rotherham and Sutton respectively, whizzed round the pitch on Papa Johns-branded mopeds before delivering the match ball on to a plinth – and the match itself was equally entertaining. Richard Wood, who scored twice in Rotherham’s League One playoff final win here in 2018, got up for an early header but it was Sutton who had the first real sight of goal. David Ajiboye did the leg work, storming forward and evading four red shirts before laying the ball on for Will Randall, who dragged wide. Both teams had won one of their five previous matches but the Rotherham manager Paul Warne conceded that picking holes while they remain a point clear of third-placed MK Dons, with seven league games to play, is akin to “millionaire problems”. But Rotherham were ruffled when Donovan Wilson opened the scoring, coolly picking his spot after they failed to clear Ajiboye’s cross and until Ben Wiles’s spectacular effort crashed in off the underside of the crossbar they seemed short of initiative. Suddenly Rotherham were energised, leading scorer Michael Smith testing Dean Bouzanis in the Sutton goal, but Sutton pressed the reset button three minutes into the second half, with their captain and former Arsenal trainee Craig Eastmond scooping in after his initial shot was blocked, to regain the lead. The Sutton substitute Isaac Olaofe rattled the side netting in search of a killer third goal and Bouzanis was kept busy at the other end. He was alert to prevent a deflected Wiles shot squeezing inside a post and then Rotherham squandered a couple of openings that it seemed would live with them on the journey home. The substitute Freddie Ladapo shot straight at Bouzanis after latching on to a defence-splitting pass and Smith fired over but six minutes into seven minutes of stoppage time another substitute, Osei-Tutu, thrashed in to take the game to extra time. From there, Rotherham ratcheted through the gears. Ogbene took one touch to steady himself before dispatching a thunderous right-foot strike into the top corner six minutes into extra time and the defender Ihiekwe headed in to clinch victory in the fourth.",Sport/Football,Rotherham lift Papa John’s Trophy after fightback sinks Sutton in extra time,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/03/rotherham-sutton-united-papa-johns-trophy-final-match-report-wembley
4/4/2022,"With filming under way in Sheffield and Manchester for the remake of 1990s cult classic The Full Monty, the UK’s male strip scene is undergoing a makeover of its own, and paving the way for changes expected right across the entertainment industry as punters avoid city centre nightlife in favour of at-home entertainment. Covid led to a surge in activities organised by and for local communities as people were confined to their immediate area. With restrictions lifted across the UK, many entertainers who spent the pandemic struggling for business are now increasingly being booked for out-of-town gigs in suburban and rural areas, and in venues such as social clubs, apartments and even old people’s homes – rather than city centre bars and nightclubs. When the original Full Monty film first hit cinemas 25 years ago, audiences around the world fell in love with the group of lads from post-industrial Sheffield who, having lost their jobs at the local steelworks, turned to stripping to earn an income. The film received international acclaim and was nominated for an Oscar, before being turned into a hit Broadway musical. “That movie gave the male stripping scene a significant boost,” says David Sargeant, who has worked in the industry for 26 years and is director of adult entertainment agency Eye Candy UK. “The Full Monty highlighted how a night of good quality, harmless fun can bring people together and create important moments of joy and levity.” Sargeant cites a number of factors in the shift away from city centres, including the fact that young people are less interested in going out. “The cost of living means it’s more appealing for people to save their money and stay at home to socialise with friends and family,” he says. “This way, the entertainment comes to them.” Martin Reid, director of Party Strip UK, agrees. He says his agency has seen a surge in bookings for performances at old people’s homes lately. “A lot of what we do is actually very family-orientated. Kissograms, for example, are appropriate for audiences of all ages and can add a lot of fun to a family do.” Reid also notes that the volume of weddings taking place after two years of Covid postponements means the industry is finding its feet again after a challenging period. “Like all performers, we’ve gone from famine to feast as things have opened up again”, he says. “The number of hen party bookings is through the roof right now.” John Woodward, who runs he entertainment agency UK Pleasure Boys, feels this is a positive thing for the stripping community, too. “Performances in local venues are so vibrant and fun,” he says. Woodward, a former stripper who often performed in Sheffield in the late 90s and featured in Sky One documentary The Real Full Monty, says the appetite for performances in places like social and working men’s clubs is seeing “a definite revival”. “These days, instead of 18-year-old girls making nightclub bookings, their mothers and even grandmothers are joining them to see our shows in smaller venues. There are bigger audiences – and it’s all because we’re going to where the people are.” He adds: “Six-packs and tracksuits became popular after Magic Mike came out, but British audiences still love the traditional costumes – things like navy officers, firemen and policemen. The Full Monty proved that even very average guys with normal jobs and less-than-perfect physiques can put on a brilliant show.”",News/UK news,Male striptease moves from UK city centres to small clubs – and even homes,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/03/male-striptease-moves-from-uk-city-centres-to-small-clubs-and-even-homes
4/4/2022,"Imran Khan’s dramatic move to dissolve Pakistan’s parliament on Sunday morning, ahead of a vote that almost certainly would have removed him from office, reads to many like the desperate actions of a prime minister who will try to hold on to power at any cost. While his repeated allegations of a “foreign conspiracy” and pressure from the US being behind the no-confidence vote has played well to his diehard supporters, most of whom are vehemently opposed to the west, it is still a very risky move for Khan. He has lost almost all of his powerful allies and cuts an increasingly isolated figure in Pakistani politics. Khan’s former ally, the powerful army military establishment – who like to maintain a facade of having little to do with politics in Pakistan despite wielding vast influence – took the unusual step of clearly stating they had nothing to do with his decision and even criticised the unilateral dissolution of parliament. The deputy attorney general also resigned, unable to defend Khan, and more members of Khan’s coalition defected to the opposition in protest. The vital next step now lies with the supreme court to decide if Khan has violated the constitution and if the no-confidence vote should proceed. While Pakistan’s judiciary has long been seen as pro-establishment and their independence repeatedly called into question, the mood in Islamabad appears to have shifted notably against Khan and many believe the court will rule against him. While it is unclear what Khan’s approach will be if the no-confidence vote goes ahead, many fear it will lead to mass arrests of opposition politicians to try to bring the numbers back into Khan’s favour. Even if the parliament dissolution is upheld, the move still puts Khan in a considerably weakened position to fight an election in the next 90 days. It has further united and galvanised the opposition coalition, while alienating more members of his own increasingly fragile ruling coalition. Claims of a western conspiracy are unlikely to save his skin with voters, who are suffering from record-high inflation and an economic crisis. But for many in Islamabad, it is the growing spectre of interference from a military that has a long and chequered history of seizing power in such moments of turmoil that is the most worrying development of all.",News/World news,Imran Khan appears to want to keep power in Pakistan at any cost,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/03/imran-khan-appears-to-want-to-keep-power-in-pakistan-at-any-cost
4/4/2022,"My mother, Zahra Jama, who has died aged 80, was one of the first Somali women to come to Britain in the late 1950s, at a time when London’s Somali community was almost exclusively male. She was warmly acknowledged as a mother figure and her home was always a welcoming place for newly arrived Somalis. In many ways a trailblazer for Muslim women in 1960s London, she was determined to integrate and to build a better life for her family in the East End. Her seven children were often the only people of colour in their class, and she made sure they were impeccably dressed and had a strong sense of self. Zahra was born in Hargeisa, the capital of the British Somaliland Protectorate, to Jama Deria, a nurse, and his wife, Khadija Farah. At the age of 17, Zahra made the courageous decision to leave her homeland and emigrate to London with her husband, Omar Musa, and their first child. They boarded the SS Orsova in Aden, arriving in Britain in 1959. She initially struggled to find housing and work in a racially hostile environment, but she met the challenge head on, quickly enrolling for English lessons and landing her first job working as a seamstress in an East End factory, eventually setting up sewing classes and Somali dance groups that toured schools in east London. Over time Zahra’s charm and wit allowed her to get along famously with people of all backgrounds. As more Somali families began to settle in London, her home became a focal point for immigrants across six decades. She was always open to providing guidance and was a great confidante to all. Zahra’s home was full of friends from all ethnicities and walks of life. From shopkeepers to neighbours alike, people always looked forward to meeting her. In addition, she always gave generously to family and friends back home in Hargeisa. Omar died in 2020. She is survived by her seven children and 16 grandchildren.",News/World news,Zahra Jama obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/03/zahra-jama-obituary
