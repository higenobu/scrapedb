12/28/2021,"“The east is rising, the west is declining”, according to the narrative propagated by the Chinese Communist party (CCP). Many outside China take its “inevitable rise” as read. On the way to becoming a “modern socialist country” by 2035, and rich, powerful, and dominant by 2049, the centenary of the People’s Republic, China wants to claim bragging rights as its GDP surpasses the United States, and project its power based on its expanding economic heft.There is, however, a critical flaw in this narrative. China’s economy may fail to overtake the US as it succumbs to the proverbial middle-income trap. This is where the relative development progress of countries in relation to richer nations stalls, and is normally characterised by difficult economic adjustment and often by unpredictable political consequences.Historically, China’s growth miracle has been remarkable. In the 30 years to 1990. The money GDP (the market value of goods and services produced in an economy) for China and the US in American dollar terms grew more or less in tandem at just over 6% and 8% per annum, respectively. . But in the next three decades, China’s GDP growth doubled to over 13%, while America’s halved to 4.5%. That pushed China’s GDP up from 5% of American GDP to 66%.Yet, China’s growth spurt is now over, and the huge disparity in GDP growth has been eliminated. In the last few quarters, China’s GDP has been growing at half the rate of the US. Although that discrepancy is probably unsustainable, America’s $9tn GDP margin over China means that comparable rates of GDP growth in the future will sustain and even widen the margin. A Japanese thinktank has recently extended the date when it expects China to overtake the US, from 2029 to 2033. Deferrals like this are now a feature, and there will be more. Gross domestic product (GDP) measures the total value of activity in the economy over a given period of time.  Put simply, if GDP is up on the previous three months, the economy is growing; if it is down, it is contracting. Two or more consecutive quarters of contraction are considered to be a recession.  GDP is the sum of all goods and services produced in the economy, including the service sector, manufacturing, construction, energy, agriculture and government. Several key activities are not counted, such as unpaid work in the home.  The ONS uses three measures that should, in theory, add up to the same number. • The value of all goods and services produced – known as the output or production measure.• The value of the income generated from company profits and wages – known as the income measure.• The value of goods and services purchased by households, government, business (in terms of investment in machinery and buildings) and from overseas – known as the expenditure measure. Economists are concerned with the real rate of change of GDP, which accounts for how the economy is performing after inflation. Britain's government statistics body, the Office for National Statistics, produces GDP figures on a monthly basis about six weeks after the end of the month. It compares the change in GDP month on month, as well as over a three-month period.  The ONS warns that changes on the month can prove volatile, preferring to assess economic performance over a three-month period as the wider period can smooth over irregularities.  The most closely watched GDP figures are for the four quarters of the year; for the three months to March, June, September and December. The figures are usually revised in subsequent months as more data from businesses and the government becomes available.   The ONS also calculates the size of the UK economy relative to the number of people living here. GDP per capita shows whether we are actually getting richer or poorer, by stripping out the impact of population changes. Richard Partington  The issue though is less about the maths and more about why China is at a turning point.Remember we have been here before. In the 1930s, Germany was going to dominate Europe, if not the world. In the 1960s and the 1980s, the Soviet Union – which had already stolen a march on the US in space technology – and later Japan, which was the rising economic force on the planet, would within 10 to 20 years overtake America to become the dominant economic and technological power.History was not kind to the consensus. There is a serial tendency going back to the 1920s to underestimate the self-rectifying capacity of American institutions and enterprise. Equally, the Soviet Union and Japan both pursued similar development models, based around distortions that emphasised unsustainably and excessively high savings, high investment, and eventually high debt. Their development models cracked with spectacular consequences attributable to chronic failures of institutions and governance.China is our 21st-century version of this phenomenon. Its investment rate is a good 10 percentage points of GDP higher than it was at the peak in the USSR and Japan, and strongly associated with misallocation and inefficiency of capital, and widespread debt servicing problems.Its zero-Covid policy could keep barriers in place between China and the world economy until 2023 or even beyond, but this aside, a protracted slowing in trend growth, exacerbated by over-indebtedness and the tipping point now in real estate, as illustrated by the crumbling development giant Evergrande, is already underway. China’s $60tn real estate sector is four times GDP and accounts for a quarter to a third of annual growth. It faces years of awkward adjustment, not least as developers cut debt, the first-time buyer age cohort contracts, and probably as real estate prices decline.China’s economic structure, moreover, is unbalanced. It has income per head that is the equivalent of Mexico, but consumption per head that is no higher than Peru. Consumer spending accounts for about 37% of GDP, little higher than it was in 2010, and much lower than in 2000. Productivity growth, closely associated with liberalising reform, has stalled. China’s development model urgently needs a makeover to avoid the middle-income trap. The longer it is delayed, the bigger the costs. China’s leaders recognise that change is necessary, and Xi Jinping recently revived the slogan of “common prosperity” to mobilise the Communist party and citizens around a strategy to reduce income and regional inequality, and improve living standards.Yet these political goals require precisely the kind of liberalising, progressive and redistributive reforms to the economy to which Xi Jinping is opposed. He has pursued an increasingly ideological and totalitarian governance style in which the already dominant position of the party and state in the economy, has been strengthened further.Perversely, he has created a contradiction in which even the CCP’s expertise in dialectical argument may be of little help. The recent blizzard of new laws and regulations aimed at private firms and entrepreneurs, for example, is designed to nail down the part’s control and bring the private sector to political heel. This is hardly compatible with the productivity growth and innovation on which China’s lofty economic ambition depends.Overtaking the United States is going to need a lot more than narrative. It requires policies to which Xi’s China is opposed, and might just remain a mirage. The consequences for China and the rest of the world have not been properly thought about.

The Spain forward has signed a five-year contract at the Camp Nou that includes a buyout clause of €1bn. The overall fee could rise to €65m depending on the player’s achievements.  The 21-year-old has not featured for City since late September after injuring a foot on international duty but is fit again now. A tweet from City read: “Ferran Torres has left Manchester City and completed a permanent move to Barcelona.” Torres was a priority target for Barcelona’s manager, Xavi Hernández, particularly with the premature retirement of Sergio Agüero, who moved to the Camp Nou from City in the summer but managed only 339 minutes before suffering chest pains against Alavés in late October. Agüero confirmed his retirement this month due to a heart problem. City’s manager, Pep Guardiola, said he would not stand in the way of a player who wants to leave the club and having cost City €27m the sale to Barcelona represents good business.",Sport/Football,Ferran Torres completes €55m move to Barcelona from Manchester City,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/28/ferran-torres-completes-55m-move-to-barcelona-from-manchester-city
12/28/2021,"Man and Beast, as the Royal Academy’s winter blockbuster is subtitled, are the same thing when Francis Bacon is looking at them. They are both meat. The artist’s painted world is a butcher’s shop: slabs of beef hang vertically in his triptychs among umbrellas and swastikas, bisected beasts drained of blood, flattened into red and white fatty flesh. But the people in his paintings are just as beastly – and just as butchered. Bodies wrestle and kiss. Nudes are splayed on dirty mattresses. We are just biological stuff.  Bacon would surely have seen the irony that the Royal Academy’s survey of his art through the lens of his interest in animals has been delayed by a virus. For Bacon sees no hierarchy of organisms, no sacred specialness in the human species. When the exhibition finally opens at the end of January, it will unveil a truly Darwinian artist in whose eyes a pope and a chimpanzee are equally tragicomic. Bacon painted screaming, solitary apes in cages in the same years he depicted isolated anguished papal figures in glass booths. In 1957’s Study for Chimpanzee, the animal looks like a sad prelate, sulking in the corner of a zoo enclosure. In the 1940s and 50s, when he defined his vision and established his fame, he also painted dogs, elephants and owls. To visit a zoo is to experience a Francis Bacon theme park. Apes, monkeys and birds of prey are isolated for observation behind bars, mesh or glass, provided with swings and dead branches just as Bacon’s people are given weird items of tubular-steel furniture in their claustrophobic orange or pink rooms. Bacon grew up close to nature. His father bet on, and tried to breed, horses. Young Francis had early sexual encounters with the grooms in his father’s stables. There were also plenty of dogs in this minor-aristocratic country house milieu. Bacon had siblings who settled in colonial Africa, where he went on holiday. Big game fascinated him. He started collecting books on African wildlife as a teenager and one of his most surprising paintings, Elephant Fording a River from 1952, is a tender portrayal of a big mammal dwarfed by a vast shadowy wilderness. Yet Bacon is a ruthless student of the human condition, not a sentimental nature artist. His studies of animals are essentially fodder for his art of ideas. By approaching him through his menagerie of symbols, Man and Beast invites us to focus on Bacon’s grand, scary vision of life and death. After sitting next to JMW Turner at a dinner, John Constable praised his “wonderful range of mind”. Bacon, the most important British artist since Turner, shared that big bold mentality. And he used animals to build his personal mythology of the perverse. The creatures who howl and crouch in his 1944 triptych Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion are part chicken, part owl, part dog – and all human. We are no longer angels created in God’s image, Bacon tells the war generation. The Royal Academy show features his 1988 painting, Second Version of Triptych 1944, that rams the point home for a new age. It was painted in the year Damien Hirst staged the group show Freeze that launched the Young British Artists and a year before the Berlin Wall fell, as if to insist that his vision of brutish gargoyles is as pertinent as long as humans exist. We are not holy. We are base. Monsters are what happen when humans and animals interbreed. Egyptian and Greek art created jackal-headed and horse-bodied beings that represent states between human distinctness and the impulses we share with our fellow animals. Bacon too, is an artist of myth. He set out to create a post-religious mythology of modern life, portraying people whose skin is like elephant hide, who crouch like apes and have sex like dogs. In Figure Study II, painted in 1945-6, a naked and partly formed man turns a face with no upper half towards us. From his comparisons of human and animal anatomy – including Eadweard Muybridge’s photographs of animals and humans in motion – Bacon creates a new, mutant Frankensteinian nature. Only the greatest artists can get away with such visions. The reason Bacon’s art doesn’t collapse into melodramatic pretension is that he exactly observes details of life, and renders it in richly decadent, bravura paint that is as satisfying as it is disturbing. By the 1960s he was ready to take on the other great animal artist of the 20th century. He started painting bullfights even though the corrida “belonged” to Pablo Picasso. Bacon’s bullfight happens in a room, of course. As 1991’s Study of a Bull reveals, Bacon could also look at animals alone, peaceful, existing for themselves. He never portrayed a person so tranquilly.

12/28/2021,"Shortages of lateral flow tests (LFTs) and lack of walk-in test slots across England are threatening to undermine the government’s plans for New Year’s Eve celebrations to go ahead unimpeded. Pharmacies across England report having run out of test kits for distribution to the public before Christmas, and have been unable to receive additional kits as the supply chain has been disrupted by the Christmas and Boxing Day holidays.  Some community pharmacies in rural areas said they had not received deliveries of LFTs since early last week, although many remained closed on Monday and Tuesday because of the extended bank holidays. People turning to the NHS website were also out of luck: on Tuesday morning it said no delivery slots for LFTs were available, for the second day in a row. The NHS site also indicated that there were no walk-in LFT or PCR tests available anywhere in England on Tuesday morning. But by early afternoon the site was indicating availability of tests in most parts of England. The UK Health Security Agency said it encouraged people to revisit the sites “every few hours” if they were unable to order tests, as more would become available, and to use any tests they may already have before ordering or collecting more kits. A spokesperson said: “Despite unprecedented demand, we are continuing to supply millions of rapid lateral flow tests every day. Our total delivery capacity has doubled to 900,000 test kits per day since Saturday 18 December so more people can order tests. “During periods of exceptional demand there may be temporary pauses in ordering or receiving tests, to ensure we manage distribution across the system and support changing requirements for LFD [lateral flow device] and PCR tests, and delivery capacity was reduced over Christmas and the bank holiday.” Tests were available in all regions of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, according to the site. On Monday the government declined to impose further Covid curbs in England, allowing nightclubs and pubs to open for New Year’s Eve and giving other mass events the go-ahead. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, said; “Of course people should remain cautious as we approach new year celebrations and take a lateral flow test if that makes sense.” Covid cases in England reached a new high of 113,628 on Christmas Day, and 1,281 people were admitted to hospital, the highest daily figure since mid-February. Official data on new Covid cases, which was delayed over the festive period, also showed 98,515 new confirmed cases reported in England on Monday. Data for Boxing Day from England and Wales combined revealed 108,893 new cases reported. Case numbers have also hit new highs in Scotland, where 8,252 cases were reported for Christmas Day, 11,030 on Boxing Day and 10,562 on Monday. Demand for tests has soared during the Christmas holiday period, with positive test results reaching record levels in England as the Omicron variant continues to spread rapidly. Demand further increased last week after the government cut the self-isolation period for England from 10 to seven days for those with negative LFT results on day six and seven. The 10-day self-isolation period remains in force in Wales and Scotland. Pharmacies are limited to receiving one carton of tests a day. The Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee said its members were struggling to meet demand, and asked for the public to be patient with pharmacists, who were working extremely hard over the Christmas period.",News/World news,Covid test shortages threaten New Year’s Eve celebrations in England,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/28/covid-test-shortages-threaten-new-years-eve-celebrations-in-england
12/28/2021,"At least 18 peaceful environmental protesters have been sent to prison this year, with 10 spending Christmas Day behind bars. As concern about the climate crisis grows, activists have been jailed for blocking roads, disrupting court proceedings and in one case climbing on top of an aeroplane in an attempt to draw attention to the escalating emergency.  Campaigners fear their “heavy-handed treatment” is part of a concerted effort by the state to crack down on the right to protest, with the government’s controversial police, crime, sentencing and courts bill criticised by human rights activists as “a dangerous power grab”. Ten members of the environmental protest group Insulate Britain spent Christmas serving prison sentences for contempt of court for breaching injunctions banning their road block protests, which demanded the proper insulation of the UK’s housing stock. Seven more have suspended sentences. At least eight other environmental activists have served prison sentences in 2021 for contempt of court actions, according to Extinction Rebellion, including livestreaming from court and gluing themselves to the dock. Six activists who occupied a tunnel close to Euston station in London in protest against the HS2 high-speed rail link earlier this year narrowly avoided a jail sentence after charges were dismissed by a judge. The jailed Insulate Britain protesters have sent unrepentant messages from behind bars. “Locked in my cell for twenty-three and a half hours each day, I miss my family, I miss my friends, I miss nature,” said Oliver Roc, 41, who is serving a four-month sentence at HMP Thameside in south-east London. “But when I think about the future we are facing I feel a deep conviction that [what] we have done is right, that this is the best place.” In a campaign of disruptive protests that began on 13 September, Insulate Britain activists blocked major roads in and around London, at the port of Dover, in Manchester and in Birmingham on 19 different occasions. Their tactics angered motorists and were fiercely criticised, with politicians calling the protesters selfish. The activists vowed to continue until the government agreed to a programme of insulating all Britain’s draughty and energy-inefficient homes by 2030 – or until they were sent to prison. The latest to be jailed was Dr Diana Warner, 62, a retired GP from Bristol. After a spree of activism, including being found not guilty over a 2019 Extinction Rebellion action at Canary Wharf, and then skipping her contempt of court trial to block a train headed for the Drax power station in North Yorkshire, Warner said she was finally sleeping well. “The first thing I think about is no longer the climate and environment emergency because I know I’ve done my best and can take a bit of a breather,” she told the Guardian from HMP Bronzefield in Ashford, Surrey. “Being in prison for climate activism seems very odd. But in such a disjointed world it feels to me like the right place to be.” Ben Taylor, 26, is serving the longest sentence. He was jailed for six months after telling judges if they freed him he would “go out and block the highway at the earliest opportunity” and would keep doing it until the government acts. He said life at Thameside was mostly boring. “I was treated a bit rough at first, made to feel alienated, vulnerable and powerless, but I’m on a good wing now and have made a few friends. It’s really not that bad for me.” James Brown, the Paralympian released this month after being jailed for gluing himself to a plane in an XR action in 2019, said it was important for those spending Christmas in prison to remember they had “done the right thing”. Brown, who spent 10 weeks in Wandsworth prison in London, said: “It is tough for them and their families at Christmas but it is necessary ... Most of the positive, radical changes we have seen have come about because of peaceful protest and civil disobedience and that is what we need to tackle the climate and ecological crisis. In the end, if you are not resisting then you are complicit.” Emmanuelle Andrews, the policy and campaigns manager at the human rights group Liberty, said: “Protest is not a gift from the state, it’s a fundamental right, and one that has been attacked for years by a government that wants to make itself untouchable. The heavy-handed treatment – both by police and the government – of protesters over the past year follows a long-term trend seen for several years from a government that has sought to threaten protesters into silence. “The government and police already have extensive powers to detain and criminalise protesters. But the policing bill is an attempt to take this even further. It is an attack on the rights of everyone who has a cause they believe in, from climate activists to grieving families looking for answers and justice.”",News/Environment,At least 18 peaceful environmental protesters jailed in UK this year,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/28/at-least-18-peaceful-environmental-protesters-jailed-in-uk-this-year
