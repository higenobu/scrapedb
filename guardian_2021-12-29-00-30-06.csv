12/29/2021,"The tale of Stripe the squirrel began cheerfully enough with Corrine Reynolds, an animal lover in north Wales, feeding the creature titbits and watching its acrobatic adventures in her back garden. But the story took a distinctly unfestive twist when Stripe – named after the sharp-toothed creature in the Christmas horror comedy Gremlins – began nipping at Reynolds and other neighbours.  After the grey squirrel bit more than a dozen people in the town of Buckley, Flintshire, drawing blood on several occasions, Reynolds caught it in a humane trap and had the animal taken away by the RSPCA. Reynolds, a 65-year-old carer, began feeding Stripe in the summer and for months it made regular trips to her garden, but then it began to bite the hand that fed it. She reported what had happened on a local social media group page and was shocked at how many others said they too had been bitten. “In the space of 48 hours he attacked 18 people,” she said. “He started attacking people who are just taking their recycling bags to the bin, and they are quite gruesome injuries.” One neighbour, Scott Felton, 34, said he had been having a cigarette at his back door when the squirrel pounced. “This squirrel came out of nowhere, jumped on to my arm and bit me on my hand before I even had chance to get it off – it all happened so quick.” He went to hospital for a tetanus jab. Another victim, Sheree Robinson, 42, who was bitten on her finger, said: “He had five or six of my neighbours. He had me when collecting my recycling bags. He jumped out from behind my green bin. It had me good and proper. I’ve got teeth marks on the top and bottom of my finger. It latched on and I had to shake it off.” Another resident said Stripe had attacked her two Bengal cats, who usually feared nothing, and admitted she did not go out of her house when the squirrel was lurking. Reynolds felt she had to take action and bought a humane trap to catch Stripe. The RSPCA came and picked the squirrel up, transferring it from her cage to theirs in her bathroom to stop it from escaping. There is no happy ending. The RSPCA said it had no choice but to put Stripe down as it is illegal to release a grey squirrel back into the wild. An RSPCA spokesperson said: “We were incredibly sad to have to put this squirrel to sleep but were left with no choice due to changes in legislation in 2019 making it illegal to release grey squirrels back into the wild. We do not agree with this law and opposed it, but legally we have to comply.” It said there were ways to humanely deter grey squirrels, such as keeping bird food away from them and blocking access points, and it urged people not to trap them. The charity does not suggest that people do not feed squirrels but asks them to think about whether it could cause problems in the neighbourhood and points out that they are very good at finding their own food. The British Pest Control Association says it is very rare for squirrels to bite humans, but if they do it can be a deep wound and medical advice should be sought. Reynolds said she was sad for Stripe but there was relief in the neighbourhood. “I feel it is now safe to go in my garden. I did feel incredibly harsh doing what I did by putting it in a cage, but when people didn’t feel safe in their garden, I had to do it. A few people in Buckley are certainly breathing a sigh of relief.”",News/UK news,Stripe the bitey squirrel meets a sad end after terrorising Welsh town,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/28/stripe-the-bitey-squirrel-meets-a-sad-end-after-terrorising-welsh-town
12/29/2021,"Donald Trump has claimed 5,000 dead people voted in 2020 in Georgia, a key state he lost to Joe Biden on his way to national defeat.  He was off by 4,996. As the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported on Monday, state officials have confirmed four cases of dead people voting. All involved family members submitting votes for the deceased, cases in which the state has the power to levy fines. In one case detailed by the paper, a widow submitted an absentee ballot for her husband after he died in September, two months before polling day. An attorney for the 74-year-old woman reportedly told officials her husband “was going to vote Republican, and she said, ‘Well, I’m going to cancel your ballot because I’m voting Democrat.’ It was kind of a joke between them. She received the absentee ballot and carried out his wishes. “She now realises that was not the thing to do.” Even if Trump’s claim about dead voters were true, it would not have saved him from being the first Republican to lose Georgia since 1992. Biden won the state by nearly 12,000 votes. Nor could Georgia alone have overturned Trump’s electoral college defeat, by 306-232. But Trump included his claim in a notorious call in which he pushed the Georgia secretary of state, Republican Brad Raffensperger, to “find” enough votes to give him victory. “Dead people,” Trump said. “So dead people voted, and I think the number is close to 5,000 people. And they went to obituaries. They went to all sorts of methods to come up with an accurate number, and a minimum is close to about 5,000 voters.” He also claimed that “a tremendous number of dead people” voted in Michigan, adding: “I think it was … 18,000. Some unbelievably high number, much higher than yours, you were in the 4-5,000 category.” Referring to a claim of “upward of 5,000” dead voters he said was presented to Georgia officials, Raffensperger, said: “The actual number were two. Two. Two people that were dead that voted. So that’s wrong.” Trump insisted: “In one state, we have a tremendous amount of dead people. So I don’t know – I’m sure we do in Georgia, too. I’m sure we do in Georgia, too.” Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, told Raffensperger: “You say they were only two dead people who would vote. I can promise you there are more than that.” Raffensperger refused to help Trump, prompting threats to his safety. But the call also placed Trump in legal jeopardy, as a district attorney investigates whether he broke electoral law. The call was part of scattershot attempts to overturn a defeat Trump insists in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary was the result of electoral fraud. A few days after the call, on 6 January, Trump told supporters in Washington to “fight like hell” in his cause. Rioters then attacked the US Capitol, seeking to stop certification of Biden’s win, in some cases seeking to capture or kill officials including Trump’s vice-president, Mike Pence. Five people died.",News/US news,"Georgia debunks Trump claim that 5,000 dead people voted in 2020",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/28/donald-trump-georgia-2020-election-dead-people
12/29/2021,"The US has announced it is cutting the recommended self-isolation time with Covid to five days. How long are people with Covid infectious for, and why do the rules vary between countries? What are the rules for self-isolation in the UK?  Since 22 December, people in England who have tested positive for Covid have been allowed to cut their self-isolation from 10 days to seven if they have negative lateral flow tests on days six and day seven. Fully vaccinated close contacts of someone who has tested positive do not need to self-isolate, but those who are not vaccinated have to isolate for 10 days. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the self-isolation period for those who test positive remains 10 days. How long is someone with Covid infectious for? It has been clear for some time that people can be infectious from about two days before they develop symptoms. Estimates for how long an infected person remains contagious vary, but as Harvard Medical School notes: “By the 10th day after Covid symptoms begin, most people will no longer be contagious, as long as their symptoms have continued to improve and their fever has resolved.” Dr Julian Tang, a professor of respiratory sciences at the University of Leicester, said although the Omicron variant showed some escape from vaccine-induced and past immunity, he would expect the immune response to follow a similar timeline to that in previous variants. However, Prof Lawrence Young, a virologist at Warwick Medical School, said it appeared that the time from infection to becoming infectious was shorter with the Omicron variant, at two or three days, and it was very likely that the infectious period was also shorter and probably affected by vaccination status. “This infectious period can occur before the onset of symptoms and last for between two to three days after you become symptomatic,” he said. The UK Health Security Agency says the new approach for England “reflects latest evidence on how long cases transmit the virus for, and supports essential public services and supply chains over the winter, while still limiting the spread of the virus”. Dr Richard Tedder, a member of the Clinical Virology Network, said the shift was a compromise, and was based on the assumption that people with two negative tests are unlikely to transmit coronavirus to contacts. “On a balance of probabilities this is probably correct,” he said, although he suggested the situation may be different for some people, such as those who are immunosuppressed, and it may not hold if future variants are not picked up by lateral flow tests. Young agreed. “The approach adopted in the UK is sensible based on seven days and two consecutive negative lateral flow tests. These tests are a great way to determine if you are infectious.” How do the UK’s rules compare with those of other countries? In France, people with Covid must self-isolate for 10 days, while in Germany the mandatory self-isolation period is 14 days unless a PCR test comes back negative or the local health office confirms release. In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recently cut the recommended self-isolation period to just five days provided the person has no symptoms at that point. “The change is motivated by science demonstrating that the majority of transmission occurs early in the course of illness, generally in the one to two days prior to onset of symptoms and the two to three days after,” the CDC said. “Therefore, people who test positive should isolate for five days and, if asymptomatic at that time, they may leave isolation if they can continue to mask for five days to minimise the risk of infecting others.” Close contacts of positive cases are also recommended to isolate for five days, followed by strict mask-wearing, although those who have had their booster jabs or have recently completed the primary course of Covid vaccines do not need to self-isolate but should wear a mask around others for 10 days. Tang said the approach was essentially following the same 10-day isolation cut-off that the World Health Organization proposed last summer. “But they are also taking into account the viral load drop-off after the first five days, with five days of masking to follow,” he said. Whether it was sufficient would depend, he said, on how conscientiously masks were worn during that period to limit further transmission as the viral load drops. “It’s just another compromise as we learn to accept and live with this virus,” Tang said. “Different countries will approach this differently based on their local knowledge, studies, experience, and competing resources and priorities.” However, some experts, including Young, have raised concerns over the shift in rules in the US, noting there is no requirement for a negative Covid test before ending self-isolation. Dr Michael Mina, an assistant professor at Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, noted that some people stay infectious for 12 days. “CDC’s new guidance to drop isolation of positives to five days without a negative test is reckless,” he tweeted. “I absolutely don’t want to sit next to someone who turned Positive 5 days ago and hasn’t tested [negative].”",News/World news,How long are people infectious for with Covid and how do isolation rules vary?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/28/how-long-are-people-infectious-for-with-covid-and-how-do-isolation-rules-vary
12/29/2021,"Nothing good happens in the morning. As far as I’m concerned, we would be better off without them. While the larks among us are attempting to #seizetheday with meditation or punishing exercise, my mornings are usually spent waiting for the caffeine to kick in and overcome the bleary-eyed anxiety. In 2021, lockdown and the lingering disappointment of a cancelled Christmas made winter mornings even more unbearable. For about eight weeks, from Blue Monday to the middle of March, I owed my fragile sanity to one man: Radio 1 DJ Greg James. The world is never darker than when you have just woken up alone, but listening to his nice-lad nattering as my brain began to whirr genuinely gave me hope that the world was a friendlier place than it seemed through the frosted glass of my bedroom window. “I always feel a little bad when people say thanks for cheering me up, because it cheers me up throwing myself into work,” says James, whose show has more than 4 million listeners. “It’s really saved me, particularly over the last two years.”  As host of Britain’s most iconic, if not necessarily most popular, radio show (that title belongs to Zoe Ball), James readily admits that broadcasting to an anxious nation, often from an empty office, has been more than he bargained for. “It became a much more serious job than I ever hoped it would,” he says. “But then, when I took over, I did think about how it’s weirdly quite a responsible position. Trying to get the tone right has been a bigger challenge than ever, but this is not the 90s – Chris Evans [could] go out and get pissed every night.” James recalls his uncertainty on the day of Boris Johnson’s initial lockdown announcement. “I didn’t know how it would go the next day. There’s no handbook really: ‘Open the pandemic book and turn to page five,’” he bellows, with the perfect diction of one of his 1940s predecessors. They explored retreating into a pop-insulated bunker of inoffensiveness and leaving the serious stuff to the likes of Adam Fleming, Fergus Walsh and Laura Kuenssberg. “My brief has always been to try to make the day go quicker and distract people from what’s going on,” he says. But ploughing on as though nothing had changed ran the risk of appearing tone-deaf. “It’s been a bigger challenge than ever. You don’t want to be ‘too fun’ when people are anxious or sad.” It’s this quality that won me over. Prior to lockdown, I found the relentless pep of morning radio insulting; the crater between the way I felt and the way they sounded only compounded the morning blues. James’s show found another gear: breakfast radio as bulletin, breakfast radio as companion, breakfast radio as lifeline. “We tried to remove any sort of barrier of ‘I’m a radio presenter and you’re listening’,” he says. “It felt more natural to say: ‘It’s OK that I feel terrified, and you feel terrified; we’re going to try to muddle through it together. There are shitty jokes, but it became a safe space away from the rolling news coverage … Maybe one day I’d like to be a therapist!” Aside from the small matter of his weekday programme, James took on a bevy of lockdown projects to keep himself busy through the winter. Not least, growing out his hair in homage to Jake “hair goals” Gyllenhaal, much to the delight of his wife, the author Bella Mackie: “She says I must never cut my hair short again!” James also wrote a children’s book with Chris Smith, The Great Dream Robbery, which he describes as “all about imagination – dreaming your way out of a nightmare … It doesn’t take a genius to see we wrote that when we were feeling trapped but it was another great excuse to get out of my own head.” Lockdown also provided the space for James to complete his passion project, a seven-part podcast series for BBC Sounds, Sport’s Strangest Crimes, about Allen Stanford, the Texas billionaire and Ponzi-schemer who scandalised the sporting world after buying his way into the cricket establishment. “It’s something that I would like to do more of,” he says of the forensic new lane he has found in the pandemic. Despite the podcast’s success, James has no plans to depart the breakfast show anytime soon. “You’d be silly not to want to do the biggest show,” he adds, reiterating his commitment to the job. “During the pandemic, it became a crutch for a lot of people. I trust the listeners more than ever and they trust me back. It’s been a great experience doing shows where you have to judge the mood of the nation and set up the rest of the day.” Recent weeks have seen an increase in Covid anxiety that is eerily reminiscent of this time last year. I expect I will be leaning on James to get me through another winter. “Yeah, lots of things are happening now but we’re still having to balance that with people being anxious, or unsure about what they can and can’t do safely,” he says. “It’s taken on a whole new life [in the pandemic] – but I quite like the challenge of a Tuesday morning in February.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,The person who got me through 2021: Greg James made bad pandemic mornings bearable,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/28/the-person-who-got-me-through-2021-greg-james-made-bad-pandemic-mornings-bearable
12/29/2021,"The two images are as stark as what they represent: the cause and effect of Haiti’s increasing woes. In one, a masked and armed gangster keeps lookout on a Port-au-Prince rooftop, just a few blocks from the presidential palace. In the other, a family recently displaced by gang violence takes shelter in a school that now houses dozens of families, a stone’s throw from their homes. “Port-au-Prince is almost entirely controlled by gangs, and we wanted to show the efforts of people that are running businesses to survive,” says Rodrigo Abd, 45, an Argentinian staff photographer with the Associated Press who took the images. “But I was also trying to show another side to Haiti, to avoid the stereotypes that we always repeat, to show the violent without the violence, or the poor without the poverty.”  Haiti is beset by overlapping crises. The country’s president, Jovenel Moïse, was assassinated in early July in circumstances that remain mysterious. A 7.2 magnitude earthquake wrecked the country’s rural south in August. In September, thousands of Haitian migrants that had been living across South America were deported from Texas after years away from their homeland. Meanwhile, in the political vacuum, local rights groups estimate that as many as 165 gangs continue to terrorise residents, throwing up roadblocks and kidnapping rich and poor alike for ransom. Aid deliveries to the quake-struck south are often turned back by militiamen, who in October kidnapped a group of 17 US and Canadian missionary workers and their families. Over 600 people have been kidnapped in Haiti this year, over triple last year’s total. Fuel shortages have added to the woes, especially in a country without a reliable electrical grid. “You can feel an aggressive landscape, that it is a place that could explode very easily and at any time, because the situation is so bad,” says Abd, who has photographed war zones around the world. Abd has worked several times in Haiti, travelling to the Caribbean country first in 2004, just before the coup that removed then-president Jean-Bertrand Aristide from office in another wave of instability. Aristide had empowered local gangs to implement his will in the poorer neighbourhoods, and some of the groups operating today trace their roots to his presidency. “Here, now we are back to what it was in those days, where in some communities, neither the police nor any other type of law enforcement institution can enter, and therefore the population becomes hostages to the armed gangs,” says Fiammetta Cappellini, the Haiti representative for international charity AVSI. “Having no other point of reference, the people develop a sort of cohabitation with the gangs that have become the authority running the neighbourhood.” Despite the menacing pose of the masked gangster on a rooftop terrace in Abd’s image, the photographer saw a similar desperation to that of the terrorised residents. “Most of those people that we interviewed said that being in a gang was just a way of survival,” says Abd, adding that he had hoped to photograph gang members without masks, though met steadfast refusal. “It was very difficult to understand the story from outside; we spent three weeks trying to understand, and talking to gang members to understand why they were trying to contest territory and fight the government.” “My impression was that they are almost normal guys who put on the mask and pick up the gun when they need to defend territory or extort someone, or kidnap someone,” says Abd. “I think that if the situation improves, they may even go back to being normal citizens. “It’s not only a story that has been going on for the last two or three years, but one that is getting worse now,” he says. “There’s a relationship between the gangs, the city, and the people that are always having to move from one place to another.” Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",News/Global development,‘It could explode at any time’: photographing Haiti’s gang warfare,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/dec/28/it-could-explode-at-any-time-photographing-haitis-gang-warfare
12/29/2021,"After the turmoil of the past two years, the consensus among economic pundits is that 2022 will be calmer. But in late 2019, when the first reports of a new strain of the coronavirus started to filter out from Wuhan in China, few imagined within months that the world economy would be flattened by a pandemic. So what are the big risks for the coming year?  It is too early to say how serious the Omicron strain of the virus will prove to be but it has already put paid to hopes that life was about to return to pre-pandemic normality. Consumers have not needed to be instructed to obey restrictions; often they have tempered their own behaviour. A return to full-scale lockdowns would have much more severe consequences. Dhaval Joshi, an economist at BCA Research says more and more variants will emerge and one of them will spell trouble. The danger from a variant comes from three properties: its contagiousness; its ability to evade vaccines and natural immunity; and the severity of the disease that it causes, he says. “The big issue is not whether the omicron variant is a “super-variant”. The big issue is that, eventually, a new variant will be a “super-variant”. The unexpected pick up in price pressures has been one of the big stories of 2021. The Bank of England, the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank were all caught unawares by a sharp increase in inflation, caused by a combination of rising energy prices, labour shortages and supply-side bottlenecks. The Bank of England expects the annual increase in the cost of living to be above 5% by next April but then start to fall. But central banks will face some tricky decisions if inflation proves more ingrained than they envisage. Just before Christmas Saxo bank came up with its 10 “outrageous” predictions of unlikely but under-appreciated events for 2022 and one of them was that of a wage-price spiral in the US sending inflation in the world’s biggest economy above 15%. Even a much more modest rise would cause the Fed to tighten policy aggressively. For years there has been speculation that the world’s second biggest economy is about to have a severe economic downturn and it hasn’t happened. But legacy problems have now started to fuse with current difficulties to whip up what could prove a perfect storm. Problems from the past are exemplified by Beijing’s attempts to manage the failure of the property company Evergrande, and prevent its problems infecting the entire economy. Along with many other companies in the sector, Evergrande expanded when Beijing loosened policy and ran into trouble when the authorities took steps to deal with the economy overheating. China has taken a no-risk approach to Covid-19 and has been central to the global economy’s supply-side problems. As the economy has cooled, the nationalist rhetoric from Xi Jinping has been ramped up, particularly towards Taiwan. Economics and geo-politics threaten to collide in 2022. The 30% drop in the Turkish lira in November alone has alerted financial markets to the dangers of a crisis in emerging markets. In truth, most of Turkey’s problems are country-specific, caused by the unorthodox approach to monetary policy of Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Currency dealers have been unimpressed by Erdoğan’s insistence that the way to cope with soaring inflation is to cut interest rates. Faith in the other big emerging market economy viewed as high-risk – Argentina – is also in short supply. There is, though, a more systemic issue, which is that many emerging markets have borrowed heavily in US dollars often using future export earnings as collateral. In the event that the US Federal Reserve tightens policy, the dollar is likely to strengthen, making it more expensive for poorer nations to service their debts. If the global economy also slows, they will face a double whammy. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are already warning of increased debt distress. Asset prices – shares, bonds and property – have all risen since the initial sell-off at the start of the pandemic. Rock-bottom interest rates and the flooding of financial markets with money created by quantitative easing programmes have made it cheaper to move home and to borrow money for speculative activity. Asset prices have also been boosted by the message sent out from central banks that any tightening of policy will be limited and gradual. But economies have started to slow after a period of catch-up growth in the aftermath of lockdowns. The risk is that despite weaker activity central banks are forced into more drastic monetary policy action by higher-than-expected inflation, thereby kicking away the prop that has been supporting richly valued assets.",News/Business,Five economic flashpoints to beware in 2022,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/28/happy-new-year-five-economic-flashpoints-to-beware-in-2022
12/29/2021,"An effective and widely available treatment for Covid would be a major breakthrough for managing the pandemic, but two antivirals recently authorized in the US come with some significant caveats, including low supply and use only among those at high risk for severe illness and death. Paxlovid from Pfizer and molnupiravir from Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics were authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last week. The pills could be a game-changer for the most vulnerable, because they can be taken at home twice a day for five days to prevent hospitalization and death. For those considered at high risk of serious illness, Paxlovid was found to be 89% effective when taken within the first three days of symptoms and 88% effective in the first five days.  Andrew Pekosz, professor of microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, described the pills as “very promising”. “There is an important role for these in terms of limiting severe disease,” Pekosz said “It’s just going to be a challenge to use them effectively.” Those challenges include the fact that supplies of the Pfizer treatment are very limited, while the Merck treatment is less effective than hoped. And the pills aren’t for everyone. Both treatments will only be given to people at high risk of being hospitalized or dying from Covid-19, which were the populations studied in the clinical trials. The Merck treatment will not be given to children or pregnant people. Pfizer’s pills aren’t recommended for those with liver or kidney issues, and it may cause other medications to work differently during the treatment course. There’s also the issue of access. The pills must be taken as soon as possible after a positive test – and tests can be difficult to find in some of the hardest-hit places, with results often taking days to return. The treatments are also only available by prescription from a doctor or health worker, limiting those who can get hold of it. And only 65,000 courses of the more effective Pfizer treatment will become available this month, with another 200,000 courses arriving in January amid an anticipated surge of hundreds of thousands of cases as the Omicron variant spreads. Washington DC, for instance, will only receive enough for 120 people despite having the highest rate of new cases in the country. “It’s going to be very, very limited in terms of being able to find it,” Pekosz said. And those shortages are likely to persist in the short term. The antivirals are complex to create and it will take six to eight months to ramp up production, with Pfizer expecting to make 120m courses of the treatment in 2022. The US government pre-ordered 10m courses of Pfizer’s treatment and 3m n of Merck’s. Like the vaccines and monoclonal antibodies, government-purchased antivirals will be given for free. Beyond supply, another challenge of Paxlovid will be drug-to-drug interactions. Not all medications are affected, but certain ones – some heart medications and blood thinners, for example, as well as herbal supplements like St John’s wort – could be affected by the treatment. Those who receive the Pfizer medication will need to work closely with their doctors to monitor these medication interactions. The Merck treatment will be more widely available at first, but it only reduced hospitalization by 30% among high-risk patients. “That was not a magic pill for sure,” said Peter Anderson, a professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of Colorado. The Merck treatment is only for adults, because it could interfere with bone and cartilage growth in children. It’s also not recommended for pregnant people, because animal studies showed there could be some effects on the fetus. Men who want to start a family should wait 90 days after the treatment, Anderson said. “This drug works by introducing mutations and errors in that replication of the genetic material, and the concern is that it could potentially be the same thing for replication of genetic material in gametes, or sperm and new embryos,” Anderson said. Molnupiravir will be used as an additional tool that is “limited to situations where other FDA-authorized treatments for Covid are inaccessible or are not clinically appropriate,” Cavazzoni said. Other treatments for Covid are likely to follow. On the same day the Pfizer treatment was authorized, a study on remdesivir published in the New England Journal of Medicine found the three-day antiviral is highly effective at avoiding hospitalization and death if given early in the course of illness. The US government is also ordering more sotrovimab, the monoclonal antibodies from GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology that work against the Omicron variant. The last order of sotrovimab recently shipped, but the US is ordering 1m more doses, with 300,000 to be made available in January. Treatments for Covid should be used in addition to vaccines, not in place of them, the experts stressed. They are particularly important for people who can’t be vaccinated or who don’t mount a good response to vaccines, such as the immune-compromised and the elderly. Pekosz worries that patients will have unrealistic expectations of the antivirals. “We’ve got to be clear to people what their expectations are. These drugs are going to keep people out of the hospital. They’re not going to make you feel better the next day as you take it. They’re not going to shorten your symptoms,” he said. “It’s just going to keep you out of the hospital – an incredibly important thing for the high-risk groups,” Pekosz said, providing “one more weapon to help reduce the amount of disease severity, hospitalizations and deaths resulting from Covid-19.” These medications should work well against omicron and other new variants, because unlike vaccines, they don’t target the part of the virus that tends to evolve. There have been some concerns that Merck’s drug, which works by forcing the virus to mutate until it’s no longer effective, could drive the emergence of new variants. But experts believe this is unlikely. “It’s really as if the antiviral drug is just taking a hammer to multiple parts of the virus and breaking multiple parts of the viral genome,” Pekosz said. In fact, molnupiravir was named for Mjölnir, Thor’s mythical hammer. “So the risk for mutations that result in other variants of concern emerging from people who are on these drugs is probably minimal.” But Pekosz is concerned the virus could evolve to be resistant to these treatments, as has happened with some monoclonal antibodies and, in one study, remdesivir. Giving a mix of different drugs, instead of just one kind of antiviral, would probably prevent resistance, he said. “That’s a place where the federal government may be able to really step in and broker some deals across pharmaceutical companies, to get them to work together to make multi-drug cocktails,” Pekosz said. In the meantime, the treatments represent a “very important step forward”, Anderson said. “Now you’ve got a really effective treatment for those people that we worry about the most.” If at-risk people are able to access the treatments quickly, “before the virus has a chance to take hold, you can basically shut down replication,” he said. “You can save that person … It’s a big deal.”",News/US news,Covid pills are ‘very promising’ – but what are the challenges in using them?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/28/covid-pills-challenges-paxlovid-molnupiravir
12/29/2021,"A leading video game maker, Riot Games, has agreed to pay $100m (£74m) to settle a gender discrimination lawsuit with California state agencies and more than 2,000 current and former female employees. Under the agreement, the company, which makes games including League of Legends, will pay $80m to members of the 2018 class action suit and about $20m towards legal fees.  The settlement is awaiting final approval, which is expected at a hearing at a Los Angeles court in the next few months. The California state civil rights agency, the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH), hailed a “historic agreement” which it said would send a powerful signal to the gaming industry and others. Kevin Kish, the director of the DFEH, said: “If entered by the court, this decree will compensate employees and contractors affected by sex discrimination and harassment, ensure lasting change in this workplace, and send the message that all industries in California, including the gaming industry, must provide equal pay and workplaces free from discrimination and harassment.” The lawsuit, which was followed by two inquiries by California state agencies, was filed by female employees more than three years ago. It alleged gender discrimination, unequal pay, harassment and retaliation. “I am so glad we achieved this first step toward justice for the women of Riot Games,” said Jes Negron, a plaintiff. “I hope this case serves as an example for other studios and an inspiration for women in the industry at large. Women in gaming do not have to suffer inequity and harassment in silence – change is possible.” Genie Harrison, an employment and sexual harassment lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said: “This is a great day for the women of Riot Games – and for women at all video game and tech companies – who deserve a workplace that is free of harassment and discrimination.” As part of the settlement, the company agreed to workplace reforms including monitoring by a third party for three years, pay transparency and “limiting subjectivity and implicit bias in hiring and selection processes”. Riot Games agreed to settle the suit in 2019 for $10m but the agreement was blocked by the DFEH, which argued in a court filing that victims should be entitled to up to $400m. In a statement on Monday, Riot Games, which is owned by the Chinese internet company Tencent, said: “In an effort to drive ongoing transparency and accountability, Riot has also committed to having its internal reporting and pay equity processes monitored by a third party jointly approved by Riot and the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing for three years.” In an email to employees seen by the Washington Post, five company executives responded to the settlement. “We want to acknowledge that the timing of this announcement isn’t ideal,” they reportedly wrote. “The final details of the agreement came together quickly, and we wanted you to hear about it from us directly rather than read about it in the news while on break.”",Arts/Games,Riot Games to pay $100m to settle gender discrimination lawsuit,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/dec/28/riot-games-to-pay-100m-to-settle-gender-discrimination-lawsuit
