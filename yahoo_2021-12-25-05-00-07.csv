12/25/2021,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Officials in the northwestern Chinese city of Xian are facing punishment after a COVID-19 outbreak led to the lockdown of its 13 million residents, authorities said on Friday, as the number of new cases declined. All domestic flights out of Xian and most trains originating from the city scheduled for Friday were cancelled. Officials in Xian, which is famed for its terracotta warriors buried with China's first emperor, say the outbreak has been traced to the arrival of a plane from Pakistan. The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said in a statement that 26 people in Xian were being held accountable for ""not doing a good job"" in their COVID-19 prevention and control effort, but did not specify their punishment. New locally transmitted cases with confirmed symptoms in the city fell to 49 for Dec. 23, down from 63 a day earlier, the first decline since Dec. 10. Since Thursday, each Xian household has been limited to sending only one person to shop for necessities every two days, while others may not leave unless they have essential jobs. Xian has launched multiple rounds of mass testing. TOUGH MEASURES While the number of local symptomatic cases in Xian - there were 255 during the Dec 9-Dec 23 period - and in China overall is tiny compared with outbreaks elsewhere, authorities have used heavy-handed measures that have for the most part succeeded at preventing localised outbreaks from spreading. China is especially determined to extinguish any outbreak as Beijing prepares to stage the Winter Olympics in February. The country has all but shut its borders to international arrivals, and those coming for the Games will be sequestered inside a strictly-enforced ""closed-loop"". China's aggressive COVID-fighting approach has crimped domestic travel and consumer spending, and caused occasional localised industrial disruptions. On Friday electric vehicle maker BYD Co<002594.SZ> was seeing ""some impact"" from the lockdown on its operations in Xian, a company representative said. Nationwide, China confirmed 87 new symptomatic cases for Dec. 23, down from 100 a day earlier, its health authority said on Friday. Of those, 55 were locally transmitted, according to a statement by the National Health Commission, compared with 71 from a day earlier. There were no new deaths, leaving the death toll at 4,636. Mainland China had 100,731 confirmed COVID-19 cases as of Dec. 23.

12/25/2021,"It should have been the perfect escape from two gruelling years of the pandemic, but Katherine Miskena’s retreat at a tranquil farm called El Suspiro—which translates as The Sigh—ended in disaster. The Russian woman, 33, was staying at the rental property in Colombia’s northern Santander province with her boyfriend and a mysterious German tourist. On the evening of Dec. 18, police found her partly submerged body on the banks of a river near the remote village of Guaré, which is close to the farm. The officers had been alerted by Miguel Ángel Pérez, Miskena’s boyfriend. The Colombian national was admitted to a hospital in the town of Mogotes—about 90 minutes from Guaré—on Saturday with wounds to his face and skull caused by blunt-force trauma from a knife, according to a police report leaked anonymously to The Daily Beast. How Did This Couple’s Holiday End With a Woman Gunned Down? Local press reports indicate Pérez, 30, told police that he and Miskena had been attacked by a German man, Patrick Khenglawt, who was staying on the farm with them. Pérez said the assault had occurred at about 7:30 p.m. that same evening. After making his statement, Pérez was immediately transferred to the larger Manuela Beltrán del Socorro Hospital, where he remains hospitalized due to the serious nature of his wounds. When police searched the woods around the outskirts of Guaré they found Khenglawt not far from Miskena’s body and took him into custody. Khenglawt was then interrogated and received medical attention for “scratches” to his face—lacerations apparently inflicted by the victim as she struggled for her life. Colonel Wilson Parada, the police commander for the Santander region, said Meskina’s cause of death appeared to be strangulation, reported Colombian news outlet Caracol, but a formal autopsy is still pending. One working hypothesis is that “the incident was triggered by the consumption of home-made liquor and narcotics” by the farm’s residents. While intoxicated, Khenglawt may have made an “insinuation towards the female” which led to him “coming to blows with the [other] residents” and thus “triggering the current situation,” according to the leaked report. The police report also indicates the farm was in an area “without mobile [phone] signal” which might explain why the victims did not call for help and authorities were not alerted until Pérez showed up at the hospital in Mogotes. Despite Pérez’s eyewitness testimony, Parada said he was in no rush to file formal charges against Khenglawt, saying that, “the Santander police department [is] carrying out the pertinent investigative and judicial activities, to clarify and locate the person responsible for this action…” Although he did not go so far as to publicly call Khenglawt a murderer, Mogotes mayor Higinio Rueda Triana did publicly state that none of his own constituents were responsible for Miskena’s death. “I want to tell you that there is no Mogotano involved,” said Triana, as quoted in the Colombian news outlet Vanguardia. “That is what we want to tell the community and clarify the facts.” We Finally Know How 43 Students on a Bus Vanished Into Thin Air Triana also said that neighbors in the area had reported previous domestic disturbances at the farm, where Miskena and Pérez had been living for several months before Khenglawt arrived. “The community has stated that these foreigners who lived on the farm had had several difficulties of coexistence,” Triana said, and indicated that previous complaints had been lodged with the police prior to last Saturday’s tragedy. “We regret these facts that occur in our municipality and we really call on all foreigners to behave in our territory,” Triana said. The Russian embassy did not respond to questions in time for publication. An incident similar to the Miskena case occurred last September in the neighboring province of Antioquia, when a 25-year-old Czech tourist, Anna Tenterova, was found murdered near a rented farmhouse she shared with a British man. At least 18 tourists have been murdered in Antioquia’s Medellín district so far this year, making it one of the most dangerous parts of the country for foreign visitors. Read more at The Daily Beast.

12/25/2021,"Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., kept his annual tradition going this year by releasing his ""Festivus Report 2021,"" where he airs his grievances about wasteful spending in the federal government, and where the money could have been better spent. Festivus, of course, was made famous in a December 1997 ""Seinfeld"" episode called ""The Strike."" The fictional holiday occurs on Dec. 23—a day before Christmas Eve—and instead of basking in the glow of family members and candlelight, participants confront each other about annoyances endured during the year. The holiday is marked by an ""unadorned aluminum pole."" Paul’s office identified $52,598,515,585 what it sees as waste, including money spent on ""a study of pigeons gambling on slot machines, giving kids junk food, and telling citizens of Vietnam not to burn their trash,"" according to a statement. His list reads like a menu with bulleted items next to their price tags. He posted about the $549 million on Afghanistan Air Force planes he said were later sold as scrap, the $2.4 trillion in the construction of buildings in Afghanistan that essentially went unused and the pigeons playing slot machines study that cost $465,339. Paul’s statement said the average U.S. taxpayer pays about $15,332, which he said means the government wasted the taxes from about 3.4 million Americans. GET THE FOX NEWS APP The statement, which had footnotes to support his claims, said that $52 billion could have been spent on 13,149 miles of 4-lane highway construction across the U.S., 4.5 months of operating Veterans Affairs or giving every person in the world $6.78.",U.S./Fox News,"Sen.
