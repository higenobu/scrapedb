4/12/2022,"By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett needed just two weeks to put together Berkshire Hathaway Inc's $11.6 billion takeover of Alleghany Corp, its largest acquisition in six years, even as he balked at paying the insurer's banking fee, a regulatory filing on Monday shows. Alleghany said its Chief Executive Officer Joseph Brandon met with Buffett for dinner in New York City on March 7, where after some ""casual conversation"" Buffett offered $850 per share in cash for the company, less the fee for bankers at Goldman Sachs. Five days later, Brandon and Alleghany Chairman Jefferson Kirby met Buffett in Omaha, Nebraska, where Kirby asked Buffett to make a higher offer, pay Goldman's $27 million fee, or use Berkshire stock to fund part of the purchase. ""Mr. Buffett reiterated the terms of his original offer, indicating firmly he did not intend to change his position on those points,"" the filing said. Berkshire, which is based in Omaha, ultimately agreed to pay $848.02 per share, with the $1.98 difference from $850 accounting for Goldman's fee. The merger was announced on March 21. Alleghany got 25 days to potentially find a better offer. Goldman has since asked 31 potential bidders about their interest, the filing said. The ""go-shop"" period ends on April 14. Brandon led Berkshire's General Re unit from 2001 to 2008. Buffett, 91, has long objected to the costs of doing business on Wall Street. He rarely uses investment banks at Berkshire, relying on 98-year-old Vice Chairman Charlie Munger for help in major capital decisions. Buffett has praised former Goldman banker Byron Trott, working with him on purchases of food distributor McLane Co from Walmart Inc and a large stake in truck stop operator Pilot Flying J from the family of billionaire Jimmy Haslam. The Alleghany purchase is expected to close in the fourth quarter, pending regulatory and Alleghany shareholder approvals. Berkshire's last major acquisition was the $32.1 billion purchase of aircraft and industrial parts maker Precision Castparts in 2016.

4/12/2022,"By Kate Abnett and Alex Lawler BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) -OPEC told the European Union on Monday that current and future sanctions on Russia could create one of the worst ever oil supply shocks and it would be impossible to replace those volumes, and signalled it would not pump more. European Union officials held talks in Vienna with representatives of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries amid calls for the group to increase output and as the EU considers potential sanctions on Russian oil. ""We could potentially see the loss of more than 7 million barrels per day (bpd) of Russian oil and other liquids exports, resulting from current and future sanctions or other voluntary actions,"" OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said, according to a copy of his speech seen by Reuters. ""Considering the current demand outlook, it would be nearly impossible to replace a loss in volumes of this magnitude."" The European Union reiterated its call in the meeting for oil-producing countries to look at whether they can increase deliveries to help cool soaring oil prices, a European Commission official told Reuters. EU representatives also pointed out that OPEC has a responsibility to ensure balanced oil markets, the official said. OPEC has resisted calls by the United States and the International Energy Agency to pump more crude to cool prices, which reached a 14-year peak last month after Washington and Brussels imposed sanctions on Moscow following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In the meeting with OPEC, the EU said OPEC could provide more production from its spare capacity, according to an OPEC document seen by Reuters. Still, Barkindo said the current highly volatile market was a result of ""non-fundamental factors"" outside OPEC's control, in a signal the group would not pump more. OPEC+, which consists of OPEC and other producers including Russia, will raise output by about 432,000 barrels per day in May, as part of a gradual unwinding of output cuts made during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic. The EU-OPEC meeting on Monday afternoon was the latest in a dialogue launched between the two sides in 2005. Russian oil has been excluded from EU sanctions so far. But after the 27-country bloc agreed last week to sanction Russian coal - its first to target energy supplies - some senior EU officials said oil could be next. The European Commission is drafting proposals for an oil embargo on Russia, the foreign ministers of Ireland, Lithuania and the Netherlands said on Monday at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg, although there was no agreement to ban Russian crude. Australia, Canada and the United States, who are less reliant on Russian supply than Europe, have already banned Russian oil purchases. EU countries are split over whether to follow suit, given their higher dependency and the potential for the move to push up already high energy prices in Europe. The EU expects its oil use to decrease 30% by 2030, from 2015 levels, under its planned policies to fight climate change - though in the short term, an embargo would trigger a dash to replace Russian oil with alternative supplies.

4/12/2022,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has highlighted how fragile democracy can be, and how important it is for the U.S. (and its allies) to cultivate a strong military. This also speaks to the need for significant investments in cutting-edge technologies and solutions. So says Monness analyst Brian White who also thinks Palantir's (PLTR) unique approach leaves it well-positioned to benefit from this necessity. “We believe the recent chaos initially ushered in by the pandemic, and now the situation in Ukraine, shines a light on the critical nature of the proprietary work consummated by Palantir over the years. Increasingly, we expect more organizations will recognize the value of Palantir’s software,” said the 5-star analyst. The fact Palantir’s offerings – what it terms its “data integration and management platform within the data management and analytics industry” – are suited for such work is no coincidence. The company was founded with the intention of developing software to “support” the U.S. intelligence community’s “counterterrorism initiatives.” Since when, Palantir has cultivated a “strong presence across a broader scope” of government organizations. Historically, then, most of the company’s revenue has been derived from this segment and it has also been one of the arguments critics have used to state the bear case. That is, that its offerings are only suitable for large government bodies and enterprises. However, while the company might have initially started off with its energies focused on government programs, it has since built a “formidable presence” in the commercial segment. In 4Q21, 55% of revenues were generated from government customers, with the commercial segment accounting for the other 45%. Overall, the company estimates that its total market opportunity is around $119 billion, consisting of $56 billion from the commercial segment and $63 billion on the government side. In any case, White points out that Palantir “doesn’t fit neatly into traditional software segments,” believing that its platform is “unique in the world,” no matter into what category one wishes to “pigeonhole” its software. Such is its special appeal, White states that the majority of industry commentators will find it “difficult, if not impossible, to identify an exact competitor.” With all the above as backdrop, White initiated coverage of PLTR stock with a Buy rating and $20 price target. This figure conveys his confidence in PLTR's ability to soar 57% in the next twelve months.(To watch White’s track record, click here) Not everyone agrees with White’s assessment; based on 3 Buys, 4 Holds and 2 Sells, the stock claims a Hold consensus rating. The forecast calls for 12-month gains of ~13%, given the average price target clocks in at $14.44.
