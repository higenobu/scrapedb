5/13/2022,"Chelsea will not need reminding of the role Liverpool’s second-choice goalkeeper played in their downfall when the sides last met at Wembley. The form of Liverpool’s first choice – or “the best goalie in the world” to use Jürgen Klopp’s description – places a greater obstacle between Thomas Tuchel’s side and payback in Saturday’s FA Cup final. In a quadruple-chasing season featuring a club record 142 goals and counting, the dazzling impact of Luis Díaz, the world-class consistency of Sadio Mané and Mohamed Salah, and the contract doubts that surround them both, it is understandable the spotlight has settled only fleetingly on Alisson Becker. Yet as the away section at Villa Park recognised after Tuesday’s vital win over Aston Villa, when chanting the Brazilian’s name long after the final whistle, his contribution to Liverpool’s remarkable campaign cannot be overstated. In many respects the 29-year-old shaped this campaign from the outset with the 95th-minute winner at West Bromwich Albion last season that kept Klopp’s injury-hit team on course for Champions League qualification. “Now let’s try to win it this season and then it will be even more special,” said Alisson when reflecting on his centre-forward’s header in August. Liverpool are one step from granting that particular wish. The perfectionist in Alisson will have been annoyed by his part in Douglas Luiz’s opener for Villa and the error that gifted Ollie Watkins possession just outside the Liverpool penalty area. The unflappable professional in Alisson ensured neither affected his game, however, and two fine saves from Danny Ings helped secure the 2-1 victory that kept Liverpool on Manchester City’s tails with two games remaining in the title race. Douglas Luiz’s goal, and Son Heung-min’s for Tottenham on Saturday, kept Alisson waiting for a 21st clean sheet of the Premier League season. He has the opportunity to equal or surpass the Liverpool Premier League record of 21 – that Alisson set in his debut season at Anfield in 2018-19 – against Southampton and Wolves next week. Only Ederson has kept as many clean sheets this term, although Alisson has faced more shots and made more saves than his international teammate and Premier League rival. The fine margins between Liverpool and City even extend to the battle for the Golden Gloves award. Édouard Mendy, who Liverpool will face in the Cup final, trails the two Brazilians in third with 14 clean sheets. Alisson’s save percentage of 73.7 is the second-highest in the Premier League this season behind José Sá, whose number dipped to 74.5% after Wolves’ mauling by City on Wednesday. The Liverpool keeper’s ratio of saves inside the box has increased from 58.2% in 2019-20 to about 75% this season. His pass success rate is also up, marginally, from 85.5% last season to 86.2%. The statistics reflect a goalkeeper in prime form but do not encapsulate Alisson’s importance to Liverpool. Ings is the latest opposition striker who can vouch for the former Roma player’s formidable reputation in one-v-ones. That ability, enhanced by speed and awareness, gives Liverpool’s manager and defenders the confidence to play the high line so fundamental to Klopp’s approach, and to accept the risks that accompany it. Liverpool’s trust in Alisson was also evident when he was consulted over the appointment of Brazil World Cup winner Claudio Taffarel to their goalkeeping coaching staff in November. The position is always evolving, Klopp explained, and the responsibility on Alisson increasing. “When I was a player the most important skill [for a goalkeeper] was to save the ball but then it developed,” the Liverpool manager said. “You could pass the ball back but that meant the goalkeeper had to use his feet and it was really tricky. It is obviously a position that is getting more and more influential and not only in the defensive moments but also the offensive moments. “You see now a lot of goalkeepers are pretty long when they shoot the balls, which is good for some teams and we use that tactic from time to time as well. But it is more about being involved in the buildup situations; you can give the ball to the centre-halves without thinking: ‘Oh my God, what is he doing?’’ You’ve got to shoot [go long] with channelled balls, switch the balls from side, make the game big – all these kind of things.” Chelsea could find no way past Caoimhín Kelleher during 120 minutes of February’s enthralling Carabao Cup final. That was the third draw in three meetings between the clubs this season before Kelleher scored Liverpool’s final penalty – and Mendy’s 119th-minute replacement, Kepa Arrizabalaga, missed Chelsea’s – as Klopp’s team triumphed 11-10 in the shootout. The return of Alisson will strengthen Liverpool’s belief for part two of their quadruple pursuit.",Sport/Football,"Alisson Becker, Liverpool’s Mr Consistent in quest for quadruple",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/12/alisson-becker-liverpools-mr-consistent-in-quest-for-quadruple-fa-cup-final
5/13/2022,"Thirty-six years after his first success in the Dante Stakes with Shahrastani, Sir Michael Stoute was back on track in more ways than one at York on Thursday as Desert Crown, a big gamble for the Derby in recent weeks, quickened clear of seven opponents in Britain’s last major trial and took over as the new favourite for the Classic on 4 June. Stoute was Britain’s champion trainer 10 times between 1981 and 2009 and has five Derby winner’s trophies on his mantlepiece at Freemason Lodge, the most recent from Workforce’s Epsom victory in 2010 after he had finished second in the Dante. His once pre-eminent stable has not had so much as a runner in the Derby since 2016, however, and only two starters in the premier Classic since Carlton House, the favourite, narrowly missed out behind Pour Moi in 2011. Stoute’s appearances on the racecourse have also become increasingly rare in recent months but he was on the Knavesmire to see Desert Crown cut through the field from two furlongs out and then extend his lead over Royal Patronage to three-and-a-quarter lengths at the line, despite drifting right in the closing stages. Desert Crown is open to any amount of improvement after what was only the second start of his career, and this victory was enough to see him end Stone Age’s four-day reign as Derby favourite after his wide-margin win at Leopardstown on Sunday. Stoute’s colt is now top-priced at 9-4 (from 7-1) for Epsom with Stone Age out to 100-30. Changingoftheguard, O’Brien’s Chester Vase winner, at 9-1 is the only other runner at single-figure odds. “It’s only his second race, he’s travelled well and he’s accelerated pleasingly,” Stoute said afterwards. “You have to be very happy with that performance. “I thought it was a strong Dante, but I wasn’t confident because I felt we’d only just got him up to a race having had a minor setback late February. We didn’t rush him, we took our time and he was only just ready to run now.” Richard Kingscote, Desert Crown’s jockey, has had just one previous ride in the Derby, finishing 11th of 12 on the 14-1 shot Knight To Behold in 2018, but can now look forward to riding the favourite in three weeks’ time. Kingscote is effectively No.2 behind Ryan Moore at the Stoute stable, but Moore’s first commitment to ride for Aidan O’Brien – who had the third-home Bluegrass on Thursday – is likely to see him riding Stone Age at Epsom. “Of course, Ryan’s horse in Ireland [Stone Age] was very impressive and going to a Derby is always going to be difficult,” Kingscote said. “He’s done well from two to three, I was taken with how well he’s filled out and they’ve done a great job with him. “I’m in a very privileged position to be able to work under Sir Michael and Ryan, I’ve been lucky Ryan had one in the race today and people were nice enough to let me on. Fortunately I delivered on that.” Many owners might have been tempted to send Stradivarius off to stud at the end of 2018, when his big-race wins included the Ascot Gold Cup and Goodwood Cup. If so, his first crop of two-year-olds would have been stepping on to the track this spring. Instead, the grand old horse himself is still going strong and about to start his seventh season on the racecourse in Friday’s Yorkshire Cup. Cavalryman, in 2014, is the only eight-year-old “entire” horse to win at Group Two level in Britain in the last 20 years, and John Gosden, Stradivarius’s trainer, said this week that he is “certainly not giving him hard, hard works at home, he’s too old for that”. Gosden added: “I don’t want everyone there thinking he’s going to necessarily go and win another Yorkshire Cup, I’d just like to see him run a race that acts as a platform going forward.” On that basis, Stradivarius looks too short for Friday’s race at 4-5 and Dermot Weld’s gritty mare Search For A Song (3.35) is the obvious one to bet against him at around 5-1. The six-year-old has Group One-winning form in the 2020 Irish St Leger, has the benefit of a run behind her already this year and gets a handy 6lb from the favourite. York 1.50: An astonishing 13 of these juveniles – in a 16-strong field – were winners last time out so the biggest improver is likely to land the spoils. Fix You is a tentative pick having put up a fair performance on the clock when going clear on debut at Thirsk last month. Newbury 2.05: Puerto De Vega was much improved on the all-weather over the winter and will go close if transferring that form back to the turf. York 2.25: John Gosden’s Grande Dame won despite very obvious greenness at Ascot last month and should take this step up in class in her stride. York 3.00: A couple of fancied runners have a stamina question to answer so Belloccio could be a fair bet at around 6-1 to follow up a career-best at Kempton last month. York 4.10: A strong hand here for Charlie Appleby, with Yibir’s brother Wild Crusade a marginal pick over the unbeaten New Comedy after his ready win on handicap debut at Kempton last month.",Sport/Sport,Desert Crown is new Derby favourite after storming Dante Stakes win,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/12/desert-crown-is-new-derby-favourite-after-storming-dante-stakes-win
5/13/2022,"Amateur boxing has been plunged into a fresh crisis after the sole rival to the sport’s Russian president was barred from standing on the eve of the International Boxing Association’s election. Sources close to Iba have told the Guardian that the Dutch candidate Boris van der Vorst, who had been due to challenge Umar Kremlev for the Iba presidency, was barred for breaching their regulations by being part of an alliance of 18 countries that had openly criticised Iba’s reaction to the war in Ukraine and its reliance on Gazprom funding. Van Der Vorst is now appealing to the court of arbitration for sport after being blindsided by the news. Five other candidates for Iba’s executive board, who were also on the Common Cause Alliance pressure group opposed to Kremlev, have also been barred from Friday’s elections in Istanbul. The decision leaves boxing, which has been rocked by numerous judging and financial scandals in recent years, facing more questions about its Olympic future. Boxing is currently not on the roster for the LA Games in 2028 and, as revealed by the Guardian on Wednesday, the IOC sent a letter to Kremlev earlier this week saying it had “significant concerns” about the governance and financing of Iba. After this latest news, many are now openly questioning whether there is any way back for the organisation. In a statement, Iba said that the decision had been taken by the Interim Nomination Unit, an independent body created in February to establish the eligibility and analyse the skillsets of nominees. The statement said: “Complaints were made to the Interim Nomination Unit on 11 and 13 April 2022 that the activities of these candidates were improper under the IBA regulations insofar as they constituted participation in another international boxing organisation, prohibited collaboration between candidates and electoral campaigning outside the Electoral period. “The activities in question were based around the creation of a group called the Common Cause Alliance in which the candidates listed participated, together with exchanges of open letters with the Iba.” The Dutch federation, led by Van der Vorst, was among 18 national federations, including the US, England, France, Australia and Canada, that formed the alliance earlier this year to ask the Iba to disclose financial information involved in its agreement with Gazprom. It later called for an eight-point action designed to address the damage caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine – and for the Iba to take stronger action against the Russian Boxing Federation. In a terse response to the news, the IOC said it was “monitoring the developments in Iba very closely”.",Sport/Sport,Amateur boxing crisis grows as election rival to Russian Iba president is barred,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/12/amateur-boxing-crisis-boris-van-der-vorst-election-rival-to-russian-iba-president-umar-kremlev-barred
5/13/2022,"The former MP Natalie McGarry has been found guilty of embezzling almost £25,000 from the pro-independence group she helped set up and from her local Scottish National party branch. After a six-week trial at Glasgow sheriff court, the jury found her guilty by majority of a charge of embezzling £21,000 while she was treasurer of the Women for Independence campaign group between 26 April 2013 and 30 November 2015. She was also found guilty by majority of a second charge of taking £4,661 between 9 April 2014 and 10 August 2015 when she was treasurer, secretary and convener of the Glasgow Regional Association of the SNP. McGarry, who was elected to represent the Glasgow East constituency for the SNP in 2015, but resigned the whip after she was first linked to allegations of missing donations in November of that year, denied the charges. The trial heard from senior figures in the independence movement and the Scottish government, including the current and former Scottish health secretaries Humza Yousaf and Jeane Freeman. Freeman was also one of the founding members of Women for Independence, which remains one of the most significant grassroots groups to emerge from the 2014 campaign. McGarry’s lawyers admitted her finances were “disorganised” and “chaotic”, but prosecutors insisted that transfers of funds to her private account when, for example, her rent was due was “calculated” and “deliberate”. Alistair Mitchell, for the prosecution, told the jury towards the end of the trial: “When you contribute money to an organisation you expect that to be used for that purpose. You don’t expect to pay McGarry’s rent or keep up her payments or unaccountable altogether.” Speaking after the verdict, Freeman told BBC Scotland she was pleased the situation had been resolved “after seven long years”. She said the money had come from ordinary people who had wanted women’s voices to be heard in the 2014 referendum and “who had given us their hard-earned cash often in situations when they could least afford to do that”. McGarry had an earlier conviction for embezzlement quashed in December 2019 after appeal court judges ruled she had suffered a miscarriage of justice.",News/UK news,Former SNP MP Natalie McGarry found guilty of embezzlement,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/12/natalie-mcgarry-former-snp-mp-found-guilty-of-embezzlement

Mattel’s global head of Barbie Dolls, Lisa McKnight, said in a statement: “It’s important for kids to see themselves reflected in product and to encourage play with dolls that don’t resemble them, to help them understand and celebrate the importance of inclusion.” Mattel said it worked alongside Dr Jen Richardson, a practitioner in educational audiology, to accurately model behind-the-ear devices for the doll. “I’m honored to have worked with Barbie to create an accurate reflection of a doll with behind-the-ear hearing aids,” Richardson said. “As an educational audiologist with over 18 years of experience working in hearing loss advocacy, it’s inspiring to see those who experience hearing loss reflected in a doll. “I’m beyond thrilled for my young patients to see and play with a doll who looks like them.” The 2022 Fashionistas line, out next month, will also feature a Barbie with a prosthetic leg, a Barbie who uses a wheelchair, and male dolls that are thinner and less muscular. Barbie has described its upcoming 175-look collection as its “most diverse and inclusive doll line, offering a variety of skin tones, eye colors, hair colors and textures, body types, disabilities, and fashions, to inspire even more stories”. In recent years, Barbie has launched more inclusive doll lines including one inspired by real-life women who have upended societal norms. In 2017, Barbie released a doll wearing a hijab, modelled after Ibtihaj Muhammad, a fencer who became the first American to compete and win an Olympic medal wearing the garment. Last year, Barbie launched a set of dolls that honoured Covid workers including vaccinologists, nurses and paramedics. One of the dolls is modelled after Dame Sarah Gilbert, the co-creator of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. “I am passionate about inspiring the next generation of girls into Stem careers and hope that children who see my Barbie will realise how vital careers in science are to help the world around us,” Gilbert told the Guardian. “My wish is that my doll will show children careers they may not be aware of, like a vaccinologist.”",News/US news,Barbie unveils first doll with hearing aid as part of inclusivity push,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/12/barbie-dolls-diversity-ken-hearing-aid-vitiligo
5/13/2022,"In a church hall in the market town of Sutton-in-Ashfield in Nottinghamshire, a group of local residents are busily cooking up an array of meals from scratch, using skills they’ve learned over a 15-week community cooking course. They never expected to be thrust into the national spotlight this week, when their local Conservative MP, Lee Anderson, said food poverty in the country was down to people not being able to cook and budget properly. He invited opposition MPs to visit his local food bank Let’s All Eat, which also encourages some long-term food bank users to take part in the cooking course they run in conjunction with Sutton Community Academy. Many of the people taking part in the class on Thursday felt Anderson did have a point. “If people are taught how to cook properly then maybe they would have a bit more money left in their pocket, instead of spending it on takeaways,” said Jennifer Quimby, a 38-year-old carer with four children. “There are obviously people out there who just don’t have any money, maybe their benefits have changed or they’ve lost their job, and they genuinely do need that help. No amount of knowing how to cook is going to help with that. “Everybody’s bills are going up as well. My fuel costs are out of this world, and with food on top, it does all add up. But knowing how to cook proper food, it does make things cheaper. I waste a lot less now.” The class, which is voluntary and not compulsory as Anderson suggested, teaches people in the local community how to use economical and healthy ingredients “so they are more able to stretch the thin resources they have”, said Simon Martin, a director of Let’s All Eat. They are now also investing in a number of slow cookers to teach people how to make meals using less electricity. “Our mission is very much helping the community to become more self-sufficient in the longer term,” Martin said. “But there is still very real food poverty here. Since 3 May, we’ve had 23 new referrals for emergency food parcels. And that’s rising even as we speak. “Clearly the cost of living and energy crisis is biting and where the numbers will top out this time, we simply don’t know.” At another food bank in the constituency, people weren’t so sympathetic to Anderson’s views. “This is a lifeline for me, without this my kids would starve,” said a mother of four, who asked not to be named, visiting the food bank for a second time. She has had to stop working due to illness and her universal credit payments have been paused. She prides herself on being able to cook fresh meals from scratch using whatever ingredients she gets in the parcel, researching anything she’s never come across before. “Everything I’ve got goes on bills. I just find it quite patronising, especially when you think what MPs are walking away with each month, they’re not struggling and so many of us are,” she said. Some parts of Ashfield are among the most deprived in the country, with House of Commons data showing about 16% of the constituency is “highly deprived” and nearly a third of pupils are on free school meals. Jason Zadrozny, the leader of Ashfield Independents who control the local council, said he had been inundated with messages from angry residents about Anderson’s comments. “He is so out of touch – it is an insult to the whole Ashfield community,” he said. “People are furious.” Zadrozny came second to Anderson in the 2019 general election, when the Conservatives took the former “red wall” constituency from Labour, who had controlled it almost continuously since its creation. “In 2019, there was a huge amount of people in Ashfield who lent the Tories their vote for the first time ever, and he’s scoffing at them now,” he said. At Let’s All Eat, they said there is not much time for political debate when there’s a growing tide of people in need of help. “We’re delivering about 150 emergency parcels a week now,” said Linda Smith, manager of the food bank. “We’ve got people asking for stuff they can heat on the hob because they can’t afford to run their oven. We don’t want to get involved in politics, we just want to help people.”",News/Society,‘An insult to the whole community’: Sutton-in-Ashfield people react to MP’s food bank comments,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/12/an-insult-to-the-whole-community-mps-food-bank-comments-out-of-touch-in-sutton-in-ashfield-say-locals
5/13/2022,"Claims that the UK government has discovered a legal justification for tearing up large parts of Brexit arrangements in Northern Ireland have been greeted with scorn by expert lawyers. The attorney general, Suella Braverman, has reportedly approved overriding the Northern Ireland protocol on the grounds that it is being unfairly enforced by the EU. Her submission, understood to be based on external advice, claims the EU’s “disproportionate and unreasonable” implementation is undermining the Good Friday agreement (GFA), according to the Times. But George Peretz QC, a barrister who specialises in EU law, told the Guardian: “I can’t see how any lawyer could possibly advise the government that they’ve got a slam-dunk case. What I’ve seen so far doesn’t give them sustainable legal cover.” Sir Jonathan Jones, who resigned as head of the government’s legal department in 2020 when ministers last threatened to ditch parts of the protocol, told BBC Radio 4’s PM programme: “The government knew about the Good Friday agreement when it entered into this protocol, and the protocol is said to be a way of protecting the interests of the Good Friday agreement. So the idea that now becomes a basis for walking away from the protocol I think is very problematic.” On Thursday the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, reiterated UK plans to scrap parts of the protocol, telling the EU’s Brexit negotiator it was a matter of “internal peace and security”. According to the Times, Braverman’s advice says the GFA has “primordial significance” over the protocol and its current implementation is creating “societal unrest”. Peretz said: “‘Primordial significance’ is not a legal term that I’ve ever come across.” Catherine Barnard, a professor in EU law at Trinity College, Cambridge, agreed. She said: “There is no hierarchy of treaties in law. The GFA may be a political priority, but it has no primacy in law.” She said the UK could come up with a legal argument for invoking article 16, which allows for suspending some obligations under the protocol, if specific difficulties could be proved. But this was “very limited” in scope and time, and subject to review. She said the legal requirement for ditching the protocol was “an extremely high bar”. Peretz reckoned the government would struggle to justify invoking article 16 based on economic problems, because these were known about in advance. “It was pretty obvious to both parties that putting a border down the Irish Sea was going to divert trade, so that would be a bizarre argument,” he said. He added that growing sectarian tensions, reportedly cited by Braverman, would not be enough to overturn an international treaty. “In international law, social unrest is not a basis for denouncing a treaty which you’ve signed,” Peretz said. Braverman’s reported claim about the primacy of the GFA over the protocol also runs counter to the text of the agreement, Peretz said. “Article 1.3 says the protocol is not only consistent with the GFA but necessary to it,” he said. He pointed out that this principle had been upheld in the court of appeal. “The government itself has argued strenuously in court that the protocol is entirely consistent with the GFA, so I don’t see how this can possibly get off the ground.” Barnard called for Braverman’s advice to be made public. Peretz said the government may be reluctant to publish. He said: “When I was a government lawyer 30 years ago, it was drummed into me that you never ever published the attorney general’s advice. The advice may be guarded and nuanced, and say that the arguments against are quite strong. To publish something like that is not that impressive.” Some lawyers have backed the government’s plans for a bill to override the protocol. They include Martin Howe, the chair of the pro-Brexit group Lawyers for Britain. In a Telegraph article last month, he wrote: “The EU must be brought to recognise that no sovereign and independent state can long tolerate a part of its territory being subject to foreign courts and laws. The EU would understand that once the bill became law they would lose the power to continue to impose the protocol.” Peretz said this was a minority view among lawyers. He said: “If the advice is all about the conditions for exercising article 16, this is something the government might arguably be able to run. As to whether there’s an argument for simply ditching parts of the treaty on the basis that the text isn’t binding on the UK any more, that’s much more difficult. And I think there’s general agreement about that.” He added: “I have no idea the extent to which the government has hawked around the bar until it found a lawyer who is prepared to say what it wants. But that’s possible.”",News/Politics,Experts scorn UK government claim it can ditch parts of NI protocol,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/12/experts-scorn-uk-government-claim-it-can-ditch-parts-of-ni-protocol
5/13/2022,"In 1970, when the RSPB asked the bird artist Robert Gillmor, who has died aged 85, to design their new logo, the species they chose was the avocet. Following a century’s absence, this elegant wader had successfully returned to the UK, to breed on several RSPB reserves. But, as Robert explained many years later, there was another reason why the avocet was preferred over more common and familiar birds, such as the robin or blue tit. It was black and white, which meant that it could be easily reproduced in the days when colour printing was both expensive and impractical. That emphasis – on the way art is used in the real world – sums up Robert’s life and work. His artwork is striking, beautiful and distinctive; yet it has always been defined by where it appeared. He was, above all, a very public artist: his output adorning the covers of the RSPB’s Birds magazine, gracing the dustjackets of dozens of books, and appearing, in miniature, on several series of stamps. But it was his varied and vivid designs, from 1985 onwards, for the covers of the Collins New Naturalist books, widely acknowledged as the most significant natural history series ever published, that were among his greatest accomplishments. This was a daunting task: Robert took over from the original cover artists, husband-and-wife team Clifford and Rosemary Ellis, whose designs had played a major part in the series’ commercial and critical success. Yet the publishers need not have worried: Robert’s covers were classic, but with a modern twist; he ultimately produced more than 70 unique and colourful dustjackets – even more than his distinguished predecessors. Robert was, perhaps, destined to make a living from his art. His maternal grandfather, Allen W Seaby, was one of the finest bird painters of the first half of the 20th century, and professor of fine art at Reading University. As a sickly child, Robert often missed school; while absent, he would spend many happy hours watching his grandfather at work in his studio. By the time the teenage Robert’s interest in art began to develop, Seaby was in his 80s. Nevertheless, shortly before his grandfather’s death, they collaborated on illustrations for two of the famous Ladybird children’s books on British birds. Seaby also gave him his first optical aid – an ancient monocular – which Robert soon supplemented with a brass telescope. He then persuaded his parents to buy his first bird book: a lavish volume costing two guineas, illustrated by Charles Tunnicliffe. Born in Reading, Berkshire, Robert lived in the same tree-lined avenue until he was 62 years old. He was the younger of two brothers; their father, Gerald, was an accountant, while their mother, Mildred (nee Seaby), worked for her brother’s antique coin dealership. Robert’s early interest in wildlife art was encouraged by the teachers at Leighton Park school, although he later described his school career – art aside – as “pretty hopeless”. At the age of 13, he was elected as the first ever junior member of Reading Ornithological Club, ultimately becoming its life president. He also served on the councils of the RSPB, British Trust for Ornithology and British Ornithologists’ Union; later, in recognition of his long and devoted service, each of these organisations awarded him their most prestigious medal. After leaving school, Robert studied at his grandfather’s former department at Reading University, obtaining a national diploma in design in 1958, and his teaching diploma the following year. He then returned to teach at Leighton Park, as head of art and craft, until 1965, when he left to become a full-time artist. In 1960, he and fellow artist Eric Ennion had organised an exhibition of contemporary bird paintings at Reading Art Gallery, which then toured other venues to great acclaim. Four years later, spurred on by this success, they co-founded the Society of Wildlife Artists (SWLA), which would have a crucial and lasting influence on the development of nature-based art. Robert was the driving force of the SWLA for more than half a century, until ill-health intervened, and was the only artist whose work has appeared every year since that first exhibition. Throughout his life, he would offer advice to young and up-and-coming wildlife artists, many of whom he inspired to forge successful careers in the field. For 30 years, from the early 1970s onwards, Robert was the art editor of the authoritative, nine-volume handbook The Birds of the Western Palearctic. He painted some plates himself but, with typical generosity, mainly commissioned his fellow artists to do so. He was also a regular fixture in the art marquee at Birdfair, the British birdwatching fair in Rutland, and also designed many of its programme covers, which provided a shop window for the global conservation projects funded by this annual event. In 1998 Robert and his wife, Susan (nee Norman), a fellow artist whom he had married in 1974, moved to the north Norfolk village of Cley. Over the following two decades, he continued to create a prodigious output of paintings, prints, linocuts and drawings – each one instantly recognisable as a “Gillmor” – and many of which were displayed at the nearby Pinkfoot and Birdscapes galleries. He would also spend time in the hides at Cley Marshes, quietly sketching birds, to the delight of the other visitors. In 2010, Robert was approached by the Royal Mail to design a series of postage stamps featuring British birds, eventually producing no fewer than 36 designs. Afterwards, the original linocuts were sold, part of the proceeds going to the Norfolk Wildlife Trust. In recognition of his lifetime’s achievements, in 2015 this kind, inspirational and deeply modest man was appointed MBE. He is survived by Susan, his children, Emily and Thomas, and his grandchildren, Jude, Amy, Angus and Isabelle. His brother, Philip, predeceased him.
