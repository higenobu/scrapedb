5/4/2022,"With reproductive rights in peril across the US and a draft supreme court ruling that would overturn Roe v Wade, California is working to further enshrine abortion rights and expand access in anticipation of a surge of people seeking care from out of state. California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, has long pledged that the state would become a “sanctuary” for people seeking reproductive care if the supreme court were to overturn the 1973 case that guaranteed the right to abortion. After a draft ruling leaked showing the court may have decided to do just that, Newsom said he and state leaders were proposing an amendment that would “enshrine the right to choose” in California’s constitution. State lawmakers are currently considering recommendations from a council tasked to finding solutions in case Roe is overturned. “We can’t trust Scotus to protect the right to abortion, so we’ll do it ourselves,” Newsom said on Twitter. “Women will remain protected here.” NEW: We are proposing an amendment to enshrine the right to choose in the California constitution.We can’t trust SCOTUS to protect the right to abortion, so we’ll do it ourselves.Women will remain protected here. https://t.co/WTUpfymLS0 In the draft ruling, obtained by Politico in the biggest leak in the modern history of the supreme court, Justice Samuel Alito describes Roe as “egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences”. The court confirmed the authenticity of the draft, but said it did not “represent a decision by the court or the final position of any member”. The potential decision has shaken the country, where abortion has been legal for nearly 50 years but under constant threat as Republican states significantly reduced access and sought to ban the procedure entirely. The majority of Americans believe abortion should be legal and news of the draft ruling has prompted protests and widespread outrage. If the court ultimately decides to overturn Roe v Wade, more than half of US states will outlaw abortion, closing abortion clinics for 41% of women of reproductive age and forcing hundreds of thousands of people to travel elsewhere to obtain the procedure. Experts warn some states may attempt to ban people from traveling for abortions. States where abortion would remain legal such as California would be significantly affected if Roe were to fall, with a major influx of out-of-state patients that could increase wait times for abortions. The state has already reported seeing more patients since Texas banned abortions after six weeks. California could see an almost 3,000% increase in the number of people whose nearest legal abortion provider is in the state, which could increase the annual patient load from 46,000 people to 1.4 million with many patients coming from as near as Arizona, according to a Guttmacher Institute report. Jodi Hicks, the CEO and president of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, said the draft ruling is a “nightmare scenario”. ""Leaked draft shows U.S. Supreme Court has voted to strike down Roe v. Wade""This is the nightmare scenario we in the reproductive health, rights, and justice space have been sounding the alarm about -- especially once SCOTUS had a conservative majority.https://t.co/irLELRImdJ Dianne Feinstein, California’s Democratic senator, warned if the court overturns Roe “women will be harmed and some will die. It happened before Roe became the law of the land and it will happen again, particularly since this decision will harm low-income and at-risk women more than anyone.” I remember the days when abortion was illegal, when we would pass the hat at Stanford to collect money so a classmate could go to Mexico for an abortion. Overturning Roe would return us to those dark ages where women don’t have safe, open access to reproductive care. California has already taken steps to navigate a post-Roe world. Last year, Newsom commissioned the California Future of Abortion Council, made up of more than 40 abortion providers and advocacy groups, which released a list of 45 recommendations for the state to consider if the court overturns Roe. The recommendations, some of which are part of legislation under consideration by state lawmakers, included creating a fund to support care for low-income Californians and people traveling from out of state to obtain abortions. Newsom signed legislation in March prohibiting health plans and insurers from charging people a copay or deductible for abortion and abortion-related services. The president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Los Angeles, Sue Dunlap, told CalMatters that her organization has been preparing for this moment by expanding and moving facilities near airports and other transit centers and supportive medical providers. Several Democratic states had already taken steps to affirm reproductive rights in anticipation of the court’s decision. Earlier this year, New Jersey passed a law enshrining the right to abortion into state law. In Vermont, voters are expected to approve a constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to abortion and contraception later this year. After news of the decision, governors across the US said their states would continue to ensure abortion is safe and legal. Kate Brown, the governor of Oregon, said Monday on Twitter that abortion is protected by state law in Oregon. “We will fight to keep it that way, no matter what this supreme court decides,” she said. JB Pritzker, the Illinois governor, said the state would remain a haven for people seeking reproductive care. The Vermont governor, Republican Phil Scott, said the “fundamental rights and liberties of all women will be defended, protected and preserved in Vermont”.",News/US news,‘We can’t trust Scotus’: California pledges to protect abortion rights,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/03/california-abortion-rights-roe-v-wade-scotus
5/4/2022,"The deathwatch beetle (Xestobium rufovillosum) gets its name from the tapping sound it makes when trying to attract a mate. In more superstitious times people living in old houses, keeping vigil by the sick beds of relatives, believed the sound to be a harbinger of death, hence the name. That was a myth but the sound should set the alarm bells ringing for any owner of property containing old oak beams. These beetles can hollow them out and cause a collapse – as nearly happened in Westminster Hall in 1913. They like oak that is more than 100 years old best, slightly softened by damp and fungus. If you cannot hear them in action, holes larger than those caused by normal woodworm are a telltale sign, but these could be centuries old. Filling them up with furniture wax and keeping an eye for new holes is a useful check. However, the beetles can gnaw away at wood for up to 10 years in the pupae stage before emerging as adults. Once the adults have found each other by tapping inside the hollow beams they breed immediately and the gnawing begins again. Even modern methods of killing them do not seem to reach every beetle so very dry and solid timbers are the best defence. Even deathwatch beetles cannot chew through these.",News/Environment,Specieswatch: beware the deathwatch beetle,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/04/specieswatch-beware-the-deathwatch-beetle
5/4/2022,"The first major study since Brexit of UK citizens living in the EU has revealed its profound impact on their lives, with many expressing serious concerns over their loss of free movement and voting rights – and a very different perception of Britain. The survey, of 1,328 British nationals across the continent, showed that if “the public narrative suggests Brexit is done and dusted, it has brought deep transformations to the lives of British citizens in the EU and EEA”, the study’s co-lead, said. “The long tail of Brexit is evident in its continuing impacts both on the way they live their lives, and in its lasting significance for their sense of identity and belonging,” said Benson, a sociology professor at Lancaster University. The survey, conducted between December 2021 and January 2022, a year after the end of the Brexit transition period, and part of a wider project by Lancaster and Birmingham universities, found 59% of respondents had lived in their country of residence for at least five years and most intended to stay. But many were angered by their loss of free movement, meaning they can no longer move within the EU for work, or retire to another EU country, and especially worried about being unable to return to the UK with non-British family members in future. Asked whether their past or future migration plans had been affected by Brexit, 27% of respondents said it had affected them a great deal, and 14% a lot. “Where does one even start?” was the response of one British citizen living in Belgium. “Loss of rights like freedom of movement around the EU and to the UK. With a wife who is an EU citizen, I had to decide whether to move to the relevant EU country or stay in the UK. Family now cannot move back to Britain. Uncertainty.” Another said: “I moved to France in 2020 in order to protect my right to live and work in France post-Brexit. My migration is 100% a result of Brexit.” Brexit, and the British government’s handling of the Covid pandemic, strongly affected 80% of respondents’ feelings towards the UK, with responses including “deep shame”, “disappointment”, “a shit show”, “embarrassed to be British”, “shambolic”, and “like watching a house on fire”. Just over 30% still felt very or extremely emotionally attached to the UK, compared with 75% who said they felt a very or extreme emotional attachment to the EU, and 59% who felt the same in relation to their country of residence. “For me, one of the most interesting things the survey reveals is this sense of disappointment, shame and anguish over Brexit and the pandemic – and a really quite pronounced expression of European identity,” Benson said. About two-thirds had changed their legal status since 2016, acquiring residency or citizenship. But nearly half did not have the same status – and therefore the same migration and settlement rights – as some or all of their close family members. This was a major or significant concern for a large majority of respondents, who said it was affecting their own and their children’s work, career and education, or would do so in the future. “My wife is a Russian citizen,” said one respondent in Italy. “Her right to live and work depend upon my status under the withdrawal agreement. She fears a potential move to another EU country as her residency rights are totally dependent upon mine.” Those who felt they may want or need to move back to the UK at some stage felt particularly affected, since non-British partners and other family members coming with them would now be subject to UK domestic immigration controls. “I have a house in England,” said one respondent, who has lived in the Netherlands for 10 years. “I was going to retire there. It’s now being sold. My wife is Dutch. I do not think she could even relocate back to the UK – despite joint ownership of a house, having lived there for 15 years, being fluent in English and having two dual-nationality kids.” The loss of EU voting rights was also a big concern, with 46% saying they could no longer vote in European elections or, in most cases, local elections in their country of residence. Roughly 42% were also unable to vote in the UK because they had lived abroad for more than 15 years, although this is expected to change.",News/Politics,‘Embarrassed to be British’: Brexit study reveals impact on UK citizens in EU,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/04/brexit-study-reveals-impact-britons-in-eu
5/4/2022,"They were separated by thousands of miles and the two sets of builders could not conceivably have met or swapped notes, but intriguing parallels between Stonehenge and Japanese stone circles are to be highlighted in an exhibition at the monument on Salisbury Plain. The exhibition will show that ancient people in southern Britain and in Japan took great trouble to build stone circles, appear to have celebrated the passage of the sun and felt moved to come together for festivals or rituals. Circles of Stone: Stonehenge and Prehistoric Japan will flag up similarities between the monuments and settlements of the middle and late Jōmon period in Japan and those built by the late neolithic people of southern Britain – and point out some of the differences. The exhibition will feature 80 striking objects, some of which have never before been seen outside Japan. Key loans announced on Wednesday include a flame pot, a highly decorated type of Jōmon ceramics, its fantastical shape evoking blazing flames. Such pots were produced in Japan for a relative short period, perhaps only a few hundred years. Also featured will be fragments of dogū, clay figurines that have been found at Jōmon settlements and stone circles and may have represented earth goddesses or spirits and been used in fertility or healing rituals. It is believed that many dogū were intentionally broken and scattered during ceremonies. Among the Japanese sites that will be in focus is that of the Ōyu Stone Circles in northern Japan. It does not feature the sort of hulking standing stones that Stonehenge is famous for but rather two large circles made of thousands of river pebbles. The circles include small standing “sundial” stones that align to the sun on midsummer daybreak. At Stonehenge on the longest day of the year, the sun’s first rays shine into the heart of the monument. Dr Susan Greaney, a senior properties historian with English Heritage and a curator of Circles of Stone, said the Wiltshire and Japanese circles suggested a “shared response” to their creators’ environment and seasonal cycles. “To understand the significance of Stonehenge, we have to understand what is happening elsewhere in the world in prehistory,” she said. “Although there was obviously no contact between Japan and Britain at this time, there are surprising parallels.” Greaney said Jōmon people and their neolithic counterparts in southern Britain shared the same sort of climate, topography and access to natural resources. Both were building stone circles aligned with the movements of the sun and took great care to remember their ancestors. Both peoples produced similar tools and pots and created settlements around important monuments. “But there are also really interesting differences,” Greaney said. She argued it was not fair to say that because the Japanese produced more elaborate ceramics, they were more advanced – it could be, for instance, that it was taboo in neolithic Britain to make objects representing the human figure. Or that the ancient Britons had the upper hand because they were farmers, whereas those who built stone circles in Japan were fishers, hunters and gatherers. “They are just different,” she said. Simon Kaner, the executive director of the Sainsbury Institute for the Study of Japanese Arts and Cultures, said he was excited to see precious objects from Japan being displayed at Stonehenge. “This is an unprecedented opportunity to explore comparisons between Jōmon Japan and neolithic Britain – separated by some 10,000km at either end of Eurasia, but sharing the desire to build monuments,” he said. Kaner said it was fascinating that no dogū-like figures had been found in southern Britain, with the nearest comparable ones discovered in south-east Europe. “It may be that ceramic figures caught the imagination of the people in Japan but not here,” he said. “Holding the exhibition at Stonehenge itself offers visitors the chance to reflect on common themes of what it means to be human, as well as difference, diversity and creativity in prehistory.” Circles of Stone: Stonehenge and Prehistoric Japan runs from 30 September 2022 until 31 August 2023. Admission will be free to Stonehenge ticket holders, English Heritage and National Trust members, local residents and education groups.",News/UK news,Stonehenge exhibition explores parallels with Japanese stone circles,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/04/stonehenge-exhibition-explores-parallels-with-japanese-stone-circles
5/4/2022,"The buy now, pay later company Klarna will start reporting UK customer debts to credit agencies for the first time next month, in a move that could affect shoppers’ credit ratings from 2023. The move is understood to be the result of two years of talks with the credit reference companies Experian and TransUnion, and comes as buy now, pay later (BNPL) firms face pressure from MPs and campaigners who say they should prevent customers from taking on more debt than they can afford. The Swedish financial company, which is the leading BNPL provider in the UK with 16 million customers, will start sharing customer data with the two agencies from 1 June, meaning credit card companies will be able to see transactions and debts when conducting formal checks on potential borrowers. However, debts and repayments will only start affecting customer credit scores after 18 months, meaning the change will not have any formal impact until the end of 2023. BNPL products, which allow customers to delay or spread the cost of purchases, are not yet regulated in the UK, and new rules for the burgeoning sector may not come into effect until 2023. But Klarna’s agreement, which will mean reporting customer transactions on items such as clothes, food and furniture to the two firms from July, will put pressure on rivals to follow suit. Most large purchase schemes, which allow customers to spread costs over six to 36 months, are already reported to credit agencies. The agreements could result in some customers shunning Klarna and turning to rival BNPL providers in order to hide mounting debts from credit card companies and credit reference agencies. However, Klarna does not believe many customers will be deterred, and instead is focused on how the move will deal a further blow to big banks, since responsible borrowers will be able to build credit scores without taking out high-interest credit cards. Klarna said: “Consumers who make payments on time can build a positive credit history, showing lenders they use credit responsibly.” Alex Marsh, the head of Klarna UK, said: “It is alarming that UK consumers are still being forced to take out high-cost credit cards to demonstrate they can use credit responsibly and build their credit profile. That will start to change on 1 June this year as the vast majority of the 16 million UK consumers who make Klarna BNPL payments in full and on time will be able to demonstrate their responsible use of credit to other lenders.”",News/Business,Klarna to start reporting UK customer debts to credit agencies,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/04/klarna-to-start-reporting-uk-customer-debts-to-credit-agencies

5/4/2022,"Canoeists are campaigning for a right to “blue spaces”, with fewer than 4% of England’s rivers open to the public. Paddlers have described being shouted at and even subjected to physical abuse for passing through some stretches of river during their exercise. A patchwork of landowners having rights over tiny lengths of river, which makes it almost impossible to create routes for swimming and boating without land reform, campaigners have said. Ben Seal, campaign manager at British Canoeing, said: “The law is currently unclear so we have been campaigning to get those waterways opened up so people get fair and equal access to the blue spaces around us. People don’t know if they are trespassing, they are threatened often and coerced off the river. We have a tiny percentage of area where people can freely paddle.” There has been a large increase in the number of people wanting to use England’s rivers recreationally – membership of British Canoeing jumped from 36,500 to 93,000 in a year. But canoeists are often threatened by landowners for paddling through their land. “Some of our members have faced physical violence,” Seal said. Currently, the rules about access to rivers are negotiated locally, and recreational users need landowners’ permission to pass through rivers that run through their property. But there are problems with this. Seal explains: “If you are looking at a 10-mile stretch of river, there could be hundreds of people to negotiate access agreements with. This would be completely unworkable.” Philip Dunne, Conservative MP for Ludlow and chair of the House of Commons environmental audit committee, said that as rivers become cleaner and are awarded bathing status, more access should be granted. “Every community in the country should have access to waters – whether coastal or inland – that are safe for people to swim in without running the risk of falling ill,” he said. “As bathing water quality is achieved in more rivers, recreational users should be able to access these spaces easily.” Ministers in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), including the MP for Taunton Deane, Rebecca Pow, have called for more rivers to get bathing status, meaning the water quality must be monitored and logged. Members of British Canoeing will this summer start a campaign to clean up rivers, including litter picking in local areas. They argue they bring a net good to waterways and are far less of a danger to the health of rivers than problems such as sewage pollution and agricultural run-off. In fact, many swimmers and other recreational users of waterways have led the charge against sewage pollution, leading to a law change last year meaning that water companies have a legal duty to reduce sewage outflows. Seal said: “Flip it around and if all rivers were accessible and open to people to enjoy, just think of the amount of people that would then be engaged and care for the health of the river. It is interesting when you stack up the harm actually caused by recreational users of the countryside against the harm caused by those who are the custodians of the land; some farmers, landowners, water companies and industry.” Defra sources said there were no plans to change the current system, and that those wishing to use rivers would have to negotiate with landowners. They added that they “recognise that taking to our inland waters can have a positive effect on physical and mental wellbeing, as well as offer opportunities to improve the water environment.”",News/Environment,Canoeists make waves about right to paddle in English rivers,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/04/canoeists-make-waves-about-right-to-paddle-in-english-rivers
5/4/2022,"Yelena Yemchuk was 11 years old in 1981, when her family emigrated to the US from Ukraine. “I understood enough to know I’d never see anyone there again,” she writes in the short, evocative afterword to her new photobook, Odesa. “My heart broke. That was the end of my childhood.” Yemchuk’s parents grew up in the aftermath of the second world war and lived though the Soviet era, which they assumed would also define and constrict the lives of their children if they remained in Kyiv. Ten years after they left, though, the unimaginable happened and, in the dizzying aftermath of perestroika, Ukraine declared independence. On returning there in 2003, Yemchuk travelled to Odesa for the first time and experienced at first hand the wonderful “chaos of a new nation”. She recalls going to the beach and “everywhere I looked it was like a Fellini movie – beautiful kids having a birthday party, a crazy woman walking with a pink balloon, a girl dressed as a mermaid. I had brought three rolls of film and, after five minutes, I had to run back and get more.” At that moment, she says, “my photographic language was born.” The images in her book were shot on several return visits to the city between 2014 and 2019, in the wake of mass protests against the pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych, and the first Russian separatist attacks in Donbas near the eastern border with Russia. They are a vivid glimpse of the vibrant youth culture of Odesa, a city that Yemchuk describes as “unlike any other – a wild place, so free and open, mysterious and beautiful.” But they also capture the sense of being caught between an uncertain past and a fragile present. When we spoke, Odesa had thus far escaped the carnage visited on other Ukrainian cities, but was under sporadic missile attack from Russian warships in the Black Sea. Since the outbreak of war it has been transformed into a fortress, its streets almost deserted and eerily silent. A port of historic and strategic importance, Odesa is currently a city in limbo. Yemchuk grows tearful as she speaks of the fate that may await it. “The Ukrainian people are not going to give in,” she says. “They have tasted freedom and they are never going to go back to how it was before, but Putin cannot handle the fact that they want nothing to do with Russia.” In many ways, then, her photobook is an ode to a heady, youthful freedom that may yet prove to be short-lived, her camera catching the city’s vibrant character in intimate portraits, atmospheric interiors and snatched moments. Although her subjects have inevitably absorbed some aspects of western youth culture – tattoos, trainers, skateboards – they exude a bohemian otherness that is the very antithesis of hipsterism. “There was a lack of self-consciousness and openness there that is immediately apparent,” she elaborates. “As a photographer, you are drawn to these kids for who they are, the way they freely express themselves. It was so soulful there that it made me think of how so many cities have become so similar in the last 30 years or so, but not Odesa – it just feels wonderfully out of time.” Yemchuk’s interest in photography began when her father gave her a camera as a 14th birthday present. She went on to study at Parson School of Design in New York before becoming a video director and painter. In 2011 she published her first photobook, Gidropark, which was shot in and around a recreational space on the Dnieper River in Kyiv, where she had spent summers as a child. The book established a personal style, a merging of the dreamlike and the realist, that was markedly different to her previous fashion photography. Odesa builds on and deepens that approach. “In terms of composition, I wanted my photographs to be cinematic,” she says, “so as to capture the colours, the light, the strangeness and the ethereal, dreamlike connection I had with the city and its people.” In 2015, Yemchuk realised that many young people in Odesa were joining the army in response to the annexation of Crimea the previous year, and soon after she was granted access to the youth training programme in the Odesa Military Academy. “Back then, I still did not know what the project was going to be, but it soon grew into photos of the city, not just the military school.” Some of the most poignant portraits in her book are of the youngest recruits: an angelic, smiling girl in an outsized uniform; young boys whose stern expressions cannot mask their callowness. “Many of them told me, ‘We have no choice, we just have to do what we can to defend our country,’” she says. Now, of course, those portraits possess an even more poignant undertow. “It is six or seven years later,” she continues, “so there is a 90% chance that they are fighting in the war. Who knows what has happened to them?” The book is punctuated by texts from the Ukrainian-born poet Ilya Kaminsky, including one that attests to Odesa’s complex identity by citing its hybrid dialect, which is neither Russian, Ukrainian nor Yiddish but has elements of all three. Kaminsky describes it as “a city of immigrants built by immigrants for immigrants”, which may in part explain the particular character that Yemchuk was so drawn to, and inspired by. Her initial excitement about the project has now been replaced by a sense of uncertainty. “Photography is an agreement between me and the subject and, in one way, it’s the last thing I want for the book to come out now,” she explains. “But I also think it is important to put a human face on a place that is constantly being presented as war-torn. I hope my images show a city that is so far away and so different, but so recognisable, too. What I am trying to say is, ‘These are young people and this is their country and their lives. It is important to see that, to know what may be lost.’” Odesa by Yelena Yemchuk is published by Gost.",Arts/Art and design,"‘Everywhere I looked, it was like a Fellini movie’ … the youth of Odesa, photographed before the invasion",https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/04/fellini-movie-young-odesa-photographed-before-invasion-ukraine-war
5/4/2022,"A new rule introduced for this year’s World Surf League has proved as brutal as expected, with several big-name Australians falling victim to the mid-season cut during competition at the Margaret River Pro. Emotions have run high in Western Australia this week as Sally Fitzgibbons, Owen Wright and Morgan Cibilic all lost their Championship Tour status due to the rule change, which has delivered on Tour organisers’ promises to provide more drama and increased pressure. Tokyo Olympian Fitzgibbons dropped off the main tour for the first time in 14 years and 108 consecutive events after failing to progress beyond the round of 16, while Cibilic, who finished fifth in the world last year, was also demoted to the second-tier Challenger Series. Fitzgibbons was visibly upset after falling to Frenchwoman Johanne Defay, who was also in tears as she consoled the Australian in the water. “The unconditional love that comes with putting on my jersey #89. Everything about this sport, the surf community and my dream keeps me coming back for more,” Fitzgibbons wrote on social media afterwards. “I felt every one of those cheers and hugs from you yesterday and hope I can reciprocate when we cross paths in your big moment.” The fate of Wright, the Olympic bronze medallist, was finally sealed on Wednesday when Matthew McGillivray beat Miguel Pupo in their round-of-16 match-up. A day earlier, the prospect of dropping off the tour for the first time in 12 years had left a devastated Wright apparently considering his future in the sport. “I know I’m surfing really well, but I’ve got a lot of life outside of the tour – kids and wife and what not,” Wright said. “Whatever I do will be a family decision. We’ll kind of go through the motions of what’s next. There’s a lot more questions to be had. We’ll see what happens. All three Australians will now head to the Gold Coast for this weekend’s Challenger Series event as they seek a way back from the minor leagues to the 2023 Championship Tour. Joining the trio at Snapper Rocks will be the Brazilian rookie Joao Chianca, who also suffered heartbreak and broke down after being beaten by Italo Ferreira. “Can I be honest, I really wish I could go home and not do anything right now for the next few days,” Chianca said. “It’s all about finding hope in the hopeless. I’m not going to give up so soon. I’m still young and definitely have a lot to learn.” The WSL introduced the mid-season cut for this year’s tour to reduce the men’s and women’s fields from 36 and 18 to 24 and 12 respectively at the season’s midway point. In announcing the plan last year, tour organisers said the move would allow events to run within the most optimal swell cycles at locations like Indonesia’s G-Land (the next stop on the tour) and J-Bay in South Africa, “as well as ensure that the stars of the sport meet head to head more frequently”. Kolohe Andino was one of the lucky ones, making it through with victory over another Australian, Jackson Baker, but the American said the rule is proving unpopular with the athletes. “It’s just kind of hard the whole cut thing. No one really likes it,” Andino told the WSL broadcast. “We’re all friends on tour and we all love each other, so you don’t want to knock the guy off tour. “It just seems like it’s a TV show a little bit, like drama all the time.

5/4/2022,"When the 12th Earl of Strathmore, a 19th-century nimby who made an immense fortune from coal, refused to allow trains across his Gibside estate, the North Eastern Railway adopted an expensive alternative route via four viaducts and a cutting. After the line closed in 1962 it became the Derwent Walk Country Park, beloved by ramblers, runners, dog walkers, cyclists, horse riders and birdwatchers. The view from the parapet of the Nine Arches viaduct, spanning the River Derwent’s gorge, is exhilarating: a vibrant pointillist canvas of a tree canopy, painted with bursting leaf buds; an earthbound opportunity to see woodland from the perspective of the red kite that soared over my head this morning. At the western end of the viaduct, the path enters the long cutting. Its steep, wooded banks are bright with primroses, golden saxifrage, wood anemones and violets. Hidden among them, I found rough horsetail, or Dutch rush, a living fossil whose antecedents thrived in the Carboniferous period, 300m years ago, long before flowers evolved. It’s a leafless, flowerless, knee-high thicket of green, hollow, corrugated stems, thinner than a pencil. In spring, some are tipped with bullet-shaped spore cones, clothed in tiny polygonal tiles that separate and release microscopically small wind-borne spores, each with four arms called elaters that unwind and act as sails. One of evolution’s minimalist efforts, but what a story it has to tell. Horsetail stems have a high silica content, so fossilise well. Fragments of rough horsetail’s giant ancestors, some as tall as today’s forest trees, once trundled past here in railway wagons, embedded in the millions of tons of coal they transported from Durham coalfields to colliers moored at staithes on the Tyne. Since the Nine Arches viaduct was built, Gibside Hall – the Strathmore stately home – has become a romantic ruin, now in the care of the National Trust. Coal-based industries that once filled this rewilded valley lie hidden under woodland, lakes and cowslip-filled meadows. But rough horsetail endures, a living testament to a tropical landscape of giant horsetails that still influences our lives. Carbon dioxide released from burning these disinterred ancestors is changing the climate of our planet.

5/4/2022,"Outside the US supreme court the morning after a bombshell leak revealed justices are poised to overturn Roe v Wade, the day began with dozens of protesters. By the afternoon, thousands had arrived to make their voices heard – with many on opposite sides of America’s abortion debate. The possibility of a repeal of the landmark 1973 decision brought energized and sometimes emotional supporters of Roe to protests in major cities from New York to San Francisco. But the supreme court was ground zero. Members of the US Capitol police closed the street in front of the supreme court building as protesters filled and took over the area, holding signs and large banners. It was a tense atmosphere that brought anti-abortion and pro-choice protesters into close range, outside the building where nine of the most powerful individuals in the US decide the nation’s future. “I’m here because I was here in 2016 and couldn’t fucking believe that I had to tell people that women are people – but clearly we do,” said Cindy from Great Falls, Virginia, who asked that her last name be withheld. While she didn’t expect to change the court’s mind, she said, “it’s really nice to see a bunch of like minded people and get the vibe and I’m pissed – that’s why I’m here – I’m pissed”. “I hope that this will motivate people to vote because I think that’s the only thing that’s gonna help,” she added. As the number of protesters built steadily throughout the morning, Democratic senators gathered nearby on the Senate steps for a press conference. “This is a five alarm fire,” said Senator Patty Murray, as demonstrators’ chants rang out across the grassy lawn separating the capitol from the supreme court. While Democrats are already discussing legislation to codify abortion into the law, those on the anti-abortion side of the debate were relieved to hear Roe could be overturned, and often cited religious concerns. A young Black woman, who asked to be quoted anonymously for privacy reasons, said she came from the suburbs near the nation’s Capitol and that she opposed abortion. “I’m realizing that if people don’t stand for people who can’t stand up for themselves, then we’re not really American. I’m here not representing any political party or any side or left or right or whatever. I’m here to just stand for Jesus and that we are made in the image of God,” she said, standing on the sidewalk outside the supreme court and holding a handmade sign. “I did the Black Lives Matter protest because I believe in the sanctity of life and I have to keep that same energy. If you believe in life, it’s sacred at all times. George Floyd mattered in his mother’s womb and he mattered the day he was executed.” Alan Cohen, who said he lived in the local area, echoed similar religious concerns. “What brings me out here is obedience to Jesus Christ. I’m a Christian, and God commands us to go and make disciples of all the nations, including the United States,” Cohen said. “So in big events like this, especially ones that are very emotionally charged, our calling is to proclaim the Gospel, whether or not the crowd is popular with it or not. That’s our obedience and call as Christians,” he added. While the supreme court’s decision is not yet final, the leak of the draft is set to further enflame political division ahead of the midterm elections. “Our country is experiencing a full partisan assault on women’s rights and freedom to control our own bodies,” said Melanie Campbell, convener of the Black Women’s Roundtable, which often polls a vital voting block for Democrats. “As Black women, we stand at the intersection of voting rights and reproductive justice, with the full understanding that the struggle for our right to vote is inextricably tied to our reproductive rights as women.” The midterms will decide the fate of who controls the US Congress and will be held in November. If the supreme court overturns Roe, impact at the ballot box is widely predicted. Senator Bernie Sanders, standing inside the US Capitol, described it as a make or break moment for the Democratic party. “What the Democrats have to do is rally the American people around something the American people feel strongly about. There is very strong majority support that a woman has the right to control their own bodies and that Roe v. Wade should not be repealed.”",News/US news,Tears and tension as protesters swarm outside US supreme court,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/03/roe-v-wade-protests-outside-us-supreme-court
