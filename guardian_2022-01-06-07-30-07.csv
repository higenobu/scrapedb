1/6/2022,"You have to hand it to Tottenham defenders. Whatever their faults, at least nobody can doubt their entertainment value. After all they even managed to pull off the impossible during the first leg of this Carabao Cup semi-final, somehow dragging the spotlight away from Chelsea’s extremely apologetic record signing with a performance of spectacular slapstick at the back.  This must have been a form of rare torture for Antonio Conte. Even with Romelu Lukaku straining for touch and composure, Chelsea were dominant after welcoming their former manager back to Stamford Bridge for the first time. Thomas Tuchel had come up trumps after being forced to tweak his system and Conte cut a glum figure as half-time approached, his mood hardly helped by the farcical own goal that eased Chelsea into a 2-0 lead after 34 minutes of one‑way traffic. It had been wretched from Spurs, who were dismal without Eric Dier and Cristian Romero at the back. Pierre-Emile Højbjerg and Oliver Skipp were being pulled all over the place in central midfield, the movement of Mason Mount and Hakim Ziyech a constant problem, and the vulnerabilities at the back were evident even before Kai Havertz fired Chelsea ahead in the fifth minute. The gaps had appeared from Chelsea’s first attack. Lukaku, back in the side after annoying Tuchel by accidentally pledging his undying love to Internazionale, had something to prove. The time for talking was over and the £97.5m forward was involved in the first minute, tearing down the right flank before letting Spurs off the hook with a poor cross. Still, it was a moment of promise for Chelsea. Always creative, Tuchel had a solution after the absence of Reece James, Ben Chilwell, Andreas Christensen and Trevoh Chalobah was compounded by Thiago Silva and N’Golo Kanté testing positive for Covid-19. The German had not veered away from a back three all season but he adjusted here, paying homage to Ralf Rangnick by switching to a 4‑2‑2‑2, a change that gave Lukaku more support and left Spurs all at sea. Conte, who got the best out of Lukaku when he managed him at Inter, had not seen it coming. With Jorginho and Saúl Ñíguez assured in midfield for Chelsea, Spurs had no way out and they looked nervy with Havertz under instructions to play near Lukaku during the early stages. The curiosity of that move from Tuchel is that Lukaku – who describes himself as a “multidimensional” forward – has often looked isolated this season. The Belgian has pined for his partnership with Lautaro Martínez, his former Inter teammate, and has struggled to live up to expectations since returning to Stamford Bridge. Tuchel, however, has repeatedly rejected suggestions that he has changed his system since signing Lukaku; as the German has pointed out, sharp-eyed observers will have noticed Chelsea used a 3‑4‑2‑1 when they won the Champions League last season. Nonetheless this was no time to be rigid. Tuchel had only four fit senior defenders – in came the lesser spotted Malang Sarr to partner Antonio Rüdiger in central defence – so it made sense to bolster his attack by using Ziyech and Mount as roving No 10s. Spurs, arranged in a staid 3-4-3, were confused. After five minutes Japhet Tanganga tried to play out from the back. The pass was too short and Marcos Alonso quickly stole in front of Emerson Royal before slipping in Havertz, who beat Hugo Lloris with the aid of a deflection off Davinson Sánchez. At that point it was worth remembering Lukaku is not the only expensive Chelsea forward who has struggled to fire under Tuchel. After all, what is Havertz’s best position? Is he a target man? A No 10? A false nine? And just when will the £62m German build on his winner in the Champions League final to produce a consistent run of form? Perhaps this, a goal against Chelsea’s fiercest rivals, will be a moment of ignition for Havertz. He was excellent before going off at half-time, troubling Spurs by drifting to the left to combine with Mount and Alonso, and he could have scored again after another wretched mix-up from Conte’s side. Spurs could barely put a foot right. Harry Kane was barely allowed a sniff by Rüdiger and although Lukaku toiled at times, his difficulties encapsulated by the moment when he ran the ball out for a throw and tripped over his own feet, Chelsea were always on top. A second goal felt inevitable and it arrived when Ziyech’s inswinging free-kick led to more comedy, Tanganga’s attempted headed clearance bouncing off Ben Davies and flying past Lloris. There was no way back for Spurs from there. Lukaku could have increased their pain when he headed wide and, although Spurs improved after the break, Chelsea are in control before the second leg next week. It is up to Conte to find the answers.",Sport/Football,Absurd Tottenham mistakes deflect spotlight away from Romelu Lukaku,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/05/absurd-tottenham-mistakes-deflect-spotlight-away-from-romelu-lukaku
1/6/2022,"The former US talkshow host Jon Stewart has claimed there are antisemitic tropes in the depictions of the goblins who run Gringotts bank in the Harry Potter franchise. In a recent episode of his podcast, Stewart, who hosted The Daily Show for 16 years, and is Jewish, compared the depiction of the goblins in Harry Potter to the antisemitic illustrations in the 1903 book The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.  “Talking to people, what I say is: Have you ever seen a ‘Harry Potter’ movie? Have you ever seen the scenes in Gringotts Bank? Do you know what those folks who run the bank are? Jews! And they’re like, ‘Oh, [that illustration is] from ‘Harry Potter!’ “And you’re like, ‘No, that’s a caricature of a Jew from an antisemitic piece of literature.’ JK Rowling was like, ‘Can we get these guys to run our bank?’ It’s a wizarding world … we can ride dragons, you can have a pet owl … but who should run the bank? Jews. But what if the teeth were sharper?” Describing watching Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, which was released 20 years ago, Stewart added: “It was one of those things where I saw it on the screen and I was expecting the crowd to be like, ‘Holy shit, [Rowling] did not, in a wizarding world, just throw Jews in there to run the fucking underground bank.’” Stewart sought to quell the intense reaction to the clip in a new video on Wednesday. “Let me just say this as clearly as I can,” Stewart said in the video uploaded to Twitter, “I do not think JK Rowling is antisemitic. I did not accuse her of being antisemitic. I do not think that the Harry Potter movies are antisemitic.” Many Jewish fans and groups, including the charity Campaign Against Antisemitism, defended Rowling on Wednesday for being “a tireless defender of the Jewish community in its fight against antisemitism”. Campaign Against Antisemtism said the portrayal of the goblins “is of a piece with their portrayal with western literature as a whole … Those who continue to use such representations are often not thinking of Jews at all, but simply of how readers or viewers will imagine goblins to look, which is a testament more to centuries of Christendom’s antisemitism than it is to malice by contemporary artists”.

1/6/2022,"It was not how Antonio Conte had envisaged his return to Chelsea, the club where he enjoyed such success for two seasons before everything went bang, his departure marked by acrimony and a long-running legal case. Everything had gone pretty smoothly and impressively for Conte on the domestic front since his arrival at Tottenham in early November but this was quite the unravelling, the only consolation being that his team are still just about alive ahead of the second leg of this Carabao Cup semi-final.  Spurs’s defending in the first half was almost impossibly bad. If Kai Havertz’s early opener owed much to their looseness, the second was entirely down to it, Japhet Tanganga’s attempted clearing header smacking into Ben Davies and flying in for a darkly comic own goal. It was not Romelu Lukaku’s night. The Chelsea striker was restored to the starting XI after the fallout from his controversial interview and he struggled to make an impression, save for a couple of flashes; his finishing hurried, his moves a little predictable. He could be happy that the focus was elsewhere as Thomas Tuchel took a firm stride towards winning his third semi-final out of three at Chelsea. Spurs have won nothing since 2008 and, on this evidence, they will not end the drought this season. All eyes had been on the big returnees and all ears on the receptions that they would get. It was muted for Lukaku when his name was announced before kick-off while Conte rather snuck in under the radar as the lights were off for the pre-match show. Chelsea brought the energy at the outset, much to Conte’s frustration. The breakthrough goal was all about the hustle from those in blue, not to mention a little uncertainty from Spurs’s right-sided centre-half, Tanganga, who gave Emerson Royal a pass out of defence that he did not want. Marcos Alonso was onto him in a flash, winning the ball and playing in Havertz behind Tanganga, who appeared to want to wait for Hugo Lloris to come and clear. It was never going to happen and Havertz shot low past the goalkeeper, the ball going in off Davinson Sánchez. Lukaku had chased on to a Havertz flick before that, only to miss the cutback for his strike partner and Chelsea were on the front foot in imposing style in their new-look 4-2-2-2 system. Tuchel had been able to count upon only four defenders – Thiago Silva the latest absentee with Covid (the virus also ruled out the midfielder, N’Golo Kanté) – which is a bit of a problem when his preferred system involves playing a five. Hence the back four for the first time this season. It was Spurs in their regular 3-4-2-1 formation who looked like strangers during a torrid first half, which was summed up by the second Chelsea goal. When Hakim Ziyech whipped in a free-kick from the right, the ball was in front of all of his teammates. No matter. Davies had leapt to contest it and he could not adjust his body when Tanganga thumped an attempted clearing header into him, the ricochet flying back and into Lloris’s goal. Conte stood motionless on the touchline, silently stewing, because it had not been an isolated moment of slapstick defending from his team. Far from it. Havertz had earlier blown a clear chance for 2-0 after Pierre-Emile Højbjerg hit Oliver Skipp with a clearance and watched the ball break for the Chelsea attacker. It was no exaggeration to say that the tie could have been over at half-time. Chelsea had pot shots from around the area, with Mason Mount seeing two charged down but it should have been 3-0 in the 41st minute when Ziyech drifted over a cross for Lukaku, who had got in front of Sánchez. He rose and glanced a header just past the post. Conte was spoilt for choice in terms of who to remove at the interval but he limited himself to just one change – hooking Matt Doherty, who had laboured out of position at left wing-back, and introducing Tanguy Ndombele. The eye-catching move was the switch to 4-2-3-1. Tuchel was not the only manager to break his religion of three centre-halves. Spurs took up higher starting positions, which they had failed to do in the first half when Højbjerg and Skipp were worried about Ziyech and Mount getting in between the lines and the team sunk back. The visitors began to rebuild their confidence, piecing together a few passing moves, with Ndombele making a difference in the No 10 role. He won a free-kick from Malang Sarr on the edge of the area, from which Harry Kane worked Kepa Arrizabalaga. But Chelsea continued to threaten. Ziyech sidefooted straight at Lloris after a sweeping move, defined by Lukaku’s nice pass to him on the overlap, while Timo Werner – on for the injured Havertz – curled past the far post. Werner also watched Lloris save his lob after Ziyech’s defence-splitting pass.",Sport/Football,Kai Havertz and slapstick Tottenham defending give Chelsea first-leg victory,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/05/chelsea-tottenham-carabao-cup-semi-final-first-leg-match-report
1/6/2022,"The US attorney general, Merrick Garland, on Wednesday vowed that the justice department would hold accountable everyone responsible for the deadly 6 January attack on the US Capitol. Garland’s remarks come as he faces growing calls from lawmakers, legal experts and former elected officials to intensify the department’s investigation into the events of 6 January, and in particular, to prosecute those who helped orchestrate the failed attempt to overturn the 2020 election results, including the former president and his associates.  In a solemn speech marking the first anniversary of the assault on the seat of government, Garland said it did not matter whether the perpetrators were present at the Capitol riot or committed other crimes that wrought chaos on that day. “The justice department remains committed to holding all January 6th perpetrators, at any level, accountable under law – whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy,” Garland said in his remarks, delivered from the justice department’s Great Hall in Washington. “We will follow the facts wherever they lead.” Garland recounted in detail the brutality of the day, contesting a rightwing revisionist narrative that the attack was not violent. Officers were assaulted with pipes and poles, beaten and shocked with stun guns. One officer, he said, was dragged down the stairs by rioters, while lawmakers and the vice-president fled for their lives. “As a consequence, proceedings in both chambers were disrupted for hours – interfering with a fundamental element of American democracy: the peaceful transfer of power from one administration to the next,” he said. “Those involved must be held accountable, and there is no higher priority for us at the Department of Justice.” Garland did not mention Donald Trump by name, and in keeping with the justice department’s longstanding rule not to comment on ongoing investigations, he did not detail any possible leads the department was pursuing related to the former US president, his family or his allies. He said he understood the intense public interest in the case, and promised that the actions taken by the department so far “will not be our last”. Garland said the department was laying the foundation for more “complex” cases by pursuing prosecutions against more “straightforward” ones. “In complex cases, initial charges are often less severe than later charged offenses,” he said. “This is purposeful, as investigators methodically collect and sift through more evidence.” The investigation into the events of 6 January is one of the “largest, most complex and most resource-intensive investigations” in the nation’s history, Garland said, outlining its scope. To date, he said investigators had issued 5,000 subpoenas and search warrants; seized 2,000 devices, viewed 20,000 hours of video footage, searched 15 terabytes of data and received 300,000 tips from the public. More than 700 people in nearly all 50 states and the District of Columbia have been charged for their roles in the insurrection, which left 140 law enforcement officers injured. Five officers who defended the Capitol that day have since died. Reading their names aloud, Garland asked for a moment of silence to remember the fallen officers. On Thursday, Democratic leaders in Congress will host a day of remembrance events, beginning with speeches from Biden and Kamala Harris at the US Capitol. Previewing his speech, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said Biden would acknowledge “the singular responsibility President Trump has for the chaos and carnage” of 6 January. “The president is going to speak to the truth of what happened, not the lies that some have spread since and the peril it posed to the rule of law and our system of democratic governance,” Psaki said, adding that Biden was “clear-eyed about the threat the former president represents to our democracy and how the former president constantly works to undermine basic American values and rule of law”. Garland’s remarks extended beyond the events of 6 January. He lamented a rise in violence that has touched nearly every aspect of American life. He pointed to attacks on elections officials, airline crews, teachers, journalists, police officers, judges and members of Congress. “These acts and threats of violence are not associated with any one set of partisan or ideological views,” he warned. “But they are permeating so many parts of our national life that they risk becoming normalized and routine if we do not stop them.”",News/US news,Merrick Garland vows to pursue all those responsible for 6 January attack,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/05/merrick-garland-us-capitol-attack-investigation
