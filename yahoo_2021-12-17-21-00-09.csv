12/17/2021,"Jonah Goldberg, one of two conservative commentators who resigned from Fox News last month in protest of prime time personality Tucker Carlson’s “dangerous” rhetoric, published a scathing critique of his former employer on Thursday. In an essay for The Dispatch, Goldberg said he’d shown “a good deal of restraint” with not commenting on the network since his departure with fellow pundit Stephen Hayes. But “screw it,” he wrote in his op-ed published via the conservative digital media company he co-founded in 2020. “A huge share of the people” praising former President Donald Trump on TV were being dishonest because “they would say one thing to my face or in my presence and another thing when the cameras and microphones were flipped on,” claimed Goldberg. Over time, he added, he felt “like I was becoming complicit in a series of lies of omission.” Goldberg singled out host Laura Ingraham for particular criticism, highlighting the stark difference between her private text message to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows during the U.S. Capitol riot, when she urged Meadows to get then-President Trump to call his supporters off, and her downplaying of the violence on air. Ingraham has “spent the next 11 months cleaning up the president’s mess,” he added. Read Goldberg’s full essay here. This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

12/17/2021,"By Andrius Sytas and John O'Donnell VILNIUS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - China is pressuring German car parts giant Continental to stop using components made in Lithuania, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters, amid a dispute between Beijing and the Baltic state over the status of Taiwan. The targeting of Continental is an example of how the China-Lithuania diplomatic spat is spilling over into business in an era of global supply chains and affecting Germany's car industry, a lucrative pillar of Europe's biggest economy. The Chinese government, which views self-ruled Taiwan as its territory, downgraded diplomatic ties with Lithuania last month after the opening of a representative office by Taiwan in Vilnius. Lithuania's ruling coalition had also agreed last year to support what it described as ""those fighting for freedom"" on the island. Continental, one of the world's largest car parts maker, has production facilities in Lithuania, making electronic parts such as controllers for vehicle doors and seats, and exports to clients globally including China. Continental, which supplies all of Germany's big automakers, declined to comment on whether it had been asked by the Chinese government to cut links with Lithuania. China's foreign ministry denied that Beijing had pressured multinational companies not to use Lithuanian-produced parts though said its companies no longer trusted Lithuania. ""The practice of 'one China, one Taiwan' grossly interferes in China's internal affairs and seriously violates China's core interests,"" a spokesperson added. ""I heard that many Chinese companies no longer regard Lithuania as a trustworthy partner,"" the spokesperson said. ""Lithuania has to look at itself for the reason why Lithuanian companies are facing difficulties in trade and economic cooperation in China."" China has pressured countries to downgrade or sever their relations with democratically governed Taiwan. Earlier this month, a senior official and an industry body said China had told multinationals to sever ties with Lithuania or face being shut out of the Chinese market. Lithuania's direct trade with China is modest, but its export-based economy is home to hundreds of companies that make products such as furniture, lasers, food and clothing for multinationals that sell to China. Lithuania's foreign office said: ""Companies operating in Lithuania have successfully integrated themselves into international supply chains, so China's economic pressure measures may cause various disruptions to companies operating in Lithuania."" ""We closely monitor, analyse and evaluate each such case, including among these German companies,"" said the spokesperson, adding that it was ""looking for long-term sustainable solutions and ways to resume trade flows with China"".

Asian American women have a higher median income than white men, but one statistic can never provide enough context to make a point about race in the United States.

Polemic opinion writer Rav Arora, a self-identified Sikh and contributor for the New York Post, capitalized on the model minority myth to produce another derivative opinion piece arguing that white supremacy doesn’t exist. In this particular op-ed, he writes that because Asian American women have a higher median income than white men in the U.S., white supremacy must not exist.

Five days later on Dec. 16, conservative commentator Lauren Chen made a similar argument in an RT piece with the same statistic, with the additional assertion that because Asian women are so fiscally successful, soon the American left will simply consider them white.

The model minority myth

The model minority myth posits that Asian Americans have inherent traits or value systems that allow them to be successful in the U.S., whereas other people of color do not but should. The term was created by a white man in the 1970s to deliberately drive a wedge in between minority communities during a period of high Asian immigration when the U.S. specifically welcomed highly-educated immigrants.

The myth has been disproven again and again and again. Not only is it blatantly misleading, but it’s also damaging to Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) and other communities of color. Although deployed to disprove white supremacy, the model minority myth is a creation and tool of that system.

Median income is not a clear indicator

In this latest iteration of the model minority myth, Arora and Chen base their entire arguments around a single metric: median income. According to data from the Census Bureau in 2019, Asian women have a higher median income than white men in the U.S. This one statistic, however, misrepresents the complexity of the situation. The simple argument that Asian American women are “better off” than white men ignores incredible complexity within the AAPI identity and community.

While certain groups of Asian Americans are indeed financially successful, in particular those of East Asian and Indian descent, the median income for other groups is far lower. The highest earners among AAPI women are Indian women, with a median annual earning of $60,879. Hmong women and Bangladeshi women, however, have a median annual income of $30,000 and $30,439 respectively. When looked at as an aggregate, Asian Americans are indeed doing relatively well, but the truth is that there are grave disparities within the community.

Almost twice as many Asian Americans have graduate or professional degrees as white Americans — according to the Washington Post, more than 50% of Asian Americans over the age of 25 have attained a bachelor’s degree or higher, compared to 33% of white Americans.

A more nuanced conversation

With that context, it’s evident that median income alone is far too vague a comparison. Another glaring issue with solely engaging with the median income statistic is that it doesn’t compare the outcomes of Asian women directly to those of white men working in the same industries. AAPI women face the smallest wage gap compared to other women, but they still only earn 88.5% of white men’s earnings. That amounts to an average of $400,000 in lost income over a 40-year career.

There are several other factors about these two opinion pieces which don’t make sense as well. White supremacy does not exist only in an economic framework; it is pervasive in other parts of our lives as well. There is more to racism than economics, although racism and economics are strongly linked, of course. Additionally, Asian women and white men are not the sole two demographic groups in America, and even within those groups, there are so many other factors that have to do with class, education, geography and even specific ethnicities that drawing conclusions about the entire country based on these two lumped-together groups alone is completely illogical.

There are insights we can gather from the median income statistic, but they come only from unpacking the larger context in which these numbers are situated. The extrapolations made by Arora and others on Twitter to disprove racism and white supremacy’s existence in our society don’t show the whole story because they’re designed to provoke, not inform.
