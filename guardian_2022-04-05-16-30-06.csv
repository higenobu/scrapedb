4/5/2022,"Australia Post trucks would be used to find mobile signal blackspots under Labor’s plan to conduct a $20m independent audit of mobile coverage if it wins the federal election. Speaking at a National Farmers’ Federation conference on Tuesday, the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, unveiled the party’s regional telecommunications policy, including fitting mobile signal measurement devices on Australia Post trucks. A centrepiece of the Coalition communications policy since 2013 has been the mobile blackspots program, with $380m invested and over 414,000 sq km of new coverage delivered as of February this year. The government’s existing program has operated on an application and grant basis. However, Labor’s policy would use data collected from the Australia Post trucks on coverage, call reliability and data availability for the three carriers – Optus, Telstra and Vodafone – to determine the best locations to upgrade. A trial of similar technology is under way in Austria, using Austria Post’s 8,000 vehicles and technology supplied by Ranlytics to measure 3G and 4G mobile connectivity on highways and main arterial roads, with plans to also test 5G. Mobile coverage blackspots outside metropolitan areas were a key complaint to the 2021 regional telecommunications review. While telcos say 99.5% of the population are covered by mobile networks, this equates to just 33% of Australia’s land mass and the committee raised concerns about the accuracy of the measurement. “Indeed, the committee has continued to hear of persistent mobile blackspots in many regional, rural and remote areas, particularly outside of regional centres, towns and transport corridors,” the report stated. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “This includes places like farming homesteads, local roads and national parks where there is demand for reliable mobile coverage to support productivity and public safety.” The New South Wales Rural Fire Service told the committee it was concerned at the number of blackspots often with limited internet or just 3G coverage, stating it “has caused significant stress for many residents and put … stress on emergency operations.” In the Morrison government’s response to the regional telecommunications review, it said independent audits of mobile coverage would be commissioned in 2022-23 and 2023-24, with the government considering “crowdsourcing” data on mobile network coverage and performance. In the federal budget last week, the communications minister, Paul Fletcher, announced $418m in new funding for regional connectivity, including addressing blackspots covering 8,000km of roads and nearby properties. Labor has pledged $400m for a fund for mobile connectivity on roads, regional homes and businesses that will be assessed by Infrastructure Australia, subject to community consultation. Labor has also promised $200m for improving regional and peri-urban connectivity through mobile and fixed line internet upgrades and has promised $30m to connect farms, and farming technology. “This is a comprehensive, targeted plan that will ensure better mobile coverage on roads, on farms and across regional communities, and better broadband too,” Albanese said. “This is critical to modern agriculture and making sure Australian farms are as efficient and competitive as they can be.” Vodafone said initiatives to improve mobile coverage are “welcome and overdue”. “The need for a better-connected regional Australia is a must, not a nice-to-have,” a Vodafone spokesperson said.

4/5/2022,"A cyber-attack targeting The Works has caused the closure of some of the retailer’s stores, delayed the resupply of stock and online order deliveries to customers. The cut-price seller of books, crafts and toys, which operates 520 stores across the UK, said that the security breach of its computer systems has not given hackers access to any customer payment data. “There has been some limited disruption to trading and business operations, including the closure of some stores due to till issues,” the company said. “Replenishment deliveries to the group’s stores were suspended temporarily and the normal delivery window for the fulfilment of online orders was extended, but store deliveries are expected to resume imminently and the normal online service levels are progressively being reintroduced.” The company said that as a precaution it has disabled internal and external access to its computer systems, including email, while it “works with its advisers to evaluate and rectify the situation”. The Works said that all debt and credit card transactions are processed outside its own systems by third parties so customer payment data has not been compromised by the attack. “Customers can continue to shop safely at The Works, both in store and online,” the company said. “There is no risk that this payment data has been accessed improperly.” However, the company, which has hired forensic cybersecurity experts to investigate the hack, said that it does not yet know if other data has been accessed. “While payment data has not been compromised, it has not yet been possible to establish the full extent to which any other data may have been affected,” the company said. “Therefore, as a precautionary measure, we have informed the Information Commissioner’s Office.” The London-listed business, which celebrated its 40th anniversary last year, said that it does not anticipate that the cyber-attack will have a material adverse impact on its forecasts or financial position. In February, KP Snacks, the maker of some of Britain’s most popular snacks including Hula Hoops, McCoy’s and Tyrrells crisps, Butterkist, Skips, Nik Naks and KP Nuts, said a cyber-attack could lead to supply issues until the end of March.",News/Business,The Works forced to close some stores after cyber-attack,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/05/the-works-close-stores-cyber-attack-uk-security-breach
4/5/2022,"The first time I almost choked to death was eight years ago. I’d just interviewed Gordon Brown and had a big barney with him. I got to see his famous temper in full fury when I asked him about Iraq while he wanted to talk about the Scottish referendum. I was upset. It was pissing down, dark, and I ended up in a Glasgow curry house by myself. I phoned up Murdo, the photographer on the assignment, while I was eating and took him through the interview bit by disastrous bit. A piece of naan stuck in my throat. Murdo was on the end of the line, hearing me retching. Then choking. I stumbled over to the bar, managed to force out the word “wa-er” and pointed to the tap. The waitress started slowly filling a pint glass to the top. The room was spinning, and I was about to pass out. I remember so clearly what was going through my head – I’m hundreds of miles from home, alone, I’ve had a standup row with one of Britain’s few political giants, and my partner Diane and I aren’t married so she might lose the house because of inheritance tax. What a shit way to die. I was waiting for the inevitable when a waiter wrapped me in his arms, and whacked me in my abdomen. Once, twice, thrice, four times and then it flew out across the room – the naan that was determined to see me off. My throat was too scratched to speak properly. I thanked him as best as I could, then I sat down and wept. The shock was so huge that I didn’t even feel the pain. I returned to my table and just sat there till the restaurant closed. The waiter asked if I was OK, ordered me a cab, and I thanked him again for saving my life. When I woke up the next day, my ribs were agony. However I moved, it hurt. But it seemed a small price to pay. I returned home, and never mentioned it to my family. I thought they would never let me go away on a job again. So I winced in silence, told them I’d slept badly. The least I could have done is taken a first aid course so I could help save somebody when the same thing happened to them. But I didn’t. Last month, my daughter Maya and I met my friend Priscilla in a London pub. It was the first time Priscilla had been out to eat since the pandemic started and we were determined to make a good time of it. I ordered starters, and the best steak in the house. After the first course, I received bad news – a cousin had died. I went outside to tell my mum and sister, and returned to the table. The steak had arrived – the thickest, juiciest steak you’ve ever seen. I talked about the call, got a bit emotional, and popped a bit of steak into my mouth and chewed. But not enough. This time round I knew that there was no way it was going down naturally or with water. I headed straight for the bar, again. I couldn’t get a single word out this time, I was losing oxygen so quickly. I pointed to my back, started hitting it, miming a plea for help. The trouble is when you’re choking you look batty or dangerous – the kind of person you want to steer well clear of. And they did. Priscilla tried to Heimlich me, but didn’t have the strength or knowhow. I was turning blue. Maya was watching. It was awful. Priscilla screamed that I was choking. Everybody in the packed pub looked up, stared at me, and did nothing. I stopped panicking. I just had a dreadful sense of resignation – it would be all over in a minute or so, life is good, I don’t want to die. Then I felt myself being grabbed from behind. A clenched fist locked into a hand wrapped tight around my abdomen – in and up it thrust, in and up, again and again. On the fifth thrust the piece of steak shot out with a splattering of sicky phlegm. Everybody in the pub clapped, which was incredibly gracious of them considering I must have put them off their meal. I lay on the floor exhausted. Maya was in tears, being comforted by a stranger. Priscilla and the waitress helped me up. I went outside, and we sat in silence. When I was in a fit state I went into the pub and asked who was my saviour. The man responsible told me he’d never done the Heimlich manoeuvre before, and that it was only when nobody else came forward that he thought he’d best have a try. My hero. I thought that being saved from choking once was lucky; twice was tempting fate. It was time to learn how to look after myself and others. I watched videos about how to do the Heimlich manoeuvre on others, and one showing how to Heimlich yourself using a chair – same principle, into your abdomen and upwards. According to recent Office for National Statistics figures, an average of 351 people die every year in the UK as a result of choking, and further analysis of reports published by coroners suggests the true toll is being hidden. Research commissioned by the Red Cross showed that 19 out of 20 of adults would be unable to save lives in first aid emergencies. The Red Cross, St John Ambulance and British Heart Foundation have called for it to be compulsory for every child to receive an hour of first aid education every year as part of their PSHE (personal, social, health and economic) education. It makes sense. It’s empowering, socially responsible, and saves lives. I would add that it should be compulsory for at least one member of staff on duty in eating or drinking establishments to know how to carry out the Heimlich manoeuvre. As for me, I’m off to book a first aid course. Simon Hattenstone is a features writer for the Guardian",Opinion/Opinion,Strangers saved me from choking to death – twice.

4/5/2022,"It is probably a source of minor encouragement that the Ricketts family – currently on the shortlist of potential buyers for Chelsea – have promised sceptical fans that they will not join a European Super League. Perhaps, by way of further commitment, the Ricketts will spurn other competitions that do not exist. Chelsea will never play in a future Anglo-Italian Cup. Chelsea wants no part of the Makita Trophy. Chelsea will never enter Pop Idol. Of course, prospective owners always arrive with a lavish manifesto of pledges and blandishments, lest anybody guess what they actually plan to do once they get through the door. Mike Ashley arrived at Newcastle promising “fun and trophies”, although crucially he never actually specified who for. Meanwhile, Ken Bates would probably have received a far cooler welcome from Chelsea fans in 1982 had he disclosed that within a few years he would be plotting to electrocute them with barbed wire fences. And so it is probably wise to treat the words of the Ricketts family – currently in smiling PR overdrive after some of their number were revealed to have said some extremely racist and homophobic things – with a few teaspoons of salt. In a way, their pre-emptive rebuff to a European Super League is less a concrete policy and more a form of robotised self-branding. Hello, fellow football lovers. We hear there is a “Super League” you dislike. We too dislike this thing, whatever it is. Be friends? With the threat of insurrection apparently seen off, we can now chortle at the forlorn attempts of Barcelona, Real Madrid and Juventus to reanimate the original defunct Super League concept, like lonely men continuing to insist that the punctured blow-up doll sitting next to them in Prezzo is, in fact, their real girlfriend. And yet, with a devastating deftness, the Super League has indeed returned. They’re just calling it something else. Last week, Uefa accelerated its plans to expand the Champions League from 32 to 36 teams from 2024, with two of the four additional places awarded to historically successful teams who would otherwise have failed to qualify. Based on current league positions, that would mean Roma and Arsenal, although Manchester United would also have a chance to qualify by finishing fifth in the Premier League. And really it is these sorts of clubs that are the intended beneficiaries here: the former giants fallen on hard times, superclubs enduring a poor season, not really good enough for the elite but invited in anyway. One proposal would see big teams able to secure Champions League football by winning the FA Cup. Had this rule existed ahead of the 2016 Cup final, for example, Manchester United would have been able to earn Champions Leaguequalification with a victory. Their opponents Crystal Palace would not. This was, in essence, the foundation stone of the Super League. It was a way of ensuring that whatever calamity befalls them – pandemic, mismanagement, financial catastrophe, appointing Ronald Koeman –Europe’s biggest clubs must never be allowed to worry about Champions League qualification again. Look again at the Super League proposals – a 180-game group stage, guaranteed berths for historical giants, the knockout stages played in a condensed four-week window at the end of the season – and what is striking is how little they differ from the changes currently being set in motion. The real impetus behind the reforms has been the European Clubs Association, currently under the chairmanship of Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser al-Khelaifi. Khelaifi did a rare round of interviews last week, and two major themes emerged from them. First, his unashamed envy of the American sports model with its closed shop, its sprawling and splurging fixture list, its fluff and razzmatazz. “How do we make each match an event?” he asked. Well, traditionally you sell some tickets, turn on the floodlights and start the game with a whistle. But maybe we’re just not thinking outside the box enough. The other theme was an utter disdain for the idea that underpinned the resistance to the Super League: that football fans themselves might want a say in the running of their game. “Barcelona,” Khelaifi scoffed to the BBC. “A fan-owned club with a €1.5bn debt. Does that work?” And it was here, between the lines of well-rehearsed corporate babble, that the true purpose of Uefa’s power grab resides. They weren’t opposed to the Super League on principle. They were just annoyed it wasn’t theirs. The real tragedy of all this is that none of it needed to happen. For the first time in decades, the big clubs were not operating from a position of strength. Public and governmental anger at the breakaway was at its height. If ever there was a moment to reform the financial model of European football, to break the stranglehold of its biggest clubs, this was it. Instead, they have been rewarded for their sedition by getting virtually everything they wanted in the first place: a virtuous circle of perpetual growth and guaranteed windfalls. Indeed, this is largely why the Ricketts family and others are clambering over each other for a slice of the action. No pitfalls, no jeopardy, no checks and balances: just a licence to print money for eternity. You will not see any protests about this. Fans will not take to the streets in their thousands. Boris Johnson will not be addressing this in Parliament. This is why incremental change – a game being eaten away by a thousand tweaks and reforms – is so much harder to fight. For the most part, people barely even notice it happening.",Sport/Football,The European Super League has returned – Uefa is just calling it something else | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/05/the-european-super-league-has-returned-uefa-are-just-calling-it-something-else
4/5/2022,"At her shop in Accra’s sprawling Kantamanto market – one of the largest for second-hand clothes in west Africa – Cynthia Bentum sits on top of a mound of goods imported from Guangzhou and Manchester. Many who trawl through her clothes are traders themselves and pay via their mobile phones, so the decision by Ghana’s government this week to tax all electronic payments has left Bentum, 49, frustrated. “The main mode of payment is MoMo,” she says, referring to the mobile money service by MTN, the largest provider in the country. “Why board vehicles to come and pay when mobile money payment makes it easier? “I’m not against taxes but I think this particular tax is unnecessary. First of all, look at the cost involved in importing goods into the country. The freight charges are outrageous. Now they want us to pay an e-levy – for what? This is going to affect me seriously and I may end up losing customers, which will eventually affect my business.” Many in Ghana feel similarly bitter. Kofi Brobbey sells spare parts from his store nearby. After being robbed he began using mobile money more often, especially to buy fuel. “I don’t want to pay with MoMo any more because I’m going to be taxed on top of the price for the fuel. Does this make sense at all? Where is the digitalisation they promised us? We’ve been deceived, and now the reality is dawning on us.” An e-levy adding 1.5% tax on all electronic and merchant payments, bank transfers and inward remittances of more than 100 cedis (£10) passed in Ghana’s parliament on 29 March, and will come into effect in May. It has sparked widespread anger about the impact on people’s incomes, and warnings it could reduce the use of mobile payments, which are hugely popular in Ghana. The government said the levy will help raise 6.9bn cedis (£700m) this year, a small dent in the country’s £39bn public debt, but enough to avert the need for a loan from the International Monetary Fund, according to analysts. Yet the tax has been widely unpopular, coming at a trying time for millions of people and focusing growing criticism of President Nana Akufo-Addo’s government. Ghana’s economy, often lauded by officials as one of the most thriving in Africa, has faced big challenges in recent years, in part caused by the impact of the pandemic. Inflation reached 15.7% in February, the highest since 2016, fuelling a cost of living crisis. Ghana’s currency has depreciated by 20% over the past year. In a state of the nation address on Wednesday, the president acknowledged the challenges. “The Ghanaian people are anxious about the economy, the cost of living, income levels … We are aware that we are in difficult times, and we are addressing the situation.” The government has said the policy will widen the tax base in Ghana to include the informal sector, where around 85% of Ghanaians are employed. But it has been roundly condemned by the opposition, trade groups and civil society, who say it will hit Ghanaians already struggling, and risks reversing the trend towards digital transfers. Ghana’s government has heavily promoted mobile and digital payments, spurring a fast-growing industry. Financial technology firms and startups have attracted millions of dollars in funding. Some commentators have expressed concern the e-levy could dent the sector. Mobile phone payments have become ubiquitous in a country where only 42% of people have a bank account. The Covid pandemic has only entrenched its importance. In 2020, the total value of transactions by mobile was more than 500bn cedis (£50bn), and more than doubled the following year. Mavis Bampoe, 51, founded the Vision Montessori school in Accra 10 years ago. “Before coronavirus, I used to have parents queueing at the cashier’s cubicle to pay school fees,” she says. “Then parents transitioned to making mobile payments that were faster and more convenient”. But they have already begun reverting to cash payments in recent months, she says, since it became clear that the e-levy was coming. “If a parent wants to pay fees, they must first transfer money from their bank account to their mobile money wallet. That attracts a charge from the telecoms companies, plus another 1.5% of the e-levy. “After the money has been transferred into their wallet, that parent will now have to send it into my school’s wallet, and that is going to attract another telecoms charge, plus the 1.5% e-levy.” Franklin Cudjoe, director of Imani Africa, a policy thinktank, says people in the country understand the challenging economic times but the policy still feels unacceptable. “It’s just difficult for people to understand why it’s being introduced now. Then also the rate itself is too high. It should have been closer to 0.5%.”",News/Global development,"High-tech, higher tax: Ghanaians face punishing new levy on electronic payments",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/05/high-tech-higher-tax-ghanaians-face-punishing-new-levy-on-electronic-payments

The bureau on Tuesday afternoon warned NSW could be hit by severe weather in the coming days, with coastal regions and adjacent slopes from the Hunter down to the south coast expected to be the hardest hit. Areas still recovering from recent flooding could also be impacted, including the north of the state. The NSW State Emergency Service was monitoring developments in the northern rivers. Sydney can expect large amounts of rainfall, with parts of the city again at risk of flash flooding.

So I’d remind the communities to stay safe [and] up to date with local information.” There will be minor to moderate flood warnings expected for the upper Hunter, the Hawksbury Nepean River, the Colo River, and large swathes of the south coast including the Illawarra region, she said. Dean Storey, assistant commissioner of the NSW SES, said the service was monitoring the situation and “deploying additional assets” to high-risk areas. He asked people to get prepared, be aware of any risks in their area and stay up to date via the weather bureau and SES websites, and local ABC radio. “If you’re impacted by the storm or flood events, know what you would do and where you would go if you need to evacuate your home quickly,” he said. “As noted, roads may be flooded and damaged already.” Storey said some communities could be cut off by flooded roads. “Plan your trips accordingly, avoid unnecessary travel and never drive through flood waters,” he said. “Time and again, SES and other emergency services need to respond to people who’ve made poor safety decisions by choosing the drive through floodwaters.”",News/Australia news,NSW braces for more wild weather and flash flooding as coastal trough develops,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/05/nsw-braces-for-more-wild-weather-and-flash-flooding-as-coastal-trough-develops
4/5/2022,"Scott Morrison’s captain’s picks for 13 New South Wales seats in the upcoming federal election have been confirmed as valid clearing the way for him to go to the governor general and call an election. The NSW court of appeal, comprised of three senior NSW judges, declined to overturn the preselections ruling that there was no “right” arising out of the electoral laws that could be enforced in the courts, and that in any event, the constitutions of the federal Liberal party gave its executive very broad powers to intervene. Although the unsuccessful plaintiff, Matthew Camenzuli, who is a member of the NSW state executive, can appeal to the high court, time is running out. The election is expected to be called this weekend and nominations close 10 days after the writs for the election are issued. Camenzuli has not yet indicated his intention. He would need to make an urgent application for leave to appeal to the high court in the next day or so. The decision means that the political careers of two ministers, Sussan Ley and Alex Hawke as the candidates for Farrer and Mitchell, are likely to continue. Both are running in safe seats. Trent Zimmerman has been confirmed as the Liberal candidate for North Sydney, where he is facing a challenge from independent Kylea Tink and from Labor candidate Catherine Renshaw. Once a safe seat, Zimmerman now faces a challenge to hang on. Lawyer Jenny Ware will run in the winnable seat of Hughes, where she is up against two independents and the former member, Craig Kelly, who defected to the United Australia party. In Warringah, another lawyer, Katherine Deves, who has campaigned against transgender women being included in women’s sport, will run against independent Zali Steggall. The NSW court of appeal case challenged the actions of a three-person committee appointed by the federal Liberal party which included Morrison. The committee intervened in March after factional brawling within the NSW Liberal party had stalled the usual preselection processes, leaving the party without candidates in several important seats. The committee briefly took over the troubled NSW branch and bypassed rank and file preselections to confirm the three MPs to run again. A second intervention by the federal party last weekend to select and endorse a further nine candidates is likely valid too as a result of the court ruling. The court of appeal confirmed earlier precedent that the courts were reluctant to intervene in so-called “club cases” involving disputes over the rules of voluntary unincorporated associations unless there are proprietary or contractual rights at stake. The internal rules of the Liberal party over preselection were “non-justiciable”, it said. Any right under the electoral laws, which use the term “endorsed candidate” only arose later when the registered officer of the party conveyed the names of endorsed candidates to the Australian Electoral Commission, Justice John Basten said when he handed down the judgement. The court explicitly rejected the arguments that political parties had changed in their character since the high court ruled on the matter in 1934. “There was, in 1934, and still is, no provision in the Electoral Act requiring that rules be registered with the commissioner, nor that changes in rules be notified to the commissioner,” the court said. “There is, therefore, no general regulation of the rules of political parties which might warrant the court intervening whenever a dispute arises with respect to the operation of those rules.” Basten also ruled, “in the interests of finality,” that the constitution of the federal Liberal party gave it a broad power to intervene in the affairs of the divisions. The federal constitution gave the party power to take over when there is “the existence of circumstances that, in the opinion of the federal executive, substantially prejudice the ability of the party to effectively contest or win a federal election”.

While the judges agreed this had the effect of overriding the NSW constitution, which says candidates should be chosen by branch plebiscite, it said this was an exercise of power that was justified by the federal constitution. The decision may bring an end to the chaos that has stemmed from the factional war in NSW over preselections. But it is likely to leave bitterness among branch members who have fought for a bigger say in preselection processes within the NSW Liberals.",News/Australia news,Court ruling on NSW Liberal preselections will end chaos but leave a bitter taste,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/05/court-ruling-on-nsw-liberal-preselections-will-end-chaos-but-leave-a-bitter-taste
