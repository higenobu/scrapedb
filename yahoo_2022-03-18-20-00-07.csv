3/18/2022,"Chris Cuomo’s bromance with Don Lemon appears to be completely over, taking an especially ugly turn Wednesday when the disgraced anchor threw his former CNN “brother” under the bus in an effort to extract $125 million from the network. Cuomo demanded the nine-figure sum from CNN in an arbitration filing, claiming damages for breach of contract, lost wages, and what he alleged was an assassination of his character following an unceremonious December firing. In the scorched-earth filing, first reported by Deadline, Cuomo and his lawyers devoted an entire section to lashing out at some of his former CNN colleagues. Under the headline “CNN’s Failure to Enforce Policy Against Other Employees,” Cuomo alleged that the network, under the leadership of ousted lovers Jeff Zucker and Allison Gollust, spared certain talent for ethical violations while firing a bazooka at Cuomo’s career for having helped dig up dirt on the women who accused his brother, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, of sexual misconduct. Among the talent Cuomo took aim at was Lemon, with whom he’d famously shared a close relationship—including Hamptons hangouts, Instagram selfies, a joint podcast, and a near-nightly exchange of “I love yous” during their on-air primetime handoffs. “I love you, brother,” Lemon told Cuomo in August shortly before launching into a segment on the sexual-harassment allegations against Chris’ older brother. “I love you, D. Lemon,” Cuomo replied with a smile. But Wednesday’s filing was nowhere near as warm. “As long as CNN’s ratings would not be hurt, Zucker and Gollust were more than willing to overlook major transgressions by CNN personalities such as Don Lemon and Jake Tapper, or even to engage in blatant misconduct themselves,” it alleged. Cuomo specifically cited how, in November 2021, Empire actor Jussie Smollett testified that Lemon personally warned him that Chicago police didn’t believe his false accusations of a hate crime. Lemon’s consulting with the embattled actor constituted a “flagrant breach of journalistic ethics,” Cuomo’s team wrote. “Intervening in the ongoing investigation by texting Smollett was an inexcusable breach of ethics,” the filing argued. “Yet CNN did nothing; Lemon was not disciplined in any way.” Cuomo’s attempt to drag his one-time pal in order to extract a hefty payout from CNN is perhaps the final blow to a very public, affection-laden friendship. The pair’s nightly on-air “handoff” often generated social media chatter as the pair professed their love for each other and shared anecdotes about their vacations—ultimately leading to a 23-episode CNN podcast literally titled The Handoff and hosted by the two self-described “brothers.” While Lemon has yet to publicly comment on his friend’s firing, he notably struck the first blow last month when he argued in a staff meeting after Zucker’s firing that Cuomo should not be paid any severance. “Did you think about what message it sends to the journalists in this company and to the larger public, that someone can be found to break with those journalistic standards and then get paid handsomely for it?” Lemon grilled WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar during the New York chat, Insider reported. “And what is to stop the next person from possibly getting compensated for it, to spread rumors, or what have you to the press?"" Cuomo also took aim at several other former CNN colleagues allegedly breaching company ethics without punishment. His filing cited how The Lead host Jake Tapper privately suggested Republican congressional candidate Sean Parnell run in a “safer” district instead of against incumbent Rep. Conor Lamb (D-PA). Tapper faced no internal inquiry and faced no repercussions for the action, Cuomo lamented of his former workmate. Tapper, too, had taken a swipe at Cuomo, fretting in private that the former anchor effectively destroyed Zucker’s career by threatening the network following his own ouster. “An outside observer might say, ‘Well, it looks like Chris Cuomo succeeded,’” Tapper said in a D.C. staff meeting with Kilar. “He threatened Jeff. Jeff said we don’t negotiate with terrorists. And Chris blew the place up. How do we get past that perception that this is the bad guy winning?” CNN, Lemon, and Tapper did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In the filing, Cuomo additionally referenced CNN chief legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin’s scandal where he was caught masturbating during a Zoom meeting with New Yorker colleagues—an act Cuomo described as “a sordid act of sexual harassment” and one for which Toobin was never forced to issue a public apology. When reached by The Daily Beast on Wednesday, Toobin declined to comment. “CNN allowed employees to retain their jobs for offenses much more egregious than anything CNN alleges Cuomo ever did,” Cuomo whined in his filing. “But because Cuomo was so strongly linked to Gov. Cuomo, whose political standing and corresponding value to CNN had turned dramatically, CNN falsely claimed that Cuomo violated its policies and practices as an excuse to terminate his contract. This is the epitome of hypocrisy, as there was no valid basis for terminating his contract.” Read more at The Daily Beast. Got a tip?

3/18/2022,"I was a runner in my late twenties, but then stopped exercising and lost my love for it. I tried to remain active, but bad eating habits began to sneak up on me, and weight gain followed. I joined a gym in my mid-thirties but had no clear idea as to what routines I should be following. I was working out haphazardly while maintaining an unhealthy diet full of carbs and sugar. The tipping point was the pandemic: as people in New York were told to be confined, I was just steps away from a fridge full of sugary treats. Studies have shown that people either gained or lost weight exponentially during the first year of COVID's stay-at-home phase, and I was certainly part of the former. I've always been comfortable in my own skin, but I have to admit I wasn't happy with the person I was seeing in the mirror. It was getting very difficult to find clothes in my size, and my weight gain also started to negatively affect my health: the soles of my feet were hurting every time I woke up and noticed a thick skin in my soles and acanthosis nigricans around my neck and armpits. I was 37 when I started noticing these changes; I knew it was time to make a change in my health but somehow I was in a state of denial and just carried on going about my life. It wasn't until a Christmas visit to see family in Miami that I realized I had to do something. My 79-year-old mother put her hand on my belly and said ""Promise me you're going to lose weight. I need you to be healthy"". It was at that instant that I had to make my mission to see a specialist. Two weeks later, a weight loss doctor informed me that I weighed a staggering 330 pounds. I was completely dumbfounded. His diagnosis also showed that my weight put me on stage-1 hypertension, with almost half of my body covered in visceral and subcutaneous fat, high cholesterol and triglycerides. When he offered the opportunity to embark on a weight loss journey, my answer was a resounding yes. The first thing I had to do was adjust my nutrition to help my body shed the excess fat. I switched from eating carbs and just focused on a keto-friendly diet and turned that fat into my source of energy. I ate mostly protein, psyllium husk as a source of fiber, vitamin supplements and omega-3. I embarked on 2-hour workout routines that involved mostly low-impact exercises such as spin and yoga (I avoided running at first because I could have compromised my knees and ankles). I eliminated almost 40 pounds in the first month, then 20 the second month, then 27 by June, and so forth. As the months went by I started incorporating other forms of workout like strength training, CrossFit, pilates and HIIT. But of all these routines, running is my absolute favorite. I lost a more than 150 pounds in eight months, reaching my lowest ever weight of 169 pounds. I also lowered my body fat from 50 percent to just 13 percent. I feel amazing, because I feel like I'm expanding my lifespan. On my next visit to Miami, my mother could not believe what she was seeing, and neither did my sister. A hugely positive part of this experience has been becoming part of a community in New York that enjoys running and remaining healthy. I think for many of us in this city, we decided not to take health for granted much less when New York became the epicenter of COVID-19 in the United States. My fiancée has applauded my effort; she was the one who reintroduced me to running, and we are both running NYRR's United NYC Half and the Brooklyn Half together! My next goal is to run the full marathon when I turn 40. I want to be stronger, faster, healthier, and live longer, and to serve as an inspiration to those who want to make a change in their health. Staying healthy, regardless of weight, should be the main goal. A weight-loss initiative is never just about you; it also creates an impact on those who love you. It is not an easy task to embark on, and there will be plenty of times when you feel like you're not making strides, but the most important thing is to reach the goal no matter how long it takes. I remember watching a dietitian saying that to get to a determined destination, you can either walk, take the train, a plane or a car. It doesn't matter how you get there, the most important thing is to reach that goal. Stay on course!

3/18/2022,"History is full of high achievers who claimed to need only a few hours sleep a night – from Leonardo da Vinci to Margaret Thatcher to Elon Musk. Now, research into so-called ‘elite sleepers’ – who fall asleep late and wake up early, yet feel perfectly refreshed – is changing the way we sleep, and offering clues for ways to treat diseases such as dementia. This week, neurologists at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF), reported on 10 years of research sequencing the genomes of ‘familial natural short sleepers’, who represent around 3 per cent of the population. They found they shared genetic mutations which make it possible to sleep less without suffering any negative health consequences. Such discoveries show that our biological make-up plays a key role in determining how long we need to sleep for. While public health guidelines have traditionally recommended eight hours of sleep per night, some of us may need much more or less in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Russell Foster, professor of circadian neuroscience at the University of Oxford, likes to compare individual sleep patterns to shoe size. “There’s huge variation,” he says. “I think that the myth of the eight hours has actually caused quite a bit of anxiety. In fact, the range for humans can typically go from six hours to ten hours.” Elite sleepers are right at the shortest end of this range and, intriguingly, UCSF neurologists found that their sleeping pattern also came with a number of common personality characteristics. While too little sleep can cause most of us to experience irritable mood and poor cognitive functioning, such as bad memory recall, elite sleepers appear to be the exact opposite. The elite sleeper will typically go to bed between 11pm and midnight, and wake up five or six hours later without needing an alarm. Despite sleeping little at night, they will not feel tired during the day or in need of caffeine. Around 90-95 per cent of the elite sleepers studied have what psychologists would describe as type-A personalities – high on ambition and optimism. Many had exceptional memories, higher pain thresholds than average, and a greater ability to cope with jetlag. The theory could explain how great minds such as Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla and Leonardo da Vinci required meagre amounts of shut-eye. Modern examples might include the designer and director Tom Ford, who can reportedly manage on as little as three hours per night. Donald Trump has claimed to need only four or five, while Elon Musk reportedly sleeps for no longer than six hours, due to the demands of running his companies. However, sleep scientists are keen to point out that elite sleepers represent a tiny fraction of the population. “Making people feel guilty about their sleep, or having this ‘I only got four hours of sleep last night, how brilliant am I?’ approach, is almost tantamount to irresponsible because we’re all so very different,” says Foster. “The consequences could be really bad.” Albert Einstein, he points out, reportedly slept for at least 10 hours a night. He says that a healthier way of assessing our own sleep patterns and whether we need more sleep is to look at how long you sleep for without an alarm clock, whether you struggle to wake up in the morning, and if you tend to crave caffeinated drinks or a mid-afternoon nap during the day. A large body of evidence shows getting sufficient sleep is vital for health, and that too little can impair our memory and make people more prone to all kinds of chronic diseases in mid- to late-life, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and metabolic problems. A study of UK civil servants, known as Whitehall II, has made an association between too little sleep and risk of dementia in later life, possibly because of a slow build-up of toxins. Foster says that scientists have found that even one night of no sleep increases the deposition of a protein called beta amyloid, which is implicated in Alzheimer’s disease, by one or two per cent. “If you get less than seven hours of sleep per night, even in your 50s and 60s, you have an increased risk of developing dementia in your late 70s,” says Tara Spires-Jones, a professor at the UK Dementia Research Institute at the University of Edinburgh. However, the unique quirks of elite sleepers may be able to help us with this. One of the most fascinating facets of their biology is that while they sleep for fewer hours, their gene mutations also seem to protect them against cognitive decline in later life. Essentially, they seem to be able to pack in all the recuperation and cleansing that the brain and body need to stay healthy, in less time – in other words, their sleep is high quality and low quantity. Scientists believe the elite sleeper genes provide resilience against the onset of cognitive decline, and untangling the biology behind them could provide new leads for developing future dementia treatments. “This is an important avenue for future studies,” says Rosa Sancho, head of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, “but most of us won’t have one of these efficient sleep genes.” You typically go to bed between 11pm and midnight and wake up five or six hours later without needing an alarm You never feel tired during the day and in need of caffeine, despite sleeping little at night You have always been very outgoing, ambitious, optimistic and determined, since childhood You are very rarely affected by jetlag You are good at multi-tasking and have a high pain threshold",Health/The Telegraph,What 'elite sleepers' can tell us all about the eight hour myth,https://news.yahoo.com/elite-sleepers-tell-us-eight-170639911.html
3/18/2022,"If you're looking to build muscle, the question of when to eat protein around a workout (before? after? during?) becomes an important one, especially because it seems like everyone has their own routine. You might see some people shaking up a protein drink between reps at the gym or munching on a bar right before or after their workouts. Protein is essential if you're trying to build muscle, but when should you consume it to maximize your gains? Whether to have protein before or after a workout comes down to two factors: muscle breakdown and possible stomach upset, according to registered dietitian Michele Fumagalli. You want to prevent both of them for different reasons. While some muscle breakdown is necessary to get stronger (more on that below), the goal is to ensure that your body has the nutrients to build those fibers back. On the gastrointestinal side, it's important to remember that protein is a more complex macronutrient and therefore more difficult to digest. It can cause stomach discomfort if eaten too soon before your workout. But before we get into the details, let's start with some basics. People associate protein with muscle building because of what happens when you don't eat it, Fumagalli explains. The way you build muscle is actually by breaking it down, creating tiny tears in the tissue (which happens during your workout), then rebuilding it bigger and stronger. But that's only possible if you give your muscles the nutrients they need to grow. Protein is the compound that does that best because your body breaks it down into amino acids, compounds that repair your muscle tissue. When your body doesn't have protein available, the muscle tissue can't rebuild and may start to break down or atrophy. Related: 22 Best Ab-Strengthening Exercises Using Weights That brings us to the timing question. You can get pretty deep into the details of when and what exactly to eat before a workout, but here's a good rule of thumb: the closer you get to your workout, the more you should stick with foods that are easily digestible. ""Two-and-a-half to three hours before a workout is kind of when you want to have your last meal,"" Fumagalli says - a full meal with carbs, protein, and fat. About an hour out from a workout, if you're hungry, she says you should stick with carbs and a small amount of protein, like a granola bar or a banana with a tablespoon of peanut butter. If you're hungry right before the workout - say, half an hour out or less before you want to start exercising - you should stick with straight carbs. Fumagalli suggests applesauce: sweet and easy to digest. Why not load up on protein right before a workout? It has less to do with muscle gains and more to do with workout discomfort. Protein is harder to digest than carbs, so your body sends blood to your stomach to help break it down. But when you exercise, that blood gets diverted to your muscles ""because those are what we're exhausting and we're using,"" Fumagalli says. Having heavy, protein- and fat-rich foods in your stomach when the blood gets called away can cause stomach upset, making for an uncomfortable and often underperformed workout, which can hurt your muscle gains. As for protein after your workout, Fumagalli says that's essential for preventing muscle breakdown, especially if you haven't eaten for over three hours beforehand (and even if you're not hungry). Throw in some carbs, too, to replenish your supply of glycogen (stored glucose, which your body gets from carbs) that got used up during the workout. But, Fumagalli adds, the post-workout protein isn't as necessary if you ate more recently. ""If you had a premeal maybe two hours, two-and-a-half hours prior, your body's using that protein and the carbohydrate that you ate to fuel yourself during the workout and recover afterward,"" she says. In other words, the protein and carbs you eat afterward will supplement that process but aren't quite as crucial as they would be if you'd done a fasted workout. In the latter case, it's more important to eat something in order to prevent muscle breakdown. A 2003 study showed that both muscle synthesis and muscle breakdown spike an hour and a half after a workout, meaning that your muscles are primed for growth but can also go the opposite way without proper refueling. Related: After Doing the 12-3-30 Treadmill Workout For 2 Weeks, I Was Shocked My Glutes Felt This Strong The main takeaway: you're good to eat protein before a workout as long as it's far enough in advance to avoid gastrointestinal stress. Aim for an hour out, at the latest. The post-workout protein will be more crucial, particularly if you do a fasted workout (not eating for three or more hours before, or working out first thing in the morning without breakfast). Whatever you do, remember that these are just two snacks out of a full day of eating, Fumagalli says. Eating a healthy balance of carbs, protein, and fat throughout the day, not just around a workout, will also boost your muscle gain and keep you healthy and energized. Wondering what kind of protein is the best? Fumagalli recommends protein shakes if you need a quick, convenient option, but she says natural sources of protein (such as chicken or tofu) are best, if available. Pick the protein and workout timing that work for you to maximize your muscle-building goals.",Health/POPSUGAR,Protein Before a Workout or After?

3/18/2022,"Russia is believed to be sending its generals to the front line of its war in Ukraine in a bid to bolster low morale among troops. According to Western officials, Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine has ""largely stalled on all fronts"", with Russia making ""minimal progress"" and suffering heavy losses. The Russian President is said to be frustrated at the lack of progress, which has seen his troops fail to seize any major cities despite heavy bombardment of them. On Thursday Ukrainian officials claimed a fourth Russian general has been killed during fighting in the city of Mariupol. Watch: Who are the dead Russian military officers and what do their deaths mean? Another Russian general has been killed during fighting in the city of Mariupol, Ukrainian officials have claimed.  ""We think that one of the reasons why a number generals appear to be killed is because things are going badly they have to go closer to the front to guide their troops… to provide more supervision,"" one Western official said.

Answering a question about the role of the Russian Air Force and its vulnerability to Ukrainian countermeasures, he added: ""I think we are seeing a reasonable amounts of evidence of very, very low morale amongst the Russian forces which may well be playing into the ... necessity of senior officers to go to the front."" On Thursday, Ukraine said Major General Oleg Mityaev became the fourth Russian general to be killed in the war in Ukraine. Fellow officers Major Generals Andrei Sukhovetsky, Vitaly Gerasimov and Andrei Kolesnikov have all also been reported dead by Ukrainian officials in separate incidents. Only the first — Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky — has been confirmed by Russia. According to some reports, analysts believe that around 20 generals are leading Russian operations in Ukraine. One source close to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has claimed that a special unit has been set up to hunt senior Russian commanders, but other suggestions are that their presence near the fiercest fighting is to boost faltering morale among troops. As of Thursday morning, Ukraine's State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection (SSSCIP) claimed a total of 14,000 Russian troops had died in the conflict. Russian is continuing its offensive in Ukraine. On Wednesday a theatre in the besieged city of Mariupol, where hundreds of people were sheltering, was hit, while 80% of residential housing in the city is said to have been destroyed. Despite the continuing offensive, British defence intelligence analysts believe Russia is being forced to divert “large numbers” of troops to defend its supply lines. In its latest intelligence briefing, the Ministry of Defence said: ""The Russian invasion of Ukraine has largely stalled on all fronts. ""Russian forces have made minimal progress on land, sea or air in recent days and they continue to suffer heavy losses. ""Ukrainian resistance remains staunch and well-coordinated.
