12/29/2021,"Strictly speaking, my “winter” love story took place in a whole other season. Although it was January, my girlfriend and I were visiting Argentina, at the height of the Austral summer. But we were in the Andes, 4,000 metres above sea level, surrounded by ice and snow. If that doesn’t count as winter, I don’t know what does. At this point in 2003, Jane and I had been travelling for 10 months – the New Guinea Highlands, Easter Island, Angkor Wat … and we had experience-fatigue.  We had made it to Argentina and, for reasons ranging from the aforementioned travellers’ ennui to the peso crisis making Argentina dirt cheap, had decided to climb Mount Aconcagua. At 6,962 metres (almost 23,000ft), this is the highest peak in the Andes (and the western hemisphere). You don’t need any special mountaineering skills to climb it. Nonetheless, it is a very serious mountain and has killed more than 100 climbers. Most people who attempt it train for months beforehand. They bulk up, too, because you burn a lot of calories climbing high peaks. We were pretty fit, although 10 months’ travel meant we had bulked down. I normally weigh 73kg (11st 7lb) but I was 57kg back then. Our wintry tale starts with us at about 3,600 metres, where it was a sunny 17C. All our cold-weather kit had been sent by mule with our guide to Plaza de Mulas (PDM), the base camp, which is at 4,370 metres. We were looking forward to an easy six-hour hike to PDM through tawny desert landscapes that look like the American west. The day dawned bright and clear, but it didn’t stay that way. After a few hours, we were walking into a 100kph wind. Soon, snow was falling and visibility was getting poor. At 5pm, we called a halt and pitched our tent, figuring that the weather would improve and we would walk up the next day in blazing Andean sunshine. But the snow was the start of the worst blizzard in 20 years. So we hunkered down and snuggled up. People ask, “Wasn’t it romantic?” Well, we zipped our sleeping bags together and cuddled for warmth, but this is where any romcom similarities end. We were in a high-altitude tent designed to cope with howling gales, which resembled a cramped 70cm-high orange envelope. The next morning, I unzipped the tent. Complete whiteout. We knew what to do: sit tight. It was annoying because PDM was only 90 minutes’ walk away, but we also knew that the people who die in blizzards are those who leave their tents. So we went back to bed. We played Travel Scrabble – game after game after game. In those long ago, pre-smartphone days, a lot of travelling was waiting around with very little to do. In Indonesian Papua we had waited a fortnight for a flight in a dull little frontier town. Mostly we’d played the card game shithead – sometimes for eight hours straight. These things are not romantic per se. But spending all day, every day with another person with no real diversions and not getting on each other’s nerves is an excellent test of whether you can spend your life with them. Especially when you’re trapped together in less than two cubic metres. By the afternoon of day two, any novelty had been replaced by hunger. We did an inventory. Food-wise, we had milk powder, two onions and a surprisingly comprehensive selection of herbs. We had a gas stove but not enough gas to melt snow. The river was five minutes’ walk away, but in the blizzard this meant remembering a dozen landmarks because visibility was so low and, y’know, death. I survived and Jane made cream of onion soup, our first meal in 30 hours. And so it went. We talked – increasingly about food – and we played Scrabble. The next morning we woke and opened the tent. Another wall of white. We reassured each other it would be fine – we just had to resist the urge to move. And then something terrible happened. Nature was calling – and not a number one. I looked at Jane. “The loo roll went up on the mules,” she said. I squatted behind a pyramid-shaped rock in the howling snow. In the absence of toilet paper, I looked around me … Well, the solution was soft and white: you make snowballs and keep wiping until they come out clean. When I got back into the tent, Jane asked how it was. “Not as bad as you’d think,” I replied. “But still very bad.” I went down to the river again. On my way back a man appeared out of the whiteness. His beard and moustache were rimed in white and he was leading a pair of ice-shellacked mules. He looked like something from a horror film: an Arctic explorer minutes before death. We wished each other luck and he disappeared into the whiteness, leaving me wondering if he had been there at all. Back in the tent, we ate the last of the onion soup. We talked about how you can live without food for weeks, and played Scrabble. We talked about how we would stay in the five-star Hyatt in Mendoza, how we would drink malbec and eat steak and sink into high-thread-count sheets. We talked about deep, perfumed baths, about the future, about buying houses and marriage and children. We talked about everything. By the third evening we had been in the blizzard for 50 hours and eaten two bowls of soup. We were ravenous, although one upside of not eating is not having to use snowballs as toilet paper. Months ago, in the Himalayas, we had learned there’s not much to do in the mountains at night so you sleep for 12 hours. We slept. The next day, I poked my head out of the tent. Still white. “It might be a bit brighter,” I said, more optimistically than I felt. But an hour after that I saw blue sky, the first in three days. We went outside and did a hungry, smelly dance. Two hours later, we were eating beef and beans at PDM. In the end, we never made it to the top. Jane dropped out at 6,000 metres and I got to about 6,700 – which seems incredibly close. But it wasn’t really – at that height, a few dozen steps feels like the battle of Stalingrad and, besides, I could feel altitude sickness coming on. Back at the Hyatt, we bumped into climbers who had been caught in the blizzard much higher than us. There was a lot of frostbite – hands bandaged like mittens. Some of them would lose fingers and toes, which rather put my failure to summit into perspective. That was 18 years ago, and we’re still together and have two lovely daughters. It’s an unromantic test of romance, but if you can spend 65 hours together, unwashed, in a tiny tent playing Scrabble, you’re in it for the long haul. Needless to say, the three Rigby women reliably veto my occasional suggestions that we go on a walking holiday in the Andes.",Lifestyle/Life and style,My winter of love: The true test of a relationship?

12/29/2021,"(Disney+) Buckle up: this is going to be a wild ride. Lily James and Sebastian Stan undergo serious transformations in the makeup department to play Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee. The mini-series tells the story of their infamous sex tape – the first-ever viral video – and how it all began with the pair getting married 96 hours after meeting in 1995. But beyond dining out on a juicy scandal, will it use a post-#MeToo approach? Hollie Richardson  (BBC Two) Adapted from Adam Kay’s wildly successful and hilarious book of the same name (which was scribbled down in diary form during breaks), this series follows the travails of a junior doctor in the NHS. It has been in the pipeline for some time and was delayed, ironically, by the pandemic which has, to say the least, sharpened our appreciation for our overworked, undervalued medical professionals. Ben Whishaw stars. Phil Harrison (BBC One) Once again, Martin Freeman gets under the skin of a disappointed (and disappointing) middle-aged man and renders him sympathetic. This time, Freeman is Chris, a police urgent response officer whose bleak, solitary night-shifts in Liverpool are disrupted by the arrival of rookie partner Rachel (Adelayo Adedayo). When Chris makes a rash decision, their previously mundane job becomes distinctly more dangerous. PH (BBC) Donald Glover’s eccentric and inventive take on the Black American experience has felt like one of the most timely shows of recent years. As we left him, Glover’s normally diffident hip-hop impresario Earn had just done the dirtiest of the dirty on his protege Clark County and earned the respect of Alfred in the process. Even so, the incident will surely hang over their relationship. Expect season three to be a fraught examination of loyalty and betrayal. PH (Channel 4) The “wee lesbian” (Nicola Coughlan), the “English fella” (Dylan Llewellyn) and the rest of the motley crew are back for a third and final season. For a comedy that has fans in stitches throughout, there’s also a lot of heart in how it handles being a teenager during the Troubles in Northern Ireland – so it’s sure to be an emotional farewell. Also look out for Skint, a series about poverty from Derry Girls creator Lisa McGee on the BBC, later this year. HR (ITV) A family drama that has been dubbed “a love letter to Black London” by its creator Abby Ajayi. There are distinct top notes of Succession in the premise: Hugh Quarshie plays super-rich patriarch Stephen Richards who suffers a stroke and, amid slightly cosmetic concern for his wellbeing, his troublesome family’s secrets and rivalries begin to surface as a fortune appears up for grabs. PH (Channel 4) The war in question is, of course, a cyberwar. And this political thriller sounds like the kind of weighty, slightly portentous fare that is director and writer (and seven-time Bafta-winner) Peter Kosminsky’s speciality. He’s assembled a heavyweight cast: Mark Rylance, Simon Pegg, Adrian Lester and newcomer Hannah Khalique-Brown star as the 2024 general election looms and GCHQ finds itself under attack. But who are the nation’s virtual assailants? PH (BBC Three) This drama has been heralded as the next Fleabag, given that it, too, started out as a one-woman stage show with a flair for the funnies and emotional heft. Creator Nicôle Lecky stars as Sasha Clayton – a 25-year-old wannabe singer and rapper whose attempts to fend for herself become ever more desperate after she is evicted by her family. Alexi Duggins (BBC) In Mum and Him and Her, Stefan Golaszewski created two of the most beautifully observed, touchingly comic portraits of relationships to ever grace the small screen. This forthcoming four-parter about a 30-year marriage, with Nicola Walker and Sean Bean in the lead roles, is sure to do more of the same. Expect dialogue that can shift from hilariously banal to heart-rendingly poignant in the space of a sentence. AD (HBO/Sky Atlantic) If there were ever a video game crying out for a TV adaptation, it’s the poignant 2013 action-adventure epic about a smuggler trying to guide a teenage girl across postapocalyptic America. HBO has chosen it as its first adaptation of a console franchise, so no doubt it’ll reproduce the game’s narrative forte: tempering the bleakness of a zombie apocalypse with the emotional core of a pseudo parent-child relationship. AD (Channel 4) Candice Carty-Williams’s bestselling 2019 novel tells the story of a 25-year-old Black journalist in London whose life starts to unravel when she takes a break from her long-term boyfriend. What follows is a nuanced, authentic exploration of race, mental health, womanhood and everything in between (including a few laughs). With Carty-Williams working on the adaptation, it’s bound to please fans of the book. HR (Netflix) The Drake-backed Netflix reincarnation saw this already great drama about London’s drug gangs scale new heights of brilliance, as its longer episode count let narratives breathe and showcased the killer acting chops of MCs including Dave and Little Simz. The prospect of its return is hugely tantalising – not least due to the narrative drawing the rival gangs of Dushane (Ashley Walters) and Sully (Kano) together with their intensely likable young rival, Jamie (Micheal Ward). AD (Sky Atlantic) Following a final season so disappointing that many fans avoid talking about it, there’s trepidation about HBO’s Game of Thrones prequel. Then again, perhaps the only way is up. It rewinds 200 years to chronicle dragon-loving House Targaryen, with Matt Smith wearing a white wig as Prince Daemon and Emma D’Arcy playing Princess Rhaenyra. Expect the usual low-key stuff: mythical beasts, big budget battle scenes and endless raunch. HR (BBC One) The BBC’s Brum-based gangster drama has failed to put a foot wrong over five hooky, violent seasons. Here’s hoping this final series brings things to a brilliant close, as Tommy continues to battle Oswald Mosley and the second world war looms. It remains to be seen how the show will cope with the tragic loss of Helen McCrory, but at least it can count Stephen Graham as a new cast addition. AD (Sky Atlantic) The most hyped teen drama in years (and rightly so) got us talking with its copious nudity and substance abuse – not to mention the musical number that formed its final moments. But it was also capable of real beauty and depth, not least Zendaya’s vulnerable portrayal of Rue, a young woman struggling with addiction. It earned her a best actress Emmy, and we’re excited to see what new heights she scales as she grows into the role. AD (BBC One and Netflix) From Steven Moffat (Dracula, Sherlock, Doctor Who), here’s a curious thriller following a prisoner on death row in the US, a vicar in a quiet English town and a maths teacher trapped in a cellar – and how they cross paths in a most strange way. With Stanley Tucci, Lydia West and David Tennant heading the cast, it seems impossible to disappoint. HR (Apple TV+) This new series from the Oscar-winning directors of The Lego Movie is part murder-mystery, part comedy, centring on a death at a high school reunion. As the investigation unfolds, each episode will be told from a different character’s perspective, which should showcase the brilliant comic character acting of Jamie Demetriou, Veep’s Sam Richardson and Parks and Recreation star Ben Schwartz. AD (Paramount+) Hey baby, I hear the blues are calling. Following an almost 20-year hiatus, Kelsey Grammer is back as Seattle’s snooty but beloved radio psychiatrist for tossed salads, scrambled eggs and a reboot fans are torn over. Part of the show’s enduring appeal was the relationship Frasier had with his dad Marty – but actor John Mahoney died in 2018. Can the show be as good without him? It’s not clear whether Niles, Daphne and Roz will come calling again, but we hope they’ll return to provide the show with a shot in the arm. HR (BBC One) There’s not one millennial woman in London who has not read – or at least heard of – Dolly Alderton’s bestselling memoir about friendship and romance. In this dramatised adaptation, Maggie and Birdy (played by Emma Appleton and Bel Powley) are two pals in their 20s navigating their first phase of adulthood in a flatshare. But then the unthinkable happens – dependable Birdy gets a steady boyfriend. Just like the book, let’s hope the series is a brave yet vulnerable (and very funny) unpicking of what love means in all its forms. HR (Disney+) Advance photos of this series don’t exactly inspire confidence – the fictional Sex Pistols look more like Ed Sheeran roadies than punk rock tabloid folk devils. But Danny Boyle is at the helm of this dramatisation of Steve Jones’s memoir Lonely Boy and he can normally be relied upon to come up with the goods. The story itself – friendship, music, rivalry, drugs and death – has all the right ingredients. PH (BBC) The remarkable true story of disability rights activists Barbara Lisicki and Alan Holdsworth is brought to life by Bafta-winning writer Jack Thorne. Lisicki (Ruth Madeley) met Holdsworth (Arthur Hughes) at a cabaret night in 1989 – cue years of righteous mischief-making as the couple became the driving force behind the Direct Action Network, whose protests led to rapid advances. PH (Netflix) A changing of the guard for the fifth season of Peter Morgan’s epic. Olivia Colman’s Queen Elizabeth II will vanish into a royal phone box and emerge as Imelda Staunton. More intriguingly, how will Jonny Lee Miller fare as John Major? And what next for Elizabeth Debicki’s troubled Diana, Princess of Wales? No spoilers, but to be honest, we have a bad feeling about where her story arc might be going. PH (Netflix) After 14 years, the extended world of Breaking Bad finally comes to an end as Saul Goodman’s origin story reaches its conclusion. Over recent series, the prequel has come increasingly close to scaling the heights of the original, as Jimmy has moved ever closer to the dark side, so this last outing will no doubt be something to lap up every moment of. It is, after all, the end of an era. AD (Netflix) If there’s one thing TV needs more of, it’s credible adaptations of LGBTQ+ narratives. Hence some of the excitement around this eight-part reworking of Alice Oseman’s Tumblr-born graphic novel of a gay high school romance. The story of Nick and Charlie, two British teens at a boys’ grammar school who fall in love, also looks set to showcase new and exciting talent, including Yasmin Finney, a Black Manchester-based transgender woman – and TikTok star. AD (Amazon Prime) It’s a big year for fantasy revivals, as JRR Tolkien’s epic world of hobbits, wizards and elves is brought to the small screen with a whopping budget (apparently $1bn in total). Aside from a confirmed September release date, fans only know that the series will take place in the Second Age thousands of years prior to the Lord of the Rings books and The Hobbit. All other details are being kept under wraps, which only makes the wait even more exciting.

12/29/2021,"Up to a point, I can plot my life in clothes shops. M&S and Asda as a kid; New Look and Tammy Girl as a pre-teen, then Topshop, surf shops and our local 60s den for massive corduroy flares – the full complement from my rural hometown’s offering. When I moved for university, I revelled in the terribly exotic (to me) Gap and Zara; during my 20s, London offered the untold riches of Cos, Monki and & Other Stories. After turning 30, that sense of surefire fits slipped away. I was probably too old for Topshop’s cropped-everything, plus I found its owner a bit gross. I felt jaded by Cos’s austere dental hygienist smocks. And the emerging age-appropriate uniform of mid-length floral skirt, nice jumper and heeled boots felt like a millennial update of M&S’s old Classic collection, AKA premature fashion death. Where next?  In case the aforementioned array of pedestrian high-street shops didn’t make it obvious, I haven’t been much of a fashion adventurer since I was a teenager, back when chaos was my style MO. (Mismatched Converse, mismatched knee-length striped socks, skirt that looked like a bin bag.) These days I find clothes shopping demoralising (Zara, with your so-called XL that’s no bigger than a size 12 – I’m looking at you.) I’d attempted vintage shopping but never had the eye for it, nor the patience. My wardrobe was haunted by my sole thrifted purchase: a grey silk 80s jumpsuit with padded shoulders, bought in Berlin on the encouragement of a friend who can actually carry off that sort of thing. What felt exciting in the changing room made me feel like a blousy mechanic back home. On the coathanger it stayed. Conscious of the climate crisis and the ills of fast fashion, I wanted to try secondhand marketplaces such as Depop. But when I first poked around, I only seemed to find an avalanche of fleeces – the kind I would wear after a swimming lesson in 1998 – albeit customised and cropped. I don’t have the appetite to rehash that look, nor the abs for its reinvention. Another dead end. Then earlier this year, I was researching an interview with the 21-year-old British pop star Holly Humberstone. Like many of her generation, she loves thrifting, for the creativity and environmental positives. At her shows, she runs a clothing swap initiative where fans might even snare one of her old outfits. Inspired (not to mention sensing an opportunity to procrastinate) I redownloaded Depop. I don’t know whether the site’s range had expanded or my mindset had just shifted: the potential and fun to be had was suddenly obvious. I saw a colleague wearing cool white trousers and wondered if I could find something similar: still with their tags, in my size, half the price of new? Sold, to the woman certain she’ll get jam on them in weeks. My pre-pandemic jeans were skinnies I never want to see again; I researched fits for generous bottoms and learned that a fancy Swedish brand I would never ordinarily splash out on was apparently the answer. And here they were, in my size, perfect condition: £15. (Turns out they were right about the bum thing.) There’s a degree of slot machine-style pleasure in finding exactly what you’re after. Beloved M&S polo neck, rubbed threadbare, in a new colour? Jackpot. This rash of sartorial success encouraged me to commit to not buying new if I can help it (I’m making an exception for pants, pyjamas and gym clothes). As well as making a tiny contribution to the planet, to my delight, it’s also unlocked a desire for self-expression that’s lain dormant since those odd striped-sock days. Walking into a shop and being confronted by outfits you’d never dream of wearing deters me, at least, from burrowing for hidden gems. (The & Other Stories near work currently has a display that I would describe as “cyberpunk Sloane Ranger”, and more power to you if you can pull that off.) Plus taking risks on new wildcard items is prohibitively expensive and potentially wasteful. But on Depop or eBay, dabbling in a new personality comes with less pressure. Cherry-pink velvet hot pants for £8? I could be that person – and if I’m not, I can sell them to someone who might be. I started selling my own neglected items, thrilling quietly at the idea that they were apparently desirable: maybe I had some covetable style after all. I even sold that German jumpsuit. Its new owner – a vintage fiend – told me they love how it hangs and the uniqueness of the detailing; that they would wear it anywhere, “dressed up or down”. It makes me strangely happy that this item I could never love turned out to be just what someone else was looking for.

12/29/2021,"Tis the season to be disturbing hibernating butterflies, and the naturalist Lucy Hodson recently posted a video of a memorable encounter with a peacock. The butterfly was beneath a log and, its sleep interrupted, flashed its wings bearing vivid blue and maroon eyespots. Most strikingly, it also emitted a series of loud hisses that viewers judged like the rustling of petticoats or a whispered “pissaff”.  It may have been a fairy casting a spell but it was also a classic example of deimatic behaviour, a sudden bluff from a defenceless animal to momentarily unsettle a predator. The peacock was also pictured upside down, which is exactly how most predators, from mice to birds, see it. From this angle, the blue eyespots on its hindwings combine with its beak-like abdomen to create a startling image of an owl’s face – from which a wood mouse would flee in terror. Studies have found that a peacock’s hissing increases the likelihood of seeing off a mouse. Enduring a British winter as an adult butterfly is a tough road that only five native species take (most hibernate as caterpillars). The wings that litter log-piles and sheds in spring are testimony to the peacocks whose smart defences aren’t quite bewitching enough.",News/Environment,Specieswatch: the bluffing peacock butterfly,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/29/specieswatch-the-bluffing-peacock-butterfly

12/29/2021,"The children’s social care system in England is unfit for purpose and often puts vulnerable teenagers in greater danger, according to the former children’s commissioner. Anne Longfield now runs the Commission on Young Lives, which warns in a report that the children’s social care system is “handing over” some vulnerable teenagers to criminals and abusers by moving them “out of area” to live in dangerous unregulated accommodation that is sometimes targeted by criminals.  In London, where there is a particular shortage of care places for teenagers, thousands of children in the past year have been placed outside their local borough, according to data from 22 out of 32 London boroughs gathered via freedom of information (FoI) requests. At least 1,516 looked-after children from London spent some or all of their time in placements outside the capital in 2020-21, the data shows. In addition, almost 2,000 looked-after children in London were living in semi-independent accommodation, which is often unregulated, unsuitable and, according to the commission, “a magnet for criminal and sexual exploiters”. These figures are a low estimate and are likely to be much higher across London given some boroughs with the largest numbers of children in care did not respond to the FoI request. Out of Harm’s Way, the first of the commission’s series of reports into teenagers at risk, calls for a ban on the use of unregulated accommodation for under-18s in care; the re-establishment of the government’s defunct serious violence taskforce; a new “teenager in need’ support form; and long-term funding for violence reduction units and young adder (addiction, diversion, disruption, enforcement, recovery) programmes to reduce the numbers of teenagers at risk of exploitation. The report shows how an overreliance on a limited number of residential places where demand significantly outstrips supply, inadequate early identification of those children at risk of exploitation, cuts to funding for early intervention programmes, outdated fostering models, a broken children’s home “market” and the frequent criminalisation of children in the care system is allowing too many children in care to fall into danger. The report argues that a care system that was largely designed for small children is struggling to adapt to the needs of older children, including operating inflexible hours and work practices that are not suited to the often chaotic lives of vulnerable teenagers. The commission’s report also reveals how the care system is failing some black boys. Evidence provided to the commission describes how black boys in care are more likely to go on and enter the youth justice system, and how this problem is worsening as the number of those going into care rises. Black children are already more likely to be in care compared with their share of the under-18 population, while the number of black children in care who were adopted dropped by 50% between 2015 and 2019. Longfield, the commission’s chair, said: “A children’s social care system that is supposed to protect vulnerable teenagers is frequently putting them in even greater danger. Often, we may as well be handing over children directly to ruthless gangs and criminals. It is unfit for purpose. “We know the number of vulnerable teenagers at risk of exploitation entering the care system is becoming older, with more complex and expensive needs, and growing. We also know this is putting an enormous strain on the whole children’s social care system. The recent horrific murders of two young children show the tragic consequence of a child protection system stretched to its absolute limit.”",News/Society,Children’s social care system ‘unfit for purpose’ in England,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/29/children-social-care-system-unfit-purpose-england
12/29/2021,"Tesco is to launch the first fully-electric HGVs to be used commercially in Britain to serve its distribution centre in Wales. Two 37-tonne lorries will transport goods from a rail freight terminal in Cardiff to the company’s hub in Magor, about 30 miles away, from January.  The vehicles can travel about 100 miles on a single charge, making the relatively short distance of the round trip an ideal route to test how further vehicles could be rolled out in the fleet, Britain’s biggest supermarket said. The first two, from the Dutch manufacturer DAF, are expected to make about 65,000 miles of haulage journeys otherwise made by diesel vehicles, cutting an estimated 87.4 tonnes of CO2 emissions a year. HGVs contribute about 16% of all emissions from UK transport, the sector that now contributes most to greenhouse gases. Battery weight and range requirements have made HGVs a more difficult proposition than cars to electrify. Smaller electric lorries have gone on sale in the UK, and 20 are taking part in Department for Transport trials with the NHS and local authorities. The DfT has also commissioned a study into using railway-style overhead electric cables to power HGVs on motorways. Britain became the first country to commit to making all new goods vehicles weighing 26 tonnes and under zero-emission by 2035 at the Cop26 climate summit last month. The largest HGVs will not need to be zero emission until 2040, a decade later than the UK’s target date for phasing out the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. Jason Tarry, the chief executive of Tesco in the UK and Ireland, said starting to convert its distribution network, one of the largest in the UK, would play an important role in the supermarket’s efforts to become net zero by 2035. “We’ve already made progress by starting our switch to electric home delivery vans and rolling out electric vehicles charging points for our customers. I’m excited that Tesco can also lead the way in electric haulage innovation, helping to tackle this last source of road transport emissions.” Its freight partner, FSEW, said it planned to create a low-carbon fuel hub in Cardiff, with more trucks also running on renewable biomethane fuel.",News/Business,Tesco to begin UK’s first commercial use of fully electric HGVs,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/29/tesco-to-begin-uks-first-commercial-use-of-fully-electric-hgvs
12/29/2021,"Health chiefs believed a pandemic was “imminent” in 1997 and drew up a contingency plan that included a mass vaccination programme and closing borders. Officials expected a flu pandemic to emerge from the far east and established a UK-wide plan to deal with the health crisis, newly declassified documents have revealed.  The Northern Ireland Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety received the Contingency Plan for Pandemic Influenza in March 1997, which also included provisions to close schools. The plan reads: “The following conditions coexisting suggest that a pandemic is imminent – the emergence of a new strain of influenza virus which has a marked antigenic shift – a new virus; a high proportion of susceptible people in the population, ie with no immunity to the new virus either from vaccination or from previous infection with a similar virus; evidence that the new virus can spread and cause human disease.” The document continues: “Typically, new shifted strains of influenza virus have emerged in the far east and spread via Asia or the antipodes towards Europe. “If this occurs, some warning is likely before a new strain appears in the United Kingdom, although spread may be very rapid.” It predicted that any flu originating in China would probably have a faster spread than the previous pandemic in 1968 owing to “the opening of China to trade and tourism” and “increasing international movement of people and greater use of rapid methods of transportation”. In response, the then senior medical officer for Northern Ireland, Dr Elizabeth Mitchell, drafted a contingency plan for the region in December 1997 to help the local health service to prepare draft arrangements. The plan says: “Immunisation with appropriately formulated influenza vaccine can reduce the impact of influenza, particularly among those population groups most at risk of serious illness or death. “An early priority of contingency arrangements will therefore be necessary to secure supplies of vaccine against the new strain and to immunise as many people as possible.” The draft report adds: “In general, it is unlikely that the spread of influenza can be halted, but some slowing could possibly be achieved by reducing unnecessary, especially long-distance travel, and by encouraging people suffering from the disease to stay at home. “Closing schools is likely to cause some problems, especially for working parents, but would be an option to be considered, particularly if teacher absenteeism reached levels at which schools could not function.” Mitchell’s report also states that non-urgent hospital admissions, including serious but non-critical operations, would “need to be reviewed and may need to be suspended to make beds available”. A letter from Northern Ireland’s then chief medical officer, Dr Henrietta Campbell, on 17 December 1997 to public health directors and doctors in Northern Ireland raised concerns over an outbreak of avian flu in Hong Kong, which had infected six people.

12/29/2021,"When a glowing Nicole Kidman first glided into shot, speaking in a Russian accent an offensive uncle might pull after a few shandies, it was clear that Nine Perfect Strangers was, actually, not so perfect. But I persevered, because this was another glossy adaptation from Lianne Moriarty – the novelist behind Big Little Lies – and it boasted a cast including Regina Hall, Michael Shannon and Melissa McCarthy. Why might enigmatic Masha (Kidman) have invited this motley crew to her Tranquillum wellness resort? Was there a supernatural twist ahead? Was she evil? Two episodes in, it attempted a big reveal – that she had been slipping guests a daily LSD cocktail – and nobody batted an eyelid because, hey, YOLO. A mindblowing finale was surely due.  But it didn’t come; it was ultimately about a woman chasing hallucinogenic trips to “see” her dead son – and bringing another bereaved family along for the ride. That’s fine, but why was it pretending to be something more sinister or exciting the whole time? Without even knowing it, it was a wellness culture satire, and proof that we’re too easily sucked into wanting to know what happens to silly, wealthy people with non problems. Shame on us. Hollie Richardson The first season of The Morning Show had a giddy allure. A bunch of Very Famous People, some of them doing their best work in years, were let loose on #MeToo and the results were borderline operatic. But then they had to make a second season. The list of everything wrong with The Morning Show this year could fill up the entire internet, so I’ll try to keep to the worst offences. Making Billy Crudup the authority figure, automatically robbing him of all his charm. Setting it at the start of Covid, like a horrible piece of The Newsroom cosplay. The entire Italian episode, which was by far the most baroquely misjudged hour of television made all year. The lack of direction. And the ending. My God, the cack-handed, logic-defying, brain-destroying shocker of an ending. Congratulations, The Morning Show. You were the only series this year that made me physically shout at the TV. Stuart Heritage You is one of the most improbably bizarre dramas ever made, a heady cocktail of stalking, killing and bibliophilia which makes your average daytime soap look plausible by comparison. And yet, for all of those reasons it is also undeniably compelling, with literary snob and murder enthusiast Joe Goldberg (Penn Badgley) hooking viewers in with each sub-American Psycho monologue. If its first two seasons seemed problematic – guy kills girl, repeatedly – season three was a less controversial bingewatch. Both Joe and his wife, Love (Victoria Pedretti), prodded at the fourth wall as they decamped to the California suburbs to do battle with mommy bloggers and tech barons … as well as offing the odd neighbour with an axe. I nearly forgot – they’ve got a baby, too (Joe and Love seemed to forget as well: he wasn’t in it much). From questionable stalker drama to questionable family stalker drama – have you ever heard anything more heartwarming? Hannah J Davies I came of age with the original L Word, when seeing queer women on screen felt so revolutionary – so of course I was going to watch the reboot, Generation Q. The first season was perfectly decent, soapy and trashy in just the right measure, but by series two the shine had worn off. It managed to make the magnificent Bette Porter into a curmudgeonly caricature, much of it involved a court case about marketing opiates that was ill-at-ease with the tone elsewhere, which was a bizarre patchwork of moods in the first place. The rest of the characters seemed stuck on a treadmill of circular stories that had no tension, because they would have been so easily resolved by a single rational action. I understand there’s no drama in that, but a whole season of people doing stupid things for no good reason, in an increasingly confusing mess of plots, isn’t very gripping. So obviously I watched every episode. Rebecca Nicholson What made me go the distance with a multi camera sitcom set in the deeply macho male environs of a Nascar garage? In the dark days of February, maybe all you really want is something low-stakes and easily digestible. The Crew’s plot of a veteran garage chief (Kevin James) butting heads with a fresh-faced new owner (Jillian Mueller) seemed to promise generational and gender-clash shenanigans. But despite an episode where James unexpectedly rocked an eyepatch, this half-hearted Netflix project struggled to get out of first gear. The first 10 instalments were characterised by the mechanical delivery of would-be zingers, unappreciated side characters being put upsettingly through the wringer and two suspiciously out-of-the-blue romantic cliffhangers to wrap the season up. Of course I raced through the whole thing and five months later – when it was quietly cancelled – I hated myself even more. Graeme Virtue As intensely maddening viewing went in 2021, the sitcom writing debut of Love Island narrator and comic Iain Stirling was almost unbeatable. Apparently playing himself, Stirling’s turn as a kids’ TV presenter was so screechy and irksome that his scenes alongside a puppet co-star saw him prove less empathic than a lump of felt with ping-pong balls for eyes. And yet, in a shout-at-the-TV, pray-for-disaster sort of way, it was captivating. It’s not unusual to be hooked on a show by rooting for its lead. But in this case, you were rooting for him to fail. Alexi Duggins For the most part, Behind Her Eyes was a naughtily good psychological thriller – the perfect blend of raunch, wealth, secrets and lies, based on a book by Sarah Pinborough which you can imagine tearing through at the airport. It follows Louise (Simona Brown), a receptionist who starts having an affair with her psychiatrist boss David (Tom Bateman) then befriends his wife Adele (Eve Hewson). Soon, the true story of this outwardly perfect but damaged couple begins to unravel, with Hewson giving a shuddering performance as a woman who is dead behind her eyes. But just when we thought we were going to get a well-considered conclusion, the series decided to switch genres and become a supernatural story about astral projection. Sure, it was a shocking finale which nobody saw coming and we couldn’t stop tweeting about – but that is exactly why it was so damn infuriating. Where was the logic? Why cop out of a decent ending with a nonsensical twist? That said, the closing scene where Adele’s son realised another soul was living in his mum’s body made me want a second season. HR When the UK version of Married at First Sight launched in 2015, I instantly fell head over heels. Despite the gimmicky premise, the show had all the sociological delights of the best reality TV and none of the infuriating cynicism: contestants really seemed in it for the promise of everlasting love, not a career on the influencer circuit. That, unfortunately, was not the case with this year’s edition, revamped to mimic the hugely popular Australian format. Featuring a whopping eight couples, forced to interact regularly during mass dinner parties and communal “commitment ceremonies”, what had once been a genuine social experiment became just another tacky drama factory: performative arguing, fake friendships, game-playing, cross-couple cheating, dinner table showdowns. Still, like previous series, I watched until the end, desperate to know if the participants went the distance – not because I was rooting for them, but because I was concerned for their welfare. Most of these relationships were disturbingly dysfunctional: were they being prolonged solely for the airtime? Going by the eventual slew of separations (and continued tabloid coverage) the answer – mercifully – was yes. Rachel Aroesti The first four seasons of Kim’s Convenience were perfect lockdown viewing: a warm, occasionally biting comedy about a Korean Canadian family and their convenience store. A rare western show to feature a majority Asian cast, it took on immigrant storylines without ever becoming preachy. Until, in the final season, things took a turn, with all emotional investment lost to a string of dead-end storylines. Would the parents close up shop? Would longsuffering daughter Janet (Andrea Bang) land a job? Would eldest son Jung (Simu Liu) get a … better job? (There was some irony here: over the summer Liu starred in Marvel blockbuster Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.) But despite everyone seeming to have given up, I had to know what happened to my lockdown companions. We were eventually rewarded with a series finale, memorable mostly for introducing a break-up within the final five minutes. After it ended, Liu called out a lack of diversity in the writer’s room, turning this hatewatch of a final season into something sadder: a missed opportunity.

12/29/2021,"Midwinter dusk is falling as we navigate the steep maze of arms’-width alleys that pass for streets in Robin Hood’s Bay. It’s the stuff of Instagram dreams, but if you were to go back 250 years, locals had another use for the warren on their doorsteps. Back then, this tiny community was among the busiest smuggling hotspots on the North Sea coast of England. Contraband rowed ashore under the gaze of a clifftop lookout disappeared into a network of passages, interconnected houses and tunnels, including one opening directly on to the slipway. I must have been here a dozen times before my friend Jen told me that it led somewhere, and today we spring the same surprise on our children. They are initially wary. The dark, the rushing water and the smell – not foul, but dank – are not exactly inviting. It’s a bit much for the littlest, but the older two are game, first edging along a shelf on one side, then hopping rock to rock, nimble as ship rats. A short way in, a smaller tunnel opens to one side. It is steeper and rockier than the main culvert, with a beamed and boarded roof that suggests we are under a building. It would be the work of seconds to pass a packet through a lifted board, from where it could be whisked, hand to hand, house to house, to a safe hiding place.  That’s how it happened. It was risky, but the profit on a single parcel of tea or silk or a bladder of Dutch gin exceeded a week’s legally earned wage, and with geology, topography and hydrology on their side, the entire community, as tight-knit as a fisherman’s gansey, was in on it. Rather than being a place built for smuggling, smugglers were made by this place. The tunnel leads out into a steep gully, its sides green with mosses, woodrush and ferns. Above, Christmas lights twinkle in the fog-furled night – close, but somehow a world distant. In the bar of the Bay Hotel later, the kids form a conspiratorial huddle. By the time we leave, the littlest has found her courage, and back to the tunnel they go, together this time, to emerge triumphant, with rebellion running hot in their veins.
