5/14/2022,"Queensland is leading Australia through a cultural and legal transformation to criminalise coercive control, a pattern of behaviours that is highly correlated with the risk of domestic harm and homicide. The state’s premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, announced this week that the government will train frontline responders, including police and emergency services, to be ready for proposed law changes in 2023. The transformation in Queensland policy and legislation has been extraordinarily fast. It is just over two years since Hannah Clarke and her three young children were murdered on a public footpath in a horrific car fire that had been planned and executed by the estranged husband and father of the family. Hannah’s parents, Sue and Lloyd Clarke, this week welcomed the changes that they called for in the Guardian in November 2020. In Britain, the journey to criminalise coercive control took 15 years, from 2000 to 2015 when criminologists, psychologists, researchers and policy makers discovered the strong connection between coercive control and intimate partner homicides. Homicide detectives and criminologists identified a group of behaviours displayed by almost all the killers in the weeks, months and years before every intimate partner murder. Research findings reveal that far from being random or unpredictable, intimate partner homicides are now recognised as the most predictable type of murder and are therefore the most preventable. In 2015, the UK parliament made coercive and controlling behaviours a crime in an effort to protect the lives of victims and their children. The Home Office gave police and prosecutors in Britain a checklist of the specific behaviours that were criminalised to make clear what behaviours were recognised as crimes. The list is not exhaustive but it provides clear guidance about the most common types of behaviour that are harmful and that can lead to a risk of homicide. Most victims are not aware they are being coercively controlled because, especially at first, the behaviour is presented as caring, protective and loving, and often does not include physical injury. The behaviours are all employed strategically by offenders to reduce the victim’s individual freedom, deprive them of basic needs, demean them, surveil their movements and associates, threaten harm and cause actual harm. Coercive behaviours may appear benign to friends and even police, but the victim will understand the subliminal message. For example, Hannah Clarke’s killer indicated he was about to murder her when he wrote a text message a few days before the murders that said: “I’m finishing your game, I don’t want to play anymore.” The exact definition of coercive control in Queensland law is yet to be determined and will need to take into account cultural differences between here and the UK. But the list of behaviours identified by the UK Home Office is: isolating a person from their friends and family; depriving them of their basic needs; monitoring their time; monitoring a person via online communication tools or using spyware; taking control over aspects of their everyday life, such as where they can go, who they can see, what they can wear and when they can sleep; depriving them of access to support services, such as specialist support or medical services; repeatedly putting them down by statements such as telling them they are worthless; enforcing rules and activities that humiliate, degrade or dehumanise the victim; forcing the victim to take part in criminal activity such as shoplifting, neglect or abuse of children to encourage self-blame and prevent disclosure to authorities; financial abuse including control of finances, such as only allowing a person a punitive allowance; threats to hurt or kill; threats to a child; threats to reveal or publish private information (eg threatening to “out” someone); assault; criminal damage (such as destruction of household goods); rape; preventing a person from having access to transport or from working. The dozens of victims of coercive control who I have interviewed in the past two years have been shocked to realise that they were not alone in experiencing the same group of harmful behaviours. Almost all these victims experienced almost all of the above behaviours, indicating they were suffering a very high level of coercion and control. Police action is necessary to protect them from harm. Coercive controlling behaviours are one of eight clearly defined steps preceding intimate partner homicides, as defined by criminologist Prof Jane Monckton-Smith. Monckton-Smith analysed 372 murders and found that very rarely do perpetrators kill their partner in a first relationship. But the perpetrator had often coercively controlled a previous partner and threatened to harm or kill them. Control and coercion in a previous relationship is recognised as stage one of the eight stages leading to intimate partner homicide. Upon leaving the first relationship, the perpetrator begins stage two, forming a new relationship with a predetermined strategy: they initiate a relationship that becomes serious very quickly, demanding a demonstration of commitment and then becoming possessive or jealous. In the third stage, the perpetrator begins exerting control soon after securing the new partner’s commitment. It is in the breakdown of this relationship, stage four, that the perpetrator either lets the partner leave or “changes the project” and decides to kill. Any victim who identifies the first four stages, from the whirlwind beginning of the relationship to the breakdown, needs effective police protection, because up to a third of murders are carried out in a short period of time, from a few hours to a few days of the victim withdrawing commitment or leaving the relationship. Stage five is an escalation of abuse, control or stalking after the relationship ends; stage six is the realisation by the perpetrator that the relationship loss is permanent. If the perpetrator makes a decision to kill, stage seven is the planning and preparation for carrying out a murder attempt. Stage eight is the attempted murder. Victims of coercive control who realise they are victims require medical and psychological care.

5/14/2022,"In 2021, Basjia Almaan, a model, started a fire on Instagram after taking Australian fashion week to task over its incremental approach to diversity in casting. A few years ago, a model unafraid to speak her mind might have faced professional sanctions. This year, it landed her a job as a casting director. In addition to walking several shows, Almaan cast the runway at Iordanes Spyridon Gogos, assembling a roster of models, musicians, dancers and artists that played like the Australian equivalent of a Savage X Fenty show. Backstage after the show, her name was sung with praise, with her Instagram post cited as a challenge to do better. Earlier that day, as Almaan’s hair was being finished off for her appearance on the runway at Sydney label Nicol & Ford, she reflects on what a difference a year can make. “I’ve definitely seen a huge improvement when it comes to diversity,” she says. “It’s definitely taken a minute.” In 2021, Australian fashion week featured – for the first time – two shows devoted to First Nations designers. Those shows returned in 2022, and this year’s presentations also included two notable firsts: a runway show dedicated to adaptive fashion, and the Curve Edit – a showcase of designers offering extended sizes to celebrate the 20th anniversary of size-diverse modelling agency Bella Management. But the casting changes extended well beyond those shows. While there were still plenty of tall, slender bodies on the catwalks, the number of models who were bigger, shorter, or simply more hairy was unprecedented. While some shows featured only a handful of non-traditional models, at others, if you were asked to describe what a model looked like, the only shared adjectives would be “confident”. “I’ve noticed that the casting is a lot more diverse in terms of … body size, in terms of ethnicity, which has been incredible to see,” Almaan says. Backstage at the Curve Edit, Robyn Lawley, an Australian model, also noticed the change. “It’s finally happened! It’s here, it’s here to stay,” she says. “Looking at all the runways this week, they’re going to cement that change. Because diversity, and actually seeing it on the runway looks incredible.” In a tone mimicking the voice of a hypothetical industry insider, she says “they’re like, ‘oh, it does look good. Our clothes do look good.’” Gary Bigeni, a designer, made a return to fashion week on 10 May for the first time in five years. Between a cancer diagnosis and the pandemic, it was not an easy period for the designer, but it was immensely clarifying: he studied youth work and started teaching fashion classes. “We can talk about a lot of things,” he says, “but a lot of those things aren’t put into action … coming back I wanted to do something.” He presented his colourful, hand-painted, genderless clothing on models of many ages, races and sizes – “I wanted it to be something that everyone could approach and buy from.” But the collection represented diversity in a different way too: he was showing a new way of doing business. Abandoning the usual ambitions of growth, Bigeni’s business model is now made-to-order only. He creates a single garment, photographs it, and then only makes that piece again when someone orders it online, allowing him to tailor each garment to a customer’s needs. It’s a completely different way of working from a mass or even small-scale production model, and has reinvigorated his love for his craft. Timothy Hugh Nicol and Katie-Louise Ford of Nicol & Ford are also a mostly made-to-order business. Almaan says the bodysuit she modelled for their show was “probably my favourite look that I’m wearing … because it was made custom to my body”. Custom-made was the order of the day at the Adaptive Edit too. The designers behind Jam the Label and Christina Stephens created each look in collaboration with the model wearing it to suit their individual needs: from side zips and magnetic closures for easier fastening and unfastening, to high-cropped jackets to accommodate wheelchair users. Two of the models who walked for the first time this year at fashion week told Guardian Australia that shopping is frustrating for them due to Australia’s limited sizes. Given the significant captive market brands that do cater to extended sizes now enjoy, it’s easy to imagine the more inclusive sizing showcased by mainstream and independent fashion brands wouldn’t be a welcome development. Not so, says Sophie Henderson-Smart, a designer specialising in size-inclusive swimwear under the label Saint Somebody, who showed at fashion week for the first time. She says that this year marks a turning point, but, “the big difference with mainstream brands using curvy models on the runway is … their sample is still a size eight and they would grade that up.” “Whereas my sample size is a 16, and then I grade down and up from there. The fashion we’re creating is mindfully designed for a curvy body specifically.” Martin James, who runs four size-inclusive evening wear labels and created a beaded, 1920s inspired gown for Lawley, agreed. “Competition makes life healthy … It’s about time brands or companies don’t discriminate on size.” Although she will use the term in certain contexts, Henderson-Smart believes it is time for the industry to abandon the phrase “plus size”. “I’m not a big fan of the words,” she says. “We just need to know sizes in numbers … What size am I? Do they make it? I’m going to buy it.” Bigeni puts it more bluntly: “The language we’re using is all really fucked up.” So what do you call a model if they’re not tall and thin? Almaan proposed a simple solution: actually asking the individuals in question. “I think everyone prefers different things,” she says. Pointing to Mia Dennis as an example: “she’s classified as a curve model, but she’s like, ‘just call me a fat model’.” “I prefer the term,” Dennis says. “I like to use the word fat because it’s a sense of reclamation for me. Being called that all the time as a kid by my family and peers, using that language to describe myself, and for it not to be a derogatory term, is something I find really powerful.” “There’s almost this thing of starting off slow. I think that’s stupid. I think that’s colonial. I think it’s really outdated. We deserve to take up the space, because we’ve been excluded for such a long time.” “The industry needs to stop creating this aspirational aspect of bodies. We should be aspiring to a space where everyone can feel seen.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,‘Enough of this plus!’ A paradigm shift at Australian fashion week,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/may/14/enough-of-this-plus-a-paradigm-shift-at-australian-fashion-week
5/14/2022,"Labor will enter the final week of the election campaign armed with a new $970m investment in primary health and a boost for infrastructure upgrades in GP practices. The policy, unveiled on Saturday and welcomed by the Australian Medical Association as a “strong down payment” in boosting primary health care, includes a $750m “Strengthening Medicare” fund to roll out from 2023-24 and a $220m grants program for upgrades in local GP practices. Labor says the new funding will improve patient access to general practitioners both during and after business hours and provide greater affordability and better management of complex and chronic health conditions, which should relieve pressure on public hospitals. If Anthony Albanese wins on 21 May, Labor will create a taskforce chaired by the minister for health to consult on a new primary health care strategy with all the medical stakeholders, including the Australian Medical Association, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine, the Consumer Health Forum, and the National Aboriginal Controlled Community Health Organisation. GP practices will also be able to apply for grants worth between $25,000 and $50,000 for larger clinics. The funding will go to upgrading IT systems to support telehealth consultations, training for staff, new equipment and upgrades to infection control and ventilation for GP surgeries. The new health initiative comes ahead of the Liberal party’s official campaign launch on Sunday. Labor is expected to release its full policy costings next week. The AMA’s president, Dr Omar Khorshid, welcomed the new funding commitment. “The primary care fund announced today by the ALP, if implemented, is a strong down payment that will help realise the recently completed 10 Year Primary Health Care Plan – a plan which has remained completely unfunded by the government,” Khorshid said in a statement. “The ALP’s primary care fund pledge will allow investment in programs that will improve access to services for patients including GP after hours services and the Workforce Incentive Program,” he said. The shadow health minister, Mark Butler, said average out-of-pocket costs to see a GP have increased by 33% under the Morrison government. “Australian primary care is in crisis,” Butler said. “Our local GPs were at the coalface of the Covid pandemic, providing Covid and vaccination advice, administering vaccines, and trying to keep up with their usual case load with little or no support from the Morrison government. “Our doctors deserve more than thanks. They deserve a government that gives them the resources to deliver the best healthcare outcomes for Australians.” In the middle of April, the AMA met with Anthony Albanese to urge the Labor leader to reconsider his “small target” strategy on health. That meeting followed criticism from the peak medical body about Labor’s $135m urgent care clinic policy. In response to that initiative, Khorshid noted while the urgent care clinics might be popular with the public, they would not make any difference to the pressure on emergency departments. In an interview with Guardian Australia at that time, he added at that time that he would be encouraging Labor to be more “courageous” on the issue of health. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning While Labor is promising almost a billion dollars for primary care, the issue of hospital funding remains unresolved. Earlier this month Albanese said he was prepared to sit down and work “constructively” with state premiers who are campaigning for an increase in the level of hospital funding. But the Labor leader ruled out making any grand funding promises before the election. All state and territory leaders have been pushing the federal government to permanently lift the commonwealth’s funding guarantee to a 50-50 funding split beyond June 2023 when the current arrangement ends. The cost to the commonwealth is estimated at about $5bn extra a year. At the last election, the then Labor leader, Bill Shorten, promised to lift the commonwealth’s share of hospital funding to 50%, but came under fire from the Coalition for its large suite of policy offerings with a scare campaign focused on the “Bill you can’t afford”. The health policy to be unveiled on Saturday is expected to be Labor’s last significant policy in that portfolio before election day.",News/Australia news,Labor promises $970m investment in Medicare and general practice ahead of final week of election,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/14/labor-promises-970m-investment-in-medicare-and-general-practice-ahead-of-final-week-of-election
5/14/2022,"In December 2016, Channel nine’s A Current Affair ran a quintessentially A Current Affair story about a welfare crackdown. After the throw from Tracy Grimshaw, Alan Tudge, then human services minister, appeared on screen with a startling message: “We’ll find you, we’ll track you down and you will have to repay those debts and you may end up in prison.” This was the government pushback to what was becoming known as the “robodebt” scandal, a mammoth Centrelink debt recovery system established by the Coalition government a year earlier. “Whereas we used to have a manual process of checking people’s income records on Centrelink with those on the taxation office’s database, now we have an automated system, so we can do that very quickly, very rapidly and be able to capture more people,” Tudge said. Three years later, after what can only be described as the gaslighting of anyone who complained or raised the alarm, the government admitted to the federal court that the whole thing was unlawful. Putting it very crudely, the calculations that the government used to assert hundreds of thousands of welfare debts were wrong. It later settled a class action for $1.8bn, which included the owed interest on the debts unlawfully issued to 443,000 people, some of whom were the most vulnerable in the country. This included people experiencing mental health challenges, some who were homeless or had disabilities. Many were poor, some desperately so. There were at least three reported suicides among those caught up in the scheme, and a broader mental health toll: the stress, depression and anxiety from those who suddenly owed the government thousands of dollars, who were hounded by private debt collectors, or had had their tax returns garnisheed without warning. For some people on the lowest incomes, such a financial hit changed the course of their lives. The origins of robodebt started before Tudge, in 2015. As a Senate inquiry report released on Friday afternoon said that the “income compliance program”, as it was officially known, was established as an expense measure in the 2015-16 budget and announced by then social services minister, Scott Morrison. The Labor-Greens majority inquiry report called for a royal commission into what the federal court described as “shameful” and a “massive failure of public administration”. Such a failure begs the question: how could the federal government have gotten it so wrong? Did it not get legal advice first? If so, what did it say? Were ministers warned of any risks? Who proposed the scheme? Was it pushed by executives at the then Department of Human Services, which runs Centrelink and ran the crackdown, or by the Department of Social Services, which runs social security policy? Did it come from bureaucrats or were they responding to requests from government ministers who wanted to bolster the budget bottom line? And what was the internal response when appeals tribunals, and then esteemed legal minds started questioning its legality? These are basic questions that we should be able to answer after what is believed to be largest settlement between the Australian government and its citizens in history. Yet two years after the courts stepped in, the public is none the wiser. No ministers lost their jobs. Only last month, in response to a call from Labor for a royal commission, Morrison said the problem had been “addressed”. “There have been numerous inquiries into this and there’s been court matters which we’ve fully cooperated in, and almost $750m in response to that,” he said. His claim there’s no need for a royal commission ignores the fact his government has blocked the inquiries he refers to at every turn. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Senate inquiry said the government refused to provide key documents, such as briefings it received during the scheme’s operation and any legal advice. One or those documents highlighted by the inquiry report is a February 2015 executive minute to the then social services minister, Morrison, which proposed a “new online approach to compliance”. All those documents remain secret, classified as legally privileged or cabinet-in-confidence, with the government saying it is against the public interest to release them. Many will focus on the role of the prime minister in the robodebt scandal. He appears to have been involved near the start, banked (and spruiked) the revenue from further expansions as treasurer (savings that never eventuated of course), and as prime minister oversaw a strategy that stonewalled until the courts said otherwise. And in settling the class action, the government accepted no wrongdoing. More important than blame, though, is an understanding of how this public policy disaster happened. There are failures in the government, but also beyond that. The commonwealth ombudsman failed to check the legality of the scheme when essentially finding its only problems were administrative in 2017. Administrative Appeals Tribunal members made wildly varying findings – some found the scheme was unlawful, others gave the debts the green light. The government oversees big government programs – the NDIS, employment services and the welfare payments system – that are relied on by some of the most vulnerable people in the country. Morrison argued that now the money has been paid back and the program stopped, the matter is “addressed”. But without an understanding of how it occurred, what’s to stop something similar happening again?",News/Australia news,A failure as shameful as robodebt leaves questions only a royal commission can examine,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/14/a-failure-as-shameful-as-robodebt-leaves-questions-only-a-royal-commission-can-examine
5/14/2022,"There was a wide divide exposed between the federal Coalition government and Victoria’s Liberal leadership that many people missed this week. With integrity becoming a key issue in the federal campaign, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, was decrying the prospect of a “kangaroo court” where a premier could be grilled publicly without being accused of corruption. Meanwhile, Victorian Liberals were angered that the premier, Daniel Andrews, was questioned as a witness – with no allegation of wrongdoing against him made – in two private hearings of the state’s corruption watchdog, the Independent Broad-based Anti-Corruption Commission (Ibac). According to reports, the premier was interviewed as part of Ibac’s inquiry into an alleged cash-for-access scandal involving a property developer, local councillors and MPs, and another inquiry into alleged branch stacking in the Victorian Labor party and the misuse of public funds. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Andrews. But it didn’t stop the opposition from trying and failing to pass a motion in parliament – described as a stunt – calling for the Labor leader to stand down. But before the final vote on David Davis’s motion, opposition MPs and members of the crossbench, including the former Labor minister Adem Somyurek – who himself is being investigated by Ibac – accused the premier of lacking integrity. “Why won’t he be upfront with Victorians? Because he has something to hide. Because he is a man who is steeped in deception and disingenuity and quite frankly does not believe in what integrity means to a decent society. I find it absolutely extraordinary,” the Liberal MP Georgie Crozier told parliament. Davis told parliament: “Why can’t he be direct and just say, ‘Look, yes, I’ve been there. There was a matter under investigation, and it was on this date I spent an hour and a half’ – or 2 hours or 4 hours – ‘there under investigation’?” The problem is, Andrews might well be unable to answer any of those questions without committing an offence. According to the laws governing Ibac, witnesses can be issued with confidentiality notices, restricting them from speaking about an investigation. In some cases, witnesses are unable to say whether they are even subject to such a notice. This is done to protect Ibac’s investigations, the safety or reputation of a person or the ability of a person who has been or may be charged with an offence to get a fair trial. But what it also does, as it has in these circumstances, is allow for speculation to run rife. Ibac is also hampered by the high bar it needs to meet to hold public hearings. Currently, the commission may only order a person to appear as a witness in a public hearing if it considers there are exceptional circumstances or when it is in the public interest to do so. The risk of causing unreasonable damage to a person’s reputation, safety or wellbeing also has to be taken into account. This contrasts with Australia’s oldest anti-corruption body – the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac), which can hold public inquiries, compulsory examinations or both. Geoffrey Watson, a former counsel assisting for Icac and now the director of the Centre for Public Integrity, described Ibac as a “poor model”. “Ibac is better than some, and not as good as it could’ve been. The original design was much closer to the NSW model, and Ibac is seriously hampered in its performance by the restrictions on it holding public hearings,” he told Guardian Australia. The Ibac commissioner, Robert Redlich, told a parliamentary inquiry on Monday that public hearings were “still the most effective way of developing trust in institutions that have to investigate and expose corruption”. “I don’t think there’s a doubt that by placing matters in the public domain one is best able to ensure that there is a public and executive government appetite to embrace reforms that are exposed when particular wrongdoing is revealed.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app Earlier this month, the Coalition opposition promised to boost both agencies’ funding, by $10m and $4m a year respectively, in a bid to rebuild a “system of integrity and honesty in government”.

5/14/2022,"New Zealand’s finance minister is one week out from the most important date in his professional calendar – delivering the next budget. And he could be in for a tough sell. The image Grant Robertson carefully cultivates is of a disciplined spender and a fiscal policy nerd, joking that it’s “great to have a bit of public finance in the morning” and claiming that infrastructure deficits keep him up at night. It is an image he needs to maintain in order to weather another unstable year and hold on to the votes Labour hoovered up from traditional rightwing voters in 2020. The budget – due to be delivered on Thursday – will be a key moment for setting the political scene as the country heads towards a 2023 election. “This one is about security,” Robertson says of budget 2022. “It’s about providing New Zealanders with a secure future that is built off of that kind of low emissions, high wage economy.” “Balance”, “reset” and “security” are words Robertson has used frequently in his budget announcements over the past few weeks as he seeks to reassure the public that the economy is in safe hands. In the first pre-budget speech last week, Robertson provided a glimpse of what budget 2022 will entail: big spending on health and the environment, new commitments on borrowing limits and debt targets and a goal to look at long-term spending over short-term cash injections. It is the fourth budget he has put together using the “wellbeing approach”, which includes a broader range of outcomes including health to assess policy success and which first grabbed international headlines in 2019. Robertson admits Covid disrupted the wellbeing budgets of the past two years and they were not “quite how [he] envisioned them”, but now that this budget is “less of a crisis budget”, the government is returning to its original wellbeing framework, he says. It is also third budget to be overshadowed by Covid. But unlike the past two years, where the government was buoyed up by its success in managing the pandemic, and extraordinary popularity, this year the shine is fading and its spending will be scrutinised more intensely as a result. The opposition leader, Christopher Luxon, has regularly accused the government of being “addicted to spending” and alleged that it is driving up inflation. “We don’t need cuts to spending and public services but we do need to make sure that any wasteful spending or any incremental new spending, we’re getting a return from it,” he told RNZ last month. With food prices at a record high, inflation at its highest in three decades, fuel prices topping $3 a litre and eye-watering housing costs, Labour has been paying for it in the polls. Robertson is “not surprised” with the shift in numbers. “After having fought our way through Covid and sacrificed a lot, we’ve now got this global inflation shock. People are tired … and they’re a bit grumpy.” While Jacindamania could perhaps now better be described as Jacinda-meh-nia, Robertson says Jacinda Ardern is still the best person for the job. “Jacinda is still really well respected in New Zealand. She’s a great leader and she’s somebody who I think has got the vision and the wherewithal to lead us.” If there is a moment to steady the ship, it is now. For Robertson, that means investing significantly in the worn-out health system and pumping money into climate change solutions – big-ticket concerns he says he “owes to people”. “If we don’t get on with the job of addressing climate-change issues, our children and our grandchildren will not forgive us for it, and they’d be right not to,” he says. But this year’s budget may not provide the immediate relief many New Zealanders struggling with day-to-day costs are looking for. Robertson is quick to reel off some of the responses the government has already made to the cost-of-living crisis, including increased winter energy payments, an excise on fuel duties, halved public transport fares and benefit boosts. The crisis is “clearly putting significant pressure on households”, he says. “I believe my job as the minister of finance is to deal with the here and now but also look ahead because it’s very hard for individual households to do that,” he says. “We’re not going to lower fuel prices by cutting health spending.” The government is “in between a rock and a hard place for the first time in two years”, with both the Covid response falling away and the cost of living crisis ballooning, says Ben Thomas, a political commentator and former National government staffer. “It is a bit of a global phenomenon and equally tricky for every government everywhere in the world. “They [just brought] down petrol prices by 25 cents, and that reduction has basically been entirely eaten away since it was announced six weeks ago.” The government is back in same position it was, but with more pressure to meet the public’s expectations for a response, Thomas says. “You could probably get anybody to agree [the big ticket items] are important but they don’t do a lot in the short term to fix rising inflation and the rising cost of living.” Still, finance ministers tend to under-promise and over-deliver on budget day, he says. “Robertson – it should never be forgotten – was the architect of Helen Clark’s interest-free student loans policy, which was cobbled together at very short notice and pretty much won them the 2005 election.” Despite some of the discontent indicated in the polls, he remains upbeat, saying: “We’ve got some of the best economic indicators, be it around debt or GDP or how quickly we’re getting back to surplus or unemployment ... It’s challenging and tough times – I’m not pretending it isn’t – but we’re in a better position than most to get through it.”",News/World news,"As the shine comes off NZ Labour, Grant Robertson hopes his budget can steady the ship",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/14/as-the-shine-comes-off-nz-labour-grant-robertson-hopes-his-budget-can-steady-the-ship

One of the greatest misconceptions about the FA Cup over the years is that it has failed to move with the times. In fact, ever since the first final at the Kennington Oval 150 years ago people have been messing around with it, tweaking and tampering and trying new things. It was the first competition to use goal nets and experiment with numbers on shirts; the first to embrace VAR; the first to allow games on a Sunday. Third-place playoffs have come and gone. At its best the FA Cup is not simply a time capsule or historical re-enactment. It can show us who we are and where we’re going. For Jürgen Klopp and his formidable Liverpool team, the FA Cup represents a sort of final frontier, a destination as well as a part of the wider journey. Winning the Cup on its own does not make a side great. Klopp, who has made no secret of his competitive priorities over the years, would doubtless argue that the success of his project does not hinge on winning a single 90-minute game of football in the aftermath of a Pete Tong set. But go back through the history of English football and very few of its great coaches did not conquer the competition at some stage. Brian Clough won league titles and European Cups but to his dying day the absence of a Cup final triumph remained one of his great regrets. If Klopp leaves England without an FA Cup winner’s medal, it will gnaw at him: not a lot but persistently and forever. For the club as a whole Saturday’s game is a chance to reignite what has been a curiously casual relationship with the game’s oldest competition. Quick quiz: without looking it up or trying to count them manually, how many FA Cups have Liverpool won? Virtually every fan will know – instinctively, almost genetically – about the 19 league titles and the six European Cups. But seven FA Cups (one fewer than Tottenham)? It’s not a shameful record by any stretch of the imagination. But nor is it the sort of thing you put on the side of a bus. The classic Liverpool sides made Wembley their garden. Ian Rush remains the record scorer in FA Cup final history. Bill Shankly ranked the 1965 win as his greatest achievement in management, ahead of the league championship a year earlier. The draining 1989 final against Everton, held weeks after the Hillsborough disaster, felt like a small moment of solace for a grieving city. For all this, and for all the Cardiff heroics of Michael Owen in 2001 and Steven Gerrard in 2006, Liverpool have not won the Cup at Wembley for 30 years. There will never be a better time to scratch that itch. By contrast the FA Cup had filtered into Chelsea’s bloodstream long before a Russian oligarch with a five-day beard clapped eyes on them. Those seven wins between 1997 and 2018 – achieved under seven managers – feel somehow pivotal to the mythology of the modern Chelsea, the idea that there is no club in England better at lifting itself for the one-off occasion. This will be their 12th final in the last 26 editions and yet, should Liverpool prevail, they will become the first club ever to lose three in a row. If it feels a touch perverse to question the killer instinct of Thomas Tuchel’s team, one that has won European and world club championships in the past 12 months, then consider, too, that Chelsea have now lost their past five Wembley finals in all competitions, including a bruising penalty shootout defeat by Liverpool in this season’s Carabao Cup. A fifth season without a league title – or indeed, a top-two finish – will be their longest drought since the Ken Bates era. Still under government sanctions, and braced for another summer of disruption and transition, the FA Cup gives Chelsea a chance to anchor themselves in something real, the reassurance that they still are who they say they are. The game itself promises to be a maelstrom. Go back a decade to the last time these clubs met in the final and what strikes you above all is the aura and heft of the two sets of forwards: Didier Drogba and Luis Suárez on the pitch, Fernando Torres and Andy Carroll on the bench. This was still an age when clubs looked upon their strikers as their totems, their talisman, their tone-setter. Drogba scored what would turn out to be the decisive goal in a 2-1 victory. The much-maligned Carroll electrified the game’s later stages, cannoning a header off the crossbar that may – and in those benighted pre-goalline technology days, we would never know for sure – even have crossed the line. This will feel like a different sort of game, a kind of free-form chaos, a swarm of hybrid attacking midfielders making runs from weird angles and trying to bend defences into unsustainable shapes. Two high lines will grapple fiercely for territorial supremacy. Put two defenders on Mo Salah and you simply create room for Sadio Mané to go where he wants. Cling tight to Mason Mount in an attempt to prevent him dictating attacks and you leave a space in behind that Kai Havertz will almost certainly find. Nothing about this will feel staid or conventional or hidebound. Nothing about this will feel second-string or inessential. At times the FA Cup has seemed to be weighed down by its history, too anchored in nostalgia, too obsessed with the idea of some mythical golden age. But 150 years on from the Wanderers and the Royal Engineers, Liverpool and Chelsea will step out under brilliant Wembley skies: two teams defined by their past, playing football from the future, with their gaze fixed firmly and intently on the present.",Sport/Football,Old traditions meet modern convention in FA Cup final of promise | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/13/old-traditions-meet-modern-convention-in-fa-cup-final-of-promise
5/14/2022,"Every week we wrap up the must-reads from our coverage of the Ukraine war, from news and features to analysis, visual guides and opinion. Russian president Vladimir Putin led anniversary celebrations of the Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany on Monday, as Russian forces intensified attacks on Ukraine in one of the deadliest conflicts in Europe since the second world war. Daniel Boffey and Isobel Koshiw reported on anniversary festivities, including a fly-past over the nine domes of St Basil’s Cathedral in Moscow with supersonic fighters, strategic bombers and, for the first time since 2010, the Il-80 “doomsday” command plane, which would carry Russia’s top brass in the event of a nuclear war. The parade came two days after Russian forces bombed a village school in eastern Ukraine, killing 60 people. Putin has repeatedly likened the war in Ukraine to the challenge the Soviet Union faced when Adolf Hitler invaded in 1941. He told Russian soldiers they were “fighting for the same thing their fathers and grandfathers did”, using his Victory Day speech to justify his invasion of Ukraine. Shaun Walker analysed Putin’s list of grievances with the west, and noted that this year the invasion of Ukraine has made his message harder to stomach, even for many of his fans. In an episode of Today in Focus, Moscow correspondent Andrew Roth told Michael Safi that the speech was revealing of Putin’s dilemma – one that could make or break his presidency and his legacy in Russia. If he escalates the conflict, he stands more chance of winning the kind of victory he initially hoped for. But should that fail, he would face humiliation. Alternatively, he could claim victory now and seek to de-escalate the conflict. But would a limited, compromised declaration of victory be regarded as anything but a retreat? Russian bombardment of Ukraine had intensified ahead of the parade, including a direct hit on a school in eastern Ukraine that killed dozens of people, Daniel Boffey and Isobel Koshiw report. After two months sheltering in besieged Mariupol, civilians arrived in Ukraine-held Zaporizhzhia, exhausted and with few possessions, reports Emma Graham-Harrison. The last civilians rescued from the besieged Azovstal steel plant complex in Mariupol reached safety in Ukrainian-held territory late on Sunday. The convoy arrived in the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia after dark, carrying about 170 evacuees. There were 51 civilians who had been sheltering in the Azovstal complex, and about 120 others who had walked or hitched lifts across the city to a pickup point in a ruined shopping mall. The journey of just over 200km (124 miles) took two days, as the convoy of buses was held for hours at Russian checkpoints and the hungry, weary residents inside were interrogated. “I didn’t think we would make it out alive, so I don’t have any plans for my future,” said Natalia, who worked at the Azovstal plant and sheltered for more than two months in its network of bunkers. She had fled with little more than a collection of drawings made by children in their shelter; she had organised drawing competitions to occupy them and kept the pictures to remember. “I wouldn’t have given them up even if they shot me.” When the soldiers of an elite Russian army brigade were told in early April to prepare for a second deployment to Ukraine, fear broke out among the ranks, writes Pjotr Sauer. The unit, stationed in Russia’s far east during peacetime, first entered Ukraine from Belarus when the war started. But after returning to Russia in the wake of the botched initial attack, they refused when they were told they were supposed to go back for another tour at the front. “It soon became clear that not everyone was onboard with it. Many of us simply did not want to go back,” said Dmitri, a member of the unit who asked not to be identified with his real name. “I want to return to my family – and not in a casket.” Along with eight others, Dmitri told his commanders that he refused to rejoin the invasion. “They were furious. But they eventually calmed down because there wasn’t much they could do,” he said. Dmitri’s refusal to fight highlights some of the military difficulties the Russian army has faced as a result of the Kremlin’s political decision not to formally declare war on Ukraine – preferring instead to describe the invasion, which will soon reach its fourth month, as a “special military operation”. On Wednesday, Daniel Boffey and Pjotr Sauer had an exclusive story revealing that three Russian prisoners of war accused of targeting or murdering civilians, and a soldier who allegedly killed a man before raping his wife, are set to be in the dock in the first war crimes trials of the Ukraine conflict. More than 10,700 crimes have been registered since the war began by the office of Ukraine’s prosecutor general, led by Iryna Venediktova, and a handful of cases have now been filed or are ready to be submitted in what marks a watershed moment two months into the war. Vadim Shysimarin, a 21-year-old commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division, who is in Ukrainian custody, appeared in a Kyiv court on Friday as the first to face trial over his alleged murder of a 68-year-old man. It is alleged Shysimarin, a sergeant, had been fighting in the Sumy region in north-east Ukraine when he killed a civilian on 28 February in the village of Chupakhivka. He is accused of driving a stolen car with four other soldiers as he sought to flee Ukrainian fighters and then shooting dead the unarmed man on a bicycle as he was talking on his phone. Shysimarin was ordered “to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders”, according to prosecutors. The aim was to be the invisible man, says Igor Pedin, 61. It was to drift, as if a ghost, with his small trolley bag of supplies and dog Zhu-Zhu, a nine-year-old mongrel terrier, through the hellscape of the besieged port city of Mariupol, out into the badlands of Russian-occupied territories and on to the relative safety of the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhia – a mere 225km walk away. Pedin sidestepped mines and crossed destroyed bridges with his dog and luggage, passing smouldering homes and weeping men and women with heartbreaking stories of death and suffering. He also had to contend with nervous, trigger-happy Russian soldiers. But miraculously he made it and has told Daniel Boffey his extraordinary story.

5/14/2022,"There were two lovers, Roland and Marianne, who lived in London, New York or maybe Dublin, now and never, once and always. Nick Payne’s 2012 play lifts us from this current moment, offering a wider and infinitely giddier view of existence. Whether seen through the eyes of Roland the beekeeper (Brian Gleeson), or of Marianne the quantum physicist (Sarah Morris), the familiar essentials of a love story are opened up to encompass multiple possibilities and alternative outcomes. In Mark Atkinson Borrull’s buoyant production, the ramifications of each scene play out like an intricate dance. Key moments in the couple’s relationship – meeting, first date, break-up, reunion, illness – are performed in fragments, with different inflections and outcomes each time, representing Marianne’s view that everything exists simultaneously in the multiverse. No matter which version of Marianne’s story she is playing, Morris is open and impassioned, with Gleeson’s droll, sometimes bewildered Roland a perfectly understated foil to her energy. Beneath a canopy of chandeliers the couple’s image is reflected in designer Molly O’Cathain’s mirrored surfaces and ceiling, with snapping shifts in time and place gorgeously created by Paul Keogan’s clusters of light and Liz Roche’s movement direction. Wrapped in levity, the play does not lose sight of the larger questions: about reality, time, chance, free will, choice, death. Reflecting a non-linear view of cause and effect, the play circles back to a central scene in which Marianne’s language is breaking down due to illness. First she speaks in single words, then letters, later in sign language. “We have all the time we’ve always had,” she says, as if this is a matter of perception and choice. Roland may or may not choose to agree.
