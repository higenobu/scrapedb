3/8/2022,"By Jan Wolfe WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A federal prosecutor accused a Texas man of being ""a leader"" of the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol by Donald Trump supporters as she wrapped up arguments on Monday in the first criminal trial of someone accused of joining the riot. Guy Reffitt of Texas, is the first of some 750 people charged with joining in the riot to face trial in Washington. ""Every mob needs leaders, and this defendant was a leader that day,"" Justice Department lawyer Risa Berkower told jurors. ""When the defendant stepped to the front of the crowd, he forced the Capitol Police into an impossible last stand to protect the people inside."" Reffitt's lawyer, William Welch, argued that Reffitt is only guilty of entering a restricted area and should be cleared of more serious charges. ""As soon as he was pepper-sprayed, that was the end of it,"" Welch said of his client, adding that Reffitt embellished his own role to seem important. ""This case has been a rush to judgment, most of it based on bragging and a lot of hype,"" Welch told jurors. ""Be the grown-ups in the courtroom. Separate the fact from the hype."" The jury is scheduled to begin deliberating on Tuesday. Reffitt faces five felony charges, including bringing a gun onto the Capitol grounds and obstructing an official proceeding. Reffitt's estranged son Jackson, now 19, turned him into the FBI and testified against him last week. If convicted of the most serious charges against him, Reffitt faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, though defendants rarely receive maximum penalties. Thousands of people stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, after a fiery speech in which Trump falsely claimed his election defeat was the result of widespread fraud, an assertion rejected by multiple courts, state election officials and members of his own administration. Reffitt never entered the Capitol, but video showed him egging on the crowd and leading other rioters up some outdoor stairs. Reffitt, who wore a bulletproof vest and a helmet, persisted up the staircase even as police officers pelted him with pepper balls and doused him with chemical spray. In a video clip played for jurors, Reffitt repeatedly urged rioters to drag House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other lawmakers out of the Capitol. ""I didn't come here to play — I'm taking the Capitol,"" Reffitt said. ""I just want to see Pelosi's head hitting every stair on the way out."" Some 200 defendants have already pleaded guilty to charges relating to the attack, which sent lawmakers running for their lives. Reffitt's trial is an important test case as prosecutors attempt to secure convictions from the hundreds who have not taken plea deals.

""Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below."" Blood type doesn’t affect much in our daily lives. In fact, most people don’t even know whether they’re Type A, B, AB, or O. But the seemingly-banal detail might be a factor in who comes under the thumb of 2020’s world-wide tyrant—that is, coronavirus. A new study in the journal PLOS Genetics revealed that people with Type A blood are more likely to have a severe case of Covid-19. A previous study in the journal Blood Advances from 2020 also affirmed this research, adding that people with Type O blood seem to be more protected from Covid-19. Researchers in China first shared this idea back in March 2020, and the findings were echoed by a paper out of Columbia University a month later. Even DNA testing company 23andMe tapped their customers and found that among 750,000 people (by far the biggest study population yet) who were diagnosed and hospitalized for COVID-19, those with type O were more protected. Then, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine confirmed the idea with a peer-reviewed study: Folks with Type A blood were 45 percent more likely to become infected with COVID-19 than those with other blood types, while those with Type O were 35 percent less likely. ""It's pretty clear that Type O is protective to some degree. I don't think that having Type A or Type B is the problem—it's just that they don't have Type O,"" says Mark Udden, MD, professor of hematology and oncology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. So people with Type A may be more likely to catch the virus, but whether they also get it worse is still unclear: the NEJM study reports that people with Type A blood were also more likely to have respiratory failure. However, the research out of Columbia University found there wasn’t really any difference among intubations or death and different blood types. And a 2020 study in the Annals of Hematology looked specifically at the link between blood types and the need for intubation or death in confirmed COVID-19 patients. They found no link between blood type and the severity of the illness. The new research in Blood Advances, mentioned above, had similar findings. Although true to the unending questions around the disease, another, smaller study, also in Blood Advances, suggested that blood types A or AB had higher risk of certain intense interventions and longer ICU stays, but the researchers themselves considered the link to be so far “unresolved.” We don’t know why people with Type O might possibly be more protected—but there are a lot of theories. The most basic idea is that blood type might influence a person’s ability to fight the virus, says David Aronoff, M.D., director of the division of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. It may affect your immune system’s strength or your inflammatory response to the infection. Either way, that would color how likely you are to not only get the virus but also how strong your symptoms are, he explains. The NEJM paper, however, highlights the antibodies we produce depending on blood type. “If you’re type O, you naturally make antibodies against Type A and Type B,” Dr. Udden says. These Type A antibodies might make it more difficult for SARS-CoV-2 to attach to its receptor in Type O blood and multiply in the body, he explains. But there’s another interesting layer to a potential protective element in Type O blood: something called von Willebrand factor, which is a glycoprotein in charge of repairing damage to blood vessels by prompting your blood to clot. We know the COVID-19 virus damages the lining of your blood vessels. Your body then releases von Willebrand factor, or VWF, into your blood so it can fix the damage to the vessel walls. But VWF also encourages clotting. “In COVID-19 patients who die, we're seeing unusually high clotting issues, like strokes, kidney failure, and pulmonary embolisms—so we know there is a clotting problem that stems from the virus,” Dr. Udden says. A 2020 analysis in The Lancet found that compared to COVID-19 patients who weren’t in intensive care, those who were critically ill in the ICU and died had higher VWF antigens in their blood. And guess what: People with Type A blood have higher levels of VWF naturally than people with type O blood, Dr. Udden points out. In addition, people who are Black, who are dying at a disproportionately high rate from COVID-19, tend to have higher levels of VWF, too. Just because you’re Type O doesn’t mean you’re in the clear. All studies so far have only looked at blood type in connection to symptomatic cases of coronavirus, Dr. Aronoff points out. We don’t know about asymptomatic carriers—that is, Type O could still pass along the virus to other people unknowingly just as much as Type A could. ""There are two possibilities: You're Type O so you might not contract the virus because it has no landing strip—there's nothing to attach to,"" Dr. Udden explains. ""Or by being Type O, the virus gets in but the A antibody prevents it from docking with enough cells to cause disease. But the virus is still in your system and you can still pass it to someone else."" No. Blood type is actually a pretty weak player, Dr. Udden says. Socio-economic status is a big vulnerability—likely to need to work outside the home, in crowded buildings, and living in tighter quarters with more family members. Age and health are next in line for susceptibility. If you’re older or have an underlying disease like cancer, diabetes, or heart disease, you’re more likely to develop a severe case of coronavirus, Dr. Udden adds. Blood type is after all of these. People with Type O blood might be slightly more protected from the virus, and people with Type A slightly more vulnerable. But, as far as we know, everyone is still at risk of getting the virus, and definitely at risk of being an asymptomatic carrier—and therefore of spreading it to others. The discovery of Type O’s protective effect is crucial to building an understanding of how the virus works—especially considering there aren’t many other patterns it follows, Dr. Udden points out. But both docs agree it shouldn’t actually change anyone’s behavior. “I’m Type O, and I’m not going to go hang out in bars just because of this slight protective effect,” Dr. Udden says. “These findings shouldn’t change your behavior. Anyone can still get ill with SARS-CoV-2 and/or participate in the chain of transmission,” Dr. Aronoff adds. The bottom line is clear: The safest and most effective way to prevent from getting coronavirus or unknowingly spreading it to others is to keep wearing a mask, getting vaccinated, and socially distancing from people—regardless of your blood type.

3/8/2022,"LVIV, Ukraine (AP) — The humanitarian crisis in Ukraine deepened Monday as Russian forces intensified their shelling and food, water, heat and medicine grew increasingly scarce, in what the country condemned as a medieval-style siege by Moscow to batter it into submission. A third round of talks between the two sides ended with a top Ukrainian official saying there had been minor, unspecified progress toward establishing safe corridors that would allow civilians to escape the fighting. Russia’s chief negotiator said he expects those corridors to start operating Tuesday. But that remained to be seen, given the failure of previous attempts to lead civilians to safety amid the biggest ground war in Europe since World War II. Well into the second week of the invasion, with Russian troops making significant advances in southern Ukraine but stalled in some other regions, a top U.S. official said multiple countries were discussing whether to provide the warplanes that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been pleading for. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces continued to pummel cities with rockets, and fierce fighting raged in places. In one of the most desperate cities, the encircled southern port of Mariupol, an estimated 200,000 people — nearly half the population of 430,000 — were hoping to flee, and Red Cross officials waited to hear when a corridor would be established. The city is short on water, food and power, and cellphone networks are down. Stores have been looted as residents search for essential goods. Police moved through the city, advising people to remain in shelters until they heard official messages broadcast over loudspeakers to evacuate. Hospitals in Mariupol are facing severe shortages of antibiotics and painkillers, and doctors performed some emergency procedures without them. The lack of phone service left anxious citizens approaching strangers to ask if they knew relatives living in other parts of the city and whether they were safe. In the capital, Kyiv, soldiers and volunteers have built hundreds of checkpoints to protect the city of nearly 4 million, often using sandbags, stacked tires and spiked cables. Some barricades looked significant, with heavy concrete slabs and sandbags piled more than two stories high, while others appeared more haphazard, with hundreds of books used to weigh down stacks of tires. “Every house, every street, every checkpoint, we will fight to the death if necessary,” said Mayor Vitali Klitschko. In Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, with 1.4 million people, heavy shelling slammed into apartment buildings. “I think it struck the fourth floor under us,” Dmitry Sedorenko said from his Kharkiv hospital bed. “Immediately, everything started burning and falling apart.” When the floor collapsed beneath him, he crawled out through the third story, past the bodies of some of his neighbors. Klitschko reported that fierce battles continued in the Kyiv region, notably around Bucha, Hostomel, Vorzel and Irpin. In the Irpin area, which has been cut off from electricity, water and heat for three days, witnesses saw at least three tanks and said Russian soldiers were seizing houses and cars. A few miles away, in the small town of Horenka, where shelling reduced one area to ashes and shards of glass, rescuers and residents picked through the ruins as chickens pecked around them. “What are they doing?” rescue worker Vasyl Oksak asked of the Russian attackers. “There were two little kids and two elderly people living here. Come in and see what they have done.” In the south, Russian forces also continued their offensive in Mykolaiv, opening fire on the Black Sea shipbuilding center of a half-million people, according to Ukraine’s military. Rescuers said they were putting out fires caused by rocket attacks in residential areas. At The Hague, Netherlands, Ukraine pleaded with the International Court of Justice to order a halt to Russia’s invasion, saying Moscow is committing widespread war crimes. Russia “is resorting to tactics reminiscent of medieval siege warfare, encircling cities, cutting off escape routes and pounding the civilian population with heavy ordnance,” said Jonathan Gimblett, a member of Ukraine’s legal team. Russia snubbed the court proceedings, leaving its seats in the Great Hall of Justice empty. Efforts to set up safe passage for civilians over the weekend fell apart amid continued Russian shelling. Before Monday's talks began, Russia announced a new plan, saying civilians would be allowed to leave Kyiv, Mariupol, Kharkiv and Sumy. Later, Russia’s U.N. Ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, told the U.N. Security Council that Russia would carry out a cease-fire Tuesday morning and open humanitarian corridors leading away from Kyiv, Mariupol, Sumy and Chernigov. Zelenskyy expressed skepticism about the sincerity of the gestures, asserting in his daily video address that instead of an agreement on humanitarian corridors, what Ukraine got on Monday was “Russian tanks, Russian Grad rockets, Russian mines.” Many of the evacuation routes headed toward Russia or its ally Belarus, which has served as a launch pad for the invasion. Ukraine instead proposed eight routes allowing civilians to travel to western regions of the country where there is no shelling. The U.N. humanitarian chief, Undersecretary-General Martin Griffiths, addressed the Security Council and urged safe passage for people to go “in the direction they choose.” The battle for Mariupol is crucial because its capture could allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to Crimea, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014. The fighting has sent energy prices surging worldwide and stocks plummeting, and threatens t he food supply and livelihoods  of people around the globe who rely on crops farmed in the fertile Black Sea region. The U.N. human rights office reported 406 confirmed civilian deaths but said the real number is much higher. The invasion has also sent 1.7 million people fleeing Ukraine. On Monday, Moscow again announced a series of demands to stop the invasion, including that Ukraine recognize Crimea as part of Russia and recognize the eastern regions controlled by Moscow-supported separatist fighters as independent. It also insisted that Ukraine change its constitution to guarantee it won’t join international bodies like NATO and the EU. Ukraine has already rejected those demands. He has called for more punitive measures against Russia, including a global boycott of its oil exports, which are key to its economy. “If (Russia) doesn’t want to abide by civilized rules, then they shouldn’t receive goods and services from civilization,"" he said in a video address. He has also asked for more warplanes. Deputy U.S. Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said officials are ""trying to see whether this is possible and doable.” While the West has been rushing weapons to Ukraine such as anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, some officials fear that sending warplanes could be seen by Moscow as direct involvement in the war. One possible scenario under discussion: Former Soviet bloc nations that are now NATO members could send Ukraine their own Soviet-era MiGs, which Ukrainian pilots are trained to fly, and the U.S. would then replace those countries' aircraft with American-made F-16s. Russia's invasion has nearby countries terrified the war could spread to them. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken began a lightning visit  to the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, former Soviet republics that are NATO members. Blinken hoped to reassure them of the alliance’s protection. NATO has shown no interest in sending troops into the country and has rejected Zelenskyy's pleas to establish a no-fly zone for fear of triggering a wider war. ___ Associated Press reporters from around the world contributed to this report. ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the Ukraine crisis at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",World/Associated Press,"Crisis deepens, Ukraine accuses Moscow of 'medieval' tactics",https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-says-evacuations-stall-amid-050202645.html
3/8/2022,"Patriarch Kirill, the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, delivered a sermon Sunday in which he referred to the war in Ukraine as a ""metaphysical"" struggle against a godless international order.

Putin frequently accuses the West of ""denying moral principles and all traditional identities"" while portraying Russia as the guardian of ""the Christian values that constitute the basis of Western civilization."" Only around six percent of Russians attend church regularly. Russia also has the highest abortion rate in the world. Kirill, a strong supporter of Putin, urged his flock on Sunday not to ""put up with … those who promote sin"" — specifically homosexuality — ""as an example or as one of the models of human behavior."" He also said Orthodox Christians who oppose the war are ""humbly follow[ing] the path that the powers that be show them.""

Blinken later met Latvia's Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics in Riga on Monday as well as the prime minister and president. Rinkevics called for a permanent presence of U.S. troops in the Baltic country. ""We have no illusions about Putin's Russia anymore, we don't really see any good reason to assume Russia might change its policy,"" Rinkevics told a joint news conference with Blinken.

Some 400 U.S. troops from the First Armored Brigade Combat Team would be arriving in Lithuania in the coming days, Blinken said. The Lithuanian government later announced an agreement to ramp up military spending this year, with additional funds to be spent on Javelin anti-tank weapons, battle drones, optical sights and other gear as well as upgrades to its military bases. Lithuania also joined Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in calling for an embargo on Russian energy. Blinken said on Sunday the United States and European allies were exploring banning imports of Russian oil. ""Energy sources which we import pay for the Russian military operation. We cannot pay for oil and gas with the blood of Ukraine,"" Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis told a joint news conference with Blinken. Russian gas cannot be easily replaced, however. Norway, Europe's second largest supplier, is already operating at maximum capacity, and Europe's existing LNG terminals have limited available capacity to absorb extra supply.
