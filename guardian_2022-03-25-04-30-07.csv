3/25/2022,"More than a few business chancers have appeared before Commons select committees over the years, but it’s hard to recall a chief executive who has admitted that his company carefully assessed its options and decided that breaking the law was its best bet. Peter Hebblethwaite of P&O Ferries, the firm that sacked 800 seafarers last week, offered candour and cynicism in the same breath. “There’s absolutely no doubt that we were required to consult the unions. We chose not to do that,” he said. For good measure, he said that he would take the same decision again. Naturally, Hebblethwaite laced his account with pleas that P&O Ferries wasn’t viable unless it replaced its UK crew with foreign agency workers being paid salaries as low as £5.15 an hour. No doubt he’s correct about the many millions P&O has been losing amid the pandemic and energy crises, but this was a brazen attempt to claim that protecting wealthy parent DP World’s investment was more important than staying within the law. Trade unions would never accept P&O Ferries’ proposals, said Hebblethwaite, so there was no point negotiating with them. Via video link from Dubai, Jesper Kristensen, chief operating officer of marine services at DP World, weighed in that P&O Ferries was not a rogue part of the corporate empire. Hebblethwaite would not be sacked, the mass dismissal of the UK crew had been blessed in advance and DP loved doing business in the UK, where its major investments are the Thames and Solent port terminals. Government ministers spluttered in the following session to explain why they hadn’t immediately run off to the high court last week. The gist of it was that the Insolvency Service must be given time to get on top of the legal details. In due course, ministers would look to close any loopholes in the law to better protect employees. Wherever those subplots lead, one move for the government ought to be straightforward: DP World, for all its wealth and state backing, cannot be considered a suitable partner for the UK’s freeport programme. A company that declares a casual relationship with UK employment laws does not belong in a government-backed scheme. Nor, frankly, should it be here at all. Don’t call our 15-year stress test a forecast or a plan, it’s a “scenario”, said Next. Even with that qualification, chief executive Simon Wolfson’s sums were striking: the retail group could generate £14.7bn of cash between now and 2037. That’s an upgrade of £2.4bn on the last time the modelling was done in 2019. For aficionados, the underlying assumptions were laid out in colourful detail, including the critical input that like-for-like sales in the shops are assumed to decline at a rate of 10% a year. The cashflow magic, as it were, arrives via steady reductions in store rents and an assumed 6.4%-a-year increase in online sales. The long perspective made Next’s £10m trim to this year’s profit forecast, and the likely effects of higher prices and “chronic labour shortages”, feel almost minor. In practice, the volatility looks a proper challenge, but, yes, there’s every reason to think the structure is capable of handling most stresses, which was the deep message in Next’s projections. The credibility of a 15-year outlook is improved after many years of success and when the boss has done two decades in post and has no plans to retire. But more companies should try their hand at mapping the horizon in public. Most say they’re in the game of attracting long-term shareholders; this is one way to show they mean it. Renault has been shockingly slow to concede that its presence in Russia had become untenable, but the rouble has finally dropped in the boardroom. The group has suspended operations at its Moscow factory and is considering a sale of its majority stake in Avtovaz, which owns the Lada brand. The size of Renault’s investment in Russia explains the slowness of the decision-making, but does not excuse it. It has been obvious for weeks that a firm 15%-owned by the French state could not continue to support Russia’s largest car manufacturer. It should not have taken a public shaming by Ukrainian politicians to reach this point. Other western multinationals who are hoping that their lower-profile operations in Russia will escape scrutiny should take note. We’re well into overtime for reviewing.",News/Business,"P&O may not regret breaking law, but the UK should regret dealing with its owner | Nils Pratley",https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/mar/24/p-and-o-dubai-dp-world-britain-freeport
3/25/2022,"He did not shove the prime minister of Montenegro at a photo-op, he did not call the British prime minister and German chancellor “losers” and he did not deride Nato as a bunch of grifters looking for a free lunch. So low was the bar set by former US president Donald Trump that, merely by condemning Russia’s Vladimir Putin rather than gushing over his biceps, Joe Biden earned good will on his unity and resolve tour of Europe. The president came to Brussels on Thursday with promises to accept up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees fleeing the month-long Russian invasion, give $1bn in new humanitarian aid and impose sanctions on 300 members of the Russian parliament. It was an attempt to project reassurance that Biden, born during the second world war, can emulate President Franklin Roosevelt’s “great arsenal of democracy” without stumbling into a third. But the 79-year-old’s handshakes and whispers with France’s Emmanuel Macron and others at the Nato, G7 and European Council summits may put the seal on the Obama paradox: an American president more popular abroad than at home. Gallup surveys conducted before Russia invaded Ukraine showed the image of US leadership making a significant recovery from the Trump era. “Between 2020 and 2021, American leadership saw double-digit gains in 20 of the 27 Nato members surveyed both years,” the polling firm said. That stands in vivid contrast with Biden’s approval rating within the US, which this week fell to a new low of 40%, according to a Reuters/ Ipsos opinion poll. The survey found that 54% of Americans disapprove of his job performance as the country struggles with high inflation. Biden’s approval rating matched Trump’s at this point in his presidency: both stood at 40% in mid-March in their second year in office. The relief of western allies at having America back at the table is unlikely to be reflected by domestic voters in the midterm elections in November. That is why Republicans are hammering away at Biden by urging him to do more for Ukraine though with few specific details and, more loudly and convincingly to the electorate, by blaming him for soaring gas prices at home. They intend to prove the old adage that all politics is local. The point was illustrated on prime time cable news television on Wednesday night. CNN’s Anderson Cooper opened his show with coverage of the war in Ukraine; Tucker Carlson, on the conservative Fox News channel, talked instead about supreme court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson declining to offer a definition of “woman” during her Senate confirmation hearing. CNN’s Reliable Sources newsletter noted: “As Cooper showed horrifying drone footage of the widespread devastation in Mariupol, Carlson showed his audience a sex-ed type graphic of the female reproductive system.” It observed: “Four weeks after the war commenced, there are signs that fatigue is setting in. TV news ratings, for instance, have started to fall back to reality after ballooning early on. And perhaps another sign is the return of culture idiocy that is once again saturating channels like Fox and social media feeds.” It is a further reminder to be grateful that Trump no longer has his finger on the Twitter button – or the nuclear one. The man who once posed the biggest threat to global democracy has been replaced in that role by Putin. Biden beat one and must now thwart the other. So far that has meant a “Goldilocks” approach – not too hot, not too cold, not too weak, not too provocative. This received a boost on Thursday when Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy delivered a video address to Nato from Kyiv that did not, according to White House officials, include calls for a no-fly zone or Nato membership, giving Biden some breathing room. Still, a frustrated Zelinskiy naturally urged Nato to stiffen its spine and do more, and it remains unclear how Biden will respond if an increasingly desperate Putin resorts to biological, chemical or even nuclear weapons. Western unity will be tested as the costs of war bite into the global economy. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, dismissed calls to follow the US by boycotting Russian energy supplies, warning: “To do so from one day to the next would mean plunging our country and all of Europe into recession.” The president who made a contest between democracy and autocracy the guiding principle of his foreign policy will also be aware that Thursday’s meetings are being watched closely by China, which has sent mixed signals about the invasion and may yet give Putin military support. Nato’s determined response, and the underperformance of the bogged down Russian army, may serve as a warning to Chinese president Xi Jinping and scramble his calculus for an assault on Taiwan. Larry Diamond, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution think tank in Palo Alto, California, told reporters this week: “Xi is pissed as hell because it completely changes the timeline and the dynamics of the situation. “The most fascinating dimension of this crisis right now is to watch Xi Jinping be completely tied up in knots over what to do about this. He and the senior Chinese leadership are clearly struggling for a narrative and a response.” Standing against a blue backdrop dotted with Nato logos. Biden addressed the issue of Chinese intervention at a press conference. He recalled that, in a recent call with Xi, he pointed out that many US and foreign corporations have left Russia. “I indicated that he would be putting himself in significant jeopardy. I think that China understands that its economic futures are much more closely tied to the west than it is to Russia. So I’m hopeful that he does not get engaged.” He reiterated his message to Brussels that America is back. But towards the end of the question and answer session, someone raised European concerns that Trump might get re-elected in 2024 – raising the spectre of a return to the uncertainty, insults and Putin-praise singing. The president replied: “One of the things I take some solace from is I don’t think you’ll find any European leader who thinks that I am not up to the job… I don’t criticise anybody for asking that question. But the next election, I’d be very fortunate if I had that same man running against me.” Steeped in foreign policy after decades as a senator and vice-president, Biden is likely to be thinking about geopolitical questions in terms of decades. Unfortunately for him, his political legacy could be decided by Tucker Carlson and viewers’ demand for instant gratification.",News/World news,Biden seeks to reassure Europe as he walks tightrope over Ukraine crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/24/biden-europe-visit-nato-ukraine-crisis
3/25/2022,"The human rights group Reprieve has demanded Formula One ends its association with Saudi Arabian sportswashing after the family of a teenager sentenced to death wrote to Lewis Hamilton pleading with him to speak out on their son’s behalf before this weekend’s race. In documents sent from Abdullah al-Howaiti’s prison cell and seen by the Guardian, he cites the torture and abuse he says he has suffered at the hands of the Saudi authorities as F1 once more prepares to race in the country which recently carried out 81 executions in a single day. In a report issued in January, a group of UN experts classified some of Saudi Arabia’s violations of international law as potentially “crimes against humanity” as the state continues to execute minors. When Saudi Arabia held its first grand prix last year Hamilton was critical of F1’s decision to race there. “Do I feel comfortable here? I wouldn’t say I do,” he said. “But it’s not my choice to be here, the sport has taken the choice to be here.” Howaiti was arrested when he was 14, accused of the robbery of a jewellery store during which a policeman was killed. His family maintain, with CCTV evidence and written statements from witnesses, that he was nowhere near the store at the time but with friends. He has stated in diary entries from prison seen exclusively by the Guardian that after arrest he was repeatedly tortured until he signed a blank piece of paper as a confession. “He continued beating me, and every time I took my foot off the table, he beat me on my body until I passed out. He poured water on my face and turned on the air conditioning on cold and made me stand against it for half an hour,” Howaiti records , and also states that he was forced to participate in torturing his own brother. He was originally sentenced to death in 2019 when he was 17. Saudi Arabia’s supreme court overturned the sentence last year but this month he was once more sentenced to death. Regardless of the doubt as to his guilt or otherwise, the sentence stands in contradiction to Saudi Arabia’s repeated public claims that no one in the country will be executed for a crime committed as a minor. His family have made a heartfelt plea to Hamilton to intervene. “Our cries for justice have not been heard,” they wrote to the seven-time world champion. “Maybe, if you say his name, those who decide his fate will listen. Will you raise your voice to save Abdullah? Whether this is in private conversations with the authorities or in public while you are here in Saudi Arabia to race, we believe it can make a difference.” The United Nations’ Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has issued a damning assessment of Howaiti’s case. It stated serious doubts over the legitimacy of his trial, that the courts ignored his age, in breach of the UN convention on the rights of the child, and that there is a systemic problem with arbitrary detention in Saudi Arabia, noting: “Widespread or systematic imprisonment or other severe deprivation of liberty in violation of the rules of international law may constitute crimes against humanity.” The UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, condemned the recent executions and reported the UN believed that of the 81 convicted of “terror offences”, 41 were Muslims from the Shia minority who had taken part in anti-government protests, calling for greater political participation. Last week the sport’s chief executive, Stefano Domenicali, said he was “alarmed” at the executions but insisted F1 could “shine a spotlight” on human rights abuses. The Reprieve director, Maya Foa, dismissed his argument. She said F1’s presence in Saudi Arabia was sportswashing, bringing legitimacy to the regime. “By racing in Saudi Arabia, Formula One is effectively saying that executing people for taking part in pro-democracy protests is OK,” she said. “It’s telling the Saudi authorities they can wash out the bloodstains of a mass execution and show up at the chequered flag days later to hand over a trophy. The almost daily executions this week show they have heard this message loud and clear. “F1 showed it is capable of decisive action to protect human rights when it dropped the Russian GP in a matter of hours. Its failure to respond to Saudi Arabia’s execution crisis is a shameful double standard.” The Saudi authorities were contacted for a comment but did not reply. F1 issued a statement reiterating: “We take our responsibilities on rights very seriously and set high ethical standards for counterparties and those in our supply chain, which are enshrined in contracts, and we pay close attention to their adherence”.",Sport/Sport,F1 faces calls to quit Saudi Arabia while prisoner’s family asks Hamilton to help ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/24/f1-saudi-arabia-lewis-hamilton-abdullah-al-howaiti-human-rights
3/25/2022,"Michael Grade, the Tory peer who has been put forward as the government’s choice to chair the broadcasting regulator Ofcom, is one of the most familiar behind-the-scenes figures in British TV. Lord Grade was born into a royal family of UK showbusiness. His father, Leslie, was an agent who booked stars such as Bob Hope, his uncle Lew was one of the founders of ITV and his uncle Bernard – a Delfont – was a theatre mogul and one-time boss of the record business EMI. Once known for his red braces and fat cigars, the 79-year-old’s appointment as Ofcom chair follows a long stint of top broadcasting roles in a career spanning four decades. He has worked at the BBC, ITV and Channel 4, where he was nicknamed “the pornographer in chief” after he sanctioned controversial late-night programmes such as The Word, Eurotrash and Dyke TV. Born in 1943, Grade began his media career in 1960 as a journalist and sports columnist at the Daily Mirror. After a stint in theatre management, he switched back to media to work in entertainment programming at London Weekend Television. After a relatively short spell in the US, where he cruised Los Angeles in an open-top pink Cadillac, Grade returned in 1984 to become controller of BBC One. There he changed early-evening viewing habits with EastEnders and Neighbours. In 1988, he moved to Channel 4 as chief executive, where the occasionally racy programming prompted the Daily Mail to give him the nickname Britain’s “pornographer-in-chief”. One of the most notorious incidents of his career occurred at Channel 4 when he became involved in a dispute with the iconoclast satirist Chris Morris over his Brass Eye series. Grade reportedly repeatedly intervened in the production to order edits to various episodes. Morris ultimately responded by inserting a frame stating “Grade is a cunt” into its final episode. While chief executive of Channel 4, he campaigned against its privatisation, but has changed his mind in recent years and spoken out in favour of the proposal. In 1997, he quit Channel 4. After time as chief executive of bingo giant First Leisure and chair of Pinewood Studios, Grade returned to the BBC in 2004 as chairman. The BBC looked like a job until retirement, but in 2006 Grade was dramatically lured to ITV, on a mission to restore its fortunes. He left three years later, however, accused by some of failing to produce the expected string of entertainment hits. In the Grade years, the shares at ITV plunged 50% and its cash-strapped rival Virgin Media considered a takeover, which forced Sky to snap up a 17% stake to block the deal. Grade, however, insists his stint at ITV was a success because the broadcaster survived the recession, without a cash call on investors, and built shows such as Britain’s Got Talent and The X-Factor. Grade revealed his membership of the Conservative party for the first time in May 2010. On 25 January 2011, he was created a life peer, as Lord Grade of Yarmouth.",News/Media,Michael Grade’s Ofcom appointment seals long career in broadcasting,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/24/michael-grades-ofcom-appointment-seals-long-career-in-broadcasting
3/25/2022,"European Union leaders are set to clash over whether to stop buying oil and gas from Russia, following a show of transatlantic unity in a series of summits with Joe Biden and an impassioned appeal by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, for more military aid to defend his country. In the third summit on a hectic day of diplomacy that began with an emergency meeting of Nato leaders, followed by the G7, the US president is due to meet the European Council to discuss Russia’s war against Ukraine. The EU leaders will also hear a separate video address from Zelenskiy, four weeks since the war broke out, when he told them in a conference call that they might not see him alive again. The EU meeting is heavy with symbolism, but officials have dampened talk of further sanctions. Poland and the Baltic states are leading the charge for tougher measures against Russia. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said the EU needed to “crush” Russia with sanctions over the war, which he said has turned into a “massacre”. Referring to the Soviet Union, he said Russia was trying “to re-establish the ‘empire of evil’”. Latvia’s prime minister, Arturs Krišjānis Kariņš, said energy sanctions were a “serious option” the EU should look at, starting with oil and coal. “Energy sanctions immediately are a way to stop money flowing into Putin’s coffers,” he said. “Every day that we delay sanctioning Russia’s economy, Russia maintains the ability to feed its military machine.” The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said the west was ready to impose further sanctions on Russia, which he said were having an impact. Germany, which gets 55% of its gas imports from Russia, however, has warned that an immediate ban would cause unemployment and stop drivers filling their cars. To stop using Russian energy “from one day to the next would mean plunging our country and all of Europe into recession”, the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said on Wednesday. He was supported by Belgium’s prime minister, Alexander de Croo, who said an oil embargo “would have a devastating effect on the European economy and I don’t think it’s necessary”. After four rounds of far-reaching EU sanctions in three weeks, targeting Vladimir Putin, his inner circle and large parts of the Russian economy, there are growing tensions among EU leaders about the next steps. Luxembourg’s prime minister, Xavier Bettel, argued that further sanctions should be “a reaction to something”, referring to chemical and biological weapons, amid growing alarm that Putin will resort to them. “If we take sanctions now, more sanctions, with the situation that is still the status quo, what will be the next step?” Slovenia’s prime minister, Janez Janša, one of a trio of EU leaders who recently visited Kyiv, said Putin had already crossed red lines with the destruction of Mariupol. “All red lines have already been crossed, so we don’t need to speak about chemical and biological weapons, and to wait for those weapons to be used.” He also dismissed a demand by the Kremlin that western countries pay for Russian gas in roubles - a means for Russia to prop up its ailing currency. Janša said nobody in the EU knew what the Russian currency looked like, and predicted: “Nobody will pay in roubles.” Russia accounts for about 45% of EU gas imports, 25% of oil imports and 45% of coal, but some countries are far more dependent. The European Commission has said Europe could be completely free of Russian fossil fuels “well before 2030” and reduce its consumption of gas by two-thirds within a year. EU leaders have so far eschewed setting a deadline to phase out Russian fossil fuels. However, they are poised to agree on voluntary joint purchasing of gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and hydrogen, in an attempt to lever collective purchasing power “to dampen prices”, according to a draft summit communique. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said the US was going to supply the EU with additional LNG to replace Russian gas that comes via sea tankers – a move that she described as “an important step forward”. She is expected to make the announcement with Biden on Friday. The US is already the biggest supplier of LNG to the EU. The EU and the US will also discuss how to dissuade China from lending its support to Putin, either by delivering arms or helping Russia evade western sanctions. Italy’s prime minister, Mario Draghi, said China could be crucial in the peace process: “They have a lot of leverage, so we are all waiting for them to use it.” Boris Johnson was not invited to attend the EU summit. EU officials said there had never been any plans to invite the British prime minister and insisted this was not linked to his widely condemned remarks comparing the war in Ukraine to the Brexit vote. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, tweeted from Nato HQ that she had had a “good meeting” with Johnson, where they discussed EU-UK cooperation on sanctions.",News/World news,EU leaders meet for talks on oil and gas imports from Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/24/eu-leaders-oil-gas-imports-russia-ukraine
3/25/2022,"The Hollywood Forever cemetery, the final resting place of stars such as Judy Garland, Mickey Rooney and Burt Reynolds, is now a historic-cultural monument. The Los Angeles city council unanimously voted this week to grant the designation to the 123-year-old cemetery, which has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1999. An architectural historian who prepared a report on the cemetery for the city found it “exemplifies significant contributions to the broad cultural, economic or social history”. “It’s truly a special place on so many levels, both in terms of its architecture, and its landscape, but also in terms of the history that contributed to the development of this place,” Heather Goers, the author of the report, told LAist. Some buildings and landscape features at the cemetery, which first opened in 1899, date back to 1903, according to the report. The report recommended the cemetery receive the designation because of its association with the “early development of Hollywood … the development of the cemetery industry in Los Angeles, and … the development of Jewish burial facilities in Los Angeles”. City council members and local officials praised the decision. “It is a long time coming and well deserved for this incredibly historic site that has transitioned not only from being a place of rest, but to being a place now of entertainment and a public square that can be enjoyed by so many of the Los Angeles public,” Brian Curran, the president of Hollywood Heritage Museum, said during a meeting. The 53-acre property, regarded by some as one of the most iconic cemeteries in the world, also serves as a public gathering place, with visitors coming to the site to attend movie screenings, do yoga and walk among the ponds and elaborate mausoleums. Along with stars of Hollywood’s golden age, the cemetery has also been home to colonies of feral cats, who can be spotted resting on gravestones and near mausoleums.",News/US news,"Hollywood Forever cemetery, resting place to the stars, named a historical site",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/24/hollywood-forever-cemetery-resting-place-to-the-stars-named-a-historical-site
3/25/2022,"Sir Frederick Barclay, who along with his twin brother was once one of the UK’s richest men, is relying on his nephews to fund his divorce battle after being evicted from his luxury flat, a court has heard. A high court hearing on Thursday heard that Barclay, 87, has not paid any of the £100m divorce order made almost a year ago and has halved the monthly allowance to his wife of 34 years, Lady Hiroko Barclay. The owner of the Telegraph media group as well as a number of other businesses now faces the prospect of a prison sentence, or a hefty fine, if found guilty of contempt of court for failing to pay a lump sum of £50m due last August. The full sum of £100m is due this May, making the award one of the UK’s biggest court cases. His 79-year-old wife also faces legal debts of £500,000 after Barclay defaulted on paying her legal fees, the court was told. Barclay’s lawyer, Charles Howard QC, told the court that Barclay’s daughter Amanda was no longer paying her father’s legal costs, which were now being funded by his nephews by way of a loan. Until last summer, Barclay was in a separate legal dispute with his twin brother’s sons, Aidan, Howard and Alistair, over claims that they bugged his private conversations with his daughter while trying to sell the Ritz hotel, which they sold last year. The family members settled after the sudden death of Sir Frederick’s twin brother, Sir David Barclay, in January 2021, but the court case is estimated to have cost millions of pounds. After a court hearing which was largely in person, with only Barclay attending via video link, Mr Justice Jonathan Cohen adjourned the case to obtain further evidence as to Sir Frederick’s mental capacity to conduct proceedings. A monthly allowance to Lady Barclay has been halved from £60,000 a month without warning, the court heard. Lady Barclay, who lived with Sir Frederick from the 1970s to the point at which she filed her divorce in 2019, appeared in court alongside her lawyer, Lady Shackleton. In May last year, Cohen was highly critical of Barclay’s behaviour when he sold his yacht for an estimated £125m but failed to use the proceeds to pay his wife, calling it “reprehensible”. He also said: “[Barclay] is a public figure who should have been aware of the potential consequences of disobedience of court orders and his behaviour in the proceedings should not be allowed to pass completely under the radar.” A joint approach by the Guardian, Press Association and Bloomberg News resulted in some of the reporting restrictions in the hearing being lifted. A spokesperson for Barclay and his nephews declined to comment.",News/UK news,"Sir Frederick Barclay relying on nephews to fund divorce battle, court hears",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/24/sir-frederick-barclay-relying-on-nephews-to-fund-divorce-battle-court-hears
3/25/2022,"Nestled at the foot of mansion-studded hills, just north of Los Angeles’ legendary Sunset Boulevard, the seven-story Chateau Marmont has been a mainstay of Hollywood socializing for nearly a century – including in recent years, the venue for Jay-Z and Beyoncé’s ultra-exclusive post-Oscars bash. But the storied Hollywood playground has become a rallying point for a growing labor movement, and this Sunday, scores of Chateau Marmont workers, alleging longstanding rights violations and discrimination by their employer, plan to protest outside the Academy Awards afterparty. That means the Carters and their star-studded guestlist will have to choose whether to cross a picket line to get in. “Hopefully our presence will educate people that they need to go somewhere else,” said Kurt Petersen, the co-president of Unite Here Local 11, a union supporting the service staff, who are not unionized. “This hotel should not be seen any more as the go-to spot in Hollywood until they change the way they treat workers. We’re in a moment in our history where people need to decide which side they are on. “That’s the question everyone needs to ask themselves, including Jay-Z.” A pseudo-European castle, Chateau Marmont has long been a favorite retreat for some of America’s most celebrated cultural figures. Built in 1929 by a Los Angeles attorney and originally intended as a top-flight apartment building for wealthy New Yorkers moving West, the Chateau was converted into a hotel after the Great Depression and has cultivated an air of exclusivity ever since. Luminaries from F Scott Fitzgerald to Sofia Coppola have produced work at the building, and the hotel has made countless appearances in popular music, film, and literature, including references in songs by the Grateful Dead, Miley Cyrus and Lana Del Rey. Since 1990, the hotel has been run by André Balazs, an elite hotelier and celebrity in his own right, known for his romantic relationships with A-listers. All these associations with stars have only added to the hotel’s premier reputation over the years. That’s all changing now. Since last February, the Chateau’s staff – some of whom have worked at the hotel for decades – have led a fierce boycott that has drawn the support of Hollywood figures including Jane Fonda, Spike Lee, Issa Rae, Gabrielle Union, Samara Wiley, Robin Thede, Ashley Nicole Black and Alfonso Cuarón. Director Aaron Sorkin scrapped a shoot at the hotel for Being the Ricardos; Paramount Plus series The Offer also pulled out of filming there. It’s a dramatic fall from grace for the hotel’s management. In an emailed statement, a spokesperson accused the union of trying to “damage the Chateau Marmont” by orchestrating protests using “paid agitators … most of whom are not former employees and have no connections to the non-union Chateau Marmont.” But the movement has been a vital boost for the workers, whose discontent runs deep over what they have called a toxic environment. Bias appeared to be rife at the hotel. Darker-skinned employees have said they were subjected to racist remarks and passed over for promotions. According to an investigation by the Hollywood Reporter, the Chateau’s managing director, Amanda Grandinetti, referred to one staff member as a “blackie”, and told another that they should respond to her by saying “Yes, Amassa,” apparently in reference to a slave master. In a lawsuit filed against the Chateau last year, April Blackwell, a black woman who worked at the Chateau, said Grandinetti fired her after she complained about a pattern of racist abuse from guests. Grandinetti did not respond to the Guardian’s requests for comment, but she previously acknowledged to the Hollywood Reporter that she “could have advocated more quickly for [her] team”. The Chateau’s female employees have said they were subjected to frequent sexual harassment. Workers painted a grim portrait of Balazs, alleging that the owner would get drunk on the premises and grope female workers – an accusation Balazs has denied. Management also failed to take action when guests touched female employees without their consent, workers alleged. The hotel’s spokesperson said, “These meritless allegations are all unproven for one simple reason: they were manufactured in lawsuits bought and paid for by Unite Here Local 11 as part of their targeted efforts to unionize Chateau Marmont. Contrary to the bogus claims in these already-dismissed, union-backed sham filings, Chateau Marmont has a long and well-documented history of diversity and inclusion among both our employees and our guests.” Things came to a head in 2020. Just before the pandemic hit, Chateau staff approached Unite Here to discuss how they could push for better working conditions, Petersen, the union organizer, said. That effort was shattered in mid-March, as the coronavirus began to spread, when the Chateau’s management abruptly laid off the vast majority of its staff – 248 people – with no severance or extended health insurance. One of those workers was Alejandro Roldan, a 35-year-old full-time housekeeper, who told the Guardian he was making just over $14 an hour at the Chateau before he lost his job, and with it, his health insurance. Then he caught Covid – and decided against a costly hospital visit. But then his symptoms became severe. “I was afraid I was going to die,” he said. It was a blow on top of a workplace accident he suffered just over a month before the layoff, when he was setting up for Jay-Z’s last Oscars party and a glass coffee table shattered, sending shards into his eyes. He made a full recovery, but was hit with more hospital bills, which his employer didn’t help cover. “I was frustrated,” he said. “I was like, I’m losing my vision for someone that doesn’t even support us.” That July, Balazs announced he was reorganizing the property as a members-only club, and would not hire back most of the staff. “It was the best union-busting campaign ever,” Petersen said. “Just fire all the workers and make sure that none of the ones who were standing up for their rights come back to work.” When Roldan and other workers began to protest, members of the Chateau’s management responded by showing up to film and warn them, “we’re watching you.” But the Chateau’s staff pressed on. In May 2020, the hotel workers and Unite Here 11 won the passage of a “right of recall” ordinance in Los Angeles, requiring employers to hire back workers laid off during the pandemic instead of replacing them with new ones. A similar statewide law was passed the following year. In January 2022, the National Labor Relations Board found that Chateau Marmont had illegally surveilled its laid-off workers at protests, in order to disrupt their efforts to organize. The federal labor board negotiated a settlement with the Marmont, requiring that the hotel respect workers’ labor rights and cease its interference with worker organizing. Petersen sees the victories as part of a broader strengthening of labor solidarity between Hollywood’s entertainment and hospitality industries in the wake of the pandemic. “We wouldn’t have this boycott without the solidarity from actors, or from Sag-Aftra, from the Iatse (International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees), from the Teamsters, who have been extraordinary,” he told the Guardian. “Both of our industries suffered tremendous losses during this time in terms of business. Those unions and those members have stood by us.” But Chateau’s workers demands are still far from met. They want their jobs back, and they want clear commitments from Chateau Marmont’s management that it will reform its workplace environment. And they want to form a union, so that they’ll no longer have to feel “alone,” said Roldan. The Chateau Marmont spokesperson said that the hotel has hired more than 50 former employees under the new ordinance, and said the union’s protests had “slowed the process of rehiring former workers.” But Petersen believes that it’s the hotel that’s “slowed the reopening purposely to wear down folks and their willingness to go back.” This Sunday, Roldan will be among the workers picketing Jay-Z’s party. The former housekeeper is still thinking about the injury he suffered at the rapper’s last event. “I just want Jay-Z to support us,” said Roldan. “Every time they go to the hotel, we serve them, we get whatever they want and we’re there for them. So they have to be there for us.” Representatives at Roc Nation, Jay-Z’s company, did not return the Guardian’s request for comment.",News/US news,‘Jay-Z needs to decide which side he’s on’: Chateau Marmont workers to picket star’s Oscars after-party,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/24/chateau-marmont-workers-picket-oscars-party
3/25/2022,"In 2017, Vladimir Putin claimed the nation that mastered artificial intelligence “will be the ruler of the world”. He wanted Russia to be an AI superpower by 2030. After invading Ukraine, he may have to wait rather longer to achieve such supremacy – if he ever does. Sanctions mean Moscow cannot easily access the high-end chips that AI requires. Homegrown substitutes will not cut it. Russia’s leading chip-maker is only capable of mass producing semiconductors last used in computers a decade ago. After being sanctioned, Russia finds itself exposed to geopolitical systems controlled by others. Western nations are tearing up treaties and ending foreign investment. Multinational companies are leaving, often because of reputational concerns rather than any ban. On Thursday, the UK and US announced further sanctions on Russian lawmakers and state-owned companies. Russia’s importance to the globe goes beyond its size as the world’s 11th-largest economy. Reorienting Russian oil, gas and coal exports away from the US and EU to Asian importers would be a big economic shock. Moscow weaponised its gas exports this week by demanding rouble payments from unfriendly European nations. But high oil and gas prices will shift investment back into extractive industries, risking a reversal of the planet-saving trend towards clean energy. Closing off the Black Sea’s Eurasian land bridge would also add pressure to congested sea trade routes. Russia is the source of many essential minerals. About 25 African countries import more than one-third of their wheat from either Russia or Ukraine. The UN’s development arm, Unctad, warned on Thursday that poorer nations face if not unrest then a “profound social malaise” and “a downward spiral of insolvency, recession and arrested development”. Globalisation has been moulded in the interest of big economies. For two decades, powerful nations have treated the internet, finance and industrial supply chains that stretch across the world as webs in which to trap one another. In 2019, the Bank of England reportedly froze $1.2bn of Venezuela’s gold to cut off the regime from its overseas assets – foreshadowing American and European authorities’ actions that have rendered more than half of Russia’s $630bn cash reserves inert. China and India – with $3.4tn and $632bn in reserves – will be paying close attention. Washington’s leverage over the global financial system rests upon banks’ Swift messaging system and dollar dominance. The US has the means to hurt its enemies, but frequently has been undecided on the ends. With Iran’s nuclear programme, Washington wavered between wanting to change the country’s behaviour and wanting to change its regime. In Russia’s case, the latter option becomes more appealing the longer the war in Ukraine lasts. Russia could develop new technologies to break out of this geopolitical cage. Before the first world war, Germany attempted to escape the UK’s stranglehold on the undersea cable network by developing new wireless technologies. Today, Russia may accelerate its “sovereign internet” plans to evade US web surveillance. Wars reshape political – and economic – orders. Mr Putin’s opponents are aiming to apply as much pressure as they can with as little fallout for themselves as possible. They are seeking to manage the risk of a domestic political backlash against their Russian sanctions. Poorer nations will need help or they risk being immiserated. Russia is also not isolated. Unless Mr Putin is no longer Russia’s president, he will probably attend this year’s G20 summit in Indonesia. Nations can – unwittingly or deliberately – turn a blind eye to bans. When Roman Abramovich’s superyacht sailed into a Turkish port this week, it epitomised how reluctant even a Nato member might be in applying sanctions. By acting against Russia, the US and its allies are playing for high stakes. This week, many Muscovites felt the sanctions bite. There have been widespread reports of panic buying in the country’s supermarkets. President Joe Biden’s warning of possible Russian cyber-attacks in response to sanctions might be the beginning of a much more dangerous phase of the economic war.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the sanctions siege: pain felt way beyond Russia | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/24/the-guardian-view-on-the-sanctions-siege-pain-felt-way-beyond-russia
3/25/2022,"The role of the police is to enforce the law and maintain public order. In order that they may do this, officers wield enormous power. Not only are they able to arrest people, depriving them of liberty; they can access all kinds of information about us, enter our property, take away our things. They also set the terms on which political demonstrations and other gatherings can go ahead. Like all powers, these ones can be abused by corrupt groups and individuals. A report from Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services points to a deeply ingrained unwillingness on the part of the Metropolitan police to tackle the corruption that it knows exists in its ranks. It is thanks to the family of Daniel Morgan, who was murdered 35 years ago in a London car park, that the Met and its political bosses are, once again, being forced to reckon with this reality. Public trust in the police has rarely been lower following last year’s horrific abduction, rape and murder of Sarah Everard. Last week’s reports of a black teenage girl strip-searched at school were shocking but not really surprising in the context of a stream of incidents in which officers have failed members of the public whom they are meant to serve. Last month, the Independent Office for Police Conduct revealed that a bullying culture centred on Charing Cross police station had left women and ethnic minority officers fearful and isolated. Now this latest report, focused on corruption, echoes earlier findings with regard to weak leadership as well as flawed processes and culture. To say that whoever replaces Dame Cressida Dick will have their work cut out is an understatement. The Met police needs a complete overhaul, with robust oversight from London’s mayor and the Home Office as well as internal changes. The inspectors rejected last year’s finding by an independent panel that the failed investigation of Daniel Morgan’s murder pointed to “institutional corruption”. Noting that the panel defined this to mean that the Met had prioritised reputation management over everything else, including cooperation with the panel, they called for the official police definition of corruption to be revised. But terminology and motivations aside, it is profoundly unnerving to learn that 100 recent recruits with criminal convictions or connections have not been properly supervised; that vetting processes of staff in highly sensitive posts are weak; and that 2,000 warrant cards are missing. Policing is a hard job, many officers do it well, and there is no satisfaction in saying that public confidence in the Met has collapsed. If it is to be rebuilt, a new leadership team must put an end to the “arrogant, secretive and lethargic” behaviour noted by inspectors. Londoners are entitled to a better service from their police force.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on police corruption: the Met must be rebuilt | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/24/the-guardian-view-on-police-corruption-the-met-must-be-rebuilt
3/25/2022,"Boris Johnson has warned of “catastrophic” consequences for Russia should Vladimir Putin use chemical weapons in Ukraine, though stopped short of saying that would include a military escalation. Speaking after two extraordinary meetings of Nato and the G7, the prime minister also admitted allies were constrained in delivering tanks and jets to Ukraine, despite a direct plea by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Johnson warned the UK is unlikely to supply jets and tanks to Ukraine, amid calls from Zelenskiy for the new heavy weaponry. In a speech at the summit by video link, Zelenskiy did not repeat his call for a no-fly zone but said Ukraine needed jets and tanks from Nato to aid its besieged cities. “You have at least 20,000 tanks! Ukraine asked for a per cent, 1% of all your tanks to be given or sold to us. But we do not have a clear answer yet,” he said. “The worst thing during the war is not having clear answers to requests for help.” Johnson said that the UK was “looking at what we could do to help” with tanks but suggested it was impossible. “Logistically, the moment it looks very difficult for both the armour and with jets. We’re very conscious of what he’s asking for. “At the moment, we’re looking at the equipment that we think is more immediately valuable … They need protection from that absolutely merciless onslaught from artillery.” The prime minister said at his meeting with the G7, his Japanese counterpart had spoken movingly about the use of nuclear and chemical weapons. “There is a visceral horror of the use of these weapons of mass destruction,” he said. Johnson said the US president, Joe Biden, was right to warn about the risk of a staged false flag attack. “You have to have a bit of ambiguity about your response, but I think it would be catastrophic for him if he were to do that, and I think that he understands that,” he told a press conference. “When the Russians start doing stuff about ‘there are factories in Ukraine producing American biological weapons’ you know that is a prelude to a false flag operation.” Behind the scenes, officials say there is virtually zero prospect of a military intervention. “I think very few people think that Nato entering into conflict with Russia will stop the war – it will escalate the war,” one western official said. “We are remaining deliberately ambiguous. We don’t want to say exactly how we will respond because Putin will then price that in to his calculations. We want him to remain uncertain … but we are clear there will be severe consequences.” Nato leaders agreed Ukraine required supplies of protective equipment against chemical and biological weapons, which Biden has expressed particular concern could be in the offing. But leaders agreed it was clear that any chemical attack spilling across the border into a Nato country would not be considered a direct attack on the alliance. Both the US and the UK are expected to begin supplies to Ukrainian civilians, though officials acknowledged it was difficult to know where to target supplies. “There is protective equipment which we can supply to Ukrainians such as wash-up kits and protection kits and so on,” one official aid. “That’s something we need to work through because we don’t have 44 million of these kits and clearly we don’t know where or when or how they would use such weapons.” Overnight, the prime minister said the UK would double the number of British missiles sent to Ukraine with an additional 6,000, and send an extra £25m to Ukraine’s military. During their three-hour meeting, the 30 heads of government discussed the limits of upgrading weapons supply to Ukraine, without provoking Russia further. Johnson also denied claims from Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov that he was “most active anti-Russian leader” – though privately No 10 has been delighted at the description. “I think it’s very, very important for everybody to understand that there’s not a single person around the table in Nato, or the G7 who is against Russians or the Russian people. Least of all me, the only prime minister in UK history to be called Boris. I’m not remotely anti-Russian. But I think what we all agree, is that what Vladimir Putin is doing, the way he’s leading Russia at the moment is actually catastrophic.”",News/Politics,"Chemical weapon use would be ‘catastrophic’ for Russia, says Johnson",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/24/russia-chemical-weapons-g7-nato-boris-johnson-volodymyr-zelenskiy-tanks-jets
3/25/2022,"This year’s Deutsche Börse photography prize shortlist show is, as ever, a study in dramatically contrasting approaches to the medium. On one floor of The Photographers’ Gallery, Deana Lawson’s elaborately constructed tableaux of Black experience, which draw on, and deftly subvert, studio portraiture, documentary and vernacular traditions, give way to Gilles Peress’s visceral reportage from the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The two seem worlds apart. Likewise, on a separate floor, there’s a jolting shift from the vivid colours and disorienting compositions of Anastasia Samoylova’s Miami to Jo Ractliffe’s stark South African landscapes. While traditional and contemporary strategies rub uneasily up against each other throughout, there is a kind of unity in the themes of community and belonging, struggle and self-definition. If each room is a small, self-contained exhibition designed to illuminate a much bigger body of work, it is Samoylova and Ractliffe that come off best here. The former’s work-in-progress, FloodZone, transports you to a Ballardian future world that is already unfolding in real time. Her large-scale, almost dreamlike constructions depict the hyperreal iconography of Miami’s tourism and real estate industries as it exists alongside the ominous harbingers of impending eco-disaster: flooded basements, uprooted palm trees leaning precariously against art deco facades, cracked and crumbling concrete pavements beneath vast advertisements for high-end beachfront properties. In a room painted aquamarine, the baby-doll pinkness of Miami’s walls and pavements takes on an even more sickly aspect – damp-stained, mould-covered, and in retreat from a force more inexorably powerful than capital and commerce. In contrast, Ractliffe’s space is airy and light, her monochrome photographs exuding a quietude that is immediately palpable. For me, this is the most realised exhibition here, thoughtfully conceived and deftly curated to allow these stark, haunted landscapes to speak for themselves. Ractliffe’s subject is post-apartheid, rural South Africa, which she has photographed over 40 years. Her most obvious precursor is the late David Goldblatt, but Ractliffe’s landscapes are more elusive: vast, arid flatlands pockmarked by traces of the colonial past: the scattered ruins of concrete pipelines, industrial buildings and former shantytowns. Culled from her recent monograph, Photographs 1980s – Now, it is the work that most repays close attention, her quiet observational approach characterised by subtle visual rhythms and echoes that speak of a deep and patient engagement with the land, its people and its ghosts. On the floor below, Deana Lawson’s Centropy is as ambitiously conceptual as its title suggests, her large-scale constructed portraits with mirrored frames existing somewhere between portraiture and myth, their symbolism often located within the domestic traditions of Black experience. In one striking tableau, Monetta Passing, an elderly man sits next to a dead woman who has been laid out in her finery on a semi-raised, silk-draped couch beneath gold curtains. His gaze is direct, stern and stoical. Beside him, an ornate display of flowers stand above a piece of exercise equipment – a glimpse of the functional amid the elaborate. The scale and rich colour tones combine with incidental details – her laced-gloved hands, his tattooed head – to create a scene both dramatically enhanced and, for all its artifice, authentic. Elsewhere, a family snapshot of a mother and daughter, posing casually and beaming at the camera, has been enlarged, and perhaps treated, to foreground its signs of wear and tear: surface dirt, erosion, scratches. The scale lends an ordinary, unaffected portrait an even deeper charm, but the degraded state of the print makes one’s thoughts turn inevitably to the time between then and now, and all that may have happened in between. Lawson’s ambitious images, which include holograms, always allow a lot of space for the viewer to enter in and form their own interpretations, while simultaneously holding something back. That something – embedded, complex, and elusive – is crucial in terms of the resonance these photographs possess. In his catalogue essay, pointedly titled Against Simplicity, writer and photographer Stanley Wolukau-Wanambwa writes that “Lawson’s portaits demonstrate how it is that Blackness … cannot be both accurately and simply described”. Nor interpreted. Of late, Peress has worked hard on reimagining – or repositioning – his vast archive of images from the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The work on display here, arranged floor to ceiling in unframed monochrome grids, is a mere fraction of the vast flow of images that make up his epic 2021 book Whatever You Say, Say Nothing. His aim was to create a work of “documentary fiction” that evokes the “helicoidal” nature of time in a conflict zone – days that spiral and repeat around rituals of protest, resistance, marching, violence and mourning. The most obvious way to do this in a gallery would be through multiscreen projections rather than prints – and collages – on the wall, which, in this relatively small apace, fail to evoke the ambition of the project. The images themselves, though, are visceral and often uncannily evocative of the time, the juxtaposition of the ordinary – youngsters playing, teens snogging – with the arresting – a girl sweeping broken glass from her front yard while a soldier stands a few feet away, baton in hand, behind a riot shield. Peress captures the tumult of the Troubles like few others: the walls a mad dance of imagery: sectarian graffiti, masked young people, Republican and Loyalist paraphernalia, bonfires, rioters and the deserted nocturnal streets of Belfast in a time of constant paranoia. In this context, though, the power of a single image, mounted and framed on a wall, has been lost amid the overload. As ever, it’s hard to know what criteria one would use to select a winner from such disparate artists, but, given the times we live in, and the prize’s past penchant for photography that “interrogates the medium,” the smart money’s on Lawson or Samoylova. I’d bet on the former.
