1/27/2022,"Checking-in is currently “useless” in stopping the spread of Covid-19 but QR codes can still play an important role as the nation enters a new phase of the pandemic, according to epidemiologists. Mandatory QR code check-ins remain in several settings across Australia, including in states where contact tracing efforts have been wound back in the face of rising Omicron infections.  The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, on Thursday conceded there was “not very much contract tracing going on” in the state, with the Service Victoria app now largely used to show proof of vaccination where necessary. “There might be some very limited circumstances where we would use that information for contact tracing,” he told reporters. “When you’ve got as many cases as we’ve got and you’re up against a variant that’s as wildly infectious and as easily transmitted as Omicron, we’re well beyond outbreaks, we’re well beyond contact tracing.” Asked whether there would be any changes to Victoria’s QR system, Andrews replied they were here to stay for “as long as the experts tell us they serve a purpose”. The University of South Australia epidemiologist Adrian Esterman said while there were limits to the use of QR codes for now, it was important to keep the infrastructure in place. “When you start getting into the hundreds of cases and even worse, thousands of cases, there’s no contact tracing in the world that can manage ... by the time that you get notified you’re a close contact, it’s probably a week late and you’ve already had the infection and you’ve recovered,” he told the Guardian. “It is simply not needed unless we get down to sufficiently low case numbers that contact tracers can actually use the information. Until then, QR codes are pretty useless unless they are used for entry where they check your vaccine status.” However, Esterman maintains they should continue being used in the event a new more virulent variant arises in the future. “If we say that people don’t bother to use QR codes, what happens when the next variant comes along and potentially it could be useful then?” he said. “QR codes are a bit like wearing a face mask, they should really be ubiquitous, you simply just get used to doing it.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Mike Toole from the Burnet Institute agrees. “We should keep those restrictions that have some proven effectiveness and yet don’t intrude on our lives and don’t affect the economy,” he said. “I don’t know why it’s fatiguing, it takes two seconds.” While there are reports fewer people are using QR codes than in previous months, Toole notes many people are choosing to stay at home amid the latest outbreak. The chair of epidemiology at Deakin University, Catherine Bennett, said even without contact tracing QR codes continued to serve a purpose, helping those who have tested positive to keep track of where they’ve been and who they’ve come into contact with. But she suggested governments rethink their approach. “It needs to be more discerning. With high exposure rates in the community, less is more. Concentrate on fewer sites that are more risky and really make sure we do get people using it,” she said. NSW scrapped the use of mandatory codes in mid-December other than for high-risk venues including hospitals, aged and disability care facilities, gyms, places of worship, funerals, personal services, pubs and clubs and outdoor music festivals with over 1,000 people. But as the surging case numbers saw thousands of workers furloughed in the lead up to Christmas, the government backflipped on the decision a week later, when the premier, Dominic Perrottet, announced mandatory QR codes would return along with an indoor mask mandate. The Guardian understands the original decision to scrap mandatory check-ins at lower-risk settings such as supermarkets was based on advice from NSW Health they were of little use as the state moved away from stringent contact tracing. That advice had not changed when the government reintroduced the measure.

When the NSW government announced on Tuesday that it was extending mandatory QR check-ins until 28 February, Perrottet defended their use as a measure to increase confidence. “People feel confident checking in, and our job as government is to instil confidence in our people, in the circumstances where we have a highly vaccinated population, to go out to enjoy the best that NSW has to offer in a way where you keep yourself, your friends and your family safe,” he said. Bennett said QR codes should only remain in high-risk settings such as hospitals, aged care and disability facilities as well as at venues where you are more likely to contract the virus, such as hairdressers, beauty salons and nightclubs. “They’ve got to think about what they’re trying to get out of the system. It’s not just about telling someone they might have been exposed to a case in a place where they probably had a very small chance of contracting the virus a week ago,” she said. “The worry now is that it’s all lost in the noise.”",News/Australia news,QR code check-ins ‘useless’ in Australia’s Omicron wave but experts urge for them to stay,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/27/qr-code-check-ins-useless-in-australias-omicron-wave-but-experts-urge-for-them-to-stay
1/27/2022,"Half of the targets set by the New South Wales state government to enhance residents’ quality of life are not on track to be met, despite assurances from the premier, Dominic Perrottet, that the goals “remain core” to his agenda. Education, disability representation and domestic violence are among those falling short in targets set by then premier Gladys Berejiklian following the 2019 state election. These form part of 14 “premier’s priorities” setting benchmarks for progress in key areas.  “I am a firm believer that what gets measured, gets done and I will be watching closely how we track against these new priorities,” Berejiklian said at the time. Efforts to keep women and children safe are among those areas lagging, including reducing the number of domestic violence reoffenders by 25% by 2023. Recently released data found there had instead been an increase from 1,814 reoffenders in 2015 to 1,886 in 2020. Domestic Violence NSW chief executive Delia Donovan warned lives would be lost if the trajectory was not changed. “This goal being brought back on track will save lives,” she said. “We can’t bring rates of offending down if we lack crisis accommodation options and long-term housing solutions, which continue to be a concerning issue.” She said it was critical to keep domestic violence prevention top of mind, despite the coronavirus pandemic. “Domestic violence thrives on fear and isolation,” she said. “This means frequency and severity of violence has increased during the pandemic, leaving victim-survivors further trapped and in danger.” Government data also revealed a consistent year-on-year increase in “risk of significant harm” reports for children and young people – despite the goal to see a reduction of cases by 20% by 2023. Key among the education priorities was increasing the proportion of public school students in the top two Naplan bands for literacy and numeracy by 15% of the 31.6% baseline by 2023. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The data showed results had risen just 0.8% between 2019 and 2021 – still 3.4% short of the target, which would see 36.4% achieving at the top level. Also falling short in education was the goal to see a 50% rise in the number of Indigenous students finishing year 12 with an HSC while maintaining their cultural identity. Interim results for 2020 showed a dip to 45% – far short of the 69% target for 2023. NSW Coalition of Aboriginal Peak Organisations (CAPO) co-chair Charles Lynch said it was important to recognise the impact Covid had on learning outcomes, but that it was vital to boost completion rates. “Sometimes when our kids are pushed outside the school gate, whether it be through suspensions or the disruption of Covid, they can become out of mind, out of sight,” he said. Despite the fall, Lynch was hopeful the rollout of a joint CAPO and government initiative in regional NSW would see completion rates increase in coming years. “It is about making sure those that are having those rocky times, having distractions, how do we help to get through that,” he said. “This is where we will make a big difference in closing the gap.” While the government has already exceeded its goal to bolster senior Aboriginal leaders in public sector jobs and is on track for senior women, it is far behind on its disability employment. The government wants to lift the proportion of government jobs held by people with disabilities to 5.6% by 2025, however it is sitting at just 2.5%. People with Disability Australia president Samantha Connor said there was no excuse for the dire number, at a time when there should be more flexibility than ever before. “In a time of enormous opportunity where most employers have progressed to working online it’s very sad to hear that that hasn’t happened in NSW,” she said. She wants the government to overhaul its strategy, looking at other jurisdictions that are doing better. “There is a range of measures that people can take and they’re all pretty well known,” she said. “You can’t just say ‘we have a target’ and then fail every five years. “We need to make sure that we put measures in place to make sure that people are safe during the pandemic and also that they’re able to work from home.” Goals to improve timely treatment for hundreds of thousands of people who seek treatment for imminently or potentially life-threatening conditions in emergency departments was also lagging. Perrottet said the bar had been set high “so that our actions will deliver genuine and lasting improvements”. “The priorities remain core to ensuring we’re improving outcomes, particularly for the vulnerable, and will continue to be progressed.” The premier said the areas he outlined in December – including quality of life, strong foundations, lifelong learning and homeownership – would be built upon this year. “Further announcements will be made over the coming months on reforms and initiatives the government is putting in place to make progress against these areas,” he said. NSW opposition leader Chris Minns said the government needed to refocus on the targets. “We understand there is a pandemic but Covid must not mean these important issues get put on the back burner,” he told Guardian Australia. “These are vitally important initiatives that deserve the government’s serious attention.”",News/Australia news,NSW failing to meet standards set by Gladys Berejiklian,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/27/nsw-failing-to-meet-standards-set-by-gladys-berejiklian

1/27/2022,"Aged care advocates and unions have lambasted the minister for aged care and sport, Richard Colbeck, for attending the Ashes cricket on the same day he declined to front an inquiry about the federal government’s Covid response. Advocacy group Aged Care Matters and the Health Services Union have accused Colbeck of failing to do his job and dodging accountability during the peak of the Omicron crisis.  Colbeck declined to attend the Senate Covid-19 committee on 14 January citing the need not to divert health department officials from their “urgent and critical” work. He then attended three days of the Hobart Test between Australia and England from Friday 14 to Sunday 16 January, it was revealed earlier this week. A spokesperson for Colbeck said the suggestion he had “put his sporting commitments ahead of the health and wellbeing of senior Australians … [was] completely misguided” because he had performed other Covid-related duties on that day and the Test was a day-nighter. A spokesperson for Cricket Tasmania has confirmed Colbeck attended the match following an invitation from it and Cricket Australia – although Colbeck failed to declare the source of the “sponsored travel or hospitality” he disclosed on the register of interests. Lloyd Williams, the national secretary of the Health Services Union, told Guardian Australia he was “absolutely staggered” Colbeck had gone to the cricket. He labelled it part of an “ongoing pattern of poor behaviour” including not knowing how many aged care workers have been vaccinated and not knowing the number of people who have died in aged care. “Aged workers are absolutely getting smashed, people are dying in aged care, there’s a lack of planning around the pandemic, poor surge workforce planning, and the slow rollout of boosters,” Williams said. “And the leadership of the government is off enjoying a day at the cricket instead of being accountable for the care for older Australians – it’s a disgrace and complete abrogation of responsibility and accountability. “Staff in the aged care sector are working multiple shifts, in crazy situations where they can’t get a day off. Many would’ve loved a day at the cricket but they couldn’t go because they were looking after elder Australians.” Carolyn Smith, United Workers Union national aged care director, said aged care workers are “putting themselves on the line during a pandemic, the fact Colbeck couldn’t be bothered to turn up to a committee just shows his priorities and the priorities of this government”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Sarah Russell, the director of Aged Care Matters, accused Colbeck of having shown “complete disdain for the aged care sector”. “How dare he not do his job? Someone being diligent would have fronted to answer questions but instead – he’s actually gone to the cricket. We need an aged care minister who cares about older Australians.” Russell criticised the Morrison government’s handling of aged care throughout the pandemic, including a delay in calling an inquiry into early outbreaks at Dorothy Henderson Lodge and Newmarch House, the lack of a national plan before a 7th edition of the plan was drafted, the slow vaccination rollout and poor infection control protocols. According to Aged Care Matters, on 14 January there were 1,107 aged care centres with outbreaks, rising to 1,198 on 21 January. Russell said the Omicron wave had resulted in exponential growth in infections in some aged care centres which now had hundreds of cases just weeks after having none. Rules preventing visitors to aged care had been “devastating for the mental health of residents and their families”, she said. “They’re not worried about dying of Omicron in many cases, residents are worried about dying of neglect. Staff have been devastated, and many are out on furlough. “The surge workforce has been pathetic – there haven’t been enough people in the workforce.” Colbeck’s spokesperson said on 14 January the minister had helped deal with the Omicron outbreak by meeting the head of the Covid vaccine rollout, Lt Gen John Frewen, as well as the aged care quality and safety commissioner, the acting secretary of health and the deputy chief medical officer. The spokesperson said Colbeck’s attendance at the Test was “part of his commitments as minister for sport and senator for Tasmania” and the Test was a “day/night match [that] did not start until late afternoon”. “At a time when the Australian government continues to work to protect the lives of senior Australians in care, attempts by the Senate select committee on Covid-19 to redirect resources away from the department of health for political purposes is of serious concern and should be noted by Australians as we navigate the impact of the pandemic,” the spokesperson said. On Wednesday, Labor’s shadow aged care minister, Clare O’Neil, said although dialling into meetings was important, Colbeck’s actions were not “properly commensurate with how catastrophic the situation was in aged care at that time and still is”. “At the time that Richard Colbeck was too busy going to the cricket and couldn’t appear before a Senate committee to answer questions about aged care, about 40% of aged care homes across the country were in a lockdown because of Covid,” she told ABC Radio. “The practical impact of that is that the frailest, most vulnerable people in the country are bound to their rooms. “This is a sector that … is operating at unsafe staffing levels as a matter of routine,” O’Neil said, “because there are just not enough people to provide basic assistance to elderly people who are in residential aged care.”",News/Australia news,Backlash grows over aged care minister attending Ashes cricket instead of Covid inquiry,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/27/backlash-grows-over-aged-care-minister-attending-ashes-cricket-instead-of-government-inquiry
1/27/2022,"Officials in Los Angeles have cleared a homeless encampment near SoFi stadium, where the Super Bowl will take place in three weeks, drawing backlash from human rights groups and the unhoused residents who have been displaced. On Monday and Tuesday, the state transit agency Caltrans shut down the tent community, which visitors would probably have passed on their way to the big game, calling it a “safety issue”.  But some have accused authorities of forcing people out of sight without providing housing or services. “They are just trying to survive,” said Sofi Villalpando, who works with some of the displaced residents. “It feels like [authorities] are removing people so they won’t be seen.” Dawn Toftee, 57, who was living at the encampment that was cleared, told the Guardian on Wednesday that she lost the couch she had been sleeping on during the sweep and was now sleeping on a blanket on a nearby street where she felt less safe. “Now I’m at this site where I didn’t want to be. There’s been killings and shootings around here … They should let us have our home back.” Toftee said another unhoused resident, who uses a wheelchair, had also lost the mattress he’d been sleeping on during the cleanup. She blamed the Super Bowl: “It’s terrible and it’s bullshit.” The controversial sweep comes as elected officials in LA have increasingly launched high-profile encampment shutdowns in response to a worsening humanitarian crisis. There were an estimated 48,000 people living on the streets in LA county at the start of the pandemic, the latest count. The strategy of sweeps, critics say, has prioritized aesthetics and the complaints of neighbors, leading people in established tent communities to be scattered into more dangerous living conditions. It also comes as the region is dealing with major Covid outbreaks in homeless shelters across the county, further limiting unhoused people’s options. It’s unclear how many people were affected by this week’s sweep and whether anyone received housing, shelter or other services. Michael Comeaux, a Caltrans spokesperson, directed the Guardian to the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (Lahsa), the county service provider that partnered with Caltrans for “outreach and support”. A Lahsa spokesperson said that the agency had talked to eight encampment residents on Tuesday, but he did not confirm whether any were successfully placed into housing. Comeaux said Caltrans had brought “personal belongings left behind” to a nearby maintenance yard where they would be stored for a few weeks, and that the agency had posted notices about the “cleanup” 72 hours in advance. Comeaux said that if a couch or mattress looked to be in “unusable condition”, the crew would dispose of it. Madeline deVillers, another advocate working with the residents, said Caltrans had showed up hours earlier than some residents had expected and that she had witnessed people’s belongings being thrown out. She estimated that more than two dozen people had been displaced by the sweep and said she did not personally know of anyone who received any form of housing or shelter. Most people were camping around nearby streets, she said. “There are community bonds out here – people help each other,” she said. “If I give out certain supplies, they get passed on through other people. So having this loss of community really takes a lot of resources from people … and is really hard and dangerous for these folks.” While Caltrans has said a “fire safety” concern was driving the cleanup, advocates questioned why the whole camp had to be closed. And a worker on site told the local station KTLA that the Super Bowl was the impetus for the sweep. “No one wants to take responsibility for what is happening,” said Annie Powers, an organizer with NOlympics LA, a coalition that has organized against the Olympics in 2028 in LA, partly out of concern that it will lead to these kinds of sweeps. “We see this time and time again – with sports capitalism, celebrations, or other big events like the Super Bowl or Olympics, the city tries to make the city look better for investors coming from out of town. So they’re very encouraged to try to disappear the poor from the streets.” The residents there had a wide range of experiences that led them to the streets, Villalpando said, including some whose partners had died, resulting in a loss of financial stability, and others out of work due to injuries. Some had previously been displaced from another area that went through an encampment sweep: “It’s such a broken system and I don’t feel like there is any accountability.” Toftee, the displaced resident, said she did not mind officials cleaning up the area, but that she wished they could return to the site, where she said she had been camping for roughly two years. “I am tired of being on the streets, and I don’t want to die here,” she said, noting that she had multiple unhoused friends who had died recently. A recent UCLA report estimated that 1,500 unhoused people died while living on the streets from March 2020 to July 2021. Toftee said she wished elected officials understood their experiences: “Why don’t they come and spend a day or two out here, and see what we’re going through?” “I have nowhere to go,” added Dawn Wilson, 49, another displaced resident, who said she wasn’t offered housing and was now camping on a sidewalk with her dog. “They don’t care what happens to us.” NFL spokespeople did not immediately respond to an inquiry on Wednesday afternoon.",News/US news,‘Trying to disappear the poor’: California clears homeless camp near Super Bowl,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/26/homeless-los-angeles-super-bowl
1/27/2022,"Aone-night stand, people used to say, is like a short story: if it is any good, you want it to go on for longer; if it isn’t, you could have done with 15 minutes’ more sleep. To which the retort is: sure – but a lot of people really like short stories. A lot of people, in the pre-pandemic days, used to really like one-night stands, too. The sex therapist Jenny Keane hosts a wide-ranging sex chat through her Instagram account. On it, one woman wrote appreciatively: “The sex is purely focused on pleasure. You’re not thinking about your relationship dynamics, them not doing the dishes. It’s about being served and cared for physically. It can be a very empowering and beautiful thing.”  But not any more. While it is difficult to separate the immediate pandemic effects from long-term trends, the one-night stand has been replaced by encounters that may still be casual, but aren’t total one-offs: the friendship with benefits, if you like, or the “situationship”. The National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal) is a huge-sample longitudinal study that has taken place every 10 years since 1990. In 2020, the usual face-to-face fieldwork was interrupted by Covid, but the web-based study that replaced it found a precipitous drop in the number of sexually active people reporting a new sexual partner over the previous four weeks, down by half (from 8% to 4%). Fair enough: it was the start of lockdown and no one was meant to be doing anything with anyone they didn’t live with. The researchers then divided the responses into four groups: those not in a relationship and not having sex; those not in a relationship but having sex; those in a relationship and living apart; and those in a cohabiting relationship. When they drilled down into these, they discovered patterns that would certainly have surprised and discomfited the health secretary (unless that health secretary was Matt Hancock, who has not been a model of sexual restraint). Those most likely to have had any physical contact in the four months since lockdown – most likely to have had penetrative sex, most likely to have had sex several times a week or every day, most likely to have sex toys, and most likely to report an improved sex life during the pandemic – were those in the “casual” bracket (having sex but not in a settled relationship). In sum, there has been no shortage of sexual activity among single people; there is just less churn, which is to say the pace of relationships has changed from a mayfly’s to a caterpillar’s. This has been the experience of Marie, 48, who is recently divorced. “In your 20s, you’d go into a bar and you’d lock eyes with the one you wanted a one-night stand with, and you’d go home with him,” she says. Now, however, she is having two casual “ongoing encounters”, which are “absolutely perfect”, she says. “Obviously, I’m nearly 50; I didn’t think I could do that kind of thing again.” Where does someone look if they do want a one-stand? Not in bars, apparently. “Until now, I don’t think I’d ever been out for an evening and ended up just with the people I went out with,” says Jess, 27, from Edinburgh. “Someone would know someone else from another group, the two groups would merge – that used to happen all the time. You can sleep with someone you’ve just met, knowing you don’t want to take it any further, in a way you wouldn’t with a friend.”’ “It’s very rare to get hit on in real life these days,” adds a female foot soldier in Keane’s Instagram army. “And dating apps don’t facilitate one-night stands like mums think.” We think of apps as opening up a world in which more people can connect more easily, with less risk of humiliation, which therefore results in vastly increased numbers of one-off sexual encounters. When you can make the first move on your phone and experience any rejection at one remove, what is to stop you making moves all the time? But perhaps the more important impact is that online dating has ushered in structured communication about what people actually want from sex: whether they want something long-term or no-strings. From memory, one-night stands are often rooted in pre-emptive face-saving: you don’t revisit in case the other person thinks you are more serious than they are. These minuscule considerations of pride and humiliation are obviated when everyone states their intentions in their profile. Last year, we were supposed to have a hot girl/boy summer: an explosion of promiscuity and random, meaningless, one-off sexual encounters. But not everyone thought this was likely. “Everyone in the sex toy industry, when people were talking about the summer of love, was going: ‘No, that’s not what’s going to happen,’” says Julia Margo. She is one of the founders of Hot Octopuss, a high-end sex toy company. “If you’re making sex toys, you have to understand how people are using them and how they’re having sex, because that determines what people are going to buy,” she says. At the start of the pandemic, “you could trace the spread of lockdowns by buying behaviours across the world. Once the US went into lockdown, we saw crazy sales, and those were mainly masturbatory aids.” This was in 2020; as we moved into summer, people started buying couples’ toys, then, as we entered 2021, people tended towards the interactive; things you could control by an app and use with a partner long-distance. People were trying hard to keep intimacy alive, in the face of hopelessly insurmountable barriers. “It was similar to what you saw with comms platforms at work: first people set up their home offices, then it was Zoom,” she says. Many people experienced devastating losses during Covid, while those who didn’t had a pressing and unfamiliar awareness of mortality. While the sex toy industry focused on what this meant for physical intimacy, it meant a lot emotionally, too. A carpe diem approach to love is not yet visible in marriage statistics, which lag restrictions and are hard to read, not least because lots of couples who wanted to wed before the pandemic still haven’t had a chance to rebook. However, the ground is thick with anecdotes. As the actor Riz Ahmed said in a recent interview, he got married with this in mind: “Work out what matters to you, stand by it and just don’t fuck about. Get on with it!” A joint survey by the counselling charity Relate and the dating site eHarmony identified the “turbo relationship”; one piquant response was that, during lockdown, “two months felt more like two years of commitment”. Lockdown rules acted as an accelerant, forcing a choice between never seeing each other and moving in together. All this added up to fewer people on the one-night-stand market, whether or not it had been temporarily shut down. As we have been forced into greater intimacy, we have become more open to new experiences. “Unquestionably, people have become more experimental in their interests, forming more couple partnerships [exclusive relationships] and becoming more adventurous within that partnership,” says Margo. A lot of people describe sex in one-night stands as “vanilla”; it is hard to ask for anything out of the ordinary with someone you don’t yet know or trust. There is a theory that a decline in random sexual encounters might indicate a new age of inhibition or sexual moralising, but it looks as if the opposite is true. It could be precisely because people are less inhibited that, even if they don’t want a traditional, monogamous relationship, they want the intimacy and depth it takes to experiment. “You used to be able to categorise people. I could say: this is a BDSM-type person – they’re going to go to a specialist site,” Margo says. She would never have thought of stocking up on stocking gags and dog leads, she says. “To me, these were really niche products. But they are so popular – and it’s the same people who are buying normal vibrators.” Before Covid, it would have been unusual for 55-plus consumers to buy BDSM sex furniture, she says. “But there’s huge experimenting in this age bracket – and they’re spending real money on their sex lives.” For people who have been sexually active during the pandemic, there has been a constellation of effects. Many have had more time to explore latent desires. Sex has offered comfort amid external anxieties. There has been more loaded on to sex lives as other social identities have been pared down. Ultimately, if physical contact is going to be fraught with danger, sex needs to be good. You don’t want to waste it on a one-night stand, which is to libido as a pasty at a service-station is to appetite. Yet, according to the latest Natsal study, one-quarter of people haven’t been sexually active at all in the past two years. They are part of what is driving down the number of one-night stands. The Relate/eHarmony survey found that 39% of single people emerged from the pandemic looking to meet “the one”, while 24% did not want “to waste any more time”. Counterbalancing that determination and certainty, though, was a sense of insecurity, with 25% feeling “out of practice” and 13% “not ready to be intimate” after so many months of social distancing. Even while this skews slightly towards women in the survey, men also describe a sense of trepidation, self-doubt and futility. Andrew, 55, was newly divorced at the start of lockdown and hasn’t had sex since. “I don’t think I am attractive,” he says, matter-of-factly. “I weigh too much. Someone would look at me and think: ‘Oh no. He’s a fatty.’ It’s mainly in my own head, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t real.” Will Nutland, a researcher at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and a co-founder of the not-for-profit sexual health organisation The Love Tank, has observations from STI rates and clinic referrals that echo Margo’s. “The expectation that we’d all say: ‘Let’s pull our knickers off and throw them in the air and shag anyone around us’ – that’s not happening and was probably never going to happen,” he says. He points out that a number of opportunities simply didn’t arise during lockdown. Large events – the best hunting ground for one-night stands – have been the first things to close down and the last things to restart. Festivals were poleaxed by last year’s poor weather, while freshers’ week was conducted remotely in 2020. But by 2021, something else had happened: “People of all generations were scared about getting too close to other people,” Nutland says. “They’re not necessarily scared of Covid; they’ve just forgotten how to be intimate. We’ve lost some of those social skills and some of those sexual skills.” Without casual social intimacy, there is less impetus to initiate physical intimacy; we lose our body confidence, which makes us more withdrawn. Also, no one has had to question or confront their new hermit habits, because Covid looms over everything, receding for a while and then returning with a vengeance. The predicament of sexually inactive people is fascinating: have they been living under such harsh restrictions, and in such solitude, that they have started to internalise the rules to create a profound sexual inhibition? Or has the virus provided cover for a level of asexuality that was previously taboo? But these questions don’t tally with the behaviours of sexually active people, which have changed, but not necessarily for the worse: just as much sex, fewer partners, more experimentation. It is unsurprising when you consider the external context – more time in the private sphere, a new and pressing awareness of mortality, far fewer chance encounters with strangers. “It all makes sense – except a lot of these scenes, this experimentation, it all takes time,” says Margo. “It’s not a Wednesday date night thing you can do after the kids are in bed. Maybe that’s why we mainly saw it in the 40-pluses and under-30s.” In other words, parents of young kids are the ones we should be worrying about. If, for others, one-night stands have turned into 15-night stands, the post-pandemic reality may be more sexual fulfilment.

1/27/2022,"Jeremy King is a devotee of the dice. The restaurateur behind the Wolseley and the Delaunay gave up his place at Cambridge University in the 1970s on a throw of the dice after reading George Cockcroft’s cult novel The Dice Man. “It was something I did casually about deciding where I should go for dinner,” King said in a speech about his career last year. “[But] then I ended up throwing the dice on my life.”  When the envelope from Cambridge dropped through the letterbox of the family home in Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, he threw the dice. The throw said: “If you become a manager within a month of your 21st birthday then you will stay in this business for the rest of your life.” He had part-time job at Charco’s wine bar, a celebrity haunt off Kings Road in Chelsea. Within a month of his 21st birthday he was appointed the manager. The dice kept calling, though, sending him off to become a merchant banker. His careers adviser at school had told him he would make a “a really brilliant accountant”. But in reality he found it terribly boring and described working in the City as “hell”. Then it was back to restaurants, this time at New York-style brasserie Joe Allen in Covent Garden. After work he would hang out at Langan’s Brasserie where he struck up a firm friendship with then general manager Chris Corbin. The pair, then 26 and 28, decided they should open their own restaurant. Within a year they had taken over Le Caprice in 1981, but almost immediately fell out with their financial backers as they couldn’t agree how to run a modern restaurant. King persuaded his mum and dad to back him instead. “My parents mortgaged their house and we bought the lease. We were young with 100% control. No one could tell us what to do,” he said. Over the past 40 years Corbin and King have been described as “near deities on the London restaurant scene”, the “Rodgers and Hammerstein of relaxed eating” and “the Rolls and Royce of London gastronomy”. But now their Corbin & King empire – which includes the Wolseley next to the Ritz on Piccadilly, Delaunay on Aldwych, Brasserie Zédel by Piccadilly Circus, Bellanger in Islington and The Beaumont in Mayfair – is under fire from American-born Thai billionaire William Heinecke. Heinecke’s Minor International hospitality investment fund bought a 74% stake in Corbin & King for £58m in 2017 and on Tuesday forced the company into administration warning it was “unable to meet its financial obligations” and claiming King, who serves as Corbin & King’s chief executive, had repeatedly rejected “proposals to recapitalise the company”. King accuses Heinecke of making a “power play” for full control of the company, and said that post-lockdown the restaurants were “trading extremely well” and there was “absolutely no need to go into administration”. Quoting 18th-century Soho poet William Blake to the Financial Times, he said: “A truth that is told with bad intent beats all the lies you can invent.” While he has mostly worked running restaurants, King has always considered himself a literary man and has admitted to “secretly wishing I had been in the theatre”. “But of course restaurateuring is, in a funny way, theatre,” he told the Association of Jewish Refugees in a speech last year (King isn’t Jewish, but his children from his first marriage to theatre producer-turned therapist Debra Hauer are.) “You learn your lines, you practise, you rehearse and then suddenly it’s makeup, costumes and the curtain’s up and you’re performing.” Contrary to expectations, King says “deep down I am an extremely shy person” but he is transformed “in the context of a restaurant’s stage”. King’s Rolodex must rate as one of London’s most extensive, as his restaurants have been – and still are – popular with both FTSE 100 chief executives having power breakfasts as well as members of royalty and celebrities enjoying themselves. He describes one night at Le Caprice in the 1980s when Norma Heyman, the producer of films including Dangerous Liaisons, came in requesting a table for eight without a reservation. “Suddenly the table [at which] Laurence Olivier was celebrating his birthday at got up earlier than expected, thank God,” he told the Jewish refugee association. “Then I saw flashlights … and Liz Taylor promptly sat down on the same seat that Olivier had just vacated”. Princess Diana was a regular at Le Caprice in the 1980s, always sitting at the most coveted “table nine”. The same table at which Jeffrey Archer – who named checked Le Caprice in his fateful 1986 alibi – ate his first meal after being freed from jail for perjury. Madonna famously ate sticky toffee pudding with Harold Pinter and Tom Cruise at the Ivy, while the Beckhams prefer the Delaunay. Lucian Freud dined at the Wolseley most nights up until his death in 2011. King sat for Freud, becoming one of the artist’s last subjects. King also owns a Freud, which sits alongside an Andy Warhol print of Goethe in the main living room of his five-storey Grade II-listed Belgravia home. Also in his collection are works by Damien Hirst and Robert Longo. His second wife, American interior designer Lauren Gurvich King, says King’s love of art “stems from curating and collecting works for the original Ivy, which helped with the careers of many YBAs”. The Angel of the North sculptor Antony Gormley, a friend of King’s who made an “inhabitable sculpture” for the Beaumont Hotel, said: “They [Corbin & King] have always understood art as an integral part of the way an environment makes you feel. Their restaurants have never been just about food but the curating of an experience.” The Hauer-King children have inherited their parents’ love of the arts.

1/27/2022,"Ahundred years ago, on 27 January 1922, a major snowstorm hit the region around Washington DC, depositing more than 71cm (28 inches) of snow. This was an unusually heavy fall, and tragedy was to follow. The Knickerbocker theatre had a full house of 900 people for a new silent movie, Get-Rich-Quick Wallingford. One of the newest and largest cinemas in the city, the Knickerbocker had an unusual flat roof.  At 9pm, the movie commenced. Then, without warning, with no cracking or creaking, the roof gave way under the weight of snow. It collapsed and brought down the balcony inside the theatre. Hundreds of soldiers assisted in recovering victims from the rubble. Ninety-eight people were crushed to death and many more injured, including a violinist in the orchestra whose arm had to be amputated. Movie theatres in the capital were shut down for inspection and building codes quickly updated with a requirement for steel beams to support flat roofs. The construction of the Knickerbocker was flawed, and both the architect and the building’s owner later killed themselves. However, litigation failed and neither the victims nor their families ever received compensation. The storm later became known as the Knickerbocker snowstorm, and any heavy snowfall in Washington triggered speculation about another building collapse.

1/27/2022,"The tortured lives of comedians form a biographical genre all of their own; there’s always an audience for the tears of a clown. No wonder Nick Newman and Ian Hislop chose Spike Milligan as the subject of their new play. Milligan, who died 20 years ago next month, is the troubled comedy genius to end them all. Shellshocked in the second world war, repeatedly admitted to hospital for mental ill health, subjected to electroconvulsive therapy, and increasingly embittered as his career failed to deliver on early promise – the Spike Milligan sad-clown drama writes itself. “But we didn’t want to do that,” says Newman. “We wanted to ask: how did he come to create these brilliant things?” Their play – a cheerful act of ancestor-worship by by Private Eye’s editor and its eminent cartoonist – is about the first three years (1951-54) of The Goon Show, as its chief writer Milligan battles the BBC to get his vision on air. “It’s: will he survive the fallout from the war?,” says Newman, “and will he crack radio?” And, “spoiler alert!,” chimes in Hislop. “Milligan wins! We just wanted to have a play where he wins.”  Spike sustains a rich collaboration between the duo and the Watermill theatre in Berkshire, which produced their 2016 first world war play The Wipers Times, about a satirical newspaper published in the Flanders trenches. Talking at the venue while their play rehearses next door, Newman classifies Spike as “a sort of sequel” to the earlier play – because, they argue, Milligan’s comic sensibility sprang from his wartime experiences. “When you think of the Goons,” says Hislop, “you think: how many jokes about the Naafi are there, how many reruns of war films, how many explosions and references to [fictional military stuffed-shirt] Major Bloodnok? It’s riddled with it. It’s their wartime experiences put into joke form” – and abstracted into wild sound effects, silly voices and surrealism, too. (“Shellshock on radio,” some called it.) But the BBC didn’t welcome “their finest hour” being held up to ridicule – nor Milligan’s anti-establishment airs in general. After the Goons’ coronation special, when Peter Sellers – horror of horrors! – impersonated Churchill and the Queen, “about 30 BBC managers demanded Spike be sacked for this appalling attack on the monarchy”. That is the conflict the play dramatises: anarchy versus deference, the 60s satire boom in embryo. “What the Goons did,” says Hislop, “was channel the khaki election” that swept the 1945 Labour government to power. But it didn’t happen, at least for Spike, without a fight. “He moved from a world where people were saying: ‘Get on with it, Milligan, and stop messing about’,” says Hislop, “to another world where people said exactly the same thing.” And so, Newman joins in, “he basically carried on fighting the war, but this time against the BBC.” The play was first conceived for televison, commissioned by that same BBC to mark the 2018 centenary of Milligan’s birth. The corporation made available an archive of internal memos relating to the Goons, and all Milligan’s correspondence with the broadcaster. As many published volumes have revealed, Spike’s letters were often hilarious. But they also disclose the strain on his mental health of producing so many episodes, and the everyday peevishness of his relationship with the BBC. “You might think ‘I wonder what amazing things Spike wrote to the BBC?,’” says Hislop. “But it’s always: ‘Why haven’t I got a repeat on a Sunday? And: ‘No one listens to us in this slot!’ But that is what drives humans, and he was as human as the rest of us.” Both Hislop and Newman can identify with Milligan’s experiences smuggling hot-potato material on air. Long before Hislop’s Have I Got News for You gig, the pair worked on ITV’s Spitting Image in the 1980s, where Hislop remembers “one election night watching the entire ITV management hugging themselves at their own bravery for broadcasting this programme – a programme that all along they’d been trying to take off the air!” He also recalls, as a rookie journalist, interviewing Milligan on Radio 4’s Midweek. “In those days, there was a bottle of champagne for the guest. I opened the bottle for Spike, very badly, and it went all over my notes. Which I’d written in felt pen.” “Spike, who hadn’t wanted to be interviewed, suddenly warmed up and thought this was the funniest thing ever. It was anarchy, I had no questions – and so he started asking himself questions, far better than the ones I’d planned.” With their play, the pair want to introduce this wild comic sensibility to a new generation – stung by the fact that “my kids didn’t know who Spike was”, as Newman says. “Nor mine,” says Hislop. “Not a clue.” “For a younger generation,” he goes on, “we wanted to banish the image of some very old men, one of whom was on Songs of Praise [Harry Secombe], and another who made really terrible films [Sellers].” They’re less interested, too, in the other side of Spike’s reputation – as a misanthrope, and an artist whose work (including the racist sitcom Curry and Chips) has not always worn well. Instead, Spike tells the story of a moment in time, when the artist’s creativity, his trauma and the spirit of the age came together and made sparks. “Spike wrote 250 episodes of The Goon Show in a 10-year period,” says Newman. “In every series, there are many, many references to the war. Pretty much after that, he stops – and in his later work, hardly mentions it again.” “Can we recreate a period,” asks Hislop, “when these people were incredibly young, fresh out of the army, all working-class, all come up through the ranks? Can we depict this show that started off with lots of people harrumphing, and within a couple of years had audiences that television would now die for? Who thought this was the funniest programme there has ever been?” He beams. “It feels like an amazing thing to try and reignite.” Michael PalinIt was such a liberating discovery to listen to The Goon Show. I was about 10 when a friend told me about the show. And once I listened, I was hooked. It was so unlike the rest of comedy at the time. There were no roots to what Spike did: it just took off, and went anywhere. In a half hour, he could be all over the place: that was the thrill. And as well as this wonderful, imaginative comedy, you got to hear all the chuckles, things going wrong and performers having a great time. That was new, at a time when broadcasting was very respectable. There was no one like Spike, really. No one wrote in quite the same way. And what he did gave me a sense of what I could do. I’d think: what I’m writing may be a bit odd, but it’s not nearly as odd as what I’m hearing here! Paul MertonThere was a short-lived show called the Telegoons, in the early 60s. It had puppets performing to recorded editions of the radio show. That was my introduction to Milligan, and I was immediately struck by the surreal humour and the strangeness. He was a huge influence on me and seeing him on a chatshow was always funny. I remember one where he said “Now let me demonstrate a cheap but noisy way to travel” – then he just walked across the stage screaming his head off. When he didn’t have to worry about costume changes or rehearsal time, and just let himself be spontaneous, he was extraordinary. AL KennedyI first encountered him when I was just four or five. He occupied this space that children could understand as well as adults. He was the kid at the side of the road going “yeah, but he’s not wearing any clothes!” But you could tell when he was having an off-day: he could get angry. And part of what upset him was that his productivity was horrific. When I actually looked at his output – Jesus, that would crush you! You have to write an episode of the Goons every week! It’s just: “be good at being funny, every week, any way you want. Three hundred and sixty degrees of possibility.” That would break most people. But if you can do it, and Milligan could, it’s magnificent. Eddie IzzardIt was 1974, my dad was working for BP in Abu Dhabi, and he used to record the Goons on Radio Dubai and send it back to us. John Cleese once talked about how each episode was broadcast twice, and he would listen to the second one with the radio to one ear and a pillow to the other, to hear any jokes he had missed. I totally identified with that. Spike’s creativity was beautiful. All these weird sound effects of chickens and motor engines. He was the godfather of alternative comedy. His timing was perfect and his imagination was limitless. I absolutely recommend young comedians listen to as much of Spike’s stuff as they can. Spike is at the Watermill Theatre, Newbury, 27 January until 5 March.",Arts/Stage,"‘The godfather of alternative comedy’: Eddie Izzard, Paul Merton and more on Spike Milligan",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/27/godfather-alternative-comedy-eddie-izzard-paul-merton-ian-hislop-spike-milligan
1/27/2022,"Nature lovers will be able to enjoy the high-speed flight of the chequered skipper butterfly in an English woodland for the first time in more than 45 years this summer. Such is the success of a four-year reintroduction programme to return the rare insect to the woods of Northamptonshire, where it fell extinct in 1977, that its secret site can be revealed to the public.  The exact location of the butterflies was previously a closely guarded secret to protect fragile populations, but the charity Butterfly Conservation, which leads the project, has now announced that the public will be able to see the butterfly in Forestry England’s Fineshade Wood. Last year 65 were spotted in the woods, after adult butterflies were brought from Belgium in 2018 and 2019. The English offspring have successfully bred for several years and have increased their range by 20 hectares, with the wider woodland being carefully managed to create the sunny ridges and glades that the species requires. Dr Dan Hoare, the director of conservation for Butterfly Conservation, said: “We have had to keep the exact location of these butterflies secret for the first few years following their introduction to allow them time to get established. While our work to secure the future of this population of chequered skipper continues, we are delighted to be able to reveal their location so that butterfly enthusiasts can come and enjoy spotting them in the wild in England for the first time in more than 40 years.” While the chequered skipper is flourishing again thanks to the Back from the Brink project, Susannah O’Riordan, the chequered skipper project manager for Butterfly Conservation, said they hoped the butterfly would expand further across its traditional stronghold of Rockingham Forest in Northamptonshire. The chequered skipper’s only other British population is in the Highlands of Scotland. “It’s always a work in progress and we’ve still got to maintain the population size,” said O’Riordan. “They are such a difficult butterfly to monitor because they are so fast, and sneaky about where they are. We’re definitely only seeing a proportion of the population on site.” The butterfly typically emerges at the end of May and visitors to Fineshade Wood will be supervised by two “skipper rangers” as well as Butterfly Conservation volunteers and Forestry England staff. Visitors are being urged to stick to marked footpaths and not trample long grass, which the butterfly’s caterpillars feed on. “It can be a problem if people aren’t respectful of their habitat,” said O’Riordan. “But we’ve been doing a lot of management in nearby woodland and we hope as numbers increase that the butterfly will colonise some of the additional woodlands in the area. That’s always been our aim through the project – to create lots of habitat for the chequered skipper to colonise naturally. There’s a lot more open habitat and sunny spaces for the butterfly to expand into.”",News/Environment,Secret site of chequered skipper butterfly’s English revival revealed,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/27/secret-site-of-chequered-skipper-butterfly-revival-revealed-northamptonshire
1/27/2022,"If Boris Johnson’s premiership is brought to a humiliating close in the coming days, it will not only be because he allowed Downing Street’s boozy lockdown parties to happen on his watch – but because he lied about them. When allegations of parties first emerged, Johnson told MPs in the House of Commons that Covid guidance “was followed completely in No 10”, and on another occasion – vehemently – that he had been “repeatedly assured” there were no parties.  Both of those assertions now seem increasingly hard to believe, as has been evident in Johnson supporters’ tortuous efforts to defend him. Slavish loyalist Conor Burns plumbed new depths of absurdity this week by saying the prime minister was “ambushed by a cake”. On Wednesday Labour claimed there was further evidence of lies when newly released Foreign Office emails appeared to contradict Downing Street’s insistence that Johnson did not personally authorise the controversial rescue of cats and dogs from a British animal charity in Afghanistan. Even those cabinet ministers who have backed him in recent days have stressed the sanctity of the ministerial code, which says bluntly that “ministers who knowingly mislead parliament will be expected to offer their resignation”. Citing that rule on Wednesday, Labour leader Keir Starmer called on Johnson to resign immediately. But judging by the prime minister’s half-apology for attending the “bring your own booze” party in May 2020, which he insisted he believed was a “work event”, he appears likely to argue that if he did mislead parliament, he did so unwittingly. Amber Rudd resigned as home secretary in 2018 when she discovered she had “inadvertently misled” the home affairs select committee but Johnson appears unlikely to take the same approach. His allies have insisted he will fight any vote of no confidence. Those who have worked closely with Johnson over the years say fibbing is an entrenched part of his psychological makeup – and his political toolkit. His first instinct, when backed into a political corner, is to tell a wilful untruth, they say. Indeed, they suggest that, over time, Johnson comes to believe the version of reality he weaves for himself as he fibs his way out of trouble. “It’s almost a superpower in a way,” one former colleague said with something approaching awe. He has twice been sacked in the past for lying. In 1988, the Times got rid of him after he made up quotes in a news story. He later conceded that he had “mildly sandpapered something somebody said”. As an MP in 2004, he was dispatched from the Tory frontbench, not for having an affair but for failing to come clean about it. He had described the claims of a long-running relationship with Spectator colleague Petronella Wyatt as “complete balderdash”. During the 2019 Tory leadership contest, Conservative MPs who compared notes afterwards found he had made completely contradictory promises to them about what stance he would take on particular policies. None of that appeared to matter too much when the odd fib was part of the devil-may-care persona his own MPs believed made Johnson the “Heineken politician”, reaching groups of voters the Tories had previously struggled to win over. And it was of a piece with the ruthless approach he and his band of Vote Leave veterans took to bulldozing Brexit through – even when that meant proroguing parliament, or taking the whip away from senior and long-serving MPs. Little more than two years after Johnson secured a thumping parliamentary majority and did indeed “get Brexit done”, he may be felled by the very maverick qualities that helped him into Downing Street – not least his seeming inability to stick to the truth.",News/Politics,Fibbing is part of Boris Johnson’s toolkit but could be his undoing,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/27/fibbing-is-part-of-boris-johnsons-toolkit-but-could-be-his-undoing

With investors also concerned about political tensions between Russia and Ukraine, supply chain problems and rising oil prices, the prospect of sustained increases in the cost of borrowing by the world’s most powerful economy sent a spasm of anxiety through financial markets on Thursday.  The Nikkei in Japan led the way as it plunged more than 3% while the Kospi in Seoul found itself in similarly negative territory. The market in Hong Kong was off 2.5% and Sydney shed nearly 2%.

The FTSE100 is set to fall nearly 2% when it opens on Thursday morning, according to futures trade, with the Wall Street markets also heading for a hefty loss. Mike Kelly, head of global multi-asset at PineBridge Investments in the US, said it was a sign to “get the heck out” of US stocks. “It’s all about selling longer duration assets,” he said, “so we are underexposed to US equities.” In its latest policy update on Wednesday, the US Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, indicated the central bank was likely to raise interest rates in March, and reaffirmed plans to end its Covid-emergency bond purchases that month before launching a significant reduction in its asset holdings. US Futures, kinda getting used to red. $TSLA, $QQQ, $SPY pic.twitter.com/4bNe2FbpZR But in the follow-up press conference, Powell warned that inflation – which has hit levels not seen for decades – remains above the Fed’s long-run goal and supply chain issues may be more persistent than previously thought. “There was a marked shift in terms of a relatively dovish statement and then a relatively hawkish press conference,” said David Chao, global market strategist, Asia Pacific at Invesco. “Powell is not committing to the size or the frequency of rate hikes and also the timing of the balance sheet reduction. I think that buys him a bit of wriggle room as to how quickly and with what velocity he wants to normalise monetary policy in the US.” Chao said, however, that any further rise in inflation in the US, which is now running at 7%, could lead to “a more aggressive monetary policy tightening” meaning more US rate hikes.

1/27/2022,"If the roof had been on Rod Laver Arena it would have blown off as a zealous home crowd roared Nick Kyrgios and Thanasi Kokkinakis into an unlikely Australian Open doubles final. Laver himself was in the house on Thursday afternoon to watch the unseeded pair, who have both shocked and awed their competition and the public, storm past Marcel Granollers of Spain and Horacio Zeballos of Argentina 7-6(7-4), 6-4.  They will face Matt Ebden and Max Purcell in Saturday’s final – the first all-Australian men’s doubles decider since 1980 – after Ebden and Purcell beat second seeds Rajeev Ram (America) and Joe Salisbury (Britain) 6-3, 7-6(11-9). “I have played a lot of singles matches around the globe with amazing atmospheres,” Kyrgios said afterwards. “But this week with Thanasi playing in front of you, nothing beats this. This is insane.” The spectators came in higher numbers than their previous matches at Kia Arena after Tennis Australia let ground pass holders through the gates of centre court. But those in attendance witnessed less showboating and skulduggery than they might have expected. Before there was a sense Kyrgios and Kokkinakis were playing mainly to entertain, now they were also playing to win. And win they did, despite a tight first set that stayed on serve all the way to a tie-break. Their opponents, both about decade the Australians’ seniors, moved in tandem with a smoothness expected of the third seeds and last year’s Wimbledon runners-up, and Granollers targeted Kyrgios at the net. The Australians continued unabated, serving aces (13 all up) and sending down 32 winners to 21. They included a Kokkinakis backhand winner down the line and a big Kyrgios second serve of 198km/h to help them to 5-5. It was until 6-5 that Granollers and Zeballos won more than a single point on the Australians’ serve but Kokkinakos, who received a time violation warning, served an ace en route to setting up a tie-break. Cue the start of the Kyrgios verbals. “Can you be quiet while I serve you numbnut,” Kyrgios barked back to one spectator who yelled something out before jagging an early mini-break. Kyrgios utilised a short backswing on more than one occasion to counter Zeballos’s serve and, by the time they raced to a 5-2 lead, were effectively unassailable. They returned for the second set riding the same momentum and won seven consecutive points to take the opening game and a crucial early break point. Granollers and Zeballos clawed back to deuce but could not stop Kokkinakis, who was freed up for a deft forehand winner. Things were apparently going to plan – until Kyrgios began to betray signs of pressure. Up 4-2 but down 15-40, the 26-year-old gave the chair umpire some lip and then served a fault, before pumping a high-velocity second serve and then following it up with such composure it could not be answered. In the very next point he set up Kokkinakis for a winner and he duly obliged. Still, there was tension with the crowd, and again Kyrgios made his feelings known. After going down a break point, the umpire asked the crowd to remain quiet between serves. It was not enough. Granollers and Zeballos broke back, and Kyrgios’s racket lay smashed on the court. He was given a warning and went to the change of ends mouthing off. “Again, and again, and again,” he said in reference to spectators calling out before serves, “and still you say nothing.” Kokkinakos was a picture of calm amid the mayhem around him, but so were the players up the other end, and their superior experience came to the fore to level at 4-4. Kokkinakis, unflappable, got his team out of trouble on serve to lead 5-4 and receive for the match. “I think both of us bring something different, different energy, different sort of charisma on the court,” Kokkinakis said. “But we just enjoy it and we have fun and that shows, and that is why hopefully you guys watch us. But I think we are unpredictable and that is why they enjoy it.” Kyrgios said they would not take Ebden and Purcell lightly in Saturday night’s meeting, again on Rod Laver Arena, following the women’s singles final which will potentially feature another Australian, Ash Barty. “They are obviously playing some good tennis, it is the final,” he said. “I am looking forward to it and is great to see Aussies having success – and obviously Ash on the women’s side is doing her thing – I am just looking forward to it.”",Sport/Sport,High-octane Nick Kyrgios and Thanasi Kokkinakis storm into Australian Open final,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/27/high-octane-nick-kyrgios-and-thanasi-kokkinakis-storm-into-australian-open-final

They lift above the kiosk roof, above the dog and the sign that says No Dogs, above parked cars, trees and lawns down to the sea startled by its own light. How many times a day do the pigeons do this? Disguised in their pigeon-ness, cooing, pecking at invisible stuff, they’re only waiting for a clap to make the thunder. How do they decide who goes first? This one, that one, all.  The sudden reclamation of their ancestral rock-dovery rises before Regency-windowed cliffs of the seafront – savage little shadows in a polite breeze. Caught in the act, at shutter speed, their grey-on-blue silhouettes are like joyfully cast underwear. What is it to be wound so tight that the slightest quiver scares you into the sky? Danger wears feathers, too. Death flies a falcon, drives a van, monitors through the beady eyes of gulls, who stand aloof on chimney pots in winter quiet. A couple of jays (Leonard and Kenneth, apparently) in their pieds, pinks and blues, attend to street elms. People, lifted by class A sunshine, keep their little familiars on leads. What is it to see as a pigeon sees? Unlike the three-cone types of our retinas, pigeons have four – red, green, blue and ultraviolet; some cones contain coloured oil droplets allowing them to see even more colours than we can. What is it to feign panic but never touch, only smack wings together above and below the body on takeoff; clapping the moment, not the cause of the moment; clapping not being dead but deft. To speed through lanes of air, around buildings and trees, more dance than flight. To map which way is up and down, north and south, prospect and refuge, home. To have all that data spooling around the mind as feathers fly in and out of jeopardy. To wear a memory, coded in the iridescence around their necks, of a lost world of wild coasts hidden under the pavement, never found because every time they search for it, there’s a sudden move and they’re airborne again.
