1/5/2022,"He is a mysterious, up-and-coming artist whose work has been championed by the likes of Madonna and sells for up to five figures. But there were raised eyebrows when it was revealed that “Rhed” was none other than the singer’s eldest son, Rocco Ritchie.  The 21-year-old, Madonna’s child with her ex-husband Guy Ritchie, has been said in reports to have quietly established himself as an expressionist painter, with a number of shows at the Tanya Baxter Contemporary gallery in Chelsea, west London, since 2018. But since PageSix unmasked Ritchie, opinion has been divided on whether his success is due to talent or the weight of his parents’ names. That Ritchie is Rhed is hard to argue with. Both are the same age, grew up in identical cities, and attended Central Saint Martins and the Royal Drawing School. In 2020, Madonna and Guy Ritchie even reunited at the Tanya Baxter Contemporary, alongside their partners and children, for a then unnamed exhibition. So what do we know of his work? Rhed uses thickly applied oils and gestural brushstrokes for his depictions of the human form, according to Tanya Baxter, the gallery’s curator. His inspirations include Lucian Freud, Francis Bacon, Paula Rego and Helmut Newton. While his subjects have “psychological tension”, he balances this by using a colourful palette and “playfully painting looming figures in the middle of the canvas, often set against a monochromatic abstract backdrop”, Baxter says. “Having an eclectic cultural background, with a childhood spent between New York and London, his paintings exude an engaging mixture of innocence and confidence,” she adds. Rhed himself has said he is “fascinated about the inner and outer world, especially where they meet”. The message of his paintings is that there is “beauty in the struggle of life” – more beauty, he is quoted as saying, than when life comes easy. The King’s Road gallery, which has likened Rhed’s work to Jean-Michel Basquiat and Banksy, promotes a number of positive reviews, including from Mervyn Davies, a former chair of the Royal Academy. “Good artists are those that turn energy into something beautiful that resonates with the eye,” Davies says. “Anyone can be a painter, but it is a question of making others think, and provoke feelings.” The arts writer Godfrey Barker called Rhed “an authentic, pure, and undiluted product of the 21st century … Rhed is not yet to be ranked with the Golden Youth who shook the world at Frieze in 1988. But he is to be mentioned in their company. He makes a powerful statement about Anxiety Now and points into the future.” The Guardian art critic Jonathan Jones was less enthusiastic, suggesting the artist had been put into the public eye too soon. “His paintings are clumsy adolescent efforts with no sign of originality or vigour,” Jones said. “Obviously that doesn’t mean he will not become a better artist with time. Painting takes work. It therefore seems a shame that Rhed has been put into the public eye when he’s just not, at this point, a real artist. These daubs are amateur stuff, vaguely imitating Picasso or Modigliani, that could have been done by a million young people.” The gallery, Jones added, “ought to be ashamed of cynically pushing this unready youngster on the market. They compare him with the street artists Banksy and Basquiat but to be honest, the only street they remind me of is the King’s Road where this kind of bad art is sure to sell to posh fools.” Rhed’s pieces are listed on Artsy for up to £24,000. Whether or not the world should have allowed Ritchie to continue using a fake name is yet to be determined.

1/5/2022,"One often overlooked aspect of the current pandemic is the effect that it has had on brands. The poor brands, who long ago settled on a cool-sounding name only to have it coopted by a deadly once-a-century health crisis. Remember Corona, the beer that people used to drink before the association with illness and death became too much to take? Remember Delta, the airline that people used to use before it reminded everyone that new Covid mutations are destined to consign humanity to a quivering wreck for decades to come? These are the real victims. Until now, the Omicron variant has escaped such a fate. This is because Omicron is such a stupid word that the only people who had ever adopted it as a name are an imposing German electrical diagnostic corporation and a Belgian death metal band, and neither one seems particularly bothered by the association.  However, if you squint hard enough and pretend that you don’t know how to read, the word “Omicron” sort of looks a bit like ‘Omarion’. And that’s bad news for the R&B singer of the same name who was once part of the band B2K. Because, for almost a full month now, Omarion has found himself on the receiving end of Twitter’s firehose. For a whole swathe of people online, Omicron is now “the Omarion variant”. If you catch it by surprise, you tweet a gif of Omarion on The Masked Singer. If you want to show how the virus spreads, you tweet a video of Omarion dancing through the streets after a woman. If you’re forced into self-isolation, you make a TikTok of Omarion dancing on the end of a lateral flow swab like an especially perky bogey. This article includes content provided by TikTok. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'. Through the thick of the outbreak, Omarion himself has apparently remained oblivious to this association. However, he has finally issued an official response. On New Year’s Day, Omarion uploaded three TikTok videos to help clear up any misunderstanding. “Hi, this is Omarion. I am an artist, not a variant” he explained. “So please be aware that, if you just so happen to run into me on the street, you don’t have to isolate for five days”. “While it’s important not to touch me and keep your distance, cause you know that’s how it’s supposed to be, you don’t need a negative test to dance to my music,” Omarion continued. On another video referencing his old boyband, he added that “The last time I had to do this was in 2000 when everyone confused Y2K with B2K”. Perhaps this is Omarion’s lot. Perhaps every 20 years, some awful catastrophe will befall humanity, and it’ll sound a bit like something vaguely related to something Omarion has done. Maybe in 2040 we’ll be crushed by an asteroid that will come to be colloquially known as Fat Albert, referencing Omarion’s 2004 movie. Or maybe aliens will arrive from the planet Kourtney and Khloe Take Miami, named after the reality show that Omarion appeared on for a single episode in 2019. Perhaps, even, we will be hit by a second pandemic, and science will inexplicably choose to name each new variant after a different disappointing R&B album, and the most deadly wave will carry the title of Omarion’s 2014 record, Sex Playlist. What a way to go. Still, you have to imagine that, deep down, Omarion must be quite pleased that his name is now synonymous with an unimaginably virulent strain of Covid. Because now, when you Google the word Omarion, you get swamped by results about his jokey clarification. And that means that all other news about Omarion has suddenly become much harder to find. That time Reuters ran a news story about Omarion asking his fans to pray for him because he happened to be in London – uninjured and inconvenienced – during the 2005 terrorist attacks? Very difficult to find now. Not impossible, but very hard.",Arts/Music,"Omarion is an R&B singer, not a Covid-19 variant",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/04/omarion-rb-singer-not-omicron-variant
1/5/2022,"Consumer borrowing on credit cards jumped to its highest level in more than a year in November, pushing all forms of household unsecured credit to £1.2bn, according to the latest Bank of England data. The increase in reliance on loans and credit cards exceeded City forecasts of a £0.8bn rise and beat the £0.6bn average of the previous six months.  Analysts said much of the increase reflected a more confident, pre-pandemic pattern of borrowing, but warned that many low income households had become more dependent on loans to cope with an inflationary squeeze on their finances from rising utility bills and the higher cost of the weekly shop. Households also cut back on the amount of money set aside in deposit accounts to £4.5bn in November, from an average over the previous 12 months of £11.2bn. The dramatic reduction in savings growth was seen as supporting the trend among some consumers to be more confident and spend a higher proportion of their income, while others on lower incomes reduced saving to cover higher bills. Martin Beck, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said that while some households cut back on saving and increased borrowing to cope with a squeeze on their household finances, “it also appears to be indicative of a more bullish consumer mindset”. The threat from the Omicron coronavirus variant would probably reverse the trends for higher borrowing and lower saving in December as households responded to increasing economic uncertainty, said Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. “Saving likely will remain elevated at least until March, when Omicron should be on the retreat,” he said. “Meanwhile, the outlook for inflation to rise to about 6% in the spring suggests that households will save much less this year to sustain their current level of expenditure, given the outlook for falling real disposable income.” He added that a consumer boom led by a rapid reduction of pandemic-related savings “continues to look very unlikely” while much of the money is needed to offset higher prices. Figures from the Bank of England for mortgage borrowing approvals revealed a fall for the sixth consecutive month in November to a level close to their pre-pandemic, 2015-19 average. The decline to 66,400 approvals a month is expected to become the norm over the rest of this year, said Tombs, despite higher levels of buyer inquiries in November, according to the RICS residential market survey, that pushed house price inflation up by 10%. “Higher mortgage rates look set to subdue the housing market,” he said. “The average quoted rate for a two-year fixed-rate mortgage, with a 75% loan-to-value ratio, jumped to 1.52% in November, from 1.30% in October, and likely will increase to about 1.7% by March, once the full impact of the recent rise in banks’ wholesale funding costs has been seen.” The Bank of England increased its base rate last month from 0.1% to 0.25% and investors are betting that it rises to at least 0.75% by the end of this year. Threadneedle Street officials appear to have set aside concerns that Britain’s economic recovery from three pandemic-related lockdowns slowed in the second half of last year as the loss of trade from Brexit and global shortages of goods affected consumer spending. Central bank policymakers have stressed that they need to tackle rising prices with higher interest rates to dampen demand.",Lifestyle/Money,UK consumers ramp up credit card debt and save less despite Covid crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/04/uk-consumers-credit-card-debt-saving-covid-bank-of-england
1/5/2022,"Israel has become the first country in the world to embark on a fourth Covid-19 vaccination campaign as part of efforts to stem rapidly rising infection rates caused by the Omicron variant. People over the age of 60 and healthcare workers who received their third shot more than four months ago became eligible for a second booster of Pfizer-BioNTech on Monday, after a limited rollout began last week for elderly people and those with compromised immune systems.  Officials had previously said they would wait for more data on the efficacy of a fourth shot before making it more widely available. The Israeli health ministry said on Tuesday, however, that even though it believes the threat posed by Omicron is minimal, it had been forced to act more quickly in the face of skyrocketing infection rates. The Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, said on Tuesday that the preliminary findings of an Israeli study found a fourth dose of vaccine boosted antibodies five-fold after a week. The country recorded its sixth highest daily tally since the pandemic began on Monday with 10,644 cases – a 360% rise on the week before, although the spread of the new variant has not been accompanied by corresponding rises in mortality. “At the moment, I wouldn’t recommend it for younger populations. Our recommendation on a fourth vaccine dose was issued quickly and because there was no choice,” Dr Tal Brosh, the health ministry’s pandemic team coordinator, told Army Radio. “We couldn’t wait to examine this over time in orderly studies. We think that the risk is tiny.” Within a day of making it available, 100,000 people received or made an appointment to get the second booster. The rapid pace of infection has also led to worries over testing kit shortages, with health minister Nitzan Horowitz saying that Israel would adjust its criteria for compulsory testing and focus primarily on people at high risk. As a result, more Israelis “will be required to exercise personal responsibility and perform tests at home”, he said in televised remarks on Monday. In an attempt to avoid a de-facto lockdown and widespread disruption to schools and the economy, precautionary self-isolation periods for people who have been exposed to coronavirus have been scaled down. The rise in domestic transmission also appears to have rendered international travel restrictions moot, with curbs imposed in November set to be lifted. Foreigners from 199 “orange” states will be allowed to enter the country from 9 January provided they are vaccinated or have recovered from Covid-19. The UK, US, UAE and Turkey remain on Israel’s “red” list. Despite an initial world-leading vaccination programme, vaccine hesitancy within the ultra-Orthodox and Arab communities means that only around 70% of Israel’s 9.3 million residents has received two doses of vaccine to date. Israel was also fiercely criticised by the UN for not doing more to facilitate a faster rollout for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, where full vaccination rates are lagging at around 31%.",News/World news,Israel embarks on fourth Covid vaccination campaign,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/israel-embarks-on-fourth-covid-vaccination-campaign
1/5/2022,"Romelu Lukaku has apologised to Thomas Tuchel for his controversial interview and is poised to return to Chelsea’s squad for the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final against Tottenham on Wednesday night. Tuchel held talks with Lukaku on Monday and was left satisfied that the £97.5m forward was remorseful after going public with his unhappiness with life at Stamford Bridge during an unauthorised interview with Sky Italia.  Chelsea’s manager said that the Belgian was determined “to clean the mess up” after being left out of last Sunday’s 2-2 draw with Liverpool. Tuchel was in a mood to move on and he intends to bring Lukaku back into the fold when Spurs visit Stamford Bridge. “First of all we were even in the background happy that we took the time that it needed to look calmly on it and talk calmly,” Tuchel said. “He apologised and is back in the squad for [Tuesday’s] training. “For me the most important thing was to understand and clearly understand and believe that it was not intentional. He did not do this intentionally to create noise in front of such a big game. And it’s the very first time even he has behaved like this.” Although Tuchel is pleased to have Lukaku back in contention, he said the 28-year-old must take responsibility for his comments. Lukaku created a storm after questioning Tuchel’s system and saying that he wants to return to Inter one day. The interview, aired last Thursday but conducted three weeks previously, did not go down well with anyone at Chelsea. “It’s not that big as maybe people want it to be, but it’s also not small,” Tuchel said. “But it is small enough to stay calm, accept an apology and to move on forward. He’s very aware of what happened and what he created and he feels the responsibility to clean the mess up. “Maybe we will have a bit of smell still from it, of course. He can handle it, but he also has no other choice. He cannot expect everybody to be super happy the very next day. But he’s still our player and we have good, good reasons and a lot of reasons to make him play for us, and to convince him and to fight hard that he’s our player. We’re happy he’s our player, we will protect him.” Trevoh Chalobah is out with a hamstring problem and Andreas Christensen is doubtful with a back injury but Timo Werner could be on the bench after recovering from Covid-19. Reece James and Ben Chilwell are long-term absentees. Tuchel said Thiago Silva is showing no signs of slowing down after the 37-year-old defender signed a one-year contract extension. “Benjamin Button,” he said. “Thiago Button of football. I know how much work is behind that. It is a miracle in a way because he came to this league and this schedule at the very end of his career, which was very brave. “We’re happy because a new contract makes him calm. Thiago needs to be calm because he’s a very sensitive and emotional person, which makes him also so precious for our team, for our dressing room. He can feel emotions, a different set of emotions to others. He can help so much in this.” ",Sport/Football,Chelsea’s Tuchel reveals Lukaku has said sorry and wants to ‘clean mess up’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/04/chelsea-lukaku-sorry-clean-mess-up-tuchel
1/5/2022,"As the Sydney Ashes Test rolls to the start line, the conversations about selections and form and conditions do not really matter. What matters is that it is miraculous this match is going ahead. England have almost an entire coaching staff wiped out by Covid. Australia have lost their Brisbane century-maker Travis Head, with three players named as cover. The Cricket Australia CEO, Nick Hockley, is out and Glenn McGrath will miss at least part of his foundation’s fundraising efforts. In Australian domestic cricket, Big Bash teams are losing quorum to the virus. Yet the show will go on.  Sydney is complicated, a town built on blood and corruption from the first days of its colonial founding. It is beautiful, with a beauty bought by wealth and subsidised by poverty. When you walk its hills at night it can be disarmingly gentle, the humid air curling around you, distant lights on quiet streets, the leaves of the Moreton Bay fig trees or the white-gold petals of frangipani unbearably lush. The harbour unwinds through the city’s core, unspooling in all directions, those waters captured in the words of Kenneth Slessor. To the east is the ocean coast and its storied beaches. To the west it becomes another city, growing ever outwards. In the past year, Sydney has also become the centre of Australia’s viral explosion. By now nobody can remember which wave this is, but a country that successfully held back a global inundation for nearly two years has now given in. Political leaders have sold the idea of a harmless variant and the fantasy that everybody getting sick and getting better will mean an end rather than just another waypoint on a road that has miles to run. For those in countries that have suffered worse and earlier, Australia’s situation may seem tame in comparison. But there has been an abdication of responsibility, leaving people to fend for themselves. It is in Sydney, as cases leap by the day and as leaders find ways to stop counting, that the fourth Ashes Test will be held. It is safe to say that had this series been played at any other time in the pandemic era, in any other country, between any other two teams, it would have been called off by now. England left South Africa in 2020 after one positive test from a worker at the team hotel. Australia gave South Africa an escalating list of demands in 2021 and still refused to tour. India left England last September when the coach and a physio were infected. The suggestion above is not hypothetical. And yet, this is the Ashes, the main source of revenue for the two boards involved. England’s authorities gain nothing directly from a series played in Australia, but need the reciprocal goodwill to make sure Australia’s touring commitments in the other direction go unaffected. CA’s entire financial existence hinges on the quadrennial infusion from this tour, with broadcast deals in particular based on the popularity of even a one-sided contest. Ultimately, it will not matter which players are available or where matches are played, as long as they are on television screens in sufficient quantity to meet the contract. There will be plenty of ticket revenue too, thanks to a New South Wales government that could most charitably be described as laissez-faire in its public health approach. Under current rules there will be no crowd caps, no requirement to wear masks aside from a few indoor areas, and no check-in required with the government app, which presumably means vaccination certificates will not be checked on entry. A large attendance is expected. So England’s players turn out for the crowd again, despite a week of shambolic preparation and the barrage of distraction from the situation they are in, with a team unchanged bar one bowling selection from the surrender in Melbourne. In fairness, there is little else on the selection front that could be done. The bigger question is how they can possibly find some confidence or motivation to tackle the rest of this series, rather than simply hoping to get it over. The Australians in contrast should be less affected, coming into the fourth Test with the buoyancy of the first three when almost every move has paid off. Aside from replacing Head for one match, that team will be unchanged from a position of strength rather than weakness, with Scott Boland retained after his dramatic debut with the ball at the MCG. Ultimately, the Test will be seen as sport fulfilling its purpose as a means of distraction for people who want to stop thinking about problems outside the ground. Sport is always more than that, inextricably part of its wider world, and this match cannot be divorced from its context. It should be seen, too, for illustrating the way cricket’s richest countries treat each other, as opposed to those outside their tiny club. But it is happening. Sydney is, most of all, a town of glitz and cash, where success matters more than how it is achieved. The show will always go on.",Sport/Sport,Ashes show will continue because there’s too much money at stake | Geoff Lemon,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/04/ashes-continue-too-much-money-at-stake
1/5/2022,"The European Union’s top diplomat is visiting the frontline of Ukraine’s war with Moscow-backed separatists, amid intensifying diplomatic activity in response to Russia’s buildup of troops on the country’s border. Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, began a two-day trip to Ukraine on Tuesday, before US-Russia talks in Geneva on 10 January and Nato-Russia talks on 12 January. Borrell is meeting Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, during a trip intended to show solidarity with Kyiv, which aspires to join Nato and the EU.  Tensions rose after Vladimir Putin last month set out security demands that Nato immediately rejected, including a veto on Ukraine entering the military alliance and a ban on troops and weapons along its eastern flank. The EU and US have accused Russia of stoking a crisis by massing tens of thousands of troops along its border with Ukraine. In an attempt to defuse tensions, Russian and US officials are to hold talks on 10 January in Geneva, where the US president, Joe Biden, and Putin met last year. Two days later, western countries will meet Russia in the Nato-Russia Council. Talks will continue on 13 January through the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a body that includes the US, its Nato allies, Russia and former Soviet states. The EU is anxious not to be sidelined. “We do not want to be, and must not be, spectators that are not involved and over whose heads decisions are made,” Borrell told Die Welt last week, adding this was also the view of the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, with whom he had spoken before Christmas. Borrell, who has been pushing for more EU military cooperation, said Europe had to be involved in the talks. “European security is our security. It is about us. Two parties, the US and Russia, or Nato and Russia, simply cannot negotiate about this – even if Moscow imagines it that way. We are not in the postwar period. There are some European states that are not Nato allies. There must be no Yalta 2,” he said referring to the second world war meeting of allied powers that accepted Soviet domination of eastern Europe. More than 14,000 people have been killed in Ukraine’s still-smouldering conflict with Russian-backed separatists since 2014. Ukraine’s ambassador to London, Vadym Prystaiko, called on western countries to announce preemptive sanctions against Russia to deter an attack, in contrast to the preference for reactive action. He suggested measures “that can be really painful to Russia” such as switching off its access to the Swift international payments system. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: “What Ukrainians are fearing the most” is that a “so-called big deal is baked somewhere behind our backs”. Western leaders, he said, should understand that Ukrainians have their own agenda. “The first item on this agenda is survival in the way we see it, to be close to western democracy.” Tensions have also forced non-Nato member Finland to restate its right to choose its security policy. In a new year message Finland’s president, Sauli Niinistö, said his country retained the right to join Nato, a point reiterated by the prime minister, Sanna Marin. “Finland retains the option of Nato membership,” she said. “We should uphold this freedom of choice.” Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said last month that if Finland and Sweden joined Nato “this would have serious military and political consequences, which would require an adequate response on Russia’s part”. Nato foreign ministers will hold a special meeting on Friday to discuss Russia’s military buildup and broader security issues, officials announced.",News/World news,EU’s top diplomat visits Ukraine frontline in show of solidarity,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/eu-top-diplomat-ukraine-frontline-show-solidarity-russia
