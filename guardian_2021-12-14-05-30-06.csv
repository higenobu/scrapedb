12/14/2021,"The prime minister’s Christmas challenge was thrown down on Sunday night. By Monday morning, the alarming reality of the task ahead became all too clear. Doctors, nurses and NHS executives will have to find a way of trebling the rate of booster vaccinations to more than 1.2m a day if they are to offer all eligible adults a jab by the end of December.  The target came as a surprise to the health service, which will now have to find staff to work through the holiday season, alongside the 750 miltary personnel drafted in to assist them. “The NHS is already under enormous pressure, and scaling up in this way will be a huge challenge,” said Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals and other NHS trusts. “GPs didn’t know about this in advance,” added Beccy Baird, a senior fellow at the King’s Fund thinktank. “Nobody is saying they won’t do it. I think they will throw everything at it. My WhatsApp has been exploding with planning messages from around the country.” Last week, the Covid booster programme was running at a little over 400,000 a day, according to the government’s last seven-day rolling average – and it peaked at 530,000 on Saturday. That leaves 23.6 million people across the UK who have had two jabs but are yet to receive a booster. The NHS now has 19 days to reach them. Assuming there is a pause on Christmas Day, the teams will have to jab 1.24 million people a day by the end of the year. The large queues, lasting in some cases for several hours, that sprang up outside hospitals and other major vaccination sites on Monday further demonstrated how difficult that will be. In the House of Commons, Sajid Javid appeared to acknowledge the enormity of the task – and offer some wriggle room too. “It is our joint view,” the minister told MPs, referring to the Department of Health and the NHS “that we can try to offer adults a chance to get boosted by the end of this month.” Although he expected not everybody eligible would come forward. MPs were told the new vaccination plan would involve “opening more vaccination sites, including pop-up and mobile sites that will be working seven days a week”. The hope is to train “thousands more volunteer vaccinators” and ask GPs and pharmacies “to do more”. But the lack of firm detail from the health secretary underlined how much more planning is required, with trust chiefs saying it could be a few days before final details are available as to how the vaccination acceleration will be achieved. Labour accused Javid of watering down the commitments made by Johnson. Wes Streeting, shadow health secretary, said the prime minister was “famous for over promising and under delivering”. He suggested the completion of the bulk of the booster jabs would have to wait “until January or even February”, although few believe it will be that long once the NHS gets up to speed. Similar concerns emerged in Scotland. The devolved administration, run by the Scottish National party, said it supported Johnson’s new deadline, but health secretary Humza Yousaf acknowledged it would be “extremely challenging”. Many GPs, who played such a critical part in the first phase of the vaccination programme, have gradually moved back to their full general practice, trying to catch up with the backlogs caused by Covid over what is nearly two years. By Monday, some were already switching focus back to booster vaccinations, a task now made urgent by the growing numbers of Omicron cases and the revised target. One GP practising in a small city in England said he and colleagues were involved in emergency meetings on Monday in their primary care network to work out how to proceed. “Can the NHS do it? Yep. Provided we are eased back on the usual activities. Hospitals throughout Covid have been ‘allowed’ to stop doing all sorts of stuff,” he said. Non-urgent appointments such as monitoring checkups would be the first to go, Baird said, although there is an acute concern across the health service that people will stop presenting to doctors with potentially more serious conditions. “Triage is going to become incredibly important,” Baird added. “That’s why, although it is incredibly frustrating for patients, they will need to give basic information to people like receptionists picking up the phone so doctors can make a decision about whether to see people.” Others wondered why Johnson couldn’t have provided those on the frontline with more warning. Palliative care doctor and writer Rachel Clarke tweeted: “This morning, please spare a thought for NHS staff who – at exactly the same time you did – found out last night from Boris Johnson they’d be delivering 1 million boosters a day from… today.”",News/World news,NHS gears up for ‘huge challenge’ to hit PM’s new booster jab target,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/13/nhs-gears-up-for-huge-challenge-to-hit-pms-new-booster-jab-target-omicron-covid
12/14/2021,"Good morning! Female candidates are lacking in safe seats at the next federal election, and Australia could be producing 100m mRNA vaccines by 2024. We also take a look inside Sydney’s only Aboriginal run drug and alcohol counselling centre. The company part-owned by the energy minister, Angus Taylor, illegally poisoned critically endangered grasslands and should restore native habitat, a ministerial review has concluded. The decision follows an 18-month examination of the original determination which ordered Jam Land to restore grasslands, and comes more than five years after the company poisoned the natural temperate grassland of the south-eastern highlands. Richard Taylor, one of Jam Land’s directors, said the company was considering whether it would appeal the decision in the federal court.  Female candidates are overrepresented for marginal seats at the next federal election, while safe seats for both major parties remain dominated by males, an analysis by Guardian Australia shows. About 60% of the candidates preselected so far for parliament’s 35 marginal seats across both major parties are female. The attempt by both major parties to increase the number of women in parliament comes after a review by sex discrimination commissioner Kate Jenkins of the culture of Parliament House that found gender inequality was a key driver of bullying, sexual harassment and sexual assault within commonwealth parliamentary workplaces. Australia may be manufacturing mRNA vaccines by 2024 under a deal struck with pharmaceutical giant Moderna. The long-term “strategic partnership” between the federal government, Victorian government and Moderna will allow 100m mRNA vaccines to be produced in Australia each year in a pandemic, starting in 2024 “pending regulatory and planning approval”. Fresh doubts have emerged over whether Australia can rely on boosting soil carbon to achieve its net zero emissions goals after a government report found soil carbon emissions may increase as the climate warms. Religious Australians will be given greater freedom of speech than non-religious expressions of conscience under a Coalition bill, a leading academic has warned. Prof George Williams argued the religious discrimination bill was “inconsistent” with international human rights law which “does not separate out religious speech for protection”. Australia’s eight planned nuclear submarines will cost $70bn at an “absolute minimum” and it’s “highly likely” to be more than that, with estimates the total could reach $171bn including inflation, defence analysts say. A proposed federal veto power over certain types of native forest regeneration has met with mixed reaction from farmers and industry, citing concerns it will stifle their opportunity to diversify their income in a changing climate. At least 64 people were killed in Kentucky’s deadly tornadoes on Friday, and 105 residents were still unaccounted for with the final death toll not expected for weeks. Afghanistan’s health system is on the brink of collapse because of western sanctions against the Taliban, international experts have warned. One expert said the Covid response had “almost ground to a halt” and the country was battling six different disease outbreaks. South and North Korea, China and the US have agreed “in principle” to declare a formal end to the Korean war, almost 70 years after the conflict ended in a shaky truce. Swedish coastguard officers are investigating alleged gross negligence and “drunkenness at sea” after one crew member of a capsized Danish barge died and another was feared drowned in Baltic sea collision. Established in 1996, Marrin Weejali is Sydney’s only Aboriginal-run drug and alcohol counselling centre. In Wiradjuri, the most widely spoken Aboriginal language in NSW, marrin means body and spirit, weejali means essence. The goal is to unite these two in the one person. The six Aboriginal counsellors at Marrin Weejali are from Mount Druitt and “all defeated the drug ice”. Co-founder Melinda Bonham says Aboriginal people make good counsellors. “With the sorrow and trauma you understand other people’s journey better. Non-Aboriginal people feel that walking in the door.” As a survivor of domestic violence, Alex O’Sullivan saw a lot of herself in the series Maid, and hopes the humour threaded throughout the show will draw in more viewers. “I hope that others will let the comedy introduce them to the ‘fuckery’ that is domestic abuse and the flawed system that overcomplicates the lives of its survivors because this is something people need to stop turning away from.” Having a big bag doesn’t mean you should carry everything. Experts share some very practical advice about how to give your bags a long life, including the simple things like spending an extra second to make sure bottles are firmly closed. Jenny Velakoulis, the owner of Evans Leather Repair, says she often sees bags that have been water damaged because “people put a water bottle back in their bag without sealing it properly”.

12/14/2021,"Bayern, as ever, have been dominant in the Bundesliga and they romped through the group stage winning six out of six, scoring 22 and conceding only three. Under Julian Nagelsmann they play with as high a line as they did under Hansi Flick, and Robert Lewandowski remains as prolific as ever. If there are doubts, they are only over two things: Bayern’s squad is not as deep as those of many of their rivals, making them susceptible to injuries, and top-class sides may be able to exploit their high line. Salzburg have in the past caused problems against other hard-pressing teams, notably against Liverpool two seasons ago when they lost 4-3 at Anfield and drew 2-2 in Austria, but they have been a little less open and fluent under Matthias Jaissle than they were under Jesse Marsch and took only one away point in the group.  Predicted winner Bayern The greatest opponent for Manchester City in Europe often seems to be themselves, or at least Pep Guardiola’s tendency to overcomplicate matters against teams whose counterattacking threat alarms him. It’s probably still too early in the competition for that to apply and, after a tricky group in which they finished above Paris Saint-Germain and RB Leipzig, Sporting represent a relatively kind opponent. Two group defeats don’t tell the full story: but for the absence of a consistent goal threat, City could easily have won away to PSG, and the defeat at Leipzig came after top spot had been secured. Sporting made it through despite losing half their six group games and their openness should suit City’s patient buildup. Kyle Walker’s suspension for at least the first leg could be exploited by Sporting’s left side where the wing-back Matheus Reis links with one of the inside-forwards. Predicted winner Manchester City Ajax have been superb in Europe this season (although they trail PSV by a point in the Eredivisie), winning six out of six. Sébastien Haller is in remarkable goalscoring form, the Edson Álvarez and Ryan Gravenberch pairing is impressing at the back of midfield and Dusan Tadic still knits everything together. Only Bayern scored more than their 20 group goals, but this is a testing tie, and one that suggests that, despite the rigid stratification of the modern game, there is still life beyond the big five leagues. Under Jorge Jesus, Benfica have looked a serious European force again, even if they are four points off the top domestically. They kept four clean sheets in the group stage, beat Barcelona comprehensively at home and were good enough on the break to score twice away to Bayern. Predicted winner Ajax Chelsea’s punishment for the sloppy draw at Zenit that cost them top spot in the group could have been a lot more severe (and fortune smiled on them twice given they got the same draw in both the invalid draw and the later one). Although Lille have improved recently, unbeaten in nine as Jocelyn Gourvennec begins to impose his style after replacing Christophe Galtier in the summer, they remain 11th in Ligue 1 and the squad is nothing like as strong as the one that beat PSG to the French title last summer. They can, as they showed by winning the vital final group game against Wolfsburg, sit deep and counter effectively, but so long as Chelsea get a couple of midfielders back and can rediscover the defensive solidity that has characterised them since Thomas Tuchel took over they should prevail. Predicted winner Chelsea Both sides must be a little baffled as to how they reached this stage. Atlético did not play well at all in the group, failing to score in three games and making it past Porto at the last only because some muscle memory of how to spite their way to victory kicked in. To an extent that has perhaps always been the Diego Simeone way but even by his standards progress was scratchy. United, meanwhile, twice burgled wins against Villarreal and took four points from two games against Atalanta despite being outplayed for long spells. At some point in Europe the late Cristiano Ronaldo winners will dry up, but perhaps under Ralf Rangnick they will be less in need of them. United have the better squad; the question is whether Rangnick can organise them and they can play cleverly enough to make that count. Predicted winner Manchester United For Juventus, this perhaps is recompense for drawing the defending champions, Chelsea, in the first round. Having topped a group that also included Zenit and Malmö, they now face the team 13th in La Liga, which is as kind as draws get at this stage. With four Europa League titles Unai Emery is a master of knockout competitions (as he showed by masterminding the 3-2 win over Atalanta in the final group game in what was effectively a shootout for qualification) and Juve, in present form, may be vulnerable. Three years of very strange transfer dealings will take time to put right, even after the return of Max Allegri. A raft of attacking injuries for Juve should have cleared up by February and they’re likely to be higher than sixth in the table. Predicted winner Juventus For fans of a certain generation, a meeting of Inter and Liverpool inevitably stimulates memories of the hugely controversial European Cup semi-final in 1965. Having won 3-1 at Anfield, Liverpool lost 3-0 at San Siro, and always insisted that one goal was scored straight from an indirect free-kick and another after the ball had been nicked from the keeper Tommy Lawrence as he tried to drop-kick it. Liverpool won both legs in their only other meeting, the last 16 in 2007-08. Inter, after a wobbly start as they reacted to the loss of Antonio Conte and Romelu Lukaku, have improved, a run of five straight league wins taking them top of Serie A. Edin Dzeko is 35 but he has looked just as effective in tandem with Lautaro Martínez as Lukaku did. But Liverpool, despite some concerns over their defence, won six out of six in the group stage. Predicted winner Liverpool The first draw offered up PSG v Manchester United, Lionel Messi v Cristiano Ronaldo, and while that possibility may have vanished, PSG against Real Madrid is a decent replacement (although Madrid, having drawn Benfica before the glitch on the draw that forced its annulment, are not surprisingly furious). Having lost at home to Sheriff in the second game of the group stage, they have improved significantly and are on a run of 10 straight wins in all competitions, although there remains a sense that, for all the quality of Karim Benzema and the blossoming of Vinícius Júnior, they are over-reliant on an ageing midfield. PSG, meanwhile, have found the addition of Messi has unbalanced the squad even further, effectively forcing them into playing a 7-0-3 against Manchester City. Both sides are miles clear domestically; neither, probably as a consequence, look at all convincing in Europe.

12/14/2021,"The sale of Liverpool Victoria, or LV=, to private equity is dead, but the dissatisfaction around the proposed deal with Bain Capital will be harder to shift. That is not only because the same beleaguered board of LV intends to stay in place and lead the next chapter – negotiations with fellow mutual Royal London. It is also because the rules around transactions involving mutuals lack a basic level of accountability to the owners, the members. As noted in this column a few weeks ago, life is simpler in the quoted-company arena. You get a clean process, overseen by the Takeover Panel, which operates on the excellent principle that the owners (shareholders in that case) must be treated fairly and have full opportunity to judge the merits of a proposed deal, which means giving them clear, accurate and timely information. Any statement that is even vaguely misleading or incomplete is pounced upon.  By contrast, LV’s board only truly started to explain its thinking on the Bain proposal when the prospect of defeat by members’ vote felt real. The whole saga got off on the wrong foot because the directors hadn’t formally sought a mandate for a sale. As an excellent report in April from the all-party parliamentary group for mutuals put it, the board “swung from praising its [LV’s] capital strength to justifying its demutualisation within the space of the year”. That is possible, one might guess, because there’s no well-resourced body equivalent to the Takeover Panel looking out for the interests of members. Regulators appear agnostic on ownership structures and the “independent experts” employed to give an opinion on methodology are appointed by the same leadership whose handiwork they’re judging. Meanwhile, mutuals seem starved of the political care and attention that the rest of the financial services scene enjoys. When the chancellor frets about the lack of technology floats in London, the system goes into overdrive with an all-singing review into loosening the listing rules. With friendly and mutual societies, the perennial problem (and a factor at LV) is relative lack of access to new capital. But proposed legislation in 2015, supported by regulators, that would have allowed the issuance of a hybrid form of deferred shares stalled after a dispute with HM Revenue & Customs and has never been revisited. The lack of urgency is perhaps because, prior to LV, nobody had attempted a demutualisation for years. If the Bain proposal, although unsuccessful, signals a change in the weather, the regulations need to catch up. Gareth Thomas MP’s parliamentary group suggests a review of the law governing friendly societies and mutuals, covering the areas above and more. The chancellor should give it a fair hearing. The LV muddle was bad enough; a repeat would be worse. The big boast from Jon Lewis, chief executive of outsourcer Capita, was that 2021 would see the first growth in revenues for six years. With 11 months on the clock, the promise is close to being fulfilled – but only just. Many would call an advance of 0.6% a case of going sideways. The share price, on the other hand, tumbled by 19%. That’s a big move, given that Lewis – four years after inheriting a mess at Capita – maintains his “corporate transformation” strategy is making progress. He’s correct on measures such as debt-reduction and disposals. Capita, primarily divided between its public-sector division and the oddly-named Experience unit (think call centres and data analytics), is a simpler business these days. But top-line growth still matters, and it’s hard to believe Lewis would have made such a fanfare about the six-year comparison if he thought the gap would be so tight. Public sector revenues are fine, but there’s not much he can do about companies’ tendency to bring services in-house during Covid. And a corporate travel agency is obviously getting whacked. The horizon for a real recovery keeps getting longer. NatWest’s £264m fine after admitting breaching anti-money laundering regulations is a big number. But the scale of the bank’s failure was spectacular: this was a case involving a small Bradford jeweller making deposits of £365m over five years, mostly in cash. So, well done, the Financial Conduct Authority. This was its first criminal prosecution of a financial institution under 2007’s anti-money-laundering legislation, and it succeeded. But, tell us, please, why the civil route has been preferred in other cases. Yes, there has to be a threshold of seriousness to justify the time and expense of a criminal prosecution, but the FCA has never tried to define it except in loose terms. It should. Even more than a large fine, a corporate criminal conviction gets noticed.",News/Business,The LV= muddle shows mutuals need their own Takeover Panel | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2021/dec/13/the-lv-equals-muddle-shows-mutuals-need-their-own-takeover-panel
12/14/2021,"Sajid Javid has fuelled Tory anger over the government’s plan B Covid measures before votes that are expected to mark the biggest rebellion of Boris Johnson’s premiership. The health secretary was accused of “shifting the goalposts” by confirming that in the new year Covid passports would require proof of three jabs – not two – or a negative test.  About 80 Conservative backbenchers have already signalled their opposition to Covid certificates before Tuesday’s vote, with cabinet ministers including Michael Gove deployed to phone colleagues and get them back on side to reduce the embarrassment facing Johnson. The plan B votes are expected to pass, but only thanks to Labour support. To tackle the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant, Javid announced in parliament on Monday that to qualify for a Covid pass, people would need proof of a recent negative test result or three jabs, rather than two. He said the change would come into force “once all adults have had a reasonable chance to get their booster jab”. The move is part of a drive to boost inoculation levels and increase the safety of large events and nightclubs, where the passes will be needed. So far, 89% of those eligible in the UK have had a first jab, but the figure falls to 81% for second doses and 41% for the booster. Despite Javid’s insistence that many of his own MPs were rallying against a “misleading description of what the government is proposing”, he was met by growing hostility. Andrea Leadsom, a former cabinet minister, quoted a constituent who hit out at “intrusive and incoherent government regulations,” while one-time Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith admitted being “concerned about the mixed and heavy messaging coming from the government”. Mark Harper, chair of the Covid Recovery Group, also said it was “not acceptable to keep governing this country by decree” and hit out at “late night television addresses” after Johnson’s statement on Sunday evening. Javid stressed that plan B measures – which include working from home and more mask-wearing as well as Covid passports – were necessary because hospitalisations and deaths lag two weeks behind cases, and would “dramatically increase” in the run-up to the new year. The planned change to vaccination requirements for a Covid passport galvanised Tory anger on the eve of votes on plan B, one of which is expected to focus on the certificates. Several Conservative MPs accused the government of moving the goalposts. One told the Guardian: “I think it’ll strengthen the resolve of some of the 80 opponents who are flaky, and win over more … It’s ridiculous, because there is no chance that everyone is going to get their booster by the end of this month – that’s just way out in the stratosphere as a concept.” The MP said if at least 80 Tories rebelled on Tuesday, that would be Johnson’s effective Commons majority. They added: “These restrictions are the gateway drug to more serious restrictions down the line. I think we’ll be on plan X, Y or Z by Christmas.” Another backbencher said “scare stories” about further restrictions beyond plan B had “actually had the opposite effect on rebels, who mainly see the reintroduction of restrictions as a slippery slope”. Among the growing number of Tory MPs who signalled that they would oppose some of the plan B measures were many of the 2019 intake. Those who declared their opposition on Monday included Tom Hunt, Robbie Moore and Shaun Bailey. Labour will back all the plan B measures, meaning their approval is all but guaranteed. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, accused the government of “rowing back on the target set yesterday” after Johnson said all adults would be able to get a booster by 31 December, while Javid said they would receive an “offer” by the end of the year to book their third jab. Streeting said: “The prime minister has got to learn to be straight with people, because he is undermining public trust and confidence in the government and public health measures at a critical time.” Further Covid restrictions were also introduced in parliament on Monday, with Tory MPs’ Christmas drinks reception cancelled by the House of Commons Commission. Banqueting, tours and education activities were all cancelled with immediate effect.",News/Politics,Sajid Javid accused of ‘shifting goalposts’ over plan B Covid measures,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/13/sajid-javid-shifting-goalpoasts-plan-b-covid-measures
