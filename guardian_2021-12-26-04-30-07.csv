12/26/2021,"About 200 temperature records in the US may be broken over the next several days as warm air across Texas and the south-east is predicted to bring spring or even summer-like conditions, making Christmas Day likely to be the warmest in 50 to 100 years in some areas.  The temperatures could make this the warmest December on record for many cities in the region including Dallas, Houston, New Orleans, St Louis, Kansas City and Chicago. In some areas, records have already been broken: Wichita Falls in Texas hit 91F (33C) Friday, and Grandfield, Oklahoma, reached 89F. Both beat their Fourth of July high – back at in the middle of summer. Nor were they alone. “Dallas, Houston, Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Oklahoma, Little Rock, Arkansas, and Memphis, Tennessee, all stand to match or top the record high for 25 December this Saturday,” AccuWeather senior meteorologist Brett Anderson said. The unseasonal heat will bring a forecast high to Dallas on Christmas day of 83F, six degrees under its Fourth of July high. Houston has a forecast high of 81F, which is nine degrees below its Independence Day reading. While temperatures 5-10 degrees above average are not totally uncommon for a few days, temperatures 10-12 degrees over an extended period – especially for an entire month – are rare. And while individual weather events can’t be blamed on a changing climate, extreme temperatures are more increasingly common because of global heating. The high temperatures, coupled with low humidity, 25mph winds and minimal predictions for rainfall, have triggered winter wildfire warnings. The Storm Prediction Center issued an advisory for parts of west Texas and Oklahoma and east Colorado on Sunday. The warm trend is anticipated to continue through midweek before temperatures come down, but only slightly. In contrast, western states in the US are experiencing coastal rain and heavy high elevation snowfall and more than 6m people along the California coast under storm warnings that could bring 4in of rainfall throughout the next five days. Meteorologists say the conditions are caused by Arctic air pushing into the Pacific north-west that have produced a White Christmas for Seattle and Portland, which could see 4 inches of snow on Christmas Day. Seattle, reported CNN, has only seen snow on Christmas Day nine times in 127 years, while Oregon is in a state of emergency due to the potential for hazardous winter weather conditions and a sustained freeze. Parts of the north-east US, meanwhile, are under a winter weather advisories, largely due to freezing rain, though New England could see more widespread snowfall by Saturday night.",News/US news,Christmas roast: temperatures soar in Texas and US south-east,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/25/christmas-temperature-us-texas-records-south-east
12/26/2021,"Bump isn’t the kind of production one is likely to describe as kitchen sink drama, or vérité, or any other cerebral-sounding words – it is too accessible and unassuming. And yet this very enjoyable and intelligently made series, co-created by Claudia Karvan and Kelsey Munro, is presented in a “window to the world” style, sustaining the sense of realism apparent from the very first episode but increasingly manifest over its arc.  The show’s premise – and the focus of its very first episode – illustrates what my colleague Brigid Delaney described as a “real-life urban myth”. On a seemingly normal day, the astute and opinionated year 11 student Oly (Nathalie Morris) packs her lunch, goes to school and then gives birth –without even knowing she’s pregnant. Before long Oly, knocked for six, is yelling at a nurse in hospital who is holding her baby to “get that thing away from me!” – an early indication that the show isn’t going to take a sappy approach to parenthood and family. It is also an early indication of Oly’s unpredictable, bolshie behaviour – which sometimes feels innocuous, sometimes a little confronting, but is always rooted in thoughtfully drawn characterisation. The most satisfying element of the series, throughout the first season and now into its second, is the development of Oly’s character, thanks in no small part to a fine performance from Nathalie Morris – who is so wholly “her” that the idea of somebody else playing the part is almost unthinkable. Audiences return to a show like this not for visual flashiness or witty writing, but for characters with whom they become increasingly familiar and – if the series is jiving the way it should – increasingly attached to, almost as if they’re people in our own world. In Bump, their lives per se are not necessarily eventful but filled with circumstances earnestly treated by the writers and directors as opportunities to develop our relationship with them. There are other strong characters too – including Oly’s parents, Angie (the ever-charming Karvan) and Dom (Angus Sampson, in his most interesting Australian performance since his butt-clenching role in The Mule), who are separated but still on relatively good terms. Plus there’s Oly’s former boyfriend Lochie (Peter Thurnwald), who came out in the first season; the father of Oly’s baby, Santi (Carlos Sanson Jnr), who is an emotionally sensitive stoner; and Santi’s parents, Bernadite (Claudia de Giusti) and Matias (Ricardo Scheihing Vasquez), the latter with whom Angie becomes romantically and perhaps regretfully entwined. Season two begins by exploring a question that has bemused and befuddled every human society since time immemorial: “Why do boys draw cocks on walls?” I half expected a flashback to early humans painting on the walls of the Lascaux caves or some such wondrous ancient location, stepping back and admiring their lewd art. But this scene is already a jump back in time – to a moment in Santi’s childhood, during which a younger Bernadite raises the aforementioned question and also wonders why doodles of vulvas are nowhere near as ubiquitous as cock and balls. The ensuing dramas (this review encompasses season two’s first three eps) are large and small, spanning everything from big emotional events to icky scenes with body fluids. The former involves the fallout from Angie and Matias’s dalliance, and an example of the latter occurs when Santi sucks the snot out of his baby’s nose. According to his stoner pal, he clearly enjoyed the moment: “Babies can’t blow their own noses; it’s the only way.” In this scene some parents will nod their heads and say to themselves, “Yeah, I’d do that for my kid.” Everybody else will think, “That’s friggin gross.” At times Bump comes across as a little too effortless, the writers prioritising events that don’t feel particularly significant – as if the real drama is elsewhere, in some other scene that hasn’t been depicted. That’s part of the appeal of “window to the world”-style productions, implying that we are observing only one impression of the narrative universe. It takes no effort to return to this world, that’s for sure: the tone is light but meaningful, and the characters keep growing on you.

12/26/2021,"Sailing has always been something best appreciated from land, I thought. Crisp, white sails dotting Sydney harbour more of a beautiful sight than an activity to get involved in. I am also not fantastically wealthy having opted for a career in journalism rather than, say, owning a casino, so have long assumed this rules me out.  And if money was no barrier, skills surely would be. The Sydney to Hobart race, Australia’s best known yacht event starting Boxing Day every year, certainly makes it look daunting. But here I am at a marina at the picturesque Rushcutters Bay in Sydney stepping aboard Karma – a 35ft Dufour – for a sailing lesson. My instructor is David Kelly who took up sailing in 1985, “because it was cheaper than flying”. Not exactly dispelling the rich man’s sport theory so far, but we’ll come back to that. Beginners would normally start with a minimum two-day training course ($595 at EastSail). We have only two hours. A quick chat about wind direction and different sailing modes – that I hope will make more sense on the water – and we’re pulling out into Sydney harbour on a glorious summer morning. Life jackets on of course, although Kelly reassures me the only time a student fell in was trying to get off the boat before the floating pier was installed. It seems in no time at all, I’m at the helm sailing “close haul”. This term has something to do with the wind in relation to the sails that I have still not fully grasped. There are many new nautical terms. Before we’ve reached the Harbour Bridge, I do a tac (turn the boat 90 degrees) and pull some ropes to assist with a “gybe” where the sail switches from one side of the vessel to the other. Kelly takes over so I can look up at the underside of the bridge I’ve driven over many times – a less conventional but no less impressive Sydney view. I realise how tense I’ve been at the helm, anxious about tipping over as the wind tilts us alarmingly to one side, keeping the sails in the right spot or avoiding other boats zipping about. For Kelly it’s the opposite. “It’s so natural. Sailing was my sanity. You have to slow down, it’s all about feeling the water.” So is it a rich man’s sport? “It definitely can be but it doesn’t have to be,” Kelly reassures. In terms of what to wear, the only thing you wouldn’t already find in an average wardrobe is a pair of gloves (about $30) but even that’s not essential. Crucially, you don’t need to own a boat. Because those that do need crew. The main cost is in gaining competence. After completing the initial two-day training, there’s the option to do a further three days to achieve competent crew or day skipper level ($1,125 at EastSail). There are other models, but this is the UK’s Royal Yachting Association certification, which is widely known and internationally recognised. At this point you’re ready to join a crew. The Cruising Yacht Club of Australia has a concierge scheme to match skippers with crew members or you can simply rock up a couple of hours before a race starts and ask boat owners directly. The trick, Kelly says, is to make yourself useful. Even if that’s helping to fold a sail or making a mean toastie in a galley kitchen, Kelly says “there’s a role for everyone”. He offers a word of caution: some clubs are “a bit posh, bit full of themselves”. Look for races run by clubs that have sail schools attached and you’ll generally find some graduate-friendly events. You can also organise a group of six to eight people and charter a boat. Prices start at about $1,000 a day. Kelly has sailed in many places – Singapore, Hong Kong, Seattle – but says Sydney is the best. “My favourite thing is to go for a sail up to Quarantine Bay, drop anchor, have a swim, have a beer.” So it is possible to enjoy sailing without being a mogul. It does seem inevitable, however, that aficionados will dream of owning their own boat one day, at which point you’re looking at a small fortune and ongoing maintenance costs. As we’re cruising around the harbour, Kelly points out the yacht he owns, with three others. It’s called Sanity.

12/26/2021,"Nick Bowman gestures to the old-fashioned gaming consoles littering his desk. “Whenever I am having kind of a crappy day, I pull out the Nintendo,” he says, pointing. “That’s a licensed one. I also have a Raspberry Pi that I have all my emulators on. [And] I have the original Pokemon Red on my smartphone.”  Bowman, an associate professor of journalism and creative media industries at Texas Tech University, has a vast collection of consoles and hundreds of cartridges and discs. Like me, he grew up in a time when video games were intimately tied to a physical device. We played using handheld consoles, while the games themselves were on cartridges – the kind you pulled out and blew out the dust from if it wasn’t working. As kids we spent hours immersed in gaming worlds, but when our devices were lost, broken or superseded, the game likely was too. While music and literature has long been well-preserved, and constantly re-released, games weren’t like this. For years our favourite games were inaccessible because they were non-interoperable: the cartridges didn’t work on other devices, and old computer games wouldn’t run on newer operating systems. Playing them was only possible thanks to a handful of dedicated individuals, often anonymous, who remade or ported them to work on current systems. “Think about all the cultural capital that was tied up in cartridges and power cables that our parents threw away,” says Bowman. “And then a couple of people found it and put it back together.” Bowman’s research shows how powerful the nostalgia from playing old video games can be. For many people, games are intimately tied to social networks. We played Mario tennis with our friends, or racing games with our dads. “We already know that games are a source of psychological wellbeing,” says Bowman. “…With nostalgia you get sort of a bonus relatedness because you get to connect to yourself. You’re replaying a game from a positive childhood memory. Those things can be particularly powerful for short-term stress release. “It’s almost like a digital smoke break. Return to this past life, play through it, and reconnect with yourself, literally. “In our research we found that people who have social nostalgia memories – memories of playing games with friends in the past – they feel connected to themselves and their friends in the past, and they also feel connected in the present.” Nowadays, companies are going after the market for nostalgic gaming. Nintendo is slowly adding Nintendo 64 games, some of which I played as a kid, to its Switch console. “I don’t think the industry was all that interested in providing nostalgic games until the retrogramers and the modders and the emulators took it upon themselves,” says Bowman. “Coders and hackers and modders, I think, saved classic gaming. They showed industry that there is a market.” The Raspberry Pi Bowman has on his desk is a basic computer loaded with emulators. Emulators are software that can behave like the hardware of a video game console, allowing you to simulate a console on your computer. The coders and hackers that created the emulators are driven by many factors. One of the most famous emulator projects is MAME, which was first released almost twenty five years ago and has had hundreds of contributors. “That one probably has one of the most noble goals of emulators,” says Stuart Cairne, a Tasmanian software developer. “It was trying to emulate the original hardware and preserve it so that we don’t lose that part of our history. Some of the games that it emulates are from the mid and late seventies, or even earlier than that – hardware that was only available in universities.” But other emulators are created simply for the joy of playing them, or because of the technical challenge of making them work. Many developers still have access to the old devices, and even go to the extent of opening and inspecting the chips so they can replicate bugs and make accurate digital recreations. Carnie, whose day job is at a data company, often found himself contributing to these projects so favourite games like Monkey Island would work on the operating system he used. “I wanted to play the games, and being a developer I had the tools and skills ... I would often bring them to whatever platform I was on, which has been a Mac for the past 20 years. “It’s fun just to see these things come back. It’s all that nostalgia too – there’s that game I used to play when I was 10 or 13, and now it’s working on my PC.” After the launch of the iOS App Store in the late 2000s, Carnie started working on a Commodore 64 emulator for iPhones and iPads. He and his partner in the project joined up with a big Danish game developer with industry connections so they could license everything. “We had licensed the branding, so we were able to sell it as a Commodore64,” Carnie says. The emulator sold on the app store for US$4.99 and included five games: Dragons Den, Le Mans, Jupiter Lander, Arctic Shipwreck, and Jack Attack. Sometimes it was impossible to find who owned the rights to games – over the decades many of the companies went bust, or their catalogues were sold. “We had some big names on the emulator that we had fully licensed from people who had still retained their IP … but we also found that some of the developers we were able to communicate with no longer had the rights to it or did not know where [the rights] had gone.” “We had one [game] we had released on the Commodore 64 for free because we couldn’t track down the rights to it, and then the Bruce Lee foundation messaged us to say it had to be taken down because Bruce Lee’s name cannot be used,” Carnie says. For many years emulators were the link to our childhoods. They existed, as Bowman and Carnie note, in somewhat of a legal grey area. Some of the most popular – such as Visual Boy Advance, a classic Gameboy game – were created by anonymous individuals, who sometimes faced lawsuits against them. Mostly emulators were technically difficult to use. The amateur-created software could be hard to find and install, and buggy. The grey market for the games was full of shady websites. “It was hard,” says Bowman. “[Just to play them] you had to learn a lot of coding on the fly. I remember downloading those files and you had to trust the link, and unzip it and load it to this file and not that file. And it was always kind of a wink, wink culture. “I remember that joy, I think it was [the game Contra], [of] hearing the sound. You go into the emulator and you have to do all the settings and I finally got it to play and all of a sudden ... I remember getting tingles that I was about to play a game, on my work computer, that I hadn’t seen since I was in my jammies.” Even if you still physically possess an old game disc, it can be a nightmare to play. My friend Praveen owns a disc of an old Star Wars shooting game originally created for MS Dos. Actually playing it started with trying to find a copy of Microsoft Windows 95. “After that it’s pretty straightforward,” he says. But as he continues, it really doesn’t sound like it. “You have to use the command line to install it,” he says. “The other cool thing about this game is that it’s one of the early games with sound. But if you want to hear the audio you have to manually configure your sound card.” Pretty straightforward. “Hardware comparability is a huge issue with these old games,” Praveen says. “They can’t ‘comprehend’ things like 1GB of RAM when they were designed to run on 16MB. “There’s a certain level of competence and pride that comes with grabbing a controller. Turning on a 30-year-old game and entering in the same code you did when you were 11, and it works,” says Bowman. “For a lot of older gamers we pride ourselves on not going to the guide but remembering it from when we were kids.” Retro gaming is now more democratised than ever. Emulators have become much easier over the years – even available on smartphones. I have encountered numerous people who dipped into their childhood games to get through Covid lockdowns and other stressors. A recent YouTube video by someone who remade Simpsons Hit & Run has had more than five million views. It’s a game I also played for countless hours as a kid. Except I didn’t actually own it, so all those hours were actually at my cousin’s house. He remembers this too. “I don’t think it would be a stretch to say that those hobbyists, emulators and rom makers may well have saved gaming in two ways: provided people access to content that had become completely inaccessible, and reminded us of properties that we had actually forgotten about,” says Bowman.",Arts/Games,Nostalgic gaming: how playing the video games of your youth reconnects you to yourself,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/dec/26/nostalgic-gaming-how-playing-the-video-games-of-your-youth-reconnects-you-to-yourself
12/26/2021,"As the Observer goes to press on Christmas Day, the UK’s ruling Conservatives are contemplating breaking the back of the National Health Service. Maybe they are right to avoid taking all but the most cursory precautions against Omicron. Perhaps the relative mildness of the new variant will outweigh its wild infectiousness. The fact remains that, although they want the crisis to be over, they have no idea if it is over. And on this speculative hope, Conservative MPs are prepared to run the potentially fatal political risk of collapsing the NHS. So much attention focuses on Boris Johnson’s unfitness to be prime minister that the dissolution of the parliamentary Conservative party into warring bands of ideologues and fantasists is in danger of being lost. Its contempt for rules, its willingness to gamble away its chances of holding power show a movement in the grip of radical rightwing delusion. Contrary to much political commentary, the Conservatives have not reinvented themselves to advance the interests of their new working-class voters. The aristocratic disdain of a Downing Street that partied while forcing the country to lock down shows how widely the values of the Tory elite and the average voter have diverged.  A supposed truth about politics, which has been dignified with the technocratic title of “May’s law of curvilinear disparity”, holds that the professional politicians at the top of a party cannot afford to be as extreme as activists below them. Members are free to indulge their whims. Serious politicians must hug the electorate close if they hope to attain power. All attempts to create laws as certain as the laws of physics to predict human behaviour fail. The state of the Conservative party shows that May’s law is no exception. A study for the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank found Conservative MPs were more lost in rightwing ideology than Conservative members, Conservative voters and, naturally, the electorate as a whole. Almost a quarter of Conservative members and 73% of the public agreed that there was “one law for the rich and another for the poor” (as Johnson’s career has shown). Just 5% of the Conservative MPs the authors surveyed believed it. Large majorities thought that big business takes advantage of the public and that ordinary people do not get a fair share of the nation’s wealth. Conservative politicians did not. The rightwing doctrine they cling to is not a coherent system of thought. I find the best way to understand it is as truculent over-confidence. Like angry children, Conservatives demand that the world be as they want it to be and not as it is. They do not realise that they have caught themselves in a feedback loop. The nationalism and Thatcherism that once brought them electoral successes are threatening to destroy the values they think they uphold. Read the Tory press and you cannot miss the laments at the failure to turn the UK into a capitalist powerhouse. Lord Frost walks out of the cabinet saying Brexit should have brought a “lightly regulated, low-tax” country. Liz Truss positions herself to benefit from Johnson’s downfall by posing as a free-trade fundamentalist who will unchain Britannia from the shackles of the state. They still cannot admit that Brexit was an attack on wealth-creation. The Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts it will cause twice the long-term economic damage of Covid, leave trade 15% lower, bring a £100bn annual hit to national income and cost £40bn in lost tax revenue. When you shrink the tax base, you have to raise taxes to cover the shortfall just to stand still. When you shrink the private sector, the size of the state grows in comparison by definition. When you pull your country out of the largest free-trade area in the world, you have no right to protest about economic decline. “Move fast and break things” may work as a slogan in Silicon Valley but it isn’t a programme for government. The creative destruction Conservatives thought they were unleashing with Brexit has created nothing of value and left only rubble behind. Their behaviour shows that at some level they grasp the magnitude of their failure. All revolutions devour their own children as the euphoria of the initial uprising degenerates into panic. The speed with which the Brexit revolutionaries are devouring theirs is the best indication of the depth of their insecurity. They don’t even have the table manners to wait until the kids are out of nappies before sharpening the carving knives. Johnson won the Brexit referendum and the 2019 election. Now the right cannot wait to be rid of him. With a roar of “enough is enough”, Steve Baker bans Nadine Dorries from a Conservative WhatsApp group for the crime of praising the prime minister. Her work in undermining the BBC counts for nothing. In Conservative culture, as in all cancel cultures, you must show a demeaning adherence to the ideological line or you are finished. When Johnson made Sajid Javid health secretary in June, the Tory press hailed him as a Covid “hawk”, who would resist any attempt to lock down the economy. This month, fears about the Omicron variant compelled him to introduce modest restrictions. Conservative MPs did not say that, if even Javid believed there was danger ahead, they should take notice. They heckled him in the Commons as he made the case for caution with cries of “resign” and “what a load of old tripe”. “Instead of taking him at face value, they are painting him as the enemy,” Labour’s health spokesman, Wes Streeting, told me in a voice filled with disbelief, and I thought, with a hint of anticipation as well. Every senior opposition figure I talk to believes the Conservatives are no longer capable of governing themselves or the country. They have dissolved into an extremist rabble that is contorted by magical thinking, heresy hunts, fits of temper and doctrinal spasms. If the opposition parties cooperate, and if Labour can break with the calamity of the Corbyn years, there is a chance that they can eject this government from power. A faint chance, I grant you, given the scale of the Tories’ electoral advantage but a chance nevertheless. And with that uncharacteristically cheery thought, I wish you all a merry Christmas.

12/26/2021,"We’re not off to a good start. I’m fumbling with my cap, the rubber clinging to my head lopsidedly, my hair straggling out. I take it off to start again and the woman who has swum the fickle English Channel more times than any other human, the “Queen of the Channel”, instructs me in how to correctly apply a swimming cap.  Chloë McCardel and I are going for an ocean swim at Bondi. She dives into the foamy sea ahead of me – more slender mermaid than broad-shouldered Amazonian. Knee deep, I feel the current suck at my flesh. It’s not one of Bondi’s better days. Chest deep, I realise I’m being dragged out and my very amateur ocean-swimming abilities are no match for this surf. Panic rises. McCardel is an impatient white-cap in the distance. What was I thinking, suggesting a swim with superwoman? By any objective measure, Chloë McCardel is also a crazy woman, her commitment to putting herself through demented levels of physical and mental torture almost inexplicable. “I own crazy, I wear it as a badge of pride,” she tells me later. On 13 October, the 36-year-old Melbourne-born, Sydney-based ultra-marathon swimmer set a new world record, completing her 44th crossing of the English Channel in 10 hours and one minute. She left the water, stood on a French rock at Pointe de la Courte Dune and raised her lanolin-smeared arms in victory. McCardel’s 44 crossings of the world’s busiest shipping highway include three non-stop doubles (to France and back) and one triple non-stop (to France, back to England, then to France again). The “King of the Channel”, Englishman Kevin Murphy, has done only 34 crossings. McCardel has conquered other waters too: in 2014 she set a world record for the world’s longest non-stop ocean swim – 124.4km from Eleuthera Island in the Bahamas to the capital Nassau, a 41-hour, 21-minute journey. But the bare numbers and facts hardly tell McCardel’s story. There are good times when the sea is as smooth as a pane of glass, the water clarity is extraordinary, dolphins bounce around and she feels her technique is exquisite. But things can go bad quickly. In 2013 she jumped into the sea in Havana, Cuba, to attempt to be the first person to swim the 166km to the Florida Keys without a shark cage. After about 10 hours of heavenly swimming, with 40 or 50 hours ahead of her, and dusk setting in, McCardel started seeing translucent shapes many metres below her. “I’m like, ‘Oh, that’s interesting,’ and then literally like 10 minutes later, it was like a blanket underneath me just rising up and I’m like, ‘Oh this is not going to turn out well.’” She was stung dozens of times by what is believed to have been a jellyfish similar to a box or irukandji. Almost immediately, her right arm was paralysed and she could no longer use it to stroke. She called to her support team to get her out but they did not realise the extent of the problem and shouted affirmations – keep going, you can do it. In a marathon swim you never get out. The jellyfish were still rising. McCardel curled into a ball to reduce the surface area of her body. “Once my head went under the water, they were like: ‘We need to get her out.’” Twenty minutes or so after the first sting, she was hauled out of the water on to the boat. “I was whimpering, I was making a dying animal noise and they were picking the jellyfish stings off me. One person even pulled one out of my mouth like a bit of spaghetti. I just wanted to die – the pain was horrific.” So many other stories: the first time she attempted the Channel in 2009, she signed up for a double crossing and the captain of the support boat lost her for a time during a dark and stormy night when she was two-thirds of the way back to English shores. “They drifted away and I was screaming out ‘Don’t leave me behind’ – I was terrified.” She was battling two-metre waves and felt the ghostly presence of hulking ships which take a kilometre to come to a stop. During her first attempt to triple-cross the Channel in 2011, the weather turned. She was floundering, barely stroking with one arm and resisted her support crew’s attempts to get her out. “My brain was not functioning.” When she was pulled out she couldn’t walk, was delirious and mumbling and dangerously hypothermic. In intensive care at Canterbury Hospital, a doctor told her that 30 more minutes in the water and she would have been dead. There are clues in McCardel’s childhood to the woman she would become. Her role models – three older and sporty siblings – told her she could only play with them if she kept up. “I wanted to be better at whatever game they were playing or I wanted to be like them and so I would push myself.” When she was about seven, she insisted on peddling with her 14-year-old brother on his paper round. He told her she couldn’t because she wouldn’t keep up. “I’m like, ‘No, I will keep up, I’m coming.’” Her parents were far from pushy and when she started to swim competitively as a teenager, they refused to take her to swim training at 5am (they agreed to pick her up afterwards). On weekdays, a friend’s mother took her and on weekends she set her alarm for 3.15am and rode her bike 9km. She remembers the day her mother came outside in a pink nightie and, unsuccessfully, tried to stop her peddling off in the dark. McCardel feared she’d be in trouble when she got home. “Instead, my Dad’s like, ‘Right, we’re going to buy you some lights.’” But McCardel’s times weren’t fast enough to get her into the national championships in the open category and her parents encouraged her to quit swimming to concentrate on her final two years of study. After school, she went to Monash University to do an arts degree. At some point, though, she had decided she wanted to be “the best in the world at something”. She tried triathlon but failed to reach an elite level. She did well in the Melbourne marathon and started to think that distance might be where she could be the best. In 2007, she did a marathon swim, 11.3km between Frankston and Mornington. “It was so wild and free … I had this beautiful connection with the water.” About midway through the swim she was smashing the field – the first woman, with only one man ahead of her. “I just knew at that moment that I could be the best in the world at marathon swimming.” She came second, after the male swimmer. Chloë McCardel’s swimming career has not made her money. Most of her income comes from coaching others to swim the Channel and motivational speaking. (As a survivor of domestic violence, she also advocates for the criminalisation of coercive control.) Ahead of every swim, she runs fundraisers. But the goal is the thing that pulls her forward: “I set scary goals and then I’m so petrified I get out of bed in the morning.” She has set herself another scary goal: in 2022 she wants to be the first person in history to swim the 92km from England to Belgium through the stormy, frigid waters of the North Sea. “The idea is to get to the other end before I die. And if I don’t end up in intensive care, it’s a bonus.” The Bondi surf that is making me panicky is like a soak in a bath for McCardel. She strokes back towards me and, with no small amount of embarrassment, I tell her that I think we should grab a coffee instead. No dramas, she says as we reach the sand. As we towel off, she adds: “I don’t even like waves.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,"‘If I don’t end up in intensive care, it’s a bonus’: the beauty and pain of being the world’s best endurance swimmer",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/26/if-i-dont-end-up-in-intensive-care-its-a-bonus-the-beauty-and-pain-of-being-the-worlds-best-endurance-swimmer
