4/12/2022,"Victoria will host the 2026 Commonwealth Games, the premier, Daniel Andrews has announced. The opening ceremony will be held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground while the games will largely be based in regional Victoria. Ballarat, Bendigo, Geelong and Gippsland will each host their own athlete’s village and sport programs, and Shepparton is also expected to hold sporting and cultural events. Andrews thanked Commonwealth Games authorities for the accepting the bid, which was first to propose a predominately regional event. “It is different,” Andrews said in Ballarat. “I’m sure from their point of view, it’s a bit riskier than just running it in the middle of a large city. “But to do this and to do it well and we will … [it’s] an opportunity like no other.” The government will invest in community infrastructure, including housing and world-class sports facilities that Andrews said would become a “lasting legacy” and attract future events. He said the games will contribute more than $3bn to Victoria’s economy, creating more than 600 full-time jobs before the games, 3,900 jobs during and a further 3,000 jobs after it ends. The cost of running the event has yet to be revealed, but Andrews described it as an “investment”. An initial 16 sports have been put forward for the event, with further sports to be added later this year. Ballarat will host athletics and boxing; Bendigo will be home to lawn bowls, netball, squash and weightlifting; Gippsland will have badminton and cycling; and Geelong will host beach volleyball, diving, gymnastic, hockey, table tennis and triathlon events. T20 cricket will also be played across the four regional hubs. Commonwealth Games Federation president, Louise Martin, said Commonwealth Games Australia and the Victorian government set out a “bold and innovative vision” for the event. “In Victoria, we believe we have found the perfect partner for the next stage of our journey,” Martin said in a statement. “This is a very special moment for the commonwealth sport family and on behalf of the entire movement, I would like to congratulate Commonwealth Games Australia and Victoria on their successful games submission. “We now look forward to a bright future as we work together to stage a Commonwealth Games like no other.” Commonwealth Games Australia president, Ben Houston, said the home games will provide “immeasurable benefits” for athletes in the lead up to the 2032 Brisbane Olympic and Paralympic Games, describing them as “three home games” for athletes in six years. Houston also pointed to upcoming international basketball, cycling, football and rugby events being hosted in Australia. “It will be a ‘green and gold’ festival for a decade,” Houston said. The Australian Olympic Committee chief executive, Matt Carroll, agreed. “With Brisbane hosting the 2032 Olympic Games, we now have a second major home Games in prospect,” Carroll said. “The Olympic and Commonwealth Games share so many member sports.” Victoria’s opposition leader, Matthew Guy, said hosting the Commonwealth Games outside Melbourne is “outstanding” for the regional parts of the state. “The whole concept, the whole initiative has the support of the Liberal and National parties” he said. “The Commonwealth Games is a great idea for country and regional Victoria. It’s one I’m pleased to say has bipartisan support.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The announcement comes after reports the Commonwealth Games Federation was struggling to find a host for the 2026 games. D​​urban, South Africa, was stripped of the right to stage the 2022 Commonwealth Games due to financial issues and was replaced by Birmingham, England, which was originally scheduled as 2026 host, leaving a vacancy. Perth withdrew from the process earlier this year, with the Western Australian government citing the uncertainty posed by the Covid-19 pandemic and at least $1bn of investment required to establish the required infrastructure. Kuala Lumpur, Cardiff, Calgary, Edmonton and Adelaide had all earlier withdrawn from proposed bids. Tasmania formally requested Hobart and Launceston be considered as host or co-host for the event but they were unsuccessful.",News/Australia news,Regional Victoria announced as host of 2026 Commonwealth Games,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/12/regional-victoria-announced-as-host-of-2026-commonwealth-games
4/12/2022,"Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy voiced concerns that Russian forces could use chemical weapons in Ukraine but did not confirm whether they had been used in his daily video address late on Monday. “Today, the occupiers issued a new statement, which testifies to their preparation for a new stage of terror against Ukraine and our defenders,” he said. “One of the mouthpieces of the occupiers stated that they could use chemical weapons against the defenders of Mariupol. We take this as seriously as possible.” Earlier on Monday evening, Ukrainian authorities claimed Russia dropped a drone carrying a toxic substance on the south-eastern city of Mariupol. Ivanna Klympush, a Ukrainian MP and chair of the parliamentary committee on integration of Ukraine to the EU, said the unknown substance was “most likely” chemical weapons. The reports are so far unconfirmed. The Ukrainian Azov Regiment, a unit of the National Guard of Ukraine, accused Russia of using chemical weapons of an “unknown origin”, dropped via an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) on civilians in Mariupol. Azov leader Andriy Biletsky told the Kyiv Independent that three people had signs of chemical poisoning but there appears to be no “disastrous consequences” for their health. UK foreign secretary Liz Truss said work was underway to verify details of the alleged attack, adding: “Any use of such weapons would be a callous escalation in this conflict and we will hold Putin and his regime to account.” Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby added that he was aware of the reports but “cannot confirm at this time”. More than 10,000 civilians have died in Mariupol, the city’s mayor has said. Vadym Boychenko said the death toll could surpass 20,000, as weeks of attacks and privation leave bodies “carpeted through the streets” in an interview with the Associated Press. Zelenskiy partly blamed the Ukrainian loss of life on western nations that had not sent weapons to bolster the war effort. “Unfortunately, we are not getting as much as we need to end this war sooner,” he said. “Time is being lost. The lives of Ukrainians are being lost … And this is also the responsibility of those who still keep the weapons Ukraine needs in their armoury.” Ukrainian authorities are warning people not to go near what they say are landmines being dropped on Kharkiv. Zelenskiy also spoke of “hundreds of thousands of dangerous objects” including mines and unexploded shells left by Russian forces in regions in Ukraine’s north. The gruesome task of exhuming the bodies of Ukrainian victims from mass graves in Bucha on the outskirts of Kyiv started on Monday. More than 5,800 cases of alleged war crimes against Russian forces are under investigation, Iryna Venediktova, Ukraine’s prosecutor general, told CNN. Nearly two-thirds of all Ukrainian children have fled their homes in the six weeks since Russia’s invasion, and the UN has verified the deaths of 142 children, though the number is almost certainly much higher, the UN children’s agency said Monday. The United Nations has increasingly heard accounts of rape and sexual violence in Ukraine and called for an investigation into violence against women and increased protection for Ukrainian children. Sima Bahous, UN Women executive director, told the UN security council: “The combination of mass displacement with the large pressure results of conscripts and mercenaries and the brutality displayed against Ukrainian civilians has raised all red flags.” Ukraine’s ombudswoman for human rights said she had recorded horrific acts of sexual violence by Russian troops in Bucha and elsewhere, including a case in which women and girls were kept in a basement for 25 days, the New York Times reported. Nine of those victims are now pregnant, according to the ombudswoman, Lyudmyla Denisova. Three people were killed and eight civilians wounded by Russian strikes in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, the region’s governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. Ukraine’s eastern city of Kharkiv came under heavy shelling on Monday, resulting in multiple casualties, mayor Ihor Terekhov said. Among the casualties in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, was the death of one child, the region’s mayor said. Prominent Russian opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza Jr has been detained in Moscow on charges of disobeying police orders, his lawyer told the independent news outlet Sota Vision on Monday evening. France’s foreign ministry has declared six more Russian agents “operating under diplomatic cover” as persona non grata. The six agents are being accused of working against France’s “national interest” after an investigation, Reuters reports. Russian forces are focusing on the Donbas region, the US Pentagon said, but have not launched an offensive yet. “They’re repositioning, they’re refocusing on the Donbas,” Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby told reporters. Western officials said they expected Russia to try to “double or perhaps even treble” its forces in Donbas as it shifts forces from Kyiv and elsewhere in the coming weeks. The Austrian chancellor, Karl Nehammer, held “direct, open and tough” talks with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in Moscow on Monday. In a statement, Nehammer – the first EU leader to meet with Putin since he ordered his troops to invade Ukraine – was quoted as saying that it was “not a friendly meeting”.",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 48 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/12/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-48-of-the-invasion
