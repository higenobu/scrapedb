1/22/2022,"Wealthy clients and oligarchs from autocratic countries are using prestigious London law firms to intimidate and silence journalists, MPs have warned. A cross-party group of MPs called on ministers to introduce legislation to prevent deep-pocketed individuals and powerful corporations from misusing the legal system to “intimidate and destroy” reporters.  Speaking in a debate in the House of Commons on Thursday, the MPs urged the government to better protect the media and citizens from abusive legal action known as “strategic lawsuits against public participation”, or Slapps. Lawyers and campaigners describe Slapps as a form of legal harassment that exploits lengthy and expensive legal procedures to silence journalists, critics and watchdogs. David Davis, a Conservative MP and former cabinet minister, said that “nefarious” actors were using the justice system “to threaten, intimidate and put the fear of God into British journalists, citizens, officials and media organisations”. Davis described such tactics as “lawfare” and cited recent examples where reporters have faced “reputational and financial ruin in defending themselves from these malevolent cases”. The MPs drew particular attention to the work of a series of elite English law firms that specialise in bringing cases against the media. Davis said: “It is very clear that some London-based law firms have found an incredibly profitable niche that they are willing to pursue without too much concern about the outcome. I think the professional bodies for those law firms should be looking very hard at them, as should the government.” Another Tory MP, Bob Seely, said the UK has a “cottage industry of lawfare”: “If we allow the cancer of the selling of intimidation services by high-end legal firms, it will not do us any good in the long run, just as in the long run letting mafias launder money would also be bad for us.” He added: “We need to bring in anti-Slapp legislation, and we need to go after those lawyers – dare I call them slappers – who use such tactics.” The MPs highlighted recent cases brought against investigative journalists including the Financial Times reporter Tom Burgis, who is the subject of libel actions brought by Kazakh mining company ENRC, and Catherine Belton, the author of a recent book about Vladimir Putin, who last year faced a barrage of libel actions brought by multiple Russian billionaires and the state-controlled oil company Rosneft. Two MPs, Seely and Labour’s Liam Byrne, criticised English firms including Mishcon de Reya, Schillings, Harbottle & Lewis, CMS and Carter-Ruck. Sir Robert Neill, who chairs the Commons justice select committee, said he hoped ministers would consider anti-Slapp legislation but told MPs that “there are very significant regulations relating to the conduct of law firms in the United Kingdom”. “We should not mischaracterise the position by saying that there is a high level of cynicism in the legal profession; there is not, and I do not believe that there is a failure of regulation either,” he added. Responding to the debate, the justice minister, James Cartlidge, agreed that Slapps actions “represent an abuse of the legal system”, but said the government “must be cautious to respond to Slapps in a proportionate way that continues our tradition of balancing individual rights with the public good”. Contacted for comment, a spokesperson for Mishcon de Reya said any suggestion that the firm participates in Slapps or otherwise oppressive or intimidating litigation would be wrong and defamatory. Schillings, CMS, Harbottle & Lewis and Carter-Ruck did not respond to a request for comment.",News/Media,"Oligarchs use London law firms to intimidate journalists, MPs say",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/21/oligarchs-use-london-law-firms-to-intimidate-journalists-mps-say

I wouldn’t have gone near a marmalade version when I was younger, but that tangy bitterness is a taste I’m glad to have since acquired. Hot custard really is the best sidekick for this, so don’t hold back.  Prep 30 minCook 50 minServes 6-8 45g cold unsalted butter, diced, plus extra for greasing2 tbsp demerara sugar210g plain flour, plus extra for dusting2 tsp baking powder50g caster sugarZest of 1 orangeA pinch of salt60g suet (or vegetarian suet)110ml milk220g marmalade Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Put a roasting tray on the bottom shelf of the oven and half-fill it with hot water. Take a large sheet of foil and lay a sheet of baking paper on top of it. Grease the paper with butter, then sprinkle the demerara sugar over the top and set aside. Put the flour, baking powder, caster sugar, orange zest and salt in a bowl. Add the butter and use your fingertips to rub it into the flour until the mixture looks like coarse breadcrumbs. Stir in the suet. Make a well in the centre, pour in the milk, then use a table knife to stir the mix until it comes together into a soft dough. Turn out on to a lightly floured surface and give it a brief knead to bring it together. Roll the dough into a roughy 25cm x 30cm rectangleand spread the marmalade on top, leaving a little border around the edges. Starting from one shorter side of the rectangle, roll up the dough like a swiss roll, then pinch both ends to seal and carefully lift and place seam side down on top of the buttered baking paper. Wrap up the roly-poly in the paper and foil, and twist the ends like a cracker to seal; don’t wrap it too tightly, though, because the pudding will expand as it cooks. Put the wrapped roly-poly directly on the oven shelf above the roasting tin and bake for 50-55 minutes, until firm; don’t worry if some of the marmalade leaks out. Remove and leave to cool for five minutes, then unwrap, sliceg and serve with hot custard.

1/22/2022,"Last month, it was announced that rail fares would rise in March – again. But why are UK train tickets so expensive? I asked Cat Hobbs, the founder of We Own It, a group campaigning for public ownership of the railways. I recently got married in Scotland, and it took eight hours to drive my bickering family up there. It was cheaper to do that – and pay for the therapy afterwards – than all take the train. Why do some experts say our trains are cheap?Some of our advance tickets are cheap, but our walk-on fares are expensive. A ticket from London Paddington to Bristol in 1995 was £28.50. If the price had increased with inflation, it would be double – but it can go as high as £115. The 2011 McNulty report found that the UK’s fares cost roughly 30% more than those of other railways in Europe. And our government is obsessed with passengers footing the bill.  The government is quite ideologically driven …Absolutely. Rail is a natural monopoly. When you’re standing on a platform, you don’t have consumer choice. We need profits reinvested. The rolling stock companies are a scandal. Rolling what?Rolling stock companies own the physical trains and lend their “sets” out to operators. During the pandemic, rolling stock companies have paid out a billion pounds to their shareholders. Why are our costs so high?It’s the mess of our system: too many companies, arguing over who should be fined if a train is late. And the government refuses to invest properly. At one point during the pandemic, passenger numbers dropped to 1872 levels. The numbers haven’t recovered, but the government’s talking about cutting rail spending. Train travel is already unreliable; it will get worse. Do British passengers effectively subsidise European rail travel?Yes. Ironically, some companies introduced through privatisation are state owned. So Arriva is owned by the German state and Abellio the Dutch. They make a profit in Britain and return it to their own countries’ railways. You know, when I get interviewed, people always ask about the soggy sandwiches of British Rail. Wait, we had sandwiches on trains? So cool! Sorry to be the 90s kid, but the only sandwich on my trains is a half-eaten Pret …I only remember British Rail a little, certainly not enough to assess the sandwiches, but it was chronically underfunded. Since then, the government’s actually increased railway spend but it’s been flowing into the pockets of shareholders. If we had a spare billion, I’m sure we could do better sandwiches. The public want the railway back, right?Yes – 64% of us do, and the majority of Conservative voters. Boris Johnson is talking about rail reform – they’re calling the replacement for Network Rail “Great British Railways” – but it’s the same privatised system repackaged. Let me guess, a shiny new logo?There is! The government will be in charge of planning, but it’ll still be private companies implementing it, and they’ll sent profits to shareholders. And if they don’t make any profit, the government will bail them out. Private companies want steady revenue, they don’t want to innovate.

1/22/2022,"With every new day in the tennis world, the rise of Carlos Alcaraz becomes even more inevitable. He is the youngest player in the top 100, the youngest to win 30 matches in a season since Rafael Nadal many moons ago, and during last year’s breakout season he became the youngest US Open quarter-finalist in the Open era, winning a title and earning his first grand slam seeding for good measure. But on Friday evening, after four long and exhausting hours of play, Matteo Berrettini, the seventh seed, played the role of a seasoned veteran as he drew on every inch of his growing wealth of experience to delay the Spaniard for at least one more tournament.  Berrettini had led by two sets, only to see his lead crumble before an 18 year-old who played without fear or favour, but he eventually recovered to defeat Alcaraz 6-2, 7-6 (3), 4-6, 2-6, 7-6 (5). On Friday night, Rafael Nadal also reached the fourth round in far less complicated circumstances after he defeated Karen Khachanov, the 28th seed, 6-3, 6-2, 3-6, 6-1. “I was telling myself that the guy that would have won the match was the guy that wanted it more. So I guess I wanted it more,” said Berrettini. “But this is just a sentence I was telling myself to feel ready, and I think in the end it’s about fighting and trying and do the right things. I really fought hard. That’s what I think made the difference.” Alcaraz, seeded 31st, has already established himself as one of the brightest young players in the game, boasting athleticism, dynamic weapons and relentless competitiveness. The homework for Alcaraz in the off-season was to improve his serve, one of the obvious weaker points in his game, and to continue working on his physicality. He has indeed started the season placing his serve far better and the sleeveless shirt he opted to wear in Australia just so happens to demonstrate the clear physical gains he has made. It was the youngster who soared early, seizing control of points with his forehand and suffocating Berrettini in his early service games. He generated five break points early in the opening set, but Berrettini matched them with excellent serving. Alcaraz’s commitment to dominating with his forehand soon became his weakness as he over-pressed and sprayed errors as Berrettini moved towards a two set lead. “I was feeling confident. In the third, there were a couple of games I was 0-30 and I felt the momentum was on my side, and then tennis,” he said, clicking his fingers. “It’s like this.” Alcaraz worked his way back into the match by demonstrating his improved serve, finding his feet through increasingly smooth holds. Then he began to overwhelm Berrettini by pinning the Italian into his backhand corner and forehand winners. He finished with 23 forehand winners in total, 12 more than the Italian. A brilliant final set filled with effective serving and one sublime hold from Alcaraz, saving a match point at 5-6, followed. They convened in a final set super tiebreak, where Berrettini’s composure, experience and supreme serving finally made a difference. As he burst ahead and never looked back, Alcaraz double faulted on match point. “I’m very proud of the performance today,” said Alcaraz. “I mean, it was my first time two sets down, and then be able to come back like the way I did. I gave everything on the court, so that’s the thing that I want to do, give everything on the court and I’m very proud the way that I did.” Berrettini, meanwhile, only had many positive words for his young opponent: “He’s unbelievable,” he said. “I think at his age I didn’t even have an ATP point. He’s impressive, he can only improve playing matches like this. He showed everybody his potential. Luckily today I won but, really, congrats to him.” The veteran on Friday, at 25 years old Berrettini is young himself and part of a generation still just settling at the top of the sport. His own pathway remains unique. When the likes of Alexander Zverev and Andrey Rublev sped up towards the top of the game from their youth, Berrettini took his time and slowly caught up. While his limitations are more glaring than some, his backhand in particular, he makes up for it with his steadfast commitment to nurturing his strengths; serve, forehand, backhand slice. He remains a contender in Melbourne. As the youngest player in the men’s draw narrowly lost, the second oldest, also a Spaniard, kept himself in the fight. Nadal faced his first top 50 opponent since his six-month injury layoff and he passed another test in his comeback, defeating Khachanov in four sets to reach the fourth round.",Sport/Sport,Carlos Alcaraz continues to impress despite loss to Matteo Berrettini,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/21/carlos-alcaraz-continues-to-impress-despite-loss-to-matteo-berrettini
1/22/2022,"Anecdotal reports of Covid reinfection in the UK are growing, including people testing positive just weeks apart in December and January, or having had the virus three or even four times. Children are also being seen with reinfections. We take a look at the science behind catching Covid multiple times.  Reinfection figures tend to refer to the detection of a second, or subsequent, Covid infection, regardless of the variant involved. The risk of reinfection is likely to depend on a range of factors: for example, data suggests it is higher in unvaccinated people and potentially in those whose previous infection was more mild with a lower immune response. It also depends on the variant – one expert said the risk of reinfection with Omicron soon after a first Omicron infection would be lower than Delta followed by Omicron – and how long ago someone was vaccinated. Experts say the dose to which someone is exposed may also be important. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) uses the definition of a possible reinfection as a case 90 days or more after a previous confirmed Covid infection, in part because it excludes those who simply shed the virus for longer after infection. According to the latest figures for England from the UKHSA, from the start of the pandemic up to 9 January this year there were 425,890 possible reinfections, with 109,936 found in the week ending 9 January, accounting for almost 11% of all cases that week. Very few possible reinfections are “confirmed” as that requires genetic sequencing. What’s more, with few people in the community having access to tests in the first wave, many first infections may not have been counted. “With the combination of being two years into the pandemic, a few rounds of antibody waning, two major waves of immune evasion by Delta and then Omicron, there’s fairly rampant reinfection,” said Prof Danny Altmann, a professor of immunology at Imperial College London. In short, yes. According to scientists at Imperial College London, after taking into account a host of factors Omicron was associated with somewhere between a 4.38 and 6.63-fold higher risk of reinfection, compared with Delta. The team add that this means protection against catching Covid, arising from a previous infection within the past six months, has fallen from about 85%, before Omicron turned up, to somewhere between 0% and 27%. The drop is not surprising given that Omicron has been found to have the ability to dodge the body’s immune responses to a significant degree. Potentially, yes. UKHSA data shows that for cases with a specimen date between 1 November and 29 December 2021 there were 2,855 probable reinfections 29 to 89 days after a previous infection – although some of these may reflect ongoing detection from an initial infection. While the UKHSA notes it is difficult to directly compare the situation between variants – as there are many important changing factors at play, including overall levels of immunity in the population – Omicron’s immunity-dodging powers are likely to play a role in these reinfections. It is not yet clear how well immune responses to Omicron protect against a second Omicron infection, or infections with new variants. “I would expect the risk of a second Omicron infection is a lot lower than the risk of Omicron following Delta after all you have developed antibodies to the actual Omicron spike protein,” said Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia. That could well be due to different variants: according to data from the Office for National Statistics released in December, school-age children with Covid at that time were much less likely to have Omicron than Covid-positive adults. In other words, a previous recent infection could well have been Delta, while their latest is Omicron. A UKHSA spokesperson said: “Data shows that those testing positive for coronavirus between 29 and 89 days of a prior infection accounts for a small proportion of all reinfections. Many of these shorter interval reinfections are likely to be school-age children because they had the highest levels of infection in September and October, just before Omicron emerged.” That may seem logical given the body’s prior immune response, and Hunter notes data suggests the viral load in reinfections is lower than in primary infections, suggesting the disease may, in general, be less severe. However, the severity of a reinfection depends on many factors, including the variant involved and a person’s vaccination status. ONS data suggests that when the Alpha variant became dominant, symptoms were less common for reinfections – but this reversed when Delta became dominant. When Omicron became dominant, data suggests people were just as likely to have Covid symptoms in their second infection as their first infection. “There’s no shortage of reinfections, some pretty severe, although not requiring hospitalisations,” said Altmann. Among those who have had Covid twice are the politicians Kier Starmer and Matt Hancock, while there have also been reports of people having a Covid infection three or even four times, some just a few weeks apart. The UKHSA do not break down reinfections by episode, although they have identified some possible third reinfections. What is clear is that the longer Covid is with us, the more reinfections a person may potentially experience.",News/World news,Covid reinfection: how likely are you to catch virus multiple times?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/21/covid-reinfection-how-likely-are-you-to-catch-virus-multiple-times

1/22/2022,"It should have been perfect flying weather when Zara Rutherford set off from Palo Alto in California for Seattle, a month into her attempt to become the first woman to fly solo round the world. But while the skies were clear, wildfires were raging on the ground. She tried to avoid the towering plumes of acrid smoke by climbing to 12,000ft, but to no avail. “I couldn’t see in front of me,” she said. “It was all kind of a brownish, smoky, orange, dirty colour. I could smell the smoke as well, which was quite unpleasant.”  By the time she was enveloped in smoke and could no longer see the ground from her plane, she realised she would have to turn back. She was only in the smoke for a few seconds, but it felt “like for ever, especially because the turbulence went from zero to everything very quickly.” The incident was just one of many heart-stopping moments on Rutherford’s record-breaking journey, which took in 31 countries over five continents and ended on Thursday. “I am really happy. I think it’s finally kicking in,” the 19-year-old said in a Zoom interview from her home outside Brussels. Phones were pinging and the Rutherford cats miaowed as she was momentarily interrupted by a luxuriously furred grey tabby who hogged the screen. The domestic calm was a far cry from the Belgian-British teenager’s 155-day odyssey, which took in some of the coldest, smoggiest and wettest places on earth, all experienced in a two-seater Shark microlight, a plane so easy to manoeuvre that one person can push it along the runway. The flip side of the plane’s carbon-fibre ultra-lightness is its susceptibility to severe turbulence. Flying over Bulgarian mountains a week ago, the turbulence was so severe it triggered a G-force warning that Rutherford described in her typically understated way as “very uncomfortable”. Even on the final hop from Frankfurt to Kortrijk in western Belgium on Thursday, she hit her head on the canopy. Her journey started in August in Belgium, from where she headed west over the UK to the Americas via Greenland and on to Russia, then down to south-east Asia, looping north over India, the Middle East and finally back to Europe. Rutherford, who was first taken up in small planes by her pilot parents when she was a toddler, gained her flying licence at 17. But temperate Belgium had not prepared her for the extreme conditions she would encounter on her epic trip. One of her most daunting tasks was flying over Siberia. “It is beautiful but it is intimidating … The ocean is frozen at this time of year. There are no trees, there are no people, no roads, no electricity cables. In terms of wilderness there is nothing quite like it.” The flight over the snowy vastness was nerve-racking because she knew if her engine were to fail, there would be a long wait for rescue. “Spending hours in -35C, I don’t know if that’s achievable really, and I didn’t have quite the survival gear needed to spend hours and hours outside.” Unable to fly at night or in clouds, she was often racing against time – and the weather. Rather than dwell on what might happen, she concentrated on flying her plane: “It’s about living in the present; the next five, 10 minutes, rather than the next four hours, because in four hours the weather can change.” Music helped her stay focused in the cockpit. She set off with “a huge playlist” of pop songs from 2010 to 2019. Her tunes also eased the culture shock of being far from home. “It was good to have things I was familiar with, because especially in Siberia, Saudi Arabia and most of Asia, everything was so different, the culture, the climate the people – everyone was very generous and very kind, but I felt so, so far away from home, so having music I could sing along to was really helpful.” Avoiding bad weather meant she often had to change her plans. A thunderstorm prevented her from landing in Jakarta, forcing a diversion to the small domestic airport at Ketapang on the island of Borneo. As the terminal had no immigration office, she had to stay in the airport for two days – “the people were very generous [and] I got some very good local food”. The young pilot is aware of the environmental impact of her journey. She had hoped to make the trip in an electric plane, but found that wasn’t possible and said her plane used far less fuel than a commercial jet. “For my whole trip around the world it uses the same amount of fuel as a Boeing does in about 10 minutes, so although it has a negative impact, it’s not as big as it seems at first glance. And I was also doing some carbon offsetting.” Rutherford, who plans to study electrical engineering in the UK or the US, thinks she could be involved in making aviation greener. “Right now obviously aviation is not sustainable whatsoever, but it is heading in that direction.” More immediately she hopes her trip will inspire women and girls to fly planes and study science, engineering, technology and mathematics. “Aviation is a very big industry and it’s not going anywhere. As we go towards electric aircraft, we will continue to need pilots, so I am hoping to get more women involved.”",News/World news,"Wilderness, wildfires and pop music: how Zara Rutherford flew into record books",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/21/wilderness-wildfires-and-pop-music-how-zara-rutherford-flew-into-record-books
1/22/2022,"Boris Johnson has told schools in England to end the wearing of face masks by pupils, overriding headteachers’ concerns and plans by the education secretary to liaise with public health officials over masks during local outbreaks. Johnson’s demand to “follow the latest guidance”, made through his No 10 spokesperson, came after headteachers at secondary schools across England said they would encourage their students to keep wearing masks despite the government withdrawing advice for them to be worn in classrooms.  The prime minister’s spokesperson said: “Children have been one of the hardest hit as a result of the disruption throughout the pandemic and we recognise the impact it has had on their education. The prime minister believes it is vital that children are receiving face-to-face education and can enjoy a normal experience in the classroom and the prime minister also thinks that the schools should follow the latest guidance. “We’ve been clear that we removed the requirement for face masks to be worn in classrooms and we will remove advice for face masks to be worn in communal areas from 27 January.” Johnson’s intervention is likely to further confuse the issue, with school leaders pointing out that official guidance from the Department for Education (DfE) specifies that masks can still be required in schools. The DfE’s advice to parents, updated on Thursday, states: “Your nursery, school or college might advise you that face coverings should temporarily be worn in communal areas or classrooms (by pupils, staff and visitors, unless exempt).” Meanwhile, the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, told Conservative MPs that he had agreed with directors of public health to consult with him over reintroducing face masks in schools in the event of “extraordinary” local outbreaks, “so that we can assess evidence and data to ensure any extra measures are proportionate”. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said “simplistic” statements from the government could jeopardise efforts to tackle outbreaks in schools. “No one want to see masks worn in schools for longer than is necessary. But it is important to remember that some schools are still dealing with very high levels of Covid in their communities, which is in turn leading to high levels of pupil and staff absence,” Whiteman said. “Schools will continue to work closely with their local public health directors to make sure that they are acting in line with public health advice. It is vital that the government continues to work closely with local public health teams so that schools receive clear and consistent messages. “Simplistic public messaging from the government really is not helping matters either. As the government’s latest guidance makes clear, Covid measures may vary between regions and local public health directors have been given authority to reintroduce face masks in communal spaces when they feel that is required. The government has a duty to be clear with parents on this.” Johnson’s comments steered clear of any threats against schools that retained mask wearing for pupils, with the DfE having no obvious legal powers to enforce its guidance. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “The government’s own guidance says that directors of public health may advise that face masks are needed in classrooms in response to local circumstances, but schools are unlikely to have had any time in which to consult them, or in which to communicate the changes with parents and staff. “It is therefore not surprising if some schools have continued to use face masks for the time being while they resolve these issues.”",News/Education,Boris Johnson tells schools in England to end mask-wearing policy,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/21/boris-johnson-tells-schools-england-end-mask-wearing-policy
