3/14/2022,"By Stephanie Kelly NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Sunday at the start of the session, extending last week's decline, as a U.S. official said Russia was showing signs it might be willing to have substantive negotiations over Ukraine. Brent crude futures fell $1.82, or 1.6%, to $110.85 a barrel by 6:47 p.m. ET (2247 GMT). WTI crude futures fell $2.41, or 2.2%, to $106.92 a barrel. Russia's invasion of Ukraine in late February, which Moscow calls a ""special operation,"" has roiled energy markets globally. Brent last week was down 4.8% after hitting $139.13 on March 7. U.S. crude recorded a weekly drop of 5.7% after touching a high of $130.50 on March 7. Both contracts last touched those price peaks in 2008. [O/R] Investors have been concerned about a tighter oil market following Russia's action. Prices fell last week as traders assessed potential improvements to the supply outlook that has been disrupted by the Ukraine crisis. Russia is showing signs it might be willing to have substantive negotiations over Ukraine, even as Moscow is intent on ""destroying"" its neighbor, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said on Sunday. Russia-Ukraine talks are not taking place right now but will continue on Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying on Sunday by the RIA news agency. Peskov made the comments after Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said Ukraine and Russia were actively conducting talks on Sunday. Russia said on Sunday it was counting on China to help it withstand the economic blow from Western sanctions over the war in Ukraine, but the United States warned Beijing not to provide that lifeline. U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, who is due to meet with China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi in Rome on Monday, warned Beijing it would ""absolutely"" face consequences if it helped Moscow evade sweeping sanctions over the war in Ukraine.

 Russian officials have reportedly contacted Chinese counterparts about obtaining military equipment from the country amid Moscow's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. U.S. officials told The Washington Post and The New York Times of the potential arms deal but did not disclose any details on what type of weaponry had been requested by Russia. The Times reported that Moscow also requested additional economic support from Beijing, which has become a key ally as much of the world seeks to isolate Russia. A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington said they had ""never heard of"" the request for help from Moscow, per Reuters. National security adviser Jake Sullivan, who is planning to meet Chinese counterpart Yang Jiechi this week, warned China on Sunday against providing any material support to Russia to help it cope with global sanctions. ""We are communicating directly, privately to Beijing that there will absolutely be consequences for large-scale sanctions evasion efforts or support to Russia to backfill them,"" Sullivan told CNN. ""We will not allow that to go forward and allow there to be a lifeline to Russia from these economic sanctions from any country, anywhere in the world,"" he added. In a televised interview on Sunday, Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov shared that part of Russia's gold and foreign exchange reserves are in Chinese currency, according to the Post. ""We see what pressure is being exerted by Western countries on China in order to limit mutual trade,"" Siluanov said during his interview. ""But I think that our partnership with China will still allow us to maintain the cooperation that we have achieved and not only maintain but also increase it in an environment where Western markets are closing,"" he added. Since starting its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has been hit with escalating sanctions from Western powers, with the U.S. and the U.K. recently saying they will phase out Russian oil, natural gas and coal imports. Some officials have said that Russia is running low on some types of ammunition amid the ongoing crisis, the Post noted.  ""If Beijing is offering any type of military assistance to aid Moscow's war in Ukraine, the spillover effects on U.S.-China policy could be vast,"" former U.S. Indo-Pacific Command adviser Eric Sayers told the Post.
