2/16/2022,"“Move fast”, “build awesome things” and “live in the future” were among Meta’s new internal values introduced by Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday, as the company grapples with growing pains in its pivot towards virtual reality and the “metaverse”. Speaking at an all-hands meeting on Tuesday, the CEO unveiled a number of new slogans and internal branding changes at the company, previously called Facebook.  In a post shared to his own Facebook page, Zuckerberg said Meta was now “a metaverse company, building the future of social connection” rather than primarily a social media company. The company is also now calling its employees “metamates”, which according to one executive is a reference to the naval slogan “ship, shipmate, self”. Following the recent name change, Zuckerberg and that he wanted to recalibrate company policies and values – which had not been updated since 2007. He also encouraged workers to “focus on long-term impact” – perhaps a nod to investor concerns about immediate fallout from the pivot. “‘Focus on long-term impact’ emphasizes long-term thinking and encourages us to extend the timeline for the impact we have, rather than optimizing for near-term wins,” he wrote in his post. “We should take on the challenges that will be the most impactful, even if the full results won’t be seen for years.” The meeting comes as employees confront the company’s rapid shift away from the social media business it has spent decades building. Engineers at Instagram and Facebook have reportedly been encouraged to apply for jobs in the metaverse and artificial reality departments at the company, and Meta has hired thousands of new workers from rival companies such as Apple. Employees are not the only ones spooked by the changes: investors seem wary as well. Meta’s stocks took a historic plunge following its most recent earnings report, leading the company to lose more than $230bn in market value. But Zuckerberg has appeared to remain steadfast in his belief that the metaverse is a worthy venture, and has invested $10bn in the project already. In a recent earnings call, he assured investors: “I’m pleased with the momentum and the progress that we’ve made so far and I’m confident these are the right investments for us to focus on going forward.” Meta not only changed internal rules but also external branding. It said Tuesday it had rebranded the News Feed – one of its best-known products – changing the name to simply “Feed”. It also announced on Tuesday it had officially acquired Kustomer, a customer service management platform (the acquisition had been in the works since it was announced in November 2020). Starting today, our News Feed will now be known as ""Feed."" Happy scrolling! pic.twitter.com/T6rjO9qzFc The flurry of rebrands on Tuesday comes after Meta settled one of its many controversies this week – a decade-old class action lawsuit over the company’s use of “cookies” in 2010 and 2011 that tracked people online even after they logged off the Facebook platform. As part of the proposed settlement, which must still be approved by a judge, Meta has agreed to delete all the data it “wrongfully collected” during that period. The company, which posted profits of $39.37bn in 2021, will also pay $90m to users who filed a claim, after lawyer fees are deducted. “Reaching a settlement in this case, which is more than a decade old, is in the best interest of our community and our shareholders and we’re glad to move past this issue,” said a Meta spokesperson, Drew Pusateri, in a statement on Tuesday.

2/16/2022,"The proportion of patients who are intolerant to statins is far lower than previous estimates suggest, according to the world’s largest study of the issue. According to the British Heart Foundation, an estimated 7-8 million adults in the UK take statins, which reduce the risk of heart attack and strokes. However, concerns around side-effects mean some people reduce their dose or stop taking them altogether.  Previous studies have estimated that the prevalence of statin intolerance may be as high as 50%, but new research drawing on data from more than 4 million people suggests it is likely below 10%. Prof Maciej Banach of the Medical University of Łódź and the University of Zielona Góra in Poland, who led the work, said it had been known for some time that most cases of statin intolerance were down to patients’ expectations of side-effects as a result of information they had received from the internet, neighbours or other sources. While the new research supports this view, Banach said it also shed light on characteristics of people who may be at risk of statin intolerance. “Our analysis gives strong message for the physicians, that there are some risk factors and conditions that might increase the risk of statin intolerance that everyone should always take into account,” he said, adding that it could help to exclude other reasons for an apparent statin intolerance and help doctors to think about using alternative treatments or doses. Writing in the European Heart Journal, Banach and colleagues report how they analysed data from 4,143,517 patients worldwide across 176 studies, including about 200,000 participants across 112 randomised control trials. The team’s analysis involved several different definitions for statin intolerance, including symptoms bad enough for patients to stop taking the drugs, an inability to tolerate the drugs at the dose needed for their cardiovascular risk, or a rise in levels of certain biological molecules or muscle symptoms that come and go as the pills are started or stopped. The results showed a prevalence of 9.1% when a range of definitions were considered, and as low as 5.9% under some individual definitions. The team said statin intolerance was associated with a number of factors including being older, female, black or Asian, drinking alcohol, having diabetes, being obese, or taking certain medications such as calcium channel blockers. The study adds to a growing body of evidence that statins have few side-effects. Research published last year revealed that statins are generally not behind the muscle aches and pains that persuade some people to ditch the drugs, while other studies have found that patients experience the same or fewer side-effects from taking statins than from placebo pills. Riyaz Patel, a professor of cardiology at University College London and a consultant cardiologist at Barts Health NHS trust, who was not involved in the study, said one limitation was that the prevalence of side-effects differed between different types of studies. Indeed, while the prevalence of statin intolerance was almost 5% when randomised control trials alone were considered, it was 17% among observational studies. Prof Liam Smeeth, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the higher levels in observational studies were possibly because of biases or factors such as the “drucebo” effect, where people expect side-effects when taking a certain drug. The authors noted, however, it was also possible randomised control trials underestimated the prevalence by excluding certain patients. Nonetheless, Patel suggested the findings chimed with previous research. “Based on what we know about statin side-effects to date, the results are likely to be broadly valid, and indicate that we should not overestimate statin side-effects or be too quick to stop statins without due consideration,” he said. Smeeth suggested the results should offer reassurance. “It is a reality that statins can cause symptomatic side-effects that can be quite bad. But they are relatively rare,” he said, adding that the drugs would be well tolerated by the vast majority of people. “When you look at how effective and cheap [statins] are, reducing your risk of a heart attack by a third or more, it is a huge benefit.”",News/Society,"Less than 10% of patients intolerant to statins, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/16/less-than-10-percent-of-patients-intolerant-to-statins-study-finds
2/16/2022,"Disabled children and young people should get 20 minutes of exercise each day and strength and balance activity three times a week in the first ever physical activity guidelines released for them by the four chief medical officers in the UK. The recommendations, underpinned by research from Durham University, the University of Bristol and Disabilities Rights UK, note that the health and wellbeing benefits include stronger muscles and improved confidence.  While chief medical officers have previously issued physical activity guidelines for UK children and young people, it is the first time such recommendations have been made for those with disabilities. The chief medical officers, Sir Chris Whitty, Sir Michael McBride, Sir Gregor Smith and Sir Frank Atherton, said: “We are delighted to present this report and infographic which are an important step forward in addressing the gap in physical activity guidelines for disabled children and disabled young people. “We encourage schools, parents, carers and healthcare professionals to communicate and promote these guidelines across their wider professional networks to enable appropriate physical activity opportunities for disabled children and disabled young people in their communities.” Brett Smith, professor of disability and physical activity at Durham University, who led the work, said while many disabled children and young people wanted to be active, they and their parents often had questions, including whether it was safe for them to exercise and how much they should do. “They don’t have any guidance to say physical activity done at certain levels is really good for you. They need that reassurance that it’s good,” he said. Indeed, the evidence showed that physical activity could be just as beneficial for disabled children and young people as those who did not have a disability. But Smith said it was also crucial that disabled children and young people had access to spaces such as playgrounds and leisure facilities. “From a public health perspective, we can say x amount of physical activity is good for you or not, but until we have inclusive environments, until we have equality in those contexts, then children will always struggle, and their parents will always struggle to be able to do that,” he said. The new guidelines recommend that disabled children and young people aim for 120 to 180 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic activity a week, or 20 minutes a day, and engage in strength and balance-focused activities around three times a week. “We don’t have any evidence to make a minutes​ recommendation for strength and balance,” said Charlie Foster, professor of physical activity and public health at the University of Bristol, who was also involved in developing the guidelines. He said strength and balance-focused activities included dance, yoga and gymnastics. Foster added that, as for other groups of individuals, all movement mattered and all “bite-size chunks of activity” counted – a phrasing he said was preferred by the disabled children and young people involved in communicating the guidelines. Smith said that the participants stressed that while the amount of physical activity was a useful message, it was important to them to emphasise equality, inclusivity, fun and exploring what made them feel good. “The lesson they taught us [is] that public health resources and messages will have more impact if they are co-produced in genuine partnership with people with lived experience,” Foster said. He also suggested the approach could prove useful for other areas of public health, including the uptake of Covid vaccines. The guidelines did not break down recommendations by different impairment groups, not least because evidence specific to some groups was lacking. Instead the team said it was important for people to find what worked for them, and to tailor exercise to what they could do on that day – a point raised by the disabled children and young people themselves. The guidelines, said Smith, were important not only from a public health perspective, but also because they covered a group of individuals that were often forgotten. “If people have forgotten about the health disparities, the health inequalities are just perpetuated implicitly if not explicitly on that,” he said, adding that disabled people had often been overlooked during the Covid pandemic. “It’s just putting disabled people and disabled young people at the forefront of policy, at the forefront of our agenda, at the forefront of our thinking, because there are so many young disabled people in society,” he said.",News/Society,"Disabled children should exercise for 20 minutes a day, first UK guidelines say",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/16/disabled-children-should-exercise-for-20-minutes-a-day-first-uk-guidelines-say
2/16/2022,"The UK car industry has warned of a “growing regional divide” in the provision of electric car chargers, as it called for a new regulator to oversee legally binding targets for charger installation. The number of publicly available chargers has not grown fast enough to keep up with the soaring number of battery-powered electric cars on British roads, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), a lobby group. Public charger numbers rose by 82% between 2019 and 2021, but this pales in comparison with the 600% jump in the number of electric cars during the same period.  The disparity between the number of chargers and cars is growing faster in the north of England than in the south, the SMMT said. Unequal charger provision across the country has long been a concern for the industry and analysts, with fears that customers will be put off buying new electric vehicles if they do not have a place to charge them regularly. A third of the UK’s households – mainly in towns and cities – do not have their own dedicated parking space where a private charge point could be installed. Investors, led by the oil companies Shell and BP and the French energy company EDF, are pouring money into the public charger industry. Nevertheless, those investments have overwhelmingly targeted wealthier areas of the country, led by London, as well as rapid chargers for fast recharging on popular routes. The UK has more rapid chargers per electric vehicle than any other nation barring China, South Korea and Japan, the SMMT said. That has left some parts of the country underserved. Greater Manchester has only 17 chargers per 100,000 people, compared with 102 per 100,000 in London, according to data from ZapMap that are relied upon by the government. Scotland is the second best region for chargers per 100,000 people, with 52 – although they are spread over a vast geographical area. Northern Ireland is the worst, with only 18 per 100,000 people. Mike Hawes, the SMMT’s chief executive, said that “range anxiety” – the often misplaced fear that an electric car will not have enough battery capacity – had been replaced by “charge anxiety” – the fear that drivers would be unable to find an open charge point. The SMMT said the charger mandate should be overseen by a new regulator it nicknamed “Ofcharge”, which would also have powers to set pricing, minimum standards and ensure “social equity” in provision. That would accompany a zero-emission-vehicle (ZEV) mandate announced by the government in October. Under the mandate, details of which are yet to be confirmed, carmakers will be expected to sell a growing proportion of electric vehicles and vans every year. The mandate is expected to accelerate the UK’s transition to electric cars, but it could mean that manufacturers are not able to sell as many petrol and diesel cars, as well as hybrids that combine a battery with an internal combustion engine. Those cars are currently more profitable for carmakers, although the gap is expected to disappear in the coming years once factories are building electric cars at the same scale. Hawes said plans to ban the sale of cars and vans with internal combustion engines by 2035 “would put the UK ahead of every major market in the world”, but added that it “needs more than automotive investment”. He said: “With clear, equivalent targets and support for operators and local authorities that match consumer needs, government can ensure the UK has a chargepoint network that makes electric mobility a reality for all, cutting emissions, driving growth and supporting consumers across the UK.” Ben Nelmes, the head of policy and research at New AutoMotive, a thinktank focused on the transition to zero-emissions vehicles, said the ZEV mandate should not be conditional on charger numbers. “The rising issue we’ve seen with charge points isn’t the number of chargers available,” Nelmes said. “We need to create a nationwide charging system based on the needs of the drivers, but this issue should not prevent an ambitious zero-emission vehicle mandate from the UK government. This is the key to secure the UK’s net zero targets, as well as giving people more access to electric vehicles at a lower cost and with more model ranges available.”",News/Environment,Electric car charging points ‘spread too unequally across UK’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/16/electric-car-charging-points-spread-too-unequally-across-uk
2/16/2022,"A monumental masterpiece depicting a 17th-century naval battle in silk and wool that is so fragile it has not been seen in public for 22 years is the subject of an urgent crowdfunding appeal to complete its delicate conservation. Royal Museums Greenwich needs to raise an extra £15,000 from the public in the next 28 days to save the tapestry, which was commissioned by Charles II and designed by the father and son team Willem van de Velde the Elder and Younger.  The Burning of the Royal James at the Battle of Solebay, 28 May 1672, commemorates a naval battle fought off the Suffolk coast in the third Anglo-Dutch war. More than 160 ships and 55,000 men – including the Duke of York, who later became James II – took part. The tapestry depicts the Royal James engulfed in flames against a backdrop of delicately hued sea and sky, with tiny figures pitching themselves into the waves to escape the blazing ship. Cherubim battling with sea monsters decorate its borders, and a weavers’ mark has been woven into its galloon. But it has become structurally unstable due to age and its huge expanses of fragile silk weft, and the original vibrant colours have faded as a result of light damage. The first phase of conservation was completed last year when the tapestry was sent for cleaning in Belgium. It is now with specialist conservators in the UK with the aim of it being rehung at Royal Museums Greenwich next year. The tapestry has undergone about 350 hours of preparatory work to date, and conservators at Zenzie Tinker Conservation in Brighton have begun detailed repairs that will take until December. About £179,000 has been allocated to the project so far, but an additional £15,000 is needed for its final stages, including rehanging the tapestry in Greenwich. “This is a very complex tapestry to conserve,” said Zenzie Tinker. “It’s very finely and skilfully woven, with large expanses of silk. There is extraordinary colour, billowing clouds, cresting waves. If it was conserved badly, you’d lose all that detail.” Measuring almost 4 metres by 6 metres, it is the largest tapestry Tinker’s team has worked on. They have divided it into 20cm wide sections, each of which will take an average of 100 hours of painstaking and backbreaking work. The team has dyed wool in more than 60 shades to match the original tapestry, and is using a combination of fine cotton and polyester to replace silk that has degenerated. “We need this to last indefinitely. Silk is too shiny, and degrades too quickly,” said Tinker. Some earlier repairs, dating from the 18th and 19th centuries, need to be unpicked and rewoven. But almost all the original weaving will be preserved and reinforced. Hazel Arnott, the lead conservator on the tapestry, said the work was intensive, requiring regular breaks to avoid eye strain and muscular pain. Although there was a lot of consultation and planning among the three conservators working on the tapestry, she also liked to listen to audio books – currently Anthony Trollope – while stitching. The £15,000 appeal is being made through Art Happens with Art Fund, a crowdfunding platform for museums and galleries which sets a one-month deadline to raise money.",Arts/Culture,UK museum in urgent appeal for funds to finish repairs on 17th-century naval tapestry,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/16/uk-museum-urgent-appeal-funds-repairs-17th-century-naval-tapestry
2/16/2022,"Pep Guardiola declared Manchester City’s 5-0 demolition of Sporting the “dream result” but insisted his team can play even better after they emphatically put one foot into the Champions League quarter-finals. Guardiola praised his side’s ruthlessness as they emphatically put one foot into the Champions League quarter-finals – they scored five goals from six shots on target – but he insisted some players had underperformed. The result is City’s joint-biggest away win in the competition, matching their 5-0 victory at Steaua Bucharest in 2016-17.  “The result is a dream, but the performance we can do better,” Guardiola said. “I am absolutely more than delighted. We were so clinical when we arrived to the goal. We have a duty as a manager and team to analyse.” City made light work of breaching the best defence in Portugal, sailing into a four-goal lead inside 44 minutes but Bernardo Silva, who scored twice, said they were far from their best. “In the first half we weren’t that good,” he said. “We were a bit sloppy. You need some luck to score that many goals from few chances.” Riyad Mahrez opened the scoring from close range on seven minutes before Silva doubled their advantage with a stunning half-volley. Phil Foden scored City’s third and Silva added a fourth before the interval following a fine run by Raheem Sterling, who added a spectacular fifth after the break, curling in from the edge of the box. Silva also had a second‑half headed goal, which would have sealed his hat-trick, disallowed for offside. Guardiola said João Cancelo was among those guilty of losing possession and misplacing simple passes but was effusive in his praise of Silva, who took his tally to 10 goals for the season. “I always push him and say: ‘You need to score more goals.’ He has everything, the ability to score more and to score in his city that he loves, [he joined] from the rivals Benfica, I am pretty sure that he is happy. “Bernardo is unique. First as a person, his mum and dad have to be so proud because he’s a lovely, lovely person. He’s so generous whether he plays or doesn’t play. He doesn’t just play football, he understands the game. There are players that play good with the ball but he understands every action, like few in the world [do]. I hope he stays at Manchester City for many, many years but he and the club will decide.” City continue their Premier League title defence at home to Tottenham on Saturday. Sporting will visit the Etihad Stadium for the return leg on 9 March. Silva said: “There is still a job to do in Manchester. We cannot relax.”",Sport/Football,"‘We can do better,’ says Guardiola after Manchester City dismantle Sporting",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/15/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-sporting-lisbon-champions-league
