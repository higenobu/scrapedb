5/16/2022,"Cash serves a valuable purpose in many investment portfolios, but when the stock market dives, many investors turn to cash in a knee-jerk reaction to avoid losses. However, depending on the reason, moving all your investments from equities to cash may turn out to be a significant mistake. Even during a bear market, holding a cash-heavy portfolio may lose you more money than you realize. Instead, consider cash uses and allocate only a portion of your funds to this asset class. A financial advisor could help you rebalance your portfolio and select investments that align with your financial goals. Find a qualified advisor today. Three Reasons Why Cash Could Be a Losing Proposition In a situation where high inflation and increasing interest rates are the new norm, the value of your dollar decreases every day. That loss of purchasing power can add up significantly over time, and by not investing in defensive stocks or high-yield bonds, investors lose out on the opportunity to earn interest. According to investment firm Charles Schwab, a standard 3% rate of inflation would erode $100,000 in real purchasing power by 14% over five years. Over 10 years that purchasing power would fall 26% and over 20 years, $100,000 held in cash would only equal the power of $55,368. In this case, a portfolio consisting entirely of cash still loses value over time, even though the dollar amount appears to stay constant. Further undercutting an investor's earning potential are the current low interest rates for short-term investments. If an investor moves all funds into a regular savings account or a money market fund, going for cash and short-term bonds, the incoming higher bond yields will suppress the value of those less-volatile investments. Even then, short-term bonds often return more than just holding cash. As a result of market tumult, some investors may decide that pulling funds from riskier, growth assets and putting it all into cash can safeguard their money. But in doing so, these investors are surrendering potential opportunities for capital appreciation. How Much Cash Should You Hold Then? Even in its most conservative model portfolio, Charles Schwab only allocates 30% to cash investments. The remainder goes to 50% fixed-income securities and 20% still in stocks. In the 2021 World Wealth Report, Capgemini reports that the world's high-net-worth individuals allocated between 21-28% of their assets to cash in crisis years during the past two decades. 20-30% was allocated to fixed income, with another 20-30% held in stocks. If or when the economy heats up again, these cash reserves will help investors buy cheap homes, stocks and other assets. Famed billionaire investor Warren Buffett also believes that cash is vital for emergencies, and his company Berkshire Hathaway holds $144 billion in cash or cash equivalents even now. In his annual letter to shareholders, Buffett noted that he ""always keeps 80% of his assets in equities,"" and at the moment, he and his partner have not found any ""exciting"" deals for buying publicly traded shares. He says, while they ""have endured similar cash-heavy positions from time to time in the past, these positions…are never permanent."" Indeed, Schwab research indicates that the average bear market lasts 15 months with a cumulative loss of 38.4%. On the other hand, the average bull run lasts 6 years, delivering returns of over 200%. Given that bear market recoveries are often front loaded, perhaps ensuring you have enough cash to take advantage of those opportunities might be the best solution after all. Bottom Line Cash reserves are an important part of an investor's portfolio, but pivoting to holding all cash during a market downturn can prove to be a significant mistake. Inflation erodes the value of cash's purchasing power over time, and holding funds in cash often results in missing out on opportunities that could earn more as time goes on. Instead, retail investors could follow the lead of many other wealthy individuals and maintain a healthy cash reserve while still keeping some of their funds allocated to stocks. An average 20-30% of funds allocated to cash can allow investors to protect their investments from hefty market falls and have the cushion left over to buy when the economy rises in the future.

5/16/2022,"Investors are facing a confusing environment, with long- and short-term signals sending different messages. Inflation remains stubbornly high, above an 8% annualized rate, and the Federal Reserve has made it clear that additional interest rate hikes are in the offing. Stocks are well off their highs, and despite last Friday's gains, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq posted their sixth consecutive weekly loss. But there are positives, too. The 1Q22 earnings season gave an upbeat vibe, as more than three quarters of the S&P-listed companies reported positive earnings surprises. However, while corporate earnings are up for now, the purchasing managers index (PMI), a measure of inflation from the production side, is running at 11%, suggesting a higher rate of consumer inflation later in the year. So how do you find the next hot stock to buy in this environment? One way might be to screen for stocks that have been endorsed by analysts at major investment banks in particular, such as Wall Street banking giant Morgan Stanley. The firm’s stock analysts are showing their upbeat outlook by selecting the stocks they see as winners for the coming year – and winners with substantial upside, on the order of 60% or better. Using the TipRanks database, we’ve looked up three of these Morgan Stanley picks, to see what makes them stand out. SI-Bone, Inc. (SIBN) We’ll start in the healthcare industry, with SI-Bone, a medical tech and device company. SI-bone works in the field of sacroiliac joint pain and diagnosis, or the treatment of lower back problems where the spine connects to the pelvis. Musculoskeletal disorders of the sacropelvic region have a large impact on quality of life, an SI-Bone’s mission is to develop new surgical devices and procedures to solve these issues. The company’s lead product is the iFuse surgical implant system. This orthopedic implant device is designed for surgical procedures featuring smaller incisions and faster recovery times, and its triangular shape is proven to produce a more effective result in the patient’s recovery. SI-Bone saw significant pressure early in the year, when medical procedure deferments generally peaked. SI-Bone’s total deferments in January and February reached approximately 140 – but there were fewer than 20 in the month of March, indicating an acceleration of business. The company’s worldwide revenue grew 22% in Q1, to reach $20.4 million. This number included a gross profit of $18.2 million, for a gross margin of 89%. This compared favorably to the $16.8 million in revenue and $14.8 million profits from the same quarter last year. EPS, however, came in negative. The net loss of 37 cents per share was an improvement, however, over the 47-cent EPS loss in the year-ago quarter. SI-Bone finished Q1 with cash and short-term liquid assets, including inventory, of $208 million. Morgan Stanley analyst Drew Ranieri has a positive outlook for SI-Bone’s immediate future, writing: “While 1Q was in line with our expectations, the recovery trends exiting the quarter remain promising for the balance of 2022, and we see a positive setup for upside through the balance of the year if pandemic procedure pressures continue to abate. Broadly, our commercial inflection point thesis remains intact, and we believe this should become more visible as procedure recovery takes further hold through 2022."" To this end, Ranieri rates SIBN shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and his $22 price target implies a one-year upside of 76% for the year ahead. (To watch Ranieri’s track record, click here) Overall, there are 5 additional analyst reviews on this medtech firm, and they all agree with Morgan Stanley’s bullish take – for a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are selling for $12.50, and their $27.50 average price target indicates room for a 120% one-year upside potential. (See SIBN stock forecast on TipRanks) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) The next stock under Morgan Stanley's radar is Palo Alto Networks, a leader in the digital world’s security segment. The company offers its customers protection from malware attacks through state-of-the-art network firewall technology. Palo Alto’s product line allows customers to automate their online and network security operations, to secure cloud activities and applications, and even to home and small business networks with enterprise-grade security. Given the increasing importance of online security – both generally, and specifically in today’s work environment of increased remote and home office activity – it should come as no surprise that Palo Alto’s revenues and earnings are both up. At the top line, the company has seen increasing revenue numbers for the last two years; the most recent report, for fiscal 2Q22, showed 30% year-over-year revenue growth to $1.3 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was reported at $1.74 for the quarter, up 12% y/y. Looking ahead to the full fiscal year 2022, the company expects its total billings to reach between $6.8 billion and $6.8.5 billion. This would represent a y/y gain of 25% to 26%, and would support revenues in the range of $5.425 billion to $5.475 billion. For comparison, the top line in fiscal 2021 came to $4.256 billion. All of this adds up, in the view of Morgan Stanley’s Hamza Fodderwala, to a solid prospect for investors. Fodderwala writes of PANW, “Security remains a top priority due to rising cyber threats and is by far the most defensive area of spend within IT budgets), with Palo Alto Networks positioned as a top strategic vendor to capture more wallet share within a large installed base of nearly 60K customers. With durable topline growth plus a focus now on driving higher margins and capital return, we view PANW as one of the most attractive risk/reward opportunities in software.” In line with these bullish comments, Fodderwala rates PANW an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and sets a price target of $823 to suggests an upside potential of ~68% going forward into next year. (To watch Fodderwala’s track record, click here) This view is far from the only bullish take on Palo Alto Networks. The stock has no fewer than 23 Buy ratings on record, overwhelming the 2 Holds for a Strong Buy consensus view. The shares are selling for $491.01 and their average target of $656.88 implies an upside of ~34% from that level. (See PANW stock forecast on TipRanks) ZoomInfo Technologies (ZI) We’ll wrap up with another tech firm, ZoomInfo. This company offers a range of B2B services, through a cloud-based platform, that include sales and marketing, prospecting, demand generation, account management, data management, and custom data solutions. The company’s platform gives both marketers and sellers the tools they need for a comprehensive view of their business landscape, to shorten sales cycles and increase win rates. ZoomInfo already holds a strong position in its niche, but that has not prevented it from taking steps to expand its footprint. Early this month, ZoomInfo announce that it had acquired the digital marketing and branding platform Comparably, combining that company’s platform with ZoomInfo’s existing TalentOS. ZoomInfo did not disclose financial terms of the acquisition, which is expected to show a positive impact on the firm’s full-year 2022 results. On the same day as the Comparably announcement, ZoomInfo released its results for 1Q22. The company posted revenue of $241.7 million, up an impressive 58% year-over-year, and 18 cents per share in non-GAAP diluted earnings. That EPS result was flat sequentially, but up 38% from the year-ago quarter. The company had $125.9 million in unlevered free cash flow during the quarter. ZoomInfo expects revenue for this calendar year to reach $1.06 billion to $1.07 billion, an increase from the previous guidance of $1.01 billion to $1.02 billion. Management expects this revenue to generate between $435 million and $445 million in unlevered free cash flow for the year. 5-star analyst Keith Weiss, covering this stock for Morgan Stanley, writes of the company’s outlook: “We believe a higher level of investment to build out the platform capabilities is warranted in light of sustained momentum and large market opportunity... We see ZI as one of our top ideas into 2022, as the company continues to deliver near 50% organic growth supplemented with best-in-class profitability.” Acknowledging the company’s potential growth, Weiss rates ZI shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and his $81 price target suggests an upside of ~84% for the year ahead. (To watch Weiss’s track record, click here) Wall Street’s tech firms typically pick up a lot of analyst attention, and ZoomInfo has 14 recent reviews. These include 13 Buys and a single Hold, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares have an average price target of $71.08, suggesting ~61% upside from the current trading price of $44.03.

5/16/2022,"Where do millionaires keep their money? High net worth individuals put money into different classifications of financial and real assets, including stocks, mutual funds, retirement accounts and real estate. Most of the 20.27 million millionaires in the U.S. did not inherit their money; only about 20% inherited their money. More than two-thirds of all millionaires are entrepreneurs. Here are some of the places the genuinely rich keep their money. Whether you're a millionaire or not, a financial advisor can help you take significant steps toward achieving your goals. Cash and Cash Equivalents Many, and perhaps most, millionaires are frugal. If they spent their money, they would not have any to increase wealth. They spend on necessities and some luxuries, but they save and expect their entire families to do the same. Many millionaires keep a lot of their money in cash or highly liquid cash equivalents. They establish an emergency account before ever starting to invest. Millionaires bank differently than the rest of us. Any bank accounts they have are handled by a private banker who probably also manages their wealth. There is no standing in line at the teller's window. Studies indicate that millionaires may have, on average, as much as 25% of their money in cash. This is to offset any market downturns and to have cash available as insurance for their portfolio. Cash equivalents, financial instruments that are almost as liquid as cash. are popular investments for millionaires. Examples of cash equivalents are money market mutual funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and Treasury bills. Some millionaires keep their cash in Treasury bills that they keep rolling over and reinvesting. They liquidate them when they need the cash. Treasury bills are short-term notes issued by the U.S government to raise money. Treasury bills are usually purchased at a discount. When you sell them, the difference between the face value and selling price is your profit. Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, has a portfolio full of money market accounts and Treasury bills. Millionaires also have zero-balance accounts with private banks. They leave their money in cash and cash equivalents and they write checks on their zero-balance account. At the end of the business day, the private bank, as custodian of their various accounts, sells off enough liquid assets to settle up for that day. Millionaires don't worry about FDIC insurance. Their money is held in their name and not the name of the custodial private bank. Other millionaires have safe deposit boxes full of cash denominated in many different currencies. These safe deposit boxes are located all over the world and each currency is held in a country where transactions are conducted using that currency. Real Estate For more than 200 years, investing in real estate has been the most popular investment for millionaires to keep their money. During all these years, real estate investments have been the primary way millionaires have had of making and keeping their wealth. The trend started with buying a primary home and then other residences, usually for tenants. After buying some personal real estate, then they have started buying commercial real estate like office buildings, hotels, stadiums, bridges and more. Millionaires often have large real estate portfolios. Once they have established themselves as a buyer in the real estate market, real estate agents start bringing them deals and they find it easy to obtain financing. Large investors have many millions tied up in real estate. Real estate is not an investment to depend on for cash, but it is a lucrative investment in the long run and a tried and true investment for millionaires because they like passive income and find that real estate provides it. Stocks and Stock Funds Some millionaires are all about simplicity. They invest in index funds and dividend-paying stocks. They like the passive income from equity securities just like they like the passive rental income that real estate provides. They simply don't want to use their time managing investments. Ultra-rich investors may hold a controlling interest in one or more major companies. But, many millionaires hold a portfolio of only a few equity securities. Many may hold index funds since they earn decent returns and you don't have to spend time managing them. They also have low management fees and excellent diversification. Millionaires also like dividend-paying stocks for the passive income they provide. Of course, they are also interested in capital appreciation but, for some, that's less of a concern than generating current income. Private Equity and Hedge Funds Unless you are a multimillionaire, you may not participate in a hedge fund or buy into a private equity fund. Public equity is well known since its shares trade on stock exchanges. One of its advantages is its liquidity. You can readily liquidate your public equity or shares of stock. Private equity funds, on the other hand, generally gets their investments from large organizations like universities or pension funds. Investors of private equity funds have to be accredited investors with a certain net worth, usually at least $250,000. Accredited investors can be individuals as well as organizations, but they are defined by regulations. In other areas, private equity funds do not have to conform to as many regulations as public equity does. Some of the ultra-rich, if they are accredited investors, do invest in private equity. Hedge funds are not the same as private equity. Hedge funds use pooled funds and pursue several strategies to earn outsized returns for their investors. Hedge funds invest in whatever fund managers think will earn the highest short-term profits possible. Commodities Commodities, like gold, silver, mineral rights or cattle, to name a few, are also stores of value for millionaires. But they require storage and have a level of complexity that many millionaires simply don't want to deal with. Alternative Investments Some millionaires, along with the ultra-rich, keep a portion of their money in other alternative investments like such tangible assets as fine art, expensive musical instruments or rare books. Also, there are millionaires and the ultra-rich that have investments in intellectual property rights such as the rights to songs or movies. These can be very lucrative investments. Cryptocurrency It is estimated that there are around 100,000 cryptocurrency millionaires out there with the majority holding Bitcoin. To try to make your fortune in cryptocurrency, you have to be willing to take on some risk and many millionaires don't have an appetite for risk. You can take a small portion of a millionaire's wealth and invest in one of the different cryptocurrencies. Plenty of people have become millionaires this way. Some have lost their money. More and more, cryptocurrency is becoming accepted as a legitimate investment that deserves a look when trying to accumulate wealth. The Bottom Line Millionaires have many different investment philosophies, so it's difficult to generalize concerning where they keep their money. However, all of the above are legitimate investments for millionaires. They have a desire for a reduction of their risk, so many prefer diversified investment portfolios. More than one of these investments can be combined to try to enhance wealth. Tips on Investing Would you like to investigate how your investments are growing?

5/16/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- After one of the most dramatic weeks yet for ARK Investment Management, Wall Street can no longer have any doubts: Cathie Wood is sticking with her strategy -- and investors are sticking with her. Most Read from Bloomberg Goldman’s Blankfein Says US at 'Very, Very High Risk' of Recession $11 Trillion and Counting: Global Stock Slump May Not Be Over Whereabouts of Terra’s Bitcoin Reserve a Mystery After Transfers Terra Hasn’t Killed Crypto, But It Was a Narrow Escape Ukraine Latest: NATO Embraces Sweden, Finland; US Aid Vote Nears The chances of both have been questioned this year as a selloff in speculative tech stocks laid waste to her future-focused exchange-traded funds. Wednesday was a particular low point, with the flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ticker ARKK) slumping 10% in its third-worst drop on record. One of the biggest drags that day was Coinbase Global Inc., the largest US cryptocurrency exchange, which tumbled 26% after disappointing results and amid a rout of digital assets. But while the rest of Wall Street was ditching the stock, Wood and her team stuck to their playbook and used the drop to increase holdings, adding about 860,000 shares in the week through Thursday. In many eyes, it’s a system that risks loading up on losers. Hitched to a concentrated portfolio of often highly speculative bets, it leaves Wood and her firm with plenty of critics. But the clarity of the goal -- chasing companies that can win big from major technological shifts -- and ARK’s commitment to it has won some remarkably loyal fans. “Cathie Wood has not wavered at all in her conviction in her strategy, and in fact has doubled down on her strategy,” said Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, an advisory firm. “That’s attractive to a certain segment of investors.” As it plunged on Wednesday, ARKK actually posted inflows. It was a relatively small amount for the $7.8 billion ETF -- about $45 million -- but net inflows in 2022 are more than $1.5 billion. That’s for a vehicle that has plunged as much as 61% this year. “Investors that are in this strategy have stayed loyal to this strategy, have a long-term time horizon and view selloffs as opportunities to deploy some additional capital,” said Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at ETF Trends. Of course, there’s also no shortage of investors ready to bet against ARK. Short interest in the main fund is a relatively elevated 14.8% of shares outstanding, according to data from IHS Markit Ltd. Meanwhile, by the close on Wednesday the price of the Tuttle Capital Short Innovation ETF, which aims to deliver the reverse performance of the innovation fund on a daily basis, was more than double that of the ARK ETF. In other words, betting against Wood’s flagship strategy for a day cost twice as much as buying the fund itself to hold. But things were looking more positive for ARK by the end of the week as tech stocks managed a rebound. The innovation fund jumped 12% Friday after climbing 5.6% a day earlier. One of Wood’s high profile picks, Robinhood Markets Inc., was surging after cryptocurrency billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried revealed a major stake. It’s a long way from undoing recent damage to Wood’s main ETF -- the fund would have to jump about 260% from here to reclaim its all-time high. But at least it provides some respite for the faithful. Ultimately, investors continue to lean on Ark ETFs as vehicles to get in and out of disruptive technology. In a turbulent week for the flagship fund, trading volume surged to a record 316 million shares. As Ark sticks to its strategy, investors “know exactly what they’re going to get” and can rely on its funds to make pure-play trades on innovation, Geraci said. “The benefit of Cathie Wood not wavering from her strategy during this brutal downturn is that I think it will help the longer-term viability of Ark.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek What Happened When a Wall Street Investment Giant Moved to Nashville Venture Capitalists Are Aiming to Disrupt Fish Farming Crypto’s Fall, in Three Charts Starbucks Baristas Are Unionizing, and Even Howard Schultz Can’t Make Them Stop How Gillette Embraced the Beard to Win Over Scruffy Millennials ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•2 days ago,Cathie Wood Just Keeps Buying Coinbase and Getting More Inflows,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-just-keeps-buying-170000015.html
