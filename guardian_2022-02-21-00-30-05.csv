2/21/2022,"Joe Biden’s secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on Sunday the US national security council would meet to review the latest intelligence on Ukraine and “check plans”.  Blinken toured the TV political shows to press home the Biden administration’s message that the US remains convinced that Russia is poised to invade Ukraine. “As President Biden said, everything we are seeing tells us that the decision we believe President Putin has made to invade is moving forward,” he told CBS’s Face the Nation. Pressed to give details of why the US continues to believe an invasion is imminent despite repeated Russian denials, Blinken pointed to what he called “provocations” by separatist forces and “false flag operations” that could be used by Putin to justify overrunning its neighbour. “Now we have the news just this morning that the ‘exercises’ Russia was engaged with in Belarus, with 30,000 forces, which were supposed to end this weekend will now continue because of tensions in eastern Ukraine – tensions created by Russia.” Blinken had just returned from Munich, where he accompanied Kamala Harris to a security conference. He is scheduled to meet the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, in Europe next week, but has stipulated that the encounter will be cancelled if an invasion occurs. On Saturday, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was sharply critical of allied leaders for waiting to impose sanctions until after any bombardment had begun. He accused world leaders of “appeasement”. Asked by CBS to respond to the criticism, Blinken said: “We have put together in great detail the massive consequences that will befall Russia if it engages in this aggression. “The purpose of that is to deter the aggression, and once you trigger the sanctions you lose the deterrence.”",News/US news,Blinken: US national security council to meet as Russia Ukraine invasion looms,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/20/russia-invasion-ukraine-biden-blinken-us-national-security-council
2/21/2022,"Hospitals in England have been told to abandon targets aimed at limiting the number caesarean sections carried out, over fears for the safety of mothers and babies. Maternity units were told in a letter to stop pursuing “normal births”, with the chief midwife describing the targets as potentially “unsafe” and clinically inappropriate.  The letter from Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent, NHS England’s chief midwife, and Dr Matthew Jolly, the national clinical director for maternity, instructed “all maternity services to stop using total caesarean section rates as a means of performance management”. It added: “We are concerned by the potential for services to pursue targets that may be clinically inappropriate and unsafe in individual cases.” The changes have been welcomed by medical bodies, who have been calling for the targets to be scrapped for several years. Scrapping the targets was also recommended in July last year by a Commons health and social care committee report, which said it was “deeply concerning” that maternity services had been penalised for having high rates in the past. NHS trusts have for years benchmarked their caesarean section rates against the average. Around one in four babies in the UK is born by C-section, but there is considerable variability between different hospitals. There is concern that the pursuit of normal deliveries may have contributed to some instances of poor maternity care, including at Shrewsbury and Telford hospital NHS trust, where the deaths of dozens of babies are being investigated. The Shrewsbury trust had among the highest normal delivery rates in England, between 2010 and 2018. A report into the scandal will be published next month. The Royal College of Midwives (RCM) formally abandoned its normal birth campaign in 2017. Responding the change of policy, first reported in the Sunday Times, Gill Walton, RCM’s chief executive, said that decisions about clinical care should be made in the best interests of the woman and her baby “not because of an arbitrary target.” “While we welcome the decision by NHS England to remove targets that penalise maternity services for higher caesarean section rates, it’s a shame it’s taken so long,” she said. “Those running local services will be delighted that this target has finally been removed.” Dr Jo Mountfield, consultant obstetrician and vice president at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: “We welcome this clarification from NHS England. These targets are not appropriate in individual circumstances. Both vaginal and caesarean births carry certain benefits and risks, which should be discussed with women as they choose how they wish to give birth. Women giving birth should feel supported and their choices should be respected. The RCOG does not support one method of birth over another.”",News/Society,"Abandon ‘normal birth’ targets, hospitals in England told ",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/20/abandon-normal-birth-targets-caesarean-sections-hospitals-england
2/21/2022,"Tributes from across Northern Ireland’s political divide have been paid to Christopher Stalford, a Democratic Unionist party member of the Northern Ireland assembly who has died suddenly at the age of 39. The DUP leader, Jeffrey Donaldson, said he had talked at length on Friday night with Stalford, whom he described as a friend and as someone who had been “born to be a public representative”.  “He was passionate about Northern Ireland and wanted the best for his constituents.I was never to know how precious that conversation was to be,” said the MP. Stalford, who was seven when his father died aged 26 from a bleed on his brain, was born in Belfast, where he studied at Queen’s University after becoming involved in politics in his teenage years. After graduation, he worked for a number of the DUP’s elected representatives and later in the party’s press office and its policy unit. In 2005, he was elected to Belfast city council at the age of 22, the youngest person on the local authority, to represent the city’s Laganbank area. He was elected as the high sheriff of Belfast in 2010 and as deputy lord mayor in 2013. Three years later he was elected to represent Belfast South in the Northern Ireland Assembly, and from January 2020 he served as the principal deputy speaker of the Assembly. He is survived by his wife, Laura, and their four children. Referring to their Friday night conversation, Donaldson said that Stalford’s pride in his family had been apparent. He added: “He talked about his eldest child transferring to big school and the discussions that were ongoing in the home.” Sinn Féin’s vice-president, Michelle O’Neill, who was the deputy first finister of Northern Ireland until earlier this month, extended her sympathies, tweeting: “Desperately sad news of the sudden passing of DUP Assembly member Christopher Stalford.” Brandon Lewis, the secretary of state for Northern Ireland, also expressed his condolences on social media, adding: “As MLA and Principal Deputy Speaker, Christopher was passionate about crucial issues that affected people across NI and was dedicated to building a better Northern Ireland for everyone.” The Irish taoiseach, Micheál Martin, said he was “deeply saddened” by the death of the DUP politician, adding: “He served the people of South Belfast diligently and with integrity, working tirelessly to improve housing and education.” Stalford was described as “a genuine and funny person” by the leader of the Alliance Party, Naomi Long, who said that he had been dedicated to public service. “Christopher revelled in the role of Principal Deputy Speaker of the Assembly, carrying out his duties in an even-handed and fair manner, no matter the situation,” she added. The leader of the Ulster Unionist party, Doug Beattie, said: “This is absolutely tragic and shocking news which will be felt by every single person who worked at Stormont.” The SDLP postponed its spring conference, which had been due to take place on Sunday, as a mark of respect. Its leader, Colum Eastwood, said: “Christopher and I knew each other for more than 20 years and this news has come as such a shock. I don’t think there was a single political issue that Christopher and I agreed on, but one of my defining memories will be his great ability to disagree well.”",News/UK news,"Tributes paid to DUP politician Christopher Stalford, who has died at 39",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/20/tributes-paid-to-dup-politician-christopher-stalford-who-has-died-at-39
2/21/2022,"When thousands of protesters against Covid restrictions arrived in Ottawa last month, it would have seemed unimaginable that they would take over parts of the Canadian capital with little resistance.  To their own disbelief, the rightwing protesters soon controlled the streets outside parliament, brazenly flouting the law in the belief nothing could or would stop them. This weekend, however, the blockade ended in incredulity, accusations of betrayal and questions over the future of the protest movement. On Friday and Saturday, hundreds of officers conducted one of Canada’s largest police operations, working to clear Parliament Hill and the surrounding area of trucks, camper vans and structures that had blocked roads for nearly a month, in protest of coronavirus-related public health restrictions and, in general, the government of Justin Trudeau. Deploying riot squads, mounted units and armed vehicles, police cleared large parts of the area. By Saturday night, more than 170 had been arrested and 37 vehicles had been towed. Protesters remained in some areas but Wellington Street, in front of Parliament Hill, was empty. A sense of normalcy was on the horizon for residents of Ottawa but police warned the operation wasn’t finished. “We are in this until it is over,” interim chief Steve Bell said, as officers worked to end the “unlawful occupation”. The rapid dismantling of the blockades stood in stark contrast to weeks of bold protest as truckers flouted bylaws, blaring horns at all hours. Even as police threatened to break up the blockades and the prime minister, Trudeau, invoked the Emergencies Act, many protesters were unfazed, arguing police didn’t have the authority to break up the protests. Key influencers in the movement, including Pat King, repeatedly reinforced this message. “King told protesters the warnings from police weren’t official because they didn’t have signatures on them or that the city didn’t have a police chief so no one could give the order,” said Kurt Phillips of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network. “And he was telling this to people who don’t really understand how government works.” But in the waning days of the blockade, amid reports some leaders had their bank accounts frozen, defiance gave way to uncertainty. Csaba Vizi, a trucker from Windsor, went viral on social media after he pledged to come home “glorious like Caesar, or in a body bag”. The night before the police operation, however, Vizi and other drivers left the city. Many did so after trucking companies, fearing ruin, ordered them home. Still, even as police swarmed the area on Friday, many protesters expressed disbelief that arrests were possible. “You can’t do this. You can’t do this. You have no right,” pleaded one woman as a line of police pushed towards a blockade on Rideau Street. Another broke down in tears as protesters were hauled off. As footage of arrests and scuffles spread, on the secure-messaging site Telegram groups supporting the truckers reacted with shock and skepticism. One user claimed the officers were with the United Nations, part of a common conspiracy theory which holds that Canada’s government is linked to globalist networks. “If they had this many officers, there would be no crime in the city,” the user wrote. A number of police forces, including the Ottawa city police, the Ontario provincial police, the Royal Canadian Mounted police and the Sûreté du Québec, participated in the operation to clear the streets. Others were told, often by protest leaders and organizers, the police supported their movement. “They honestly believe that all of Canada supports them. And so it’s shocking to them to learn they aren’t seen as heroes,” said Carmen Celestini, a postdoctoral fellow with the Disinformation Project at Simon Fraser University, adding that many believed police officers were on their side. “And now they’ve realized that’s not true.” Police arrested nearly all protest leaders who called on demonstrators to “hold the line”. But the perceived ease with which some handed themselves over sparked a sense of betrayal. One user on a Telegram group accused Tamara Lich, the lead fundraiser, of having ties to the financier George Soros. “A lot of patriotic Canadian[s] were duped into believing this [convoy] was real,” the user wrote. Benjamin Dichter, a protest leader, called on supporters to stand their ground but left Ottawa before he could be arrested. His decision prompted one Telegram user to call him a “globalist operative subverting the freedom convoy”. “Influential figures were really pushing disinformation to keep the protesters there,” said Celestini. “But even though they told supporters to ‘hold the line’, they really didn’t have a plan for what to do when arrests occurred. The leaders knew that they would have an escape plan and that they’d be OK. But their decision to leaving their supporters out there to face the consequences helps you see their character.” The conspiracy theories and populist anger underpinning the truckers’ moment are unlikely to disappear. Experts said supporters will likely try to spin the result of the barricade as a victory or the catalyst for a bigger war. Furthermore, mainstream and fringe politicians have started vying for influence among the movement’s supporters. “There are a number of politicians looking to use this as a springboard,” said Phillips, warning of a “disruptive force” in Canadian politics. False rumours of a woman killed by a police horse have spread throughout Canada and into the US, amplified by far-right figures. Celestini worries such misinformation, rapidly spread by live streaming and encrypted chat networks, will be a problem. “We’ve been ignoring people like this for decades. But now we’re seeing the fruits of how we ignored and dismissed people who believed these things,” she said. “The distrust that people have in institutions will remain. And that leave a real possibility for something similar to fester or grow.”",News/World news,Ottawa protests: conspiracies and accusations of betrayal as police end blockade,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/20/ottawa-protests-capital-police-clear-blockade
2/21/2022,"Phil Foden and the Manchester City player’s family were the subject of an abusive attack on Saturday night at Manchester’s AO Arena which has caused shock at his club, after a video of the incident was circulated on social media. Foden and a woman believed to be his mother, Claire, are shown in the film being hounded in the backstage area of the venue before they and their entourage enter a private box for refuge.  The woman emerges a moment later and, after a scuffle, is seen being hit by a man following which a fight occurs. It is understood that directly before the episode shown in the footage, Foden – who was attending a boxing event headlined by Amir Khan v Kell Brook – had been harassed by a group despite the 21-year-old trying to ignore them. A City statement said: “The club is aware of a video which has circulated on social media showing Phil Foden and his family being harassed and abused. We are shocked and appalled about the nature of the abuse and ensuing assault on one of Phil’s family members. “We will continue to give Phil and his family all the support and assistance they need.” Foden was one of a contingent of City players at Manchester Arena for the Amir Khan-Kell Brook boxing fight, who had attended following their 3-2 loss to Tottenham earlier in the day. The attack occurred after the bout and is understood to have caused Foden and his family and friends particular distress due to their view they were completely blameless. After making his debut as a 17-year-old in November 2017, Foden has become a key member of Pep Guardiola’s team, winning three Premier League titles, four League Cups, the FA Cup and last season was voted the Professional Footballers’ Association Young Player of the Year.

2/21/2022,"The west has inflicted catastrophic damage on Afghanistan and its own reputation by imposing a policy of starvation on the country, according to David Miliband, the former UK foreign secretary and chief executive of the International Rescue Committee. “If we wanted to create a failed state we could not have a more effective policy mix than the one we have at the moment,” he told the Guardian.  Miliband has been at the forefront of those lobbying the Biden administration and the World Bank to release cash not only for humanitarian aid but also to start reconstructing the economy. “I simply do not understand the lack of urgency to get this thing moving. It genuinely befuddles me that we should have allowed this to get so much worse so quickly,” he said. He warned the crisis was so deep that the UN’s appeal for $4bn this year, due to be addressed at a pledging conference next month, was likely to rise to $10bn next year. There are reports that the World Bank board may meet in March to release as much as £1bn that it has so far refused to release. On his first visit to London in two years, he said: “What we are doing is not making it worse for the Taliban, it is making it worse for the people. We are not punishing the Taliban. It is ordinary Afghans that are paying the price of peace. It is not just a catastrophe of choice, but a catastrophe of reputation. This is a starvation policy.” Fresh from testifying to the Senate foreign relations committee inquiry on the scale of the crisis, Miliband challenged those who believe that withholding aid would produce a more pluralist Taliban. He said: “There is absolutely no evidence that people who have spent 20 years fighting the Americans and won a war are now going to become susceptible to leverage that they have not been susceptible to for 20 years. The choice is a very brutal one. It is not ‘do you help the Taliban or not?’ It is “do you help the people or not?’. This is a government where already 75 % of its spending came in the form of international aid and has gone overnight.” He said four problems needed to be addressed urgently if the country was to survive the remainder of the winter. “There is no money to pay salaries. Some teachers and hospital workers have not been paid since April. That has to change. “The US sanctions continue to have a chilling effect on commercial activity even though there are carve-outs in US and international sanctions for humanitarian purposes. The carve-out does not touch commercial entities so if you are a private agricultural or food importer who has to touch the government at the border in some way you are scared you are going to get caught up in the sanctions. “Then there is the liquidity crisis, so there is no capital underpinning the banking system so no one can lend or pay for imports. Finally there are no technocrats or expertise in the Central Bank – they have all left. All this can be done without having to get into the issue of recognition of the Taliban. “Together this is causing an economic freeze and in these tragic circumstances you can give more aid until you are blue in the face, and it will not solve the structural problems. I am in the ridiculous position of running an aid agency and I am saying ‘don’t just give out humanitarian aid, you have to underpin the economy’”. He said the Taliban were being given the perfect excuse not to be challenged on the right of women to go to school since the salaries of teachers were not being paid.",News/World news,"West has inflicted catastrophic damage on Afghanistan, says David Miliband",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/20/west-catastrophic-damage-afghanistan-taliban-david-miliband
2/21/2022,"Up until the past 18 months, Bad Boy Chiller Crew’s music seemed a secondary consideration. The most interesting thing about the Bradford rap trio was their chaotic, hilarious videos, capturing a head-on collision between Jackass and People Just Do Nothing, their entire existence a loving if hopelessly deracinated tribute to hip-hop culture. A typical BBCC song would tether a speeded-up vocal to a rudimentary bassline house beat and subject it to torture by mediocre rapping. At best it sounded like your little brother’s grubby mates squawking about drugs, clothes, cars and girls over a 20-year-old UK garage CD. At worst, pretty much the same. Perhaps the pandemic focused their minds on quality control, or there’s something comforting about BBCC’s relentlessly optimistic nihilism while the world burns around, but all last year’s singles plus a dozen new drops here add up to an excellent, if exhausting, mixtape. Sensibly, songs confine themselves to three minutes or less, and there’s a wild joy to their commitment to entertainment.

2/21/2022,"A wave of attacks on “woke” charities by rightwing politicians has “backfired”, generating an outpouring of public support for the targeted charities and helping drive a surge in social justice activism, say campaigners. An annual survey of social campaigning suggests many charities feel increasingly emboldened to speak out on contested issues, including race, immigration and the environment, despite attacks they feel are designed to intimidate them into silence.  The findings of the Sheila McKechnie Foundation survey come as charities report huge concern over the “chilling” impact on civil society of a raft of proposed legislation designed to restrict public protest and legal challenge. Campaigners said they have faced an increasingly hostile political environment – 78% said they felt politicians were hostile to civil society campaigning, up from 63% the previous year. A majority said attacks by politicians and the media were a threat to charities’ right to speak out and campaign. However, the survey also found the attacks persuaded many charities to re-examine their mission and refocus on campaigning, and had revealed heartening public support for social activism. A third of charities said they were now “more likely to speak out”. “The high-profile attacks on charities over the past few years seem to have backfired. Many have responded by asking themselves if they are still honouring their core mission by speaking out and concluded that, in fact, campaigning is not just their right but their duty,” said Sue Tibballs, the chief executive of the Sheila McKechnie Foundation. A number of charities, including the National Trust and Barnardo’s, have faced coordinated attacks by backbench Conservative MPs for supposedly “political” or “woke” stances on such as racism and inequality at odds with their core charitable mission, The MPs argued the charities’ role was to provide services, not engage in social issues. The National Trust was called “Marxist” and politically correct for publishing a report highlighting the slave trade links of some of its historical properties, the race equality thinktank Runneymede trust was accused of having a “political agenda,” and the children’s charity Barnardo’s of promoting “ideological dogma”. All three were investigated by the Charity Commission after the backbench “Common Sense” group of Conservative MPs complained they had breached charity laws. In each case they were cleared of wrongdoing. The National Trust subsequently reported record numbers of new members, despite critics’ claims it was losing public support. In another high profile case, the RNLI – the UK’s national lifeboat charity – was accused by Nigel Farage, the former leader of the UK Independence party and Brexit party, of running a “migrant taxi service” for rescuing migrants at risk of drowning in the Channel. It robustly defended its work, and received massive public support and a surge in donations as a result. The failure of those charges had convinced charities they were doing the right thing and the politicians were out of step with public opinion on issues like race equality, one refugee charity leader told the Guardian. “The feeling is, let’s stop caveating ourselves all the time, let’s be bolder,” they said. Halima Begum, the director of the Runnymede Trust, pointed to the wide public support for the England football team’s decision to make the anti-racist gesture of taking the knee. She said: “I feel when we talk about race at the moment we are reflecting public opinion, not attempting to change it.” One survey respondent wrote: “The attacks have made us invest a lot of time in getting our engagement right, we felt like we were on a tightrope and some powerful people were willing us to fall. However, the strategic review that resulted probably made us more focused and stronger,” one respondent wrote. Craig Bennett, the chief executive of The Wildlife Trusts, said: “There has been overreach by interests trying to ‘chill’ charities. It’s been so blatant and so shocking, this assault on civil liberties and campaigning, that people [in charities] are thinking: ‘We have to up the ante.’” The survey found 89% of respondents said they were “very concerned” the police bill going through parliament would, “chill” campaigning activity, with 60% saying the same about the judicial review bill. There were 118 respondents to the survey, carried out between October and December last year.",News/Society,"Attack on ‘woke’ charities has backfired, campaigners say",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/20/attack-on-woke-charities-has-backfired-campaigners-say
