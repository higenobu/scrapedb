3/26/2022,"“Iam writing among the gables and rook-haunted trees, with a sense of the place being almost too beautiful to live in,” wrote William Morris in 1872, the year after he co-signed the lease on Kelmscott Manor in Oxfordshire, which next week reopens to the public after a three-year, multimillion-pound refurbishment. Anyone who has seen designs by Morris will have seen motifs inspired by Kelmscott: Strawberry Thief, for instance, or Willow Bough. Morris, as his biographer Fiona MacCarthy put it, “had a sense of place so acute as to be almost a disability”; physical surroundings were so foundational to his thinking that MacCarthy listed locations as primary sources. Kelmscott, in particular, was central to his most deeply held beliefs – beliefs that were not only influential then, but are arguably even more important now. The beauty was not incidental: it was at the heart of his radical, actively fought-for socialism. His was a capacious definition of beauty, a beauty of wholeness: of household goods, of town planning. It stood against the alienating specialisations of capitalism, arguing for direct access to the making of things, however humble; making the case that work – and in fact all life, seriously undertaken – could and should be a pleasure and an art. And unlike the more brutalist, nature-dominating instincts often seen in communism, living in harmony with the natural world was paramount. “I have more than ever at my heart,” he wrote in 1880, “the importance for people of living in beautiful places; I mean the sort of beauty which would be attainable by all, if people could but begin to long for it.” That the embroideries, wallpapers and tapestries he made in accordance with these principles were – because of their resultant expense and the education required to appreciate them – inaccessible to the majority only intensified his anger at the inequalities deepening around him. And as Anna Mason points out in her introduction to a major retrospective published on the 125th anniversary of his death, Morris’s socialism was not parochial: “the Indian or Javanese craftsman may no longer ply his craft leisurely ... a steam-engine is set a-going at Manchester … and the Asiatic worker, if he is not starved to death outright … is driven himself into a factory to lower the wages of his Manchester brother-worker” – an indictment of globalisation before globalisation was even a word. In Morris’s propaganda novel News from Nowhere (full of descriptions of Kelmscott Manor), the narrator wakes on the banks of the Thames. The polluted waters have cleared. England has become a socialist paradise, with equality between classes and sexes (Morris was public in his support of women’s rights), no private property, no prisons. No parliament either, which did not stop Labour politicians from Clement Attlee to Aneurin Bevan (who recited Morris to help him get over his stammer) to Tony Blair from citing him as a major influence. We may not want to go quite as far as Morris suggests, but the underpinning ideas – the thoroughgoing rethinking of capitalism, the radical wholeness and moral heft of his vision – have an urgency that has only increased with time.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on William Morris: a man for all seasons | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/25/the-guardian-view-on-william-morris-a-man-for-all-seasons
3/26/2022,"A major deal that will see the US ramp up its supply of gas to Europe in an attempt to shift away from Russian fossil fuel imports risks “disaster” for the climate crisis, environmental groups have warned. Under the agreement, unveiled on Friday, the US will provide an extra 15bn cubic meters of liquified natural gas (LNG) to the European Union this year. This represents about a tenth of the gas the EU now gets from Russia, which provides 40% of the bloc’s total gas supply. The increased gas exports from the US will escalate further, with the EU aiming to get 50bn cubic meters of gas a year from America and other countries in order to reduce its reliance upon Russia after its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. Joe Biden, who announced the deal during a trip to Brussels, said the increased supply will ensure “families in Europe can get through this winter” while also hampering Vladimir Putin, who has used gas income to “drive his war machine”. But environmental groups have reacted to the agreement with alarm, arguing that it will help embed years of future gas use at a time when scientists say the world must rapidly phase out the use of fossil fuels to avoid catastrophic climate change. “We should be rapidly transitioning to affordable clean energy, not doubling down on fossil fuels,” said Kelly Sheehan, senior director of energy campaigns at the Sierra Club. “Reducing reliance on fossil fuels is the only way to stop being vulnerable to the whims of greedy industries and geopolitics.” The US has in recent years become a net exporter of energy, with fracking technology helping draw upon its huge reserves of gas. When frozen into LNG, this gas can be loaded on to ships and exported around the world. The US is already running at near capacity for the amount it is able to ship out. However, there are 16 proposed LNG terminals dotted along the US’s Gulf of Mexico coast that have already been awarded the necessary federal permits to proceed with construction. The deal with the EU could make these projects, which would take several years to build and operate, possibly for decades to come, appear more viable than previously. “Allowing for the expansion of new and expanded gas export facilities would lock in decades of reliance on risky, volatile fossil fuels and spell disaster for our climate and already overburdened Gulf coast communities,” said Sheehan. Biden has insisted the plan will not compromise his climate goals, claiming that the war in Ukraine will act as a “catalyst” for the deployment of renewable energy. The US and EU have pledged to work together to push forward approvals for solar and wind projects, plug leaks from gas pipelines that spew methane, a potent greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere and work on energy efficiency measures that will reduce demand for fossil fuels. But climate activists warn time is running out to avoid disastrous global heating. The International Energy Agency has said that no new fossil fuel infrastructure can be built worldwide if the planet is to avoid 1.5C of heating above the pre-industrial era, a point beyond which scientists say will dramatically increase dangerous heatwaves, flooding, droughts, wildfires and displacement of people. “Pushing new toxic export facilities and decades more methane gas is a death sentence for those on the frontlines of the climate emergency, and it won’t solve Europe’s current crisis,” said Kassie Siegel, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute. “Approving more export terminals, pipelines and fossil fuel production only throws fuel on the fire of our burning world.”",News/Environment,US plan to provide 15bn cubic meters of natural gas to EU alarms climate groups,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/25/environment-groups-alarmed-liquified-natural-gas-us-eu
3/26/2022,"Authorities in Mariupol have said as many as 300 people were killed in a Russian bombing of a theatre last week, putting a death toll for the first time on the deadliest single attack since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine more than a month ago. The figure, based on the accounts of witnesses, came as the United Nations human rights team in Ukraine said it had reports of mass graves in the southern port city, including one that appeared to hold 200 people. Mariupol, which has seen some of the most horrific fighting and bombardment of civilian targets such as hospitals and apartment blocks, stands in the way of Russia securing a land corridor between Crimea and the eastern Donbas region that include the parts of Luhansk and Donetsk held by pro-Russian forces with Moscow’s backing since 2014. The Kremlin hinted on Friday that it may be scaling back its war ambitions, saying it was close to completing the “first phase” of its military campaign and would now focus on the complete “liberation” of Donbas in eastern Ukraine. “The combat potential of the armed forces of Ukraine has been considerably reduced, which … makes it possible to focus our core efforts on achieving the main goal, the liberation of Donbas,” said Sergei Rudskoi, the head of the Russian general staff’s main operational directorate. He said that while Russia did not rule out that its forces would storm cities such as Kyiv, taking them over was not a primary objective. The comments correspond with Ukrainian and western analysis that Russian forces have put their efforts around Kyiv on hold as they are unable to fight both there and in Mariupol, a key port in Vladimir Putin’s war plan. But western officials cautioned that rather that pulling back, Russia was sending extra forces into Ukraine and preparing to deploy another 10 battalion tactical groups – a fighting unit of about 1,000 troops, plus tanks and heavy artillery – from Siberia in the east and Kaliningrad in the west to add to the original invasion force of 115,000 to 120,000. Committing the extra forces was a sign “how far Putin has gone all in”, one official said. In other developments on Friday: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, implored Viktor Orbán, the Hungarian prime minister, to cut trade ties with Russia and join other EU countries in supplying arms to Ukraine. “Listen, Viktor, do you know what’s going on in Mariupol?” Zelenskiy said, adding that Hungary needed “to decide who you are with”. Joe Biden visited the Polish town of Rzeszów, near the Ukrainian border, in a symbolic show of support for Nato’s eastern European members and for a first-hand look at international efforts to help more than 2 million Ukrainian refugees who have fled the country. Vladimir Putin compared the cancellation of events involving Russian artists in protest over the invasion to the burning of books in Nazi Germany. “Today they are trying to cancel a 1,000-year-old country,” Putin said. Britain believes about a sixth or maybe a fifth of Russia’s invasion force – an estimated 20 battalion tactical groups – is no longer “combat effective” – a high degree of losses reflecting the botched invasion and fierce Ukrainian fightback. Putin’s goal was understood by western officials to have been to secure Kyiv within days of the invasion being launched on 24 February. In a sign of diminishing troop morale, western officials claimed that a Russian commander of the 37th motor rifle brigade was deliberately run over by his own troops in response to the massive military losses being endured. In Mariupol, Putin’s forces are now pushing deep into the administrative part of the city. Ukrainian sources told the Guardian that they were now clearing multi-storey buildings “one by one and methodically checking every square inch”. The source said: “If nobody opens the door or the apartment is empty, they break down the door. They are looking for the military and potential saboteurs. They use a scorched-earth policy, to make sure there’s no one to shoot at them or to throw Mmolotov cocktails. I can tell they rely on their previous experience of urban warfare.” The Ukraine government believes the Azov battalion in the city will continue to fight on, holding up Putin’s plans to create a land corridor enabling his forces to resupply through Mariupol’s port. Officials in the besieged city said on Friday that at least 300 people were now known to have been killed in the bombing on 16 March of Mariupol’s Drama Theatre, which had been marked with white paint as containing sheltering children. Civilians trapped in Mariupol, normally home to 400,000 people, have been sheltering in basements with little food, power or running water. About 1,300 people were believed to have been in the building when it was struck, and 150 survivors staggered out of the rubble after the attack. Sources said the bulk of those in the theatre had been hiding from the shelling under the stage and that rubble was blocking their exit. There are no emergency services operating in Mariupol and the intense fighting and shelling near the theatre has prevented rescue attempts. The Ukrainian government previously said it was impossible to tell how many were killed because Mariupol was in chaos and under almost constant bombardment from Russian forces. In a statement on Friday morning, a spokesperson for the city council said they were able to share a death toll. The statement said: “From eyewitnesses, information appears that about 300 people died in the Drama Theatre of Mariupol as a result of a bombardment by a Russian aircraft.” The Ukrainian defence was boosted on Thursday by the destruction of the Orsk landing ship docked in Berdyansk on the Azov Sea using Ukrainian ballistic missiles. Two other vessels were made inoperable. The Orsk, which contained weapons and supplies for forces fighting in Mariupol, was capable of carrying 20 tanks, 45 armoured vehicles and 400 troops.",News/World news,"Mariupol theatre bombing killed 300, Ukrainian officials say",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/25/mariupol-theatre-bombing-killed-300-ukrainian-officials-say
3/26/2022,"With a swipe of his right boot, Aleksandar Trajkovski sent Italy back in time: to November 2017, their lowest moment, a nightmare that a nation has spent four and a half years trying to escape. Back then, the head of the Italian Football Federation, Carlo Tavecchio, described missing out on a World Cup as an “apocalypse”. What word could describe a repeat of the end of all things? Roberto Mancini was without answers in the wake of Italy’s 1-0 defeat by North Macedonia on Thursday night. He took the blame on himself, but more than once reached for the same phrase as he fielded questions about the match and his future: “I wouldn’t know what to say.” To fail like this was, on the surface, inexplicable. Italy, winners of the European Championship last summer, had held 65% of possession and taken 32 shots to North Macedonia’s four. There were no end of statistics to illustrate their superiority – from the corner count (16 to 0) through to expected goals (1.98 to 0.18). And yet, there were few clearcut chances. Only when the North Macedonian goalkeeper, Stole Dimitrievski, passed straight to Domenico Berardi in the 29th minute, offering an open net, did a goal truly seem likely. The Italian rolled the ball tamely into Dimitrievski’s arms. You could call it an unlucky night. There was nothing inevitable in the fact that Trajkovski should bury his shot so brilliantly in the 92nd minute, even if he was back at the Stadio Renzo Barbera, where he played for Palermo in Serie B three years before. Equally, though, this match was no outlier. Italy have sometimes seemed close to invincible under Mancini – setting an international football record as they went 37 matches undefeated, finally succumbing to Spain in the Nations League after playing for more than a half with 10 men. Yet they have not had a winning habit for some time. Only two of their preceding nine matches ended with victory inside 90 minutes. Penalties were required to overcome Spain and England in the final rounds of Euro 2020. Profligacy got them into this playoff mess. The Azzurri took 27 shots to Bulgaria’s four last September in a match that finished 1-1. They drew twice with Switzerland after Jorginho missed penalties that could have won both matches. Either would have sufficed to top the group. Whose fault is it when a team forgets how to score? It would be easy to make a scapegoat of the centre-forward Ciro Immobile, who has three times finished as Serie A’s capocannoniere – equalling the league’s record with 36 goals two seasons ago – yet found the net 15 times in 55 Italy appearances. He drew a blank just as in both legs of the playoff loss to Sweden in 2017. Yet this was collective failure. Lorenzo Insigne’s form for Napoli has dropped off noticeably since Euro 2020, critics suggesting that his mind is already with Toronto FC, the MLS club he will join in the summer. Federico Chiesa is injured. Berardi was the only member of the attack to arrive in full health and good form. Why did Mancini stick with a group of forwards, and indeed a formation, that was no longer working? A system that had perhaps not functioned quite the same since Davide Spinazzola was injured against Belgium last summer. The more vexing question for Italian football is whether the alternatives were simply not good enough. As Italy searched for a goal in Sicily, Mancini sent on Giacomo Raspadori, a promising but raw talent who had scored once in seven appearances for the national team, and João Pedro, an uncapped 30-year-old with one goal in his past 13 games for Cagliari, 17th in Serie A. Tavecchio’s successor at the Italian Football Federation, Gabriele Gravina, acknowledged that reality on Thursday night. “There are very few selectable players,” he said. “We must understand why so many young players don’t get used [by their club teams].” It is one thing, though, to identify the ailment, and another to find a cure. Plenty of words were expended after the apocalypse of 2017 on the failings of Italian football’s youth development and a need to do things differently. Five years later, here we are. That is not to say nothing has changed for the better. Mancini is not Giampiero Ventura, who never knew success to begin with and whose tenure ended with open mutiny from his own substitute’s bench. The core of the team that won the Euros remains, and there are emerging talents to build on, from Alessandro Bastoni at centre-back to Sandro Tonali in midfield. Gravina insisted he would like Mancini to stay, and plenty of Italians would support that. Everything good that happened in the past three and a half years has not been eliminated in one stroke. Yet the inescapable reality is that Italy will miss a second consecutive World Cup: a catastrophe for a generation of players. Jorginho, third in the Balon d’Or last year, has represented Italy since 2016 without having the possibility to be called up for a tournament that the Azzurri have won four times. Marco Verratti, Italy’s enfant terrible at Brazil 2014, will be 33 by 2026. Little wonder that Mancini, whose contract runs to that summer, was struggling to come to terms with Thursday night. “The disappointment right now is too great to talk about the future,” he said. “Just as the victory last July was the most beautiful thing I’ve experienced at a professional level, this is the greatest disappointment of all.”",Sport/Football,What now for Italy after catastrophe of missing second World Cup in a row? | Nicky Bandini ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/25/what-now-for-italy-after-catastrophe-of-missing-second-world-cup-in-a-row
3/26/2022,"Ukraine has so many nightmares to contend with, but here’s one more: that Ukraine becomes Bosnia. By Bosnia I don’t mean the country itself so much as the war of a quarter-century ago and the way that conflict came to be seen from afar. For much of the 1990s, war in the Balkans was background noise, even to those who were just an hour or two’s flight away. Every now and then an especially horrible episode might propel it to the top of the news; otherwise, Bosnia was a permanent fixture on the inside pages and halfway through the TV bulletin. Bridget Jones confessed to her diary that she felt guilty for not talking or thinking about it, but it just slipped out of view. Besides, you knew the war would still be there tomorrow. That is the danger Volodymyr Zelenskiy faces now: that his struggle against Russian invasion becomes a long, slow war of attrition and so, with time, the world’s attention starts to wander. The war would go on; it would still be there on page 14. But newer stories would edge it aside. Soon, yellow and blue would be last season’s colours. Zelenskiy seems aware of this danger, and if anyone can combat it, it’s him. He’s not merely a politician with a knack for communication. Often missed in descriptions of him as a former entertainer is the fact that he made his fortune as a phenomenally successful producer of television. His core team in the presidential palace is the same group that ran his production company: his speechwriter is a scriptwriter. The Kyiv-born author of This Is Not Propaganda, Peter Pomerantsev, says of the Zelenskiy inner circle: “They’re all showrunners.” Note the present tense. There is nothing former about Zelenskiy and his colleagues’ vocation: they’re still producers now. Indeed, there is scarcely a gap between Zelenskiy’s two incarnations as politician and performer. His most famous hit show was called Servant of the People; his political party is called Servant of the People. Zelenskiy is hardly the first to grasp the tight connection between politics and storytelling. In some ways, he is merely succeeding in doing what Donald Trump longed to do: conducting a presidency like a top-rated TV series, with great visuals, shocking plot twists and plenty of action. Except Trump not only lacked Zelenskiy’s talent, he had to rely on manufactured drama and imagined enemies. The Ukrainian president is in a bloody war against an enemy who is all too real. Of course, the primacy of “comms” long predates Trump and Zelenskiy. In David Hare’s new play Straight Line Crazy, the urban planner Robert Moses is hailed in the 1920s as “a new kind of man … the man who believes that the way you’re written about is as important as what you do”. But Zelenskiy has taken it to a new level, not least because he has adapted everything he learned from conventional TV to the idiom of social media. He understands that in the new era, the war leader does not stand besuited at a podium, declaiming a speech packed with rhetorical flourish. Instead, Zelenskiy’s message is that he is a servant of the people because he is one of the people, no different from any of them. In his trademark short videos, he wears military olive-green, but it’s not a formal uniform, still less the ceremonial getup of a head of state. He wears exactly what a civilian volunteer would wear. The locations are chosen just as deliberately. If he’s not at a simple desk in a plain office, he’s just outside the presidential palace, with landmarks Ukrainians would recognise visibly in shot. As David Patrikarakos, whose book, War in 140 Characters, was among the first to identify the changing face of battle in the age of Twitter, tells me: “In those videos, Zelenskiy is literally the man in the street.” Together with a knack for demotic, unflowery soundbites – “I need ammunition, not a ride” – he has become a master of what Patrikarakos calls “digital statesmanship”. He’s Churchill with an iPhone. By comparison Moscow, until recently feared as the master of manipulation by social media, has looked lumbering, slow and old: “There’s Zelenskiy,” says Patrikarakos, “and then there’s this Botoxed Bond villain who won’t sit at a table with other people. All that’s missing is a trapdoor and a pool of sharks.” (As if to show he has not entirely lost his touch for fuelling culture wars in the west, today Vladimir Putin tried to cast himself as defender of JK Rowling against the western malaise of “cancel culture” – which would be convincing but for the fact that Rowling is no ally of his, but is instead spending big money protecting vulnerable children in Ukraine.) And yet, there are limits to Kyiv’s success in the messaging wars. For one thing, while it has made the Ukrainian president a hero in the west, it is not penetrating elsewhere. It was notable that the 35 countries that abstained on this month’s UN resolution condemning Moscow’s invasion account for half the world’s population. Zelenskiy is a hit in Paris and Berlin; in Beijing and Delhi, not so much. But the other obstacle is the Bosnia problem, the risk that the longer this goes on, the likelier it is that fatigue and boredom set in. Social media in particular crave novelty. Once the initial shock of footage of bombed-out buildings or distraught victims wears off, Ukraine could recede from the public mind. Perhaps mindful of that danger, Zelenskiy has been careful to offer variety. In his rolling series of video link addresses to the world’s parliaments – itself an innovation – he’s careful to tailor his message to his audience. Speaking to Westminster, he channelled Churchill. To Capitol Hill, it was America “the leader of the free world”. To Budapest on Thursday, he invoked the memory of the fascist massacre on the banks of the Danube. He is intensifying his language too, shaming western allies for not doing enough. “Why can’t we get weapons from you?” he asked Israeli lawmakers on Sunday, reminding them they would “have to live with” their decision. Visually, he’s mixing things up: this week saw a montage, complete with voiceover in English. It looked and sounded like a trailer for a Hollywood blockbuster. But canny messaging and sharp production values take you only so far. Pomerantsev says: “Sympathy is not enough. He has to take people on a journey towards something.” There has to be a concrete goal, besides day-to-day survival: maybe Ukraine’s bid to join the EU. Yana Lyushnevskaya of BBC Monitoring tells me that Zelenskiy’s great gift as a comedian was his ability to know what his audience “were scared of”: maybe his next move will be to play on global fears of a Russian nuclear, chemical or biological attack. “That would be the most logical thing for him to do.” In truth, this should not all be on Zelenskiy and his extraordinary team of TV maestros. Putin’s threat is not just to Ukraine, but to a wider world that has not fully absorbed the menace it now confronts: a dictator ready to obliterate cities in the heart of Europe, his head filled with fantasies of conquest and domination, happy to ward off any challenge by threatening to unleash nuclear havoc. Turning back that danger cannot be left to a small group of creatives in a bunker in Kyiv, no matter how gifted. This is a task for the world. Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist.

3/26/2022,"“At the height of summer, we would get maybe 4,000 people a day,” says James Warbrick as he crosses the bridge into Whakarewarewa, a tiny Māori village pocketed between hundreds of steaming, bubbling geothermal pools – a place like no other and one at the heart of New Zealand’s tourism industry. But today there are no tourists in sight. When New Zealand shut its border two years ago as the Covid pandemic hit, Whakarewarewa lost 96% of its visitors overnight. Now, as the country prepares to start reopening to foreign visitors next month, its inhabitants are torn between their economic needs and trepidation at the destructive impact of tourism. Whakarewarewa, in the North Island town of Rotorua, is both a time capsule and a living, evolving place – the 27 families who live on site still cook, bathe and live alongside the hot springs and geysers, just as their tīpuna (ancestors) did. And, like their tīpuna, the families have survived by opening the village to tourists and adapting in times of crisis. Warbrick reaches down and opens a large wooden box on the ground. Inside, meat is cooking slowly, heated through by the mineral steam rising from below ground. Behind him, warm sulphurous mist billows up from the Parekohuru pool and shrouds the small houses in a white veil before being whipped up into the air, exposing the deep blue silica pools beneath. To one side of the pool are the baths, filled each morning, and left to cool enough for families to take an evening dip. To the other side is the open-air kitchen – vegetables are boiled in the 100C mineral spring and meat steamed in ovens that reach 200C. Warbrick – a fourth generation guide – tells stories about the pools, their names and their purposes, and chats about the histories of the houses and the families – all with an ease that comes from growing up watching generations of guides before him tell the stories of his village to more than 120,000 people a year. The village become a tourist attraction after the 1886 Mount Tarawera eruption, which buried the nearby Pink and White Terraces – a series of terraces, each with a geothermal pool, like a stepped fountain down the mountainside, that had been considered the “eighth wonder of the world”. After the explosion, the people of Whakarewarewa (Ngāti Wāhiao) took in the displaced Tūhourangi tribe, who had been master tour-guides at the terraces. Soon after, the two tribes adapted Tūhourangi’s skills to Whakarewarewa itself. Then, in 1901, the government established the world’s first tourism office, the Department of Tourist and Health Resorts, in Rotorua – and New Zealand’s tourism industry was born. For more than 130 years visitors have flocked to Whakarewarewa – right up until the pandemic hit, when suddenly, “like a rugby scrum collapsing”, everything went quiet, says 81-year-old Christina Gardiner, a guide and village kuia [elder]. The country’s great walks, its ski-slopes, its harbours and towns were still. Up until March 2020, tourism was New Zealand’s biggest export industry, contributing 20% of total exports and bringing in $40.9bn a year. Since then, many tourism businesses have struggled to survive. According to Tourism Industry Aotearoa, 90% of international tourism disappeared. In Whakarewarewa staff had to be laid off, stores shut down, and the village had to rely on government support grants to keep afloat. “Those were really, really hard times, and I don’t want to experience that ever again,” Warbrick said. But the inventive drive of his ancestors after the 1886 eruption was the motivation the village needed, he said. “It was horrendous what they went through, so we had to dig deep. They gave us confidence that we can get through this hard time.” When Gardiner and Warbrick are asked what the first lockdown was like for the village, the words come quick: “eerie”, “shocking”, “there were mixed emotions”. “But on the upside, we became very, very close,” Gardiner says. “It made our kids appreciate what they’d inherited. Before, the bath was a bath, but all of a sudden it was a place where they could be one with nature. “They are prepared to share it back with the world, but they have a different affinity to it now.” This month, prime minister Jacinda Ardern announced that the long wait for tourism’s return was nearly over. From 13 April, more than two years after the borders shut, New Zealand will reopen – first to Australians, then to other visa-waiver countries and finally the rest of the world. Pre-Covid, most New Zealanders agreed tourism was good for the country, but said the pressure on the environment, degradation of infrastructure and overcrowding were a concern, according to the 2020 Tourism Industry “mood of the nation” report. Three regions – Auckland, Queenstown and Rotorua – were perceived as being under too much pressure. The border reopening will be a lifeline for those regions that are tourist-dependent. For Whakarewarewa, while there is relief, there is also trepidation. If the pandemic hadn’t happened, New Zealand’s tourism industry and its effects “would still be on a fast track to destruction”, says Mike Gibbons, the village’s general manager. “We know that a lot of local communities were struggling with numbers, the impacts of waste and insufficient facilities.” Whakarewarewa serves as a fascinating microcosm of tourism in New Zealand, and the tension that exists between relying on tourism to survive, while trying to hold on to the wairua (spirit) of a place. It is also a case study in how the pandemic years could reorient New Zealand’s relationship with tourism. For the village, there is a reluctance to return to the previous tourism framework, which saw visitor numbers creeping up and the environment de-prioritised. It has already reoriented its tourism model once during the pandemic, to capture a domestic audience. Now, it wants to refocus its energy into a more environmentally friendly experience that is both intimate and sustainable. Having more than 100,000 tourists walking through the village every year is hard on the whenua (land), while one guide to 70 people lacks the connection the village wants to foster, Warbrick says. Gibbons adds that there are two words that come to mind when looking towards tourism of the future – manaakitanga, meaning extending love and support to someone, and kaitiakitanga, meaning guardianship and protection of the environment. “We’ve taken on a much stronger focus on what that really means to us,” Gibbons says. The pandemic has given the village a “chance to rethink,” Gibbons says, adding that now, they are considering limiting tour group sizes and would be happy to have just 40,000 visitors a year, a significant drop from pre-Covid times. “In other words, come back to basics,” Gardiner adds. “We’re like the Phoenix bird – you go down; you come back up fighting.”",News/World news,Māori village nestled among hot springs reckoning with the return of foreign tourists,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/26/maori-village-nestled-among-hot-springs-reckoning-with-the-return-of-foreign-tourists

I know that from my own family’s trauma, 18 March). I lived with my parents in a council flat some 100 yards from Vallance Road – it was 8 o’clock in the morning and I was getting ready for school. The explosion was a horrendous shock; I was just 13 and had been through most of the blitz. My route to school was about 25 yards from the site. We found the best night shelter in a deep unused underground station in Whitechapel. Like Jonathan’s family, we had our own tragedy: my father’s cousin was killed, but there was no funeral – not a single identifiable body part could be found. The trauma is seared into the memory.

The events taking place in Ukraine now took me back to the homes of my childhood, surrounded by refugees from the last century’s atrocities from this part of the world.Caroline TomiczekLondon  Thank you, Jonathan Freedland, for your courage in telling your personal story about how trauma lingers through the generations. Those of us who are the children and grandchildren of Holocaust survivors and refugees know well how succeeding generations must do the emotional processing that the traumatised were too overwhelmed to complete. Elie Wiesel said: “They who did not go through the experience must transmit it.” In addition to the huge amount of physical rebuilding required after this horrifically destructive episode comes to an end, there will be the need for generations and generations of emotional healing.Judy SherwoodSheffield  Jonathan Freedland refers to grainy archive photographs of the destruction caused by the V2 rocket that fell on Hughes Mansions. I also possess a grainy photograph that is a chilling reminder of the horrors of war. Mine is a picture of my father’s platoon, a group of 32 men in uniform smiling at the camera. Only three of the 32 returned home in 1945. As a boy, I could never understand why he spoke so little about his experiences, when the cinema was constantly showing films about our gallant servicemen in wartime. Only when I was an adult would he tell something of the horrors of his war. They are perhaps best explained in the words of my mother, who said he left a young man and came back home an old man whom she barely recognised. Truth is said to be the first casualty of war, but the pictures from Ukraine demonstrate all too well its terrible truths. One benefit will be the ending of the attitude that war is something that only happens far from home and to foreign peoples. It happens here, and it’s terrible. As we have now been exposed to the horrors of war, the peoples of western Europe will be supportive of actions to stop this one. Putin must be stopped now, for the sake of future peace in Europe.Derrick JoadLeeds  Thank you, Jonathan Freedland, for your very personal and very moving story, a reminder of how affronts and irredeemable loss are remembered through the generations, even when a measure of forgiveness has become possible. The Ukrainian people will breathe again, and some wounds will eventually heal, but lessons must be learned and not forgotten. We should take a lead from your brave and dignified mother and her “deep reservoirs of empathy for the suffering of others”.Anne ConstantineGreat Gransden, Cambridgeshire  Thank you for Jonathan Freedland’s deeply moving description of his “inherited memory” of destruction caused by a V2 rocket in London. Events in Ukraine will trigger memories we would prefer not to be awakened and, for others, memories they did not know they possessed. I was aged five when the second world war was declared but do not have memories to match Freedland’s. Nonetheless, a feeling of fear has been aroused in the past by my reading a history of the 1940 invasion of Norway – fears I did not know I had at the time. Memories stir. As a nation, Britain escaped invasion; Poland did not. It is no accident that it is Poland providing massive refugee assistance and that Britain is not.James LewisMarshfield, South Gloucestershire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

3/26/2022,"Your review of John Grindrod’s book Iconicon refers to Derek Walker as “the architect who laid out Milton Keynes”. In fact, the plan for the new town – including the main features of the grid road pattern, the linear park, the location of the centre and the districts, and the separation of housing and employment in the grid squares – was laid out in the Milton Keynes interim report by Llewelyn-Davies, Weeks, Forestier-Walker and Bor, published in 1968. The master plan published in March 1970, when Walker appeared on the scene, refined the layout but did not alter any of the main components. Walker did lay out the first grid squares of housing in geometrical forms, in which his preference for modernist characteristics produced houses of faulty design and construction. These areas were identified as socially deprived in a 1986 report. After his departure in 1976, the housing grid squares took on the character intended in the master plan and the houses reflected residents’ views. These were established in a 1979 study by the School for Advanced Urban Studies at Bristol University, as consultant to the Milton Keynes Development Corporation. Jeff Bishop, who led the study, wrote that “many of the results [were] a rediscovery of common sense”. It is time to lay to rest the erroneous opinion of the architectural press that Walker was the master planner of Milton Keynes. He was not, and what he did do caused much dissatisfaction.Peter WatermanSocial development director, MKDC 1972-88  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Why movie intermissions must return – now!, 21 March) during which an organist rises from below to entertain those queueing to buy comestibles from the ice-cream girl with a tray in the auditorium. Sherry can be purchased from the foyer. The programme has an A and a B film, both introduced from the stage. At the end of the evening, a silver dish is passed along the rows of seats and people are requested to deposit their sweet wrappings etc in it before the national anthem plays and everyone stands to sing along enthusiastically. If the projector breaks down, song sheets are passed around. This is all a little different to the 1960s, when, in my local fleapit in Newmarket, there was always a mad rush to get out quickly before “the Queen” began – and if caught trying to escape, you were given a sound telling off and banned from the next show by the commissionaire.Stephanie GarrettWelwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire  The Woolton Picture House in Liverpool gave nearly every film an interval.

3/26/2022,"How appalling and terrifying to read, in your article on book bans in US schools and elsewhere, of Qin Shi Huang, the Chinese emperor who had scholars buried alive and books burned to control how history would remember him (‘It’s a culture war that’s totally out of control’: the authors whose books are being banned in US schools, 22 March). Qin, of course, played an important part in the development of the Great Wall of China. He clearly wanted this seen as a rip-roaring success, especially after the long years to “get the wall done”. He obviously didn’t want a lot of pesky scholars pointing out that the wall was colossally expensive, had virtually no benefits and was an enormous impediment to trade. The preoccupations and anxieties of the powerful have endured, but thankfully present-day leaders don’t quite have the same scope to control how their own histories are written.Jamie MorrisBromsgrove, Worcestershire  Your article brought back memories of the mid-1970s when I was a school psychologist in West Virginia. New books were purchased every three years for use in the high schools. For the very first time books by several black authors had been included. In the Bible belt of America, this led to protests, and we were faced with aggressive protesters as we arrived for work. I even found a bullet hole in my office window.

Let’s follow the example of other employers and have webcams in the Houses of Parliament, government and constituency offices, and weekly reports on MPs’ online activity on government computers.

3/26/2022,"Alberta’s premier has called fellow Conservatives “lunatics” who are “trying to take over the asylum” as a populist mutiny in his party foreshadows a bitter fight for the future of Canada’s Conservative movement. In a leaked recording of a meeting with caucus staff on Tuesday, Premier Jason Kenney warned a far-right element – skeptical of coronavirus measures and wedded to conspiracy theories – could seize control of the party in the coming weeks as the United Conservatives hold a leadership review. “I will not let this mainstream conservative party become an agent for extreme, hateful, intolerant, bigoted and crazy views. Sorry to be so blunt with you but you need to understand what the stakes are here,” he said, before alluding to the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory with a warning that “people who think I am involved in a global conspiracy to traffic children” would show up to vote for his removal. The comments underscore both Kenney’s sagging poll numbers and the degree to which an energized faction of the United Conservatives threaten his leadership. But the controversy could also foreshadow a bitter fight for control over the federal Conservative party, as candidates vying for national leadership gauge a possible ideological shift in Alberta, the party’s electoral heartland. “The Conservatives seem to have this existential crisis, where they break apart and come together and break again,” said Lori Turnbull, director of Dalhousie University’s School of Public Administration, citing the “deep-seated” differences within the party that flare up every few years. “The federal candidates are definitely looking to see what happens in Alberta, because that’s going to be a big part of the game for whoever ends up winning the leadership race.” In a statement, the premier’s office said Kenney’s comments were “consistent” with previous public remarks on the issue. For the last two years, Kenney has led a party with strong internal divisions over public health measures, with the more anti-government element protesting lockdowns. Those fissures, which critics say slowed Alberta’s response, are cited as part of the reason that Alberta at one point during the pandemic had one of the highest coronavirus infection rates in North America. Recent polling suggests Kenney’s response to the crisis placated neither the libertarian element nor those wanting strong public health measures: the premier has one of the lowest approval ratings in the country. “He was seen as the saviour of a fractured party, a shot in the arm for Alberta. He looked like a slam dunk,” said Turnbull. “And now he’s crash and burned.” For his part, Kenney has suggested those looking to out him are “kooky people generally”. “[Prominent Alberta conservative] Preston Manning used to say that a bright light attracts a few bugs, well, there’s more than a few bugs attracted to us, this party, right now,” said Kenney. In the audio recording, the premier suggests mounting frustrations over the job led him to consider quitting. “What’s the easiest path for me? Just to take a walk. I don’t need this job. I could go to the private sector, have my evenings, weekends off,” he said. The premier opted to stay and fight, he said, over fears that internal turmoil would hand the rival New Democrats power in the next election. The party was hit with fresh turmoil this week after leadership made a last-minute switch to mail-in ballots, citing a record surge in party registration. The sudden shift has led to accusations of cheating by party members, some of whom called for Kenney to resign. The results will be announced 18 May and Kenney will need a simple majority to stay on as leader.",News/World news, Key Canadian Conservative calls fellow party members ‘lunatics’ in warning of populist mutiny,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/25/canada-alberta-premier-jason-kenney-conservatives-warning
3/26/2022,"Over lunch in Hensol on Friday Robert Page could not resist indulging in a replay or two of Gareth Bale’s irresistible free-kick, even if every viewing descended into the pair giggling at the sheer magnificence of it. “I just burst out laughing,” the interim Wales manager says. “He was laughing about it as well. It is the best free-kick I’ve ever seen in my life … if he stood in the corner with the ball in his hand, you couldn’t place it any closer into the corner. To do that when the pressure’s on, in a big game, it speaks volumes about him, not only as a player but as a person and as a character.” His character has been lampooned in Spain, the newspaper Marca branding the Wales captain a “parasite” alongside a graphic depicting Bale as an insect sucking blood from the Real Madrid badge on the eve of Thursday’s win over Austria. It perhaps explains why Bale celebrated his two extraordinary goals in Cardiff by repeatedly beating the dragon crest on his shirt. On Friday he took aim in a lengthy social media post at “parasite” journalists, pointing out the damage negative articles can cause and calling for change in the way “we publicly talk about and criticise people” for not meeting “often unrealistic expectations”. Bale’s timely masterclass on the pitch makes his exile in Spain all the more mystifying and his agent, Jonathan Barnett, has suggested the 32-year-old’s future will be dictated by whether Wales reach Qatar in November. Page may have been pushing it when saying Bale would walk on broken glass down the M4 to play for Wales but it is impossible to question the forward’s contribution. “He’s the first one on camp, every camp,” Page says. “He leads by example. He is a massive part of the culture that Gary [Speed] created and Chris Coleman inherited and built on. “He is the model professional, and I mean to the nth degree. He looks after what he eats, his sleep, his rest, recovery, that detail. It is no coincidence that he can still deliver performances like that at international level against a top, top team. Players like him can just turn it on when they want and adrenaline would have helped him.” He was not the only one. Aaron Ramsey went the distance on his sixth successive Wales start. Neco Williams, who did not make a league start this season until joining Fulham in February, furrowed with vigour down the left and Joe Rodon put in a gutsy display. He has not been given a Tottenham start since playing Morecambe in January. “How, after performances like that, I don’t know,” Page says. A statistic lost amid the celebrations – strobe lights returned at full time to prolong the party – is that Wales have not been beaten in Cardiff in 17 games since November 2018. It underlines how tantalisingly close they are to a first World Cup since 1958. “It’s lovely to be on Welsh turf,” Connor Roberts said, looking down the camera, before Thursday’s game and Scotland or Ukraine, who will head there in the rearranged playoff final, will do well to cope with another supercharged atmosphere. Austria’s fidgeting players did not know where to look as supporters linked arms for a rousing rendition of Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau. “It is phenomenal and the supporters have to take a massive amount of credit for that,” Page says of the unbeaten home run. “It was a hairs-on-the-back-of-your-neck moment again when they were singing the anthem. All right, the luck of the draw has said we’ve got another home draw for the final, which is great, but we won’t just take our foot off the gas now and expect the stat to help us out.” Some fans were broken by the time Dafydd Iwan performed Yma o Hyd, a patriotic song about survival. A teardrop slowly rolled down Iwan’s cheeks as he pointed towards those in the Canton Stand singing every word back at him. One supporter consoled a blubbering friend but the most apt lasting image is the freeze-frame of Roberts celebrating behind Bale as the four Austria players in the wall, including a wincing Xaver Schlager, hands clasped behind his back, swivel in astonishment, the ball about to nestle in the top corner. That Bale goal felt ridiculous and yet at the same time almost natural. His Wales teammates have come to expect the sublime. It is why they regard free-kicks as penalties. “Cheers Gaz,” Roberts said in a tweet. “One more game.”",Sport/Football,Bale continues to lead by example in Wales’ push for 2022 World Cup | Ben Fisher,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/25/bale-continues-to-lead-by-example-in-wales-push-for-2022-world-cup
3/26/2022,"A pregnant woman injured by a high quantity of poisonous gas that was accidentally released at the aquatics centre at London’s Olympic park is planning to sue the company that runs the pool. Tess Riley, 37, who fled the pool with her husband, Thom, and their two-year-old daughter Ruby, said they “vomited our guts out” after the incident, which took place moments after a parent and toddler session in the centre’s training pool on Wednesday morning. As well as being left with the trauma of the “apocalyptic scenes”, Riley has been left fraught with anxiety over any potential impact the chlorine gas has had on her 15-week pregnancy. “I am an angry woman who is planning to sue,” she said. Riley, a former Guardian journalist, was among 29 people taken to hospital, where she was treated with oxygen in an isolation room while her clothes were placed in a contamination bag. She was observed by a team of trainee military doctors studying the effects of chemical attacks. Riley was the last to be discharged from the Royal London late on Wednesday evening. “The doctors said I had been the worst impacted,” she said. But she is yet to discover what, if any, effect the gas has had on her unborn child. London fire brigade said a “high quantity of chlorine gas” was released in the incident. But Riley needs to know whether any other gas was released on the day and so far has failed to get answers from Better, the firm which runs the centre. She is now consulting solicitors about legal action against the company. Newham council confirmed on Friday that its environmental health officers are undertaking an investigation into the accident. Riley, who like her daughter is still coughing from the incident, said: “I’m really, really concerned about the impact on my pregnancy. It has been very traumatic, I’m not sleeping.” She added: “My maternity team is waiting to hear from me about the gases that I was exposed to so that they can work out what treatment I need. The obstetrician who came to see me said ‘we don’t know how much you’ve been exposed to. We don’t know what’s built up in the placenta, and therefore we just can’t know’. So I need that information, but I don’t have it.” Two days after the incident, Riley is furious with Better for failing to contact her. “Despite putting out a lot of press guff about how they are supporting families, nobody at Better has contacted us,” she said. “I want to know what happened, how it happened, what I was exposed to, what the potential long-term health risks are and what they are doing to ensure another fuck-up like this never happens again.” She added: “I’m just amazed that the company has done absolutely bugger all and we are left in the dark about the whole thing. I want answers.” Some of those caught up in the incident reported minor breathing difficulties, but Riley said “we just couldn’t breathe” as the family were changing after their swim. She said: “We ran as fast as we could out the building. The staff on the desk looked baffled by this wall of people with toddlers in their arms running towards them coughing and retching. It was just an apocalyptic scene. There were school kids lined up outside the building who ended up needing medical help because this stuff was pouring out the building through the vents.” Riley said she saw at least two people pass out. “One woman was found slumped over her steering wheel,” she said. “I think she’d gone to her car feeling woozy.” It is understood one of the patients was struggling so much to breathe that they required intubation. Riley was taken to the Royal London after she found hyperventilating outside the centre. Other patients were taken to Newham and Homerton hospitals. Her daughter, who was coughing and screaming for two hours after the incident, was taken to the hospital’s paediatrics department where she was later discharged. Newham council said its environmental health officers are undertaking an investigation into leak. Sources close to the investigation said large quantities of chlorine were release when a delivery of hydrochloric acid was mistaken pumped into a tank containing bleach. Riley said: “If that’s what happened, why weren’t the pipes designed in such a way to prevent that? And why did it happen when the pool was being used?” Some of those caught up in the incident fled in their swimming costumes and goggles. Riley and her family were only half-dressed when it happened. The rest of her clothes as well has her keys, phone, glasses and her daughter’s pushchair remain in the aquatic centre. In a statement, GLL – which trades under the name Better – said: “Work at the London Aquatics Centre following Wednesday’s incident is ongoing and means the centre has remained closed. “We are in the process of contacting customers as it becomes possible to retrieve their personal belongings. “We understand the concern of customers but are unable to comment on specific details of the incident until the investigation is complete and we are made aware of the full details. However, the substance released was identified as chlorine gas by the London fire brigade. “Customers are advised to seek medical attention if their condition is of concern.”",News/UK news,Woman poisoned by chlorine gas leak at London’s Olympic park plans to sue,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/25/woman-injured-by-poison-gas-leak-at-london-olympic-park-plans-to-sue
