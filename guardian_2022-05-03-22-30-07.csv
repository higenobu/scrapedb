5/3/2022,"Boris Johnson has told the Ukrainian parliament that there should never be a peace settlement imposed against the will of the Ukrainian people, calling the fight to hold back Russian forces “Ukraine’s finest hour”. Speaking as the first western leader to address members of the Verkhovna Rada since the start of the conflict, Johnson said: “It is precisely because of your valour, your courage, your sacrifice, that Ukrainians now control your own destiny. “You are the masters of your fate, and no one can or should impose anything on Ukrainians. We in the UK will be guided by you and we are proud to be your friends.” He said he had “one message for you today: Ukraine will win, Ukraine will be free”. Johnson said the west should not put pressure on Ukraine for any settlement that involved relinquishing territory. “No outsider like me can speak lightly about how the conflict could be settled if only Ukraine would relinquish this or that piece or territory or we find some compromise for Vladimir Putin. “We know what happens to the people left in the clutches of this invader. And we who are your friends must be humble about what happened in 2014, because Ukraine was invaded before for the first time, when Crimea was taken from Ukraine and the war in Donbas began. “The truth is that we were too slow to grasp what was really happening and we collectively failed to impose the sanctions then that we should have put on Vladimir Putin. We cannot make the same mistake again.” Johnson said the UK would make a long-term commitment to Ukraine’s security: “We will carry on supplying Ukraine, alongside your other friends, with weapons, funding and humanitarian aid, until we have achieved our long-term goal, which must be so to fortify Ukraine that no one will ever dare to attack you again.” Ahead of the speech, Johnson announced a £300m package of military aid including electronic warfare equipment, a counter-battery radar system, GPS jamming equipment and thousands of night vision devices. Johnson addressed the parliament after being introduced by its speaker. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the UK and Ukraine were now “brothers and sisters” because of the UK’s friendship and support. The prime minister said Russian soldiers “no longer have the excuse of not knowing what they are doing” and said those troops who remained “are committing war crimes, and their atrocities emerge wherever they are forced to retreat – as we’ve seen at Bucha, at Irpin at Hostomel and many other places”. Johnson said he had refused to believe military advice that Ukraine’s army would fall within days of a Russian invasion. He said the intelligence he had received that Putin was planning an invasion had given him “a sense of horror but also of puzzlement”. He said: “There were some who believed the Kremlin propaganda that Russian armour would be like an irresistible force going like a knife through butter, and that Kyiv would fall within days. “Do you remember they said that? And people rang Volodymyr and offered him safe passage out of the country, and he said ‘no thanks’.” Johnson paid tribute to Ukraine’s armed forces, which he said were outnumbered three to one. “They fought with the energy and courage of lions. “You have exploded the myth of Putin’s invincibility and you have written one of the most glorious chapters in military history and in the life of your country. The so-called irresistible force of Putin’s war machine has broken on the immoveable object of Ukrainian patriotism and love of country. “This is Ukraine’s finest hour, that will be remembered and recounted for generations to come.”",News/World news,"‘Ukraine will be free,’ Boris Johnson tells country’s parliament",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/ukraine-will-be-free-boris-johnson-tells-parliament-verkhovna-rada
5/3/2022,"A 12-year-old orphan from Mariupol, who ended up in Russian-controlled Donetsk after being injured in a blast that killed her father, has been discharged from a children’s hospital in Kyiv to start a new life after being reunited with her grandfather. It is, perhaps, the end of the beginning of the suffering Kira Obedinsky has endured over the last two months. Before leaving the hospital on Tuesday, she was visited by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who gave her an iPad. It was a moment, said Alexsandr Obedinsky, 67, that his young granddaughter will treasure for ever. “She couldn’t believe it was happening to her. All of us need positive emotions now, and so does Kira.” Much of Kira’s life in the last two months has been barely believable. In the early weeks of Vladimir Putin’s “special military operation”, Kira had been sheltering with her father, Evgeny, and his partner, Anya, and her children, in the basement of a neighbour’s house in Mariupol. The building was hit directly, and while Kira and the others were dragged from the rubble by rescuers, Evgeny did not survive, leaving the young girl, whose mother died two weeks after her birth, an orphan. In the days after, Anya decided she had to try to get Kira and the other children out of Mariupol, but as the group walked through the debris of the shattered city, one of them stood on a mine. In the subsequent chaos, Kira ended up in the hands of Russian soldiers who took her, bleeding from shrapnel wounds to the face and body, to Donetsk’s regional hospital in a separatist-controlled part of the Donbas region. In the coming weeks, Kira even featured on Russian state television as an example of a Ukrainian civilian who was being well treated. Alexsandr received a video call from her that provided relief, but also anxiety, as reports were emerging of Ukrainian civilians being forcibly taken to Russia. The Guardian highlighted Kira’s plight in early April and a week later Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk called Alexsandr on his mobile phone. “I mean, I was trying hard, searching for someone who could help me, Ukrainian authorities and everyone I could reach,” Alexsandr said. “I knocked on all doors, the Red Cross, our government, anyone.” He went on: “Iryna Vereshchuk called me on 15 April and told me it was possible to get Kira back, but to do so I had to go to Donetsk. She asked if I was ready to do it, with safety guarantees from President Zelenskiy. I said I was ready and they took me.” Alexsandr arrived in Kyiv on 17 April to discuss logistics. “Then we went to Poland, from Poland to Turkey, from Turkey to Rostov in Russia and then from Rostov to Donetsk People’s Republic, I mean, to Donetsk,” he said. “We spent the night there and in the morning they took me to meet Kira. There was another woman with me. She also came to take back her grandson.” Recalling the moment he saw Kira, looking healthy in jeans and a sweater, Alexsandr said: “We were very emotional, both of us.” The reunited pair took the same route back to Kyiv, arriving on 26 April. Kira was then admitted to Ohmatdyt children’s hospital where Zelenskiy made a surprise visit and gave her his gift. Alexsandr has not talked to Kira about the death of her father. “She doesn’t like taking about that, and I also don’t want to discuss unnecessarily,” he said. “Psychotherapists are working with her. She is OK considering what she lived through.” For now, the future is the focus. “Yes, I adopted her and I’m her official guardian now, so she’ll live with me, we’ll be together,” Alexsandr said. “We’ll stay in Chernivtsi [a city in south-western Ukraine] for now, and I don’t know what [the] future holds for us. We’ll see how life turns out.”",News/World news,Orphaned girl taken by Russian soldiers reunited with grandfather,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/orphaned-girl-taken-by-russian-soldiers-reunited-with-grandfather
5/3/2022,"Last week, Trinidadian writer Lisa Allen-Agostini’s novel The Bread the Devil Knead, landed a coveted spot on the Women’s prize shortlist. As a fellow Trinidadian writer, this is both exciting and unsurprising. These days Trinidad is producing world-class female writers hand over fist. Allen-Agostini’s shortlisting comes on the heels of the announcement, two weeks ago, that Trinidadian writer, Amanda Smyth, made the Walter Scott prize for historical fiction shortlist, the only woman on the list, and the first Caribbean writer ever to be chosen. Meanwhile, Celeste Mohammed has become the fifth woman (and third Trinidadian woman) to win Trinidad’s regional OCM Bocas prize. Something has happened in Trinidad, in our small but dense hothouse of a literary world. Perhaps it’s 12 years of the Bocas literary festival, or five waves of feminism, or maybe it’s to do with the internet opening up opportunities for those from developing countries, but in the last decade Trinidad has produced a host of outstanding female writers. It’s a trend that anyone in Caribbean literary circles knows about. Myself, Smyth, Allen-Agostini, Mohammed and others, are part of a “lit-boom”, and most of this boom is female. We are finding ourselves on the global stage, on prestigious shortlists in North America and the UK. This huge generational and gender shift would have been unthinkable only 15 years ago. What makes this upsurge in our female literary talent so exquisitely satisfying is that not long ago in 2011, Trinidad’s most famous writer, supernova VS Naipaul, scorned women who write. During an interview with the Royal Geographic Society, he said, “I read a piece of writing and within a paragraph or two I know whether it is by a woman or not. I think [it is] unequal to me.” He went on, to say this was because of women’s “narrow and sentimental view of the world”. Today, I hope Naipaul is turning in his grave – because Trinidad’s women are not just writing, but we’re winning prizes for it. Last year saw Ingrid Persaud win the Costa first novel award with Love After Love, while my novel, The Mermaid of Black Conch, won the Costa Book of the Year in 2020. Before these wins, Vahni Capildeo, (a relative of Naipaul’s) took the Forward prize in 2016 for Measures of Expatriation. In 2017, Shivanee Ramlochan’s debut collection Everyone Knows I Am a Haunting was shortlisted for the Forward poetry prize. And in 2018, Claire Adam’s Golden Child won a host of prizes on both sides of the Atlantic, including the Desmond Elliott prize. Many more female Trini writers are emerging as I write: readers can expect an avalanche. There’s Ayanna Lloyd Banwo (her novel When We Were Birds is currently on tour), Ira Mathur, Alake Pilgrim, Hadassah K Williams, Breanne Mc Ivor, Judy Raymond, Desiree Seebaran. It’s like someone has turned on a tap. The OCM Bocas festival, launched in 2011, has been critical to this upsurge. Not only does Bocas showcase Caribbean writers, but it is committed to nurturing talent via workshops and longer mentoring schemes. Bocas has given Trinidad’s fledgling writers a structure, something to lean into. It brings our emerging writers into contact with the region’s established writers. In short, it has given us all confidence. Then there is Trinidad itself. I call it “the place”. Charismatic, polyglot, sexycool, rife with corruption and discontent, cursed with anti-LGBT colonial laws, only just free from child marriage, a place where one in three women know domestic violence, divided historically and racially along African and Indian lines; it is a place to write about. It’s also a place to celebrate; we own carnival, calypso, once an international film festival and today a top-notch literary festival. We are a multifarious racial mix, and our writers reflect this: Muslim, Christian, Buddhist, Hindu, African, Indian, European. Our current wave of talent reflects no single narrative. It is a place of fusion and globalisation by means of colonisation, immigration and indenture. It’s hardly surprising, then, that Trinidad has spawned many famous writers: VS Naipaul, CLR James, Earl Lovelace, Sam Selvon to name a few. But the pendulum has swung. There’s been a gender quake: the present and the future, in terms of Trinidad’s literary output, is female.",Arts/Books,‘The pendulum has swung’: Why we female Trinidadian writers are having our moment,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/03/why-we-female-trinidadian-writers-are-having-our-moment-monique-roffey
5/3/2022,"Protesters gathered outside the US supreme court on Monday night to decry reports the court will overturn abortion rights provided under the 1973 Roe vs Wade ruling. Pro-choice protesters lit candles and shouted expletives about Samuel Alito, the rightwing justice who wrote the opinion that was leaked to Politico. In the opinion, Alito wrote that Roe was “egregiously wrong from the start” and that the US constitution “does not prohibit the citizens of each state from regulating or prohibiting abortion”. The crowd of about 200 people chanted “Abortion is healthcare” and some carried signs reading “Justices get out of my vagina”, “Legal abortion once and for all” and “We won’t go back”. A smaller group of anti-abortion protesters were present, chanting “Hey, hey, ho, ho, Roe v Wade has got to go”, leading to tense exchanges between the two groups. Barriers were erected in front of the court shortly after the leaked report was made public. “I absolutely have to be out here because this is something affects me so personally and hurts so much to know this might be ripped away from me,” Juliette Molz, one of the protesters, told NBC. Others were stunned by the leaked opinion. “I’m shocked. I hope that it was, just a headline that wasn’t true, but you know, I think there might be some truth to it,” said Leysha Caraballo. Overturning the landmark ruling would allow states that have attempted to severely restrict women’s access to reproductive healthcare to ban abortion. The case before the court, brought by Mississippi, is expected to be officially decided in the summer. Abortion has long been a contentious issue in the US, even though polling finds that a clear majority of the public believes it should be legal. The supreme court, however, has a 6-3 majority of deeply conservative justices. Three of those justices were nominated by Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton, whose defeat by Trump in the 2016 election paved the way for the rightwing tilt of the court, said the apparent decision was a “direct assault” on the rights and lives of women, as well as settled law. “It will kill and subjugate women even as a vast majority of Americans think abortion should be legal,” she said. “What an utter disgrace.” Several leading progressives, including Senator Bernie Sanders, have called for a vote in Congress to enshrine the right to abortion in law. Such a vote would have to navigate an evenly split Senate.",News/World news,Protesters stake out supreme court over draft abortion ruling ‘disgrace’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/us-supreme-court-abortion-protesters-roe-v-wade
5/3/2022,"What are the best recipes using tinned fruit?Georgie, Hastings There’s more to tinned fruit than a heavy dose of nostalgia: it’s cheap, available all year round, regardless of the season, and a friend to many bakes. Case in point: pears work a treat nestled in chocolate batter, as do apricots baked tatin-style on top of, or under, puff pastry. Or follow Jack Monroe’s lead in Tin Can Cook and embrace the good old fruit cocktail by tipping a tin into a classic cake batter. Guardian baker Ravneet Gill is especially partial to tinned pineapple: “I love it, and you can use it in so many things.” It’s as at home in an upside-down cake as in a granita (made from the tin juices, sugar and lime juice), Gill adds. “Tinned pineapple also stands up well to being baked, so put it in a crumble or cobbler.” Or go for a cross between the two with a dump cake: Gill’s pineapple and peach version appeared here a few weeks ago, but essentially you combine the two fruits in a baking dish, top with a dry cake mix (flour, baking powder, caster sugar, cornflour, salt) and slices of butter, pop in the oven and bake until golden. Job done. Tinned fruit isn’t just for sweets, though. Gill turns pineapple into a quick pickle: “Tip out the juice and drink it, add sugar and lime juice [or white-wine vinegar] to the fruit, mix, stir in some chopped chilli and set aside.” Gill uses it to top curries, but you could also, of course, put tinned fruit in a curry – aubergine and pineapple, say, or Monroe’s peach and chickpea number. For the latter, Monroe cooks chopped onion, garlic and curry powder in oil, then adds chopped tinned peaches and their juice, chickpeas, chopped tomatoes and a crumbled stock cube. Cook gently for half an hour, and add a little water if things get a bit thick. Tinned cherries, meanwhile, are ripe for pickling. In Tin Can Magic, Jessica Elliott Dennison drains the fruit (she saves the juice for sodas), then mixes with red-wine vinegar and a pinch of salt. Eat in salads, such as beetroot and walnut (“the tart sweetness contrasts so nicely with the earthiness of the beetroot”), or use to top chocolate mousse. Meanwhile, Princes’ cherry pie filling is something of a staple round Gill’s house: “It’s so good, so reliable, and I use it all the time.” That might be in a black forest gateau, adding a dollop to puff pastry before deep-frying, or swirling through cake batters. Fresh cherries are expensive, so Gill suggests bulking them out with tinned for, say, a cherry pie. Bonus: less pitting equals less mess. Tinned mango pulp, be it kesar or alphonso, is worth a mention, too. “It’s a really good ingredient and about £1 a tin,” says Gill, who adds it to cheesecakes, souffles and ice-creams. Alternatively, whizz up a mango lassi for breakfast: in the Dishoom cookbook, mango is blended with a banana, coconut milk, thick Greek yoghurt, oats, honey, cumin seeds, sea salt and ice cubes, until smooth.

5/3/2022,"The Rugby Football Union chief executive, Bill Sweeney, is in hospital after suffering a pulmonary embolism. The 64-year-old was admitted to hospital last Friday and is expected to make a full recovery. The union said that Sweeney, who was appointed to the role in 2019, will recuperate for the next few weeks, initially at hospital before returning home. He is said to be in “good spirits” and intends to return to work once he has recovered. In his absence, the RFU’s executive team will assume Sweeney’s duties, working closely with the chair, Tom Ilube, and the rest of the board. Sweeney will not be in Dublin next week for World Rugby’s council meeting when England are expected to be confirmed as the hosts of the 2025 women’s World Cup. His absence will be further felt given he has also been playing a key role in discussions over revamping the global calendar and remodelling the July and November international Test windows. In March, Sweeney gave Eddie Jones his firm backing to continue as England’s head coach despite another lacklustre showing during this year’s Six Nations in which the side managed just two wins for the second successive campaign. An RFU statement read: “Bill Sweeney was admitted to hospital on Friday and he is being treated for a pulmonary embolism.

5/3/2022,"New homes have a dwindling amount of green space because property developers claim they cannot afford to build parks, research has found. Analysis from the New Economics Foundation (NEF) looked at data from the Office for National Statistics, data on the average age of local housing stock from Datadaptive and national survey data on public perceptions of local green space from the government agency Natural England. It found that compared with the mid-20th century, the amount of green space near new developments in England and Wales has declined since 2000. For example, in neighbourhoods where most of the housing was built between 1930 and 1939, the median size of a neighbourhood’s nearest park was about 61,500 sq metres. The equivalent figure for developments dominated by post-2000 housing is 36,200 sq metres – a 40% decline. And between 2013 and 2021 the proportion of parks deemed to be in “good condition” slipped from 60% to just over 40%. Dr Alex Chapman, a senior researcher at the NEF, said property developers had the upper hand in negotiations with councils over green space provision. He told the Guardian: “The broader planning arrangements around new developments mean developers can cite financial viability as a factor. If the council says it needs to build a huge park alongside the development the developer will say that it’s not financially viable. “Sometimes the council can challenge this, but because of the pressure to build new houses from central government, the appeal will fail. The council won’t want to take part in a drawn out legal pursuit because they know they are on the back foot.” Chapman pointed out that many large housing developers have a profit margin of about 15%, so there is room to invest in the property they build to make it better for those who live in and around it. Instead, this profit goes to shareholders. “The golden age of building large parks near to homes was also the golden age of council housebuilding and I don’t think that’s a coincidence,” he said. Not only are new parks not being created, existing parks lack legal protection, so are being built on by developers. Chapman said: “Some of these developments being picked up by us are infill – some of these developments are being built on what would have been someone’s green space. This could be because the parks do not have legal status or protection, so they can be built on.” One in three people in England do not have nature near their home, with little or no green space at all in some of the most disadvantaged areas. Visiting nature has proved to be important to wellbeing and health but access to it is decreasing. Analysis by the NEF found the decline in new green space provision after 2000 can now be associated with at least 9m fewer trips to green space a year, and those living in developments built after 2000 were about 5% less likely to visit green space once a week after other key variables (deprivation, age and dog ownership) were accounted for. The NEF is supporting a petition calling for a legal right to nature.",News/Cities,Parks near new homes shrink 40% as developers say they cannot afford them,https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2022/may/03/green-space-decline-housing-developer-england-wales-plead-poverty-research-finds
5/3/2022,"Obesity has reached “epidemic proportions” in Europe, the World Health Organization says, as a major report shows the disease is causing 200,000 cancer cases and 1.2 million deaths a year. In the first such study for 15 years, the WHO said overweight and obesity rates had hit deadly levels and were “still escalating”. No country in the region was on track to meet the WHO global noncommunicable disease (NCD) target of halting the rise of obesity by 2025, it said. Across Europe, 59% of adults are overweight or obese as well as 8% of children under five and one in three children of school age. Obesity prevalence in Europe is higher than in any other part of the world except the Americas, according to the report presented at the European Congress on Obesity. “Alarmingly, there have been consistent increases in the prevalence of overweight and obesity in the WHO European region and no member state is on track to reach the target of halting the rise in obesity by 2025,” the report said. Obesity is linked to a string of other diseases, including musculoskeletal complications, type 2 diabetes, heart disease and at least 13 types of cancer. The report said excess body fat led to premature death and was a leading risk factor for disability. “Across the WHO European region, obesity is likely to be directly responsible for at least 200,000 new cancer cases annually, with this figure projected to rise in the coming decades,” the report said. “For some countries within the region, it is predicted that obesity will overtake smoking as the main risk factor for preventable cancer.” Of all the countries in the Europe region, the UK ranks fourth for having the most overweight and obese adults, behind Israel, Malta and Turkey, according to the study. Obesity is defined as being very overweight. Having a body mass index (BMI) of 25 to 29.9 is classified as being overweight, while 30 or above is defined as obese. The report found European men were more likely to be overweight or obese overall, although more women were living with obesity (24%) in Europe than men (22%). People living with obesity had been disproportionately affected by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the report said. There have been unfavourable shifts in food consumption and physical activity patterns that will have lasting effects on people’s health for many years and will need significant effort to reverse. The report said the causes of obesity were more complex than just an unhealthy diet and physical inactivity. It said that “environmental factors unique to living in modern Europe’s highly digitalised societies are also drivers of obesity”, such as online marketing of unhealthy food to children, and the “proliferation of sedentary online gaming”. Dr Hans Kluge, the WHO regional director for Europe, said reversing the obesity epidemic in Europe was still possible. “By creating environments that are more enabling, promoting investment and innovation in health, and developing strong and resilient health systems, we can change the trajectory of obesity in the region.” The report called for high-level political commitment to tackling obesity, alongside measures such as sugar taxes on sugary drinks and subsidies on healthy food. Marketing of unhealthy food to children must end, it said. Other measures included limiting “the proliferation of takeaway outlets in low-income neighbourhoods”, baby food being properly labelled and nutritional food standards in settings such as nurseries being put into law, the study said. One other idea, aimed at teenagers, would be to frame healthy eating as a “strategy to achieve collective action against climate change”, while workplaces should also offer wellbeing programmes to help people improve their physical health, the report said.",News/Society,"Obesity ‘epidemic’ leading to 1.2m deaths a year in Europe, says WHO",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/03/obesity-epidemic-proportions-across-europe-world-health-organization-who
5/3/2022,"Aplay about insomnia is welcome relief for many of us who stew, bug-eyed, into the small hours and know that sleeplessness bears its own maddening drama. Directed by Mike Alfreds, it begins promisingly, with five characters in pyjamas making snarky asides about other people’s useless advice for their malaise (yoga, magnesium flakes, breathing and body scans). They pull up chairs and begin speaking in alternating snatches of their nightly torments, daily burdens, former lives and past loves. The central conceit around the lack of sleep and its effects is disappointingly underexplored and seems, instead, like an excuse for characters to give us personal histories and disjointed vignettes. They do not interact with each other but give us thoughts and memories in isolation; as one talks the others recline in states of anguish – head in hands, slumped, hugging a chair or the wall. Mystifyingly, they speak of themselves in the first and third person, sometimes switching between the two in the same sentence, which is jarring and brings oddness to the storytelling. The play’s characters and script were devised by several company actors at ViSiBLE Theatre Ensemble, which focuses on creating work about later life. It is refreshing to see five characters – and actors – of a certain age on stage. Some speak of holding on to their working lives, others look back at it wistfully, and occasionally they refer to the far bigger sleep of their own mortality, though we want more of this contemplation too. Helen (Sally Knyvette) is a plummy woman who is proud of her kitchen extension and ruminates on her schooldays; Bill (Vincenzo Nicoli) is a failed actor who becomes a chef but crumbles when he loses his second job; Hugo (Gary Lilburn) is an Irish artist who self-medicates with drink and pills; Terry (Geraldine Alexander) has been her mother’s carer for the past decade while Harvey (Andrew Hawkins) is a teacher forced into retirement. The women on the whole stick to reminiscing about friends and family while the men spend more time remembering infidelities and sexual encounters. Their monologues, ironically, have their own soporific moments as Terry complains about the ironing, Helen goes over incidents at her school while Harvey rants about neoliberalism and past governments. The sad and dramatic parts of their lives – the death of a daughter, heartbreak, divorce – do not have the effect they should, and this play ultimately comes to feel like five character studies in search of a more joined-up story.

5/3/2022,"My wonderful new wife is everything I have always looked for in a woman. The issue is that she is openly and proudly bisexual. When we first became involved, she even joked that she didn’t want me getting mad when it was time for her to visit her friend on girls’ trips. A threesome with a bisexual woman has always been my fantasy. She even gave me permission to go online and find a “unicorn” for us. But when I set up a meeting, she didn’t seem to want to follow through with it, so I stopped looking. Recently, on holiday, she made a sexual comment about a girl in a bikini, so I again brought up the idea of a threesome. But she said she might have grown out of that phase of her life and just wants to be with me. She also said that adding another person would ruin the marriage, and I worry that things might change between us if we get together with another girl. I am at a loss as to what to do. If she is truly bisexual, I am worried that if those desires are not met, she may pursue them without me. My only rule is that if she is with a girl, I am also present. Most guys would love my situation – am I making this harder than it is? Listen to your wife. It is true that bringing another person into a relationship can be risky, and needs to be carefully negotiated and managed. And you don’t have to protect her bisexual interests – if she really wants to have sex with another woman, she will make that decision herself. Being bisexual does not necessarily mean one is interested in threesomes. You seem to have assumed it does, but it could be that the last thing your wife wants is to include you during sex with another woman. She implied this early on by saying she did not want you to get upset when she went off on a girls’ trip. It is also possible that your wife really is no longer interested in turning her bisexual fantasies into reality. All this is worth a frank conversation. Make sure you avoid blame or judgment, listen carefully, and help her to feel safe to educate you about her true sexual identity.

5/3/2022,"Supporters of abortion rights reacted with outrage to the leak on Monday night of a supreme court decision overturning Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling which has safeguarded the right till now. According to Politico, the draft ruling, written by Samuel Alito, is supported by Clarence Thomas and the three conservative justices appointed by Donald Trump: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. It would also overturn Planned Parenthood v Casey, a 1992 decision which upheld Roe. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House, said: “If the report is accurate, the supreme court is poised to inflict the greatest restriction of rights in the past 50 years – not just on women but on all Americans. “The Republican-appointed justices’ reported votes to overturn Roe v Wade would go down as an abomination, one of the worst and most damaging decisions in modern history,” Pelosi said. “Several of these conservative justices, who are in no way accountable to the American people, have lied to the US Senate, ripped up the constitution and defiled both precedent and the supreme court’s reputation.” Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts senator and former candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, said an “extremist supreme court” was poised to “impose its far-right, unpopular views on the entire country. “It’s time for the millions who support the constitution and abortion rights to stand up and make their voices heard,” she said. “We’re not going back – not ever.” If confirmed, the ruling would make abortion rights a state matter. As many as 26 Republican-run states are poised to end or restrict access. Congress could codify Roe into law but it would require scrapping the filibuster, the Senate rule that requires a 60-vote majority for most legislation. That seems unlikely, given the 50-50 split in the chamber and opposition from moderate Democrats such as Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Republican senators including Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who have expressed concern over abortion rights, were slower to react to the Politico report than their Democratic counterparts. Their support would be needed for filibuster reform. Among progressives, outrage was fierce. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York congresswoman, tied her outrage to calls for Senate reform and to impeach Thomas, the senior conservative on the court, over the political activities of his wife around the January 6 insurrection. Ocasio-Cortez also warned of possible court moves on other hitherto protected rights. “[The court] isn’t just coming for abortion – they’re coming for the right to privacy Roe rests on, which includes gay marriage and civil rights. “Manchin is blocking Congress codifying Roe. House has seemingly forgotten about Clarence Thomas. These two points must change.” Ocasio-Cortez also took aim at Joe Biden, calling for the use of executive actions. “People elected Democrats precisely so we could lead in perilous moments like these – to codify Roe, hold corruption accountable and have a president who uses his legal authority to break through congressional gridlock on items from student debt to climate. It’s high time we do it. “If we don’t, what message does that send? We can’t sit around, finger-point and hand-wring as people’s futures and equality are on the line. It’s time to be decisive, lead with confidence, fight for a prosperous future for all and protect the vulnerable. Leave it all on the field.” Campaigners were equally vocal. The National Women’s Law Center called the “language in the draft opinion … outrageous, irresponsible and shocking”. Alexis McGill Johnson, president of the women’s health provider Planned Parenthood, called the draft ruling “horrifying and unprecedented”. Laphonza Butler, president of the advocacy group Emily’s List, pointed to the effect the draft ruling could have on Democratic campaigning and turnout in the November midterm elections. “For years, anti-choice politicians have worked overtime to strip away our fundamental rights and give government control of critical healthcare decisions. They are working to ban abortion, full stop. This was the plan all along. “It’s past time to vote out every official who stands against the pro-choice majority. “We will fight harder than ever to make them pay, by electing more Democratic pro-choice women at all levels of government who will protect our rights and ensure that our abortion rights do not depend on our zip code or our financial situation. And we will work to vote every one of them out.” Cecile Richards, formerly president of Planned Parenthood, pointed to polling which shows clear support for abortion rights. “This is not what the American people want,” she said. “This is Republican politicians putting government in charge of your pregnancy. Full stop.”",News/World news,‘An abomination’: Pelosi leads outcry on supreme court draft abortion ruling,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/supreme-court-roe-v-wade-draft-abortion-ruling
5/3/2022,"Sir Jim Ratcliffe has not given up hope of hijacking the deal to buy Chelsea, despite Todd Boehly’s consortium being selected as the club’s preferred bidder, and has held talks with supporter groups to outline his vision for the club. Boehly’s group are in the middle of a five-day exclusivity period and remain the favourites to buy Chelsea, who want to open contract talks with Mason Mount and Reece James once a takeover has been completed. The terms of a deal for the club could be agreed with Roman Abramovich this week. However Ratcliffe’s £4.25bn bid last Friday is a potential complication. The British billionaire’s late offer was revealed while Raine, the US bank handling the sale, was telling the three shortlisted contenders that Boehly’s group were the preferred bidders, and the 69-year-old is not prepared to walk away yet. A source close to Abramovich cautioned against writing off Ratcliffe, whose involvement explains why Raine has not publicly confirmed Boehly has beaten competition from consortiums led by Sir Martin Broughton and Steve Pagliuca. Ratcliffe, who owns the British petrochemicals company Ineos, signalled his seriousness by meeting the Chelsea Supporters’ Trust last weekend. He insisted he would be in it for the long term, revealed plans to raise Stamford Bridge’s capacity to 60,000 and said he wanted to turn Chelsea into the Real Madrid or Bayern Munich of London. A Trust spokesperson said: “While the CST has had initial talks with Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his team, no further meeting is yet in the diary.” The likelihood remains that Boehly’s consortium, which includes his fellow LA Dodgers owner Mark Walter, the Swiss billionaire Hansjörg Wyss, the British property developer Jonathan Goldstein and the US investment firm Clearlake Capital, will become Chelsea’s new owners. However Ratcliffe, who offered to pay £2.5bn for Chelsea and pledged to invest £1.75bn over the next 10 years, is poised if talks with Boehly break down. Pagliuca’s and Broughton’s consortiums are also on standby. Eyebrows have been raised at Ratcliffe making his bid two weeks after the deadline and bypassing the rules set by Raine. A source close to a rival bidder said it would be unprofessional for Ratcliffe, who made his offer after talks with Chelsea’s chairman, Bruce Buck, to be considered. Chelsea, who will need to ask the government for a new licence to complete the sale, will be keen to avoid further delays. Their operating licence runs out on 31 May and the sanctions imposed on Abramovich have affected Thomas Tuchel’s side, who risk being dragged into a battle to finish in the top four after losing three of their past six league games. The sanctions have stopped Chelsea from selling or buying players and mean they cannot hand out new contracts. The uncertainty has played a part in Antonio Rüdiger’s impending move to Real Madrid on a free transfer, creating unrest in the dressing room, and has led to rival clubs exploring the possibility of signing Mount and James. Boehly’s group are aware of the need to start contract talks with James and Mount. The duo are two of the best players to emerge from Chelsea’s academy and are unlikely to want to leave but there is a need to ensure they do not begin to feel undervalued. Mount has two years left on his deal and although the midfielder is seen as a future Chelsea captain he is one of their lowest-paid players. The 23-year-old, one of Tuchel’s most important players, earns about £70,000 a week. Romelu Lukaku, whose future is increasingly uncertain, earns more than £300,000 a week. Sources have warned that Chelsea could run into unnecessary problems if they play hardball with Mount. Insiders say the club must avoid a repeat of the situation with Rüdiger. The commanding centre-back earns about £90,000 a week and felt his performances merited a lucrative pay rise, only for negotiations to break down. James, who has three years left on a deal worth about £100,000 a week, is attracting interest from top European clubs. Chelsea will not want to do anything that would risk upsetting Tuchel. They are set to lose Andreas Christensen on a free to Barcelona, who are also hopeful of signing Marcos Alonso and César Azpilicueta. Tuchel will need to spend heavily on his defence and there are also issues in midfield, with Jorginho and N’Golo Kanté out of contract next year. Jorginho is a target for Juventus. In attack there are doubts over Christian Pulisic, Hakim Ziyech and Timo Werner. Pulisic has two years on his deal and is unhappy about his lack of playing time. Lukaku could also be allowed to leave after the £97.5m striker failed to make it off the bench during Chelsea’s defeat by Everton.",Sport/Football,Jim Ratcliffe holds talks with Chelsea fan groups as he refuses to give up hope,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/03/jim-ratcliffe-talks-chelsea-fan-groups-todd-boely-buy-club-abramovich
5/3/2022,"Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK has urged the home secretary to relax the “unnecessary, long, bureaucratic” visa scheme for those fleeing war, as thousands of Ukrainians remain stranded in Europe. Vadym Prystaiko said he was negotiating with Priti Patel to temporarily lift visa requirements that he said had left many Ukrainians waiting in European towns such as Calais. He said: “Now it’s time maybe for a temporary [relaxation of visa requirements] just to relieve people from this unnecessary, long, bureaucratic and difficult bureaucratic procedures. We are constantly working with the Home Office trying to rebalance this system, trying to find better solutions, but something like temporary relief from visas will help us a lot.” It came as the Guardian revealed the home secretary was facing mass legal action over the “chaotic” Homes for Ukraine backlog, which has left thousands of people waiting for weeks after uploading all their paperwork and undergoing biometric scans. According to the latest government figures, 59,000 people have had visas approved but have not yet arrived in the UK. Only 15% of the 74,700 Ukrainians who applied under the sponsorship route have made it to Britain. Many people who submitted applications more than six weeks ago, when the scheme launched, are among those apparently lost in the system. Boris Johnson admitted on Monday that the UK could have moved faster to help Ukrainians reach safety. In an interview on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, he said the government had “done a huge amount to help Ukrainian women and children in the area but we’re now seeing large numbers come to the UK”. The UK has so far taken in 27,000 Ukrainians overall, which the prime minister said was “a lot and it’s growing fast”, but he added: “Could we have done it faster? Yes, perhaps we could.” Asked why the UK was not offering visa-free travel to Ukrainians, Johnson said that in a wartime situation, some people may be “pretending” to be refugees. He said: “It’s important to protect the system from those who might want to abuse it. It’s also important to protect the women and children from coming to somewhere where they’re not going to get the welcome that we would want, so that’s why the screening and all the work we’ve done to make sure that we match up people in the right way, and the results are starting to be really excellent, you’re seeing large numbers now.” The UK is an outlier in Europe in requiring Ukrainians to submit to a lengthy visa process before they can travel. This has meant children without international passports, including months-old babies, being required to undergo security scans in Poland before they can fly to safety. Prystaiko said he had asked Patel directly to relax the process temporarily. He said: “Ukrainians are coming here and in most of the cases have been waiting in European towns next to you, like in Calais … because we enjoy the visa-free regime with the rest of Europe and unfortunately we never had it with Great Britain.”",News/UK news,Ukraine ambassador urges Priti Patel to relax UK visa scheme,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/03/ukraine-ambassador-urges-priti-patel-relax-uk-visa-scheme
