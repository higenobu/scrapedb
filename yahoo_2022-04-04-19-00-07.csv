4/4/2022,"Germany is considering nationalizing Gazprom and Rosneft units in the country. The two Russian energy giants have a significant footprint in Germany. Germany, Europe's largest economy, is heavily reliant on Russia for natural gas. Germany is considering nationalizing Gazprom and Rosneft units in the country, business newspaper Handelsblatt reported, citing government sources. The two Russian energy giants have a significant footprint in Europe's largest economy, with Gazprom Germania running gas-storage facilities and Rosneft Deutschland accounting for one-quarter of Germany's refinery business, per Handelsblatt. Berlin is also considering expropriating Gazprom assets by forcing the giant to sell its gas-storage facilities across Germany, Politico reported on Friday, citing a government official and two other people briefed on the plans. Plans to nationalize Gazprom and Rosneft units in Germany — which Handelsblatt first reported on Thursday — were met with approval from the ruling coalition, the business daily further reported on Sunday. ""The situation is serious and requires extraordinary measures,"" said Bernd Westphal, an energy parliamentary group spokesperson from Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats party, per Handelsblatt. If the energy companies were nationalized, they would come under the control of German authorities, thereby loosening Russian influence on energy security in Germany and better ensuring supply continuity. The move comes as Germany seeks to bolster the country's energy security amid the Ukraine war. Last week, Germany activated an emergency plan to deal with disruptions to its natural-gas supply after Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded payment in rubles. Germany is now in the ""early warning phase"" of its energy emergency plan, with Berlin calling for all consumers — from industry to households — to conserve energy and reduce consumption. If the situation worsens, the country may start rationing gas in the last of the three-stage plan with industry first in line for power cuts, as outlined by Germany's economy ministry. The move could devastate the economy and lead to job losses. Russian gas accounted for 55% of Germany's gas imports in 2021 and 40% of its gas imports in the first quarter of 2022, Reuters reported. The country has pledged to end the use of Russian gas by 2024, economy minister Robert Habeck said in a March 25 press release. Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov has spoked out against reports that Berlin may nationalize Gazprom and Rosneft's units, saying it would be against international law, Reuters reported on Friday. Germany is not the only country that has considered nationalizing Russian energy assets since the war in Ukraine began. In March, the Financial Times and Bloomberg reported that the UK was preparing to temporarily nationalize Gazprom's British retail supply unit, as it was in danger of collapsing and causing supply disruption. The UK's move appeared to be designed, the FT reported, to save Gazprom unit itself as customers abandoned it over the war in Ukraine. Berlin is also considering restructuring options for Wingas, a unit of Gazprom, Bloomberg reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter. Wingas supplies about one-fifth of the German gas market, per Bloomberg. Meanwhile, Gazprom announced on Friday it has terminated its participation in Gazprom Germania and all of its assets, including Gazprom Marketing and Trading, S&P Global Commodity Insights reported, citing a statement. Germany's economy ministry, Gazprom Germania, and Rosneft Deutschland did not immediately respond to Insider's requests for comment, which were sent outside regular business hours.

4/4/2022,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - An Indonesian court handed down a death sentence on Monday to a teacher for raping 13 girls at an Islamic school, upholding an appeal by prosecutors for the death penalty after he had initially received a sentence of life in prison. The case of teacher Herry Wirawan has shocked Indonesia and shone a spotlight on the need to protect children from sexual violence in the country's religious boarding schools. After he was sentenced to life in jail by a court in the city of Bandung in February, prosecutors who had called for the death penalty filed an appeal. ""(We) hereby punish the defendant with the death penalty,"" the judge said in a statement on Monday posted on the Bandung High Court's website. Ira Mambo, Herry's lawyer, declined to comment on whether there would be an appeal, citing a need to see the full ruling from the court. A spokesperson for the local prosecutor's office also said it would wait to receive the final ruling before commenting. Between 2016 and 2021, Herry sexually groomed the 13 girls, who were between 12 and 16 years old, and impregnated eight of his victims, a judge said in February. Indonesian officials, including the country's child protection minister, had also backed calls for the death penalty, though the nation's human rights commission, which opposes the death penalty, said it was not appropriate. Indonesia, the world's biggest Muslim majority country, has tens of thousands of Islamic boarding schools and other religious schools that often provide the only way for the children of poorer families to get an education.

4/4/2022,"Maggie Drew’s dad sent her to Circle of Hope Girls’ Ranch in Missouri in 2007, hoping strict Christian teachings would stop his 14-year-old daughter’s teenage rebellion. Instead, Drew said, she found herself in a nightmare, sexually abused by one of the boarding school's founders and left with permanent spinal injuries after a fall from a hay barn for which she received no medical attention. Just 25 miles away at another Christian boarding school, Brett Harper says he endured abuse that included staff members stomping on his back. He said his injuries required two spinal surgeries and left him disabled. They are among dozens of people who say they were abused at either Circle of Hope or Agape Boarding School — allegations that helped prompt a new Missouri law aimed at reining in religious boarding schools that for decades went without any oversight by the state. “I still have nightmares about these people and the things they did to us,” Drew said. The founders of Circle of Hope face around 100 charges, some alleging sexual abuse. Agape's doctor is charged with child sex crimes and five employees are accused of assault, though Missouri’s attorney general thinks many more workers should have been charged. The schools are unrelated and are not affiliated with any particular Christian denomination. But both opened in southwest Missouri under a 1982 state law that gave religious boarding schools free rein and the state no way to monitor how kids were educated. Even the health department had no oversight, including for schools that claimed to address mental health, behavioral and addiction issues. The new law approved last year followed extensive reporting from The Kansas City Star that found that several faith-based boarding schools, including Agape, relocated to Missouri after being investigated or shut down for abuse or neglect elsewhere. Legislators heard testimony from former students such as Chanel Mare, who told of girls at Circle of Hope being forced to eat their own vomit; and James Matthew Lawson, who said he was raped at Agape and called “seizure boy” because of his epilepsy. The Associated Press generally does not name victims of sexual abuse, but Larson and Drew both came forward publicly to discuss the allegations. Supporters of religious boarding schools say they provide structure to troubled young people. Megan Stokes, executive director of National Association of Therapeutic Schools and Programs, said the wrongdoing alleged at Agape and Circle of Hope is exceedingly uncommon. Yet unlike Missouri and many other states, her trade association requires state licensing for all of its 150 member schools, including the religious ones. Agape is not a member, nor was Circle of Hope. Boyd and Stephanie Householder opened Circle of Hope in 2006 in the remote town of Humansville. “We use the BIBLE to teach (girls) that they are to obey their Parents and the authority over them,” the school’s website, which has been taken down, stated. The school closed amid a 2020 investigation; 25 girls were removed. In March 2021, Boyd Householder, 72, was charged with 79 crimes and Stephanie, 56, was charged with 22. Sixteen former residents alleged they were restrained with handcuffs, whipped with belts, and punched. Nearly two dozen counts against Boyd Householder accuse him of sexual contact with girls. Messages left with the Householders' attorney were not returned. In an August interview with the Star, the couple said the accusers made up their stories. Drew, now 29, said her life was upended when her brother died in a car wreck in 2007. Her grieving father joined a church in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. Drew said that when she refused to wear a skirt and her grades dropped, church leaders persuaded her dad to send her to Circle of Hope. “It was absolute torture,” said Drew, who also accused the Householders of stealing a $25,000 inheritance from her. James Clemensen, a retired California trooper, and his wife, Kathy, started Agape in Stockton, Missouri, in 1990. He told a reporter in 2002 that he picked Missouri because of its lack of regulation. He died in October. Agape serves 120-150 boys ages 12-17. Its website says it's a nonprofit school ""designed to show God’s love to teen boys struggling with behavior issues that can threaten their future.” The school remains open. Five staffers were charged in September with abusing students. In December, Dr. David Smock was charged with sexual abuse. He pleaded not guilty in March. Phone messages left with Agape’s director and Smock's attorney were not returned. Harper was 14 when he was sent there from his rural Oregon home in 1999. Now 36, he recalled long hours moving large rocks from one pile to another, toting lumber by hand and clearing land. Harper said his injuries have left him unable to keep a job. “What I went through at Agape primed me for abusive relationships with people, it primed for being an ignorant young man not knowing the way the world worked, it destroyed my family relationship,” Harper said. Missouri's new law sets minimum health and safety requirements for boarding schools, which still don't have to be licensed. The law mandates background checks for employees; requires adequate food, clothing and medical care for students; and says parents must be allowed access to their children at any time without prior notice. After a state investigation last year, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt recommended charges against 22 Agape employees. But in Missouri, only the local prosecutor can file charges, and Cedar County Prosecuting Attorney Ty Gaither does not plan to file more. “The attorney general has his agenda,” Gaither said. “I’m an experienced prosecutor and I filed what I believe are the appropriate charges.” James Clidence, who taught math at Agape from 2012 to 2015, said he left after witnessing abuses so concerning that his wife contacted federal, state and local authorities. None would investigate, he said. “I’m for religious liberty. I’m a pastor. But at this point we’re talking about children's well-being,” Clidence, who now leads a Baptist church in Maryland, said. Harper is among those who question whether religious boarding schools will get real scrutiny in Missouri. “How many things have to happen before they act?” he asked.",U.S./Associated Press,Missouri regulates boarding schools after abuse allegations,https://news.yahoo.com/missouri-regulates-boarding-schools-abuse-134723604.html
