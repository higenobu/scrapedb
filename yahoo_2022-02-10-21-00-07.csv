2/10/2022,"Former “Stop the Steal” supporter, Keith Scott, appeared with CNN’s Elle Reeve on Erin Burnett OutFront Wednesday, where he spoke about how he became deeply devoted to the movement that spread lies about the 2020 presidential election, culminating in the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol. Scott, who was there that day but did not take part in the attack, said, “January 6, 2021 was the greatest day of my life. I felt like a patriot that was standing beside our founding fathers, speaking up against King George. I felt like Braveheart.” But the violence that ensued that day caused Scott to reflect. “After January the 6th,” Scott said, “I came here and I kept mumbling, ‘I feel like I just got out of a cult.’” Scott had spent months living out of his car attending as many rallies as he could, despite never having even been to a Trump rally leading up to the election. “If something was posted saying that there was a rally, like, I was not in control. I was going no matter what,” Scott said. “How did I get caught up in this? I’d never been to a Trump rally. Ya know, I wasn’t one of those people.” I realized I had become addicted to politics.
Keith Scott Scott also pointed out that he came to notice that those promising evidence of election fraud never produced any evidence whatsoever. “The people that were giving evidence of election fraud, it was the same message that we had heard a day before, or weeks before,” Scott said. “But it was like, ‘It’s coming. It's gonna be revealed.’ Like just keeping us — keeping us holding on for the next breath.” But Scott doesn’t blame those promising evidence without ever producing it or the “Stop the Steal” organizers for the violence at the Capitol. “They created a grassroots movement that was ‘Stop the Steal’,” Scott said. “I realized I had been addicted to politics. I had created this reverence for the leaders of ‘Stop the Steal.’ I felt like I was, which is more than ironic looking back, helping prevent a second civil war.” Despite calling the movement a cult, Scott still adheres to some of its beliefs, like blaming “both sides” for the violence at the Capitol. He also believes former President Trump’s lie about President Biden doing better with Black voters than Obama did in 2008. Obama did roughly three percentage points better than Biden. Though he doesn’t feel as welcome as he once did, Scott still sometimes attends rallies, but now carries with him a flag promoting his website electionfraudcult.com. He’s also writing a book chronicling his experiences, hoping to help others who find themselves in the same situation in which he had found himself.

2/10/2022,"A traveling nurse working in New Jersey killed himself hours after he allegedly set a co-worker on fire using an “ignitable device” at a Hackensack hospital earlier this week, officials said. Nicholas Pagano, 31, was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on Tuesday in Waterford Township, New Jersey, according to the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office. At the time of his death, Pagano was a wanted fugitive facing charges for attempted murder, aggravated arson, aggravated assault and unlawful weapons possession charges related to the vicious attack on a hospital staff member. On Feb. 7, shortly after 5:00 a.m. police responded to Hackensack University Medical Center after reports of an assault in the hospital’s breakroom. Upon arrival, hospital staff told authorities Pagano had clubbed a 54-year-old hospital employee with a wrench and then severely burned her. Police say Pagano allegedly set the woman ablaze using an “incendiary device,” according to a criminal complaint obtained by Oxygen.com. Pagano's alleged victim was found by a third party, police say. “When the witness approached the victim, she was observed to have severe burns to her body consistent with having been burned with some kind of unknown ignitable device,” charging documents stated. “There was also charring located in the breakroom in the area where the victim was believed to have been sitting.” Witnesses told police they’d seen Pagano on the second floor in the emergency wing’s hallway shortly before the suspected attack. They later heard the victim screaming and trying to escape Pagano. “The witness then observed Pagano chasing her and striking her with what appeared to be a wrench,” the complaint added. Police seized the wrench they suspected was used in the violent attack. Surveillance footage showed Pagano fleeing the hospital in a 1998 white Jeep Grand Cherokee at approximately 5:29 a.m. Police officials, who subsequently issued a statement announcing a warrant for his arrest, warned that the registered nurse was possibly armed and dangerous.  Nicholas Pagano's Jeep  Photo: West Deptford Police Department  The victim sustained severe, third-degree burns on her upper body, chest and hands, as well as a cut to her head that required stitches, prosecutors said. She was treated on-site in the hospital’s emergency room and was later taken to a separate medical facility in Livingston for further treatment. Her condition was described as critical.  “Our thoughts and prayers are with her and her family,” a spokesperson for the Hackensack Meridian Health told Oxygen.com in a statement.  “Our doctors, nurses and teams are true heroes and deserve our respect. The safety of our patients and our team members is Hackensack Meridian Health’s highest priority.” A specific motive wasn’t immediately released by law enforcement. According to charging documents, Pagano wasn’t scheduled to work on the day of the alleged attack. No other information related to the case was immediately released by officials. Pagano, a contract registered nurse, was first licensed in 2016. He’d been assigned to Hackensack University Medical Center in mid-November. A hospital spokesperson clarified the 31-year-old wasn’t a full-time employee, but he’d been cleared to work at the medical center after passing a state and county background check, a drug screening and a review of his nursing license. Elizabeth Rebein, an assistant prosecutor and public information officer for the Bergen County Prosecutor’s Office, declined to comment further on the case when contacted by Oxygen.com on Wednesday.",U.S./Oxygen,‘Armed And Dangerous’ New Jersey Nurse Who Set Co-Worker On Fire Dead By Suicide,https://news.yahoo.com/armed-dangerous-jersey-nurse-set-204756577.html
2/10/2022,"While President Trump was in office, staff in the White House residence periodically discovered wads of printed paper clogging a toilet — and believed the president had flushed pieces of paper, Maggie Haberman scoops in her forthcoming book, ""Confidence Man."" Why it matters: The revelation by Haberman, whose coverage as a New York Times White House correspondent was followed obsessively by Trump, adds a vivid new dimension to his lapses in preserving government documents. Axios was provided an exclusive first look at some of her reporting. Stay on top of the latest market trends and economic insights with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free Haberman reports Trump has told people that since leaving office, he has remained in contact with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un — whose ""love letters,"" as Trump once called them, were among documents the National Archives retrieved from Mar-a-Lago. Zoom out: The news of White House toilet-flushing comes as the National Archives has reportedly asked the Biden Justice Department to examine Trump's handling of White House records, amid the congressional investigation into the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol. The Washington Post reports that National Archives officials ""suspected Trump had possibly violated laws concerning the handling of government documents."" The National Archives later retrieved 15 boxes from Mar-a-Lago, The Post reported. Archives officials found possible classified material in the returned boxes, The New York Times learned. While in office, the former president blithely flouted the Presidential Records Act, which required him to preserve written communications concerning his official duties. Trump routinely tore up documents and after leaving office brought substantial written materials back to Mar-a-Lago. A Trump spokesman didn't respond to a request for comment about the plumbing matter. Zoom in: Haberman’s ""Confidence Man"" — subtitled ""The Making of Donald Trump and the Breaking of America"" — will be published Oct. 4 by Penguin Press. The publisher says it traces Trump's early life in New York and ""his decades of interactions with prosecutors"" — then follows him through four years in the White House, and on to his post-presidential life in Palm Beach. The intrigue: This is the book Trump fears most. Among Trump aides, Haberman's book has been the most discussed of the bookshelf of books from reporters who covered Trump's campaigns and White House. Several advisers were unhappy about his decision to talk to her as part of his marathon conversations with book authors at Mar-a-Lago. But they concluded he couldn’t help himself and couldn't be stopped. Haberman, a lifelong New Yorker, has covered Trump extensively since 2011, when she was a Politico reporter. Earlier, she got to know his Manhattan milieu as a reporter for the New York Post and Daily News. Haberman, who is represented by Matt Latimer and Keith Urbahn at Javelin, was part of a Times team that won a Pulitzer in 2018. Preorder.
