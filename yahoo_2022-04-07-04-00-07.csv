4/7/2022,"GK Hart/Vikki Hart / George Pachantouris / Getty A little boy wandering away from his Houston home Saturday sparked plenty of worry and a hurried search, but luckily Jose Muñoz had his best friend with him. Jose and his mother, Jasmine Martinez, laid down that afternoon for a nap. When she woke up a short time later, Jose—who is 5 years old—was gone, Houston's KPRC reported. She searched the house to no avail. So, assuming Jose must have pushed open the door and wandered away, she contacted the Houston Police Department. Thankfully, Jose was located a short time later, about one-half mile from his home after witnesses spotted him walking along some train tracks in the area. And when HPD located the youngster, the family's 1-year-old German shepherd, Alejandero, was walking dutifully by his side. Alejandro has had a strong bond with them ever since he joined the family, Jose's sister, Samantha Muñoz, told KPRC. ""We got [the dog] when he was a baby. I was not surprised when they said he was walking with him the whole entire time."" RELATED: German Shepherd Who Lost Puppies Sweetly Dotes on Newborn Kittens This isn't the first time dogs have protected lost children and it's almost certain to not be the last, given the capricious nature of young kiddos and the fact that dogs are probably the best thing in the world. In Jose's case, German shepherds are members of the herding group, so when Alejandro saw a member of ""his"" herd wandering away, the instinct to follow along and stick with Jose kicked in. ""The dog knew he had to go with him because he was doing something he was not supposed to do,"" HPD Sgt. Ricardo Salas told KPRC. Even after HPD arrived and gave the boy water and a cool place to sit, Alejandro was right there, Velcroed to the boy's side. ""I sat the child in my patrol unit so he could get some AC, and I looked back and the dog jumped in the patrol car,"" Salas said. Now, thanks to the quick action of HPD and a very loyal doggo, Jose is back home, safe and sound. HPD says no one will face any charges, and Jose's mother told KPRC she's looking into installing child protective locks on her doors.",U.S./Daily Paws,Family's German Shepherd Sticks with 5-Year-Old Boy Who Escaped Home Until Rescuers Arrive,https://news.yahoo.com/familys-german-shepherd-sticks-5-181730247.html
4/7/2022,"SpinLaunch aims to change how we get to orbit by shooting payloads skywards from the surface at 5,000 MPH, and now it has a shiny new NASA contract to show off its capability later this year. We've been hearing about SpinLaunch for years, but until fairly recently its idea for accelerating mass to orbit by means of a sort of underground centrifuge was, shall we say, only lightly substantiated. It works by using a rotating arm in a large vacuum chamber, spinning faster and faster until the vehicle it's holding is finally let out of an exit tube. In some ways a simple idea (essentially a giant sling), it is of course not so simple to engineer. But a low-altitude test launch late last year showed that they could at least fire a payload at 1,000 MPH and recover it. The system is a work in progress but the prospect of reducing the fuel and mass of even suborbital payloads by more than half is clearly enticing to NASA, which signed a Space Act agreement with SpinLaunch to test it out. Illustration showing the size of the planned accelerator. A test deployment is scheduled for later this year, when SpinLaunch will send a NASA payload up at supersonic speeds and recover it shortly thereafter. The two organizations will then examine the performance of the mission and evaluate its usefulness for future launches, as well as publishing any non-confidential results online. I've asked SpinLaunch for further details on the project and will update this post when I hear back.",Science/TechCrunch,SpinLaunch scores NASA test mission to demonstrate its unique launch method,https://news.yahoo.com/spinlaunch-scores-nasa-test-mission-175001955.html
