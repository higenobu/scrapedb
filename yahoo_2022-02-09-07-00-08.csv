2/9/2022,"The Missouri Supreme Court on Tuesday placed a St. Louis couple who gained national attention for waving guns at racial injustice protesters on probation as attorneys. The court suspended Mark and Patricia McCloskeys' law licenses but delayed the suspension and put the two on probation for a year. The order means the couple can still practice, but the suspension will take effect if they violate their probation by breaking any more laws. Mark McCloskey said Tuesday that he was disappointed by the ruling but happy the court chose to put the couple on probation, rather than suspend their licenses. He and his wife will comply with the order, McCloskey said, but he plans to consult with his attorney about the possibility of taking the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. McCloskey, who is among several Republican candidates running for the U.S. Senate, told The Associated Press he never expected the couple to be accused of moral turpitude before the state Supreme Court “for doing what we thought was right.” “I think the reason why we were asked to be suspended had more to do with politics than anything else,"" McCloskey said. “But we respect the Supreme Court's opinion, although we disagree ... We will comply 100% with the orders."" In a previous court filing seeking the suspension, Missouri Chief Disciplinary Counsel Alan Pratzel cited the McCloskey’s guilty pleas to misdemeanors stemming from the June 2020 encounter with protesters. Pratzel’s office is responsible for investigating ethical complaints against Missouri lawyers. The McCloskeys have said they felt threatened by the protesters who walked onto their private street during global protests that followed the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Mark McCloskey emerged from his home with an AR-15-style rifle, and Patricia McCloskey waved a semi-automatic pistol. The pair received national attention after the confrontation, including from former President Donald Trump and other Republican conservative leaders. Missouri Gov. Mike Parsons pardoned them last year. Noting that support, McCloskey said he doesn't expect the probation to affect his Senate campaign. “The folks that support me know what I did, why I did it and support me for having done it,” he said. Mark McCloskey pleaded guilty to misdemeanor  fourth-degree assault and was ordered to pay a $750 fine. Patricia McCloskey pleaded guilty to misdemeanor harassment and was ordered to pay a $2,000 fine. Pratzel’s motion said that while a pardon erases a person’s conviction, “the person’s guilt remains.” The judges agreed, writing that the couple “committed a misdemeanor offense involving moral turpitude” and should be disciplined. ——— Summer Ballentine in Jefferson City contributed to this report",U.S./Associated Press,Gun-waving St. Louis couple placed on probation as lawyers,https://news.yahoo.com/gun-waving-st-louis-couple-201733517.html
2/9/2022,"A Las Vegas bartender was robbed at gunpoint and then forced to repay his company for the stolen money, according to a lawsuit filed by the employee. Edward Parker was working at The Lodge Hualapai in the early morning hours of Dec. 4 of 2020 when a gunman entered, ordered him ""to kneel on the ground and put his hands behind his head while the armed assailant took all the money that was at the bar,"" according to a Clark County civil complaint filed last week. ""Edward was terrified during the ordeal and feared for his life"" as the gunman got away with $3,937.35, the lawsuit said. His bosses then presented Parker a ""repayment form"" and, worried he'd be fired, the bartender signed it, the lawsuit claimed. Five people were arrested after U.S. Representative Mary Gay Scanlon was carjacked at gunpoint in Philadelphia on Wednesday. Reports say she was walking back to her car when she was approached by two armed men who demanded that she hand over her keys and other belongings. The Democrat, who represents Pennsylvania's 5th Congressional District, was unharmed. His paycheck was allegedly docked $300 at a time before the near-$4,000 debt was paid off by the end of June last year. Despite being forced into the repayment plan and suffering ""panic attacks"" and ""major anxiety,"" Parker kept working, the lawsuit said. In July he was demoted to ""extra board"" status — meaning he'd only be used for on-call work — and has never been asked to work there again, according to the lawsuit. Two people were eventually arrested in connection to the robbery and ""there is no evidence whatsoever that Edward knew these individuals or had anything to do with their actions"" on Dec. 4, 2020, the suit said. A Las Vegas police spokesman could not immediately confirm that an arrest was made in that robbery. A lawyer and other representatives for Lodge Hualapai could not be immediately reached for comment on Tuesday.",U.S./NBC News,"Las Vegas bartender robbed at gunpoint was forced to repay bosses for stolen money, lawsuit says",https://news.yahoo.com/las-vegas-bartender-robbed-gunpoint-202226211.html
2/9/2022,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) said podcast star Joe Rogan “shouldn’t have apologized” for repeatedly using a racist slur, comparing a Black neighborhood to “Planet of the Apes” and spreading coronavirus misinformation on his show “The Joe Rogan Experience.” DeSantis, weighing in on the controversy in an interview with Fox News on Monday, pointed a finger at “the left,” claiming those with opposing political opinions want to bring Rogan down because of his ability to “reach so many people.” “I think the left fear the fact that he can reach so many people, and so they’re out to destroy him,” said DeSantis, who has risen to GOP prominence with his rejection of pandemic public safety measures. “But what I would say is don’t give an inch. Do not apologize. Do not kowtow to the mob. Stand up and tell them to pound sand. If you do that, there’s really nothing that they’re able to do to you. The only way they have power is if you let them get your goat.” DeSantis’ defense of Rogan came the same day that former President Donald Trump offered the podcaster similar advice amid a growing outcry against streaming platform Spotify. Music icons Neil Young and Joni Mitchell, among other artists, pulled their music catalogs off Spotify rather than continue to share the platform with Rogan. “Joe, just go about what you do so well and don’t let them make you look weak and frightened,” Trump said in a statement. DeSantis said he doesn’t listen to Rogan’s show, but believes the podcast’s promotion of anti-vaccine guests is “just bringing opposing views. He’s letting people decide.” Science and medical experts have argued that Rogan’s podcast promotes false information with one-sided takes that jeopardize public health and damage public trust in science and medical professionals. Rogan issued an apology on Instagram Saturday for his racist language, calling it “regretful” and “shameful,” but claimed he never used the N-word in a racist way. “I never used it to be racist because I’m not racist, but whenever you’re in a situation where you have to say, ‘I’m not racist,’ you fucked up and I clearly have fucked up,” he said. He also addressed his comparison of a Black neighborhood with the movie “Planet of the Apes” when he said he went to see the film and there were no other white people in the audience. “We walked into ‘Planet of the Apes.’ We walked into Africa, dude. We walked in the door and there were no white people. There was no white people. ‘Planet of the Apes’ didn’t take place in Africa. That was a racist thing for me to say,” Rogan said on his program in 2013. Rogan denied he meant to compare Black people with apes. “I did not nor would I ever say that Black people are apes, but it sure fucking sounded like that,” he said Saturday. “I immediately afterwards said that’s a racist thing to say, ‘Planet of the Apes’ wasn’t even in Africa, I was just saying there was a lot of Black people there.” This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

Catherine McKinney, along with her boyfriend Dakota Hill, were jailed on Sunday, Feb. 6, according to the Thomas County Sheriff’s Office. Jail records show they were arrested on warrants. The Shelby County Sheriff’s Office in Kentucky said they face custodial interference charges and will be transferred to Kentucky. A missing persons poster shared last week by Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron says Serenity’s parents were refusing to cooperate with officers. Concerned family members have not seen Serenity since Dec. 24, 2020, according to the poster. Cameron said they are concerned she is in danger. Serenity has blonde hair, blue eyes and a possible birth mark on her stomach. It’s unknown where her last location is, but the attorney general’s office said she was possibly in Shelby, Bullitt or Jefferson counties, the latter of which includes Louisville.

2/9/2022,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara is accused of punching and badly injuring a man in an attack also involving at least three men who were with Kamara last weekend at a Las Vegas Strip nightclub, according to a police arrest report made public Tuesday. The alleged victim told Las Vegas police he fell unconscious on the floor, where police said video showed him being punched, kicked and stomped on by three people who accompanied Kamara at the rooftop nightclub Drai’s at the Cromwell hotel-casino. “At no point during this attack did (the man) hit, punch or push Kamara or any of his associates,” the police report said. The identities of the three other alleged attackers were blacked out in the police report. No other arrests have been made. Officer Larry Hadfield, a Las Vegas police spokesman, called the investigation ongoing. Police said the attack happened about 6:30 a.m. Saturday outside an elevator at Drai's, and the alleged victim first spoke with police at a hospital about 5:30 p.m. Police attributed the delay to the man receiving medical treatment. Kamara played in the NFL Pro Bowl at noon local time Sunday before police interviewed him at Allegiant Stadium after the game. He was arrested about 3:30 p.m. on suspicion of felony battery resulting in substantial bodily harm. Kamara posted bond for his release from the Clark County jail. He has a March 8 court date. Records did not immediately say if Kamara had an attorney. A conviction on the felony charge could result in a sentence of one to five years in state prison. Representatives for the NFL and the Saints team declined Tuesday to comment about the police report. “The matter is being reviewed under the personal conduct policy,” league spokesman Brian McCarthy said. Kamara punched the man approximately eight times, according to the police report, while the three men with Kamara stomped on the man’s face, chest and legs a total of more than 20 times. Police said the incident began when Kamara put his hand on the man’s chest to stop him from entering the elevator, the man pushed the football player’s hand away, a person with Kamara punched the man, and Kamara “immediately attacked."" When police asked Kamara why he punched the man, “Kamara indicated he thought (the man) was running away and had done something to his group so he chased and punched (him) several times,” a police detective said in the report. Kamara told police he remembered the man calling one of his friends ugly and later threatening to “whoop” someone. Kamara is one of the top running backs in the NFL. He had more than 1,300 yards from scrimmage and nine touchdowns on the way to being selected for his fifth Pro Bowl in five seasons.",U.S./Associated Press,"Police: Saints' Kamara, 3 others attacked man at Vegas club",https://news.yahoo.com/police-saints-kamara-3-others-201920071.html

2/9/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Army general tapped to take over as top U.S. commander in the Middle East warned senators Tuesday that if Russian invades Ukraine, as many fear, it could create broader instability in the Middle East, including Syria. But he was clear that Iran remains the key threat to U.S. and allies in the region. Lt. Gen. Erik Kurilla also told the Senate Armed Services Committee that China is expanding its power and spending in the Central Command region, including in countries needed by the U.S. to gather intelligence on extremist activities in Afghanistan. “The United States faces a new era of strategic competition with China and Russia that is not confined to one geographical region and extends into the (Central Command) area of responsibility,” said Kurilla during the committee's hearing on his nomination. “As the United States rightfully prioritizes competition with China, we must remain engaged in the Middle East and Central and South Asia.” Kurilla, a combat-hardened officer with extensive experience in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, got a friendly reception from the panel and was told he would probably be confirmed. If he gets the job, Kurilla would take over as the Pentagon continues to try to shift its focus to the Indo-Pacific and counter a rising China, and to bolster defenses against Russia in Europe. But Iran and Tehran-backed proxies have kept up a steady drumbeat of attacks on U.S. and allied forces across the Middle East, often hindering plans to shift more troops out of the region. Kurilla would replace Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, who is retiring after three years leading the command. McKenzie has overseen a tumultuous time in the region, with America’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, the dismantling of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, and escalating threats from Iran and its proxies as they launch more attacks against Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and ships at sea. Kurilla, who is currently the commander of the 18th Airborne Corps, told the committee that after the hearing he was deploying to Germany as part of the U.S. effort to reassure allies concerned about Russia's military build-up along Ukraine's borders. Asked about the potential for repercussions in the Middle East of a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine, Kurilla said he believes that it could spill over into Syria, where Russia already has a military base and troops. “If Russia does invade Ukraine they would not hesitate to be able to act as a spoiler in Syria as well,” said Kurilla, who previously served as a deputy at Central Command. He added that the U.S. doesn't believe Russia wants to go to war with the United States. On China, Kurilla said 18 of the 21 countries in the Central Command region have signed strategic agreements with Beijing, which has increased its development in the Middle East. The U.S., he said, has to be able to counter China there. Senators quizzed Kurilla on efforts to monitor al-Qaida and Islamic State extremists in Afghanistan, now that there are no longer U.S. forces in the country. He said efforts continue to work with surrounding nations to set up “over-the-horizon” capabilities. The U.S., which left Afghanistan at the end of August, has been struggling to negotiate with a number of countries in the region to allow overflights, basing or other intelligence gathering from within their borders. Military leaders say it is difficult to monitor extremist groups from afar because doing so requires long drone flights that allow limited surveillance time. Asked about working with the Taliban, Kurilla said the U.S. should take a pragmatic approach. He said the Taliban also views the Islamic State group as an enemy, so that may be a potential area of agreement. He also said the U.S. must find ways to deal with the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, and that may involve Taliban help with food deliveries. Kurilla graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1988, and has served multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, commanding conventional and special operations forces. He commanded a Stryker battalion in Iraq in 2004, and was shot and wounded.",World/Associated Press,US general says Russia turmoil could spill to Middle East,https://news.yahoo.com/us-general-says-russia-turmoil-203206082.html
