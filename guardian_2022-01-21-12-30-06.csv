1/21/2022,"Former Afghan interpreters and other colleagues left behind by the Australian government after the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan now face a high risk of brutal reprisals, a Senate inquiry has found. A damning new consensus report said Australia had asked Afghan nationals to “stand in harm’s way with Australian personnel” but had “left them standing in harm’s way”.  “It is dishonourable,” said the inquiry’s interim report, which was written by the Labor chair, Kimberley Kitching, and not opposed by government members of the committee. Australia’s last-ditch evacuation mission – launched on 18 August days after Kabul fell to the Taliban – lifted 4,168 people out of the Afghan capital over the course of nine days. Those carried on the 32 Australian flights included 167 Australian citizens and 2,984 Afghans with approved visas. The report described this evacuation effort by Australian defence force personnel and other Australian officials as “immense and heroic” – expressing gratitude to those who had worked in dangerous and high-pressure conditions. But the committee said it had also heard “distressing evidence about those who attempted to access the evacuation mission but were unsuccessful”. It said there were process-related delays in the lead-up to the evacuation and “a large number of individuals and their families remain in Afghanistan at high risk of brutal reprisals from the Taliban because of their association with Australia”. The report, published on Friday, said “loyalty to mates” was essential to the Australian ethos, and Australian policymakers “need to keep true to that ideal, lived every day by the heroes who risk everything to defend us”. “There is an enduring duty of loyalty owed by Australia to the interpreters and other Afghans who risked their lives in the service of the Australian defence forces when they were in Afghanistan,” the report of the Senate’s foreign affairs, defence and trade references committee said. “That loyalty was shown by the brave Australian men and women who served in Afghanistan. It must be shown by the government that sent them there.” The report said there had been about 425 Afghan locally engaged employees (LEE) with viasa, or applications in process, in Afghanistan at the time of the evacuation operation in August. While it was not known how many of these individuals managed to secure places in the Australian evacuation, the report said “a significant number of individuals” who had helped Australia were ultimately unable to secure a visa during the operation. “Tragically, there have now been reports that some LEE applicants have been injured or killed by the Taliban, with others currently in hiding due to their association with Australia.” The Senate committee said it saw evidence that, in July 2021, Defence “was still issuing rejection letters to LEE applicants due to technicalities (such as applicants not having applied within six months’ of ceasing employment) despite the dire security situation”. The committee also cited evidence, as of 21 August, that some LEE applications were rejected by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade “due to its approach to the eligibility criteria relating to the private contractors”. The report said there was no “recourse for these at-risk individuals other than joining the general humanitarian visa application process”. It said it was not until 22 August, five days into the Australian evacuation operation at Hamid Karzai international airport, that the government decided to consider emergency subclass 449 visas for those who had applied for the LEE program but were not certified. Those delays meant that “many who were issued 449 visas were ultimately unable to access the Australian evacuation effort”. “These issues resulted in the inevitable situation that a large number of individuals and their families remain in Afghanistan, at high risk of brutal reprisals from the Taliban because of their association with Australia.” The report was also critical of how the government handled the extension of these emergency visas for people associated with the LEE program who were still in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan after the evacuation mission ended. It says the Morrison government only announced extensions to those visas on 18 November “the day before these visas were due to start expiring”. The committee heard Defence was still processing 70 LEE certification applications as of late October. The committee urged the government to complete these as quickly as possible, and in a favourable light, given the “likely impossibility” that such people would be able to remain safely in Afghanistan. “There is no excuse for bureaucratic delays when lives are literally at stake.” The report said Australia’s obligations extended “beyond the moral imperative” to include “the vital national security interest of Australia” – because Australia needed to maintain a reputation for caring for those willing to help its personnel in future military engagements. The report made eight recommendations, including that the government commission “a full and thorough review” of the Afghan employee visa program to “ensure that programs of this nature are improved”. The government should also review how the Afghanistan evacuation was handled. The references committee adopted the report by consensus. The membership includes Labor senators Tim Ayres and Tony Sheldon, Liberal senators Eric Abetz and David Van, and independent senator Jacqui Lambie. While there were no dissenting reports, the Greens added additional comments calling for Australia to expand its humanitarian intake. The main report urged the government to “review its policies for pathways to permanent protection visas for Afghan asylum seekers and refugees currently in Australia, and prioritise family reunification when processing humanitarian visa claims from Afghan nationals”. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has previously insisted no one who arrived in Australia by boat would gain permanent resettlement. The committee urged the government to publish a breakdown of the total cost of Australia’s engagement in Afghanistan across each year of its engagement, as well as a breakdown of costs across departments, including costs of support provided to veterans who served in the country. A final report is due in February.",News/World news,‘Dishonourable’: report says Afghans left behind ‘at high risk of brutal reprisals’ due to links with Australia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/21/dishonourable-report-says-afghans-left-behind-at-high-risk-of-brutal-reprisals-due-to-links-with-australia
1/21/2022,"Shortly before the 1996 election, Paul Keating warned the country that “when the government changes, the country changes”. With both major parties entering this year with a commitment to reaching net zero emissions by 2050, none of us should be fooled that this means there is barely a crack of daylight between them when it comes to tackling the climate crisis. That is because the climate policies of each of the two parties put us on track for a vastly different country as soon as the end of this decade. And while there is a tendency to only focus on international targets and timelines when it comes to the fight against climate change, the reality is that these fundamentally affect what kind of economy, society, and environment we want to live in.  There are five clear areas where the divergence between the two major parties is most stark and will shape what life in Australia will look like by 2030. First, when it comes to the cost of electricity that will power our households and businesses. Australia might lead the world when it comes to individual rooftop solar power systems, but we lag behind when it comes to the penetration of renewables into our electricity grid. Only a quarter or so of our grid is currently fuelled by renewables, with close to two-thirds of our electricity still coming from coal. Tipping this balance isn’t just a quixotic ideal, it’s essential if we want lower electricity prices and enhanced productivity. It affects everyday life. If we get the balance right, the average electricity bill could be more than 25 % cheaper by the end of this decade. For most Australians, the choice should therefore be seen less as about renewables versus coal, and more about the cost of electricity. But tipping the balance also takes time. In the last 15 years, renewables have increased around 20 % — largely as a result of a mandatory renewable energy target. Thankfully, both sides of politics now believe we can increase the share of renewables by almost a further 50 % by the end of this decade if we start now. The difference is the government would do so by relying on the policies of the states and territories to get there, whereas Labor would seek to go further through rewiring the electricity grid, and installing community batteries plus local solar banks. Even more stark is the question of what kind of cars we will be driving by 2030. Electric vehicles currently account for just 2% of new car sales in Australia. By 2030, Labor wants this to be close to 90%. That would take Australia from effectively last place on the podium of comparable nations to somewhere near the top. By contrast, the government hopes electric vehicles will account for just under a third of new car sales by the end of this decade despite the fact some European countries have already reached more than double that. The difference is between becoming the developed world’s dumping ground of immovable combustible engine vehicles, or benefiting from what will by then likely be the cheaper electric alternatives. This brings us to the third point of divergence between the two parties. The path we choose at home will also play a part in determining how we are seen on the international stage. Whatever your view of the Cop26 outcome last November, one thing is clear: Australia emerged as a diminished global power that seemed hell bent on continuing to bury its head in the sand when it comes to climate change. We showed up with simply a pamphlet as opposed to policies. We allowed our national pavilion to be sponsored by the oil and gas industry. We blocked critical parts of the negotiating text. And then we trashed the outcome before the ink was even dry by flat out refusing to take another look at our lacklustre 2030 emissions reduction target over the next year. This did real damage to brand Australia. Reclaiming the mantle of international climate credibility requires us to not just show up, but to sign up to the climate fight. Actions speak louder than words when it comes to how the international community engages with this issue. And with climate change becoming a critical foreign policy and national security priority for governments, it also means we face the real risk of the imposition of carbon tariffs by the end of this decade if we do not. That would only mean a higher cost of living for most Australians. But by far the biggest and most important difference between the two parties’ climate policies goes to what kind of economy we want at the end of this decade. And what kind of jobs that follow – especially in our regions. The government’s insistence over the summer that somehow Cop26 did not ring the death knell for coal has been like watching the Black Knight in Monty Python insist he just has a flesh wound. To be clear: for the first time, almost the entire world was prepared to sign up to a commitment to phase out coal, including Australia’s own negotiating team. China and India may have only been willing to go so far as committing to a phase down, but both countries’ net zero plans will require them to wean themselves off coal in the next two decades. That includes Australian coal. The hard truth is that coal may be Australia’s second largest export but it clearly won’t last forever. The government’s own “modelling” admits coal will at least halve in price by the middle of the century. So we either begin the hard work to find a replacement for our trade balance sheet or we do not. That’s not about killing an industry overnight, it’s about not cutting off our nose to spite our face. If the government was serious about climate action and serious about protecting our coal workers, the regions and our national economy, they’d have a plan to begin to transition this workforce rather than continuing to provide its workers false hope. Thankfully, we are blessed with a perfect storm when it comes to the alternative: the best climate for renewable technologies to thrive, a thirsty Asian market for green energy exports such as hydrogen, and a workforce that will need a just transition away from coal precisely where many of these massive renewable energy powerhouse projects would need to be constructed. As the Business Council of Australia and the ACTU have said, up to 395,000 new clean energy export jobs could be created in the coming decades if we choose wisely. Instead, the government is clearly banking in the short term on the fact that for many Australians seeing a future without coal is hard. And it’s true: fossil fuels still have a deep place in the Australian economic psyche long after the mining boom. As the Climate of the Nation report demonstrates, most Australians think the coal industry accounts for close to 10% of the workforce when in fact it only makes up 0.4% with fewer than 10,000 workers nationwide. More Australians work at McDonald’s. While it is true that Australia’s contribution to global emissions cuts will not in and of itself bend the curve of individual climate impacts, if every country did what Australia was doing, the Great Barrier Reef would disappear. Either way, by 2030 these climate impacts will become more frequent and intense as a result of our collective inaction, and even worse if we squander the rest of this decade. While this is the hardest to measure, it is yet another cautionary tale for the path we choose to follow. With both sides of politics now committed to net zero emissions, voters will hopefully reward those that can actually spell out how we can get there and how we can transition our workers and our economy in the process and deliver a lower cost of living. Not those that want to have their cake and eat it too. And this might mean that if anyone is now wedged politically on climate, it is the government. Voters should choose carefully. What kind of Australia we want to live in, and what kind of Australia we want our children and grandchildren to inherit is firmly on the ballot.

1/21/2022,"And so Sundance 2022 begins with the curtain drawn back by Jesse Eisenberg, an actor who’s long been linked with the festival, with films such as The Squid and the Whale, Adventureland, Holy Rollers, The End of the Tour and last year’s Wild Indian all premiering. His on-screen persona – jittery, insecure, fast-talking, intelligent – made him an ideal poster boy not just for Sundance but the independent scene at large, a writer’s schtick made so believable on screen that it felt inevitable he would soon head behind it. He went from writing short stories to writing plays and now he’s writing and directing his first film, the so-so festival opener When You Finish Saving the World, based on his audio drama from 2020. Eisenberg doesn’t star but he’s cast Stranger Things’ Finn Wolfhard to fill the role, the actor doing a successful cover version without leaning into cheap impersonation. He’s Ziggy, a high schooler who devotes his time to his music which he livestreams to an audience of over 20,000 people worldwide, a number he’s endlessly proud of. His mother Evelyn (Julianne Moore) is less impressed, her time focused on the more noble act of running a shelter for victims of domestic abuse.  As the two grow ever distant from each other, they both try to find ways to replace a love that’s grown sour. Ziggy ingratiates himself with the more politically minded chapter at school, motivated by a crush on classmate Lila (13 Reasons Why star Alisha Boe) while Evelyn tries to redirect her maternal instinct to Kyle (Billy Bryk), a teen who’s moved into the shelter with his mother. What drives them both toward these new pursuits is not just a need to replace some warmth that’s cooled at home but to feel like they’re doing something good and through that process that they might then become good people. Eisenberg isn’t trying to insist this is The Film We Need Right Now (thank heavens) and his characters don’t directly address the specifics of the time we’re living in (it’s a Covid-shot movie that mercifully doesn’t exist in a Covid-afflicted world) but after two years of us all descending further into an uncontrollable form of global hell, it’s hard not to see an added resonance to his characters’ quest. Who hasn’t tried just that bit harder of late to feel like they’re helping, whether it’s on a micro or a macro level, whether it’s actually achieving anything or not? What Eisenberg’s script quickly realises is that there’s really no such thing as a selfless act, that helping others is most often a way of helping ourselves. Ziggy’s ignorant callousness can perhaps be chalked up to his youthful naiveté (his thrill at singing political songs is equally matched by his thrill at the money it makes him) while Evelyn’s unhealthy obsession with Kyle is mostly driven by a need to feel needed. Eisenberg pokes fun at the cushioned liberalism of the family (a dinner table that allows for a father to lecture his son about the cultural appropriation of blues and a son to tell his father to shut the fuck up without consequence) and the safe midwestern pocket they live in, yet never with the specific, unsparing sharpness that, say, Noah Baumbach would have brought (a writer-director whose shadow looms large over the project). It’s a film of people telling themselves they’re making a difference without really doing much of anything and it’s hard not to feel similarly unmoved by the time it’s all over. The fraught mother-son dynamic feels uneasy and believable (two difficult people struggling to move past the too-comfortable roles they’ve grown out of), and Moore and Wolfhard certainly give it their all, but there’s some added texture missing from who these people really are and in the film’s brief 87-minute runtime it’s left to the heavy lifting of Emile Mosseri’s score to bring any real heft. The ending is particularly, frustratingly rushed, as if we were fooled into thinking this was a novel but it was actually just a short story. As a first-time director, Eisenberg is at least refreshingly restrained and gimmick-avoidant (this does not look like an A24-funded debut movie), but as a writer with some experience, albeit on stage and on the page, it feels a little anemic. A rocky start.

1/21/2022,"The last two weeks of the Omicron outbreak have been the deadliest of the entire coronavirus pandemic, with four of the five highest daily death tolls all in the past week alone, figures reveal. However, despite the rising numbers, experts say we still don’t know enough about who is dying and why.  Here, we’ve pulled together the information we do know about deaths from various government sources. The data shows that for Australia’s third large Covid wave, older Australians continue to be overrepresented in the death toll, even as younger Australians record far more cases. And in New South Wales, where more detailed data is available, the protective effect of vaccines remains clear, with serious outcomes – deaths and ICU admission – far less likely for vaccinated people with Covid, across every age group. There were 1,653 deaths across Australia from the beginning of the pandemic up to 27 November, which is when the first recorded case of Omicron in Australia was announced. Since then, with a mix of the Delta and Omicron variants circulating over this time, there have been over 1,100 deaths: There were 78 deaths reported on Tuesday alone this week. Before the current wave the highest daily death toll was in September 2020, when Victoria recorded 59 deaths. Those aged 70 and over accounted for almost 80% of the deaths in the initial waves up to August last year, and once again make up a similar share of deaths in the current wave: Data from the federal Department of Health shows that the skew in deaths towards older age groups is happening despite younger Australians representing a much larger proportion of infections: The government does not publish the number of booster vaccinations by age group in its daily statistics, so it is unclear what proportion of older people are protected by a third vaccine dose or not. In NSW, which publishes much more detailed information than the federal government or other jurisdictions in its weekly surveillance reports, we can see how the risk of serious outcomes changes with both age and vaccination status. Figures from the report show the number of deaths or ICU hospitalisations – called “severe outcomes” in the report – as a proportion of total Covid cases, split up by age group and vaccination status. So, for example, of 708 unvaccinated Covid cases in the 70-to-79 age group, there were 171 people who either died or ended up in ICU, giving a severe outcome rate of 21.9%, compared with a rate of 1.8% for vaccinated people. These numbers show that older people face a higher rate of serious cases even while vaccinated. However, importantly, they also show vaccinated people of all age groups are less likely to die or require treatment in intensive care: The NSW data defines an unvaccinated person as anyone who has not had a single dose of a Covid vaccine and so includes those who were ineligible. The NSW Health surveillance report also shows that the vast majority of deaths up to 1 January 2022 have occurred in hospitals. Relatively fewer people have died in aged care or at home in NSW. Notes and methods: Covid deaths by jurisdiction and age scraped daily from the federal health department’s Covid statistics page since the beginning of October by Guardian Australia. Data preceding this was scraped by Ken Tsang Daily and weekly Covid death calculations used data from CovidLive.com.au The health department defines a Covid death as a death in a probable or confirmed case where there is no clear alternative cause of death, such as a car accident.

1/21/2022,"Igrew up next to the swooshing, murky tea-coloured Waipā River in Ngāruawāhia. Always risk-averse, childhood myths of Taniwha and the idea of the snapping teeth and slither of monster eels terrified me a bit, so I never swam in rivers. Meanwhile, the promise of an unexpected brush against slimy seaweed and the thrash of the open, vast and unknowable ocean are at once beguiling yet nerve-racking to me. Calmer than the pummel of the sea or the dark magic of rivers, lake swimming appeals. Tucked away in Central Otago is the charming historic township St Bathans, a former goldmining town now with a population of fewer than ten. A prominent feature of the town is the sublime Blue Lake which remains a breathtaking sight no matter how many times you see it. Starting in 1864, miners sluiced through the quartz rock of 120 metre high Kildare Hill.  By 1933 at 168 metres deep, it was the deepest mining pit in the southern hemisphere. But because it was encroaching on the township, mining ceased and the pit filled with water from the surrounding hills. The lake’s stunning hue which veers from dazzling emerald to a soft turquoise is due to the mineral rich water. The surrounding white quartz tailings lend an otherworldly lunar-like appearance. Timeless, placeless and atmospheric, it looks like an alternative utopian film set from an Andrei Tarkovsy film. Quietly spectacular, the Blue Lake is 800 metres long and 50 metres deep. Slipping into it, the silky water makes me think of Cleopatra’s bath and offers respite from the scorching hot dustiness of the summer heat. A place of extremes, the weather in St Bathans can reach searing temperatures in summer, and freezing cold in winter. Gliding through the luminous water, hemmed in by the science fiction-like tailings, I think of the music video for a 1994 David Kilgour song, the heartstopping Beached, shot around the Blue Lake and St Bathans. In over-exposed, rinsed-out honeyed tones with Kilgour plaintively singing, “where do you come from? Where do you come from?” – it looks like it was filmed on another planet. A place steeped in rich heritage, St Bathans is a dreamy spot for heritage heads. The historic hotel built in 1882 is aptly named Vulcan Hotel and is rumoured to be haunted. There’s a 90-minute track that loops right around the water offering sensational views of the lake and township. A shorter option of about 30 minutes offers a glimpse of the old sluicings and the goldmining machinery which converted Kildare Hill into the Blue Lake. With its sensuous sublimity, the Blue Lake offers swimming as a way of dreaming. It feels restorative, a word which absurdly turns my mind to those old folk in the 1985 film Cocoon in which a group of elderly people are rejuvenated by aliens via a swimming pool of water which has been charged with “life force”. In my hazy memory of the film, the colour of the lake is the same hue as the Cocoon pool, are the lake minerals revitalising? As a lifelong North Islander accustomed to subtropical lushness, the South Island with its vast landscapes, singular light quality, and spots like the Blue Lake with its esoteric eerie oddness, forever holds an alluring mystique.

1/21/2022,"For airline staff, navigating the pandemic has meant grappling with a surge in bad behavior, ranging from temper tantrums to punching flight attendants in the face.  In the latest incident, 129 passengers paid a remarkable price: a maskless “disruptive customer” forced American Airlines’ flight AAL38 flying from Miami to London to turn around and go back, the New York Times reported. The reversal occurred off the North Carolina coast, after the flight had traveled about 500 miles. The customer, described by police as a woman in her 40s, was “refusing to comply with the federal mask requirement”, American Airlines said in a statement to the newspaper. “Once the plane made it to the gate, the passenger was escorted off the plane by MDPD officers without incident. The passenger was then dealt with administratively by American Airlines staff,” a police detective said, according to CNN. Though the outcome was dramatic in this case, such unruliness has become commonplace. “This is happening every day now,” Sara Nelson, president of the national flight attendants’ union, told the Guardian in October after a man, asked to wear a mask and stop talking on his phone, flew into a rage, stormed out of his seat and threatened to break someone’s neck. In fact, it’s happening about 16 times a day. That’s according to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records, which lists 5,981 unruly passenger reports last year. A total of 4,290 of those were listed as “mask-related incidents”. This year – mere 20 days old – has already seen 151 incidents, 90 of which were mask related, though the FAA says the figure has dropped by about half since early 2021. Last year’s incidents included a woman, who swore at flight attendants and was asked to leave, reportedly punched another woman holding a baby on her way out; a man who was duct-taped to his seat after allegedly groping a flight attendant; and a man who allegedly left a flight attendant with a concussion after punching her in the nose. Another flight attendant, who wished to remain anonymous, described the situation in stark terms to the Guardian in September: “I go to work now and I always worry what’s going to happen, what’s going to trip somebody up, trigger their anger. It’s a whole new ballgame out there right now and it’s a different type of passenger we’re seeing.” But there have also been moments to offer hope for better behavior: this month, an American woman noticed her throat hurting while flying from Chicago to Iceland. She went to the restroom, took a Covid test and found she was positive – so she stayed in the bathroom for the rest of the flight, she said.",News/Business,"Unruly, maskless passenger forces London-bound flight to return to Miami",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/20/unruly-maskless-passenger-forces-london-bound-flight-to-return-to-miami
1/21/2022,"New South Wales has again recorded its deadliest day of the pandemic, with 46 people succumbing to Covid-19 as the state’s chief health officer warns of more to come. A total of 359 people have now died from the virus in the first 20 days of 2022 in NSW, more than half the total number of deaths recorded throughout 2021.  Premier Dominic Perrottet struck a defiant tone at a press conference on Friday, saying updated modelling showing hospitalisations and people in ICU remain below best-case scenarios released by the state’s health department at the beginning of this month. There were 2,743 Covid-positive people in hospital and 209 in intensive care on Friday, the second day in a row that those figures have fallen. “In difficult times, these are reassuring and pleasing signs in relation to our health system,” Perrottet said. “We were expecting more than 3,000 people in our hospitals with Covid and in a worst-case scenario, 6,000 people … the figure today provides some reassurance in terms of the situation here in NSW.” Along with the updated hospitalisation modelling, the NSW chief health officer, Kerry Chant, on Friday gave a detailed breakdown of the 28 people under the age of 65 who had died from Covid in the past week. Of the 28, 13 were not vaccinated, while one person had received one dose. Only four of the 28 did not have a significant underlying health condition, and three of those people were unvaccinated. The other 24 had a series of health conditions including 10 with significant heart or valvular disease, seven with diabetes, six with obesity, six with chronic lung disease, four with severe liver disease and four with cancer. Many of the conditions were overlapping. Chant also warned the number of people dying from the virus in NSW was “likely to remain high” for some time given the lag in case numbers and hospitalisations. “Unfortunately, the death numbers will be likely to remain high,” she said. But she said a “variety of indicators” pointed to the outbreak having slowed in recent days, with officials becoming increasingly confident the first Omicron wave had plateaued. Drops in hospitalisations, the number of workers in isolation, and case positivity rates pointed to declining transmission, she said. “That all gives us a sense that the spread of Covid is slowing and it is pleasing to see,” she said. Perrottet has continued to come under fire over decisions made since he became premier in October, including scrapping an indoor mask mandate on 15 December before being forced to reintroduce the policy as cases surged in the week leading up to Christmas. But he insists he does not regret that decision, and the decision to push ahead with the loosening of restrictions. On Friday he began to push back on suggestions he had gone further than other states in reopening the economy by pointing to a similar level of restrictions in the Labor-held states of Victoria and Queensland. “We’re not going our own way in NSW, we are following the national plan with every other state along the eastern seaboard,” he said. “This view is false that is being perpetrated that somehow NSW is taking a different approach. NSW is taking the national approach just like Victoria and just like Queensland. “If you look right across the country, we’ve all taken this approach [although] there are different approaches obviously in Western Australia.” It comes as the death of a baby with Covid last month was referred to the coroner, and the Australian federal police launch an investigation into reports of price gouging of rapid antigen tests. Health authorities have confirmed the baby had tested positive for Covid-19 and died in hospital last month. In a statement, the Hunter New England Health District said it had referred the case to the coroner “given uncertainties as to the cause of death”. “The coroner and forensic pathologists are working hard to get the answers that, most importantly, the family wants and the clinicians want, in terms of this child and the contribution that Covid may or may not have made to its death,” Chant said on Friday.",News/Australia news,NSW Covid update: another record day as state reports 46 deaths but hospital numbers down ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/21/nsw-covid-update-another-record-day-as-state-reports-46-deaths-but-hospital-numbers-down
