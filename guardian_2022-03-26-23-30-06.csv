3/26/2022,"A mayor in a Ukrainian town occupied by Russian forces has been released from captivity and the soldiers have agreed to leave after a mass protest by residents. Slavutych, a northern town close to the Chernobyl nuclear site, was taken by Russian forces but stun grenades and overhead fire failed to disperse unarmed protesters on its main square on Saturday. The crowd demanded the release of mayor Yuri Fomichev, who had been taken prisoner by the Russian troops. Attempts by Russian troops to intimidate the growing protest failed and on Saturday afternoon Fomichev was let go by his captors. An agreement was made that the Russians would leave the town if those with arms handed them over to the mayor with a dispensation for those with hunting rifles. Fomichev told those protesting that the Russians had agreed to withdraw “if there are no [Ukrainian] military in the city”. The deal struck, the mayor said, was that the Russians would make a search for Ukrainian soldiers and arms and then depart. One Russian checkpoint outside the city would remain. The incident highlights the struggle that Russian forces have faced even where they have had military victories. Slavutych, population 25,000, sits just outside the so-called exclusion zone around Chernobyl – which in 1986 was the site of the world’s worst nuclear disaster. The plant itself was seized by Russian forces soon after the start of the 24 February invasion. “The Russians opened fire into the air. They threw flash-bang grenades into the crowd. But the residents did not disperse, on the contrary, more of them showed up,” said Oleksandr Pavlyuk, a governor of the Kyiv region in which Slavutych sits. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s defence ministry claimed that Russian was “trying to intensify the activities of sabotage and reconnaissance groups in Kyiv in order to destabilise the socio-political situation, disrupt the system of public and military administration”. Western officials have said that Vladimir Putin had planned to take Ukraine’s capitals within days of announcing his “special military operation” on 24 February but had come across unexpectedly fierce resistance. While the occasional blast can be heard in Kyiv from fighting to the west of the city, the centre has been calm for most of the past fortnight. “To start with they wanted blitzkrieg, 72 hours to get control [of] Kyiv and much of Ukraine, and it all fell apart,” Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the lead negotiator in talks with Russia, in an interview in Kyiv. “They had poor operational planning, and they realised it was advantageous for them to surround cities, cut off the main supply routes, and force people there to have a deficit of food, water and medicines,” he said, describing the siege of Mariupol as a tactic to sow psychological terror and exhaustion. However, Podolyak expressed scepticism over a claim from the Russian defence ministry on Friday that Moscow’s forces would now focus mainly on the Donbas area in east Ukraine. “Of course I don’t believe that. They don’t have interests in Donbas. Their main interests are Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and the south – to take Mariupol, and to close the Azov Sea … we see them regrouping and preparing more troops to send in,” he said.",News/World news,Russian soldiers release Ukraine town’s mayor and agree to leave after protests,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/26/russian-soldiers-release-ukraine-towns-mayor-and-agree-to-leave-after-protests
3/26/2022,"That Sprints’ songs sound so conversational shouldn’t come as a surprise. “The best way to describe the songwriting is like ‘pub chat’,” singer Karla Chubb told DIY magazine. “It’s issues that you normally gather around a table and chat to your friends about on a Friday night over a pint of Guinness.” The resultant arresting lyrics have been a feature of the Dublin four-piece – completed by bassist Sam McCann, guitarist Colm O’Reilly and drummer Jack Callan – since their 2020 debut single The Cheek (“He said: ‘Baby, are you straight?’ / I said: ‘Bi – bye bye’”). A Modern Job, the title track of their new EP, is about not conforming to societal expectations. “My whole life I’ve been chasing things that people told me would make me happy and it just made me incredibly depressed,” says Chubb. “It’s only been in the last couple of years of really embracing who I am that I’ve thought, I just don’t care any more.” There’s a lighter side, too: I’m in a Band is just straight-up funny. Taking their musical nods from the post-punk of Savages (one of whose gigs was a pivotal moment in their origin story) and Fontaines DC, Sprints are in their element on stage and made their SXSW debut this month. In their own words: “We’re such a live band.” Watch out for them at festivals this summer.

3/26/2022,"My earliest memory is my dad buying me a pair of royal-blue high heels. I was seven. Before that I’d shoved tissues in Mum’s instead. I was obsessed with the noise they made when you walked in them. I’m not into fashion – I wear what I like – but I love that powerful sound. Mum must have had a lot of gas and air during my birth, with the number of names she gave me. Katrina Amy Alexandra Alexis Infield? It’s a lot. I hated them so, at 17, I changed it. Katie Price suited me better, thanks very much. I’m a nurturing person by nature. Animals were everything through my childhood. I was happiest riding horses and chopping their carrots. It’s why I’ve had so many kids. I couldn’t believe it when I was on Page 3 for the first time. It was 1996 and Demi Moore had starred in a film called Striptease. For a week I was in the paper taking off an item of clothing every day. I went out and bought every copy I could find. I was attacked at gunpoint in South Africa in 2018. I was in the car with my kids when six men attempted a carjacking and pulled us to the side of the road. I was assaulted, my friend was knocked out. There was so much blood. I was waiting to be shot, trying to protect my children. Everyone would benefit from therapy. I started recently and will continue for the rest of my life. When you’re in the Priory and hear other people’s stories, it’s easy to think, “God, are you only here for that? You’d never cope with my life.” I’m learning you can’t have that attitude. Trauma affects people differently. It’s taking some adjustment, not having my son Harvey at home with me. His complex needs mean looking after him is full on. It’s a relief to not have the house totally destroyed every day, but it’s hard adjusting. I expect to hear his shouts and banging; to have our cuddles and kisses. It’s left a void in my life. I miss him, but you adapt. People in the public eye who have children with complex needs are starting to be more open. It wasn’t like that before. People didn’t like to admit it, as if they were ashamed. But I’ve always been so proud of Harvey. He’s not an embarrassment. He has plenty of qualities other people don’t. It’s as simple as that. I ran for parliament in 2001. The Daily Star made me. They were mocking me. Now I’m in the Houses of Parliament campaigning for better laws and opening up people’s eyes to life for people with disabilities. Honestly, I see others getting MBEs who’ve done less than me, and I think: why not me? I love what I do. The reality shows and photoshoots… I don’t know any different. I’ve done it since I was 17. But I’ve become fair game in the press and people don’t realise how mentally damaging it can be. I feel suffocated and isolated, and don’t know where to turn for help. It’s making me paranoid. But it’s not just that I enjoy the job – I couldn’t walk away at this point even if I tried. A controversial woman in power who lived and breathed what she believed – that’s how I’d like to be remembered. That no matter what, I’d do what I wanted to, and defied the odds.

3/26/2022,"It promises to be one of Britain’s most unusual planning battles. On one side is an array of endangered wildlife that includes a species of jumping spider. On the other are backers of a theme park that they claim will rival Disneyland in its size and ambition. The park, called the London Resort, would be built on the Swanscombe peninsula on the Thames, near Gravesend, where it would cover land equivalent to 136 Wembley stadiums and would include themed rides, a water park, conference venues, hotels and a shopping centre. However, the project is highly controversial – as will be revealed this week when preliminary hearings are held. Crucially, the theme park is being proposed as a “nationally significant infrastructure project” (NSIP) – a designation usually reserved for major roads, power plants or airports. NSIPs are finally approved or rejected by the government, not by local authorities, which has raised fears that the decision over the fate of the London Resort is being moved away from community politicians and handed to ministers. “It is a real concern,” said Donna Zimmer, of the Save Swanscombe Peninsula campaign. In addition, a large chunk of the peninsula has recently been designated a “site of special scientific interest” (SSSI) because of its wide range of rare plants and wildlife. These include marsh harriers, spoonbills, otters, a wide variety of orchids, and more than 1,700 invertebrate species, including a quarter of the UK’s water beetle species and more than 200 species that are considered of conservation importance. For good measure, the peninsula is one of only two places in the UK where the critically endangered distinguished jumping spider – Attulus distinguendus – has its home. The distinguished jumping spider is tiny (about 1cm long) and does not spin webs to catch prey but uses its excellent eyesight and an ability to leap distances of more than 10 times its own length to bring down its quarry. The prospect of a theme park being built on one of only two sites in the UK where Attulus distinguendus is found, and which also supports many other key species, has outraged conservationists. Evan Bowen-Jones, chief executive of Kent Wildlife Trust, said that if built, the theme park would represent one of the single biggest losses of protected land in the UK. “We would lose an urban oasis – home to species that range from jumping spiders to marsh harriers – for plastic dinosaurs, fairground rides, and yet more gridlock and pollution at a time when the importance of nature to human wellbeing has never been clearer,” he said last week. The London Resort was originally proposed in 2014 and has been subject to widespread delays since then, hold-ups that have infuriated the project’s opponents as well as local MP Gareth Johnson, who initially backed the scheme but is now opposed to it. “Many of us were excited when this proposal was made public,” said Johnson, the Conservative MP for Dartford. “There could have been huge benefits to the area, if the project was approached in the right way. Instead, we have seen endless delays and uncertainty for local residents and businesses in the area. Enough is enough. Dartford can do better than this theme park,” he said. Other groups that were initially involved with the project have also withdrawn involvement. These include the BBC and ITV, whose shows would have provided themes for some resort’ rides. One remaining group, Paramount Entertainment, is still linked to the project and is the focus of a campaign by local people who want it to quit as well. For its part, the company says that the resort would generate 6,000 direct and many more indirect jobs within its first year. But this claim was countered by Craig Bennett, chief executive of The Wildlife Trusts. “The resort would not only wipe out the SSSI here, it would also destroy the local industrial park where about 3,000 people work. Most of these individuals have skilled jobs. These would be lost and replaced with low-skilled, seasonal jobs at the theme park.” A London Resort spokesman denied the project would cause ecological damage. “Huge parts of the land are contaminated. It is largely a brownfield, former industrial site which has been unmanaged, with zero investment for improvement, for decades,” he said, adding that London Resort was committed to investing over £150m to enhance the habitat and would be creating the world’s only carbon neutral theme parks. He also said the project was supported by most local residents and businesses. London Resort added that it had formally objected to the designation of the peninsula SSSI status and said that the BBC and ITV had not pulled out the project but had merely ended commercial agreements for use of their Intellectual Property. It is expected that at this week’s planning meeting, the London Resort company will seek to have further delays made to the planning process, while opponents will vigorously oppose such a move. “If further delays are blocked, then we will get a final decision about the project far sooner and, hopefully, one that will block the building of the resort,” said Chris Rose, a campaign consultant who has been involved in coordinating opposition to the project. The issue for the government is straightforward, added Nicky Britton-Williams, wilder towns officer for Kent Wildlife Trust. “If the government follows through on all of the commitments that ministers have made to the need to protect nature and tackle the climate emergency and put the necessary policies and plans in place, I cannot see how this project could possibly get consent.” She added: “However, stranger things have happened in politics.”",News/Environment,Rollercoasters v water voles: ‘Disney-on-Thames’ plan could devastate wildlife ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/26/plastic-t-rex-vs-rare-beetles-disney-on-thames-plan-london-devastate-wildlife

3/26/2022,"Tamara Lindeman doesn’t speak on stage often but when she does it’s like a dam breaking. “I have a lot of songs about not being heard,” she says towards the end of the show. With her bobbed hair and buttoned-up black leather frock coat, the Canadian singer-songwriter looks like a detective from a French movie. “And then I put out this record and suddenly I’m holding a microphone in front of hundreds of people and I feel very heard. It’s been one of the most beautiful experiences of my lifetime.” The implication is that if she’d had the acclaim she has now, she might not have written those songs. A lot of great pop music stems from frustration and urgency. This much-delayed show is the Weather Station’s first London appearance since the release, a year ago, of Ignorance: her fifth album and the first to get plaudits across the board. There are times when an artist plays almost all of their new record, including bonus tracks, and you sigh. Throw us a bone. Then there are times when that record is such a thrilling and unanticipated moonshot that you can’t get enough of it. Ignorance isn’t Lindeman’s latest album. She has just released How Is It That I Should Look at the Stars, a companion piece, or coda, consisting of delicate piano ballads. But both sets of songs emerged from the same emotionally gruelling period of fully confronting her sadness and anxiety about the climate crisis. They are, she says, about “feeling too much and feeling too darkly”. The fragility of the later record feels apt but what makes Ignorance such a triumph is the contrast between the gravity of the theme and the vivacity of the music, jumping from jazz to disco to motorik soft rock. Separated and Tried to Tell You suggest Fleetwood Mac if they were worrying about rising sea levels rather than divorce. You just don’t get many toe-tappers about the end of the world. Ignorance is the first great album about the climate crisis because it is human-sized rather than didactic. Her subject is climate grief, that peculiar pre-mourning for things not yet lost. If you’re not paying attention, they might sound like breakup songs. “Some days there might be nothing you encounter / To stand behind the fragile idea that anything matters,” she sings devastatingly on Tried to Tell You. Lindeman pulls into focus a subject that is existentially, brain-breakingly vast by finding revelations in fleeting moments: a sunset, a bird in flight, a conversation, “the cold, metallic scent of snow”. As she sings on her breakthrough song (and set-closer), 2017’s country-rock memoir Thirty: “I noticed fucking everything.” Bringing such a rich and diverse album to the stage with her five-person band is no small achievement. Drummer Evan Cartwright is the engine: sleek and aerodynamic on Atlantic, slithery and ominous on Robber, which opens like it’s slowly crawling out of a marsh. Lindeman likes to whip up a tempest, especially when Karen Ng is going full-tilt on the clarinet sax, then bring it to a breathtakingly abrupt stop. Her voice is a marvel, dancing between a wry, conversational lower register and a cloud-busting soprano, never more spine-tinglingly than on Better Now, which has the soaring, swooping giddiness of Kate Bush. “I saw the mountain, I saw it everywhere,” she cries, as the drums tumble in like an avalanche. On the surging new wave of Parking Lot, her most purely undeniable pop song, she sounds as if she’s telling a story from the seat of a speeding car. It can feel a bit cheap comparing a female Canadian singer-songwriter to Joni Mitchell, but there is that same precision of observation and delivery: a particular way of reading the world. Lindeman was an actor through her teens before turning to music – Canadian television viewers knew her as the star of high-school fantasy Guinevere Jones – but she’s not a theatrical performer. There’s an earnest, eyes-closed commitment to the requirements of each song and an endearing humility towards band and audience. Saying that you’re happy to be here is a pro forma routine but we’re still in that early post-Covid phase when the gratitude feels supercharged. “We can’t believe we’re here in any shape or form,” she says with credible amazement. There are bigger venues in the Weather Station’s future but there’s something precious about the hugger-mugger intimacy of this show and the attentive hush that greets the softer ballads, especially as Lindeman is singing about the struggle to communicate important things.

3/26/2022,"Three Muslim Americans filed a lawsuit this week alleging that US border officers questioned them about their religious beliefs in violation of their constitutional rights when they returned from international travel. The men involved in the lawsuit claim that US border officers at land crossings and international airports peppered them with questions about whether they were Muslim and attended a mosque and how often they prayed. Abdirahman Aden Kariye, a Minnesota imam and plaintiff in the suit, said he has been questioned about his faith at least five different times when he was returning to the country between 2017 and 2022. The repeated questioning caused Kariye stress and led him to stop wearing a Muslim cap known as a kufi, and to stop carrying religious texts when he travels internationally to avoid additional scrutiny, the lawsuit said. “I am proud to be a Muslim,” said Kariye. “But now whenever I travel back home to the United States, I’m anxious. I’m constantly worried about how I will be perceived, so much so that I try to avoid calling any attention to my faith.” The three men from Minnesota, Texas and Arizona sued Department of Homeland Security officials in a federal court in Los Angeles. The lawsuit was filed in California because some of the questioning allegedly occurred at Los Angeles airport. The American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the men, said the questioning violated the men’s constitutional rights to freedom of religion and protection against unequal treatment. “Just as border officers may not single out Christian Americans to ask what denomination they are, which church they attend, and how regularly they pray, singling out Muslim Americans for similar questions is unconstitutional,” said the lawsuit. It added: “By targeting plaintiffs for religious questioning merely because they are Muslim, defendants’ border officers stigmatize them for adhering to a particular faith and condemn their religion as subject to suspicion and distrust.” It asks a judge to declare the religious questioning was unconstitutional and to order US government agencies to expunge records containing information that was obtained through the questioning of the men. The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately return a Guardian request for comment about the lawsuit. Another plaintiff, Hameem Shah, a resident of Plano, Texas who works in financial services, said he was returning in 2019 from a vacation to Serbia and Bosnia when he was pulled aside at the Los Angeles airport for additional screening. Officers separated him from other travelers and started reading his personal journal, despite his opposition, and asked him whether he had traveled in the Middle East, saying they wanted to make sure he was a “safe person”, the lawsuit said. They also asked him about his religious beliefs and practices, and searched his phone and released him two hours later, the lawsuit said. “I thought that being an American meant that I and others are free to practice any religion that we choose,” Shah said in a statement, adding that the airport experience he had still haunts him. “Religious questioning by border officers is unconstitutional, and it’s past time for the government to be held to account,” said Ashley Gorski, senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s National Security Project. “This invasive questioning serves no legitimate law enforcement purpose, and conveys the harmful and stigmatizing message that the US government views Muslims as inherently suspicious,” she added. American border security have historically targeted and profiled Muslims for religious questioning in airports. In 2010, ACLU, along with other organizations, filed complaints to DHS regarding border questioning of Muslims about their religious beliefs and practices.",News/US news,Muslim Americans sue over US border officers’ ‘invasive’ questions on religion,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/26/muslim-americans-lawsuit-los-angeles-border-officers
3/26/2022,"Neighbours have told of their shock and sadness after a woman was stabbed to death while her two children were at school. Those who knew the 40-year-old from Bethnal Green in east London said she was “a lovely person” and that she had lived in the area for a long time. She was pronounced dead at the scene after she was discovered with stab injuries at an address on Globe Road when she failed to pick up her children from school on Thursday afternoon. Neighbours said police broke down the door of the property after the alarm was raised just after 4pm. On Saturday, police officers remained at the estate where the woman was discovered. Mohammad Shamin, 57, a local businessman, said he often saw her walking around the area with her sons and described her as a good mother. “So it was very strange when she wasn’t there for them to pick them up, that’s what caused the commotion,” he told PA news agency. “And when they found her it was very sad. People here are shocked, such a lovely person.” Another neighbour, who wished to remain anonymous, said the aftermath was “chaotic”. “People were coming over to check and see what was happening. The police came and got in, they broke the door. It’s very sad, I didn’t know her well but she seemed nice.” Others said she had lived in the area for a number of years and had two young boys around primary school age. “She’s lived here a long time, we used to see her now and again with her two young boys,” a couple who live nearby said. “They’d go out and about and were nice to have in the community.” London ambulance service pronounced the woman, who has yet to be formally identified, dead at the scene. A postmortem examination was due to take place on Saturday. Her next of kin have been informed. DCI Laurence Smith, who is leading the Met police investigation, said it was “heartbreaking”. “A dedicated team of officers is working around the clock to trace the person responsible for this and my thoughts are with this woman’s family as they come to terms with their tragic loss,” she said. “It is heartbreaking that yet another woman has been killed. All women and girls have the right to feel safe, at any time, day or night, in public or at home, and we will do everything we can to find those responsible for this.”",News/UK news,Neighbours tell of shock at fatal stabbing of woman in east London,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/26/neighbours-tell-of-shock-at-fatal-stabbing-of-woman-in-bethnal-green-east-london
3/26/2022,"New York mayor Eric Adams has ordered that every homeless encampment in the city should be taken down within two weeks, arguing that the situation is not only dangerous to those living there but to the city itself. “We’re going to rid the encampments off our street and we’re going to place people in healthy living conditions with wraparound services,” Adams said Friday, though he provided few details on exactly how that extra provision would be provided for them. “I’m looking to do it within a two-week period,” he added in an interview with the New York Times. The Times said the number of people living in parks and on the streets was estimated at at around 1,100, though that figure was likely a serious undercount. The issue of homelessness in New York has arisen amid a crime spike in the city and a series of high-profile violent attacks, though advocates point out that the city – and its homeless population – has been caught in a crisis over inadequate mental health services for many years. The debate has in recent weeks centered on the subway, the scene of a number of assaults. It flared up in recent weeks weeks as city administrators and employers mount a “Subway Safety Plan” to get workers back to offices after a two-year pandemic hiatus. Officials for the MTA, the city’s transport system, and homeless outreach workers have said they had found 29 homeless encampments in subway tunnels and another 89 in stations earlier this month. Adams said that as a former transit cop he understood how dangerous the tunnels are. “When you have those utilizing tunnel systems without any form of interaction of law enforcement, you could have a person that’s not only there to deal with the dangers of being homeless on the tracks, but you also have the potential person that’s trying to do something harmful,” he said. But he acknowledged that he could not stop homeless people from sleeping on the streets or force them to stay at a homeless shelter. “But you can’t build a miniature house made out of cardboard on the streets,” he added. “That’s inhumane.” Homeless advocates say sweeps of the subway system or clearing the streets accomplish little other than moving people from one subway stop to another or some other public space, often after losing their possessions in the process. Craig Hughes, a social worker at the Urban Justice Center, told the New York Times that such efforts leave “people more precarious than they were beforehand”. The mayor’s ultimatum was quickly followed by video released on social media by a city councilmember of an 18-year-old woman being roughly arrested by NYPD officers after she jumped a turnstile at a subway stop in Brooklyn. Her arrest came after the NYPD’s chief of crime control strategies said in a statement that the force planned to engage “in proactive enforcement can be the difference that prevents that next shooting, and prevents the next child from being harmed”. To some, that carries echoes of “broken windows”, a controversial policing policy introduced by Mayor Giuliani in the 90s that many claim unfairly targeted racial minorities and low-income people for minor infractions. Adams has said the crackdown on quality-of-life offenses is not a return to that policy. “We won’t go back to abusive policing,” he said Friday. But progressive city politicians said the incident amounted to exactly that. Local councilmember Chi Ossé compared the woman’s arrest to the subway death of an Asian woman pushed under a train by a schizophrenic homeless man last year. “Four cops were on the platform when Michelle Go was tragically pushed into the subway tracks, and the police did nothing,” Ossé posted on social media. “A Black women hops a turnstile and is confronted with four cops with cuffs, tasers, and firearms … for $2.75.”",News/US news,Mayor orders New York’s homeless camps dismantled ‘within two weeks’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/26/new-york-mayor-homeless-camps-eric-adams
