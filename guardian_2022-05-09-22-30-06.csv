5/9/2022,"Two Russian journalists working for a popular pro-Kremlin website filled it with anti-war articles on Monday morning in a rare act of dissent as the country celebrated the Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany. The articles on Lenta.ru called President Vladimir Putin a “pitiful paranoid dictator” and accused him of waging “the bloodiest war of the 21st century”. “We had to do it today. We wanted to remind everyone what our grandfathers really fought for on this beautiful Victory Day – for peace,” said 30-year-old Egor Polyakov, one of the two journalists. During his annual speech in front of 11,000 soldiers in the Kremlin on Monday morning, Putin sought to justify his invasion of Ukraine, tying the current fighting to the Soviet victory in the second world war. “This is not what Victory Day is about,” Polyakov told the Guardian in an interview. “Ordinary people are dying, peaceful women and children are dying in Ukraine. Given the rhetoric that we have seen, this isn’t going to stop. We couldn’t accept this any longer. This was the only right thing we could do.” Polyakov, who works as a business reporter at Lenta, said he and his colleague Alexandra Miroshnikova published more than 40 articles critical of the Kremlin and its actions in Ukraine. The articles have since been taken down, but can be accessed through a web archive tool. Lenta, one of the largest sites in the country with more than 200 million monthly visitors, has been part of the relentless propaganda machine used to justify Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Lenta is owned by Rambler, a media group that was bought in 2020 by Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank, which is state-owned and under US and UK sanctions. Titles on the articles written and published by Polyakov and Miroshnikova on Monday morning included “Vladimir Putin lied about Russia’s plans in Ukraine”, “The Russian army turned out to be an army of thieves and looters” and “Russia abandons the dead bodies of its troops in Ukraine.” Polyakov said each article was sourced from “information available online”, which he said he was usually not allowed to use given the outlet’s “editorial position” and strict censorship rules that in effect criminalise independent reporting. Polyakov and Miroshkina also published a personal letter on the website, which urged readers: “Don’t be afraid! Don’t be silent! Fight back! You are not alone, there are many of us! The future is ours!” It is the first major act of protest seen in Russian state media since Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor at Channel One, broke on to the set of the nightly news in mid-March shouting: “Stop the war. No to war.” Pointing to recent laws introduced by Russia aimed at stifling anti-war dissent, Polyakov said he was now “worried” for his safety. Russia has passed a number of laws making the spread of “fake” information about the Russian army an offence punishable with fines or jail terms of up to 15 years. Russian authorities have already charged 46 people under such laws, with 14 of them now behind bars. “Of course I am afraid,” Polyakov said. “I am not ashamed to admit that. But I knew what I was doing, what the consequences could be.” In a separate development, the Rutube video platform was taken down by pro-Ukrainian hackers on Sunday night, while local television menus were hacked, with programme descriptions on smart TVs replaced by a message reading: “The blood of thousands of Ukrainians and hundreds of murdered children is on your hands. TV and the authorities are lying. No to war.” State outlets have frequently been targeted by pro-Ukrainian hackers since the start of the war.",News/World news,‘Paranoid dictator’: Russian journalists fill pro-Kremlin site with anti-war articles,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/russian-journalists-pro-kremlin-site-lenta-anti-war-articles
5/9/2022,"Stefano Pioli did not need a history lesson before Milan’s visit to Verona. The tales of how these opponents twice derailed Rossoneri title runs at the Stadio Bentegodi, earning the moniker “Fatal Verona” by beating them on the final day of the 1972-73 season, then the penultimate round of 1989-90, are retold almost every time they meet. Still, this weekend was different. Eleven years on from their last Serie A title, Milan had finally clambered back to the top of the pile, only to quickly find themselves back at the scene of two of their most infamous defeats. Omens could be found even in the fine details. This time there were three games left in the season, as if Milan had climbed one more rung down the ladder that forms part of Verona’s club crest. Pioli, who played for the Scaligeri between 1987 and 1989, had no time for any of it. “We are starting to write our own history,” said Milan’s manager. “And that is written in the present.” For the longest time, Pioli had sought to deflect talk of a title, reminding journalists his side was never a pre-season favourite, insisting the objective was simply to improve on the 79 points earned last year. There is no more hiding, though, when you occupy first place after 35 games. Ever since Internazionale lost to Bologna at the end of last month, Milan have held their fate in their hands. To use that expression makes it sound straightforward. For the teams battling atop of Serie A, fate has felt forever fluid, slipping between fingers every time they try to squeeze it in their grasp. Milan, Inter and Napoli have taken turns throwing away opportunities: a defeat by Spezia here, a goalkeeping calamity there. From 10 January until the end of April there was not a single weekend when all three sides won. Within Milan’s squad, however, there has always been at least one true believer. Sandro Tonali told Corriere della Sera in November that he and his teammates felt capable of winning the Scudetto, even discussing the tattoo he planned to get if they managed it. An extraordinary show of confidence from a then-21-year-old who ended the previous campaign on the bench. Tonali has always been clear in his ambitions, writing a letter to Saint Lucy at 10 years old asking for a complete Milan kit – shirt, shorts, and socks – and whether he would get to fulfil his dream of being a professional footballer someday. He got his break with Brescia, from where he almost joined Inter, only to turn his back on them the moment his childhood club showed an interest. His first season at Milan was a mixed bag, occasional flashes of magic not enough to offset the times when he seemed overwhelmed. He was a victim of unhelpful comparisons – he had been billed as the next Andrea Pirlo, though he himself said the similarities ended with their floppy hair – but he was also just going through something normal: the growing pains of a young footballer adjusting to a new level. This season was different from the start, Tonali catching the eye with his confident physicality in Milan’s opener against Sampdoria and scoring in the next match, a 4-1 win over Cagliari. Competition for places ought to have been tough in a midfield featuring Franck Kessié and Ismaël Bennacer but he has played more than either of them. Pioli explained such development as the natural consequence of commitment. In January he defined Tonali as the best young talent he had ever coached, saying “his secret is the work he puts in every day”. Tonali has likewise shown devotion to his club, volunteering to take a lower wage in the summer as Milan wrestled with the finances required to make his initial loan from Brescia into a permanent move. He has since said he hopes to stay for ever. “I know what I did to get this shirt,” Tonali told Corriere della Sera when his interviewer dangled the prospect of a lucrative Premier League move. “I would never make the mistake of leaving.” Careers are long and unpredictable, but in the here and now it is hard to imagine either side wanting to break up a fruitful union. Milan’s title push has been a collective effort, from the centre-back play of Fikayo Tomori and Pierre Kalulu that, together with Mike Maignan’s brilliance in goal, helped Milan to keep seven clean sheets in eight games, through to Olivier Giroud’s big-game deciders up front. Lately, though, it has been Tonali who has provided the magic when his team needs it most. It was he who scored the 91st-minute winner away to Lazio on 24 April, just when it appeared that Milan were about to cede top spot to Inter. And it was Tonali again who took centre-stage in Verona on Sunday night. Once again Milan were playing catch-up, with Inter having recovered from two goals behind to beat Empoli 4-2 on Saturday night. That result temporarily moved the Nerazzurri into top spot. Tonali, celebrating his 22nd birthday on Sunday, thought he had given Milan an early lead when he outmuscled Ivan Ilic and finished smartly after a long ball forward from Maignan. A VAR review showed he had been marginally offside at the start of the move. Milan had dominated the opening exchanges, seeking to overwhelm Igor Tudor’s Verona by pressing high against a team that is known to take risks putting its players in one-on-one situations. But after Tonali’s goal was disallowed, it was the hosts who instead made the breakthrough: Davide Faraoni heading home at the end of a well-constructed team move. Fatalism could so easily have taken hold in a city that has doomed Milan before. Instead, Tonali equalised in first-half injury time, fighting for the position to convert a tap-in when Rafael Leão whipped a low cross into a crowded six-yard box. Four minutes into the second half, those players combined again for the same outcome. Milan catch Verona on the break and restore their lead in superb fashion 🤩It's brace for Sandro Tonali on his birthday and another assist for Rafael Leão. pic.twitter.com/5Zi1biPtz1 Any lingering ghosts of past defeats were ushered out of the building. Roughly half of the 30,000 fans in attendance had come to cheer the away team, and they were treated to a third goal before the end, substitute Alessandro Florenzi running on from right-back to send a thunderous finish beyond Lorenzo Montipò. The celebrations at full time were enthusiastic but measured – Milan’s players know there are still two more opponents between them and the finish line. Next up on Sunday come Atalanta, who may not be enjoying their most brilliant season in recent memory but remain a dangerous opponent chasing a European place. Genoa 2-1 Juventus, Inter 4-2 Empoli, Lazio 2-0 Sampdoria, Sassuolo 1-1 Udinese, Torino 0-1 Napoli, Verona 1-3 Milan, Salernitana 1-1 Cagliari, Venezia 4-3 Bologna, Spezia 1-3 Atalanta Pioli, though, was entitled to take a moment to reflect on another job well done. He said that getting to know his players better through the course of the season had allowed him to put together a winning gameplan, understanding he could ask Tonali, who had only scored twice in 31 league games, to play closer to goal against opponents who would leave spaces to be exploited. “I am in love with my players,” said Pioli. A dangerous emotion for some, in fair Verona. Seemingly not, though, for this Milan team.",Sport/Football,Tonali veers around Verona hoodoo to keep Milan’s title dream on track | Nicky Bandini,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/09/sandro-tonali-keeps-milan-title-dream-on-track-verona-serie-a
5/9/2022,"In 2015, Kendrick Lamar was criticised for making what many interpreted as out-of-touch comments in the wake of the Ferguson riots: “What happened to [Michael Brown] should’ve never happened. Never. But when we don’t have respect for ourselves, how do we expect them to respect us?” Arguably even more provocative was his climactic line in 2015’s The Blacker the Berry, crying “hypocrite!” at those who lamented the killing of Trayvon Martin but who were also involved in gang violence. Yet by rapping in the first person, Lamar blamed himself as much as anyone, and the track’s even fiercer invective was aimed at an apocalyptically racist US: “Your plan is to terminate my culture.” This is a key part of Lamar’s overall musical project: a sustained, fraught, fallible and passionate inquiry into the forces that tear down and build up Black America. Now, in The Heart Part 5 – the fifth track in his “Heart” series that began in 2010, and an expected inclusion on his new album Mr Morale & the Big Steppers, released this Friday – Lamar continues to consider these hard questions, but always couched in that wider context: America as a place where generations of racism, first federally mandated then institutionalised, have come to bear on his community. After jaded lines about violence and death, he raps: “In the land where hurt people hurt more people / Fuck calling it culture,” calling for a reframing of the way Black America is spoken of and thought about, and lampoons the way its complex social issues and individual circumstances are simplified: “Somebody called, said your lil’ nephew was shot down, the culture’s involved,” a deeply sarcastic line. Once again, he seems to be addressing his own community as well as a broader America – but he acknowledges that violence is often the reaction of the victimised. “Desensitised, I vandalised pain” is an astonishingly economical phrasing that is honest and tender about the self-perpetuating nature of all forms of violence, and Lamar always remembers the social and psychological histories that make up a person: “Make the wrong turn, be it will or the wheel alignment,” he raps, a portrait of how a mess of personal agency and social conditioning comes to bear on every decision. This is music of gigantic humanity and understanding; appropriately, his flow is as charged and acute as it has ever been. Lamar’s intense care for his people scales up even further in the heartstopping final verse. In the music video, he morphs into “deepfake” versions of oft-criticised Black celebrities including Kanye West, Jussie Smollett, OJ Simpson and Will Smith, a visual expression of Lamar’s determined empathy. During this final verse, he appears as Nipsey Hussle, the LA rapper who was shot and killed in 2019. Lamar refers to his grief over his death earlier in the track, and a line, “Sam, I’ll be watching over you”, seems to refer to Hussle’s older brother. This verse, then, is voiced from the perspective of the late Hussle, asserting that he is in heaven, forgiving his killer and speaking with satisfaction about what he achieved when he was alive. Some may find this emotionally manipulative or unethical, but Lamar has often expressed admiration for Hussle in the past and the verse feels true to an artist who was devoted to uplifting his community through regeneration projects and business opportunities. “You can’t help the world until you help yourself,” Lamar says as Hussle, and this is ultimately Lamar’s credo. Some will say he puts too much impetus on the Black community to do the work of governments and institutions – can you always help yourself before the world helps you? But as Lamar continues to document, you are a product of your environment, and the US, for better and more often for worse, has that mantra of self-actualisation at its core (he is also likely informed by the understandable lack of faith the Black community has in institutions to have their interests at heart). Amid the song’s ambiguities, Lamar’s own love for his community is never in doubt. The backing track reworks I Want You, perhaps Marvin Gaye’s most purely erotic song – where the emphasis is just as much on the wanting itself as it is the particular person. In that desire, Lamar divines Gaye’s innate social conscience, changing the title line from one of lust to one of hope, using the urgent disco rhythm to perfectly impart the seriousness of his feeling. “I want you,” Lamar says as the track’s final line, a statement of pure fraternal need. And perhaps encouragement – there are endless implied words that come next. Back on the first part of the Heart series in 2010, he said, “I make a way for my people to see the light,” and that remains his mission.",Arts/Music,Kendrick Lamar: The Heart Part 5 review – a heartstopping call for uplifted humanity,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/09/kendrick-lamar-the-heart-part-5-review-a-heartstopping-call-for-uplifted-humanity
5/9/2022,"On the final day of Bristol’s New Music festival, reasserting itself after the inevitable pandemic hiatus, two groups put on concerts with a considerable variety of composers. Birmingham Contemporary Music Group paid tribute to the late Harrison Birtwistle, with two Elliott Carter works, of which the reflective ending of 1990s Con Leggerezza Pensosa felt particularly appropriate. And, in recognition of what would have been Oliver Knussen’s 70th birthday next month and of his long and fruitful association with BCMG, there were two pieces by him. Gems of instrumental solos, Secret Psalm for violin and Eccentric Melody for cello, were played by Collette Overdijk and Ulrich Heinen respectively. Eloquent and expressive, it was notable that it was Knussen’s music that commanded the most hushed, rapt attention. Artistic director Stephan Meier conducted when the full quintet of players were involved, but he also marshalled the audience for the clapping and ssshh-ing in Birtwistle’s Roddy’s Reel. Mark O’Brien was the brilliant bass clarinettist in this good-humoured finale where the smiles that Birtwistle clearly intended were everywhere. While BCMG were dealing with pure, unadulterated sounds in the pleasing setting of the Arnolfini gallery, Wales’s contemporary music ensemble Uproar – strings, wind, harp, piano and percussion – were in the dryer acoustic of the gallery’s theatre, but all hooked up and into electronics. Three substantial works by composers connected with Paris and IRCAM offered the main thrust of their programme, taking Fausto Romitelli’s Professor Bad Trip with its intentionally psychedelic aura as the concert’s title. Kaija Saariaho’s Lichtbogen, from 1986 and inspired by the Northern Lights, and Tristan Murail’s Winter Fragments (2000) each had icy, crystalline elemental qualities, even if these composers would not necessarily have been referencing the environmental crisis at their time of writing. In we watch it burn, the first of the three interleaving premieres commissioned from Welsh composers, Sarah Lianne Lewis invoked the words of climate activist Greta Thunberg. The sonic explosions were akin to the sparks that start bush and forest fires, and while there were no obvious conflagrations in the music, only rising panic, the dying splutter of strings proved most telling. Devil’s Elbow by Bethan Morgan-Williams mixed anguish with playfulness and, again in the spirit of IRCAM, used live electronics to intrigue the ear. Andrew Lewis’s Canzon in Double Echo, with its interplay of instruments with electronically manipulated material, is a score that succeeds in being always aurally engaging. It had a wholly organic rather than fragmentary feel, and of the new pieces, was the one that stood up to any comparison with the Parisian electronic world. Michael Rafferty conducted with his usual unflappable authority.",Arts/Music,"BCMG, Uproar review – Bristol New Music festival closes with sparks, ssshh-ing and smiles",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/09/bcmg-uproar-review-bristol-new-music-festival-closes-with-sparks-ssshh-ing-and-smiles
5/9/2022,"Dennis Waterman, who has died suddenly aged 74, was such a familiar face on television for more than 40 years, playing similar sorts of streetwise characters, that it is hard to imagine that he was once a child actor in Hollywood and appeared in the opening season of the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1960. He also featured on the West End stage – in 1961, he led the first act closing number in Meredith Willson’s The Music Man at the Adelphi theatre. He is indelibly associated with two of the most successful television series of all time, both shown on ITV: The Sweeney (four series, 1975-78), co-starring with John Thaw as members of the flying squad branch of the Metropolitan police tackling violent crime and armed robbery; and Minder (1979-1994, with two extended breaks in the overall 10 series), playing the hapless gofer and bodyguard Terry McCann to George Cole’s dodgy wheeler-dealer Arthur Daley. Unmistakably and always a south Londoner, Waterman was a tough nut, detective sergeant George Carter, in The Sweeney, a series that coincided with an extensive inquiry into corruption inside the Met itself. In Minder, more of a sitcom than a serious crime drama, he revealed a more winning streak of vulnerability and ineptitude in a wonderfully evoked milieu of the criminal underside in west London. Several other sitcom and crime drama series employed him throughout the 1990s before his third major long-running success in the BBC’s New Tricks (2002-14). Alongside James Bolam and Alun Armstrong, he played a retired police officer, Gerry Standing, part of a “cold case” squad specially formed to reinvestigate unsolved murders and other crimes. As in The Sweeney, where he and Thaw had to contend with an officiously demanding detective chief inspector (Garfield Morgan), he often crossed swords with his New Tricks detective boss (Amanda Redman). These hierarchical tensions allowed him to display quite a subtle range of hard-headedness, seething resentment and bitterness. The happy-go-lucky, rackety “Jack the Lad” image was not one Waterman had any problem in developing. He cheerfully admitted that acting came easily to him as an extension of his own personality and outlook in life. Drink, women and football were his cornerstone activities. Some of that spilled into darker areas, with drink-driving convictions and accusations of domestic violence from his third wife, the actor Rula Lenska, claims he discussed openly in a television interview with Piers Morgan 10 years ago. Waterman, born in Clapham, south-west London, was the youngest (by six years) of nine children brought up on a council estate in nearby Putney. His father, Harry Waterman, was a ticket collector at Clapham Junction station, his mother, Rose (nee Saunders), made curtains and soft furnishings. Dennis attended Granard primary school in Putney and, after being inducted into the theatre by an elder sister who was busy in amateur dramatics, trained at the Corona stage school in Hammersmith. One of his brothers became a professional welterweight boxing champion, another joined the RAF, and three of Dennis’s sisters ended up working in the film industry in Los Angeles. Even before he joined the RSC, Dennis had appeared as Moth in Love’s Labour’s Lost in Brixton town hall and had made his first movie, Night Train for Inverness (1960), playing the kidnapped diabetic son of a newly released prisoner. At Stratford-upon-Avon, in Peter Hall’s first RSC season, he was a boy player in The Taming of the Shrew, starring Peggy Ashcroft and Peter O’Toole, and young Mamillius, son of Eric Porter’s ragingly jealous Leontes, in The Winter’s Tale. After completing that Hollywood gig, recording a sitcom, Fair Exchange, starring Judy Carne, for Lucille Ball’s production company, he was cast by Peter Wood, who had directed The Winter’s Tale, in Graham Greene’s strangely religious Carving a Statue (1964) at the Haymarket; he played the recalcitrant son of an eccentric sculptor played by Ralph Richardson. This led to the most significant period of Waterman’s theatre career, at the Royal Court in Sloane Square, a place he described as his drama school. Over three years, 1965-68, he appeared in two controversial plays by Edward Bond – Saved (1965) and Early Morning (1968) – which, as a result of being banned by the lord chamberlain, and performed in less than watertight club conditions, led to the abolition of censorship in the Theatres Act of 1968. In Saved, Waterman’s disaffected teenager, Colin, was the first of the gang to throw a stone at the baby in the pram in the park. In Early Morning, which presented a lesbian relationship between Queen Victoria (Moira Redmond) and Florence Nightingale (Marianne Faithfull), he played another miscreant teenager who cannibalises a character standing in front of him in a queue. Both plays, directed by William Gaskill, met with a hostile reception from most critics and audiences, but are now rated modern classics. Also at the Court, Waterman played Fabian in Twelfth Night and Nick, the bastard son of Sir Walter Whorehound, in Thomas Middleton’s tumultuous Jacobean city comedy A Chaste Maid in Cheapside. There followed a series of movies before he hit the small screen big-time: the 1968 inferior retread of Ken Loach’s television drama Up the Junction; My Lover, My Son (1970), a modern version of the Oedipus myth, in which Romy Schneider offered the wrong sort of mother love to Waterman as her murderous son; and Roy Ward Baker’s Scars of Dracula (1970) in which Christopher Lee, on the point of impaling Waterman on the castle turrets, was struck by lightning and engulfed in flames. He returned to the RSC in 1978 for a revival of a famous old 19th-century American comedy, Saratoga by Bronson Howard, and returned to musicals in 1982 playing the manipulative journalist Hildy Johnson in another American stage landmark, a musical version by Dick Vosburgh and Tony Macaulay of the great newsroom comedy The Front Page by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur. This was highly enjoyable, though Michael Billington opined that The Front Page needed music like the Sahara needed sand. Music, though, was a serious string to Waterman’s bow. He had enjoyed a pop chart success with his recording of the theme tune of Minder (co-written by his second wife, the actor Patricia Maynard), I Could Be So Good for You, and did likewise on several other of his TV shows, a habit that led to a satirical spoof – which he loved – on the Little Britain comedy show. Many fine actors succeeded O’Toole in the title role of Keith Waterhouse’s Jeffrey Bernard Is Unwell (1989) and it was Waterman’s turn in 1993, when he played the role in Australia, then on tour in Britain, opening at the Theatre Royal, Bath. His most notable later stage appearance, though, was in the National Theatre’s revival of My Fair Lady in 2001, with Martine McCutcheon as Eliza Doolittle and Jonathan Pryce as Professor Higgins. Waterman’s dustman Doolittle rescued the role from Stanley Holloway knees-up cosiness in a spectacular stag night scene (I’m Getting Married in the Morning) on a manic pub crawl complete with dancing girls in black bodices and fishnet tights. His last movie, Never Too Late (2020), was filmed in Australia, a comedy drama with four Vietnam war veterans planning a second escape from depressing circumstances in their residential retirement home. Waterman, a fanatical supporter of Chelsea FC, had a home in Spain, where he died. Three marriages ended in divorce; he is survived by his fourth wife, Pam Flint, whom he married in 2011, and by two daughters from his second marriage, Hannah – an actor who appeared in EastEnders as Laura Beale – and Julia.

5/9/2022,"This should have been the day in which Freiburg made all their dreams come true. Sat in fourth place in the Bundesliga, with rivals RB Leipzig having come off a dreadful week of domestic defeat and European disappointment, they were set – with the sun out and their still-spanking-new Europa-Park Stadion full to its near-35,000 capacity, they were ready to celebrate. “It was actually arranged perfectly by the football gods,” wrote Florian Schmieder of Badische Zeitung. Enter Union Berlin, a club who inspire feelings of great affection off the pitch but on it are brutally realistic. Not that there is anything wrong with that, of course. Urs Fischer has done an incredible job with Union, making them unquestionably the capital’s best team on a relative shoestring. Yet stories of football romance are meant to be beautiful chaos and in a sporting sense, Union thrive on order. As a club, they are the dream of many neutrals. As a team, they are the stuff of many opponents’ worst nightmares. They were certainly Freiburg’s on Saturday afternoon. The carnival all but turned into a wake as Union were ruthlessly efficient. They had relatively little of the ball but powered by a sensational first-half display from Sheraldo Becker, they couldn’t be stopped. Becker’s teasing cross was thighed on to a post by Maxi Eggestein for Grischa Prömel to tap in the first. An even better delivery from the same player was emphatically headed in by Christopher Trimmel for number two and Becker himself pounced on a Nico Schlotterbeck misjudgment to go solo and smash in from an angle, giving Union a 3-0 half-time lead. They sat in defended in an exemplary fashion and trimmed Freiburg apart on the counter almost at will. Christian Streich’s side had their hard luck story, with a potential equaliser by Lucas Höler at 1-0 ruled out on review for a handball, which looked borderline at most. Streich being Streich, he didn’t attempt to hide behind the VAR consternation despite acknowledging that it made him perplexed (“maybe I’m visually impaired but taking away that goal is madness”), following on from his touchline anger at the time. “We defended badly as a group,” he admitted, “and it’s not acceptable at this level.” Almost inevitably Leipzig took advantage, working off their Europa League frustrations with an ultimately emphatic 4-0 win over Augsburg to leapfrog back into fourth place. The sense now is that Freiburg’s chance has gone. On the final day they would have to win at Leverkusen – though Die Werkself’s own sealing of third place and a Champions League return with an exciting 4-2 win at Hoffenheim might raise hopes of some pre-holiday relaxing – while Leipzig lost at Arminia Bielefeld. UNION IN EUROPE 🛫🇪🇺 pic.twitter.com/yBzpO4Y0gb After a weekend in which the Bundesliga was full of the unexpected, maybe we shouldn’t rule it out. Saturday did also see Köln supporters on the pitch in their thousands after their last home game of the campaign to celebrate their team’s season, despite a deflating loss at home to Wolfsburg. “I don’t feel like celebrating today,” said their coach Steffen Baumgart, “but when I look at the table you can see me grinning inside.” The day began with the outside chance of a Champions League place themselves in front of a sold-out Rhein-Energie Stadion. It ended with at least a Europa Conference League spot assured and the locals were grateful for it. That, in time, should be where Freiburg heads are at. Their fans received them warmly at full-time despite the disappointment. It has been a magnificent campaign of way-above-par standard, in a new stadium with a big future to be written – and maybe more so on Saturday week, when they face Leipzig in the DfB Pokal final. This was a major setback, but the season is far from over. Perhaps there was recognition of Union’s achievement too. This made sure they will be playing European football again next season, probably a tier up from this term in the Europa Conference League, and definitely in – irony of ironies – Olympiastadion again. That they did it after losing the iconic Max Kruse in January makes it even more of a coup. This was a typical example of the sort of discipline and structure that has made them so respected. Streich will continue to be respected, and loved, too, no matter how this season finishes. Freiburg were close to making the near-impossible happen and even if the stumble hurts, many will be grateful to this team simply for making us dream. Few would begrudge him some silverware to go with the storylines that his team have thrilled us with. Bochum 2-1 Arminia Bielefeld, Hertha Berlin 1-2 Mainz, Hoffenheim 2-4 Bayer Leverkusen, Greuther Furth 1-3 Borussia Dortmund, Freiburg 1-4 Union Berlin, Cologne 0-1 Wolfsburg, RB Leipzig 4-0 FC Augsburg, Bayern Munich 2-2 Stuttgart, Eintracht Frankfurt 1-1 Mönchengladbach  Union’s neighbours Hertha could have made themselves safe by beating Mainz in front of a busy Olympiastadion. Instead, Stefan Bell’s late header left them hanging on the result of Stuttgart’s match at Bayern Munich to see if they still had the possibility of falling into the relegation playoff spot or not. Felix Magath had already had his say about Bayern’s preceding trip to Ibiza, as discussed last week (“As a professional, which I consider myself to be,” he said after the Mainz game, “I’m preparing for the worst-case scenario”) and his concerns were at least partly realised. The Portuguese teenager Tiago Tomás scored a brilliant opener and despite Bayern coming back to lead, Sasa Kalajdžić’s header earned Pellegrino Materazzo’s team a point. It all means that if Stuttgart were to beat Köln on Saturday and Hertha lost at Borussia Dortmund, it would be the Berliners in the playoff spot, given their far worse goal difference. Stuttgart’s point and comparative goal difference also means Arminia Bielefeld are almost certainly relegated after Friday late loss at Bochum.  Bayern received and celebrated the Bundesliga title at the end of a strange afternoon, in which they looked all at sea at the back as Niklas Süle sat on the bench for the first hour (“many coaches wouldn’t give him a minute,” retorted Julian Nagelsmann with reference to Süle’s imminent departure) and Kingsley Coman was sent off in the last minute of stoppage time for whacking Konstantinos Mavropanos.  It is likely that either Stuttgart or Hertha will face Hamburg, surging at the Bundesliga 2 season’s end, in what would be a titanic playoff. It won’t be Schalke, though, who sealed a return to the top flight at the first attempt with a thrilling comeback from two down to beat HSV’s city rivals St Pauli. Powered by second-tier cheat code Simon Terrode, who scored twice to take his tally to 29 for the season, Die Königsblauen’s emotional celebration on the pitch with fans at full-time underlined exactly how much pressure they had been under to fulfil the brief.  Dortmund, then, have the Revierderby to look forward to again in 2022-23, and they can’t wait for next season to start, despite clinching second in a scratchy 3-1 win at Greuther Fürth. All the talk projected ahead, with incoming sporting director Sebastian Kehl’s pre-match statement that he was “assuming” Marco Rose would still be head coach next season understandably jumped on (Kehl later played this down), while this week should see the departure of Erling Haaland and Salzburg’s Karim Adeyemi confirmed as his replacement.",Sport/Football,Freiburg’s football gods go missing as Champions League dream dissolves | Andy Brassell,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/09/freiburg-bundesliga-champions-league-dream-dissolves-union-berlin
5/9/2022,"MI5 asked police chiefs to collect information about the political activities of schoolchildren as young as 14, a public inquiry into undercover policing has heard. The request – circulated to chief constables throughout Britain in 1975 – was approved by the head of the Security Service and a senior Whitehall official. An undercover police unit regularly stored files recording the political beliefs of schoolchildren, along with photographs of them. These included reports on a 17-year-old who was said to spend “a lot of his spare time” at his girlfriend’s home, and two schoolboys, then 14 and 16, who were described by the covert officers as “effeminate”. Among those spied on were schoolchildren who were campaigning against fascists who were carrying out violent attacks on vulnerable ethnic minorities. Details of MI5’s top-secret request were disclosed to the public inquiry into the undercover policing scandal, which restarted on Monday. The inquiry – headed by the retired judge Sir John Mitting – is examining how undercover police officers spied on 1,000 mainly leftwing political groups over more than 40 years. The inquiry was set up after a slew of revelations about the conduct of the undercover spies including deceiving women into intimate relationships and monitoring grieving families. Over the next two weeks, the inquiry will question managers of the covert unit the Special Demonstration Squad, who were responsible for authorising and supervising the early stages of the infiltration operations between 1968 and 1982. The current round of public hearings opened with a statement from David Barr QC, lead counsel to the inquiry. Barr disclosed previously secret documents that suggest senior Whitehall officials had in the 1970s questioned whether too much information about political activists was being collected by the police, but had apparently not acted on their concerns. For years, MI5 and undercover police officers worked closely to spy on thousands of political activists and compile huge files logging their activities. This large-scale surveillance has drawn accusations that the state violated the civil liberties of activists who were engaged in peaceful and lawful campaigning. Barr highlighted the request circulated by MI5 to chief constables in December 1975, about what it called “subversive activity in schools”. MI5 said it wanted information about “older pupils (14 or over) who are active in subversive organisations which are exploited for subversive purposes”. It also requested details of teachers who “are using their position for subversive purposes, eg attempting to convert pupils or making school premises available to subversive organisations”. Barr said MI5 recognised the “sensitivity” of the request as it had added: “We do not ask you to make enquiries in schools on our behalf, but we would welcome any help you could give us on the basis of information which comes your way from the local papers or from members of the public, or by recourse to other sources outside schools which you can use without risk of embarrassment”. He said the request had been approved by Sir Michael Hanley, the then director general of MI5, and Sir Arthur Peterson, then the Home Office’s most senior civil servant. Barr added the request could explain why undercover police officers had spied on children involved in political activism, citing their “extensive” reports on a group called School Kids Against the Nazis (SKAN). Large numbers of schoolchildren joined this group in the 1970s to oppose fascists recruiting supporters in schools. The inquiry has previously examined reports on SKAN that were compiled by Paul Gray, an undercover officer who infiltrated the Socialist Workers party (SWP) and the Anti-Nazi League between 1978 and 1982. Gray told the inquiry last year that “no consideration was given by me to the appropriateness of reporting on children. They were active members of the SWP taking part in demonstrations.” Gray had also said these reports updated existing police files on the school pupils and would enable police to identify them at future demonstrations. Barr highlighted documents that he said showed that in the late 1970s, senior officials within the Home Office had concerns about the extent of the police’s surveillance of political activists. They noted for instance that one young man was monitored “because of some badges he was wearing when he passed through Dover which indicated that he was opposed to racism”.",News/UK news,"MI5 asked police to spy on political activities of children, inquiry hears",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/09/mi5-asked-police-to-spy-on-political-activities-of-children-inquiry-hears
