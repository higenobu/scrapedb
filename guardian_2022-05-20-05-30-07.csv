5/20/2022,"Tiger Woods was suffering enough without being afforded front-row viewing as Rory McIlroy raced into the lead at the 104th staging of the US PGA Championship. As McIlroy was rolling back the years – a 65 is the Northern Irishman’s finest start to a major since the 2011 US Open, which he won easily – Woods provided a grim reminder of the scale of his ongoing physical struggles. Woods, playing in just his second event since his right leg was shattered in a car crash in February last year, actually opened brightly at Southern Hills. He birdied the 10th hole, his 1st, and sat two under par after five. Yet by the time Woods limped heavily towards post-round media duties, he had signed for a 74 and was in obvious pain. “My leg is not feeling as good as I would like it to be,” he said. “We’ll start the recovery process and get after it tomorrow. I just can’t load it. Loading hurts, pressing off it hurts, walking hurts and twisting hurts. It’s just golf. If I don’t play that, then I’m all right.” Which, given Woods is so intrinsically linked to this sport, seems like a pretty big problem. This is early in Woods’s latest comeback process but there may be a time in the not-so-distant future when he questions whether his body can withstand golf at the highest level. The 15-time major champion added: “I did not hit a lot of good iron shots. I drove it well but my iron shots were not very good. I didn’t get the ball very close. I got off to a great start and didn’t keep it going. I really didn’t give myself any looks for birdie. I was struggling trying to get the ball on the green and I missed quite a few iron shots both ways. It was a frustrating day.” There was a time when McIlroy would have been intimidated by a major partnership with his idol. On a gusty first round in Tulsa, McIlroy took everything in his stride. He had reached six under par through 14 holes. Bogeys at McIlroy’s 15th and 17th threatened to switch the appearance of a terrific round. The winner of this tournament in 2012 and 2014 converted from 19ft at the last to ensure a five-under-par day’s work. This felt significant; McIlroy now has the fast start in a major he has been chasing for so long. He leads the Americans Will Zalatoris and Tom Hoge by one. Matt Kuchar and Mexico’s Abraham Ancer sit at minus three. “It is a great start but I’m not getting ahead of myself,” said McIlroy. “I could easily have shot 68 or 69 today and not led but if I had played the same golf I still would have been as positive about it as I am now. “I hit some great tee shots, some great iron shots and holed some nice putts. I did pretty much everything you need to do out there today. I’m going to have to keep doing that over the next three days if I’m going to have a chance to win.” The third member of the event’s marquee group, Jordan Spieth, looked out of sorts when en route to a 72. His dreams of completing a career grand slam here remain alive but only just. The 1991 winner of this tournament, John Daly, using a cart, was prominent on the leaderboard at two under but bogeyed four of the last five holes to post 72. The 56-year-old was not of a mind to discuss his round. Cameron Smith’s 68 was impressive given it included a double bogey and three bogeys. “My game felt really good, the scorecard just said otherwise at times,” the Australian said. The Scot Robert MacIntyre, seeking to make it nine cuts out of nine in majors, began with a 70. Lee Westwood’s 75 was overshadowed by reports that one of his long-time sponsor, UPS, has ended its association with the Englishman because of his desire to be part of the Saudi Arabian-backed LIV Golf Series. Sean Bratches, LIV’s chief commercial officer, is believed to have resigned his post. On a day when McIlroy displayed the best of golf, these traces of a conscience were similarly endearing.",Sport/Sport,Rory McIlroy takes lead at US PGA as Tiger Woods struggles with leg pain,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/19/us-pga-day-one-rory-mcilroy-tiger-woods-golf
5/20/2022,"Oklahoma’s Republican-led legislature passed the nation’s strictest abortion ban on Thursday. The bill, if signed into law, would allows citizens to sue anyone, anywhere who “aids or abets” a patient in terminating a pregnancy. The bill bans abortion from conception, even before an egg implants in the uterus, and would go into effect immediately if signed by Republican governor Kevin Stitt. Abortion providers expect he will do so before the coming week. Like a six-week abortion ban in Texas, Oklahoma’s bill would be enforced by citizens. It would allow anyone, anywhere to sue for $10,000 and “emotional distress”, even if they do not have a relationship to the patient in question. Oklahoma’s bill, “is not one more ban, it is not another ban – it is a first,” said Emily Wales, interim president and CEO of President of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which serves patients in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. The law, “encourages bounty hunters to sue their neighbors”, and is a “reversal of history happening before our eyes”. The bill is part of an aggressive push in Republican-led states across the country to scale back abortion rights. “It’s outrageous, and it’s just the latest in a series of extreme laws from around the country,” Vice-President Kamala Harris said in reaction to the law. She said the new bans were designed to “punish and control women”. It comes on the heels of an unprecedented leaked draft opinion from the supreme court, which suggested a majority of conservative justices support a total reversal of Roe v Wade. The landmark decision legalized abortion nearly 50 years ago and invalidated dozens of state abortion bans. A final ruling in a key case from Mississippi, called Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, is expected next month. If the final decision does not change substantially from the leaked draft, the court would effectively return the issue of legal abortion to the state. At least 26 states would be certain or likely to ban abortion. The leaked opinion sparked uproar from Americans who support abortion access, a roughly two-thirds majority according to polls, and human rights leaders. The Oklahoma bill by Collinsville Republican representative Wendi Stearman would prohibit all abortions in the state, except to save the life of a pregnant woman or if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest that has been reported to law enforcement. “Is our goal to defend the right to life or isn’t it?” Stearman asked her colleagues before the bill passed on a 73-16 vote mostly along party lines. At least one lawmaker suggested the bill did not go far enough, and suggested also banning treatment for ectopic pregnancies, a life-threatening medical condition in which an embryo implants inside the fallopian tubes. An ectopic pregnancy is never viable. “These people have no idea what they’re talking about, and they are making laws controlling our medical practice and people’s basic rights,” said Dr Iman Alsaden, medical director of Planned Parenthood Great Plains. The bill is one of at least three abortion bans sent to Stitt this year. The other laws include a six-week abortion ban and a criminal abortion ban, though the way the laws will interact is not yet known. The criminal abortion ban, set to take effect this summer if Roe falls, would make it a felony to perform an abortion punishable by up to 10 years in prison, with no exceptions for rape or incest. The lead attorney on challenges to Oklahoma’s various abortion bans, Rabia Muqaddam from the Center for Reproductive Rights, called the legislature “extraordinarily sloppy”. “My understanding is the most restrictive law that take effect latest controls, but it is extraordinarily bizarre,” said Muqaddam. “We’re challenging everything as it comes.” The laws passed by Oklahoma also have an outsized effect on women in Texas, the state which pioneered civil enforcement of abortion bans. Oklahoma was briefly a haven state for Texan patients, after the supreme court allowed Texas to ban abortion at six weeks in 2021 September. “At this point, we are preparing for the most restrictive environment politicians can create: a complete ban on abortion with likely no exceptions,” said Wales. “It’s the worst-case scenario for abortion care in the state of Oklahoma,” she added.",News/US news,Oklahoma Republican-led legislature passes nation’s strictest abortion ban ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/19/oklahoma-abortion-ban-strictest
5/20/2022,"It’s no real surprise that someone was prepped to poke fun at Hollywood’s increasingly aggressive remaking, rebooting and remixing of dust-caked IP, but it’s perhaps more of a surprise to find the joke coming from inside the house. Not just any house either but the house of mouse, arguably the most egregious offender of all. But the unending sift of studios trawling though their back catalogues (this year promises new spins on Gremlins, Three Man and a Baby, Father of the Bride, Frasier, Scooby Doo, Night at the Museum, Hellraiser, Matilda and many, many others), has resulted in an unusual satire, made even more unusual given the unlikely packaging. The relatively un-hyped release of a live-action-animation-hybrid movie based on late 80s series Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers, offloaded onto Disney+, seemed at first glance to be more of the same. But inside the Trojan horse of a lazily inevitable kids adventure is a surprisingly sharp and detailed comedy. It’s not quite on par with Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, the film it undoubtedly wants to be likened to, but it’s infinitely better than it had any right to be. The original series, which lasted for three seasons on the Disney Channel, was based on one of those strange fever-dream setups that kids accepted with unquestioning immediacy. Two semi-clothed chipmunks ran a detective agency with two mice – one Australian, cheese-obsessed, and one blonde, object of numerous crushes – and a housefly. In the world of the movie, the characters were all just actors, living and working in a society where humans and cartoons co-exist. Chip (voiced by John Mulaney) and Dale (voiced by Andy Samberg) were childhood best friends who fell out after Hollywood greed and ambition drove them apart and years later, they both live very different, yet very lonely, lives. Chip works in insurance and dotes on his pet dog while Dale desperately clings on to his old fame, haunting fan conventions, waiting for a reboot. When their old friend and co-worker Monterey Jack goes missing, the pair are reunited and uncover a horrifying plot that sees well-known animated characters kidnapped, redrawn and bootlegged to be sold overseas and forced into terrible off-brand movies (The Little Mermaid becomes The Small Fish Lady, Beauty and the Beast becomes Beauty and the Cursed Dog Man etc). What’s most surprising about a mostly rather surprising film is just how intricate the world-building is, director Akiva Schaffer, of Lonely Island fame, and Crazy Ex-Girlfriend writers Dan Gregor and Doug Mand, putting far more thought and effort into the specifics of one scene that most mainstream film-makers would put into their entire movie. It’s stuffed to the edges with pop culture references, sight gags and sly jabs at the industry but falls short of the brain-dead overload that’s tanked adjacent examples. Last year’s one-two gut-punch of Free Guy and Space Jam 2 showed two studios chucking everything they had into a blender, both needlessly packed with often bizarre references to other films and shows also available on Disney and Warner’s respective streamers. It reached parody-level (did one of Ken Russell’s nuns from The Devils really need to be watching LeBron James play basketball with Bugs Bunny?) and the team behind Chip ‘n Dale seem highly aware of this, lightly ribbing the headache-inducing state of entertainment (posters for Meryl Streep as Mr Doubtfire and Fast and the Furious with Babies litter background billboards). There’s also a great deal of fun to be had at the expense of animated progress with Dale undergoing surgery to look more CGI, an amusing trip to the ‘uncanny valley’ where the pair encounter ghoulish motion capture characters from the 2000s and a scene-stealing cameo from Ugly Sonic, aka the grotesque, fan-loathed version of the character from the recent film’s original trailer. It’s all very much aimed at a savvy thirtysomething audience, while remaining kid-friendly and while younger viewers might find it all a little incomprehensible at times, the many Disney cameos and the frantic pace should ensure at least some interest. Despite the stacked cast of comedians and comedic actors (as well as Mulaney and Samberg, there are voice roles for Seth Rogen, Tim Robinson, Keegan Michael-Key and Will Arnett) the script feels a few punch-ups away from being quite as funny as it could have been. It’s more likely to produce some “oh yeah that’s smart” smiles than genuine laughter, still a little hemmed in by the Disney+-ness of it all. But what Gregor and Mand do manage is a neat balance of tone, the knowing satire never falling into self-referential smugness thanks to a healthy dose of both earnestness and a genuine affection for the source material. Consider those low expectations truly rescued.

5/20/2022,"Property tycoon Nick Candy is considering making an offer to buy the £1.4bn online shopping group THG, formerly known as The Hut Group, which recently said it had rejected numerous “unacceptable” takeover approaches that undervalue the company. Candy, a donor to the Conservative party with a fortune estimated at £1.5bn who is married to former Neighbours actor Holly Vallance, now has until 16 June to make a formal bid or walk away under UK takeover rules. “Candy Ventures confirms that it is in the very early stages of considering a possible offer for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of [THG],” the company said in a statement to the London Stock Exchange on Thursday. “There can be no certainty that any offer will be made, nor as to the terms of any such offer.” Candy – a Chelsea supporter who was recently linked with a bid for the Premier League club after it was put up for sale by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, who has been hit with sanctions since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine – confirmed the approach but refused to elaborate. “I can’t talk right now, I am about to go into a premiere,” he said, ahead of the first UK screening of Tom Cruise’s sequel to Top Gun at London’s Leicester Square. “I can’t comment on that anyway.” Candy Ventures acknowledged the “recent press speculation” about THG attracting bidder interest, which has galvanised his investment vehicle to explore a potential offer. Last month, Manchester-based THG said it had dismissed “numerous” recent takeover approaches as “unacceptable”. THG, which runs beauty and nutrition websites including Lookfantastic, Cult Beauty and Myprotein, said there had been interest from third parties but was not at that time involved in any talks. THG’s share price, which was down 4% at close on Thursday but could surge on the bid interest when markets open on Friday morning, is currently languishing at 116p. The company floated at 500p in September 2020, and peaked at 837p last September. The company is attempting to recover from a tough year when it faced criticism for allowing boss and founder Matt Moulding to serve as both executive chair and chief executive, which is against best corporate governance practice. The board also signed off on a deal that allowed Moulding to acquire a raft of THG properties before leasing them back to the company for millions of pounds a year. Last year, the company reported a 35% increase in revenues to £2.2bn, helping push adjusted earnings up 7% at £161m. In its results for the first quarter this year THG’s revenues rose by 16% to £520m.",News/Business,Property tycoon Nick Candy considering bid to take over THG,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/19/property-tycoon-nick-candy-considering-takeover-of-thg
