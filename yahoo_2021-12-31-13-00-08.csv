12/31/2021,"On CNN‚Äôs Erin Burnett Out Front Tuesday, fill-in host Poppy Harlow spoke with CNN medical analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner about all things COVID-19, and got his reaction to comments made by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) on Fox News during their Monday primetime block, regarding the safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines. ‚ÄúWe all hoped and prayed the vaccines would be 100 percent effective, 100 percent safe. But they‚Äôre not,‚Äù Johnson said on Monday. ‚ÄúWe now know that fully vaccinated individuals can catch COVID, they can transmit COVID. So what‚Äôs the point?‚Äù After playing a clip of Johnson‚Äôs interview, Harlow asked Reiner, who advised the White House medical team under President George W. Bush, what he thought of those comments. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd say that he‚Äôs so misguided that it makes me wonder whether this is all just an act. And if it is an act, what does that say about what he thinks his constituents want to hear?‚Äù Reiner said, later adding. ‚ÄúAnd if this is not an act, then he is just the most ignorant man in the United States Senate. And that says a lot.‚Äù Johnson has been making headlines with what some have considered to be outrageous claims throughout the course of the pandemic, causing many health experts to label him as one of the main perpetrators of misinformation happening in our country. And that‚Äôs something that Reiner says has consequences. ‚ÄúHis propagation of this nonsense that somehow vaccines don‚Äôt work and are unsafe is the reason why so many of his constituents are becoming hospitalized and are dying,‚Äù Reiner said. Erin Burnett Out Front¬†airs weeknights at 7 p.m. on CNN. Watch what Dr. Fauci had to say about possible vaccine mandates for domestic air travel: Dr. Anthony Fauci appeared on CNN‚Äôs The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer Monday, one day after turning some heads with his comments on vaccine mandates for air travel, while he was a guest on ABC News‚Äô This Week.
ABC‚Äôs Jonathan Karl asked Fauci if he agreed with President Biden that there shouldn't be a vaccine requirement for domestic air travel.
‚ÄúWell, it depends on what you want to use it for,‚Äù Fauci said. ‚ÄúA vaccine requirement for a person getting on the plane is just another level of getting people to have a mechanism that would spur them to get vaccinated; namely, you can't get on a plane unless you're vaccinated, which is just another one of the ways of getting requirements, whatever that might be. So I mean, anything that could get people more vaccinated would be welcome.‚Äù
On CNN Monday, Fauci had a chance to elaborate further when fill-in host Jim Acosta asked him about those and similar comments he has made recently on the subject.
‚ÄúWhat I said, Jim, was that everything that comes up as a possibility, we put it on the table and we consider it. That does not mean that it is going to be likely to happen,‚Äù Fauci said. ‚ÄúRight now, I don‚Äôt think people should expect that we‚Äôre going to have a requirement in domestic flights for people to be vaccinated. When I was asked that question, I gave an honest answer. It‚Äôs on the table, and we consider it, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs going to happen.‚Äù
Fauci, who is the chief White House medical advisor, went on to say that things would have to change dramatically for vaccine mandates to be seriously considered for domestic air travel. But when he was pressed further about how his stance on the issue compares to others in the White House, Fauci said it‚Äôs not about having a stance.
‚ÄúLet's clarify that, Jim. I said that is something that‚Äôs open for consideration. It‚Äôs not a question of being in favor of it or not. I‚Äôm in favor of what we can do to keep the country safe,‚Äù Fauci said. ‚ÄúIf the situation arise where that‚Äôs something we think should be important to do, we‚Äôll do it. Right now, that‚Äôs not going to be done. But we never take anything off the table. We always keep things open for consideration.‚Äù Tell us what you think!

12/31/2021,"Prosecutors dropped a case against two jail guards accused of sleeping on the job as Epstein died. They made the decision on December 13, in the middle of Ghislaine Maxwell's trial. The decision to drop the indictment against the guards wasn't made public until December 30. In the middle of Ghislaine Maxwell's child-sex-trafficking trial, federal prosecutors quietly dropped their case against two jail guards accused of sleeping on the job and falsifying jail records as Jeffrey Epstein killed himself in his cell. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan signed a nolle prosequi, a document announcing to the judge that they wished to drop the case, on December 13. The document didn't appear on the court's public docket until Thursday, one day after Maxwell was convicted on charges that she trafficked girls to Epstein for sex and participated in sexual abuse herself. Prosecutors first filed charges against the guards, Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, in November 2019. Prosecutors said the guards napped, caught up on the news, and shopped for motorcycles and furniture instead of doing their rounds at the Metropolitan Correctional Center. Epstein was held at the federal jail while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking and sexual-abuse charges. Epstein was found dead in his cell on the morning of August 10, 2019, and New York City's head coroner ruled it a suicide. Epstein's brother, Mark Epstein, hired his own coroner who said the financier's broken neck bones were more consistent with a homicide. Noel and Thomas pleaded not guilty to the charges against them for falsifying records. In May this year, they entered a deferred prosecution agreement where prosecutors agreed not to bring the guards' case to trial until after they finished cooperating with an investigation into the circumstances of Epstein's death with the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General. The OIG has yet to release a report in connection with the investigation. A public status conference for the case against Noel and Thomas had been scheduled for December 16, but it was canceled on December 15 without explanation or scheduling of a future meeting. The December 13 nolle prosequi said Noel and Thomas satisfactorily complied with the terms of the non-prosecution agreement and completed community service. It's unclear why the document wasn't made public until December 30. While she was prosecuted in Manhattan, Maxwell has been kept in a federal jail in Brooklyn. The Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan was closed in September, after years of accusations that the building was in poor condition and had been poorly managed, and that its guards were overworked. Representatives for the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, which oversaw the Epstein, Maxwell, Noel, and Thomas cases, declined to comment for this story. Law and Crime obtained statements from attorneys representing Noel and Thomas that celebrated the decision to scuttle the case against them. ""Securing a resolution that eliminates both imprisonment and a criminal conviction is the favorable outcome that Ms. Noel prayed for since her arrest,"" said Jason Foy, Noel's attorney.

12/31/2021,"One thing that‚Äôs hard to grasp about the climate crisis is that big changes can happen fast. In 2019, I was aboard the Nathaniel B. Palmer, a 308-foot-long scientific research vessel, cruising in front of the Thwaites Glacier in Antarctica. One day, we were sailing in clear seas in front of the glacier. The next day, we were surrounded by icebergs the size of aircraft carriers. As we later learned from satellite images, in a matter of 48 hours or so, a m√©lange of ice about 21 miles wide and 15 miles deep had cracked up and scattered into the sea. More from Rolling Stone COP26 Agreement Is 'Not Enough' to Stave Off Global Climate Disaster, UN Chief Says Democrats Are Coming After Big Oil Over the Industry's Endless Climate Bullshit Report: Plastic May Soon Overtake Coal as a Climate Killer It was a spooky moment. Thwaites Glacier is the size of Florida. It is the cork in the bottle of the entire West Antarctic ice sheet, which contains enough ice to raise sea levels by 10 feet. The m√©lange that disintegrated was not part of the glacier itself, but a mix of icebergs and sea ice that had cozied up next to it. Still, the idea that it could just fall apart overnight was mind-blowing. Alex Mazur As it turns out, the ice breakup I witnessed was not a freak event. A few weeks ago, scientists participating in the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration, a $25 million five-year-long joint research program between the National Science Foundation in the U.S. and the Natural Environment Research Council in the U.K., presented their latest research. They described the discovery of cracks and fissures in the Thwaites eastern ice shelf, predicting that the ice shelf could fracture like a shattered car window in as little as five years. ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt scatter out into sea as quickly as what you saw when you were down there,‚Äù Erin Pettit, a glaciologist at Oregon State University and one of the lead principal investigators in the ITGC, later told me. ‚ÄúBut the basic process is the same. The ice shelf is breaking up and could be gone in less than a decade.‚Äù Given the ongoing war for American democracy and the deadly toll of the Covid pandemic, the loss of an ice shelf on a far-away continent populated by penguins might not seem to be big news. But in fact, the West Antarctic ice sheet is one of the most important tipping points in the Earth‚Äôs climate system. If Thwaites Glacier collapses, it opens the door for the rest of the West Antarctic ice sheet to slide into the sea. Globally, 250 million people live within three feet of high tide lines. Ten feet of sea level rise would be a world-bending catastrophe. It‚Äôs not only goodbye Miami, but goodbye to virtually every low-lying coastal city in the world. But predicting the breakup of ice sheets and the implications for future sea level rise is fraught with uncertainty. Depending on various emissions scenarios in the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, we could have as little as one foot of sea level rise by the end of the century, or nearly six feet of sea level rise (of course, rising seas won‚Äôt stop in 2100, but that date has become a common benchmark). ‚ÄúThe difference between those [models] is a lot of lives and money,‚Äù says Richard Alley, a glaciologist at Penn State University and one of the great ice scientists of our time. Alley adds: ‚ÄúThe most likely place to generate [the worst scenario] is Thwaites.‚Äù Or to put it more urgently: ‚ÄúIf there is going to be a climate catastrophe,‚Äù Ohio State glaciologist Ian Howat once told me, ‚Äúit‚Äôs probably going to start at Thwaites.‚Äù The problem is, understanding what‚Äôs going on at Thwaites is fiendishly complex. As I wrote in 2017: The trouble with Thwaites, which is one of the largest glaciers on the planet, is that it‚Äôs also what scientists call ‚Äúa threshold system.‚Äù That means instead of melting slowly like an ice cube on a summer day, it is more like a house of cards: It‚Äôs stable until it is pushed too far, then it collapses. Thwaites is very different from other big glaciers, such as those in Greenland. For one thing, it is not melting from above, due to warmer air temperatures. It‚Äôs melting from below, due to warmer ocean water eating away at its underbelly. More importantly, the terrain beneath the West Antarctic ice sheet is peculiar. ‚ÄúThink of it as a giant soup bowl filled with ice,‚Äù Sridhar Anandakrishnan, an expert in polar glaciology at Penn State University, once told me. In the bowl analogy, the edge of the glacier ‚Äî the spot where a glacier leaves the land and begins to float ‚Äî is perched on the lip of the bowl 1,000 feet or more below sea level. Scientists call that lip the ‚Äúgrounding line.‚Äù Below the lip, the terrain falls away on a downward slope for hundreds of miles, all the way to the Transantarctic Mountains that divide East and West Antarctica. At the deepest part of the basin, the ice is about two miles thick. What this means is that once the warm water gets below ice, it can flow down the slope of the bowl, weakening the ice from below. Through a mechanism called ‚Äúmarine ice-cliff Instability,‚Äù you can get what amounts to a runaway collapse of the ice sheet that could raise global sea levels very high, very fast. That‚Äôs why, when I wrote my 2017 Rolling Stone story about Thwaites, I dubbed it ‚ÄúThe Doomsday Glacier.‚Äù (The name stuck ‚Äî if you type the phrase into Google now, you get half a million hits.) In a worst-case scenario, how fast could Thwaites collapse? No one knows. The IPCC data is the best guide for sea level rise for the rest of this century, although Alley cautions me that even six feet of sea level rise by 2100 is not the worst-case scenario. ‚ÄúWe just don‚Äôt know what the upper boundary is for how fast this can happen,‚Äù Alley says. ‚ÄúWe are dealing with an event that no human has ever witnessed before. We have no analog for this.‚Äù In the past few years, scientists have made a lot of progress in understanding the dynamics of Thwaites. On our 2019 cruise, scientists discovered troughs in the seabed that allowed warm water to flow underneath the ice shelf. Scientists have mapped the underside of the glacier itself, tracked crevasses in the ice shelf, and located pinning points that might slow the retreat of the ice. The change has been dramatic: ‚ÄúThe net rate of ice loss from Thwaites Glacier is more than six times what it was in the early 1990s,‚Äù says Rob Larter, a geophysicist with the British Antarctic Survey who was the chief scientist on my trip to Antarctica in 2019. The recent news about Thwaites‚Äô eastern ice shelf breaking up in the next five years was not really a surprise to anyone who has been tracking the science closely. After the sudden disintegration of the Larsen B ice shelf in 2002, scientists realized that Antarctica was far less stable than many had believed. The discovery of cracks and fissures at Thwaites further underscore just how dynamic the changes already underway are. Erin Pettit To be clear, there is a big difference between an ice shelf and the glacier itself. The ice shelf is like a thumbnail that grows out from the glacier and floats on the ocean. Because it is already floating, when it melts it doesn‚Äôt in itself contribute to sea level rise (just as when ice cubes melt in your glass, they don‚Äôt raise the level of liquid). But ice shelves are important because they buttress glaciers. Like the flying buttresses of Notre Dame, they give the walls of ice stability. And when they break up, the land-based glacier is free to flow much faster into the sea. And that does raise sea levels. So yeah, if Thwaites loses a significant part of its ice shelf in five years, that‚Äôs a big deal. But even if a big part of the ice shelf does crack up, there is a lot of unknown complexity in how it will play out. ‚ÄúA first question is, if the ice-shelf breakage continues, will the whole ice shelf be lost, or will a short ice shelf remain, at least in some places?‚Äù Richard Alley emailed me. ‚ÄúAlmost all ice-shelf ice is buttressing, generating friction that holds back the non-floating ice, so loss of part, most or all of the ice shelf will increase flow of non-floating ice into the ocean. But the most-important buttressing tends to arise closest to the grounding zone, so if a short ice shelf does remain, it may still provide important buttressing, and the speedup of flow and thinning will be smaller than they could be with full ice-shelf loss.‚Äù Here you see the problem. Even predicting how the crackup of the ice shelf will impact the flow of the glacier is difficult to estimate. And this is only one of the uncertainties that scientists face when trying to predict whether or not Miami will be underwater by 2100. There is further uncertainty in exactly where and when the ice will fracture, how much warm water will be pushed up beneath the glacier by changing winds and ocean currents, how the character of the bed the glacier rests on will speed up or slow down the glacier‚Äôs slide into the sea. Whether the bed is hard rock or muddy till can have a big impact on the velocity of the glacier, just as the texture of snow affects how fast you ski down a mountain. ‚ÄúIce is alive,‚Äù says Pettit. ‚ÄúIt moves and flows and breaks in ways that are difficult to anticipate.‚Äù Paradoxically, the more scientists learn about what‚Äôs going on at Thwaites, the more divergent the latest climate models have become about its future. Consider the results of two models by highly respected scientists published side by side in Nature earlier this year. One model suggests that Thwaites stays fairly stable until temperatures rise above 2 C of warming. Then all hell breaks loose. Thwaites begins to fall into the sea like a line of dominoes pushed off a table and soon takes the rest of the West Antarctic ice sheet with it. And once the collapse begins, according to this model, it will be impossible to stop ‚Äî at least on any human time scale. In a century or so, global sea levels could rise 10 feet, which would swamp South Florida and Bangladesh and many other low-lying regions of the world. In the other model, global sea level rise only differs by 4¬Ω inches between a 1.5 C global temperature rise and a 3 C temperature rise (which is a little above where we are headed with under current emissions scenarios). And much of that comes from increased melt in Greenland and mountain glaciers. As for Antarctica, the paper says explicitly: ‚ÄúNo clear dependence on emissions scenario emerges for Antarctica.‚Äù So what to make of all this? ‚ÄúThe current divergence among model predictions is actually a good sign because it means that scientists are probing different parameterizations, representations of processes, and hypotheses,‚Äù writes Jeremy Bassis, a geophysicist at the University of Michigan. Bassis suggests not focusing so much on the long-term uncertainty and highlighting instead what scientists know about the next few decades. ‚ÄúThe skill of models in predicting sea level change on decadal time scales is high, and we already have actionable projections on these time scales. We should be emphasizing that fact in discussions with community members, stakeholders, and decision-makers, so they can move ahead with important adaptation and mitigation planning.‚Äù But in the long run, it is not clear that the dynamics of ice sheet collapse that are underway at Thwaites can be stopped. As glaciologist Eric Rignot put it in 2015, in Antarctica, ‚Äúthe fuse has been blown.‚Äù Even if we cut carbon emissions to zero tomorrow, warm water will continue to flow beneath the ice sheet for decades, destabilizing the ice and further pushing the glacier toward eventual collapse. This doesn‚Äôt means that cutting carbon pollution to zero isn‚Äôt an important goal ‚Äî nothing, in fact, is more important or more urgent. ‚ÄúWe may have a small safety margin in Antarctica, but not a large one,‚Äù says Alley. Even if the fuse is blown, cutting emissions fast could slow it all down to a millennium-long crack-up that will give us more time to adapt. One way or another, our future is written in ice.

They said they had responded to ‚Äúa disturbance call involving an unruly passenger.‚Äù¬† ‚ÄúWhen the aircraft arrived at the gate, officers were able to meet with exiting passengers who advised that the suspect, Ms. Patricia Cornwall had caused a disturbance while in the air,‚Äù police wrote. ‚ÄúThis disturbance lead [sic] to the injury of fellow passengers and Delta employees.‚Äù From there, they handed her off to FBI agents.¬† Cornwall made her first appearance on Monday afternoon in federal court in Atlanta where she did not submit a plea nor was required to, CNN reports.

Flight cancellations are easing slightly, as airlines work to get frustrated passengers to their final destinations. NBC‚Äôs Steve Patterson reports for TODAY from Los Angeles International Airport. In the federal complaint, investigators said they interviewed the victim, a male passenger, and watched a cellphone video of the incident which they say corroborated his story. That passenger alleged that Cornwall was told by a flight attendant to take a spare seat after using the restroom so the attendant could complete beverage service. Cornwall then allegedly asked the flight attendant, 'What am I, Rosa Parks?'""¬† Rosa Parks was a civil rights activist who refused to surrender her bus seat to a white passenger in 1955 in then-segregated Alabama. The alleged victim told the FBI that he then ""told Cornwall it was an inappropriate comment and that she 'isn't Black....this isn't Alabama and this isn't a bus,'"" according to the complaint. The man also told Cornwall to ""sit down Karen,"" according to the complaint. The pair then got into a dispute, which also involved masks, according to purported video of the event posted by ATL Uncensored. In it, a woman yells at an older man, who has a bottle of water in his hand, to pull up his mask as she is standing in the aisle with her mask down. In that video, a woman can be seen striking the male passenger before making a closed fist.

12/31/2021,"BEIRUT (AP) ‚Äî Satellite images taken this week over the Syrian port of Latakia show the smoldering wreckage after a reported Israeli missile strike, hours after firefighters contained a massive blaze. The raid launched from the Mediterranean Sea Tuesday was among the biggest launched by Israel into Syria, igniting a fire in the container terminal that raged for hours and caused significant material damage in the vicinity. It damaged a nearby hospital and offices, and also shattered windows of residential buildings and cars parked in the area near the port. The explosion could be heard miles away. It was the second such attack on the facility this month. The Latakia seaport handles most of the imports to Syria, a country ravaged by a decade-old civil war and Western-imposed sanctions. Another attack took place Dec. 7, when Syrian media reported Israeli warplanes hit the container terminal, also igniting a major fire. Satellite photos obtained by The Associated Press from Planet Labs PBC Thursday showed heavy smog over the container terminal on Wednesday, likely from the struck container still smoking. The images suggest it was a high precision strike that appeared to hit one container. A Syrian military official said the Israeli missiles were fired from the sea, west of Latakia, hitting the terminal and igniting fires. Maj. Mohannad Jafaar, head of the Latakia fire department, said 12 fire trucks worked for hours to contain the blaze. He said the containers that were hit held spare auto parts and oil but there were no casualties. The Israeli military, which rarely comments on individual attacks or discusses details of such operations, declined to comment on the reported strike. Israel says it targets bases of Iran-allied militias, such as Lebanon‚Äôs militant Hezbollah group, which has fighters in Syria. It says it attacks arms shipments believed to be bound for the militias.",World/Associated Press,Satellite images show smoldering wreckage at Syria port,https://news.yahoo.com/satellite-images-show-smoldering-wreckage-112453256.html
12/31/2021,"Jana Tobias was eager to suit up in a completely different way. The veteran, who served in the Army as a Black Hawk pilot, is one of 12 women who swapped their uniforms and combat boots for ‚Äò40s style dresses and high heels, for the 16th annual Pin-Ups for Vets 2022 calendar. The award-winning nonprofit, founded in 2006 by California resident Gina Elise, raises funding to support hospitalized and deployed troops. ""I try to follow as many veteran organizations as possible,"" Tobias told Fox News. ""I came across Pin-Ups for Vets on Facebook and I was just intrigued. I‚Äôve always loved the 1940s, not because of the clothes, but really the nose art. I‚Äôm in aviation, so that has always fascinated me. It was also a time when our country was going through hardship and war. And yet, we as Americans did whatever was possible to motivate and uplift our troops, so they can keep going. I felt like I could contribute."" The 44-year-old‚Äôs journey is one made fit for the silver screen. As a child, she was enamored with G.I. Joe and the 1984 action film ""Red Dawn,"" about how a group of teenagers band together to defend their country from invading Soviet forces. PIN-UPS FOR VETS PUTS A SPOTLIGHT ON FEMALE VETERANS POSING AS BOMBSHELLS TO RAISE MONEY FOR AMERICAN HEROES ""I grew up with four brothers,"" she chuckled. ""My father always treated me like one of the boys. He didn‚Äôt treat me special because I was a girl. He taught me everything, including fishing, camping, hiking ‚Äì whatever else my brothers were doing. We also wrestled. I felt like I could do anything that my brothers could do. My father also served at the National Guard so service was essential in my family."" According to the Massachusetts resident, it was in college when she saw a flyer for the ROTC at her dorm cafeteria. ""It was something I‚Äôve always wanted to do,"" said Tobias. ""I wanted to help people, save people. And I felt it would be very cool."" The choice forever changed her life. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER Tobias joined the Santa Barbara ROTC at the University of California during her freshman year in 1995. She was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant through the ROTC when she graduated in June 1999. According to Tobias, she served in South Korea from 2000 until 2001. From there she headed to Fort Hood from 2001 until 2008. Then came the Texas Army National Guard from 2009 until 2015, and finally the Massachusetts Army National Guard from 2016 until 2020. Tobias was deployed twice to Iraq; once with the 1st Cavalry Division on active duty from 2004 until 2005 and then with the 36th Infantry Division in the Texas Army National Guard from 2010 until 2011. Tobias said one of her most memorable experiences was being involved with the disaster relief and rescue operations during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. She described landing on overpasses, streets, stadiums and rooftops to help those stranded by rising waters. ""We all just came together from all different services to help civilians,"" she recalled. ""We got people from dark buildings that had no electricity. It was really hard to hold it together at times because you‚Äôre helping people who have lost everything. I remember one woman who was diabetic and I had to send my crew down a dark stairwell with the waters rising. I remember one family was waving at us from a rooftop in need of help. We were so grateful to be of aid, but it was just a humbling experience for all of us. Mother nature can take away everything in a heartbeat."" ""But I love flying helicopters,"" she continued. ""And it felt good to stand united and help others."" Over the years, Tobias said she followed several veteran organizations on social media. And along the way, she discovered Pin-Ups for Vets. ""The style was intriguing,"" she said. ""But also, I was just really drawn to the organization‚Äôs mission and what they were trying to accomplish by supporting our veterans. It felt like the perfect way for me to serve again. I reached out because I have done my own little pinup photos for my husband in these cool outfits and thought, ‚ÄòI could do this.'"" The nonprofit famously produces WWII-inspired bombshell calendars featuring veterans as models. The 16th annual calendar for 2022 features 12 female veterans, whose combined military service equals 100 years. '40S PINUP BETTY GRABLE WAS PROUD OF 'BRINGING A LITTLE HAPPINESS TO OUR SOLDIERS' DURING WWII, DAUGHTER SAYS Since its launch, Pin-Ups for Vets has donated over $80,000 to help hospitals purchase new rehabilitation equipment and to provide financial assistance for veterans‚Äô health care program expansion across the country. During the pandemic, Pin-Ups for Vets has been shipping out care packages enclosed with gifts of appreciation to hospitalized veterans. It continues to mail morale-boosting care packages to deployed U.S. troops around the globe. Tobias is Miss June 2022. ""I‚Äôm not a model, so this was outside my comfort zone,"" said Tobias. ""But my husband was there and making me laugh. It was a lot of fun. I met so many amazing women with inspirational stories from their time in the military. And when I saw the photos, I just couldn‚Äôt believe it was me. Gina has this eye and I felt so beautiful. I still can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs me."" And the cause hit close to home. Tobias said that like many veterans, she faced personal struggles. ‚ÄòFORREST GUMP‚Äô STAR GARY SINISE SAYS HE‚ÄôS DEDICATED TO HONORING WOUNDED VETERANS: ‚ÄòWE CAN NEVER DO ENOUGH‚Äô ""My biggest struggle was knowing who I was and how I fit in,"" she admitted. ""I was an officer, I was a leader. I was in charge of platoons and companies. Those were all skills I learned to develop‚Ä¶ Some people might think veterans just follow commands because that‚Äôs the perception of the military. You‚Äôre just a soldier. You don‚Äôt ask questions. But you have your integrity, your moral compass. We‚Äôre not just robots. We have goals and dreams like anyone else."" ""Even a simple thank-you makes me feel appreciative,"" she continued. ""When I was younger, I just couldn‚Äôt understand how our vets could be treated so poorly after they saw hardships. You want to feel that you matter from the people you love. You want to feel appreciated and not alone. When a soldier feels appreciated, they can do their job so much better. The feeling of being alone and not understood is so detrimental to someone‚Äôs mental health, no matter what you do. But especially serving, the things we are required to do are difficult. So the more support that we have, the stronger our soldiers can be‚Ä¶ and horrible tragedies will be less likely to happen."" Looking back at her experience with Pin-Ups for Vets, Tobias said she‚Äôs a proud American and is looking forward to what our country can accomplish in the New Year. ""I am proud of our resilience,"" she said. ""I am proud that we can live in a place where we aren‚Äôt persecuted daily. I don‚Äôt know if many people realize that. You don‚Äôt have to look over your shoulder constantly. We have our freedoms. I‚Äôm happy where we are as a nation because it‚Äôs far better than it could be. We always fight and we never give up.

12/31/2021,"‚ö°Ô∏è Read the full article on Motorious Dead from injuries sustained in a car crash after the close of WWII, General George S. Patton, Jr. left in his wake a tremendous legacy. While some have mourned what was a tragic loss at the time, others over the decades have theorized Patton‚Äôs death was anything but an accident. Learn about Henry Ford‚Äôs bizarre social program here. Known for his aggressive nature just as much as his many battlefield victories, General George S. Patton was like a giant among men. He was one of the few allied generals who had combat experience commanding tanks during WWI, making him invaluable during the North Africa campaign. Later, he embarrassed many of his peers in Sicily, Italy by winning the race to Messina against the British Eighth Army. In what might seem a little too coincidental, Patton was exposed for allegedly slapping and dressing down soldiers in a field hospital since they claimed to be suffering from battle fatigue. The press wanted Patton‚Äôs blood and they were able to get some worked up enough to call for him to be relieved of duty. However, General Dwight D. Eisenhower and General George C. Marshall stepped in, likely realizing Patton was too valuable to the war effort. After spending some time in England, Patton was key to Operation FORTITUDE, the ruse invasion staged in Pas-de-Calais, France. German commanders were so fearful of Patton‚Äôs abilities and so convinced he was leading the real invasion that they maintained troops in Pas-de-Calais even after D-Day. One of Patton‚Äôs most famous act of heroics was during the Battle of the Bulge when he led parts of the U.S. Third Army in a counterattack, saving the hopelessly besieged 101st Airborne Division. This endeared him even more to soldiers and the public in general. On December 9, 1945, Patton was still stationed in Germany when he accepted an invitation from his chief of staff, Major General Hobart Gay, to go pheasant hunting near the base. Originally, Patton was sitting in the front seat of the Cadillac which was being driven by Private H.L. Woodring, his favorite chauffeur. However, when the general noticed the hunting guide‚Äôs dog was riding in an open-top jeep, he asked for the party to pull over and had the dog sit in the front of the car so it could warm up. Patton moved to the backseat. Sadly, the good deed would not go unpunished. While traveling over a railroad crossing, the Cadillac collided with the passenger side of a U.S. Army truck which was turning left. Some claim the limousine Patton was riding in was traveling at a relatively low speed. Others say Private Woodring was going too fast for conditions. During the accident, Patton struck his head on the glass partition in front of him. That impact resulted in a compression fracture and dislocation of the cervical third and fourth vertebrae as well as cervical spinal cord injury. He was paralyzed from the neck down. A mere 12 days later, on December 21, one of the greatest generals the United States Army has ever known passed away from his injuries. Fueling speculation that the accident with the U.S. Army truck was in truth not an accident but instead was a coordinated assassination was the fact Patton rubbed Russian officers the wrong way in many social and diplomatic relations. He also had been talking about the prospects of invading Russia, saying they were obviously inferior to Americans and would fold in no time. Many in the upper ranks of the U.S. Military didn‚Äôt like such a proposition, a feeling which was shared by much of Washington, D.C. and other powers that be of the time. Some believe it was Stalin who had Patton killed because he feared the man could pull off an invasion successfully. Others claim it was the CIA, others in the US government, actors in the British government, or even Allied leaders working with Stalin to get rid of Patton. Patton also was vocal in post-war Germany about the denazification process and other moves with the government. Eisenhower removed him as the U.S. commander in Bavaria for the politically unwise statements and was transferred to the 15th Army Group, his final post. The only four star general to be buried at an American Battle Monuments Commission cemetery, Patton was laid to rest alongside his men at Luxembourg American Cemetery, per his request. Just like in his life, in death the general was a man of the people. Beloved by his soldiers and a good portion of the public, it‚Äôs entirely possible others saw him as too big of a threat, especially since there was no longer a worldwide war to be fought.
