3/23/2022,"Ian Shepherdson, chief economist and founder of research consulting firm Pantheon Macroeconomics, is predicting a dramatic fall in the pace of home sales this year. In a research note, he projected that existing-home sales will drop roughly 25% from the annual pace of 6.02 million set in February to a rate of 4.5 million by the end of summer. “The housing market is in the early stages of a substantial downshift in activity, which will trigger a steep decline in the rate of increase of home prices, starting perhaps as soon as the spring,” Shepherdson wrote in a research note distributed Sunday.",Business/MarketWatch•yesterday,"‘The housing market is in the early stages of a substantial downshift’: Home sales may drop 25% by the end of summer, according to this analyst",https://finance.yahoo.com/m/e8fd7ce1-50e9-3707-b1d0-ffc9ab393630/%E2%80%98the-housing-market-is-in-the.html
3/23/2022,"undefinedundefined Can You Retire With $600,000? It's possible to retire with $600,000 in savings with careful planning, but it's important to consider how long your money will last. Whether you can successfully retire with $600,000 can depend on a number of factors, including: Your desired retirement age Estimated retirement budget Expected longevity Total savings and income The earlier you retire, the longer your retirement savings has to last, especially if you have a longer life expectancy. And the type of lifestyle you choose can influence how far $600,000 will go in retirement. Things like inflation and market volatility can also affect your overall retirement outcomes. Health can play a part as well as healthcare costs tend to increase as you get older. Can I Retire at 62 With $600,000? Retiring at 62 may be your goal, but can you do it with $600,000 in savings? If you plan to downsize your home, live a minimalist lifestyle and supplement your retirement savings with a pension plan, annuity or Social Security benefits then the answer may be yes. On the other hand, retiring at 62 with $600,000 may not be realistic if you plan to spend more to fund your lifestyle or you don't have alternative sources of income other than savings. While Social Security benefits can provide income, taking those benefits at 62 will reduce the amount you receive. You'll need to wait until full retirement age, typically 66 or 67, to get your full benefit amount. And you can increase your benefits if you're able to hold out until age 70. It's also important to consider overall health and how that can impact your retirement plans. If you manage to stay healthy and never need long-term care then $600,000 could be enough to sustain you in retirement. On the other hand, if you need long-term care in a nursing facility that could take a large bite out of your savings. Medicare doesn't cover extended nursing home care. Medicaid can but you may need to spend down the majority of your assets first to qualify. Setting up a Medicaid asset protection trust can allow you to get around this requirement, which may be something worth discussing with a financial advisor. How Long Will $600,000 Last in Retirement? undefined So let's apply that to a real-life example. Say that you plan to retire at 62 with $600,000 saved. You expect to withdraw 4% each year, starting with a $24,000 withdrawal in Year One. Your money earns a 5% annual rate of return while inflation stays at 2.9%. Based on those numbers, $600,000 would be enough to last you 30 years in retirement. In fact, by age 92 you'd still have over $116,000 in savings. Now, assume that inflation increases to 4%. In that scenario, you'd run out of money by age 90. This is important to understand because rising prices can reduce your purchasing power over time. This is where it becomes helpful to consider other sources of income for retirement, such as Social Security benefits or a pension if you have one. Again, Social Security benefits can begin as early as age 62, but you'll get a lower amount than you would if you waited until full retirement age. But if you're retiring with $600,000 in savings, taking benefits earlier could make sense if you're worried about running out of money based on your anticipated life expectancy. Using a Social Security retirement calculator can help you get a better idea of how much money you're likely to receive. How to Retire With $600,000 If you're interested in retiring with $600,000 in savings, planning early is important. You'll need to consider what age you plan to retire, what kind of lifestyle you anticipate having in retirement and what your total savings and income picture will look like. That includes planning for future income needs for your spouse as well if you're married. The earlier you begin saving, the easier it may be to reach your $600,000 goal. So if you have a 401(k) at work, for instance, you may want to focus on maxing that account out first. At the very least, it's important to save enough to qualify for the full employer match if there is one. If you don't have a 401(k), you can still save in an Individual Retirement Account. A traditional IRA can offer tax-deductible contributions, with taxes on earnings deferred until you retire. A Roth IRA offers no deduction but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. A SEP or SIMPLE IRA could make sense if you're self-employed. These accounts have higher annual contribution limits than traditional or Roth IRAs, so you can save more for the future. In terms of how withdrawals are taxed, they follow the same tax rules as traditional IRAs. You may also consider creating an additional stream of income for yourself with an annuity. An annuity is an insurance contract in which you pay a premium in exchange for receiving payments back later. There are different types of annuity products to choose from but they can all create guaranteed income. If you're married, you may be able to carry those benefits over to your spouse when you pass away. Talking to a financial advisor a can help you decide if an annuity might be right for you. Your advisor can also discuss other strategies that can help you reach your goal of saving $600,000 for retirement. For example, they can offer advice on how to best allocate your assets to generate your desired returns, both before and during retirement. They can also help you choose investments for maximum tax and cost-efficiency. The Bottom Line Retirement Planning Tips Consider talking to a financial advisor about what retiring on $600,000 might look like for you and whether that's something that's doable. Finding a qualified financial advisor doesn't have to be hard. SmartAsset's free tool matches you with up to three financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you. If you're ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now. Use SmartAsset's no-cost retirement calculator so get a good idea of the progress you're making in building a retirement nest egg. In addition to tax-advantaged accounts, such as a 401(k) or IRA, you might also consider opening a taxable brokerage account. A brokerage account can offer more flexibility in terms of the types of securities you can trade. This can help increase diversification and give you an additional source of savings. And many brokerages now offer $0 commission fee trading, which can save you money.

3/23/2022,"While most people are focused on the escalating price at the pump, two gas stations in Wisconsin are suing a competitor that they say is selling gas too cheap. A Shell and BP gas station in Waukesha, Wis., have filed suit against a local grocery chain, Woodman’s, saying the company has illegally outpriced them, and violated the state’s Unfair Sales Act, which prohibits companies from selling goods below cost. They’re seeking damages of $80,000 each. As of Monday morning, Google Maps shows Woodman’s selling gas at $3.60 per gallon, while the Shell and BP locations are charging $3.86 and $3.80 per gallon, respectively. Woodman’s says it is allowed to sell prices at that rate, due to an exemption from the Unfair Sales Act, requiring the company to notify the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection of the price drop, which allows them to match a competitor’s prices. That competitor would be Costco, which is located about 6.5 miles from the grocer. Nationwide, the average gallon of gas is selling for $4.25, according to AAA on Monday. Wisconsin’s average is $3.91, and Waukesha County averages $3.88. On average, the national price per gallon has jumped roughly 75 cents in the past month, largely in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent disruption of the global oil market. While it has eased up some in recent days, many experts say they still expect gas to top $5 per gallon before the conflict is over—and $6 has also been suggested as a real possibility.

3/23/2022,"By Julie Ingwersen and P.J. Huffstutter CHICAGO (Reuters) - After Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent global wheat futures soaring, U.S. farmer Vance Ehmke was eager to sell his grain. Local prices shot up roughly 30% to nearly $12 a bushel, about the highest Ehmke could recall in 45 years of farming near the western Kansas town of Healy. Instead of reaping a windfall, Ehmke found a commodities market turned upside down. He and his wife Louise told Reuters they couldn't sell a nickel of their upcoming summer wheat harvest for future delivery. Futures prices for corn and wheat had rocketed so abruptly that many along the complex chain of grain handling - local farm cooperatives, grain elevators, flour millers and exporters - stopped buying for fear they couldn't resell at a profit. Others couldn't afford an industry-wide risk-management strategy known as hedging that keeps global commodities markets moving. Missiles falling in Ukraine had rocked that system, sending middlemen scrambling to shore up positions in the futures market that were costing them millions of dollars per day. ""More than anything, the market is just in a panic,"" Andrew Jackson, a Kentucky grain merchandiser, told Reuters. Many of these players continue to hold back on purchases to see how the Eastern European conflict shakes out: Russia is the world's top wheat exporter and Ukraine is a major global supplier of both wheat and corn. While some North American millers have said they have enough grain on hand from past harvests to continue producing for several months, prolonged or repeated disruptions to grain trading could eventually contribute to already-inflated food prices. Meanwhile, the inability to sell some of their winter wheat - whose harvest starts in June - is putting the squeeze on U.S. farmers. Growers like the Ehmkes need cash now to pay for seed and fertilizer ahead of spring planting, as well as for land rent and tax bills coming due. Fertilizer bills alone are expected to jump 12% this year, after rising 17% last year, according to American Farm Bureau Federation and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) data. If American farmers decide to cut back, that could curb yields for the fall harvest at a time when the world may soon need more grain. Developing countries are particularly vulnerable to supply shortages and high grain prices, said Don Roose, president of agricultural broker U.S. Commodities in Iowa. ""Emerging markets like Africa could have less bread to eat,"" Roose said. SHORTS VS LONGS The unusual situation that throttled the Ehmkes stems from the system of hedging that U.S. grain growers and processors have long used to insure themselves against price swings. For every bushel of grain they commit to buy, purchasers sell an equal amount of bushels in the futures market as a hedge to protect themselves against losses. These commercial players are the traditional ""shorts,"" or sellers, in the futures market. On the other side are futures buyers, or ""longs."" These players typically are speculators such as hedge funds and investment banks not involved in the physical grain-handling business. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, which Moscow dubbed a ""special operation,"" speculators aggressively bought wheat and corn futures, especially the nearby May contracts. The price of May wheat on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) jumped 54% in just nine trading days, from $8.84-3/4 per bushel on Feb. 23 to $13.63-1/2 on March 8. Russia and Ukraine together supply about 26% of the world's wheat exports, according to the latest USDA data. Shipments through the Black Sea have already been disrupted. When futures shoot higher, commercial grain sellers accrue paper losses on their short positions. That's not necessarily a disaster, as the physical grain they have purchased is rising in value too. But until they can sell the grain and close their futures positions, they can get squeezed financially. In recent weeks, many have faced so-called margin calls from their futures brokers, forcing them to inject enormous sums into their commodity trading accounts to cover their losses. ""It's a massive headache that could turn into a problem if they do not have their financial house in order,"" said Chad Hart, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University. CALLING THE BANKER The wheat rally clobbered buyers of other crops, too. Landus Cooperative, the largest agriculture cooperative in Iowa, briefly suspended its cash bids to buy corn and soybeans on March 9. Chief Executive Matt Carstens said Landus also tripled its credit line with CoBank, a top U.S. agricultural lender, to cover hundreds of millions of dollars in margin calls during the rally and ensure its business remained healthy. CoBank has delivered more than $4.5 billion in loans and credit to customers to deal with margin calls and grain purchases in January and February alone, Eric Itambo, CoBank's chief banking officer, told Reuters. Though spot CBOT wheat futures have cooled in recent days, slipping back below $11 a bushel, the futures market has not been this volatile since 2008, when food shortages worldwide sparked riots in some countries. Back in Kansas, the Ehmkes are eyeing a worsening drought that is hurting the winter wheat crop currently in the ground. Still, they think they might get another chance to sell wheat at $12 or more with the Ukraine conflict showing no sign of abating. ""Just a whole bunch of things are telling us the price of wheat could be substantially higher than what it is right now,"" Vance Ehmke said. (Reporting by Julie Ingwersen in Chicago, and P.J.

3/23/2022,"Have the markets turned the corner? Maybe not – but maybe so, at least for the short term. Despite rising inflation in the States, and Russia’s continuing war against Ukraine, high prices for oil, and disruptions in the global commodity markets, Wall Street just finished its best week since November of 2020. Between March 14 and March 18, the S&P 500 rose ~6%, while the NASDAQ was up ~9%. Investors were clearly in a buying mood, and the indexes reflected it. However, some Wall Street pros are understandably concerned that the market is still vulnerable. In this environment, investors are going to gravitate toward stocks that have proven records of strong share price appreciation. While we all know that past performance won’t guarantee future results, the best place to start looking for tomorrow’s high-growth stocks is among yesterday’s winners. Using TipRanks’ database, we’ve found three ‘monster growth’ names that saw hefty gains over the past 12 months. Each name is well-loved by Wall Street analysts, and has received enough bullish calls to score a “Strong Buy” consensus rating. Golar LNG Limited (GLNG) We’ll start in the energy industry, where Golar LNG has exploited some economic quirks of the natural gas industry to become a leader in the liquified natural gas sector. The company specializes in the building and operation of floating natural gas liquefaction facilities, a niche that makes it possible to exploit previously non-economic gas reserves. Natural gas must be liquefied for safe long-distance transport, and Golar brings the liquefaction facilities to the gas fields – and can move those facilities when necessary. Golar boasts that its floating gas liquefaction fleet can operation at a lower cost than land-based facilities. High energy prices, and particularly rising prices for natural gas on the global market, has been good for Golar. The company has seen its share price rise 70% so far this year. A quick look at the company’s earnings will show the extent of the growth, and the potential. In 4Q21, Golar showed $93.5 million in EBITDA, up from $78 million in the year-ago quarter. Sequentially, the gain was higher; Q3’s result had been $74.5 million. BTIG analyst Gregory Lewis sees Golar in a strong position to gain additional business, writing: “We believe we are on the cusp of a multi-year run in LNG project FIDs (Final Investment Decision) as we expect natural gas to serve as a bridge fuel as the world shifts to renewable energy over the next few decades. And more importantly… Golar has a much improved capital structure (~$500M in current liquidity to go after its next flexible Floating LNG (FLNG) project which includes ~$250M in cash), an existing base of LNG assets which could be FLNG conversion projects, and FLNG solutions, which we think positions the company to win multiple FLNG projects over the next two years.” These comments support Lewis’s Buy rating, while his $30 price target on GLNG stock implies ~43% upside for the coming year. (To watch Lewis’ track record, click here) Overall, Golar’s Strong Buy analyst consensus rating is based on 8 recent stock reviews, that include 6 to Buy and 2 to Hold. The shares are priced at $21.02, and their $22.81 average price target indicates an 8.5% upside from that level. (See GLNG stock analysis on TipRanks) Matador Resources Company (MTDR) Sticking with the energy sector, we’ll turn our view to Matador Resources. This company engages in hydrocarbon exploration, development, and extraction, focusing on unconventional plays in the North American oil and natural gas industries. Matador has is primary operations in the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring plays the Texas-New Mexico Delaware Basin, with additional assets in Northwest Louisiana. Matador’s operations are generating cash as well as hydrocarbons. The company reported $334.5 million in cash from operations for 4Q21, up 15% from Q3, and an even stronger 112% year-over-year. This total included $119.3 million in adjusted free cash flow, nearly double the year-ago quarter’s $60.7 million. The steady growth in cash flow prompted Matador to increase its quarterly dividend this past fall, and to maintain the higher payment this month. The last dividend, paid out on March 14, was for 5 cents per common share. This annualizes to 20 cents, and gives a modest yield 0f 0.3%. The key point here is not the yield, but the combination of management’s statement of intent to increase the returns to shareholders along with the company’s strong cash flow generation. It’s important to note here that MTDR shares have gained 118% in the past 12 months. Neil Dingmann, 5-star analyst from Truist, writes of Matador: “We believe Matador has done a notable job of creating value in its ten year existence... By our estimates, the company continues to be set up for solid upcoming production/cash flow/stock price growth despite the strong share performance already seen in the past several months. We have high confidence of continued strong well performance in the ~70 wells to be turned to sales this year given the continued operational efficiencies/outperformance previously demonstrated.” Dingmann’s bullish stance comes with a Buy rating on the stock, while his $68 price target suggests Matador has room for ~29% upside growth by the end of this year. (To watch Dingmann’s track record, click here) There are seven recent reviews of Matador shares on record and they all agree that this is one to buy, making the Strong Buy consensus unanimous. The stock is selling for $52.81 and its $62 average price target implies ~17% one-year upside. (See MTDR stock analysis on TipRanks) Intra-Cellular Therapies (ITCI) Let’s shift gears now, and turn to the biopharmaceutical industry. Intra-Cellular Therapies is a clinical- and commercial-stage research company developing new treatments for mental health disorders in adults. This is a field with, in the jargon, ‘high unmet medical needs.’ Mental health diseases place a heavy burden on both patients and caregivers, and treatments currently available suffer from both poor success rates, high con-compliance rates with treatment, dangerous or undesirable side effects – or all of that combined. This gives Intra-Cellular an opening, if it can get a more effective drug to market. The company is on the cusp of that. In December of last year, the FDA approved ITCI’s leading product, lumateperone (branded as Caplyta) for the treatment of bi-polar depression in adults. This was an important label extension for Caplyta, which has already been approved in December of 2019 as a treatment for adult schizophrenia. Having a drug on the market is the Holy Grail for biopharma companies, and Intra-Cellular has seen a steady – and steadily increasing – revenue stream from Caplyta since its initial approval. In the last quarter reported, 4Q21, Intra-Cellular showed $25.7 million in top-line revenues. This was a 106% jump from the year-ago quarter, and marks the 7th straight quarter of revenue gains since Caplyta went on the market. Shares in ITCI reflect this revenue growth – the stock is up 70% since this time last year. The company is following up on its current success with lumateperone, and has additional clinical trials underway. The drug is being evaluated in a pair of Phase 3 double-blind placebo controlled studies as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder. In addition, Intra-Cellular has three other drug candidates in earlier-stage clinical trials, for conditions ranging from Alzheimer’s and dementia to Parkinson’s and opioid abuse. Covering ITCI for Jefferies, analyst Andrew Tsai writes: “In 2022, we think ITCI stock could break all-time highs despite a challenging tape, as Caplyta scripts are accelerating earlier (and perhaps even faster) than Street expectations… For SCZ/BPD, we can derive a valuation of $6-8B + (or $65-85/sh) by applying a 3-4x multiple to our above-cons $2B peak sales estimate, though this thinking is perhaps conservative and excludes the Phase II/III pipeline (which deserves credit). Bottom line, a healthy balance sheet (we est Q1 cash of $750M +), a strong narrative (clean story), and meaningful upside potential (SCZ/BPD plus pipeline optionality) drive scarcity value, leading us to think ITCI stock should continue outperforming this year.” In line with this upbeat outlook, Tsai rates the stock a Buy, and his $90 price target implies an upside of 47% this year. (To watch Tsai’s track record, click here) Tsai is hardly the only bull on this stock; ITCI has a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating supported by 9 analyst reviews. The average price target of $68.67 gives a 12% upside potential from the current share price of $61.05.

3/23/2022,"Stocks experienced a brutal correction in January before bouncing to end the month down roughly 5%. That may be just the start of the pain for passive “buy-and-hold” investors, according to Barry Bannister, the chief equity strategist at Stifel, a St. Louis–based investment bank. In fact, the strategist is predicting an entire decade of suffering ahead for markets as the Fed raises interest rates, with 0% returns for investors. ""Buy and hold is the ideal strategy in the bull phases…but in the down phases, being in the index is not going to generate a positive return. Investors who are passive are going to suffer,"" Bannister told Insider in an interview last week. Passive investors who often choose to hold indexes like the S&P 500, which tracks the 500 largest companies traded on U.S. exchanges, saw a compound annual rate of return of more than 13% over the past decade, but the market hasn’t always been so kind to its most patient players. Historically, 20-year total stock market returns have always been positive, but there have been multiple, decade-long periods when passive investors have lost money, Bannister explained. He argues that the past decade of passive management outperformance may be over, as four-decade-high inflation, rising geopolitical tensions, and increased regulatory pressure are set to eat away at real returns for stock investors. ""As long as the laws of supply and demand exist, we're going to have [supply-chain] disruptions, geopolitical rivalries, fiat currencies, indebted governments, populism, and [profit] margin and regulatory pressure,"" Bannister said. This isn’t the first time Bannister has made a “lost decade” prediction. He argued passive investors would struggle with a “lost decade” back in 2018 as well, telling CNBC that 2019 would likely be a recession year with a decade of sideways trading set to follow. He was wrong. Stocks have gone on quite the run since then, with the S&P 500 rising 31% in 2019, 18% in 2020, and 28% in 2021, adding credence to the theory that attempting to time market entries may not be the best choice. Bannister argued then, as he does now, that the Fed had pushed stocks into bubble territory by maintaining historically low-interest rates and injecting billions into the economy through quantitative easing (QE), a policy in which central banks purchase bonds in order to increase the money supply and encourage lending and investment. He suspected then there would be a price to pay after the Fed pulled the training wheels off the market. “Central banks front-loaded equity prices,” Bannister told CNBC in April 2018. “The ‘payback’ is now a long, flat decade ahead.” From 2018 to 2019, the Fed increased interest rates to nearly 2.5% after several rate hikes, and S&P 500 returns did turn negative in 2018. But at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 the Fed slashed rates to nearly zero, and equities responded with a strong run. Now, with the Fed beginning to raise rates again, and planning an additional six or more raises through 2022 along with an end to QE, Bannister is back on the lost decade bandwagon. But this time, he sees rising geopolitical rivalries and ongoing supply-chain disruptions being a bigger contributor to potential poor returns for stock investors—and he’s not alone. Analysts at Goldman Sachs also recently warned of the potential for a lost decade for passive investors, especially those who stick with historical allocations like the 60/40 portfolio. The classic 60/40 portfolio—which is named for its allocation split of 60% stocks and 40% high-grade debt—is down roughly 7% in 2022 as low interest rates and inflation have turned real bond yields negative. Since 2000, passive investors with a 60/40 allocation have experienced inflation-adjusted returns of around 7.5% annually, according to Morningstar, but that period of outperformance may come to an end—and it wouldn’t be the first time. During the “lost decade” of the 2000s, the 60/40 portfolio returned just 2.3% to investors annually, and lost value on an inflation-adjusted basis, according to what Goldman Sachs Asset Management’s Nick Cunningham wrote in October, Bloomberg reported. They made up for it in the next decade. To avoid the trap of passive investing in a bear market, Goldman analysts recommend investors focus on “real assets,” like raw materials, real estate, and infrastructure while increasing diversification. Analysts from the Investment firm KKR argue that investors might need to take more risk and be active participants in the market to earn strong real returns. “The current crisis makes forecasting risk parameters such as risk of loss, volatilities, and correlations only more challenging. This backdrop means that investors must take on more risk for the same expected return,” Henry McVey, KKR’s head of global macro, balance sheet, and risk, and Racim Allouani, a managing director, told Bloomberg.

3/23/2022,"Since the unilateral withdrawal of the US in May 2018 from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – the ‘nuclear deal’ – Iran’s level of crude oil production and exports has been severely constrained due to the resultant US-led sanctions against the Islamic Republic. However, this impediment to the full flow of Iranian crude back into the global oil markets is now only one step away from being removed. The US is poised to revoke the designation of ‘Foreign Terrorist Organisation’ (FTO) from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). This designation has long been a major obstacle to Iran agreeing a new JCPOA, and would in turn allow Tehran to finally commit to the rules and regulations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The lack of Iran’s adherence to the FATF has similarly been the last key sticking point for the US – and the other signatories to the original JCPOA (the U.K., France, China, and Russia) plus Germany – to ratify the new iteration of the Agreement. The signing of a new JCPOA and the subsequent removal of all sanctions against Iran would unleash the enormous oil production and export potential of the country once again, with both short-term and longer-term bearish effects on global oil prices. Regardless of any other considerations, Iran remains a great oil power, with an estimated 157 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves, nearly 10 percent of the world’s total and 13 percent of those held by OPEC. According to estimates from oil sector analysts at global energy markets intelligence company Kpler, with the removal of sanctions on it, Iran could see an 80 percent recovery of full production within six months and a 100 percent recovery within 12 months. “[As at the beginning of Q4 2021] Iranian crude oil production capacity stood at 3.9 to 4.0 million barrels per day [bpd] according to the NIOC [National Iranian Oil Company] with current output holding near 2.4 million,” according to Kpler. “Ultimately, we believe Iranian production could technically jump by 1.7 million bpd including 200,000 bpd of condensate and LPG/ethane, in a 6 to 9 month period from when sanctions are lifted and an immediate impact of a 5-10 percent fall in the oil price would be likely,” the company concluded.

3/23/2022,"Warren Buffett is channeling one of his long-held investing philosophies in his recent flurry of buzzy deals, says one fellow value-focused investor. That is to be greedy when others in the market are fearful. ""I think he is reminding us that when the tide goes out, we see who has been swimming,"" remarked Research Affiliates CEO Chris Brightman on Yahoo Finance Live. The 91-year-old billionaire investor revealed Monday that his Berkshire Hathaway will spend $11.6 billion to buy insurance company Alleghany. The deal will expand Buffett's insurance empire further beyond auto insurance player Geico and reinsurance beast Gen Re (General Reinsurance Corporation). Alleghany hauled in more than $12 billion in sales last year and $1.1 billion in net earnings. While diving deeper into the insurance space, Buffett has also gone shopping for energy names amid soaring crude oil prices in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Buffett scooped up another 18.1 million shares of Occidental for close to $1 billion last week. The latest purchases come hot on the heels of Berkshire spending $6 billion or so in the prior two weeks to buy up Occidental shares. Berkshire now owns nearly 14.6% of Occidental Petroleum through his roughly 140 million shares. The company will hold a key investor day on Wednesday. Interestingly these deals arrive despite Buffett's favorite stock market indicator flashing overvalued. Other investing pros echo Brightman's sentiment on Buffett's latest moves. They also point to Buffett likely realizing the world will eventually move beyond near-term headwinds such as the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia-Ukraine crisis. ""I think it [the deals] reminds me and should remind [everyone] that the world is still spinning. Companies are still planning for the future, and they are still doing the things that make them great companies,"" Baird strategist Michael Antonelli said on Yahoo Finance Live.
