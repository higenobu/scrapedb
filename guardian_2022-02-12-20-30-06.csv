2/12/2022,"The US supreme court, in a 5-4 decision, used the ruse that it was too close to an election – three months away – to scrap a racially discriminatory, Republican-drawn legislative map in Alabama. A lower court had previously ruled against the state because its gerrymandered congressional districts diluted the voting strength of African Americans by ensuring that 27% of Alabama’s population would garner only 14% of the state’s congressional representation. But that reality didn’t faze five justices; the US supreme court was just fine with letting a policy designed to disfranchise Black voters unfurl and do its damage in an oncoming federal election. The echoes of a brutal past are resonating in this decision.  After the civil war, Congress passed the 1867 Reconstruction Act, which provided that Black men had the right to vote, and then Congress followed that with the 15th amendment, which banned states from using race, color or previous conditions of servitude to undermine the right to vote. In a series of decisions in the late 19th and early to mid-20th centuries, however, the supreme court systematically dismantled those protections, as well as others crafted to support African Americans’ citizenship rights and defend against white domestic terrorism waged by the Ku Klux Klan and similar organizations. Focusing on voting rights gives some indication of how pernicious the decisions were. The 1874 Minor v Happersett ruling asserted that the right to vote was not part and parcel of American citizenship. In 1876, United States v Reese et al dealt with a Black man who was trapped in a malicious catch-22 that prevented him from voting. He tried to pay his poll tax, which was required to vote, but the tax collector refused to accept the payment and the registrars would not allow him to cast a ballot without payment. The court ruled, despite this crude and brazen denial of his right to vote, that the 15th amendment “does not confer the right of suffrage upon any one”. As states then began fully implementing Jim Crow legislation to disfranchise African Americans, the court, in the Williams v Mississippi (1898) decision, looked at the poll tax and the literacy test and ruled that those chokepoints to the ballot box – which had already removed 90% of registered Black voters in Mississippi from the rolls – did not violate the 15th amendment. In a 1903 case out of Alabama, Giles v Harris, the supreme court determined that it was powerless to stop a state from disfranchising Black voters even if the methods were unconstitutional. This assault on African Americans’ right to vote was an assault on American democracy aided and abetted by the highest court in the land. The results were devastating. By 1960, there were counties in Alabama that had no Black voters registered, while simultaneously having more than 100% of white age-eligible voters on the rolls. In Mississippi a mere 6.7% of eligible Black adults were registered to vote. It took the blood, the courage and the martyrdom of civil rights workers combined with the political spine of a president and congressional leaders to break this stranglehold on the right to vote. The legislature passed and President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act (VRA), which would save America from its worst self. And, this time, in the late 1960s, the US supreme court came down on the side of democracy and the 15th amendment. Two crucial decisions buttressed the VRA, noting that it was not only constitutional but also created to deal with “the subtle, as well as the obvious, state regulations which have the effect of denying citizens their right to vote because of race”. The Roberts court, however, bears no resemblance to the one in the 1960s and has all the anti-voting rights earmarks of the court after the civil war. The Roberts court’s assault on the VRA and the 15th amendment has been relentless and brutal to American democracy. The Shelby County v Holder (2013) decision ended the most powerful tool in the VRA’s wheelhouse, pre-clearance, and allowed states and jurisdictions with a demonstrated history of racial discrimination to implement laws and election policies without the prior approval of the US Department of Justice or the federal court in Washington DC. Within two hours of that decision, Texas implemented a voter ID law that led district court Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos to rule that the new measure not only had a discriminatory effect, it also had a discriminatory intent. The state appealed to the fifth circuit, pleading with the judges to not dismantle the voter ID law because it would be too disruptive to the looming midterm election in 2014. When the case reached the US supreme court, Justice Antonin Scalia’s majority ruled in favor of Texas without comment. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s dissent, however, tore away at the state’s ruse that it was too close to the midterms to stop a racially discriminatory law in its tracks. The greatest threat to confidence in elections, she wrote, was to allow a “purposefully discriminatory law, one that likely imposes an unconstitutional poll tax and risks denying the right to vote to hundreds of thousands of eligible voters” to be used in a federal election. But the majority on the US supreme court was fine with letting discrimination run wild in the election system. That has been abundantly clear in a number of voting rights cases that have come before the Roberts court since the Shelby County v Holder decision. Each one, whether massive voter roll purges in violation of the National Voter Registration Act, extreme partisan gerrymandered districts, or election laws that have a disparate impact on minorities, has been approved, either by acts of commission or omission, by the US supreme court. There are consequences. The very legitimacy of the court is at stake. Right now it’s as precariously perched as the right to vote and American democracy. Unfortunately, the Roberts court has played a major, horrific role in this preventable disaster.

2/12/2022,"Today in a nutshell: It was golden oldies day on the snowboard for the US, but there’s still no decision on whether one of the youngest athletes at the Games – Kamila Valieva –will be able to compete again Next up: There is some ski jumping, ice hockey, curling and the women’s skeleton still to be contested today. Tomorrow is the men’s giant slalom, the women’s monobob, and a couple more biathlon contests  After waiting 16 years to win a first Olympic gold medal, Lindsey Jacobellis captured her second in four days, pairing with Nick Baumgartner to win the inaugural mixed team snowboard cross event for the US. Baumgartner, 40, and Jacobellis, 36, become the oldest snowboarders to win any Olympic medal and the oldest Americans to win gold at the Winter Games since 1948. “We’re 80s babies and we were comin’ in hot today,” said Jacobellis. The journalists who broke the story of Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) skater Kamila Valieva’s positive drugs test on Wednesday say they have faced death threats, abuse, and warnings that they should check their tea. Valieva’s coach Eteri Tutberidze spoke to Russian state television for the first time since the scandal emerged, to say that she was certain the skater was “clean and innocent”. “It’s unclear why an athlete with a suspected doping on 25 December was cleared to compete at the Olympics,” Tutberidze said. “Either it is an ill-fated confluence of circumstances, or it’s a very well-planned plan.” Rachael Denhollander, the first woman to publicly accuse former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar of sexual abuse, has said the failed drug test was a reminder of how vulnerable young athletes remain. “A child does not make a choice to take those kinds of medications unless they’re given to her by somebody who’s in authority.” The US men’s ice hockey team pulled off a 4-2 win over Canada in Group A of the preliminary round. It doesn’t quite guarantee the US top spot in the group – they have one more group match to go, against Germany tomorrow. With NHL stars absent from Beijing, Brian O’Neill is the lone US returnee from the 2018 Olympics. “We didn’t back down from their physical play,” said US captain Andy Miele. “I love the way our team responded. I’m so proud of this group. We took a beating. They kept on going forward, we kept on coming back at them and got the outcome that we deserved.” ROC dominated the 4x7.5km women’s cross-country skiing relay, finishing over 18 seconds ahead of Germany in second place. Sweden took bronze, just half a second ahead of Finland after the 54-minute race. Things you might have missed Suzanne Schulting scored another Netherlands gold in the short track skating, winning the women’s 1,000m yesterday. She broke the world record along the way in the quarter-finals, and afterwards said: “I skated a world record and I was really excited. And then I said, ‘Oh damn, I still have to do the semis and then we have the finals.’” Also setting a record on the ice, Japan’s women’s speed skating team posted an Olympic one in the quarter-finals today. That competition concludes on Tuesday. Gao Tingyu thrilled the home crowd at the National Speed Skating Oval with an Olympic record and a gold medal for the hosts in the men’s 500m. Cha Min-kyu of South Korea took silver – just as he had in Pyeongchang last time out. Just 0.05 of a second separated third place from sixth place, but it was Wataru Morishige of Japan who won the bronze in the end by a whisker. Canada’s women raced into an early lead and never looked back in their ice hockey quarter-final against Sweden. They won yesterday’s late match 11-0. Today’s first quarter-final saw Switzerland knock out ROC 4-2. Canada and Switzerland will play each other in the semi-finals on Monday. The US look set to face Finland who were leading Japan 5-1 going into the third period of their quarter-final. In the women’s curling, after this morning’s fourth session, the US and Switzerland remain unbeaten after three matches. Japan, South Korea and Sweden are tucked in behind them in the standings with two wins and one defeat each. In the men’s, Sweden are at the top of the standings with a perfect four victories so far. Switzerland have three wins from four and are in second place. ‘Clean and innocent’: Valieva’s coach breaks her silence on doping scandal Equipment blamed for Team GB’s dismal skeleton performances Jaclyn Narracott on brink of history as Australian skeleton queen eyes gold Farewell to the Flying Tomato: how Shaun White left an Olympic legacy It was family joy for Norway in the men’s 10km spring biathlon.

2/12/2022,"Marie Gracie never met the boy, but his fate changed her life. On 2 September 2015, three-year-old Alan Kurdi washed up, drowned, on a Turkish beach. His family were Syrian refugees, trying to reach Europe. Journalist Nilüfer Demir took a photo. Alan lies face down, in a T-shirt and shorts. His feet are so tiny. His hands are upturned, facing the sky. “I’m a mother,” says Gracie, an artist from Milton Keynes. “Can you imagine anything worse than your child being in the news like that?” She reached out to her local chapter of Refugees Welcome, set up in the wake of the Syrian war.  “My family became the first buddy family for the first Syrian family that arrived in Milton Keynes,” she says. Gracie helped them with paperwork to get their children into school and set up doctors’ appointments. “Over time I haven’t had to do as much,” Gracie says, “but I still go and see them, and the mum calls me her ‘adopted mum’, because she won’t see her family again.” Over time, as the families got settled, there was less need for volunteers and Refugees Welcome disbanded, though Gracie stayed friends with her buddy family. But in August last year, US and British forces pulled out of Afghanistan and, within days, the country fell to the Taliban. Gracie began to hear whispers that Afghan families were arriving in Milton Keynes. A local charity asked for donations of toys for the children. Gracie pulled together some things, but missed the deadline for collection. A few days later, driving through town, she saw a group of people. “I realised instantly they were the refugees,” she says. As luck would have it, she had the toys in the boot, so she pulled up and handed them over. The refugees were being housed in a hotel. Gracie decided to go and introduce herself. “I went to the hotel and started chatting to people,” she says. “I said, ‘Welcome to England. How are you doing?’” The stories began to unfold. Many had fled Afghanistan with only the clothes on their backs. A church had found them some clothing, but the families still didn’t have everything they needed. Gracie appointed herself as a voluntary coordinator. She collected details of all 200 people: what they wanted, their shoe and clothing sizes. “I got a detailed picture,” she says. “Mr X needs a pair of size 8 boots; his daughters need three sets of pyjamas.” She added just about everyone she knew to a WhatsApp group, and sent out messages asking for clothes. When the donations started arriving, Gracie turned her front room into a sorting warehouse. “You can’t just dump a load of stuff on people,” she says, “because it causes rows. When people have had everything taken away from them, they’re desperate to grab on to things.” Instead, Gracie made customised packages for each family. She persuaded a hairdresser to offer free haircuts. She got English textbooks and a driving manual for every family. Many of the families have been stuck in hotel rooms for months. “They’re really fed up,” she says. “They just want a home, so they can start living. They are in limbo.” Not all the families get on. “Why would they?” Gracie says. “There’s no reason they should like each other.” The children are not in school. “It’s appalling,” she says. “What we’re doing to these people is causing them more stress. They’ve just left their family behind and watched their society fall apart and are getting daily reports of family and friends dying, and we can’t even put their kids in school on a temporary basis.” “Marie hasn’t just helped me,” says Khushal Saraj, who arrived in the UK with his family. He previously worked for the Afghan ministry of transport. “She’s helped every family here. She’s an amazing person.” Gracie is dispirited by the general public’s attitude towards refugees. “Attitudes have hardened,” she says. “The appetite for helping other people has lessened.” But her community feels different. “I haven’t found it hard to get people to say they will help,” she says. Gracie absolutely insists that her Guardian angel treat be something for the children. A local church is hosting a party and the Guardian hires Corina’s Cool Kids Parties as entertainers. Gracie phones me afterwards, buzzing but weary. “Today has been absolutely joyful” she says. The children “were contentedly screaming and jumping around and bouncing,” she says. “The entertainer made balloon hats and balloon animals and did games with the kids. It was so lovely. They all had fun.” It is the first winter for these children in a strange country. But thanks to Gracie and her fellow volunteers, they had a happy day – the children’s whoops of joy are still ringing in her ears. Want to nominate someone for Guardian angel?

2/12/2022,"Known as “The Cookie Lady” around Washington DC, Lacey Fisher is famous for her British- and German-inspired alcohol-infused confectionaries. Fisher launched Cookie Lane during the economic crisis of 2008, after being laid off from four different jobs as a mortgage auditor. “I ran through my six months of savings and rent was due,” Fisher says.  Eventually Fisher returned to her full-time job but continued to work on her fledgling cookie empire “part-time”, baking her popular pecan and chocolate boozy Southern Gentleman, New York Oatmeal and Big Daddy Chocolate Chip. She decided to solely focus on Cookie Lane after a work commute turned into a five-hour nightmare while her three-month-old baby was at home. And in November 2020, the cookie lady quit her day job. Fisher is just one of many Black women who left the workforce during the Covid-19 pandemic. In May 2020, Working Mother Research Institute reported that 52% of Black women were debating leaving their companies in two years. One major issue is pay. A 2021 LeanIn.org survey found that on average Black women are paid 37% less than white men and 50% of Black women and Latinas had trouble paying for basic expenses with less than $300 in savings, and that’s with a job. In the same survey women of color described the pandemic as devastating to their finances. Compared with white men, Black women are almost twice as likely to say they have been laid off, furloughed, or had their hours or pay cut because of the pandemic. Nicki Tucker, social media director and contributing writer to the State of Black Women in Corporate America report at LeanIn.org, says the financial hurdles combined with hostile work environments are the catalyst for Black women to leave corporate America and start their own company. “Our research shows that Black women are more likely to face a great deal of microaggressions, especially disrespectful and othering comments on their identity or appearance and less likely to be promoted at that first, critical step up from entry-level to manager, which is what we call the broken rung,” Tucker says. “Five to 10 years ago Black women wanted a seat at the table and now Black women are building that table.” Black women have a long history of entrepreneurship, says Tucker. Tucker, who comes from a family of Black women business owners, says Covid-19 is forcing the world to see Black women as enterprising. Women of color make up only 39% of women in the US but represent 89% of new women-owned businesses. Within that demographic, Black women are leading the charge at 42% of new women-owned businesses, followed by Latina women at 31%. If grit is the number one indicator of success, then Black women are the ideal prototype. Like Fisher, most Black women fund their businesses with personal savings and side jobs. These intrepid business owners learn skills along the way and integrate innovative solutions to their unique challenges. For example, Fisher sustained her business by leveraging social media and tapping into her real estate network offering gifts for their clients. During the Covid-19 pandemic she set up shop at the local farmers’ markets in Virginia and expanded into cities with higher levels of income. “We offered free delivery within a 20-mile radius if they ordered $15 worth of cookies. We also created virtual kitchen spaces by partnering with restaurants so customers could pick up their cookies,” Fisher says. “I didn’t feel comfortable raising our prices 30% to accommodate Uber Eats or Grubhub, so I hired 1099 workers [independent contractors] for delivery services, marked down the cookies and paid the workers out of pocket.” Cookie Lane survived the 2008 economic crisis and the pandemic while generating a profit. However, Fisher’s biggest obstacles have been access to funding and scaling her business to meet the growing demand. Organizations like Walker’s Legacy Foundation in Washington DC is one of many non-profits popping up to provide a support system for women like Fisher. Roughly 90% of Walker’s Legacy Foundation stakeholders are Black women who participate in various business accelerators that give additional skills and support to female entrepreneurs of color, says Ayris Scales, managing director of Walker’s Legacy. “So often Black women are entrepreneurs out of necessity. It’s interesting that Black women are really stepping up at this point, particularly during this time of economic uncertainty, because we’ve always had to navigate economic uncertainty,” Scales says. Black women were the fastest-growing group of entrepreneurs pre-Covid, but Scales says the pandemic saw side hustles become the primary source of income. These businesses tend to have a low barrier to entry and high growth potential, like health and beauty, PR and communications, home healthcare aides, childcare, culinary arts and IT. Walker’s Legacy recently finished their Covid-19 impact study and found that nearly 80% of the women surveyed are also caregivers. The majority of those surveyed are also the sole providers for their households and are caring for nieces, nephews and parents. Having the role of primary caregiver while working in a toxic environment or thwarted out of a position required many Black women to reassess the meaning of job security. “We now have women saying if I can do this for Tom, Dick and Harry, then I can take a chance and do this for myself,” Scale says. “So, we see more women saying I want to choose a different path and different type of lifestyle that is more authentic with where I feel I should be.” It’s an exciting time, says Scales, who is passionate about making sure Black women business owners are “capital ready”. Black women have the necessary skills, but many don’t go through the process of developing a business plan or understanding multiple lines of revenue. “We’re saying you already have the skills, you already run the business and we want to help you put some formality to it,” Scales says. “So when it’s time to scale, navigate the next pandemic or when you’re ready to have the conversation with a financial institution, you understand what you need to have in place to access capital.” Black women business owners have struggled with the false perception that they are unbankable and high-risk. Many say that investors have a set of criteria that are not culturally sensitive to Black women entrepreneurs. Scales says Black women are no more high-risk than a white counterpart who secures funding with just an idea. “We’re coming in after having run a business for five years and are showing them we have stayed afloat with little to no support and making money … so how can we be high-risk?” When evaluating Black-led businesses traditional financial institutions compare them to someone who has 10 times the budget or a much larger team, says Roshawnna Novellus, founder of the Atlanta based fintech company EnrichHER. Novellus, who holds a PhD in​​ systems engineering with a minor in finance, pivoted from her career in the financial sector to launch EnrichHER, a platform that connects revenue-generating companies led by women and people of color to various sources of funding. The company loans up to $250,000 to small businesses and services an 80% Black demographic. Novellus says establishing guidelines that are culturally in alignment with Black women is essential. “We have algorithms based on reducing the inherent bias in financial institutions. We build algorithms that are built on the skill set, the excellence, and the grit we illustrate that is highly correlated to our business success,” says Novellus. EnrichHER also offers educational programming for entrepreneurs to support Black women as they “try something new”. Novellus says for many Black women being a business owner is attractive and if small business is the backbone of the US economy then Black women are poised to become the largest contributors to economic growth. For women like Fisher, owning a business is about applying the grit to thrive, instead of merely surviving. “I’m a hustler,” says Fisher. “I’ll hustle just as hard for myself as I do for someone else. The problem is I was building someone else’s dream versus building my own dream. What matters is catching the dream that you have and setting that dream on fire.”",News/Business,Black women say goodbye to the job and hello to their own businesses,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/12/black-women-say-goodbye-to-the-job-and-hello-to-their-own-businesses
2/12/2022,"It is pleasurable to think of ripening tomatoes, the undeniably summery scent of bruised tomato leaves, and all the joys of eating a sun-warmed fruit fresh off the vine. And it is wise to be thinking of them now because the early bird catches the worm (or the ripe tomato). It is true that tomatoes can be started off as late as early April, but if you have space and a little heat in the form of a propagator, those started off this month will ripen sooner and taste sweeter for it. Tomatoes can be tricky: they are easily tormented by disease such as blight, munched by caterpillars and slugs, and if the summer is wet they can taste drab and watery. The way around this is to grow them under cover in a greenhouse, cold frame or polytunnel. Many varieties are actually bred for greenhouse production and won’t do well outside.  Ruthje, from Vital Seeds, is an organic greenhouse tomato bred for toughness. It doesn’t require high nutrient inputs, has a good skin that won’t split, an outstanding flavour, and stores well on and off the vine (no tomatoes dropping off to be eaten by the slugs before sunrise). It will also after-ripen, meaning that all the green toms you pick at the end of the season will continue to ripen in your kitchen. Alternatively, Santiam Sunrise is a yellow cherry with the finest flavour I’ve ever tasted. If you are able to get these to the kitchen before eating the lot off the vine then you have true willpower. They are addictively good, but do need growing under protection. I’d almost recommend buying a greenhouse just to grow them. If you are growing outside, go for varieties specifically bred for outdoor cultivation that ripen early. There are hundreds to choose from. Primabella has exceptional late blight resistance, which is a must outside a greenhouse. It has been bred to ripen early – you can expect red tomatoes by July – and has a good balance of acidity and sweetness. It’s a classic red cherry tom that won’t fail you, and open-pollinated too, so you can easily save your own seeds. Another outdoor variety worth trying is Moskvich, a cold-hardy, very early vine type from Russia that produces big red slicing toms with an excellent flavour. It is vigorous though, so you’ll have to keep on top of pinching out side shoots. But if all the talk of gardens and greenhouses is making you weep as you gaze out of your flat window, then I give you House, a tiny, tiny tom for all you flat dwellers with sunny sills. It loves life in a pot, in fact does better here than in the ground, and it’s early to produce too. Sow in the next couple of weeks and you could be eating ripe tomatoes by the end of June. But order promptly as seed will sell out fast.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Tomatoes needn’t be tricky to grow – but start them now for tasty, sweeter fruit | Alys Fowler",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/12/tomatoes-neednt-be-tricky-to-grow-but-start-them-now-for-tasty-sweeter-fruit
2/12/2022,"Chops are easy to cook, fast and reliable – the meat is so tender and yielding that it takes little effort to inject it with flavour to make it taste even more delicious. I like to use bone-in chops – meat cooked on the bone always has more flavour and is less likely to dry out, plus there is something lovely about gnawing at the spent bones on your plate. The length of time that they occupy the grill or pan is determined by the thickness of the chops, but it is essential to render down the fat until it’s beautifully amber.

Put the lamb in a shallow bowl. Mix all the ingredients for the marinade in a small bowl, pour this over the lamb and massage it in so the chops are well coated. Marinate for at least two hours, but preferably overnight. In the meantime, make the salad. Lay the cauliflower in a roasting pan and scatter over the coriander and fennel seeds, pul biber flakes, sea salt and pepper, then drizzle over the olive oil. Roast for 40 minutes, turning once, until the cauliflower is golden and charred. In a bowl, toss the cooked cauliflower with the dates, shallot, olive oil and lemon zest and juice. Get a griddle pan very hot, then cook the lamb cutlets for three minutes on each side, or until cooked to your liking. Make sure to prop up and cook the fatty side, too, so it gets golden and seared. Serve with the cauliflower salad and a dollop of labneh.

2/12/2022,"Britain has always been a nation of pet lovers. But since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, more than 3.2m households in the UK are thought to have acquired a pet. As demand for puppies, in particular, increased during lockdown, prices soared to an all-time high, with some dogs going for as much as £10,000, more than five times their usual price tag. The prices of kittens also rose by as much as 40%. Many new pet owners have struggled to cope with their new housemates. Animal rescue charities report a 20% jump in the number of pets being abandoned, while demand for “pet behaviour counsellors” has doubled.  Rabbits have proved the biggest source of “lockdown pet regret”, with two-fifths (42%) of owners regretting their purchase during the pandemic. “Taking on a pet, at any time, is a huge responsibility and before bringing one home it’s vital people consider whether they have the time and the finances to properly care for that animal for the rest of their life,” says RSPCA pet welfare expert Dr Samantha Gaines. “Across the sector we are seeing an increase in the number of animals abandoned as well as being surrendered. We fear this could worsen as people return to the office, or struggle with the increasing costs of living. “We believe that one of the main reasons people fail to care for their pets properly, or end up abandoning them, is a lack of research before they get their pet and a misunderstanding about the cost of pet ownership.” A survey of RSPCA frontline rescuers found that 95% listed the cost of care, including vet and grooming costs, as the number one reason for pet neglect. As well as food, vet care, insurance, toys and specialist equipment, pets may also need behaviour support and training. We spoke to people who bought a pet in the pandemic to find out how the rewards of ownership stack up against the costs. Pet’s name: Darcie.Breed: maltipoo dog (a Maltese crossed with a poodle).Upfront cost in Oct 2020: £3,000.Food and treats: £35 a month.Grooming: £25 every six to seven weeks.Insurance: £17 a month.Flea and worming treatments: £17 a month.Total monthly cost: £87. Nicole, 46, is an assistant manager for adult care services in Hatfield. In July 2020 her husband, Garry, was unexpectedly taken ill with a suspected heart attack. “Because of Covid I wasn’t allowed to go with him in the ambulance, or visit him in hospital. Our children were in bed, and in the morning I told them daddy was unwell but he would be out soon,” she says. “This wasn’t the case, and in two days I had the dreaded phone call to tell me he had died – there was nothing they could do.” Nicole had to break the news to their three children, who were nine, 10 and 16 at the time. “Our whole world collapsed,” she says. Watching TV alone one evening, she was engulfed with feelings of grief and loneliness. There was a big gaping hole, not only in her life but in the heart of her home. “I felt like we were a bit empty,” she says. “I knew we were missing something – something to love, cuddle and give us a focus in life.” She surprised her children with Darcie, a maltipoo puppy, the following weekend. Prices for these dogs soared over lockdown and she had to pay £3,000. “I haven’t told some of my family what she cost. I’m too embarrassed. But I had some money that Garry left me and I thought, ‘I know what I’m going to do with that. I’m going to buy something that will make us feel happy again’,” she says. Words cannot describe how much joy and comfort the dog has brought to her grieving children – “and most of all, to me”. In total, Darcie costs about £107 a month to feed and look after, and is “worth every penny”, Nicole says. “It’s almost as if she knew what she was there for. It sounds dumb but she really did heal us.” The dog seems to know when the children, and especially Nicole, need love and affection. “She became my rock, my strength.” Maltipoos shed little to no fur, so Nicole pays £25 to a groomer every six to seven weeks to ensure the dog does not get matted and dirty. “You’ve got to, with a breed like hers. I brush her regularly, as well.” To avoid being hit with large unexpected bills, Nicole also pays £17 a month for insurance and a further £17 a month for a healthcare plan her vet offers. “All the flea and worming treatments and annual vaccination boosters can end up being really costly. But when you pay monthly, it’s done, it’s paid for. You don’t have to worry about it.” Small mixed breeds are notoriously fussy about food, so, to save money, Nicole buys Darcie’s online in bulk rather than at the supermarket, after discovering the only brand she likes (Lily’s Kitchen) is cheaper that way. It is affordable, but she sometimes wonders what Garry would say if he knew she had spent £3,000 on a dog. As she had owned one before, she knew before about how much Darcie would cost each month. “I knew that it was a cost I could manage,” she says. And for her, the rewards of dog ownership far outweigh those costs. “I can’t even begin to tell you how much love and happiness she has brought into our lives.” Nicole is a member of the charity WAY Widowed and Young Pet’s name: Mademoiselle Chai.Breed: domestic short-haired cat.Upfront cost in April 2020: free.First vet bill: £350.Food and treats: £15 a month.Insurance: £13 a month.Flea and worming treatments: £12 a month.Cat sitting: £250 for a week.Total monthly cost: £40 Alicia, 52, is a ghostwriter who lives in Westcliff-on-Sea. As the UK locked down in March 2020, she noticed a young female cat hanging around her house. “She darted in my front door and continued to visit me – after a few times, she didn’t want to leave,” she says. “I would open the door to give her the opportunity … but she wouldn’t go.” The cat wasn’t microchipped but had been neutered. News was circulating that cats could get the virus (although there is no evidence they can transmit Covid to humans) and Alicia wondered if perhaps the cat, who looked approximately four months old, had been thrown out by her owners as a result. She worked with Pet Search South East, a local group for lost and found pets, put up signs locally and asked neighbours – but no one claimed her. “So in August, I did,” she says. She called her Mademoiselle Chai, after her favourite drink and the Hebrew word for life. “I really feel like we saved each other, as I am a single woman living alone with no family in the UK,” she says. “I literally had no human touch during the lockdowns but I did have a cat to cuddle.” Although she did not have to pay for Mademoiselle Chai, it cost about £350 to get her vaccinated, chipped and checked by the vet. “Money was tight but I thought, ‘This is a worthwhile investment,’” she says. “I knew I would be able to find a way to afford her.” She pays £12 a month for flea and worming treatments and annual vaccinations via the Healthy Pet Club plan, which also means she gets a 10% discount off bills and services at her local vet, and spends £15 a month on cat food (tins of Butcher’s), which she buys in bulk from Ocado to cut costs. She decided to get “really good insurance”, initially paying £156 a year for a policy connected to the veterinary charity PDSA. Each policy taken out contributes to the charity’s work treating animals whose owners are suffering economic hardship. So when her policy went up by £14 to £170 at renewal, she was OK with that, even though she had not made a claim. “If it happens regularly, I will shop around to find another insurer,” she says. “But I like the feeling that I’m helping to support a charity and I think they are more likely to honour claims.” One of the best purchases she made was a £31 Morpilot backpack she can put the cat in when she goes for a walk. “I can also use it to take her to the vets because I don’t have a car,” she says. One of the cat’s favourite toys is a £5 fishing rod but others, such as ribbons and string that she loves to chase around, were free. The biggest waste of money was spending £45 on scratching posts, which the cat refuses to use. The biggest expense has been paying for a cat sitter to cover trips away. Recently, Alicia found a newly graduated veterinary nurse via the website Cat in a Flat and paid her £250 to stay in her house for a week while she was on a work trip. “That gave me peace of mind,” she says. Despite all these costs, Alicia has no doubt that getting a lockdown pet – or, as she puts it, a “new best buddy” – was a good financial decision. “She makes me laugh and kept my spirits high during the pandemic. She was an unexpected gift in my life. I think an angel sent her to me.” Pets’ names: Radish and Lettuce.Breed: mini rex rabbit.Upfront cost in March 2021: £50 each.First vet bill: £100 each.Hutch, tunnel and playpen: £225.Hay: £5 for two bales, every two to three weeks.Food and treats: £15 a month.Chew toys: £5 a month.Litter tray liners: £6 a month.Nail clipping: £5 a rabbit, every two to three months.Insurance: £0.Rabbit sitting: £11 a day.Total monthly cost: about £18 a rabbit. Sophie, 50, works in Cambridge for a technology business. She decided to buy her three children a pair of rabbits in March 2021, during the third lockdown, because they had been begging for a pet and her eldest daughter, Alice, 13, had thoroughly researched getting one. “From my perspective, spending even £2 a week on them would be too much,” Sophie says. “But I knew this before we got them. It was an entirely child-related endeavour.” She opted for rabbits because she thought the children would be capable of looking after them by themselves, and it would be good for them to learn to do so. Alice has responsibility for feeding, ordering their food, cleaning out their litter trays and generally looking after the rabbits. When she came down with Covid last year and had to isolate from her parents, Lettuce and Radish were a great comfort. “I could play with them when mum and dad were working,” she says. She loves that they are excited to see her in the mornings and jump on to her lap to be stroked. “I think it’s really rewarding to have a pet.” The rabbits stay indoors, so Sophie does not see any need to insure them for theft, and plans to pay any vet bills that arise. The biggest expense was their hutch, which cost £185. Prices for double rabbit hutches start at £90 online but she decided to invest in an expensive one that would maximise the space available. She went for one from rabbit-hutches.co.uk that would fit neatly in to her kitchen. “It’s quite big, and because we keep them inside, we wanted it not to look too ugly,” Sophie says. She was also surprised to find it costs £11 a day in Cambridge to get an experienced sitter to feed the rabbits and change their litter tray (rabbits typically defecate up to 200 to 300 pellets a day) when the family go on holiday. Although the family spends £5 a month on chew toys for the rabbits, they also try to save by giving them cardboard and homemade toys that are safe to chew on. Overall, Sophie is not a big fan of the rabbits – “mostly because of the hay that is everywhere in the house, and the animal smell” – but she loves seeing how much her children care for them, and does not resent the monthly costs. “You know that they are going to be outrageous when you decide to get a pet. Whether it’s worth it or not entirely depends on how much you love the pet.”",Lifestyle/Money,Pandemic pets: how do owners cope as costs bound ahead?,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/12/pandemic-pets-how-do-owners-cope-as-costs-bound-ahead
