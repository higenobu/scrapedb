4/20/2022,"President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden released their income tax returns last week. The first couple reported $610,702 in adjusted gross income and paid $150,439 in federal income tax at an effective tax rate of 24.6%. While it’s unclear what former president Donald Trump’s income or tax bill was for 2021, we can compare Biden’s 2017 federal tax return with the data The New York Times reported on regarding Trump’s income tax payment in 2017. Biden’s 2017 tax return showed $11,031,309 in adjusted gross income and a federal tax payment of $3,553,249. The New York Times reported that Trump only paid $750 in federal income taxes that year, the same as he paid in 2016. According to The New York Times, the former president’s various businesses lost hundreds of millions of dollars over the previous 20 years, allowing him to reduce his federal tax obligation to almost nothing. Benzinga hasn’t seen Trump’s tax returns and cannot verify the facts reported on by the Times. However, assumptions can be made based on Trump’s largest business venture - his real estate holdings. See also: Top Real Estate Investment Companies in 2022 Real Estate Tax Benefits Real estate offers some unique tax advantages, mainly the ability to write-off depreciation against income. In fact, it’s quite common for a real estate investor to show a loss on their income tax return while actually receiving positive cash flow for the year. This tax strategy can be seen across almost all equity real estate investment trusts (REITs). For example, Piedmont Office Realty Trust (NYSE: PDM) reported a net loss of nearly $1.2 million for 2021, which included a $120.6 million expense for depreciation and amortization. The company’s actual funds from operations (FFO) was $245.4 million. While the company’s tax returns showed a loss, it was actually able to pay out over $104 million to its shareholders for the year in dividends. Another likely reason for Trump’s low tax bills is the use of a tax loss carryforward. Companies, such as The Trump Organization, can carry losses over from one year to offset taxes in subsequent years. Trump used this strategy after realizing nearly $1 billion in losses in the early 90s. He was able to carry those losses over each year until 2005. Joe Biden’s 2017 income, on the other hand, was mainly earned through speaking engagements and book deals, neither of which offers the same tax advantages as real estate. See also: Top REITs to Recession-Proof Your Portfolio How Individuals Use This Tax Strategy Individual real estate investors use Trump’s tax strategy every year, which is one reason real estate is such a popular asset class. Investors can even take advantage of these tax benefits without having to purchase a skyscraper, hotel or apartment complex themselves. Passive investments as a limited partner through private equity real estate deals can provide many of the same benefits. Investors that take part in a direct real estate investment through a crowdfunded offering will receive a K-1 tax document each year, which shows the investor’s share of net income, or loss, after deducting expenses like depreciation. It’s not uncommon for investors to receive cash distributions throughout the year, then be able to show a loss on their tax returns.

4/20/2022,"The stock market has fallen to start the year, and some stocks have fallen more than others. For investors, however, that brings up opportunities – just because a stock has fallen quite a bit doesn't necessarily make it a bad investment. The trick for investors is to tell the difference between stocks that are cheap at their new low prices and stocks that are truly broken. That’s where the Wall Street pros come in. These expert stock pickers have identified two compelling tickers whose current share prices land close to their 52-week lows. Noting that each is set to take back off on an upward trajectory, the analysts see an attractive entry point. Using TipRanks’ database, we found out that the analyst consensus has rated both a Strong Buy, with major upside potential also on tap. Let’s take a closer look. RumbleON (RMBL) We’ll start with RumbleON, a unique automotive-related company. The company offers an online platform to connect buyers and dealers of recreational sporting vehicles, particularly motorcycles, but also pre-owned powersports vehicles of all sorts. RumbleON’s omnichannel tech-based platform makes it easy for powersports fans to connect, to buy and sell, with the goal of making powersports more accessible to more people. RumbleON ran net losses through most of 2020 and 2021, but in 4Q21 the company reported an EPS profit of $1.35 on net income of $20.7 million. This was up dramatically from the $1.81 EPS loss in 4Q20. At the top line, the company showed $440.9 million in total revenue, up an impressive 47% year-over-year. For the full year 2021, the company had revenues of $1.58 billion, with an annual net income of $45.5 million – these were record results for a full year. During the first quarter of this year, RumbleON has been moving to expand its operations and footprint. The company acquired Freedom Powersports, a distributor for 15 manufacturers, selling through 13 retail locations. The acquisition expands RumbleON’s network to 55 brick-and-mortar locations. RumbleON paid $130 million for Freedom, in a transaction composed of both cash and stock. Despite the increasing earnings and expanding footprint, RumbleON shares have tumbled 48% this year. However, 5-star analyst Eric Wold, of B. Riley Securities, thinks this new, lower stock price could offer new investors an opportunity to get into RMBL on the cheap. ""We feel that RMBL shares have been overly punished and provide an increasingly attractive opportunity trading at 3.4x our 2023 AEBITDA estimate—or a ~38% discount to the median of the vehicle dealer peer group,” Wold opined. Wold goes on to explain why, in the event of increased recessionary pressures, RumbleON will find itself in a relatively strong position: “We believe the low inventory levels throughout the segment provide a hedge against that risk for RMBL. In typical recession scenarios, the industry would be facing too much inventory for the reduced demand and this would drive aggressive moves to sell inventory, including heavy promotional activities. However, that should not be the case now with the powersports industry and the RMBL dealer network were a recession to occur as the manufacturers would still need to fill a depleted dealer channel.” Based on all of the above, Wold rates RMBL a Buy, with a $70 price target to suggest an upside of 221% for the next year. (To watch Wold’s track record, click here) Wold may be exceptionally bullish, but the Street also is sanguine about RMBL. The stock’s 4 recent analyst reviews are all positive, giving it a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. With an average price target of $49, and a current trading price of $21.78, this stock has a one-year upside of 125%. (See RMBL stock forecast on TipRanks) Olo Inc. (OLO) The second beaten-down stock we’re looking at is Olo, whose name is an abbreviation of ‘online ordering.’ This New York-based cloud software company offers a B2B SaaS product, directed to restaurants; the platform allows business customers to place orders and direct deliveries, even from multiple suppliers and origination points. Olo has been in business since 2005, but only entered the public trading markets in March of 2021. Since that IPO, however, OLO shares have fallen drastically. In 2022, the stock is down 46%, and overall, it is down 68% from its first day’s closing price. The fall in share price came even as the company has shown solid earnings and profitable EPS in each of the four quarterly reports it has released since going public. At the top line, revenues have grown from $36.1 million in 1Q21 to $39.9 million in 4Q21; the last two quarters have shown sequential gains, and the 4Q top line was up 31% year-over-year. Non-GAAP EPS was steady at 3 cents per share in the first three reports, and slipped to 2 cents in the 4Q report; all four met or exceeded the earnings forecasts. On the balance sheet, Olo had $514.4 million in cash at the end of 2021. This emerging tech company caught the eye of Piper Sandler’s Brent Bracelin, a 5-star analyst ranked among the top 5% of his Wall Street peers. Bracelin writes, ""Q4 marks the seventh straight quarter of balancing of profitable growth, which is unique for a high-growth small-cap cloud software model... We continue to view 1Q22 as a potential growth trough as the company laps its toughest compare period, ahead of the Q2 reset in DoorDash pricing. That said, the FY22 outlook of 31% y/y at the midpoint suggests that top-line growth could reaccelerate exiting Q1.” Bracelin’s comments support his Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on Olo shares, and he gives them a $20 price target, indicating his confidence in ~78% upside potential for the next 12 months. (To watch Bracelin’s track record, click here) That the bullish view is par for this course is clear from Wall Street’s consensus – a Strong Buy, based on 5 unanimously positive analyst reviews. OLO shares are trading for $11.24, and their $21.60 average price target suggests an upside of 92% from that level over the next 12 months.

4/20/2022,"There’s plenty of talk around about the dreaded ‘R’ word, recession, as the markets are obviously cooling off following the prolonged bull runs of late 2020 and 2021. With inflation running at 40-year highs, and GDP growth slipping in Q1, it’s no wonder that people are talking about a return to the late ‘70s, and Carter-era economic malaise. But have we taken the pessimism too far? Covering the market situation for Wells Fargo, senior equity analyst Chris Harvey believes so. He sums up the forecast with a less grim view, in fact, with guarded optimism: “Despite daily calls for recession from anyone with a megaphone, we do not expect one over next 12 months. Rather, stagflation (high inflation/slower growth) likely will prevail, arguing for stable growers and low-vol stocks.” Harvey backs up that view with some specific data citations that should encourage investors, saying, “We do not expect the consumer to wilt given that jobless claims are at lows not seen since 1968 and US household net worth as of 12/31/21 was at an all-time high of $150T (10yr CAGR: 8.4%). This suggests recession risk is more fear than fact…” Still, we can’t discount continued inflation and equity volatility, nor can we fully discount recessionary possibilities; in all of those chances, a strong defensive stance, including high-yield dividend payers, will offer investors much-needed portfolio protection. Against this backdrop, Wells Fargo analyst Finian O’Shea has given the thumbs-up to two dividend stocks yielding 8% or better. Opening up the TipRanks database, we examined the details behind these two to find out what else makes them compelling buys. Crescent Capital BDC (CCAP) We’ll start with Crescent Capital, a business development company (BDC) with a focus on private mid-market firms. Crescent both originates and invests in the debt and equity of its target market, and has built up a portfolio totaling some $28 billion in assets under management. Turning to the company’s top and bottom lines, we find that Crescent saw $24.1 million in total investment income for 4Q21, the last quarter reported. This was nearly 4x the $6.6 million reported in 4Q20. At the bottom line, the firm reported EPS of 42 cents, just over the 41-cent forecast – but down from the 47 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. As 2021 ended, Crescent reported having $23.5 million in liquid assets on hand, along with $197 million in undrawn credit on its borrowing facilities. One clear attraction for investors here is Crescent’s high dividend. The most recent common share payment was made on April 15, at 41 cents; this annualizes to $1.64, and gives a yield of 9.2%. That yield is well over 4x higher than the average dividend yield found among S&P-listed firms. As additional inducements for dividend investors, Crescent has 5-cent per share special dividend payments scheduled for June and September of this year. Evaluating CCAP shares for Wells Fargo, analyst Finian O’Shea sees potential for the company deriving from its particular niche in the financial universe. “CCAP primarily originates in the lower middle to middle market, where we believe there is still some premium for origination vs. larger market deals, which are likely more widely shopped vs. syndicated or lightly syndicated markets. We see this corner of the private credit universe as providing incumbency benefits, wherein lenders can extract economics at the margin by being able to provide add-on and delayed draw term loans to buy and build PE-backed companies,"" O’Shea opined. These comments help to back up the analyst’s Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on this stock, while his $19.50 price target implies a one-year upside potential for the shares of ~10%. Based on the current dividend yield and the expected price appreciation, the stock has ~19% potential total return profile. (To watch O’Shea’s track record, click here) The Wells Fargo view is one of three recent analyst reviews on CCAP shares, and all are positive, giving the stock a Strong Buy consensus rating. CCAP is currently trading for $17.79, and the $20 average price target implies ~12% upside potential. (See CCAP stock forecast on TipRanks) Barings BDC, Inc. (BBDC) The second dividend stock we’ll look at is Barings, another BDC firm. Barings BDC is part of the larger Barings LLC asset manager, a financial giant with over $390 billion in total AUM. Barings BDC occupies one of the smaller niches, providing credit and equity investment in mid-market companies – and leveraging its support from the larger Barings LLC parent company to support its portfolio. Barings BDC’s portfolio currently has a fair value of $1.8 billion. According to the last quarterly release, for 4Q21, Barings BBDC’s portfolio value includes 54 investments newly made in Q4, totaling $489.5 million. The portfolio brought Barings BDC a total investment income of $36.6 million, and a net investment income per share of 23 cents. Q4 revenues were more than double the year-ago quarter’s total of $17.8 million, while the 23-cent EPS was up 4 cents, or 21%, from the 19 cents recorded in 4Q20. For dividend investors, this company’s recent payment history is clear attraction: Barings BDC has raised its quarterly common share dividend payment 9 times in the last 12 quarters. The company’s current dividend payment, of 23 cents per common share, annualizes to 92 cents and yields a high 8.6%. In another move of interest to investors, BBDC has been expanding its footprint through acquisitions. In its most recent combination, the company merged with Sierra Income Corporation, forming a combined entity with more than $2.7 billion in assets under management. The merger, an all-stock transaction, was completed in late February and resulted in Barings BDC shareholders owning 58.75 of the combined company. Covering the stock for Wells Fargo, O’Shea highlights the key points driving his bullish thesis for the stock. “We believe BBDC presents an intriguing risk-adjusted yield based on several downside mitigants -- credit support agreements, and a total return lookback -- which are only enhanced by its industry best hurdle rate of 8.25% per year... Given an increase in the low hurdle to 8.25%, and likely NAV improvement in 1Q22, owed to the addition of the Sierra CSA to the balance sheet, we believe there is a relatively smooth path toward a quarterly dividend of $0.24,"" O’Shea wrote. To this end, O’Shea rates BBDC an Overweight (i.e. Buy) along with a $13 price target. This figure implies ~22% upside from current levels. The Wall Street analyst corps agree with the Wells Fargo view; BBDC gets a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating based on 3 positive reviews. Looking forward, the $12.50 average price target predicts ~17% upside from the share price of $10.64.

4/20/2022,"How much of your income will you need to replace in retirement to maintain your current lifestyle? It's a pivotal question and the answer will serve as a foundational piece of your plan for retirement. After all, you can't set a retirement savings goal without knowing your spending needs. While experts typically recommend replacing between 70% to 90% of your pre-retirement income when you stop working, J.P. Morgan Asset Management has developed more precise targets that are based on your household income. A financial advisor can help you plan for retirement and determine how much of your pre-retirement income you'll need to replace once you stop working. Find a trusted fiduciary advisor today. The more money a person or family makes prior to retirement, the lower their replacement rate will be. For example, a household with $300,000 in pre-retirement income will need to replace only 72% of this money through Social Security, employer-sponsored retirement accounts, IRAs and other sources. At the other end of the spectrum, a family with only $50,000 in pre-retirement income will need to replace a far higher percentage, about 94%, according to J.P. Morgan. Here's a closer look at the financial services firm's guidance. Calculating Your Income Replacement According to J.P. Morgan's income replacement targets, $80,000 is a key threshold that determines how much of their pre-retirement income retirees need to replace. Those who make under $80,000 will need to plan to replace more than 90% of their earnings with Social Security benefits, withdrawals from 401(k)s or similar accounts and other private sources. Households making between $80,000 and $150,000 should aim to replace between 89% and 80% of their pre-retirement income. The replacement rate drops into the 70th percentile for households that make between $150,000 and $300,000 per year Here's a look at the specific income replacement targets that J.P. Morgan Asset Management developed using Consumer Expenditure Survey data from 2016 to 2019 for income and longitudinal Chase data from 2013 to 2020 for spending: $30,000 in pre-retirement income Income replacement rate: 98% $40,000 in pre-retirement income Income replacement rate: 96% $50,000 in pre-retirement income Income replacement rate: 94% $60,000 in pre-retirement income Income replacement rate: 93% $70,000 in pre-retirement income Income replacement rate: 92% $80,000 in pre-retirement income Income replacement rate: 89% $90,000 in pre-retirement income Income replacement rate: 88% $100,000 in pre-retirement income Income replacement rate: 86% $125,000 in pre-retirement income Income replacement rate: 83% $150,000 in pre-retirement income Income replacement rate: 80% $175,000 in pre-retirement income Income replacement rate: 78% $200,000 in pre-retirement income Income replacement rate: 76% $250,000 in pre-retirement income Income replacement rate: 73% $300,000 in pre-retirement income Income replacement rate: 72% Bottom Line Figuring out how much money you'll need on a yearly basis in retirement is a key first step in the planning process. Experts generally recommend replacing anywhere between 70% and 90% of your pre-retirement income through Social Security benefits, withdrawals from 401(k)s or similar accounts, IRAs, taxable accounts and other private sources. But J.P. Morgan has developed even more specific income replacement targets that correspond to household income. The more a household earns, the lower the income replacement target. The lower the household's pre-retirement income, the higher the replacement target will be. Households that earn less than $70,000 prior to retirement will need to replace at least 90% of that income once they stop working, according to J.P. Morgan. However, those that earn over $150,000 will need to replace less than 80% of that income. Retirement Planning Tips There's a lot to consider when planning for retirement. A financial advisor can help you sort through the myriad of decisions you'll need to make as you wind down your career, including when to claim Social Security and how to reduce your tax liability in retirement. Finding a qualified financial advisor doesn't have to be hard.

4/20/2022,"The oldest advice in the financial markets is to buy low and sell high. The trick to winning, however, is to find the right stocks to buy, and to remember that ‘buy low’ doesn’t always mean these stocks can't go lower. Sometimes the best bargains really do come in at the lowest prices. There are plenty of stocks under $10 that won’t break your bank and still offer substantial upside potential. How substantial? Well, one analyst at investment banking giant Morgan Stanley has been tapping two winners among these low-cost stocks, and she sees the upside beginning at 100% or better. We can dig deeper into the Morgan Stanley picks using the TipRanks database, to find why these lost-cost stocks are getting the thumbs up. Rocket Lab USA (RKLB) First up is a California-based company that works in a futuristic niche – space flight. Rocket Lab is a non-governmental space launch company, offering customers access to the Electron small orbital launch vehicle, which it boasts is the second-most frequently launched US rocket. The Electron, which boosts payloads up to 300kg into low Earth orbit, is on the only reusable small launch vehicle in service. Rocket Lab has completed 25 Electron launches to date, successfully deploying 112 satellites into orbit. In a major announcement for the company, Rocket Lab released news that it will attempt a mid-air helicopter recovery of the Electron vehicle’s first stage in the next scheduled launch, later this month. Currently, the company complements the Electron rocket with the Photon customizable orbital spacecraft. Looking forward, Rocket Lab is developing the Neutron rocket, a large-scale reusable launch system, which will be able to deploy a 13,000kg payload into low Earth orbit, or a 1,500kg payload into an orbital trajectory to Mars or Venus. During 2021, Rocket Lab was awarded a contract from the US Space Force, worth $24 million, to complete development of the Neutron’s upper stage. Building on its launch program, and to raise capital for its development program, Rocket Lab entered the public markets in August of last year. The stock’s entry to the NASDAQ came through a business combination with a SPAC firm, Vector Acquisition Corporation, and brought the space launch company as much as $777 million in gross proceeds. Since going public, Rocket Lab has reported fiscal results for three quarters, starting with 2Q21 last September. The company saw zero revenue in that quarter – but reported $5.3 million in 3Q21, which more than quintupled to $27.5 million in 4Q21. Full-year revenue for 2021 came in at $62.2 million, up 77% year-over-year. Kristine Liwag, Morgan Stanley’s resident expert on the Aerospace & Defense sector, sees the upcoming helicopter retrieval attempt as the key catalyst for Rocket Lab, writing: “We view RKLB’s upcoming mid-air booster retrieval attempt as a potential near-term catalyst as a successful operation would reflect a key milestone as the company executes on its strategy to increase rocket reusability (and thus lower cost).” Going on, Liwag points out how this retrieval capability will set Rocket Lab apart from its peers: “We view the company’s ongoing and planned innovations in rocket reusability enabling Rocket Lab to potentially further widen the moat between itself and competitors... These innovations could enable recovery of ~70-80% of each rocket’s economic value, allowing Rocket Lab to potentially further drive down vehicle costs and insulate itself from potential pricing pressures engendered by rival small launch offerings and rideshare services.” In line with her comments, Liwag rates Rocket Lab shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy), with a $17 price target to imply a robust 109% upside for the stock. (To watch Liwag’s track record, click here) Overall, with 6 recent Buy ratings overpowering a single Hold, Rocket Lab gets a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus. The shares are priced at $8.11, and their $18.86 average target suggests ~133% upside from that level. (See RKLB stock forecast on TipRanks) Joby Aviation (JOBY) Sticking with the Aerospace realm, we’ll look over at Joby Aviation. This is a mid-cap firm, working on development of a new urban commuter aircraft. Joby’s proposed aircraft is an electrically powered vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) model, designed for the urban air taxi niche. Joby has demonstrated the concept through small-scale remotely controlled drones, and is currently testing a full-sized prototype. The company is aiming for FAA type certification next year. Joby’s prototype commuter aircraft uses six electric motors, in a tilt-rotor configuration. The engines are aligned at the leading edges of the wing and tail surfaces, in a layout that optimizes motor and rotor efficiency. Joby’s concept plane has 5 seats – a pilot and four passengers – plus room for passenger luggage, and is designed to fly up to 150 miles on a full battery charge, with a top speed at 200 mph. Last year, in August, Joby completed a SPAC combination with Reinvent Technology Partners, and entered the NYSE on August 11. The company’s realized proceeds, plus cash on hand, brought the balance sheet to $1.6 billion after the business combination. The company is highly speculative, but last year, while the SPAC combo was in planning and in progress, Joby achieved several milestones. The pre-production prototype aircraft flew a total of 5,300 miles in test flights. That total included a flight on 154.6 miles on a single battery charge – the longest single flight, and an important proof-of-concept for the prototype’s proposed performance. Joby has also completed construction of its second pre-production prototype, and the first FAA production conformity inspection. Once again, we’ll check in with Morgan Stanley’s Kristine Liwag, who lays out this aircraft maker’s strengths: “Joby continues to progress on their path to aircraft certification with meaningful steps forward in the certification and manufacturing process, along with strides in pushing the flight envelope of the aircraft. The company made meaningful progress in the certification process as it began manufacturing conformity testing and completed their first Systems and Compliance Reviews with the FAA.” ""Strides were made on the manufacturing front as the company began the manufacturing of their first production-intent aircraft. The design of the aircraft is yet to be frozen, but the idea is to have more conforming production with each passing aircraft across the line,"" Liwag added. Overall, Liwag believes this is a stock worth holding on to. The analyst rates JOBY shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and her $115 price target indicates room for 209% one-year upside potential. (To watch Liwag’s track record, click here) With 2 Buy ratings and 1 Hold assigned in the last three months, the word on the Street is that JOBY is a Moderate Buy. Not to mention the $100 average price target brings the upside potential to ~121% from the current trading price of $5.14.

4/20/2022,"It’s no secret that inflation is breaking record 40-year highs, as it just hit 8.5%. High inflation and other factors have led to an inverted yield curve in March 2022. With an inverted yield curve, short-term Treasury bonds have higher interest rates than long-term ones, which normally isn’t the case. An inverted yield curve is often interpreted as an early predictor of a recession. The yield curve inverted before the 2001, 2008 and 2020 recessions. However, real estate investment trusts (REITs) can be a good investment during high inflation since they earn most of their revenue from tenant rents, which increase during this time. All REITs aren’t created equal, and this guide shows you a few options that can help your portfolio withstand a recession. What Are Publicly Traded REITs? Publicly traded REITs are registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and trade on a stock exchange like the Nasdaq exchange or New York Stock Exchange. Advantages of publicly traded REITs include: Higher liquidity Greater transparency Lower barrier to entry Two In-Demand Publicly Traded REITs 1. Digital Realty Trust Data science is one of the most in-demand fields, which is predicted to have a job growth rate of 28% through 2026. One way to invest in real estate and data science simultaneously is via a REIT called Digital Realty Trust Inc. (NYSE: DLR). This firm acquires, operates and manages data centers in the U.S. as well as in 25 other countries. The company is growing substantially since it acquired a major stake in a premier African data firm, Teraco. Digital Realty Trust outpaces its competition with a three-year net income growth rate of 72.8% and a relatively low debt-to-equity ratio of 0.84%. 2. Extra Space Storage Since the COVID-19 pandemic, more people have moved, increasing the need for storage space. Extra Space Storage (NYSE: EXR) is a publicly traded REIT that meets this demand throughout most of the U.S. In addition to personal storage space, customers can also store larger items like RVs, cars and boats. Its stock price has grown by 56% since April 2021. Compared to the competition, it has a higher profit margin and a return on equity (ROE) of 52.40% and 29.18%, respectively. Public, Non-Traded REITs Public, non-traded REITs are registered with the SEC but don’t trade on major stock exchanges. By not trading on exchanges, these REITs aren’t subject to daily stock market price changes, which makes it easier for fund managers to focus on long-term goals and can reduce risk and volatility. Registration with the SEC provides transparency. Platforms like RealtyMogul and Streitwise help average individuals invest in public, non-traded REITs. With RealtyMogul, investors select from retail, office, multi-family and apartment complex investment options. Streitwise currently has one main offer, 1st Streit Office, which is currently composed of two class A commercial properties.

Investing in real estate, especially with REITs, can be a useful inflation hedge. Unlike fiat currency, real estate is a tangible asset, and rents rise during inflationary periods. Publicly traded and non-traded REITs serve sub-niches like data science or healthcare. Perform due diligence before investing and realize that some of the more profitable REITs tend to serve high growth, in-demand sub-niches, including the data science and self-storage sectors.
