5/14/2022,"Yesterday on Fox News, China-born GOP House candidate Lily Tang Williams expressed that she feared America was beginning to become like China, the country she left.

In the segment, host Tucker Carlson began by reporting on Shanghai’s complete lockdown, describing how Chinese authorities were “ripping children from their parents’ arms” and “sending people to concentration camps,” referring to China’s quarantine centers.

 

Carlson condemned the East Asian country’s “totalitarian” measures but stated that the U.S.’ lack of critique and even “praise” was a cause for even more concern.

“Watching that, you begin to ask yourself, ‘What can stop something like that from happening here if the people from our country are for it?'” warned Carlson.

He then introduced Lily Tang Williams, who is running for Congress for the state of New Hampshire, by playing her campaign ad.
 

 


“I was born in China to ... illiterate, working-class parents,” Williams, who is also chair of the New Hampshire Asian American Coalition, begins. “Suffered under Mao’s cultural revolution and communist dictatorship. I wanted freedom; America was my promised land.”

“People are losing their rights to make a living and make their own life choices. Are you worried yet? I am. I fear the country I love is becoming the country I left.”

After the video, Carlson turned to Williams for a live interview.

“It sounds like your childhood in a repressive country really informs how you view America right now.”

“Well, I [came] to America for freedom and prosperity, [and to] live my American dream,” she replied. “I’m just worried that this American dream will not be there for my children who were born in this country.”

Williams also added that she was seeing a “rise of authoritarianism and tyranny” and that she did not want “another cultural revolution happening in [her] new country.”

Carlson asked if the U.S. leaders “praising” China made her feel “uncomfortable.”

“Not just uncomfortable,” responded Williams. “I’m terrified.”

On her Twitter, Williams describes herself as a “communism survivor” and “freedom lover.”

In her recent Tweet, she writes that she “fled China for America in 1988” and was running to “fight for freedom” and “keep the American Dream alive.”

Her logo appears to be that of a lily flower, a reference to her name, painted in the colors of the U.S. flag, with a star in the center and stripes on one of the petals.

5/14/2022,"WEST PALM BEACH — Bob Sullivan's 16-year-old daughter attends Dreyfoos School of the Arts. Sullivan was shopping at Aldi Friday when he received a string of text messages from his daughter. ""Hi dad we are on a code red right now. Its real. I love you,” she wrote. What happened: Students, staff safe after shooting by West Palm Beach police at Dreyfoos School of the Arts More: How did Palm Beach County high schools fare in the 2022 U.S. News & World Report rankings? More: Dreyfoos' history could bring schools $8M, but could it create workforce housing, too? Friday afternoon, a van crashed through a metal fence and onto the Dreyfoos campus in West Palm Beach with city police in pursuit, sending the school into lockdown. A West Palm Beach police officials say the city police shot the man who had gotten out of the van and was acting erratically. Upon reading his daughter's texts about the incident, Sullivan immediately dropped his groceries and rushed to the school, imagining the “worst-case scenario,” he recounted, fighting back tears. Meanwhile, his daughter, an 11th-grade visual arts student, took refuge behind a locked door in a women’s locker room as the incident unfolded. Sullivan arrived to a sea of flashing red and blue lights. Standing behind yellow police tape near Fern Street and South Sapodilla Avenue, he read new text messages from his daughter, whom he asked not to be named. She heard banging on the door, as someone announced, “Police,” but she was hesitant to leave. Coordinating her rescue from the outside of campus, Sullivan spoke with a police officer, who assured the worried father that it was now “100% safe"" for his daughter to come out of hiding. All he could do was wait. Sullivan stared at the campus, eagerly awaiting news on his daughter. Sullivan said his family lived in Parkland in 2018. They felt an immediate wave of grief that followed the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, and on Friday afternoon, those memories came rushing back. “She is safe but traumatized,” Sullivan said of his daughter.

5/14/2022,"Ukrainian fighters used a captured tank nicknamed ""Bunny"" against its previous owners, the Russians. The T-80 tank has destroyed dozens of Russian vehicles and several tanks in the past several weeks. On May 9, Ukraine mocked Moscow's ""Victory Day"" with a parade featuring captured Russian tanks. Ukrainian volunteer forces have been using a captured T-80 tank nicknamed ""Bunny"" against the machine's previous owners — the Russian army. The tank was built two years ago and, up until March of this year, was controlled by Russian forces, according to CNN's Sam Kiley, who met with the volunteer fighters in Ukraine. A Ukrainian soldier identified solely as Alex, a former software engineer who used to live in the country's second-largest city of Kharkiv, said he was on a sniper mission when he discovered the abandoned tank in a field in March — just eight days into the unprovoked Russian invasion of Ukraine, Kiley reported. ""This is like my personal tank. I am [the] tank commander and tank owner,"" Alex told Kiley in an interview, adding that the ""slightly modernized"" tank features an auto-loader and can ""shoot more advanced, better rounds,"" including guided missiles. In March, ""Bunny"" destroyed two dozen Russian military vehicles and several tanks, Kiley told CNN. Ukrainian and Western officials said earlier this week that Russian forces appear to be withdrawing from the Kharkiv region, The New York Times reported. It was a significant setback for the Russian army since its retreat from Kyiv in early April. UK defense officials cited Russia's ""inability to capture key Ukrainian cities"" and ""heavy losses"" as the reason behind the withdrawal. Earlier this week, Ukraine mocked Russia's annual ""Victory Day"" military celebration in Moscow by hosting their own ""parade"" featuring captured Russian tanks, ""ruining the holiday for the occupiers,"" the Ukrainian Defense Ministry wrote in a tweet. Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered an address during the Russian ""Victory Day"" celebration on Monday, calling Ukraine and its leaders ""Nazis"" but did not mention a declaration of war following warnings from Western officials. ""The West was preparing for the invasion of Russia. NATO was creating tensions at the borders. They did not want to listen to Russia. They had other plans,"" Putin said in his Victory Day speech. ""You are fighting for the motherland, for its future, so that no one forgets the lessons of World War II, so that there is no place in the world for executioners, punishers, and Nazis.""

5/14/2022,"For the first time since Brittney Griner’s arrest almost three months ago, Russia appears to have publicly signaled its asking price for her safe return, if multiple reports by Russian state media are to be believed. Russia is looking to exchange the WNBA star in a prisoner swap for notorious convicted arms trafficker Viktor Bout, several state-owned Russian news outlets reported Friday, citing unnamed government sources. Bout, whose exploits earned him the nickname the “Merchant of Death,” flooded fierce conflicts in Africa and the Middle East with weapons, U.S. authorities say. He was arrested during a sting operation in Thailand in 2008, extradited to the U.S. and sentenced to 25 years for conspiracy to kill US citizens, delivery of anti-aircraft missiles, and providing aid to a terrorist organization. After Bout’s arrest, the U.S. alleged that his Russian allies tried to block his extradition from Thailand to America by bribing key witnesses to give false testimony. Since his 2012 conviction, Bout has been at the top of Russia’s prisoner exchange wish list and has been linked repeatedly in the Russian state media with potential swaps involving jailed Americans that haven’t come to fruition. U.S. Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan visited Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Moscow on Wednesday, but the State Department did not disclose what they discussed. A spokesperson for the State Department declined comment to Yahoo Sports on Friday when asked if negotiations for Griner’s release were underway and if Russia was seeking a trade for Bout. “Due to operational and privacy concerns, we are unable to discuss specific details,” the spokesperson said. While one Russian state media report quoted an unnamed source who described a potential Griner-for-Bout exchange as “likely,” experts in Russian diplomacy viewed that skeptically. William Pomeranz, a professor of Russian law and the acting director of the Kennan Institute, told Yahoo Sports that he interprets the reports as a signal that “Russia really wants to make that trade” but cautioned that they give no indication of the U.S.’s willingness. “This is Russia saying, ‘Wouldn’t this be a great idea?’” Pomeranz said. “This isn’t the U.S. saying they’re interested. We’ve had other opportunities to get rid of Viktor Bout in the past and we haven’t done it.” Griner has been behind bars since Feb. 17 when she flew into a Moscow airport and Russian customs officials allegedly found vape cartridges containing hashish oil in her luggage. She is under investigation for the large-scale transportation of drugs and faces up to 10 years in a Russian prison if convicted. Griner appeared at a hearing in a courtroom outside Moscow on Friday and had her pre-trial detention extended by a month. Photos taken at the hearing show Griner leaving the courtroom handcuffed, the hood of an orange sweatshirt pulled over her head and her signature dreadlocks peeking out. Last month, the U.S. and Russia completed a prisoner swap despite deteriorating relations between the two nations. Trevor Reed, the former Marine who the U.S. says was wrongfully detained in Russia for almost three years, came home in exchange for Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian pilot convicted of drug trafficking. The release of Reed leaves at least two Americans in Russia who the U.S. classifies as wrongfully detained: Griner and Paul Whelan, another former Marine sentenced to 16 years on spying charges. Their cases are now in the hands of the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, which focuses on negotiating the release of American hostages and others deemed to be wrongfully detained in foreign countries. A 1-for-1 exchange for Griner could be especially unpalatable for the U.S. if Russia insists on Bout in return. Bout is a far more notorious figure than Yaroshenko, having inspired Nicolas Cage’s character in the 2005 movie “Lord of War.” Bout’s arms trafficking history also makes the allegations against Griner appear minimal by comparison. Former top pentagon official Evelyn Farkas hopes the Biden Administration explores all options to get Griner and Whelan home, but she points out there is a downside to prisoner exchanges. “This is the kind of situation that we want to avoid,” said Farkas, the executive director of the McCain Institute, “because the Russians will continue to seize Americans as trade bait if we agree to such swaps.”",World/Yahoo Sports,Reports: Russia wants 'Merchant of Death' in exchange for Brittney Griner,https://news.yahoo.com/russias-asking-price-for-brittney-griner-may-be-notorious-arms-trafficker-004449470.html
