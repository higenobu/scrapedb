3/21/2022,"Following on from their experiment from 2020 where they gave up drinking alcohol for one month, YouTubers Craig and Chyna Benzine took up the challenge again in late 2021. In a new video, they check in after four months with no booze and share how they're feeling. To begin with, Craig starts to feel tired in the evenings, which he suspects has to do with his body expecting the usual hit of energy that he would usually get from a drink. For similar reasons, he has sugar cravings in the evenings for the first month or so. Chyna makes one exception and has a single celebratory drink on Christmas Eve, and is surprised to find she doesn't enjoy it as much as she anticipated. ""It was good, but it wasn't as good as I expected it to be,"" she says. ""It didn't hit the way I thought it would."" After a while, Craig notices a considerable increase in his work productivity, and they both say they've experienced a minor improvement in the quality of their sleep. ""It feels like deeper, better sleep,"" he says. ""When I wake up, I do feel more refreshed."" Craig adds that while he hasn't lost weight, he has found it easier to maintain his current weight without really trying too hard. At the end of the four months, both Craig and Chyna have decided that the benefits of going teetotal largely outweigh any enjoyment they once took in beer and cocktails. And having found a wide variety of non-alcoholic alternatives, they decide that they are going to keep going. ""I don't miss drinking,"" Chyna concludes. ""At this point I don't think I want to start drinking again, at least not very regularly.""

3/21/2022,"BOSTON (AP) — A Dominican drug trafficker who was jealous of David Ortiz and felt disrespected by him had him shot at a Dominican nightclub in 2019, according to private investigators the Red Sox slugger hired to look into the attack that nearly killed him. The findings by former Boston police commissioner Edward Davis reported by the Boston Globe on Saturday contradict the theory of the crime developed by Dominican prosecutors. Davis told the newspaper that he identified the drug-trafficker César Peralta as having orchestrated the shooting by placing a bounty on Ortiz and sanctioning the hit squad that tried to kill him. Dominican authorities did not cooperate with the private investigation. Peralta is being held in held without bail in Puerto Rico on unrelated charges of conspiracy to import cocaine and heroin. The U.S. Treasury designated Peralta a drug kingpin in 2019 and he was extradited to the U.S. territory in December. Ortiz’s spokesperson, Joe Baerlein, told the Globe that Davis’ findings were withheld for Ortiz’s safety until Peralta was in U.S. custody. Peralta has not been charged in relation to Ortiz's shooting. Peralta’s lawyer, Joaquin Perez, said Peralta had nothing to do with the attempt on Ortiz’s life. “As bad as César Peralta is, it’s not even close to being in the ballpark to say he had something to do with this,” Perez said. Perez described Ortiz and Peralta as “close friends.” Ortiz told The Globe he knew Peralta only casually and that he was “sad, confused, angry, all kinds of emotions” when he received the news from Davis and Ric Prado, a former high-ranking CIA official who participated in the inquiry. Dominican authorities have said the target was meant to be Sixto David Fernandez, who was sharing a table with Ortiz when he was shot. Authorities said the hit men confused Fernandez with Ortiz, one of the most popular Dominican ballplayers ever. Thirteen people have been charged in relation to Ortiz’s shooting and are awaiting trial in the Dominican Republic. Baerlein said Ortiz was waiting further legal action in the Dominican and U.S. courts to bring clarity about why this happened to him. A 10-time All-Star, Ortiz helped the Red Sox end their 86-year championship drought in 2004 and batted .688 against the St. Louis Cardinals in 2013 to win the Series MVP. Ortiz retired after the 2016 season with 541 home runs, and the team retired his uniform No. 34. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first appearance on the ballot in January. Ortiz maintained a home in the Boston area and had been living part of the year in the Dominican Republic. He was seriously wounded in the June 9, 2019 shooting. Doctors in the Dominican Republic removed Ortiz’s gallbladder and part of his intestine after the shooting and he underwent further surgery in the U.S. Ortiz told the Globe he wants to know why anyone might want him dead, but ""the most important thing is, thank God I’m alive.”",U.S./Associated Press,Private investigator says drug kingpin targeted David Ortiz,https://news.yahoo.com/private-investigator-says-drug-kingpin-154649061.html
3/21/2022,"Russian journalist Marina Ovsyannikova's decision to publicly protest against her country's invasion of Ukraine didn't come easy, she recalled in an ABC News interview released Sunday. ""As soon as the war began, I could not eat. I could not sleep,"" Ovsyannikova said in Russian, according to ABC's translation. Ovsyannikova, an employee of the state-run Channel One, said she contemplated going to a street protest against the war, but the prospect of spending years in jail convinced her to make a more public statement. The news editor ultimately decided to interrupt her own channel's live evening news broadcast, walking across the set with a sign reading “no war” and “Russians against the war.” In Russia, where President Vladimir Putin has an iron grip on power, and his critics often wind up killed or in jail, this was a risky protest. The Russian government recently passed a law threatening up to 15 years of jail time for publishing news that runs counter to the Kremlin's war messaging, which denies that a ""war"" is even taking place. She has already been arrested and fined, and she is reportedly being investigated under the new draconian censorship law. ""This protest was a spontaneous decision for me to go out live on air, but dissatisfaction with the current situation has been accumulating for many years, because the propaganda on our state channels was becoming more and more distorted,"" Ovsyannikova said Sunday. ""And the pressure that has been applied in Russian politics could not leave us indifferent. When I spoke to my friends and colleagues, everyone, until the last moment, could not believe that such a thing could happen, that this gruesome war could take place."" She said she could ""see what in reality was happening in Ukraine, and what we showed our programs was very different from what was going on in reality."" Ovsyannikova said she hoped her protest showed to the world that ""not all Russian people"" support the war. ""Maybe half of the people in Russia are against the war,"" she said, adding that many of them are suffering amid the West's severe economic sanctions. ""It's Putin's war, not [the] Russian people's war,"" she said. Despite the risks she faces in Russia, Ovsyannikova also said she is staying in her home country and has rejected French President Emmanuel Macron’s offer of political asylum. ""I am very worried about the safety of my children, first and foremost. And I am very grateful to Mr. Macron for his offer, but I have publicly refused to take political asylum in France, because I am a patriot. I want to live in Russia. My children want to live in Russia,"" she said Sunday on ABC.",World/Yahoo News,Russian TV protester Marina Ovsyannikova: State propaganda 'becoming more and more distorted',https://news.yahoo.com/marina-ovsyannikova-protest-152226063.html

3/21/2022,"The D.C.-based Institute for the Study of War concluded that ""Ukrainian forces have defeated the initial Russian campaign of this war,"" in an assessment published Saturday, The New York Times reported. The assessment argues that Russia had failed in its initial goal of swiftly capturing Kyiv and other major cities and toppling the Ukrainian government and that Russian forces ""are very unlikely"" to capture these major objectives if they persist in their present strategy. ""The doctrinally sound Russian response,"" the assessment concluded, would be for Russian forces to pause and regroup instead of ""continuing to feed small collections of reinforcements into an ongoing effort to keep the current campaign alive."" United States Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin made similar comments in Bulgaria on Saturday. ""I think [Russia] envisioned that they would move rapidly and very quickly seize the capital city. They've not been able to do that,"" he said, according to CNN. In an address to the nation delivered Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said over 14,000 Russian troops have been killed since the invasion began on Feb. 24. The U.S. estimates Russian military deaths at around 7,000. ""In places of especially fierce battles, the frontline of our defense is simply piled with the corpses of Russian soldiers,"" Zelensky said. Kori Schake, the director of foreign and defense policy at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, wrote in The Washington Post on Thursday that the ""deficiencies of the Russian military are exacerbating the damage and risks of the war."" Schake argued that ""Russia's first resort to overcome inadequacies has been to shift its focus from attacking military forces to targeting civilian populations indiscriminately."" As of Saturday, the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights was able to confirm that 847 Ukrainian civilians have been killed in the fighting, though the report also says the ""OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher.""
