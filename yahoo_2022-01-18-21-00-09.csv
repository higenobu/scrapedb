1/18/2022,"Supporting our local police officers (and other first line responders) is something we believe in. We have, and have had, acquaintances on the York Police Department, past and present. Their dedication to worthy causes over the years, keeping our kids engaged in the spirit of community, and working hard on their behalf to keep York safe has been reassuring to us. Honestly, in today's environment, we cannot help but wonder how difficult it is to work in law enforcement. Two years ago, we learned of Dr. Stephen Brennan's unfortunate encounter with officer Jonathan Rogers and heard what transpired for him thereafter. Dr. Brennan was a terrific pediatrician for our children, there from the get-go for all of them, from their births at York Hospital on up through their teenage years. I remember early days of motherhood, being overwhelmed, and he was there to say it was OK and hand over a tissue. I also recall the ""Happy Birthday"" song he sang at the kids' well-checkups, the assurances, diagnoses, incredible care given. He had a wonderful staff who cared equally as much. We were always grateful. We love Dr. Brennan. Watching the appalling video recently released has been upsetting at the least and shocking in its brutality. The officer and his K-9 were aggressive from the start. Officer Rogers proclaimed to responding officers that Dr. Brennan came ""charging"" at him. Is that true? Dash-cam footage: York police release video of K-9 taking down pediatrician, 63, during traffic stop The situation appeared to rapidly escalate into something horrific and potentially deadly ... for flashing high beams? Hindsight is 20/20. Getting out of his stopped vehicle may not have been the best idea for Dr. Brennan, but what ensued was a vicious attack after he was already on the ground. We remain hopeful for positive change in police de-escalation tactics and progressive training opportunities. We wish Dr. Brennan the best as he moves forward. — Joyce Lehan, York After watching the video of York Police officer Jonathan Rogers, who stopped Dr. Stephen Brennan for allegedly flashing his high beams, I felt a duty to respond as a parent and educator who resides in the town of York. I recognize the danger our police officers face daily, and we’re fortunate to have so many professional and caring officers protecting our community. However, what I saw in this video footage was gut-wrenching. It clearly shows officer Rogers using an overabundance of force, after Dr. Brennen was on his knees with his hands up, surrendering. A man who made the mistake of leaving his vehicle during a traffic stop does not justify the abuse he suffered from a police K-9. It’s clear to me that Rogers was only protecting his ego by using this level of force and power, rather than protecting our town. What concerns me most about this situation is the fact that this very well could have been a teenager. If officer Rogers is willing to use this kind of force on a 63-year-old man, what would he do to a teenager who makes a similar mistake in the heat of the moment? I am a teacher in another community and I have two young children of my own. I fear what would happen if an inexperienced driver made the slightest mistake in the presence of officer Rogers. I have the utmost respect for the police, and I know children look up to police officers as people who will help and protect them. We’re fortunate to have an otherwise stellar police force in York to protect our community, but officer Rogers' actions, lack of reflection and lack of remorse suggest to me that he’s not a protector of our community’s safety but a threat to it. — Stephanie Cleary, York This Thursday, Jan. 20, marks the one-year anniversary since President Biden gave his inaugural address in which “Unity” was the central theme. It was a pretty good speech, in which he used the terms “unity,” “together,” and “as one” at least 19 times in 21 minutes. He told us that “We can join forces, stop the shouting and lower the temperature” and added “For without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury.” It all sounded great, but as happens more often than not, turned out to be empty political rhetoric. Last week while stumping in Atlanta to pass his “voting rights” agenda, he bitterly shouted at those of us who oppose his bills and his new desire to eliminate the Senate filibuster, and labeled us all domestic enemies and racists, in the same mold as Jefferson Davis, Bull Connor and George Wallace (coincidentally all Democrats). Somehow one of the most racist, prominent politicians of the last half century, who has authored numerous pieces of major legislation which have devastated minority communities, and whose list of racist comments would make even Archie Bunker blush, has been given a pass by his party and the legacy media, and now passes himself off as a crusader for racial justice. Never mind that in 2020 the Democrats used the filibuster 327 times and Republicans only once. Suddenly now it has become a “Jim Crow relic” which has been “weaponized and abused.” Mr. President, it’s time to listen to your own message; leave the filibuster alone! Laws should be difficult to pass, and should require both sides of the aisle working together to get things done, not just the swaying of a couple of fringe members from either side; 75-80% of the American public favor voter I.D. requirements; please don’t change a longstanding Senate institution to pass something Americans don’t want, and stop labeling those of us who oppose your policies as racists. We as Americans, together, are better than that. — Charlie Black II, York Complicated impacts: 1994 crime bill did not bring mass incarceration of Black Americans I watched the newly released video footage of the York Police officer who stopped Dr. Stephen Brennan for allegedly flashing his high beams at him. There is nobody on the Seacoast who is more pro-police than I am! But, this officer from York grossly overreacted, committed assault with a deadly weapon (the police K-9). He subjected this man whose hands were in the air and who was not a threat to this officer’s safety or that of the public to an assault. The incident: York police release video of K-9 taking down pediatrician, 63, during traffic stop This police officer was totally out of control, told fellow responding officers outright falsehoods about what Dr. Brennan did or did not do before their arrival. Further his K9 was not trained properly and basically ate up this man’s leg all the while being watched and praised by the York police officer. For me, I used to love going to York for stores and restaurants all my life, but now I am going to avoid even driving anywhere near the borders of York, Maine so long as this officer is out on the streets. he police chief is as much at fault as his officer and any review board at a State Police level or Court would conclude the same thing I do. The settlement: York pays pediatrician $325K following attack by police dog during minor traffic stop Citizens and residents, you are at serious risk of bodily injury and false arrest should Officer Rogers place you in his crosshairs. In my 58 years of life, I have always considered a police officer as a “friend” and someone whom you can trust and look up to. his is why I support my local police department always. Now that I have seen this dash cam footage for myself, there is absolutely no doubt I would be scared out of my wits to get close to York, Maine, with this overzealous police officer on the road with that dog that was not trained at all. — T.

1/18/2022,"The former head of New York state's university system officially left office last week after authorities released evidence as part of an investigation into former Gov. Andrew Cuomo that revealed text messages about a former aide who accused the governor of creating a toxic workplace. Jim Malatras announced his resignation as chancellor of the State University of New York (SUNY), in December after the profane messages were released by the office of state Attorney General Letitia James. The revelation came amid sexual harassment allegations against Cuomo, a Democrat. The governor resigned in August 2021 following accusations from 11 women who claimed he sexually harassed them. Malatras officially stepped down on Friday. CUOMO TEAM LAYING LEGAL GROUNDWORK TO CHALLENGE ORDER REQUIRING HIM TO PAY BACK $1.5 MILLION FROM COVID BOOK The former chancellor allegedly engaged in a heckling campaign against former Cuomo aide Lindsay Boylan when he worked in the governor's Executive Chamber following her complaints of a toxic workplace environment. In a private exchange with members of the Executive Chamber, Malatras wrote, ""Malatras to Boylan: Go f*** yourself."" In other messages, he told staff he wanted to ""drive her nuts"" and suggested they should ""release some of her cray [sic] emails."" In his resignation letter, Malatras said he had ""no other higher calling in life"" than being chancellor of SUNY. He said the events surrounding him had become a ""distraction."" A spokesperson for SUNY did not have any information on what kind of financial package he left with. Deborah Stanley, former president of SUNY Oswego, has taken over as interim chancellor. As the calls for Malatras' resignation grew, Boylan and other critics also took aim at Cuomo's successor, Gov. Kathy Hochul, for failing to help remove Malatras from his powerful position. ""This is shameful @KathyHochul - particularly since you and your staff know exactly who @jimmaltras is and the harm he has done to so many,"" Boylan tweeted. In announcing Malatras's resignation, the SUNY Board of Trustees said the former chancellor's leadership helped the higher education institution ""thrive"" while serving nearly 400,000 students at 64 campuses. ""He has been a champion for our students, for access, for equity, and for deeper public investment in this great institution,"" the board said. ""The entire board expresses our gratitude for his dedication and leadership."" Fox News' Cortney O'Brien contributed to this report.

1/18/2022,"Humans generally aren't bothered too much with cold weather, as long as it is reasonable. Layers of clothing, insulation for the home, modern, well-stocked supermarkets and several semi-affordable sources of home heating energy allow us to survive even the most inclement weather. But what about wildlife? How can wild animals cope with such extended bitter cold conditions? Nature is generally a wonderful provider. She takes great pains, through the evolutionary process, to ensure that every species is capable of survival within the environmental niche it has evolved into. Either that, or nature will send that species into the oblivion we call extinction and tailor another to fill the void. That is the real meaning of ""survival of the fittest,"" and it is the most unbendable law of nature. Almost everyone knows that whitetail deer have ""hollow"" hairs that help them survive the cold. But not everyone understands how a hollow hair can perform that service. Dead air space, like the air trapped between the glass layers of a double-pane window or between the outer and inner walls of a house, is the key. Hollow hairs have still air inside that helps hold in warm body heat and keep out winter's chill. At the same time, the close-lying hairs trap even more air around them, adding to their insulation abilities. Deer, like many other woodland critters, also have the ability to store fat. When available food is inadequate for their needs, or when it becomes very cold, this fat reserve is tapped for additional food (heat) value. As long as the individual animals aren't unduly stressed by other animals such as coyotes or domestic dogs or by too many other deer competing for a limited amount of winter food, they will probably survive, and in relatively good shape. Deep snow is another matter entirely. Two feet of snow with a thin crust is enough to cause deer to ""yard up,"" or congregate together in groups of 10 to 50 or more animals. The yards are most often located in a sheltered area near good food supplies. However, if the deep snow persists and deer can't move, they begin to starve once the local food is exhausted. Deep snow can prevent them from moving to new feeding areas, even if they are only a short distance away. If deer are subjected to extremely harsh winter conditions, nature has another way of assisting in the doe's survival. If she was successfully bred during the fall rutting season, a winter-stressed doe will actually re-absorb the partially formed fetus of her fawn(s). While she won’t give birth in the spring, her body has the ability to turn her fetus into useful energy that could save her life. Wild turkey don't have the ability to store a lot of fat, so they must rely on a steady supply of food. And while they definitely prefer some food items over others, when the chips are down they will eat just about anything edible that they might find in their travels. It isn’t unusual to see entire flocks feeding in harvested crop fields, scratching for kernels of corn or other grains lost to the combine. Acorns are one of their favorite food staples. During a good ""mast"" year, when lots of acorns are on the ground, turkey can be found scratching under oak trees all winter long. They will also eat beech nuts when available, and ash seeds are another source of preferred wild food. Unfortunately last year was not good for mast crop production, so this winter could be very hard on wild turkeys and other wildlife species. There is one other food possibility for these big birds. Turkey will feed extensively on wild grapes and wild cherries if the mast crop fails. Actually there is a wide array of berry and seed producing plants they will seek out during lean times. They also look for insects, worms and grubs as they scratch in the forest litter. If the snow cover does not prevent that activity. Deep snow can have a devastating effect on turkey. If they can't walk and scratch, they have to sit. The wind generally blows some ridges bare of snow, but not always. Flocks of turkeys have been observed sitting in the same tree for more than two weeks without moving during inclement weather. But eventually they have to eat in order to survive the cold. If their internal reserves get used up before they can get to exposed ground, they will die. Extended periods of deep snow can be a killer on wild turkeys. People living in turkey country are often surprised to find a flock of these homely yet somehow noble birds scratching and feeding right under their backyard bird feeders. Wild turkey are also opportunistic when it comes to winter food. While they are normally shy birds and avoid human haunts like the plague, they will come to a bird feeder as long as they feel they are safe. But, if a human shows himself to them for even a fleeting instant, they might move off quickly, or they may just ignore the human and continue feeding. I’ve seen both several times. Some species like the woodchuck take the easy way out. Instead of struggling to find food during the winter, they (and some other species) hibernate for most or all of the winter. The deep sleep in an underground burrow is accompanied by greatly reduced body temperature and heart rate. Body fat supplies the minimal calories needed for survival under these condition, and usually there is still some fat left when spring arrives to aid the species with the stress of breeding and searching for some tender new shoots. Chipmunks hibernate, too. But while the woodchuck may awaken two or three times during the winter, chipmunks become active every week or so. During these periods they visit their larder of stored seeds and grasses for a mid-winter snack. Then it's bedtime once again until the next hunger pangs hit. Without any doubt the most efficiently insulated wildlife species has to be our local wintering waterfowl. Ducks and geese spend most of their time resting on water just a little warmer than ice. Sometimes they even sit on the ice to rest. And when they feed it is either in a frozen crop field or under the surface of that cold water. Nature has been kind to ducks and geese in the insulation department. A heavy coating of feathers, waterproofed by oil from a gland on their lower back, keeps wind and moisture away from the skin. A thick undercoating of fluffy yet efficient down feathers traps air (heat) next to the skin. That combination allows them to survive even the most frigid weather conditions. Food, especially for our local wintering ducks, can be a serious problem. Many of them have become accustomed to getting free handouts of goodies from good-hearted humans on the city pier and along lake shores. If that food supply doesn't arrive on any given day, they will still be sitting there waiting for it to arrive instead of looking for more natural aquatic food stuffs. The greatest disservice humans can show any wildlife is to get it accustomed to feeding only to suddenly stop that feeding. Wild birds and animals don't understand when the food they have learned to rely on suddenly isn't there any more. They will continue to come to the feeding site, spending valuable time just sitting around when they should be searching for other food sources. By the time they do start their search they may be too weak to survive. And please remember that it is illegal to feed deer at any time. People who have back yard bird feeders face the same problem. They must be dedicated and responsible. Once the feeding starts it can't be suddenly stopped. To do so would stress the birds that rely on that food. It is the human's responsibility to keep the food coming at all costs. Failure to do so, regardless of the reason, is a most inhuman act. Len Lisenbee is the Daily Messenger's Outdoor Columnist.
