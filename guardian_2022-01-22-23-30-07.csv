1/22/2022,"Leading campaign groups that have spent years tackling the growing problem of violence against women and girls are becoming increasingly frustrated with an apparent lack of action from the home secretary six months after the government announced a major strategy designed to tackle the issue. Despite the promise of a “radical programme of change” announced by Priti Patel in late July last year, campaigners say a number of central pledges have disappeared without trace, or have not been implemented, without proper explanation.  The strategy was announced against a backdrop of widespread calls for urgent and radical change following the murder of Sarah Everard, who was killed while walking home from a friend’s house in south London several months earlier. These calls were made again this month following the murder of schoolteacher Ashling Murphy in Ireland. The 23-year-old was attacked and strangled while out jogging on a canal path near Tullamore, County Offaly. Last Wednesday, a week after her death, a 31-year-old man was remanded in custody charged with her murder. Georgie Laming, campaigns manager at Plan International UK, whose campaign for public sexual harassment to become a specific offence has 500,000 supporters, said: “It has been six months since the home secretary promised a review into the legal gaps on public sexual harassment, and a decision on a new law to criminalise it. But we are yet to see any movement. Women and girls can’t afford to wait any longer.” Saskia Garner, head of policy and campaigns at the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, said: “We would welcome an update on all commitments made in the violence against women and girls strategy. All these issues urgently need to be addressed to ensure that the voices of women and girls experiencing devastating crimes including stalking and harassment are heard.” Another source said: “There is deep frustration over the apparent progress over elements of the strategy. “The fact is women are still being killed in high-profile murders every few months but there does not seem to be any burning desire to actually deliver key parts.” Chief among their concerns is the outcome of a legal review committed to by the Home Office into gaps in existing law and how a specific offence for public sexual harassment could address those. Sources say there is still no timescale for when the review is complete, or even if it will support calls for a new harassment offence. Campaigners also point out that a much-hyped information campaign targeting perpetrators of violence against women has yet to be launched despite hopes that it would be up and running before Christmas, a period when domestic abuse traditionally rises. In addition, women’s groups argue they do not know what has happened to a £5m “safety of women at night fund” or another £3m to “better understand what works to prevent violence against women and girls.” Questions also surround the StreetSafe app, which allows women to record where they feel unsafe, and which was the focus of a three-month pilot that ended in early December. More than 180,000 people responded to a consultation on the strategy, the vast majority after it reopened following Everard’s murder. A Government spokesperson said: “Since the launch of the strategy we have delivered several of its commitments, helping to tackle this horrific crime. For the first time ever there is a national police lead for violence against women and girls, we’ve implemented the landmark domestic abuse act, launched the safety of women at night fund and given out a further £25m for safer streets projects. We are also carefully considering the Law Commission’s recommendations on a specific public sexual harassment offence.” “We know there is more to do, which is why we continue to work closely with the women’s sector and academics on the national communications campaign, which will launch shortly.”",News/Society,‘We can’t wait any longer’: anger over Priti Patel’s ‘inaction’ on violence against women,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/22/we-cant-wait-any-longer-anger-over-priti-patels-inaction-on-violence-against-women
1/22/2022,"Writer and director Mariama Diallo’s debut feature, Master, explores the challenges faced by two Black women at a prestigious New England university that continues to be haunted by ghosts of the past, figurative and perhaps literal.  Gail Bishop (played by Regina Hall) has just been appointed the school’s first Black master, a prestigious faculty position overseeing a residence hall. (A holdover from elite British universities, it’s a glorified, proto resident advisor.) But the predominantly white (and fictional) Ancaster College, which is almost as old as America itself, has a dark past it can’t seem to shake, as the site of a Salem-era witch trial and hanging. According to campus lore, the witch now haunts the grounds, and as freshman Jasmine Moore (Zoe Renee) learns upon her arrival, her room in particular is said to be inhabited by a malignant force; the school’s first Black student killed herself there in the late 60s, she discovers. The pernicious specter of racism likewise hangs over the campus, rearing its head in places like the library (“Your family must be so proud of you,” a librarian tells Jasmine condescendingly, moments before searching her bag for possibly stolen books) and a house party, where a dancing crowd automatically congregates around Jasmine at the hint of a rap song. But the micro-aggressions eventually escalate from deep unease to downright hate, pushing Jasmine from disorientation to sheer terror. Meanwhile, Gail, once a full-throated advocate for the school, becomes increasingly aware of the impact of the institution’s unresolved past on the present, especially in light of a fellow Black professor’s bid for tenure. The moments of discomfort and careful navigation ring particularly true for anyone who has stood out in an overwhelmingly white (even seemingly well-meaning) space of privilege and had the majority make assumptions about them; in fact, Diallo drew on her own experiences as a student at Yale. (That university did away with the term master in 2016 in response to student protests.) And there are a lot of well-observed, telling details that pass by unremarked, as they would in real life: Jasmine straightens her hair soon after arriving; Ancaster’s custodial staff — silent, always in the background — are all Black; the Black cafeteria worker puts on a jovial, maternal mien for white students eager to gobble up her macaroni-and-cheese but gives Jasmine the cold shoulder. Not to mention some very timely conversations involving critical race theory and diversity efforts versus merit (and one fun diversity video full of token people of color, rattling off buzzwords à la mode). Hall, always a joy to watch, shows yet another, more subdued, side of her prodigious craft. But the film fails to build real suspense, and the scary scenes feel rote and often inelegant, like ticking off a college-horror-movie shot list: the flickering-lights-in-the-shower scene, the running-through-an-empty-campus scene, the slow ascent to the attic door ajar, the mysterious threats carved onto a door, the odd unexpected telephone call. None of the white characters feel remotely real: not the roommate in the Hamptons sweatshirt; not the ignorant British classmate who says smugly, “All that racial-dynamic stuff, we don’t have it back home”; not the professor who is relieved to see Gail at a party because it “could use a little more flavor.” Perhaps that’s intentional, but it all gloms on an inertness to the proceedings. Genre films help audiences engage with difficult real-life issues – they make the medicine go down, and the hope is that wider audiences find much in Master to ponder about how to deal with our painful history in order to move forward. As Gail puts it, “It’s not ghosts, it’s not supernatural, it’s America, and it’s everywhere.” Master is showing at the Sundance film festival and will be released on Amazon later this year",Arts/Film,Master review – racism haunts a New England university in uneven horror,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/22/master-review-racism-haunts-new-england-university-uneven-horror
1/22/2022,"Towards the end of Colossus, Idles’ hulking opening number, frontman Joe Talbot orchestrates a moshpit, ordering the crowd to carve out a no man’s land down the middle of the venue. “Are you ready to collide?” he roars. Then, more vehemently: “Are you ready to look after each other?” This combination of violence and compassion is Idles in a nutshell: go wild, be kind. Their shows feel like being punched and hugged at the same time.  Successful paradoxes always intrigue. The Bristol-born band have the brawn and dread of post-punk heavyweights such as Big Black or the early Bad Seeds, but none of their seething malice. Instead, and despite their musical differences, they recall the hoarse idealism of the Clash or 1980s U2: a life-and-death desperation to communicate, and to commune. It’s why they can fill Brixton Academy four nights in a row, and why many of the fans there have committed to inking the band’s name into their skin. Like no other British rock band of their generation, Idles offer a sense of resilient belonging, rendering pain fertile and ugliness majestic.  They have never sounded better. Talbot’s urgent sincerity, striking each syllable like he’s banging in a nail, is better suited to autobiography than explicit protest. After the humanitarian politics of their first two records, the brute-force sloganeering of 2020’s Ultra Mono landed awkwardly, he has admitted, because it was designed for live performance just before the pandemic rendered gigs impossible. While strength-in-numbers rallying cries such as War and Grounds certainly take off (“two fucking years we’ve waited for this,” Talbot says with unleashed glee), Idles’ latest album, Crawler, digs more fruitfully into personal struggles, specifically the singer’s 18 years of on-off addiction to alcohol and drugs. “This song, and most of our songs, is about drug addiction,” he jokes by way of introduction to Meds, one of several numbers elevated by Colin Webster’s saxophone agonies. Now lean and sober, Talbot has the energy of a preacher who teaches kickboxing to young offenders. When he’s not stepping on a monitor, leaning as far forward as gravity will permit, he’s prowling the stage in front of a barricade of amplifiers or jogging on the spot. When he cries: “Can I get a hallelujah?” in The Wheel, a fraught song about inherited alcoholism, he could be at the pulpit; for Mr Motivator (“You can do it/ Yes you can!”), he’s Henry Rollins reborn as a personal trainer. The frontman’s sharper edge translates to the whole band. Once known for crowdsurfing, semi-nudity, tears and looming chaos, Idles have solidified into a formidable machine. They can execute ramalama anthems such as Danny Nedelko as well as anyone, but Crawler has broadened their horizons, from the bug-eyed, 30-second blurt of Wizz, its lyrics collaged from text messages from Talbot’s former drug dealer, to the nauseous, waltz-time soul of The Beachland Ballroom, and the hip-hop-adjacent stomp of Car Crash. Guitarists Lee Kiernan and Mark Bowen are as interested in noise as they are in riffs, and the best tracks attain an immense industrial clamour: the dank clang of Bowen’s guitar paired with drummer Jon Beavis’s rattling suspense on Colossus, or the climax of Never Fight a Man With a Perm, which roughly approximates the sound of a helicopter lifting off from the roof of a collapsing building. Add a bank of machine-gun strobes, and the impact is physically overwhelming. Idles’ particular brand of solidarity-building requires enemies, so there is indignant Tory-bashing (“there’s no point booing because none of them are here”) and a slightly jarring (but then I would say that) dig at “pseudo-intellectuals masquerading as journalists”. Perhaps the rather tedious class-policing allegations of inauthenticity that came their way a few years ago still rankle, but it’s hard to hear Talbot’s lacerating accounts of addiction and grief and question his bona fides. Then again, he wouldn’t be the first musician to draw strength from a sense of being disdained and misunderstood. A band like Idles needs pricks to kick against. A case in point is I’m Scum, which weaponises derision into defiance. Talbot commands everyone in the venue, band included, to “get low” before springing up in unison for the finale. It’s a thrilling, hilarious moment that sums up Idles’ inspirational appeal to their tribe: you get knocked down, you get back up again. “Do not go gentle,” Talbot says, quoting Dylan Thomas before the final song, as if there were ever any danger of that.",Arts/Music,Idles review – like being punched and hugged at the same time ,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/22/idles-o2-brixton-academy-london-live-review-crawler-like-being-punched-and-hugged-at-the-same-time
1/22/2022,"I don’t have many memories of growing up in Somalia – I was so young. I remember coming to the UK, age eight, going to school – even though I couldn’t speak any English – and suddenly having all these friends to play with. I owe a lot to my PE teacher, Mr Watkinson. He saw me running around the playground, he watched me run in a figure of eight around the gym. Then he thought: “That kid is good at running.” He encouraged me to join a local running club. We’re still in touch.  I lived with some Kenyan runners in the early 2000s. They didn’t have a social life. All they did was eat, train, sleep. I realised then that I needed to eat, train and sleep like them if I wanted to be the best. Winning the Olympics in front of my home crowd in London was incredible. Everything that led to it – my training, my mindset – it all made sense. People who saw it on telly probably didn’t think about how long it took to get there. What I achieved didn’t happen overnight. It took years. I’m very disorganised at day-to-day things, but I’m getting better. It’s easy as an athlete to train and not worry about anything else. But I’m working hard to become a bit more involved with my kids. I think I can still beat them in a race, but it depends what distance. My son is pretty quick. I’m getting back into running after my injury [Farah suffered a stress fractured ankle in the summer of 2020]. When I get fitter and stronger, I can see how much I can do. I hope to make the marathon. You’ve got to enjoy the moment and enjoy what you do. So I hope to keep competing and keep smiling. Lockdown was tough for all of us, but it made everyone realise what’s important in life – and that’s family. I would have loved to play for Arsenal, but I was never good enough. I played at school and for the local club until I was 14, but I was only good because I could cross the ball and run forward and run back. I didn’t have any other skills. I joined a running club instead. It is nice to see so many people getting out of the house, going for a run, for walks, out on bikes. Running clears the mind. It’s easy to sit at home and feel sorry for yourself. It’s like when you’re driving and feel tired, the best thing to do is open the window and get some fresh air. When you’ve been indoors too long, some fresh air relaxes you. If I run along the Thames or around Richmond Park, usually someone will go “That’s Mo!” and come and race alongside me for 20 or 30 seconds. My wife often says she needs to go for a little jog – and she jogs a little. You’ve got to just keep going at your own pace. How often do I shave my head? Every three days.

1/22/2022,"Councils across the UK are using radical strategies to cut the number of polluting vehicles on their streets in response to the climate emergency. Leicester city council hopes a new charge on workplace parking will improve air quality, fund public transport and incentivise walking and cycling.  The power to raise a “workplace parking levy” (WPL) from local businesses was introduced by Labour more than 20 years ago. But parking is such a controversial issue in local government that Nottingham is the only city in the UK with a scheme. Leicester is now set to become the second: it is consulting on proposals to charge companies with more than 10 parking spaces £550 a year per space from next year. It is up to employers to decide whether to absorb the cost or pass it on to their staff. It could raise £450m in the next decade to invest in a new fleet of electric buses, an expanded cycle network and train station renovations. Adam Clarke, Leicester’s deputy mayor for environment and transport, wants to use the workplace parking levy more broadly to move away from car dominance. Clarke said: “We’re a historic city. The road network has been built on a Roman footprint and it suffered from making way for the motor car in the postwar period, which attracted more cars, which has constrained the city. “We have worked really hard to generate a shift to cycling, walking and the bus. But there needs to be more than a step change, there needs to be a real leap if we’re going to meet our environmental, economic and health challenges.” The plans have been condemned by some businesses, opposition councillors and motoring organisations. Nigel Porter, a Liberal Democrat councillor in Leicester, said: “The current proposals are just stick, there’s no carrot at all. If you were a nurse or a doctor you could be attending shifts at various times of the day or night – there isn’t always going to be a bus service for you. There appears to be an agenda [among] some members of the Labour party… they want to price people off the road.” Several local businesses described the WPL as a stealth tax that would “impose a big cost”, according to the council’s economic impact study, while one employer simply described the plan as “insane”. Clarke said the council wanted to work with employers to come up with specific solutions to gaps in the transport network, including demand-responsive buses and cycle storage. Others have expressed concern about the impact on low-paid workers. A spokesperson for the AA said: “Given that WPL when passed on to employees is a flat-rate local tax, it hurts lower-income workers more and disproportionately.” The council said employers may choose to charge higher earners more than low-paid staff if they passed on the fee. Leicester wants to emulate the “15-minute city” model championed by Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo, where all essential amenities can be reached within a 15-minute walk or cycle. It is a relatively compact city and a quarter of all car journeys are less than 1.25 miles, with the average journey 3 miles. Clarke said: “We know that most journeys in Leicester can be walked or cycled, we know there are huge opportunities to improve the public transport network. If we’re able to do that we’ll be able to provide real alternatives and then those that really need to use a motor car will benefit because there’s less traffic on the road.” A workplace parking levy is an increasingly attractive idea to local authorities which are short of cash and must meet difficult air quality targets in the next few years. Oxfordshire county council is about to launch a charging zone to cover Oxford city centre, while Cambridge and Bristol have also recently expressed interest. Workplace parking has become a contentious political issue in Scotland, where Edinburgh and Glasgow are exploring schemes. Labour and the Conservatives in Scotland have strongly opposed the plans, with Labour transport spokesman Neil Bibby recently branding it a “commuter tax” and a “shameless attack on workers’ pay packets”. Other councils have used clean air zones – where older, more polluting vehicles are subject to charges – to incentivise sustainable transport. London’s ultra-low emission zone has been running since 2019, and last year Birmingham became the second city to introduce a zone that which applied to private cars. However plans for a clean air zone in Greater Manchester have stalled, with mayor Andy Burnham demanding more funding from government to help people switch to greener vehicles. Nottingham’s workplace parking levy has been used to raise £83m directly since 2012, unlocking a further £600m of grants. It has had a small impact on commuters’ travel patterns, according to one academic evaluation, which found 8.6% of commuters had switched away from the car in part due to the levy. Sue Flack, who helped deliver Nottingham’s programme and now works as a consultant to local authorities, said: “As far as we can tell there hasn’t been an economic hit to Nottingham and many employers will say they like Nottingham because of its good transport links, although they won’t say they like the WPL. “They’d prefer to have the transport and not the levy but it doesn’t work like that.”",News/Environment,Tax on parking: UK cities to impose levy on cars in bid to cut pollution,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/22/tax-on-parking-uk-cities-to-impose-levy-on-cars-in-bid-to-cut-pollution
1/22/2022," It costs over $100,000 a year to attend the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. I don’t know what you get for that money exactly but insights into the everyday economy clearly aren’t on the syllabus. Nina Strohminger, an assistant professor at Wharton School recently asked her students how much they reckoned the average American makes a year. A quarter of the class, she reported in a viral tweet, thought it was over six figures; one student thought it was $800,000. The real figure? Around $53,838, according to figures from the Social Security Administration (SSA) last year. Now, clearly, this is just an informal poll broadcast on Twitter; it’s not a peer-reviewed scientific study. Still, it touched a nerve with a lot of people because it’s a reflection of the fact that the super-rich seem to live on a completely different planet than everyone else. According to data from the New York Times the average family income of a Penn student is $195,500; 19% of its students come from the top 1% of earners while only 3.3% come from the bottom 20%. Wharton is the alma matter of people like Ivanka Trump and her father. Wharton is a place, to risk being somewhat over simplistic, that largely takes in people from rich families – these people then go on to become politicians and titans of industry and make even more money. If this poll just demonstrated that a few overprivileged students are incredibly out of touch that would be one thing. However, the myopia represented at Wharton is mirrored in society as a whole. As a Harvard professor noted in the Twitter thread, research shows that what you think others make depends on how much you make yourself. People tend to massively underestimate the gap between the rich and the poor. Want another example of this lifestyle-induced myopia? Last year, the New York Times asked the eight New York mayoral candidates how much they thought the median sales price for a home in Brooklyn was. Raymond J McGuire, an investment banker, reckoned “it’s got to be somewhere in the $80,000 to $90,000 range, if not higher”. Shaun Donovan, housing secretary under Barack Obama and housing commissioner under the former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, guessed it “at around $100,000”. The real answer? $900,000. It’s easy to laugh at these guys but, I can’t this stress enough, there is nothing funny about any of this. These people aren’t out-of-touch anomalies: the vast majority of the people running the world don’t live like the people they represent, and seem to have absolutely no idea of the issues regular people face. In the US, the majority of lawmakers in Congress are millionaires. Meanwhile in Britain, Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is an ex-banker who is worth hundreds of millions: much of this comes from his wife, who is richer than the Queen of England. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, meanwhile, once dismissed the £250,000-a-year ($284,000) he earned from a second job writing newspaper columns (lest you think this is normal for a writer, let me disclose that I get paid $500 for each Week in Patriarchy column), as “chicken feed”. “It’s hard to imagine these men solving a problem they don’t know exists,” said Monica Klein, a political consultant, to the New York Times, in reference to the mayoral candidates views on the Brooklyn housing market. And this, really, sums up the issue. Far too many politicians have no idea what it’s like to be unable to afford a house or to be swamped by student loans or bankrupted by medical bills. They have no idea about the problems the vast majority of Americans are facing – which is why none of these problems get fixed. Instead they spend their time on things that matter to people like them, AKA giving the rich bigger tax cuts. And this is a bipartisan issue, by the way: the second-most expensive component of the Democrats’ Build Back Better bill is a $275bn tax cut for people who pay large amounts of property tax that primarily benefits the top 10%. This tax cut is more costly than establishing a paid family and medical leave program. Every single crisis the world is facing is ultimately a crisis of leadership. As I write in my new book (sorry for the somewhat shameless plug), we have no hope of changing anything unless we change the people in charge. That doesn’t mean just sticking more women and people of colour in power: it means breaking down the barriers that stop regular people for running for office. It means having a government that actually represents its constituents. It’s supposed to honour the anniversary of Roe v Wade, the landmark abortion ruling. $25 of each sale will be donated to the American Civil Liberties Union foundation’s Reproductive Freedom Project. Gwyneth Paltrow better sell a lot of candles because the state of reproductive rights in the US has just gone from dire to extremely dire. On Thursday, the supreme court rejected an attempt by abortion providers to block Texas’ six-week abortion ban. “This case is a disaster for the rule of law and a grave disservice to women in Texas, who have a right to control their own bodies,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissent. The bad news is that women in America aren’t getting affordable childcare or paid maternity leave anytime soon. The good news is that Mars has given its M&M characters a makeover to promote inclusivity; the green one no longer wears high-heels she wears sneakers. So there’s that. That’s according to a report by Front Line Defenders and Access Now. “When governments surveil women, they are working to destroy them,” wrote Marwa Fatafta, a policy manager at Access Now, in a statement accompanying the report. “Surveillance is an act of violence.” Just when you thought NFT-mania couldn’t get any more inane. Mottley came to international attention last year when she gave an incredible speech at Cop26 and her government told the British monarchy that they could go get stuffed. Drones rarely feature in uplifting news stories but this week is an exception. A little dog called Millie that got stuck on mudflats was saved from drowning when rescuers attached a sausage to a drone and enticed her to freedom. “It was something we had never tried before,” a member of the search and rescue team said, “The sausages were the last resort.”",Opinion/Opinion,The super-rich live on a different planet.

1/22/2022,"The University of Rhode Island will revoke honorary degrees given to Rudy Giuliani and Michael Flynn, key allies of Donald Trump in his attempt to overturn the 2020 election.  The URI board of trustees on Friday voted unanimously to revoke the degrees, which were given to Giuliani in 2003 and Flynn in 2014. Giuliani’s doctorate of laws was given for his leadership as mayor of New York City after the 9/11 attacks, the Providence Journal reported. Flynn, a retired general and former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency who graduated from URI in 1981, was given a doctorate of humane letters. The trustees voted on the recommendation of the URI president, Marc Parlange, who said the two men “no longer represent the highest level of our values and standards that were evident when we first bestowed the degree”. Giuliani has acted as Trump’s attorney, work that led to the suspension of his law licenses in New York and Washington DC. A leader of legal attempts to overturn election results in key states, Giuliani spoke at a rally near the White House on 6 January, urging “trial by combat”. Parlange said Giuliani “encouraged domestic terrorist behavior aimed at preventing Congress from certifying the outcome of the 2020 presidential election”. Seven people died around the storming of the US Capitol. Trump was impeached but acquitted. More than 700 people have been charged. Eleven members of a far-right militia have been charged with sedition. This week, Giuliani was among Trump allies served subpoenas by the House select committee investigating the attack. Trump’s former adviser, Steve Bannon, has pleaded not guilty to a charge of contempt of Congress arising from a refusal to co-operate. Trump’s final chief of staff, Mark Meadows, could face the same charge. Leading Republicans in Congress have also refused to co-operate. On Friday, the Washington Post reported that a judge has released to prosecutors more than 3,000 of Giuliani’s communications, in an investigation of work in Ukraine which contributed to Trump’s first impeachment, for seeking dirt on rivals including Joe Biden. Flynn, who was fired from the Defense Intelligence Agency by Barack Obama, became Trump’s national security adviser before being fired for lying to the FBI about contacts with Russian officials. He pleaded guilty but was pardoned by Trump. A leading figure on the far right, he has advocated a military coup and the establishment of Christianity as the state religion. Flynn has been implicated in aspects of Trump’s attempt to stay in power including plans to seize election machines, the subject of a draft executive order revealed on Friday by Politico. He has resisted a subpoena from the 6 January committee. Also on Friday, the Guardian reported that law enforcement agencies have learned of an alleged plan by “allies of Flynn” to “gather ‘intelligence’ on top Republicans”, in order to compel them to back election audits in key states. Recommending the revocation of the honorary degrees, Parlange said: “As a civic institution, URI has the privilege and responsibility to sustain and preserve American democracy by insuring and modeling good citizenship. Revoking these honorary degrees reinforces our values and allows us to lead with truth and integrity.” The chairwoman of the URI trustees, Margo Cook, said the board “supports the university and its mission to uphold its values, especially its commitment to intellectual and ethical leadership and fostering an environment of diversity and respect”.",News/US news,Rudy Giuliani and Michael Flynn to see honorary university degrees revoked,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/22/rudy-giuliani-michael-flynn-honorary-university-degrees-revoked
