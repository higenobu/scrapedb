1/30/2022,"By Gaelen Morse MARYSVILLE, Ohio (Reuters) - Nine people have been sent to area hospitals from a Hampton Inn in Ohio after people fell unconscious or reported burning sensations in their throats, police said on Saturday. In a series of phone calls to police in Marysville, Ohio, people at the hotel initially said that a two-year-old girl was unconscious in the pool area, then that others had passed out while still more people reported burning in their throats, said Marysville Police Chief Tony Brooks. The hotel was evacuated, and a reporter on the scene said that firefighters had propped open a door and put an industrial fan in place. Six people were transported in critical condition to Memorial Health, a hospital in Marysville, said Brooks. One person in critical condition and two in stable condition were sent to Grady Memorial Hospital in Delaware, Ohio, said Brooks.

1/30/2022,"A Cincinnati-area venue has booted a scheduled rally featuring far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) following a surge of complaints, The Cincinnati Enquirer reported Saturday. Greene was promoted as a “special guest” at a gathering Sunday with Ohio Senate candidate and “Hillbilly Elegy” author J.D. Vance. The controversial lawmaker has endorsed Vance in his bid for the Republican nomination to replace retiring GOP Sen. Rob Portman. But the event was ejected from the Landing Event Center in suburban Loveland, Ohio, after a storm of complaints, venue general manager Jodi Taylor told the newspaper. Taylor said she had no idea the event would include Greene — and Vance was instructed to find another location. “We just chose to respect it was a very emotional topic,” Taylor told the Enquirer. “People are passionate about what they believe. We were wrapping our heads around what was going on. We didn’t know there would be a guest.” The Landing Event Center posted a politically neutral statement on Facebook, announcing the relocation of the event “due to tremendous interest,” and adding: “We appreciate everyone’s interest and concerns.” Taylor explained to the Enquirer: “It doesn’t matter what we do; we have both sides upset.” Vance’s campaign claimed in a statement to the newspaper that the event was moved to the Cincinnati Marriott Northeast in Mason due to a large number of RSVPs. Greene foes are now organizing against the event in Mason. The dust-up follows an awkward call-in show on a Georgia cable access station earlier this week when several people let Greene have it. One participant called Greene an “embarrassment to the state of Georgia” — and that was just the start.

1/30/2022,"A man allegedly responsible for more than half of all anti-Asian hate crimes recorded in San Francisco last year is reportedly out of custody, raising safety concerns across local communities.

Derik Barreto, 37, is accused of targeting 20 Chinese-owned businesses and seven others in Chinatown, the Ingleside neighborhood and the Ocean Avenue corridor between April and August of 2021. He allegedly rode on a scooter and used a slingshot, pipe or hammer to destroy the stores’ windows, as seen in several surveillance videos.

Following his arrest, the San Francisco District Attorney’s Office charged Barreto with a total of 33 crimes, as NextShark previously reported. Those included 27 felony counts of vandalism, four felony counts of second-degree burglary, one misdemeanor count of possession of burglary tools and one misdemeanor count of possession of a concealed weapon.

Of those charges, 31 had hate crime enhancements. Barreto allegedly made racially-charged statements to the police, who suggested that he targeted his victims, because they were Chinese.

This week, San Francisco city officials reported that anti-Asian hate crimes had increased by 567% from 2020 to 2021. Barreto’s 31 represented the majority of last year’s 60 reported hate crimes in total.

In September, a judge reportedly granted Barreto mental health diversion, and on Jan. 26 KPIX 5 reported that he is currently out of custody as he awaits a court appearance at the end of the month. His attorney, Pam Herzig, told KPIX 5 that he has pleaded not guilty.
 
 This all comes after 6/15 vandalism at Gai Chicken Rice in the Castro.

It’s unclear when exactly Barreto was released.

“Someone please help me understand what mental illness causes a 37-year-old man to vandalize 27 Asian-owned businesses,” one Twitter user wrote.

Another commented, “This scumbag career criminal is not even in jail after being caught in the act of damaging properties.”
  The news comes as community advocates have criticized the leniency of current criminal justice policies, including a 69-year-old Vietnamese American man who filed a federal lawsuit against the San Francisco District Attorney’s Office for allegedly filing a plea deal with his assailant without his knowledge.  In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul said she is prepared to use her powers to force Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg to reverse his lenient approach to prosecutions. Concerns over Bragg’s policies emerged in the wake of Michelle Go’s death, whose attacker was found to have 10 prior arrests.  “I have options, but I will be monitoring the situation very closely,” Hochul told the New York Post on Wednesday. “I know full well the powers that the governor has — I’ll be having a conversation very shortly to convey, to let him tell me what his plans are and make sure that we’re all in alignment.”  Barreto will reportedly return to court on Monday, Jan. 31.

1/30/2022,"MOSCOW (AP) — Russia says it will relocate naval exercises off the coast of Ireland after Dublin raised concerns about them amid a tense dispute with the West over expansion of the NATO alliance and fears that Russia is preparing to invade Ukraine. The Feb. 3-8 exercises were to be held 240 kilometers (150 miles) off southwestern Ireland — in international waters but within Ireland’s exclusive economic zone. Ireland is a member of the 27-nation European Union but not a member of NATO. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney this week objected to the war games, saying “This isn’t a time to increase military activity and tension in the context of what’s happening with and in Ukraine. The fact that they are choosing to do it on the western borders, if you like, of the EU, off the Irish coast, is something that in our view is simply not welcome.” Russia’s embassy in Ireland on Saturday posted a letter on Facebook from Ambassador Yuriy Filatov saying the exercises would be relocated outside of the Irish economic zone ”with the aim not to hinder fishing activities.” The decision was a rare concession amid the escalating tensions surrounding Russia's massing of an estimated 100,000 troops near the border with Ukraine and its demands that NATO promise never to allow Ukraine to join the alliance, stop the deployment of NATO weapons near Russian borders and roll back its forces from Eastern Europe. The U.S. and NATO formally rejected those demands this week, although Washington outlined areas where discussions are possible, offering hope that there could be a way to avoid war. Russian President Vladimir Putin has made no public remarks about the Western response. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said it leaves little chance for reaching agreement, though he also says Russia does not want war. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Friday that Putin could use any portion of his force to seize Ukrainian cities and “significant territories” or to carry out “coercive acts or provocative political acts” like the recognition of breakaway territories inside Ukraine. Two territories in eastern Ukraine have been under the control of Russia-backed rebels since 2014, after Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine. A Russian lawmaker is encouraging residents of those areas of Ukraine to join the Russian army, a sign that Moscow is continuing to try to integrate those territories as much as possible. Viktor Vodolatsky said Saturday that residents in rebels-held areas in eastern Ukraine fear assaults by Ukrainian forces and that those who hold Russian passports would be welcomed in the Russian military. “If Russian citizens residing in the (territories) want to join the Russian Armed Forces, the Rostov regional military commissariat will register and draft them,” Vodolatsky, deputy chairman of parliament committee on relations with neighbors, told the state news agency Tass. Russia has granted passports to more than 500,000 people in the rebel-held territories. Vodolatsky said the recruits would serve in Russia — but that leaves open the option that they could join any future invasion force. A senior official in President Joe Biden's administration said the U.S. welcomed Lavrov’s comments that Russia does not want war, “but this needs to be backed up with action. We need to see Russia pulling some of the troops that they have deployed away from the Ukrainian border and taking other de-escalatory steps.” The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk publicly. Lavrov has said the U.S. suggested the two sides could talk about limits on the deployment of intermediate-range missiles, restrictions on military drills and rules to prevent accidents between warships and aircraft. He said the Russians proposed discussing those issues years ago, but Washington and its allies never took them up on it. He also said those issues are secondary to Russia’s main concerns about NATO. He said international agreements say the security of one nation must not come at the expense of others, and said he would send letters to his Western counterparts asking them to explain their failure to respect that pledge. Washington has warned Moscow of devastating sanctions if it invades Ukraine, including penalties targeting top Russian officials and key economic sectors. Lavrov said Moscow had warned Washington that sanctions would amount to a complete severing of ties. NATO, meanwhile, said it was bolstering its deterrence in the Baltic Sea region. Russia has launched military drills involving motorized infantry and artillery units in southwestern Russia, warplanes in Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea, and dozens of warships in the Black Sea and the Arctic. Russian troops are also in Belarus for joint drills, raising Western fears that Moscow could stage an attack on Ukraine from the north from Belarus.
