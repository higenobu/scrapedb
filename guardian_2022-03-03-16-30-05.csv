3/3/2022,"How do you evade a rampaging crocodile? By zigzagging as you run, according to Margaret Atwood, since crocodiles, apparently, struggle to navigate corners. It’s a piece of wisdom she imparts in passing in one of the essays in her latest collection. To be clear, the burning questions of the title are less to do with crocodiles and more concerned with those issues “we’ve been faced with for a century and more: urgent climate change, wealth inequality and democracy in peril”. The most serious questions of all, then. Still, the crocodiles are indicative of a sensibility that prevails throughout: droll, deadpan humour and an instinct for self-deprecation that saves the work from grandstanding or piety. The novelist’s essay collection has become a curious genre in recent years. Zadie Smith and Salman Rushdie periodically produce them to fanfare, but really there’s no reason for us to expect writers of fiction to be qualified to comment on fact. For every writer that proves themself a stylish and smart observer of reality, another dismays us with windbaggery and vanity. Atwood’s essays luckily escape that, but they do have the whiff of a publisher capitalising on the odds and ends that litter the successful writer’s desk – the keynote speech here, the guest lecture there. Still, there’s something cheerfully game about how politely Atwood thanks her hosts for their invitations to speak at the “Carleton School of Journalism and Communication”, “the Charles Sauriol Environmental Dinner” and the “Department of Forestry’s Centennial”. She’s both gracious and tongue-in‑cheek about the grandeur of these occasions. This is Atwood’s third volume of essays since 1960. It begins in 2004 and runs into 2021. As a summary of the travails of the millennium thus far, it’s a fair guide. She writes through the aftermath of the twin towers attack, the Obama years, the financial crisis, the Trump era, the #MeToo movement and the Covid-19 pandemic. There’s not a word on the double Booker stooshie of 2019, but there are other personal reflections, on the TV adaptation of The Handmaid’s Tale and the death of her husband, Graeme Gibson. Here, Atwood is generous and unguarded – exactly what you would hope of her. Some of the most interesting essays are about other writers – such as Rachel Carson, the marine biologist and author of the landmark environmental science book, Silent Spring, whom Atwood reveres. Canadian women get particularly tender consideration. In a piece on LM Montgomery, Atwood sensitively directs our attention not to the incorrigible, redheaded Anne of Green Gables, but to the unbending and overlooked Marilla who adopts her. Her 2008 essay on Alice Munro is the best thing you’ll read on the Canadian Nobel laureate. Munro, she explains, is not Chekhov, but Cézanne: “You paint an apple, you paint an apple over again, until this actually familiar object becomes strange, luminous and mysterious; yet it remains only an apple.” Exactly so. But Atwood doesn’t always stick to the script. When PEN International invite her to reflect on “the writer as political agent”, she demurs “because I don’t believe that writers necessarily are political agents”. To insist on such a thing “breaks the bond between the writer, such as me, and you yourself, Mysterious Reader”. Still, the question of how we write literature in the face of catastrophic climate disaster is a burning one. “The arts are not something separate from us, to be taken up and discarded at will … We are hardwired for them, you might say.” This isn’t an answer, but it is a pledge to keep looking for stories equal to our desperate situation. Sixty years since her first essay collection, Atwood seems here to be handing over the reins. “I’m an icon,” she says, and “once you’re an icon you’re practically dead, and all you have to do is stand very still in parks, turning to bronze as pigeons and others perch on your shoulders and defecate on your head”. It’s a characteristically dry remark, but it’s also a passing of the baton to “the post millennials” whom, she observes, will be soon in charge. “Let’s hope they use their power wisely. And soon,” she writes. Meanwhile, Atwood remains frank, honest and good company.  Burning Questions is published by Chatto & Windus (£20).

3/3/2022,"Early in the process of writing the film Wall Street, Oliver Stone found his drafts to be lacking in authenticity, so he sought out a guide to walk him through the wild world that was boom-time 1980s finance. The man Stone eventually found was an ideal guide, a cutthroat capitalist who bit everything but his tongue while antagonising the executives at the companies he took over – most times with hostility. This man not only greatly informed the character that became Gordon Gekko, but one of this man’s shareholder meeting harangues provided the skeleton for Gekko’s timeless “greed is good” speech. This man, as it happens, was Carl Icahn, the estimable financier and principal subject of Icahn: The Restless Billionaire – the HBO documentary that sifts for meaning in Icahn’s four decades-long impact on the American financial system. And while the connection to Gekko, which Stone himself reveals in the film, would appear intended to reinforce the popular perception of Icahn as a heartless one-percenter who only cares about the bottom line, the Restless director Bruce David Klein sets up the legendary wolf of Wall Street – whose worth is at least $17bn – as a paradoxical figure at first. On the one hand, explains the New York Times’ Andrew Ross Sorkin, who leads the parade of financial journalists who drop in throughout the film, if Icahn wasn’t the Street’s pioneering corporate raider, there’s no doubt he relishes playing the villain – one who openly boasts about firing “12 floors of people” and delights in openly sparring with fellow billionaire investors like Pershing Square’s Bill Ackman. On the other hand, Icahn could just as easily be called a corporate advocate for weeding the country club mentality from C-suites that too often hold companies back from performing to potential and posting returns. Just last week he framed the purchase of a small stake in McDonald’s as an effort to improve the treatment for the pigs the company sources for meat products. Whether he actually shares the passion his vegetarian daughter, Michelle Icahn Nevin, has for animals or is simply looking for another way into a big score remains to be seen. Far less dubious is the rationale for spending 100 minutes with the 86-year-old businessman whom one pundit affectionately calls capitalism’s “great white shark”. Immediately, you see how Stone could be inspired. Good or bad, the man is definitely a character. Where another billionaire might awe the viewer with the trappings of wealth, Icahn comes off as one of the residents at Del Boca Vista, the zany retirement community of Seinfeld lore. (The late oilman T Boone Pickens describes Icahn in the doc as “about as smooth as a stucco bathtub”.) Icahn trades volleys with his wife, Gail, on the tennis court and in every conversation. He ribs Michelle for treating him like a “moron” when she over-explains how to put on a set of headphones. He quotes Rudyard Kipling. And he tarries in his own resolved feelings about his parents, a reflex that seems about par for a middle-class Jewish kid from Far Rockaway, Queens – to say nothing of a marked betrayal of the slicked-back Gordon Gekko persona. Icahn’s fractious relationships with his parents don’t just go a long way toward explaining his closeness with Michelle and his son and heir apparent, Brett – the brains behind Icahn’s prescient investments in Netflix and Apple; it primes the portrait of Icahn as the ultimate outsider who came to dominate the game through hard graft, grit and brass-knuckled negotiating. (Gail is quick to point out that her husband isn’t motivated by money.) At first the game was poker (which paid his way through Princeton and made for a plush stay in the army). Then it was short-selling. Icahn is no less forthright about his inability to turn around TWA, a loss that still smarts. Never mind if in the grand scheme of the collapsing airline business, it hardly seems like much of a failure now. If anything, the TWA folly reinforces Icahn’s earlier assertions in the film about making money “because the system is bad, not because I’m a genius”. Still, he could have said more – a lot more – about his relationship with Donald Trump, whom he not only supported but advised for a time on financial regulation. But because Klein didn’t view the relationship as all that important, here Icahn happily holds his tongue. In the end, Klein’s film lands more like a love letter than an exposé. And given the degree of access Icahn granted him and his crew, it would have been a surprise if the final product turned out to be a withering critique of our corrupted financial system. And yet you can’t help but come away from the film feeling as if capitalism’s apex predator would have been game to make that movie. Instead, Icahn and his film make a compelling case as the victim of the grubby money-manager class he spawned. In a career that has seen the rise and fall of the junk bond trader Michael Milken, Bear Stearns credit default swapper Jimmy Cayne and Ponzi scheme king Bernie Madoff, Icahn at least can justifiably claim he might be the only honest dealer at the casino. You can’t call it greed. You can’t call it good either.

3/3/2022,"The most restrictive abortion law in the US has inflicted “devastating” consequences in Texas since it was introduced six months ago, according to healthcare providers and pro-choice groups. Senate Bill 8 (SB 8) bars the procedure once embryonic cardiac activity is detected, typically at six weeks of pregnancy or earlier, with no exception for rape or incest. As most people are not aware they are pregnant this early on, the unprecedented law amounts to a near-total ban. It also delegates enforcement to private citizens, in lieu of the state, encouraging anti-choice vigilantes to sue abortion providers as well as anyone who “aids or abets” care for damages of at least $10,000, creating a chilling effect among abortion supporters. Amy Hagstrom Miller, president and CEO of Whole Woman’s Health, which operates four abortion clinics in Texas, described the panic, fear and anguish of patients unable to obtain constitutionally protected healthcare in their home state. She said her clinic staff had transformed counseling sessions into trauma and grief support, coupled with travel logistics advice. “For six months we have heard the cries and pleas of Texans who have had their healthcare freedoms stripped away,” Hagstrom Miller said in a recent press briefing. “In many cases, there is nothing we can do for them other than listen, hold their hands and dry their tears.” Under SB 8, abortions in Texas have fallen by almost 50%. Texans have been forced to travel hundreds – or even thousands – of miles for abortion access, with an average distance that is 14 times greater than before, according to the Guttmacher Institute. This is only if they can find the necessary resources including time off work, childcare, lodging, transportation and others necessary to cross state lines. Some Texans are being forced to carry pregnancies against their will, providers say. They stress the impact of SB 8 falls hardest on low-income people and black and brown communities. “Senate Bill 8 has been absolutely devastating for Texas communities, especially for people who call on abortion funds for support,” says Amanda Williams, executive director of the Lilith Fund. Abortion funds that offer financial assistance to low-income patients and people of color said they were now spending “six times more” on travel expenses under SB 8 in a video detailing the impact of the law. Anna Rupani of Fund Texas Choice says the number of people leaving Texas for abortion care has risen fivefold among those they help. Similarly, Kamyon Conner of Texas Equal Access Fund reports 91% of those who call the non-profit are in need of out-of-state care. “People in this state are being forced to travel for healthcare,” Conner said. “We need the support of everyone in the country right now.” Planned Parenthood recently released new data showing a nearly 800% increase in Texas patients at their health centers in nearby states, including New Mexico, Kansas, Colorado and Missouri in the first four months of SB 8 compared with last year. Planned Parenthood clinics in Oklahoma alone saw a nearly 2,500% increase in patients from Texas. “These numbers are staggering and just one part of the devastating picture on the ground in Texas and the surrounding states,” said Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. “[T]he country’s most restrictive abortion ban has led to continued chaos and a sustained crisis for patients and providers in Texas and beyond. This reality is heartbreaking and a glimpse of what’s to come should the supreme court restrict the constitutional right to an abortion even further.” Clinics in neighboring states have become overburdened with an influx of patients, causing a ripple effect across the US reproductive health network. Kathaleen Pittman, clinic administrator at Hope Medical Group for Women in Shreveport, Louisiana, said in her 30 years as a provider she had “never been so afraid” for her patients, most of whom live at or below the poverty level. With a nearly 50% jump in Texas patients, the clinic is “overloaded” and cannot schedule appointments until one month out. “Our staff is exhausted and the phone calls are nonstop,” says Pittman. “Women are crying because they can’t understand how a state can have so much control over their lives.” Despite legal efforts from Texas abortion advocates, the US supreme court – now stacked with conservative anti-abortion justices – failed to halt the extreme measure on more than one occasion and has largely stripped providers of their power to challenge the law. In January, the conservative fifth circuit court of appeals asked the Texas supreme court to determine if narrow challenges against state medical licensing officials can proceed, and providers await that decision. However, they consider the move by the conservative fifth circuit an attempt to “further slow-walk the case” and allow SB 8 to remain in place indefinitely. “The supreme court greenlit this law’s unprecedented vigilante scheme and essentially said that federal courts are powerless to stop it. There is no end in sight to this nightmare,” said Marc Hearron, senior counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights and arguing attorney for the plaintiffs. “What is happening in Texas should be a grave warning for the rest of the country. This is a preview of what will happen on a much larger scale if Roe falls.” The US supreme court is poised to overturn or undermine the pivotal 1973 Roe v Wade ruling that guarantees the right to abortion care. The upcoming decision, in response to a 15-week Mississippi abortion ban, is expected in June. In addition to SB 8, Texas passed a “trigger law” that would automatically bar all abortion care if Roe falls. The Women’s Health Protection Act, a measure that would codify Roe into federal law – and potentially help Texans – was blocked by Senate Republicans on Monday. “This is a tragedy. Abortion providers alone cannot fix this,” Hagstrom Miller said of SB 8. “This should not be the reality of abortion care in the United States.”",News/US news,‘A grave warning’: six months of Texas abortion ban sow fear and anguish,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/03/texas-abortion-ban-six-months-grave-warning
3/3/2022,"Untrue claims about genocide and authorities in Kyiv supporting nazism are among the most common falsehoods pushed online amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict, according to analysis. NewsGuard, a US-based organisation monitoring the trustworthiness of news and information websites, said Russian state media sources are being joined by lesser known sites in pushing deceptive narratives. It published a top 10 Russia-Ukraine “war myths” including an “attack” on a chemical plant in eastern Ukraine and claiming legitimacy for the 2014 referendum on Crimea joining Russia. The warning came as Facebook and Instagram said on Monday they were blocking access to the Russian state media outlets RT and Sputnik across the EU. TikTok has followed suit, while YouTube has blocked the broadcasters on its platform in the UK and Europe and Twitter indicated it would block RT and Sputnik in the EU. NewsGuard said it had identified and is tracking 114 web domains including Russian state media sources such as RT, Sputnik and Tass but warned that websites with no direct links to the Kremlin are pushing false content on mainstream social media platforms. “Russia employs a multilayered strategy to introduce, amplify, and spread false and distorted narratives across the world – relying on a mix of official state media sources, anonymous websites and accounts, and other methods to distribute propaganda that advances the Kremlin’s interests and undermines its adversaries,” the analysis said. “Its government-funded and operated websites use digital platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and TikTok to launch and promote false narratives.” NewsGuard said the outlets pushing disinformation included anonymous websites, foundations and research websites with indeterminate funding. The major social media platforms have said they are on alert for disinformation linked to the Russian invasion. The owner of Facebook and Instagram, Meta, has launched a “special operations centre” to monitor content related to the week-long conflict, while Twitter said it has suspended more than a dozen accounts that originated in Russia. YouTube and TikTok have also said they are closely monitoring content related to the conflict. These are NewsGuard’s top 10 Russia-Ukraine “war myths” – followed by NewsGuard’s refutation: “Russian-speaking residents in the Donbas region of Ukraine have been subjected to genocide.” The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe has found no evidence of this. “Polish-speaking saboteurs attempted to bomb a chlorine plant in Donbas.” The video of the “attack”, for which there is no evidence, was recorded days before it is alleged to have taken place. “Ukrainian forces bombed a kindergarten in Luhansk, eastern Ukraine, on 17 February 2022.” The shelling came from Russian-separatist frontlines. “Russia did not target civilian infrastructure in Ukraine at the start of invasion.” One day after the invasion, Amnesty International documented at least three Russian military attacks on civilian areas in Ukraine. “Nazism is rampant in Ukrainian politics and society, supported by authorities in Kyiv.” The candidate for the far-right nationalist party, Svoboda, won 1.6% of the vote in the 2019 presidential election. “The west staged a coup to overthrow the pro-Russia Ukrainian government in 2014.” There is no evidence supporting the theory that the 2014 Maidan revolution in Ukraine was a coup orchestrated by western countries. “The US has a network of bioweapons labs in eastern Europe.” The claims are based on a misrepresentation of the US Department of Defense’s Biological Threat Reduction Program. “Nato has a military base in Odesa, southern Ukraine.” Foreign military bases are not permitted in Ukraine. “Crimea joined Russia legally.” The UN Assembly declared a 2014 referendum that backed Crimea joining Russia was illegitimate. “Modern Ukraine was entirely created by communist Russia.” Russia and Ukraine’s shared heritage dates back more than 1,000 years.",News/World news,Analysts identify top 10 ‘war myths’ of Russia-Ukraine conflict,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/03/russia-ukraine-conflict-top-10-war-myths-newsguard
3/3/2022,"You can stride energetically across lonely crags, declaiming in a grand Tennysonian voice about “always roaming with a hungry heart”, or you might shuffle up High Holborn, thinking of Celia with “nothing on”, as did Adrian Henri. Poetry walks take many forms: some places demand epic stanzas; others respond to limericks. You can walk for a few minutes, or weeks. The point is that walking with poetry is great fun. Maybe it’s the rhythm thing: our language must have been invented and honed by miles of walking. In fact, as soon as we were walking long distances and trying to remember routes, poetry probably began to be useful as a navigational mnemonic. Walking does lend itself perfectly to learning lines and recitation, something kids are good at and enjoy. John Cooper Clarke said you learn the lines at 12 and find out what they mean 30 years later (he also said “I hate walking”, but we’ll step over that). If there is a prepared route, fine. Some of these 10 suggestions have that, and others make use of existing footpaths, but they all share a link between landscape and poet. There are many more poetic walks available (try Simon Armitage’s brilliant Stanza Stones around the Pennine Way), but too few dedicated to female poets. Isn’t it time we had a Stevie Smith Way in north London, or a Barrett Browning Trail around Ledbury? The following collection features walks that are ready to roll, best done with headphones and an audio link to the poems where possible. Spotify has poetry from all these choices, sometimes read by the poets themselves. Other sources can also be found online. The best poetry walks match excellent verse, superb scenery and a good footpath, but there is an extra element that helps too: historical resonances. The 400th anniversary of the Pendle witch trials in 1612 was the perfect pretext to devise this 48-mile hike across Lancashire from Sabden via Pendle Hill and the Forest of Bowland to Lancaster. En route, Duffy’s atmospheric poem is inscribed on 10 posts. Here, heavy storm-clouds, ill-will brewed,Over fields, fells, farms, blighted woods.On the wind’s breath, curse of crow and rook.(from The Lancashire Witches) Arriving in Lancaster, check out the castle where the witches were tried, then walk the half mile to The Golden Lion pub where the poor unfortunates had their last drop to drink.

His voice, grim with good-humoured contempt, has often nailed down Salford. Get the train up to Clifton, north-west of Manchester, then follow the Salford Way long-distance footpath as it niggles its way south along the banks of the River Irwell to Salford Quays. Take a spur up Great Cheetham Street. This land has Cooper Clarke’s cuban heels all over it. He grew up on the corner of Bury New Road. His secondary school was here: “It was quite tough,” he once said. “We had our own coroner.” Take a right and another down Camp Street, the greasy star of the poem Beasley Street (and its gentrification-skewering follow-up Beasley Boulevard). In the cafes of the Quays, take a seat and look up some other local alumni: Lemn Sissay, JB Barrington, Longfella and Mike Garry.

With the Seamus Heaney HomePlace centre in the village as a starting point, head down to Poet’s Corner coffee house and turn right past Bellaghy Bawn where there is a statue, The Turfman, inspired by Heaney’s poem Digging. From there it’s a half mile down to Lough Beg where a boardwalk takes you along the shore. In summer, when it’s dry underfoot, you can get out to Church Island, reputedly visited by Saint Patrick on his way down the River Bann and mentioned in Heaney’s poem The Strand at Lough Beg.

His collection Pansies was seized by Scotland Yard in 1929 and had to be privately printed after being smuggled into Britain. Arguably his best poetry is about nature, but not often the British kind: Hummingbird, Kangaroo and Snake are strange bedfellows on a stroll around Eastwood, Lawrence’s home town, but at least you get to wonder, in amazement, how these redbrick lanes spat out such a bright and shiny pip. The quick sparks on the gorse-bushes are leapingLittle jets of sunlight texture imitating flame;Above them, exultant, the peewits are sweeping:They have triumphed again o’er the ages, their screamings proclaim.(from The Wild Common) The start of any walk is the DH Lawrence Birthplace Museum in the centre, heading out to the various houses he lived in. A pint in the Sun Inn is a worthy literary objective as the pub appears in both Sons and Lovers and Lady Chatterley’s Lover. A two-mile extension gets you into High Park Wood alongside Moorgreen Reservoir, a walk Lawrence did many times to visit his close friend, Jessie Chambers, who lived at Haggs Farm.

For some, no doubt, the harsh critique remains true, but Hull is much altered since Larkin’s day (he lived there from 1955 until his death in 1985), and is slowly shaking off the legacy of being vandalised, first by the Luftwaffe, then by its own planning department. “I like it because... it’s on the road to nowhere,” said Larkin. Sexual intercourse began,In nineteen sixty-three,(which was rather late for me)Between the end of the “Chatterley” ban,And the Beatles’ first LP.(from Annus Mirabilis) Start at the poet’s statue in the railway station, then call in at the nearby Royal Station Hotel bar, a favourite haunt. From there, walk east to the City Hall, a memorable element in his poem Broadcast, passing many grand buildings, including Ferens Art Gallery – definitely worth a visit – before heading off into the superb old town with its famous street, Land of Green Ginger, and several fine Larkin-associated pubs.

Edward Thomas, Rupert Brooke and Robert Frost all stayed here in the years before the first world war, drawn by the bucolic splendour of the countryside, and the poets Wilfrid Gibson and Lascelles Abercrombie were both local residents. Frost and Thomas often walked together and Thomas’s indecision about which route to take inspired Frost to write The Road Not Taken. Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,And sorry I could not travel bothAnd be one traveler, long I stoodAnd looked down one as far as I couldTo where it bent in the undergrowth(from The Road Not Taken) Two eight-mile poetry walks have been devised around the area, one circling north towards the Malvern Hills past Frost’s house, the second east towards the Forest of Dean. The Daffodil Way is also recommended, especially in springtime. Frost encouraged Thomas to concentrate on poetry, not criticism, and it worked. Thomas’s classic burst of nostalgia, Adlestrop, was conceived during a railway journey to Frost’s house in Dymock in June 1914. His evocations of winter are great for long, frosty forays through the woods, “Out in the dark over the snow, The fallow fawns invisible go.” Walk: Daffodil Way and Poet’s Path I and II are about eight miles; map: OS Landranger 149 and 162Eat and stay: Beauchamp Arms (in Dymock) is a lovely pub but has no rooms; Three Choirs Vineyard, two miles from Dymock, has lodges and rooms (doubles from £165 room only) in a glorious setting. Come tourist bods of dear old Slough, have you never pondered how your dreary dive might take a bow, and cash in? But the Berkshire town has no Betjeman trail, perhaps still smarting from one of English literature’s greatest muggings. You have to go to Cornwall for a Betjeman trail, across the River Camel estuary from Padstow, where the poet laureate lived the last decade of his life, having spent boyhood summers here too. Those moments, tasted once and never done,Of long surf breaking in the mid-day sun.A far-off blow-hole booming like a gun.(from Cornish Cliffs) Start at Rock (where the Padstow ferry lands) and walk north along the South West Coast Path to Daymer Bay, “sand in the sandwiches, wasps in the tea”, then looping back to St Enodoc Church where Betjeman is buried, surrounded by the golf club links immortalised in poems such as Hon. Sec. and Seaside Golf: “Lark song and sea sounds in the air, And splendour, splendour everywhere.” There is a lot to enjoy along the way, from SSSI sand dunes to bronze age burial mounds and a holy well said to have been visited by Jesus.

Artist, engraver, poet, lunatic – if it was hard to pin down Blake’s genius in his own time, it’s just as hard to decide which “trail” should be his. London was his uneasy home for most of his life. You could walk from Tate Britain (after viewing his paintings) to St Paul’s along the Thames Path, then cross the Millennium Bridge and head north-east for Bunhill Fields, where he’s buried. And did those feet in ancient timeWalk upon England’s mountains green:And was the holy Lamb of God,On England’s pleasant pastures seen!(from Jerusalem) Blake was happier, for a while at least, when he moved to Felpham, near Bognor Regis, on the south coast, taking up residence in a cottage near the Fox inn. There’s a short walk that connects the cottage, Hotham Park and other landmarks. The house where Blake wrote his most celebrated poem, about building paradise in England, is permanently closed, awaiting funds for restoration.

The two places are actually only about a mile apart as the crow flies. In between you get the Jurassic coast, Corfe Castle, Lulworth Cove and plenty of fine ridgeways, woodlands and rivers too. Had I but lived a hundred years agoI might have gone, as I have gone this year,By Warmwell Cross on to a Cove I know,And Time have placed his finger on me there(from At Lulworth Cove a Century Back) Better known for his novels, Hardy actually gave up writing anything but poetry over his last three decades and published more than 900 poems in his lifetime. References to the landscape and rural life abound in classics such as Wessex Heights, A Sheep Fair and Afterwards, but it’s Hardy’s bittersweet tone and sceptical outlook that separate him from his contemporaries.Walk: 217-mile circuit.

Before the first world war, it was Edward Thomas who did more than anyone to promote this unusual poet, writing about Davies: “In subtlety he abounds, and where else today shall we find simplicity like this?” The Autobiography of a Super Tramp (1908) made his name, followed by A Poet’s Pilgrimage (1918), an engaging picaresque stroll around South Wales. What is this life if, full of care,We have no time to stand and stare.No time to stand beneath the boughsAnd stare as long as sheep or cows.(from Leisure) It would be difficult, if not suicidal, to replicate the same journey now, as Davies used the main roads, but his literary technique wears well: walk all day, reach a town and head for the pub(s), engage locals in conversation and write it down. Better to use the coastal footpath these days: start from Carmarthen and head for Laugharne, stopping if you require in Llansteffan and St Clears.

3/3/2022,"“If someone deletes their comment, that’s success for me,” says Andrew Tierney. “Hopefully, that person will think about what they’re saying in the future.” Tierney, who goes by the name @cybergibbons online, is part of a new breed of cycling activists. After noticing an increase in the amount of abuse and violent threats on social media directed at people who ride bikes, Tierney decided to take action. He started calling out the posters online, with the result that many deleted their comments or even their accounts. “If someone says something racist [online], on the whole, people will challenge those views,” he says. “It should be the same for threats made against cyclists; challenge those who make these statements.” There has been a noticeable increase in virtual threats against cyclists since the Highway Code changes and clarifications have been in the news, Tierney believes, and he has started responding to the most serious ones. “It was on TikTok that I suddenly thought: ‘Wow, people think it’s socially acceptable to make [comments about harming cyclists]’,” he says. “A user made a comment about harming cyclists if they saw them adhering to one of the new Highway Code rules, and it got lots of likes.” Getting such a post taken down can be difficult and slow when reported via the tech platforms, but can be easy and swift when contacting the user directly, Tierney says. He was shocked to discover that many of those making hateful comments use their real names. “You click on their profile picture, and it’s their normal account; there’s no hiding involved,” he says. “There can be videos of them with their kids, yet they’re making a statement that they want to go out and harm someone, and they think that this is completely acceptable because it’s a comment about cyclists. That genuinely shocked me.” Tierney has nearly 38,000 followers on Twitter and is a recent returnee to cycling. “I got into cycling again during lockdown. I realised how cycling had changed; it’s now a lot more popular than I remembered from my university days. “By and large, the cyclists I see on the roads follow the Highway Code, taking the lane where it’s appropriate, for instance. But a lot of drivers seem to take issue with cyclists doing that. “I started noticing people casually posting on social media that they would run over cyclists next time they see any ‘hogging the road’, even when cyclists taking the lane are doing something that’s completely legal and always has been. That blew my mind.” It's honestly brilliant how many people delete comments about running over cyclists when you tag their wife and mum. Tierney believes poisoning the online well can have real-world effects. “Someone stating on social media, ‘Let’s run over cyclists’ can make other people think it’s acceptable to intimidate cyclists in real life,” he says. “Some of the hate comments are supposed to be jokes, probably done for likes. But even if it is just a joke to the poster, people reading those comments might be encouraged to harm cyclists in real life.” He wonders how many close overtakes – so-called punishment passes – are happening soon after reading online comments raging against people riding bikes. “Many of the most aggressive motorists might have been radicalised online. The belief that [motorists] have more right to be on the road than cyclists isn’t hard to find.” Many of those posting threat-to-life comments are professional drivers, says Tierney. “They post pictures of their truck or put their employer in their profile. It’s shocking that someone who drives for a living jokes about killing cyclists and does so publicly.” Tierney’s takedowns involve contacting those spouting the hate, including sending messages to professional drivers. “I remind them that they’re representing their company,” he says. Offensive posts are often deleted after that contact, but if not, Tierney contacts the companies concerned. “Businesses should be made aware that their employees are threatening to harm people,” he says. He has no way of knowing if his emails to employers get results because the typical response is that the company is dealing with the complaint internally. Still, comment deletions are normal, and so are full account wipes, or the accounts are subsequently made private. “People seem to be surprised when you contact them after they’ve made some hateful comment, but I tell them I’m looking at things that have been said in public.” I'm using four fake Facebook profiles and one real one to challenge people around cycling.It's interesting how people respond to the different profiles.Seems far more likely that the women get condescending responses. Tierney says he does not identify or dox people. “There’s been a few accounts where I’ve posted screenshots of the comments made, but I don’t dox; I don’t include the account holder’s real name if they don’t use it online; I don’t think pile-ons help. I don’t harass these people, or want them to be harassed by others,” he says. “I don’t want to suppress people for having a different opinion; I’ve only contacted people who’ve made direct threats to harm. I’ve gone on social media and found people who are saying: ‘I’m gonna keep a tally of how many cyclists I’ve run over this year.’ I filter down to people making the most serious comments and then ask them whether they really mean what they wrote. This has caused a lot of people to delete comments and caused others to delete their accounts.” No, I don't accept that it's a joke. It's not a joke to me.Cyclists die at the hands of drivers who can't control their emotions.It might be a joke to you, but each time someone reads a comment like that, they think it's normal. It's totally unacceptable. Tierney says many of the most egregious abusers are easy to find making similar comments across multiple platforms. “It’s common to find that someone will be on Twitter, on Instagram, on TikTok, and on Facebook, using the same [social media] handle and making the same kind of hateful comments. It would be great if everybody challenged these comments when they see them,” Tierney suggests, but he admits this is not for the fainthearted – few of the replies he receives are timorous. “There is a hardcore who feel like they’re entitled to say they’re going to harm and scare cyclists. I think what I do is a fairly effective way of challenging these people.”",News/Environment,The man challenging anti-cycling trolls to change their ways,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2022/mar/03/anti-cycling-trolls-andrew-tierney-online-abuse
3/3/2022,"South-east Queensland residents have been urged to take shelter – some told to leave their homes immediately – as a precaution ahead of “extremely unstable” storms that could bring hail and heavy rainfall to areas still affected by severe flooding. Large parts of the region remain underwater and residents have barely started to clean up after floods which killed nine people and damaged more than 17,000 homes and businesses. Police are still searching for an elderly man who fell from a boat into the swollen Brisbane River near Breakfast Creek on Saturday afternoon. On Thursday, state authorities sought to clear schools from Moreton Bay, north of Brisbane, to Bundaberg, asking parents to pick up their children early, before the storms arrived. The Lockyer Valley town of Grantham, which flooded severely in 2011 and again this week, was evacuated on Thursday. All schools in south-east Queensland will be closed on Friday – except for the children of essential workers – and people across the region are being urged not to leave home unless necessary as a precaution. Authorities have also urged people to cease clean-up operations, as the forecast storms could pose renewed danger to communities where rivers remain flooded, and where residents are still counting the cost of damage caused by the “rain bomb” storm that lashed Brisbane and surrounds until Monday. “These are unprecedented times,” the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, told reporters on Thursday morning. “We are warning people that this is a serious situation. It is extremely unstable weather conditions. “I’ve lived in Brisbane essentially all my life and I haven’t seen storms and floods like this all being thrown at us at once.” The Bureau of Meteorology has said the conditions are “very volatile” and that storms would be “dangerous and potentially life-threatening”. Up to 150mm of rain could fall in some areas, heaped upon more than 1,000mm of rain during the past week in Brisbane and surrounds. Meteorologist Laura Boekel said that flooding over the past week meant waterways did not have “capacity to take on any more water”. “For today, the creeks are a real concern and a real focus because they are rising quickly,” Boekel said. “They cannot take any more rainfall. They are what we call saturated. “The severe storms are expected to continue into this evening, and we’re still expecting storm activity tomorrow and into the weekend. “With severe thunderstorms comes severe hazard and phenomena and that doesn’t just include the heavy rain, it includes the potential for giant hail, as well as damaging winds.” Deputy police commissioner Shane Chelepy warned people whose homes had been flooded: “there is a possibility your home will be inundated again”. “Please do not move back into your homes if you have been inundated. What we don’t want is for emergency services at midnight tonight needing to come back into those areas and evacuate you again,” he said. A “Mud Army” of volunteers helping residents to clear out flooded homes has been suspended until Saturday at the earliest, the Brisbane lord mayor, Adrian Schrinner, said. The decision to evacuate Grantham came after storms hit Brisbane and surrounds on Thursday morning. The Grantham catchment had more than 80mm of rain and authorities said sounding the evacuation siren in the town was “a precautionary measure”. The morning storm was short-lived, but dumped enough rain to prompt warnings that several river systems would flood. The Logan River catchment, south of Brisbane, and the Bremer River at Ipswich were both rising. Amid the fierce conditions, a seriously ill man was winched to safety from a cargo ship in the Brisbane harbour.",News/Australia news,South-east Queensland residents brace for more storms just days after severe flooding ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/03/south-east-queensland-residents-brace-for-more-storms-just-days-after-severe-flooding
