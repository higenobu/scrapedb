5/5/2022,"Spoiler alert: this article is for people watching Moon Knight on Disney+. Do not read unless you have seen episodes one to six. Like many commenters on last week’s recap, I really didn’t see episode five of Moon Knight coming. The emotional heft was not unwelcome after four episodes of largely knockabout fun, but that kind of exploration of familial trauma was unexpected, making for one of the best episodes of MCU TV, up there with the finest moments of WandaVision and Loki. While the quality couldn’t be denied, and it explained in granular detail why Marc is the way he is, those events didn’t do huge amounts for the plot. Yes, we saw Steven and Marc on the canal boat with a giant hippo getting their hearts weighed (there’s a sentence for you), Steven tossed overboard into the eternal sea, and Marc left to work out how to contact Layla – and free Khonshu. One thing I’ve also been thinking about since last week, which I couldn’t quite put my finger on while writing the recap: if Marc created Steven’s personality in order to block out the beatings from his mother and give him a happy childhood, why did Steven come out when his mum was banging on the bedroom door? Anyway, those minor gripes aside (and I’m sure someone will tell me if I’ve grasped the wrong end of the was-sceptre), I had high hopes for this finale. But I wanted a few things to happen, namely some kind of crossover with the main MCU. Not waiting for an Avenger to show up has been refreshing, but at least a nod to the wider universe is needed. And so to the episode. After Harrow shot Marc in Egypt, we had already seen what happened to Marc and Steven in the afterlife. Now we got to see the real version of events from Harrow’s perspective. “I’m sorry it had to be this way, Marc Spector, Steven Grant, whoever else might be in there. Sometimes we need the cold light of death before we can see reality.” As Layla looked on, horrified, Harrow made his first steps towards resurrecting Ammit, before Layla ran over to Marc’s body, where she found the golden scarab. Out on the highway, we saw the true power of Harrow’s new staff as Layla weighed up whether to tackle him, before Taweret, speaking through the various corpses strewn around the roadside, told her that rescuing Khonshu to resurrect Marc as their best bet of taking down the be-sandalled menace. The avatars’ reaction to Harrow’s arrival put paid to my theory about the Ennead being in on his plan, but thankfully, as Ammit rose up and began thanking Harrow for his service, although it was revealed that he sought death for the imbalance in his soul, rather than salvation, as I had assumed. We saw Layla snatch Khonhsu’s shabti and resurrect the ol’ big bird head. So good to hear F Murray Abraham’s voice again. More than 10 minutes in, we got to see Oscar Isaac’s handsome face for the first time (I’m not counting seeing him as a corpse), as he and Taweret gazed upon Aaru. “It’s so … quiet,” he said, seemingly on the brink of tears. It was short-lived, though, as he made a quick U-turn and dashed off to save Steven. “You came back, what the hell’s wrong with you?” he asked, waking up. Back in the tomb, Layla agreed to become Taweret’s avatar, it having been explained to her that the only way to defeat Ammit was with more avatars than were currently still alive. And so to possibly the season’s greatest moment, Layla bursting through a wall and unveiling her costume, complete with bronze wings and swords. Wrong continent, but I couldn’t help think of the Mysterious Cities of Gold, and I’m sorry to say, when she teamed up with Moon Knight to fight Harrow, I spent most of the scene wondering what their spin-off show would be called. Egyptian Falcon and the Lunar Soldier, anyone? Meanwhile, a supersized Ammit and Khonshu fought, in something reminiscent of a Godzilla monster smash, or a Power Rangers final battle, and, beautifully designed as Ammit was, I’m pleased that CGI-fest was relatively short. Also, while it would have made most sense for Marc to kill Harrow, I’m glad he didn’t commit that act, instead asking to be released from service. Having just about settled on what was happening with regard to the psychiatric ward and Duat, we found ourselves back in Dr Harrow’s office (my best guess here is that in being released from Khonshu’s service, Marc is dead in reality, and in the Duat again). After last week’s episode, many commenters believed the third personality, Jake Lockley, made a appearance, but I wasn’t so sure. This time around, in that office, Isaac’s accent definitely shifted to broad New York (even if the episode’s subtitles had it as Marc speaking). Of course, if it wasn’t him, who else committed all those brutal killings during Marc and Steven’s blackouts? I was expecting more definite Lockley proof than this. (I didn’t have to wait too long for that, though.) And so we finished up, back in Steven’s London flat, he and Marc sharing a body and headspace much more harmoniously than at the beginning of the series. We then got a reprise of Engelbert Humperdinck’s Man Without Love and the first post-credits scene of the series, in which Jake Lockley took Harrow out of a psychiatric hospital, poured him into the back of a limo and shot him. “Why would I ever need anybody else, when he has no idea how troubled he truly is?” said the onlooking Khonshu of his “friend”. “Today is your turn to lose,” said Lockley, speaking Spanish, pulling the trigger. With Marc and Steven seemingly relieved from duty, and Jake doing Khonshu’s violent bidding, does that mean the big bird pulled a trick – only pretending to release them from service, knowing full well that he had a third personality to call upon? Them finding out they’ve been played, whenever that might be, is going to be fun. It was a satisfying, tantalising close to what is probably best described as a mixed series. On one hand, it was fresh, innovative and quite unlike anything we’ve seen before from Marvel (at least the MCU version of Marvel TV), plus Oscar Isaac, Ethan Hawke and May Calamawy were all wonderful throughout. On the other, the plot was meandering, Moon Knight barely featured and, after a solid start, it took a dip in episode three before sprinting to the finish with three excellent episodes. We never got the MCU crossover I wanted/expected, either. Does Moon Knight, now that he has been established, just show up elsewhere, or does he get another season before mixing with the likes of Blade and Ghost Rider? If that is the case, I would want that second season to deal with street-level crime more akin to Daredevil rather than tomb-hopping Indiana Jones-esque capers. The opening song was The End by Earl Grant. “At the end of the river / The water stops its flow / At the end of a highway / There’s no place you can go / But just tell me you love me / And you are only mine / And our love will go on ’til the end of time.” Did Marvel slip up on Twitter and accidentally reveal there is going to be another series of Moon Knight? At first, the account tweeted about the “season” finale, later changing it to “series” finale. Semantics? Or something more? Say what you like about Harrow, but I really liked his sunglasses. They look not unlike the Randolph Engineering aviators Don Draper used to wear. The facility Harrow was wheeled out of in the post-credit scene was called Sienkiewicz. Bill Sienkiewicz was a key artist on the Moon Knight comics from issue No 1. What did you think of the finale? Did it “stick the landing” as people insist on saying now, for some reason? Which MCU hero would you like to see team up with Moon Knight?

5/5/2022,"James Stunt, the former son-in-law of Bernie Ecclestone, took “a very hands-on approach” as his company became involved in a “sophisticated” £266m money-laundering operation, a court heard. Stunt is one of eight defendants on trial accused of laundering cash from criminal activity by using it to buy gold. Prosecutors claim the “criminal cash” was deposited in the bank account of Bradford gold dealer Fowler Oldfield over two years. It was then used to buy millions of pounds worth of gold bars which were melted down into “untraceable, unidentifiable” gold grain, the court heard. Leeds Cloth Hall court previously heard that hundreds of thousands of pounds at a time was brought in carrier bags and holdalls to Fowler Oldfield. One courier arrived with cash disguised in a takeaway food box, the prosecution said. Jurors were told the alleged money laundering then “went national” as one of Fowler Oldfield’s directors, Greg Frankel, became a vice-president of Stunt & Co, and Stunt’s premises in London also started receiving cash. Prosecutor Nicholas Clarke QC said the defendants hid the origin of the money by washing it through a company bank account and using the proceeds to buy gold. On Wednesday, jurors were shown messages between Stunt’s employees and co-defendants Alex Tulloch and Francesca Sota, and staff at Fowler Oldfield. The court heard one message from Tulloch in November 2015 said: “James not happy though … James wants to know what his profit is for this week. Concerned about profitability etc.” Prosecutor Nicholas Clarke QC said this showed Stunt was “taking a very hands-on approach even though he was a very long way away at the time”. “He was not involved in the day-to-day management of the buying and selling of gold and was not included in most of the correspondence via electronic means,” he said. “However, emails between others demonstrate that he was very much aware of and authorised what was going on.” Stunt has three children with Petra Ecclestone, daughter of F1 tycoon Bernie Ecclestone. The couple married in 2011, and were divorced in 2017. Five defendants from Fowler Oldfield – Greg Frankel, Daniel Rawson, Paul Miller, Heidi Buckler and Haroon “Harry” Rashid – all say the prosecution cannot prove that any of the cash was criminal property. Stunt and the defendants from his company – Tulloch and Sota – say they “don’t know whether it was”, the court has heard. But prosecutors say it is “blindingly obvious this was criminal cash” and that each of the defendants “must at the very least have suspected that the source of the money was criminal in origin”. Clarke told jurors the cash deposits into the Fowler Oldfield bank account aroused the suspicions of bank staff because “they were of such an amount, on a daily basis, as may come from a Premier League football stadium on a match day or similar size venue or event”. On some days “well over a million pounds in used notes” was being paid into the Fowler Oldfield account, he said. Buckler, 45, Frankel, 44, Miller, 45, Rashid, 51, Rawson, 45, Sota, 34, Stunt, 40 and Tulloch, 41, all deny money laundering. Stunt and Sota also deny forgery.

5/5/2022,"A father who killed his two-year-old son after discovering that his mother was in a new relationship has been jailed for life. Lukasz Czapla, 41, was unanimously found guilty of the murder of Julius Czapla and was ordered to spend a minimum of 23 years behind bars. The judge described the murder as “truly evil, causing a defenceless child considerable distress”. The court heard that the former IT technician shot his son in the head with a BB gun, stabbed him with a skewer-like instrument and smothered him with a pillow at an address in Muirhouse, Edinburgh, in November 2020. The high court in Edinburgh heard it was in an act of “revenge and jealousy” to “get back” at his former partner. Czapla had offered to plead guilty to culpable homicide, claiming diminished responsibility. However, prosecutors declined his plea and pursued a murder conviction. After the verdict, Patrycja Szczesniak, Julius’s mother, said she will fight to ensure Czapla “never leaves prison”. Szczesniak had separated from Czapla two months before he murdered their son. In a statement released through Police Scotland, she said: “Czapla should not have the right to any defence and we will fight to ensure that monster never leaves prison. “I only wanted the best for you [Julius]. If only I could turn back time to have you in my arms again, my child.” Szczesniak added that her little boy loved and trusted his father. She said: “Despite the break-up with Julius’s dad, I wanted him to have contact with our son. I never stopped him seeing Julius. Julius was murdered only for revenge. His dad wanted me to suffer, he succeeded and achieved his goal, at the cost of my beloved little boy’s life.” The court had heard that Czapla had been drinking alcohol and had taken prescribed antidepressants the night that he killed his son. Addressing Czapla, judge John Beckett said: “As a result of your actions, your son will never grow up.” Lord Beckett added: “There is no excuse you were filled with drink and drugs. “You acted out of spite to kill this child to get back at his mother.” The judge offered members of the jury counselling services, adding: “There can be nothing in your lives that will prepare you for this experience, I imagine it’s taken quite a toll for you to hear about such terrible violence inflicted on such a defenceless child for no reason, and bad reasons.” He referred to forensic consultant psychiatrist Dr Alexander Quinn’s comments during the trial in which he described the events as “one of the most difficult and most harrowing of cases”. Giving evidence during the trial, Czapla claimed that he killed his son because he had decided to end his own life and could not face leaving Julius behind without a father like he had been. He previously told the court: “I did not want him to suffer at all, that was not my intention. I had this stupid idea from the TV that people just die instantly.” Czapla had previously pleaded guilty to nine other charges on the indictment, including dangerous driving offences and possession of an airgun. Sentences for each of these will run concurrently with his life sentence, the court heard.
