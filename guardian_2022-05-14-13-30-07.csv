5/14/2022,"Anthony Albanese says the prime minister, Scott Morrison, broke “faith and trust” with the US by waiting four-and-a-half months to brief Labor on the Aukus deal. Albanese was responding to a report in Nine newspapers that the Biden administration would only consider the project if it had bipartisan support. Morrison delayed consulting the opposition until the day before the announcement of the pact in September last year. The Aukus pact, a three-way strategic defence alliance between Australia, the UK and US initially to build a class of nuclear-propelled submarines, led to the scrapping of a contract between Australia and France to replace Australia’s existing Collins fleet with diesel electric-powered submarines. Announcing a Labor pledge to boost Medicare in the Northern Territory on Saturday, Albanese described the report as serious and said it indicated the US government had repeatedly sought assurances that the deal would have bipartisan support. He said the Biden administration understood the Aukus deal would be an upgrade to Australia’s alliance with the US and the UK that would have implications beyond a single term of government. “The Biden administration reached out to Republicans and to people on the other side of their political system, to ensure that it would have that support within the United States,” Albanese said. “And the Biden administration sought reassurance from the Australian government that Australian Labor had been consulted on these issues. “It is extraordinary that the prime minister broke that faith and trust with our most important ally by not briefing Australian Labor on these issues.” Albanese said Morrison contacted him the day before the announcement and asked him to fly to Canberra. Labor’s deputy leader, Richard Marles, Penny Wong and Brendan O’Connor were also at the briefing. Morrison told the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age he had waited until the last minute to consult the opposition because he believed they would support the deal – which they did. Albanese told reporters on Saturday that decision would have caused tension with the US at a time when Australia’s relationship with France was also under strain and vowed not to “treat national security issues as an opportunity to make a difference on partisan domestic political points”. “The fact that the United States had made a request to Australia that was ignored for four and a half months shows that this is a prime minister who always plays short-term politics, is not interested in the national interest.” Earlier on Saturday, Morrison was in the Melbourne electorate of Deakin to announce $20.2m in funding to expand the sporting schools program. Morrison again pitched a change in approach, saying the country had faced tough times but was heading into “better days”. “We have had to come through and toughed it out and push through as hard as we possibly can, and as a prime minister and as a government we have had to do that as well,” he said. “But as we go into this time of opportunity, and that is exactly what it is, and the kids reminded me of that again this morning, as we go into that time of opportunity, as a government, we change gears, as a prime minister, I change gears, and we go and secure those opportunities ahead.”",News/World news,Albanese says Morrison broke faith with US by delaying Labor’s Aukus briefing,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/14/albanese-says-morrison-broke-faith-with-us-by-delaying-labors-aukus-briefing
