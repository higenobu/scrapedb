3/3/2022,"US authorities are investigating reports of illness among infants who consumed powdered baby formula produced at Michigan facility operated by Abbott Nutrition, following a widespread recall and the deaths of at least two children. On 17 February Abbott Nutrition voluntarily recalled three of its formula products: Similac, Alimentum and EleCare. The company further recalled another round of Similac PM 60/40 from the same Michigan facility on Monday following the death of an infant, the second since September. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the agencies conducting the investigation, have urged parents to avoid feeding their baby the recalled products. The second infant who died tested positive for ​​Cronobacter sakazakii, a bacteria that can cause sepsis or meningitis in infants. According to the CDC, the disease is often associated with the consumption of infant formula – which is not sterile – and can be found in both samples contaminated in factories as well as those that are opened after purchase. Abbott Nutrition said in a statement issued on 17 February that it has conducted routine testing for Cronobacter sakazakii and Salmonella newport in its facilities, and while they did find the former in “non-product contact areas” of the Michigan facility, none of their distributed product tested positive for either bacteria. The initial recall of the three Abbott brands alarmed many families, as some of the products are specifically designed for children who have deadly food allergies or those with lactose sensitivity, and strictly rely on the formula. One mother told CNN that the recall has made it “literally a life or death thing” for her nearly four-year-old daughter who has a bowel condition. Three days after the initial recall, two Florida parents filed a class-action lawsuit against the company for allegedly putting their infants in harm’s way by producing “toxic baby formula products.” A representative of Abbott Nutrition acknowledged receipt of the complaint and told NPR they’re reviewing it. The lawsuit further accuses the firm of using “misleading” practices to promote their products, claims that echoed those in a recent global report that found infant formula is often promoted in an “aggressive” and “misleading” ways across the world, according to the World Health Organization and Unicef. On Friday, before the second recall, senators Patty Murray and Bob Casey sent a letter addressed to Abbott CEO Robert B Ford, demanding to know about the recall and seek “all internal documents and communications” with regards to the issue, according to the 19th. “No parent should have to worry that the formula they feed to their infant or child may be contaminated,” Casey told the 19th. “Chair Murray and I are pressing Abbott for answers because parents, caregivers and babies deserve better.” They gave the company a deadline of 10 March to respond to their query. In an updated statement shared on Monday, Abbott Nutrition reiterated that none of the distributed products tested positive for the bacteria. “This case is under investigation, and at this time the cause of the infant’s Cronobacter sakazakii infection has not been determined,” the company added. “We want to extend our heartfelt sympathies to the family.”",News/US news,Reports of infant illnesses investigated following US formula recall,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/03/reports-infant-illnesses-under-investigation-following-us-formula-recall
3/3/2022,"There is a chance that, in years to come, we’ll look back at 2022 as Netflix’s Age of Grifters. Almost every show to hit it big so far this year has had a gruesome element of real-life deceit to it. There was The Tinder Swindler documentary, then Inventing Anna. And now Worst Roommate Ever. You may already have seen Worst Roommate Ever, because it is in Netflix’s top 10. And if you have watched it, there is a chance that this will be because the concept of bad roommates is universal. One old roommate of mine, for instance, locked himself out, smashed a window to get in then refused to pay for repairs. Another shaved his beard into the sink and didn’t clean up. Terrible behaviour. The worst. And so with some dismay – and a thudding inevitability – I learned that Worst Roommate Ever is just a true-crime documentary. That’s it. A cookie-cutter, assembly-line, true-crime documentary so blindingly impersonal that it feels as if it was conceived by robots. Broadly speaking, all four cases covered in the series (the last is a two-parter, but we’ll come to that in a moment) are about people who abused positions of trust. They moved in with people – or people moved in with them – and then, whether by obsession or design or lifelong compulsion, murdered them. One is a nice old lady, a Gus Fring-type who revelled in philanthropy outwardly despite being a serial killer. Another is a man who fell in love with his roommate with terrible consequences. Another appeared to model his behaviour on Michael Keaton’s character in Pacific Heights. You get the picture. My feelings are that, if you’re going to dedicate several man hours and hundreds of thousands of dollars to telling a story about a real person whose life was forcibly ended in one of the most unthinkable ways possible, try to show a bit of respect. The BBC’s recent The Hunt for Bible John was a perfect example, taking care to put the murders into social and economic context, highlighting the frustrations of the detectives, and most importantly showing the howling vacuum left by the murder. Worst Roommate Ever does not do this. It’s called Worst Roommate Ever, for crying out loud. You cannot conceivably make a true-crime documentary that respects the dead if its title could just as conceivably be used for a gameshow. And that goes double when barely any time has passed since the crime actually took place. One murder in this series happened five years ago. That’s barely enough to process any death at all, not least one marked by unimaginable violence. After five years you can still feel the tendrils of the life unlived. But whoops! Worst Roommate Ever! The stories aren’t well told, either. We see the person who definitely did it, meet the investigating officer who knows immediately that the person did it, then they’re arrested. There’s no cat and mouse to any of it, because the mouse is dead and the cat is in a boredom-induced coma. Most sadly of all, something salvageable does exist at the centre of Worst Roommate Ever. The final story, told across two episodes, does genuinely appear to be about the worst roommate who ever lived; a serial lodger who first moved in with, then blithely intimidated, a succession of ruined housemates. By some degree, his is the most attention-worthy story of the four. You can’t help but wonder if the producers would have been better off doing more work on this story and jettisoning the others. It still would have been miserable and condescending, and designed to only appeal to the lowest common denominator, but crucially it would have been shorter. If you haven’t already dipped your toes into Worst Roommate Ever, my advice would be not to bother. At the rate things are going, it’ll only be a minute or two before Netflix’s next glibly patronising true-crime documentary hits our screens.",Arts/Television & radio,Worst Roommate Ever: this might officially be the worst true crime show ever,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/03/worst-roommate-ever-this-might-officially-be-the-worst-true-show-ever
3/3/2022,"Joe Perkins, like most gardeners, has typically been more animated by what’s going on above the ground than below it. The quality of the soil was important, no question, but what was really going on down there felt mysterious and impenetrable. As for fungi, it usually meant one thing in a garden, and that wasn’t good news. “On a domestic level, our relationship and understanding of fungi in the past has very much been that it’s something about decay, it’s about disease, and it’s something that we don’t particularly want in our gardens,” says Perkins, a 45-year-old landscape architect based in Sussex, who won three awards at the RHS Chelsea Flower Show in 2019. “It’s fair to say that, as gardeners, we’ve not always fully understood – and I still don’t – the importance of these systems.” What changed for Perkins was reading research by the American mycologist and fungi guru Dr Paul Stamets and British biologist Merlin Sheldrake’s 2020 revelatory book, Entangled Life. This year, the tech giant, now called Meta, has commissioned him to make another Chelsea garden and Perkins has decided to build an immersive environment that celebrates the symbiotic exchange between soil, fungi and plants. “Our relationship with fungi is changing, and I think it will be an irreversible change,” he predicts. “You find yourself getting caught up in all the huge implications of it. It’s a totally separate kingdom to plants and animals, and it’s possibly the biggest kingdom about which we know very, very little. If you imagine how the Victorian plant hunters felt when they were discovering all these new plants back in the 18th and 19th century, it’s almost like that. It’s the new frontier, isn’t it?” At this point, a glossary might be handy. “Fungi” is the overarching name for a kingdom of spore-producing organisms that feed on organic matter. “Mushrooms” are the fruiting bodies of fungi, the place where spores are produced. Mushrooms are sometimes compared to icebergs, because most of the activity is actually taking place under the surface, out of sight. Here, networks of “mycelium”, the vegetative part of the fungus, twist through the soil and make connections between plants. It’s now understood that more than 90% of plants depend on mycorrhizal fungi for improving their water and nutrient absorption, which has led to these networks being called the “Wood Wide Web”. Jumping off from the theme of interconnectedness, Perkins’s upcoming Chelsea design will include a large timber pavilion, based on hexagonal structures that represent mycelium pathways, and feature two habitats: woodland edge and a stylised meadow. If you choose to look for them, Perkins makes plenty of nods to sustainability and the threats posed by climate change, but there will also be a vibrant colour scheme. “It has to be a beautiful garden as well, because it’s Chelsea,” he says. Perkins’s new fascination with fungi and their mycorrhizal relationships with plants is not just theoretical; it has made an impact on how he gardens on a practical level, too. “The old advice was to get air into the soil and get rid of all the weeds and everything. And actually, the process of digging up through that surface layer just pulls apart all the mycelial connections. So, from my observations, I would say don’t do that. Leave the soil alone.” Perkins has other radical, even hair-raising tips for gardeners. “Don’t be too tidy,” he says. “Some fungi are decomposers and they will take the dead plant material back into the soil and recycle it, and make it available to the other plants for nutrients. If you really don’t want to do that, at least leave some towards the back of the borders, so there are some opportunities for that to happen.” Fungi, of course, is not only the horticulturist’s friend. These organisms are now finding innovative applications in fashion, health, technology and art. Also in construction: Biohm was founded in 2016 in Bermondsey, south London, by Ehab Sayed, a 31-year-old originally from Egypt. The company looks to the natural world for inspiration and its team of 20 is currently experimenting with more than 300 different strains of mycelium in an effort to “train” them to consume waste from food and building processes, even plastic, that would otherwise end up in landfill. Biohm has also developed mycelium insulation, which is competitive with traditional petrochemical and plastic-based construction materials in its thermal and acoustic properties, but safer and non-toxic. Last year, Biohm received backing from Waitrose, which created a £1m grant from the sale of carrier bags, to fund its work on breaking down plastics using mycelium. Sayed suggests that the results – which will be “transformational” – are just two years away from being available at scale. “The sky’s the limit,” he says. “We’re exploring projects in outer space at the moment, seeing how we can grow mycelium in a vacuum, and looking at how we can break down toxins that have been completely irremediable.” What really excites both Sayed and Perkins, though, is how little we know about fungi and its byproducts. It is believed that we have only documented 6% of all fungal species: there could be anywhere between 2.2m and 3.8m species in the world, which is up to 10 times greater than the estimated number of plant species. “What I love about mycelium is it’s the source of life, really,” says Sayed. “It’s what enables the cycles of nature to take place. There’s so much we have to learn from it and we’ve barely scratched the surface.”The RHS Chelsea Flower Show runs from 24-28 May",Lifestyle/Life and style,The magic of mushrooms: how they connect the plant world,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/03/the-magic-of-mushrooms-how-they-connect-the-plant-world
3/3/2022,"The NHS is facing a deepening staffing crisis, with the number of unfilled posts across health services in England rising to 110,192, official figures show. The shortages include 39,652 nurses and 8,158 doctors, according to the latest quarterly data for health service vacancies published by NHS Digital. The disclosure prompted warnings that the shortage of frontline personnel would lead to longer delays, hit the campaign to cut the 6.1m treatment backlog and undermine quality of care. Staff groups said they feared that low pay, burnout from heavy workloads and constant pressure during shifts, compounded by the Covid-19 pandemic, were leading demoralised workers to quit. Across England, one in 10 (10.3%) nursing posts are lying empty, and one in 17 (5.8%) doctors’ posts. The 110,192 vacancies across NHS England in October to December 2021 represents 8.3% of the total workforce – one in 12 of all posts. Those 110,192 vacancies are more than 6,000 up on the 103,754 unfilled posts in NHS England in the previous three months. That is the highest quarterly total since the 111,864 in April-June 2019, and is the third worst since records began in 2018. The 39,652 nursing vacancies represent 10.3% of the nursing workforce. Although that is 161 fewer than in the previous three months, it is 3,375 more than in the same quarter last year. At least 9% of all nursing posts have been vacant since 2018. “The fact that nursing vacancies remain stubbornly high, at about 40,000 in the NHS in England, is deeply worrying. With every job that remains unfilled, safe patient care becomes even harder to maintain”, said Patricia Marquis, the Royal College of Nursing’s director for England. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, said: “The Conservatives’ scrapping of the nursing bursary and failure to fix staffing shortages has been disastrous for the NHS, and patients are paying the price. NHS staff do heroic work but there simply aren’t enough of them. Yet the government still has no plan to fill these positions, meaning patients will continue to wait unacceptable lengths of time for treatment.” The new statistics emerged as the government came under intense pressure to publish a long-term NHS workforce plan to end the endemic understaffing, and to provide regular updates on staff shortages in each area of care. Ministers must also disclose how plans to recruit the right number of workers are progressing. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of the hospitals body NHS Providers, said this week that ministers were being “incredibly shortsighted” in refusing to accept that the NHS needed a long-term workforce plan to help it function better. He blamed the Treasury for the government’s opposition. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, has promised to publish a 15-year workforce plan, drawn up by Health Education England, by the end of the month, though it is unclear how detailed it will be. NHS Digital’s figures show nurse vacancy rates are highest in London (13%), the south-east (11.3%) and the Midlands (11%) and lowest in the south-west (7.9%). London also has the biggest shortfall (11.9%) of nurses in acute – hospital-based – care. One in six (17.1%) of all posts in mental health nursing are vacant, with particular shortages in the south-east (21.7%), east of England (20.3%) and London (18.2%). Doctor shortages are worst in the Midlands, where one in 11 posts are unfilled. The Midlands is short of 1,678 medics to work in acute care, an 8% vacancy rate. Dr Fiona Donald, the president of the Royal College of Anaesthetists, said: “The shortfall means the NHS will struggle to tackle the backlog and places extra pressure on colleagues to complete extra shifts”. She said about 1m fewer cancer, heart and other lifesaving operations a year were carried out as a direct result of the NHS’s shortage of 1,400 anaesthetists.

3/3/2022,"Players in Russia who want to move to another country because of the invasion of Ukraine should be granted an emergency reopening of the transfer window, according a new idea being proposed to Fifa. The Polish Football Association, which has led opposition to continued Russian involvement in international competition since the outbreak of war, has written to Fifa making the suggestion, with hundreds of foreign players playing their club football in Russia. The Ukrainian defender Yaroslav Rakitskyi has left Zenit Saint Petersburg and more players are expected to follow at other clubs, with Poland’s Grzegorz Krychowiak hoping to be allowed to leave Krasnodar. This week too the manager of Lokomotiv Moscow, Markus Gisdol, left his role, as did Daniel Farke, the former Norwich City manager who had recently joined Krasnodar. Both managers expressed concerns over working in Russia during the invasion. The imposition of global sanctions has seen a collapse in the value of the rouble, meaning that some clubs are struggling to pay players’ wages, with contracts commonly agreed in euros. Some high-profile players may see their contracts cancelled, but a plan to reopen the window would see all contracted players given the opportunity to negotiate deals elsewhere. Fifa were approached by the Guardian for comment. European football bodies have this week been concentrating on trying to help players in the Ukrainian league reach safety, one small part of the growing migrant crisis caused by the war. On Thursday the president of Uefa, Aleksander Ceferin, said the war was the “most terrible situation” and that the “madness” of the conflict must stop. “I was on the phone for 48 hours with clubs and coaches to get them out of the Ukraine,” Ceferin told the Financial Times Business of Football Summit. “It’s hard for me to explain how sad those conversations were. One of the players who left Ukraine came to my home, another came today. They told me about their children and about the bombs exploding outside their home. I am proud of the football family that we stood together to do our part. The football part. It’s really hard to say what will happen tomorrow but this war should stop, this madness should stop.” Ceferin said it was “impossible” to say under what circumstances the ban on Russian football might be reversed. “For now it stays and we are waiting for peace to come,” he said. “Football will probably be the least important thing.” Uefa has moved the Champions League final from Russia and cancelled its longstanding sponsorship deal with Gazprom. It has previously sought to steer clear of making decisions that could be seen as political, including during the men’s European Championship last summer when it refused a request to illuminate Munich’s Allianz Arena in the colours of the rainbow flag. Also speaking at the Football Summit, the general secretary of the players’ union Fifpro, Jonas Baer-Hoffmann, said the current crisis meant that football could no longer claim to sit outside of politics. “I think sport has to accept that the idea you make an institution apolitical is just a myth,” Hoffman said. “Because what people do with it makes it political. If Putin decides it’s not apolitical it’s not. Football should stand for values of peace freedom sovereignty, human rights but also equality. The rainbow flag is a political decision.”",Sport/Football,Fifa urged to reopen transfer window and give players in Russia escape route,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/03/fifa-urged-to-reopen-transfer-window-russia-polish-fa
3/3/2022,"A week into the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Black Sea port of Kherson has become the first major Ukrainian target to fall under the de facto control of Moscow’s forces. Russian artillery and missiles continue to bombard other major cities, including the second-biggest city, Kharkiv, and the capital, Kyiv, where several large explosions were heard overnight. But the Russian advance on the capital has been delayed by “staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion” and is still more than 19 miles (30km) from the centre of the city, Britain’s defence ministry said. Mariupol city council has said Russia is constantly and deliberately shelling critical civilian infrastructure in the southern Ukrainian port, leaving it without water, heating or power, and preventing supplies being brought in or people being evacuated. Residents in the key Black Sea port of Odesa are increasing preparations to defend it against a potential Russian amphibious landing, amid sightings of a convoy of Russian warships. A second round of talks between Ukraine and Russia was due to get under way on Thursday. The international criminal court (ICC) has opened an investigation into possible war crimes in Ukraine after 39 countries formally referred reports of atrocities, the largest referral it has ever received. And more than 1 million people have so far fled Ukraine in the fastest refugee exodus this century, the UN said. Russian troops in the southern city of Kherson after forcing their way into the council building:  A series of explosions were reported in Kyiv in the early hours of Thursday following Russian airstrikes. The CBS reporter Charlie D’Agata was filmed as a bright flash and large boom could be seen and heard behind him.  The basement of a Kyiv hospital is now the maternity ward, where new mothers are bringing new life into a world violently upended by the invasion. On Thursday 24 February, Russia attacked Ukraine along multiple axes, bringing to a calamitous end weeks of fruitless diplomatic efforts by western leaders to avert war. Fighting and other military activity took place around and on the way to Kyiv. A substantial attack was aimed at the eastern city of Kharkiv. Russian forces also headed north and east from Crimea. On Friday 25 February, Russian forces reached the outskirts of Kyiv and carried out an amphibious assault from the Sea of Azov near Mariupol. The shape of the Russian incursion became clearer. On Saturday 26 February, Russian forces in control of territory to the north-west of Kyiv continued their assault on the capital. Elsewhere, heavy fighting was reported in and around Kharkiv and there were Ukrainian counterattacks in some places previously claimed by Russian forces. On Monday 28 February, Russian rocket attacks killed dozens of people in Kharkiv. Pre-dawn blasts were heard again in Kyiv and in Mariupol, which was surrounded by Russian forces and under heavy attack. On Tuesday 1 March, Russian forces bombarded the government headquarters in Kharkiv, and the armoured column continued rolling towards the capital. On Wednesday 2 March, Moscow’s forces took the port and train station in the strategically important city of Kherson, on the Black Sea. Russian paratroopers landed in Kharkiv (pictured below) overnight, after several days of fierce bombardment that killed or wounded dozens of civilians. Kyiv came under more heavy shelling as Russian forces stepped up their offensive and moved closer towards the capital in an apparent attempt to encircle it. Mariupol was reportedly surrounded by Russian troops.  Over the past few months Russia deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Vladimir Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Moscow’s army, consisting of around 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment has since grown. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also show increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. Since then low-level fighting has continued along the front, and each side has accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands is a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Europe’s most divisive energy project, the route of Nord Stream 2 bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/03/russias-war-in-ukraine-complete-guide-in-maps-video-and-pictures
3/3/2022,"Londoners have struggled for a third day to move around the capital as a strike by tube workers brought much of the transport system to a standstill. Most London Underground services were completely halted on Thursday as about 10,000 staff in the RMT union went on a second 24-hour strike this week, following a walkout on Tuesday, in a row over jobs and pensions – a stoppage that also led to widespread disruption for Wednesday morning rush hour. Queues and congestion appeared slightly less severe on Thursday, with finer weather encouraging more to heed Transport for London (TfL) advice to walk or cycle for essential journeys or to work from home where possible. The number of bus journeys recorded in the morning rush hour fell by 200,000 from Tuesday’s 1.51m, when many commuters had pursued alternative journeys, pushing bus patronage up to 85% of normal pre-pandemic levels – the highest weekday since March 2020. Many people struggled to board overloaded buses in areas where tube stations were closed on Tuesday, possibly deterring them from attempting similar travel on the second strike day. TfL had warned people to expect all tube services across the capital to be suspended on Thursday, but was managing to run limited trains on some outer, overground stretches of the District, Central, and Northern lines. London Overground services were running normally, unlike on the first strike day when some stations with tube interchanges were affected. At Oxford Circus, in the centre of London, staff on the picket line said the action was in passengers’ interests – although those struggling to get around disagreed. Daniel Randall, 35, an RMT member on the tube station’s picket line, told PA Media: “We’re standing up for a properly funded, properly staffed tube system, and we feel that’s very much in passengers’ interests as well as our interests.” But Sharon Lennox, 31, a security officer waiting for a bus nearby, said: “It is OK for some. I am not one of those who are lucky enough to work from home. I have been tapping on the bus doors and the drivers pretend they can’t see.” The strike comes after the RMT union said its members were faced with paying the price for a financial crisis after the Covid pandemic, after TfL agreed to reduce posts and look at pensions as a condition of the emergency funding given by central government. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, has agreed to review TfL’s pension scheme and cut staffing levels by about 10% by not replacing staff who leave or retire. The RMT general secretary, Mick Lynch, said: “Our members across London Underground are making it crystal clear again this morning that they are not going to be used as pawns in a political fight between the mayor and the government which threatens their futures and their livelihoods. The funding crisis at TfL which is at the heart of this dispute is not of our making, and our members are not prepared to take a hammering to pay for it.” Andy Lord, TfL’s chief operating officer, apologised to customers over the “completely unnecessary” strike, adding that TfL had not proposed any changes to pensions or terms and conditions, and nobody would lose their job. During early morning rush hour on Friday, there is expected to be similar disruption to that on Wednesday, with tube services only starting from 8am, according to TfL.",News/UK news,London commuters grapple with third day of tube strike disruption,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/03/london-commuters-third-day-tube-strike-disruption
3/3/2022,"This week the tube workers went on strike, and the Telegraph called them “the enemy underground” and complained that “Putin apologists” had “brought London to a standstill”. It was the silliness, more than the vulgar opportunism, that caught the eye. The tube was actually down because of a row over pensions and staffing levels. Two weeks ago, university lecturers were striking on the same principle, though more recently their actions have also been centred on the whole spectrum of declining pay and conditions – a pension raid is often just the most visible edge of a wider erosion of rights. Building a casuistic case linking union action to a brutal kleptocrat’s war, via a Morning Star subscription, is essentially an attempt to delegitimise unions altogether – and not even a serious attempt: more of a festive sidebar to the more sober main narrative. The more conventional attacks on strikes in any sector follow the same broad contours: why should they get pensions and pay risesand job security when most people don’t? Why should a tube driver be paid £55,000 a year, or a GP £70,000, when most people earn less than that? Shouldn’t they pipe down if they’re so keen on equality? The casualisation of the general workforce has intensified this dichotomy between unionised workers, with a proper employment contract that can form the basis of a dispute, and everyone else. Even before Covid, workers had been stratified into the self-employed, with no rights, the so-called limb (b) workers, with variable hours and very few rights, and the ones with full rights. Post-pandemic, fire-and-rehire tactics have driven down rights and conditions even in jobs where those were a given, with the TUC reporting that nearly one in 10 workers had been told to reapply for their jobs or face the sack, and one in four saying their working terms had been downgraded since the start of lockdown. It’s a particularly harsh environment for the young. The Resolution Foundation found that a full third of 18- to 34-year-olds, if they lost jobs during the pandemic, returned to “atypical” work, essentially meaning zero- or variable-hours contracts. Thus the anti-industrial action argument is distilled to its purest form: why should they be allowed to strike at all, when you can’t, and if you did, you would be instantly replaced, provided you were on the rota that day and anyone noticed you were striking? It is astonishing how much speculative discussion has been given to the possibility that Covid (plus Brexit effects) might put an inflationary pressure on wages – to the extent that Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, would enjoin good citizens not to ask for more money in these turbulent times – when the evidence was already there that pay and conditions for a significant block of employees had in fact been driven down. Nonetheless, these arguments have traction: not only because solidarity is complicated in an era of insecurity and fragmentation, but also because industrial action was devised for industries. The original equation between capital and labour was very clear: the withdrawal of the second directly affected the accretion of the first. A modern strike, in a service economy, principally affects customers. Strikes have more collateral damage; they hits commuters, students, people working in hospitality, it creates millions of dissipated inconveniences and hardships rather than one big hit, not least for the strikers themselves. (Though this has always been true, I was amazed to have to explain to my teenagers, who are daft but not stupid, that striking workers don’t get paid, and the tube drivers were inflicting the most pain upon themselves, in defence of a principle and their present and future colleagues.) In an age where jobs with rights and the potential for strike action are concentrating in the public sector, the effects are mainly felt by citizens, rather than employers, to the extent that the collateral becomes the whole of the damage. None of this is an argument against strikes. Particularly in view of the shameless anti-protest measures in the police and crime bill, it has never been more important to find new ways to exert collective power, and create strategies and allegiances. Sectors should be collaborating so that non-essential workers can strike on behalf of essential workers. Employees within organisations and movements could experiment with relay-strikes, so that the best paid jump first, and are hopefully disruptive enough that the worst paid never have to. The wildcat strikes of recent history carry vital lessons on what you can withdraw besides labour. In the early 80s, the strike of chemists’ shop assistants in Bradford and elsewhere in West Yorkshire involved the staff protesting by giving out free prescriptions. The strike of the bureaucrats in unemployment benefits offices, also in the 80s, targeted the system not the claimants. School strikes have shown that you don’t need economic heft to make an impact. The combined climate and living wage strikes of 2019 dispensed with the idea of fighting one thing at a time. What would have been the best way to show solidarity with the tube drivers this week? Not merely saying, “I don’t think they are, in fact, Putin apologists”; nor broadly defending their right to fight for the conditions they signed up to. But maybe to start exploring what industrial action looks like in a post-industrial age. It doesn’t have to look the same, only smaller.
