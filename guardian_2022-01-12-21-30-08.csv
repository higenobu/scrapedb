1/12/2022,"The story of Japanese jazz is about music and a movement, but also a nation’s state of mind – a daring vision of a better future after the second world war, sounded out on piano, drums and brass. Jazz is a distinctly American art form – the US’s greatest cultural achievement, in fact, along with hip-hop – and a healthy scene had formed in the 1920s and 30s as American players toured the clubs of Tokyo, Kobe and Osaka. But Japan had historically been an insular nation – its policy of sakoku, which for more than two centuries severely limited contact with the outside world, had only ended in the 1850s – and an increasingly nationalist government, feeling jazz diluted Japanese culture, began to crack down. By the second world war, “the music of the enemy” was outlawed. After the country’s surrender, occupying forces oversaw sweeping reforms. American troops brought jazz records with them; Japanese musicians picked up work entertaining the troops. There was a proliferation of jazz kissa (cafes), a distinctly Japanese phenomenon where locals could sit and listen to records for as long as they wanted. For some, jazz was the sound of modernity.  In those early postwar years, Japanese musicians were essentially copying the Americans they admired. “That’s what you do,” says Mike Higgins, co-curator of the J Jazz reissues series. “You start off imitating and then you assimilate and then you innovate.” Higgins and his fellow curator Mike Peden, both Britons, are longtime collectors who have spent vast quantities of time tracking down records, investigating labels and poring over obi strips (a band of paper wrapped around Japanese LPs). For the past few years, the pair have worked on Japanese jazz reissues for BBE Records, typically drawing from the late-1960s to the mid-80s, a period of fantastic innovation when a generation of musicians found their own voice. These releases have been part of a broader wave of Japanese jazz of the era reissued for western ears on labels such as Light in the Attic, Impex and We Release Jazz. “It’s humbling that there’s a lot of people obsessed with this sort of music worldwide,” says saxophonist Koichi Matsukaze. Matsukaze’s 1976 album At the Room 427 is set to be reissued as part of the J Jazz Masterclass series this month, and follows the 2018 reissue of his classic Earth Mother, from 1978. “I am at an elder age and I’m still active in my music,” he adds. “All of this is my origins.” To discuss the birth of modern Japanese jazz, Toshiko Akiyoshi provides an important base. The pianist was discovered playing in a club in 1952 by touring star Oscar Peterson and would go on to have a glittering career at home and stateside. Akiyoshi was the first Japanese artist to break away from simply copying American artists and develop a distinctive sound and identity that incorporated Japanese harmonies and instruments. At age 92, she’s still active today. By the late 1960s, the example of Akiyoshi, eclectic saxophonist Sadao Watanabe, and others spurred young artists to evolve away from Blue Note mimicry towards free jazz, fusion funk, spiritual, modal and bebop. These daring virtuosos implanted rock and electronic elements, or took influences from Afrobeat and flamenco music. The shift from mannered play to freewheeling individualism was reflected in a move away from sharp suits to a more unkempt look, and collaboration became important: take pianist Masabumi Kikuchi, who wrote and recorded with other artists to the point of being an almost guru-like figure in the scene. The technical proficiency of Japanese recording studios ensured many of the LPs are among the best sounding jazz records ever recorded, and while it would be wrong to apply an “independent good, majors bad” binary (large record companies produced plenty of far-out music too), the 1970s also saw the rise of smaller, private labels in Japan, such as Three Blind Mice, which offered extra opportunities for individualistic artists to record. “You started to sense a drift away from the short-form hard-bop numbers into more open ended, free-form music – quite psychedelic actually,” explains Higgins. “They ditched the suits and just dressed how they wanted to dress. They are influenced by what Miles [Davis] is doing in his electric music, but they are writing more of their own material, improvising more.” When asked if it was his intention to push the boundaries of Japanese jazz on his classic albums First and Mine – two projects released in 1970 that projected this new, uninhibited approach to the genre – saxophonist Kohsuke Mine says: “I did not think like that at all. I think we just recorded what came out naturally at the time.” Matsukaze, though, saw his music as actively rebelling against his musical forefathers. “In Japan, there’s this elder and subordinate culture,” he explains. “In the music scene, there’s your superiors saying, ‘Oh you have to play Charlie Parker.’ I was, at the time, very young and still growing [musically]; there were student demonstrations and society in Japan was very volatile. That kind of spirit was in Japanese jazz as well. I was very anti-establishment. Some people would say, ‘You should play standards,’ but I hated doing that. I would rebel against that. At the time, I considered myself an outsider.” Matsukaze’s music encapsulates the power and passion of the era. The title track from Earth Mother – full of melodic hooks, elastic baselines and zigzagging solos – kicked off the very first J Jazz compilation, and At the Room 427 goes further back in time. Matsukaze’s debut album was recorded live in November 1975 in front of a small audience in a classroom at Chuo University. On Little Drummer, Matsukaze and his small band intensely wrangle their instruments in a way that almost sounds like they’re dueling one another. It forms a thrilling, improvisational composition, like a blindfolded motorist on the highway putting their foot to the floor yet never crashing. He might have rejected expectations to play the classics, but Matsukaze distinguishes himself on the Billie Holiday classic Lover Man, as his slinking, sensual saxophone wails lead the band like a flaming torch. The mid-1980s marks the end of the period covered in the J Jazz series. “For me, it becomes less interesting [after that], they’re playing MOR sort of stuff,” says Higgins. “The whole digital technology thing comes in. The sound of drums changes, keyboards change. There’s a general sonic tone, that sheen, across the music that appeals to me less.” In the years since, Europe and the US have indulged in a decades-long fascination with Japanese culture that doesn’t appear to be subsiding. The popularity of anime is at an all-time high, while there’s been a new interest in the Japanese city pop genre of the late 1970s and 80s. Now, it’s Japanese jazz that’s ripe for excavation. “Many of these albums were hardly accessible outside Japan back then,” explains Stephan Armleder of We Release Jazz, but the arrival of the internet “gave us this insane access to a gigantic archival database for music: blogs, message boards, YouTube, Discogs”. Putting together a reissue is not a straightforward business, with rights holders that need tracking down and dust blown off decades-old contracts: it took two years for Peden and Higgins to secure the licensing to every song on the first volume of J Jazz. But it’s worth it for the acts of preservation, like the Tohru Aizawa Quartet’s album Tachibana, reissued in 2018. Higgins believes only about 200 copies were ever pressed and many of those were used by the man who funded the project – the Tachibana of the title – as a kind of business card to promote his hotels. It’s easy to envision such a record becoming lost in time. Another classic that found a new life online is Ryo Fukui’s album Scenery: one posting of the 1976 LP, uploaded in 2015, has almost 12 million YouTube plays. The pianist’s playing is smooth and nuanced as he navigates American classics like It Could Happen to You. “Now I just need to become the kind of person that hosts sophisticated dinner parties,” wrote one commenter on YouTube. “I’m astounded that all these young jazz fans across the world found out and really liked Ryo Fukui’s music,” says his widow, Yasuko Fukui, speaking to me from her jazz club Slowboat, which she ran with Ryo until his death in 2016. “I’m sincerely happy that this is happening.” Living in the northern city of Sapporo, Fukui was focused on sharpening his craft when a director from Trio Records happened to catch a live performance by the Ryo Fukui Trio while on a business trip. “Initially Ryo didn’t think his skills were good enough to be recorded, so he didn’t say yes quickly,” says Yasuko. “But the director was persistent.” Fukui followed it up one year later with the album Mellow Dream, but spent the rest of his life recording only sporadically. He focused on running the Slowboat club in Sapporo, where he’d perform as many as four times a week. Eventually, fans who knew his work from YouTube began showing up at the club. Fukui died in 2016. Two years later, Scenery was repressed on vinyl by We Released Jazz. “Ryo Fukui embodies, for us, the magic of Japanese jazz,” says Armleder. “He combines a true respect for tradition and the history of jazz with a dedication to perfecting his skills, and adds his own flair and passion.” The popularity of rediscoveries like this means the price of original Japanese jazz pressings has gone through the roof. Higgins, one of the chief figures driving that interest, says that nowadays he couldn’t afford to build his personal collection, though I point out the flipside is that the value of his collection has skyrocketed. “That’s one of the reasons we want to reissue them,” he says of rising costs. “It’s nice to have an original copy, but I’ve never subscribed to the idea of sitting in a jazz bunker clutching my originals. I want people to hear them.” These reissues might be pressed on brand new vinyl, but between the grooves, you still feel change happening. It’s the sound of catharsis for these musicians, for whom no boundary was above testing. With thanks to Kensuke Hidaka for acting as translator.",Arts/Music,‘Society was volatile.

1/12/2022,"Boris Johnson has admitted attending an event in the Downing Street garden during the first lockdown and apologised to the nation while arguing the gathering could “technically” be said to have not broken any rules. Johnson’s version of events was not accepted by Keir Starmer, with the Labour leader saying the prime minister should step down. “The only question is: will the British public kick him out, will his party kick him out, or will he do the decent thing and resign?” Starmer said.  In a much-anticipated and carefully worded statement just before prime minister’s questions, Johnson acknowledged the mass public anger after an email emerged inviting No 10 staff to the event on 20 May 2020, which was billed as social. “Mr Speaker, I want to apologise,” he told a packed Commons. “I know that millions of people across this country have made extraordinary sacrifices over the last 18 months. I know the anguish that they have been through.” He said: “I know the rage they feel with me, and with the government I lead, when they think that in Downing Street itself the rules were not being properly followed by the people who make the rules.” Johnson said that on the evening concerned he joined the event for about 25 minutes from around 6pm, saying that, with the No 10 garden being used as “an extension of the office” amid lockdown, he believed it was a work event. “With hindsight I should have sent everyone back inside,” Johnson added, while arguing that the event “could be said, technically, to fall within the guidance” of the time. Johnson said he accepted many would disagree, adding: “To them, and to this house, I offer my heartfelt apology.” Johnson said it was important that Sue Gray, the senior civil servant investigating the gathering and series of other allegedly lockdown-breaching events in No 10 and elsewhere in government, be allowed to complete her report.

1/12/2022,"Chana masala, chole masala, channay, chholay: whatever you call it, this has fair claim to be the most popular curry in India, where it’s sold on the streets, served at parties and eaten at all times of day from breakfast to late-night snack. Cheap, nutritious and easy to make in quantity, it reheats well and, most importantly, tastes great. Prep 15 minCook 40 min (if using tinned chickpeas)Serves 4-6  450g drained cooked chickpeas (or just under 2 x 400g tins), or 200g dried chickpeas½ tsp bicarbonate of soda, if using dried chickpeas1 tbsp vegetable oil1 large onion1 tsp cumin seeds6 garlic cloves25g root ginger2-4 green chillies, to taste30g fresh coriander1 tbsp ground coriander1-2 tsp chilli powder1 tsp ground turmeric1 x 400g tin plum tomatoes1½ tsp fine salt1 tsp garam masala (see step 9)1 tbsp lemon juice Soak the dried chickpeas, if using, in cold water overnight, preferably with a half-teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda added, then drain, put in a pan, cover generously with cold water and bring to a simmer. Skim off any scum, turn down the heat and cook until tender – how long this takes will depend on the age of the chickpeas. Make sure there’s always at least 500ml liquid in the pan. Once the chickpeas are tender, pour 500ml cooking liquor into a jug, then drain off the rest. If, however, you’re using tinned chickpeas, put them in a pan with 500ml water (you can make some of that amount up with the liquid from the tin), bring to a simmer and cook for five minutes. Peel and finely chop the onion. Put the oil in a large, heavy-based pan over a medium heat and, once it’s hot, add the cumin seeds and fry, stirring so they don’t burn, until aromatic. Add the onion and turn the heat down, then cook, stirring regularly, until soft and golden. While the onion is cooking, peel and roughly chop the garlic and ginger, then put them in a mortar or mini chopper with the chillies (stalks removed but seeds and pith left in, unless you really don’t like heat) and about 25g of the fresh coriander. Grind or blitz to a fairly smooth paste, adding a splash of water if necessary. Scrape the paste into the onion pan and fry, stirring, for a couple of minutes, then add the ground coriander, chilli powder and turmeric (and a splash more oil if the mix looks in danger of catching), and cook, still stirring, for a couple of minutes more. Roughly chop the tomatoes if using whole ones (if you have access to ripe fresh tomatoes, you can use them instead). Add the tomatoes to the pan, stir in the chickpeas and their cooking water and the salt, then turn up the heat to bring the gravy to a lively simmer. Turn down the heat to medium low, and leave to bubble away for about 20 minutes, until slightly thickened. Stir in the garam masala (see step 9 if you want to make your own) and lemon juice, and check the seasoning. Turn off the heat and leave the chana masala to cool slightly, then roughly chop the remaining coriander leaves, scatter on top and serve. Chana masala is often served with flatbreads such as chapati, or pav buns, poori or rice, and with raita and/or a kachumber salad of chopped onions, cucumber and tomatoes, but it also makes a good vegetarian side dish. Replace 50g of the dried chickpeas with chana dal for a slightly thicker consistency. If you prefer things milder, stir in a couple of spoonfuls of plain full-fat yoghurt. And bulk out the dish, if need be, by adding two medium potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks, to the pan in step 6 (in which case you may need to cook the curry for longer, and add a little more water). To make your own deliciously aromatic garam masala, as per Madhur Jaffrey’s recipe, very slightly adapted for practicality, put the seeds from eight cardamom pods in a spice grinder or mortar with a teaspoon of black peppercorns, cloves and cumin seeds (preferably black, but brown will do), a stick of cinnamon and a third of a nutmeg, finely grated, then grind to a powder.

1/12/2022,"The US competition watchdog can proceed with a breakup lawsuit against Facebook’s owner, a federal judge has ruled. Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, the parent of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, had asked a court to dismiss an antitrust complaint brought by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for the second time. However, Judge James Boasberg said on Tuesday that the FTC’s revised lawsuit should be allowed to proceed.  “Ultimately, whether the FTC will be able to prove its case and prevail at summary judgment and trial is anyone’s guess. The court declines to engage in such speculation and simply concludes that at this motion-to-dismiss stage, where the FTC’s allegations are treated as true, the agency has stated a plausible claim for relief,” wrote Boasberg, of the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The FTC, under the new chair, Lina Khan, wants to force Meta to sell its photo-sharing app Instagram and its messaging service WhatsApp in one of the biggest challenges the government has brought against a tech company in decades. Its lawsuit accuses Meta of pursuing a “course of anti-competitive conduct”. The FTC originally sued Facebook during the Trump administration, and its complaint was rejected by the court in June last year. The agency filed an amended complaint in August, adding more detail on the accusation that the social media company had crushed or bought rivals. Meta’s platforms are used by 2.8 billion people around the world on a daily basis. Boasberg said this time round the FTC had been “far more robust and detailed” in presenting its case. He wrote: “The agency has also explained that Facebook not only possesses monopoly power but that it has wilfully maintained that power through anti-competitive conduct – specifically, the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.” In his ruling denying dismissal, the judge, however, said that the FTC could not press allegations that Facebook blocked competing apps from accessing its platform as a way to maintain its dominance, saying the policies had been abandoned in 2018. Meta said that it was confident the company would win in court. “Today’s decision narrows the scope of the FTC’s case by rejecting claims about our platform policies. It also acknowledges that the agency faces a ‘tall task’ proving its case regarding two acquisitions it cleared years ago,” a spokesperson said. Meta shares closed up 1.9% on Tuesday, closing at $334.37 and valuing the company at $930bn (£683bn).",News/Technology,"Lawsuit aiming to break up Facebook group Meta can go ahead, US court rules",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/12/lawsuit-aiming-to-break-up-facebook-group-meta-can-go-ahead-us-court-rules
1/12/2022,"If you want to understand how a group of teenagers with no journalistic experience created one of the most influential political social media accounts in the UK, then ask Travis Wright. The 18-year-old spent most of last year helping to build Politics For All which, before it was banned by Twitter last week, gained 100,000s of followers including cabinet ministers, celebrities, and sports stars.  By day he was studying multimedia journalism at a sixth form college in rural Suffolk but when lessons finished he was writing breaking news tweets that were being shared by cabinet ministers and Match of the Day host Gary Lineker. The trick Politics For All used to go viral was simple, he said: “You’d follow a tonne of journalists. And you’d see a tweet here or there and you’d say: ‘That’s good, I’ll take that’.” If you aren’t an obsessive follower of UK political news or – like most of the world – don’t spend much time on Twitter, then you might be wondering why we’re writing about the closure of a single news aggregation account. But there’s two essential issues in the parable of Politics For All: How real political influence can be rapidly gained on Twitter – and how this influence can be very rapidly lost, all at the whim of the social network and with little transparency. Climbing the social ladder Essentially, if Twitter is the place where the UK political news agenda is shaped, then Politics For All was the loud foghorn in the corner of the room. It was reaching tens of millions of people a month with its emoji-laden tweets where everything was treated as breaking news. It could shift narratives with a keen eye for highlighting details that other people had missed. And it also understood the fastest route to success on Twitter: aggressively stealing the work of mainstream journalists and rapidly repackaging it in a provocative format that takes advantage of every flaw in the site’s algorithm to maximise engagement with audiences. Or as another of the account’s former administrators put it: “We just looked at Twitter a lot. People think it was a massive organisation but it was basically ripping off people. The idea was to be first to nick it.” Politics For All was registered in 2019 by Nick Moar, a teenager from Bath, who clocked that the tactics used to cover football transfer news on Twitter – providing a one-stop rapid aggregation service of mainstream outlets with limited context – could be applied effectively to politics news. (Just to underline how its later success was mildly preposterous, the account’s username was actually @PoliticsForAli – with the “i” written in upper case – because someone else had already bagged @PoliticsForAll. This inevitably lead to a lot of speculation about who was Ali and why he wanted all this politics news.) Following a few early viral tweets, the account began to pick up momentum in early 2021. By the end of the year it had 450,000 followers and far more interactions than many mainstream news accounts. Its tweets were getting more than 80m views a month. The model was simple. When Moar or one his team saw a news story they felt would go viral, it would be rapidly shared with three 🚨🚨🚨 emojis, often rephrasing the original story to be more shareable. After waiting a few minutes to maximise engagement on the tweet, a link to the original source would be added – often to the annoyance of the full-time journalist who might have spent weeks doing the reporting but was getting less credit. Chris Lochery, one of the authors of the delectable media gossip newsletter Popbitch, memorably called Politics For All a “hungry little content piggy” after it tweeted out three of his stories in the space of an hour. It was essentially a modern twist on the traditional tabloid news model. Wright said Moar instinctively understood how news websites are full of information that might interest younger audiences – but this info is often hidden in dull news stories that are excessively long: “Some of the Times articles were really long-winded but he would find that nugget in the 12th paragraph that would make it go viral.” Potential admins – almost entirely teenagers and university students wanting to break into the media industry – would message the account and ask to be involved. A few test tweets later and they’d find themselves added to a WhatsApp group with fellow (essentially unpaid) staff and often given control of the main account, with the ability to tweet to hundreds of thousands of people. It was chaotic, unstructured, and somehow worked. Click, click… boom! Politics For All was often accused of leeching off the work of others and spreading disinformation with its framing of news stories. But talk to the individuals involved and they say the account was essentially a creation of Twitter’s own incentive structure. The challenge for the young men who ran the account – and it was almost an entirely male team – was to crack Twitter’s algorithm and maximise engagement, which would lead to more power and followers, which then led to further engagement. Many journalists get a thrill from pressing publish on a story they know will be big news. Wright found a similar level of enjoyment from aggregating other journalist’s stories on Politics For All: “It was just that buzz from clicking the button and typing a few words and just seeing the likes go up, seeing the retweets go up, seeing the follows go up.” This rapidly growing influence brought some issues, with the government increasingly concerned about what the teenagers were posting. One message posted in the admin WhatsApp group showed Moar had received complaints from a Downing Street adviser who was upset that the government had not given a right of reply to one of the Politics For All tweets. The admins were told it was “Carrie related”, a reference to the prime minister’s wife. The site also struggled to monetise, with admins given token payments of £50 when small sums of advertising cash arrived. Moar took a part-time job writing tweets for the right-leaning Spectator magazine and there was growing speculation about the service’s stated political impartiality. Ironically, multiple admins said Moar had actually been a Labour party member. (He declined to comment for this newsletter.) Wright was eventually asked to leave the service in the autumn. Shortly afterwards the account made some messy attempts at original reporting, including tweeting insider documents from the Salisbury rail crash without appropriate context. “They had a lot of power and they didn’t understand how to wield that power, it’s like a child like having all the candy,” said one former admin. “It provided a service but the service obviously altered and it felt slightly toxic. Everything was done for clicks.” Kept in the dark Earlier this month Twitter permanently banned Politics For All and its associated accounts without warning, citing its rules on platform manipulation – leading to suggestions that it may have engaged in excessively aggressive tactics to drive up engagement. But the admins remain in the dark, the social network has so far refused to elaborate on the reasons for the ban and there is no right to appeal. Westminster has noticed. Government officials have talked to the Guardian about whether the deletion of Politics For All is an issue that ministers should consider while framing journalistic protections in forthcoming online harms legislation. In some ways the flaw with Politics For All might have been that its approach was too refined, too obvious, and perhaps sailed too close to the wind. Two kids in a trenchcoat – or at least a group of teens with a WhatsApp group chat – worked out how to game Twitter, which is embarrassing for the social network. But these days many click-chasing mainstream news sites are also just rapid aggregators, ripping off anything resembling an exclusive from their rivals as fast as possible. Enormously popular news sites such as MailOnline operate on the same basis as Politics For All: humans like to consume provocative news stories and are rarely bothered about the original journalistic source. But perhaps most crucially, Politics For All reveals the motivation behind a lot of journalism in 2022: Posting online is addictive. As Wright puts it, aggregation of other people’s stories is just really fun: “I was trying to do reporting in London and asking people questions, but I was awful at it. But doing aggregation, I enjoyed a lot more.” If you want to read the complete version of the newsletter please subscribe to receive TechScape in your inbox every Wednesday.",News/Technology,TechScape: Inside the rise and fall of Politics For All,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/12/techscape-politics-for-all-twitter
1/12/2022,"Hong Kong’s leader has vowed to introduce a swathe of new security laws for the city, in an address opening the first legislative sitting since the “patriots only” election cemented the removal of opposition from government. Carrie Lam did not detail the new crimes that would be created in the planned “local legislation”, which would meet a constitutional requirement for Hong Kong to have its own national security law.  The requirement laid out in article 23 of Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, the Basic Law, lists treason, secession, sedition, subversion and theft of state secrets. Article 23 also prohibits foreign political organisations from conducting political activities in Hong Kong, or having ties with local political organisations. Hong Kong’s existing national security law was imposed by Beijing in June 2020, outlawing broadly defined acts as secession, foreign collusion, subversion and terrorism. Both Lam and Beijing had said it was necessary to impose the law because Hong Kong had not been able to pass its own – having faced opposition and protests over previous attempts. Beijing’s law has been used to arrest more than 150 people, including journalists and opposition politicians, amid a broader crackdown which has targeted thousands and sent others fleeing overseas after the mass pro-democracy protests of 2019 and 2020. The most recent iteration of the crackdown on dissent saw an electoral overhaul to ensure that “only patriots govern Hong Kong”, which the UK handed back to China in 1997, reducing residents’ democratic participation in the election of the legislative council and introducing extensive roadblocks to those who oppose the pro-Beijing government from running. The 20 December election saw the lowest voter turnout in decades and prompted several governments around the world to express concern about the “erosion of democratic elements” after pro-Beijing candidates took nearly every seat. In her speech on Wednesday, Lam said: “With the leadership and staunch support of the CG, Hong Kong was now back on the right track of one country, two systems.” With a chief executive election process scheduled for March, Lam pledged to use the rest of her tenure to establish a “constructive and interactive relationship” between government and the legislature, “to address longstanding problems in society in order one day to claim recognition from the public on the approved electoral system and build a bright future together”.",News/World news,Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam vows to bring in new security laws,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/12/hong-kong-leader-carrie-lam-vows-to-bring-in-new-security-laws
1/12/2022,"Andrew Lloyd Webber is calling for the government to recognise the transformative effect that classical music tuition can have the lives of children in disadvantaged communities. The award-winning composer of hits including Evita, Cats and Jesus Christ Superstar spoke of his despair over the lack of adequate public funding for music, despite its life-changing benefits.  He said: “We do know music empowers children. The evidence is that it absolutely improves academic standards [and] all aspects of behaviour because they’re having to take part in something … with other people and think of other people … It doesn’t have to be classical music … as Duke Ellington said, there’s two kinds of music, good and bad. “Drugs are greatly reduced in the schools where a music programme exists. Consider what the saving to the community is having children much more engaged. It’s not about necessarily turning them into musicians, but the fact that music is something that liberates kids.” Lloyd Webber said ministers did not seem willing to consider “the actual statistics”. “It is proven, but I’ve found, in dealing with this government, one’s been banging one’s head against a brick wall on so many issues – and this one is a no-brainer,” he added. He pointed to the work of the Music in Secondary School Trust (MiSST), which partners with schools in disadvantaged areas to provide regular classical music tuition. Its latest report, which will be published on Thursday, presents compelling statistics on the impact of such programmes on 11- to 18-year-olds, such as improving self-confidence and resilience. Its research shows MiSST students are “bucking the national trend”, with self-confidence, for example, increasing by more than 10% in schools that have the programme compared with those that do not. Lloyd Webber said: “At a time when schools are so under pressure that music teaching is at serious risk, programmes like MiSST are needed more than ever before.” MiSST was founded in 2013, after years of development at Highbury Grove school in Islington, north London, with the belief that young people’s lives could be transformed through high-quality music education. It provides 8,030 students with regular tuition and instruments through programmes that would otherwise not be available to them. But it trust is crying out for funds, with a waiting list of more than 30,000 children. The trust wants to develop the programmes beyond London, having so far reached Warwickshire, Oldham and Middlesbrough. Its education programme costs about £200 a year for each child. The Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation has donated £3.4m to the main MiSST programme and a further £100,000 to other activities. Lloyd Webber said: “We calculated that … it would only cost £300m to implement this scheme across all schools. This one is actually oven-ready. It’s ready to go, but we can’t do it all. It’s got to the point where many thousands of children in schools want to join this. But we haven’t got the resource to do it.” Rachel Landon, the chief executive of MiSST, said: “We’ve done this completely through philanthropy.” Having been turned down recently for government funds, the trust has submitted another proposal. At the moment, music training varies from one school to another, Landon said, adding: “We went to a school last year and they had no music whatsoever and now we’ve introduced the programme and it’s a really … amazing music department.” Lloyd Webber described the first concert he attended at Highbury Grove school as “one of the most extraordinary things that I’ve ever seen”. “There was [a] choir – where you’ve got [60] or more different languages spoken in the school – singing Mozart’s Ave Verum. Just on one level, you were seeing Muslims, Jews, Christians …singing and enjoying it … I felt we had to get ourselves involved[,” he said.",News/Education,Lloyd Webber calls for more music tuition funding in schools,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/12/lloyd-webber-calls-for-more-funding-for-music-tuition-in-schools-disadvantaged-communities
1/12/2022,"A man has been arrested in connection with the unsolved case of three British family members and a French cyclist who were killed in the French Alps in 2012. Saad al-Hilli, an engineer, his wife Ikbal and her mother, Suhaila al-Allaf, were gunned down on a forest road in Chevaline, near Lake Annecy. The couple’s two young daughters survived the attack.  A local cyclist, Sylvain Mollier, also died after being shot at point-blank range. No one has been charged over the attack. Judicial sources told French media that an unidentified man had been taken into custody and his home searched. The man’s movements and whereabouts on the day of the killings, as well as the days before and after, were being verified. Line Bonnet, the public prosecutor in Annecy, said in a statement that a person had been arrested shortly after 8am on Wednesday by police in Chambéry, adding that further details would be released later but that the investigation was covered by judicial secrecy laws. BFMTV said the suspect was a married man who had been questioned before as a witness. The arrest follows a detailed recreation of events by gendarmes in September, on the ninth anniversary of the murders Hilli’s then seven-year-old daughter, Zainab, was pistol-whipped during the attack, which police believe was a result of the killer running out of ammunition. Her sister Zeena, then four, hid in the footwell of the vehicle. Almost a decade after the killings, French and British police have so far failed to make any real progress in the case despite a massive effort involving officers on both sides of the Channel.

1/12/2022,"Hayley Mills has been given an Oscar statuette to replace the one that went missing from her London home in the late 1980s. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (Ampas), which hands out the Oscars, posted photographs on its social media feed showing Ampas president David Rubin presenting Mills with a replacement award.  Hayley Mills being reunited with her long lost Academy Juvenile Award (which she won for 1960's ""Pollyanna"") by AMPAS president David Rubin is the purest thing you'll see all day. pic.twitter.com/lVBc9hmlS3 Mills won the award – a half-sized statuette termed a “Juvenile Oscar” – aged 14 for her performance in the 1960 film Pollyanna, though as she was at boarding school in England she was unable to attend the ceremony and it was received on her behalf by Annette Funicello. She was the last actor to receive a Juvenile Oscar, which had been given out sporadically since 1934 with previous winners including Mickey Rooney, Shirley Temple and Judy Garland. However, Mills said that the statuette had vanished from her home in the UK while she was in the US making the Disney Channel show Good Morning, Mrs Bliss (which ran from 1988-89 and was the originator of the Saved by the Bell series). Mills told the Hollywood Reporter in September that the statuette “was taken”. She added: “I went to America to do a television show and when I came back, it had gone. Of course, I turned the house upside down, and I asked everybody I could think of, and I did everything I could … Maybe it will turn up one day.” In 2018 she told EW that “it’s not something you can replace … They’ve broken the mould. I spoke to the Academy, and I said, ‘Well, look, give me a big one then!’ They said, ‘I’m sorry, it doesn’t work like that.’” Mills, the daughter of established British star John Mills, had been spotted by the Walt Disney studios after her appearance alongside her father in the 1959 thriller Tiger Bay; after the success of Pollyanna, she starred in a string of Disney films including The Parent Trap and In Search of the Castaways, as well as British films such as Whistle Down the Wind and The Family Way.",Arts/Film,Hayley Mills has stolen Oscar replaced,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/12/hayley-mills-has-stolen-oscar-replaced
1/12/2022,"Good morning. Joe Biden gave his most forceful endorsement of changing the Senate filibuster rule in order to pass sweeping voting rights legislation, saying he was “tired of being quiet” in a high-profile speech in Georgia on Tuesday.  In one of the most significant speeches of his presidency, Biden drew a connection in history between the civil rights movement, the 6 January attack on the US Capitol by extremist supporters of Donald Trump, and the unprecedented efforts in many states to restrict the vote over the last year. He said America was at a moment to choose “democracy over autocracy”. But despite the passion, some prominent Georgia civil rights activists, proclaiming themselves more interested in action than speeches, declined to attend the event in Atlanta, where Biden and the vice-president, Kamala Harris, urged progress in Congress to pass key legislation currently stalled there. What did Kamala Harris say? Speaking before Biden, she said: “Do not succumb to those who would dismiss this assault on voting rights as an unfounded threat. The Senate must act.” The House select committee investigating the Capitol attack closed in on Donald Trump’s inner circle on Tuesday, issuing new subpoenas to three White House officials involved in planning the former president’s appearance at the rally that preceded the 6 January insurrection. The subpoenas show the select committee is moving ever nearer to Trump in its investigation and suggests the panel is examining whether the former president’s speech suggested that the White House had advance knowledge of plans to attack the Capitol. Congressman Bennie Thompson, the chair of the select committee, issued subpoenas to the former White House strategists Andy Surabian and Arthur Schwartz, suggesting they helped coordinate Trump’s appearance by communicating with the organizers and speakers at the rally. Thompson also authorized a subpoena for Ross Worthington, the former White House official who drafted the speech Trump delivered at the rally. What did Thompson say? “The select committee is seeking information from individuals who were involved with the rally. Protests that day escalated into an attack on our democracy.” The US recorded a record number of hospital admissions due to Covid-19, the Biden administration said, as daily infections soared to more than 1.35 million. Nonetheless, politics dominated a Senate hearing on the pandemic on Tuesday, as Republicans attempted to use the disease for political gain. Rand Paul of Kentucky clashed once again with Anthony Fauci, Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser. “In usual fashion, Senator, you are distorting everything about me,” Fauci said. “You keep coming back to personal attacks on me that have absolutely no relevance.” Paul, who has repeatedly used public health hearings for political grandstanding and launching personal attacks on Fauci, variously accused the immunologist of working to smear scientists and being responsible for school closures, while reiterating rightwing theories about the origin of Covid-19. Fauci has been subjected to death threats and said his family had been harassed “because people are lying about me”. How many cases of Covid are there in the US? According to Reuters there were 1.35 million new Covid infections on Monday, which is a record high. How many people with Covid are in hospital? There were 145,982 people hospitalised with coronavirus in the US on Monday, according to data from the Department of Health and Human Services. Reuters reported that the previous high was 132,051, set in January 2021. British prime minister Boris Johnson faces a make-or-break session of prime minister’s questions today, with furious Conservative MPs awaiting his explanation of the “bring your own booze” garden party in May 2020 when the UK was still in lockdown. A mass of Arctic air swept into the US north-east on Tuesday, bringing bone-chilling sub-zero temperatures and closing schools for the second time in less than a week. Schools in Massachusetts’ three largest cities, Boston, Worcester and Springfield, canceled classes. Protesters gathered in Fayetteville, North Carolina, for a second night in a row on Monday after a man was killed by an off-duty sheriff’s deputy. The man killed on Saturday was Jason Walker, a 37-year-old Black man who the deputy told authorities ran into traffic and jumped on to his vehicle. The landmark trial of a Greek sailing coach accused of raping a child has opened in Athens, a year after an Olympic champion effectively launched the #MeToo movement in the country by speaking out about her experiences. Coronavirus loses 90% of its ability to infect us within 20 minutes of becoming airborne – with most of the loss occurring within the first five minutes, the world’s first simulations of how the virus survives in exhaled air suggest. The findings re-emphasise the importance of short-range Covid transmission, with physical distancing and mask-wearing likely to be the most effective means of preventing infection. Ventilation, though still worthwhile, is likely to have a lesser impact. A study in 2017 said the single most effective action an individual could take in terms of helping the planet was having one fewer child; this would save more than 25 times the emissions of the next biggest undertakings (living without a car and avoiding long-haul flights). With the climate crisis becoming ever more urgent, a growing number of young, childless men are taking the drastic decision of being sterilised for environmental reasons. The bar, named 45 Wine and Whiskey, in a nod to Trump having served as the 45th president, promises handcrafted cocktails in “the most exclusive setting”. It serves a range of president-themed drinks and is, according to the marketing material, a place to “relax and unwind”. That may have been the intention, but a recent visit by the Guardian revealed it mainly serves as an ode to narcissism, or as a world record attempt to cram the most black-and-white photos of one man into quite a small space. American winters are rapidly warming and December 2021 was no exception. In New York, last month’s average temperature was 43.8F (6.5C) – 4.7F above the 1991-to-2020 average, according to analysis by Climate Central. The American south had an especially warm December, with Shreveport, Louisiana (+13.4F), Dallas, Texas (+13.2F), and Memphis, Tennessee (+12.4F). “Winter is the season when we don’t think about heat the way we do in July or August – this is a sign that we live on a planet that’s changing,” a scientist said. A landmine-hunting rat that was awarded a gold medal for heroism for clearing ordnance from the Cambodian countryside has died. Magawa, a giant African pouched rat originally from Tanzania, helped clear mines from about 225,000 sq m of land – the equivalent of 42 football pitches – over the course of his career. After detecting more than 100 landmines and other explosives, Magawa retired in June last year and died “peacefully” this weekend. First Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.
