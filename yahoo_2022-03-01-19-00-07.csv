3/1/2022,"Retired televangelist Pat Robertson resurfaced this week to make another in a long line of his doomsday predictions. This time, he returned to his “700 Club” show to claim that Russian President Vladimir Putin was being compelled by God to not only attack Ukraine, but use the country as a staging ground for a war against Israel to fulfill biblical prophecy: Pat Robertson came out of retirement to claim that Putin ""is being compelled by God"" to invade Ukraine in preparation for a massive End Times invasion of Israel. pic.twitter.com/Pmwybf57Ay — Right Wing Watch (@RightWingWatch) February 28, 2022 Robertson, who turns 92 this month, is a serial doomsday cheerleader. In the 1970s, he predicted a 1982 ending. In the 1990s, he predicted a 2007 ending. In 2020, he predicted Donald Trump would win reelection ― “without question” ― and it would lead to the end. (In that case, it wasn’t a war that would end the world, as he is currently predicting, but something a lot more natural, like an asteroid.) “It’s sudden destruction. It’s not going to be some nuclear war,” Robertson said, per USA Today. “We’re not going to be allowed to blow this earth up.” He also has a long history of hateful, divisive, racist and intolerant comments.

3/1/2022,"Fox News’ national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin again called out her own network’s questionable coverage of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. On Sunday, Griffin slammed retired U.S. Army Brigadier General Donald Bolduc’s on-air suggestion that America should provide more “combat help” to Ukraine as being “way off the mark in terms of talking about what the U.S. could do on the ground.” U.S. and NATO don’t have boots in Ukraine amid fears it could spark a nuclear war, Griffin noted. “The Ukrainians are very good fighters,” she said. “They are a tough group of fighters. They do not need Americans to fight for them. That would cause this to spread.” “Clearly, Brigadier General Bolduc is not a student of history,” she continued. “He’s a politician, he ran for Senate in New Hampshire and failed. He’s not a military strategist, and to suggest that the U.S. would put indirect fire or special operations or CIA on the ground to give Putin any sort of excuse to broaden this conflict is extremely dangerous talk at a time like this.” Watch the video here: More fact checking of guests from Jennifer Griffin: Clearly he isn’t a student of history.

I share those facts internally so that our network can be more accurate. That’s what I’ve always done.

3/1/2022,"BEIJING (Reuters) -A top Chinese official warned on Tuesday that China's economy faces multiple challenges at home and abroad this year, including ""huge"" pressure from uncertainty over global trade and from still-lacklustre domestic consumption. Foreign trade, which helped drive the world's second-largest economy last year, will be confronted by uncertain external demand and a high statistical base from 2021, said Commerce Minister Wang Wentao. ""This year, the pressure on foreign trade will be huge and the situation will be very severe,"" Wang said at a press conference. Labour shortages and high raw material costs have also heaped pressure on the ability of China's small and medium-sized companies to handle overseas orders, he said. Given the global uncertainties, China must ""do everything possible"" this year to spur domestic consumption, Wang said. Last year, the Chinese economy rebounded with its best growth in a decade, helped by robust exports and a resulting record trade surplus. But there were signs that momentum was slowing on weakening consumption and a domestic property downturn. In December, retail sales grew 1.7% from a year earlier, missing an average forecast of 3.7% and slowing from November's 3.9% gain. Some recovery momentum was seen in consumption in February after downward pressure since the fourth quarter, Wang said. Stability in all aspects of society is the watchword in China this year as the Communist Party gathers for a once-in-five-year congress in late 2022. President Xi Jinping is expected to claim his third term as leader of the party. China will aim to broaden access to its markets and draw more foreign investment into the country's industrial sector, including advanced manufacturing and strategic new industries, Wang said. Foreign direct investment grew in the double-digits in January-February, he said.

3/1/2022,"By Parisa Hafezi VIENNA (Reuters) -Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Tuesday the war in Ukraine should be stopped and accused the United States, which he called a ""mafia-like regime"", of creating the crisis. Iran's top political authority also said the roots of the conflict must be acknowledged. Khamenei criticised Washington and other Western nations as talks reached a critical stage in Vienna between Iran and world powers about reviving a 2015 nuclear deal. Iran said on Monday efforts to revive the pact could succeed if the United States took a political decision to meet Tehran's remaining demands, as months of negotiations enter what one Iranian diplomat called a ""now or never"" stage. The stakes are high, because the failure of 10 months of talks could carry the risk of a fresh regional war, more harsh sanctions on Iran by the West and continued upward pressure on world oil prices already strained by the Ukraine conflict. Iran's foreign ministry spokesman said the remaining issue were the extent to which sanctions would be rolled back, providing guarantees that the United States would not quit the pact again and resolving questions over uranium traces found at several old but undeclared sites in Iran. All parties involved in the talks say progress has been made toward the restoration of the pact to curb Tehran’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief, which the United States abandoned in 2018. But both Tehran and Washington have said there are still some significant differences to overcome. ""The United States is a regime that lives on crises ..., in my view, Ukraine is a victim of the crises concocted by the United States,"" said Khamenei. ""There are two lessons to be learnt here. States which depend on the support of the U.S. and Western powers need to know they cannot trust such countries. It is people that matter; if Ukrainians supported their government, the situation would have been different from the current crisis,"" he said.
