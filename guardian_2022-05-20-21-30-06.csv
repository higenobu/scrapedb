5/20/2022,"The Wagatha Christie libel trial opened with a cry of despair from Coleen Rooney’s barrister: “This whole court might just think: why on earth are we here?” After almost two weeks of court hearings, it was a question that many of those who took part or watched – including Rebekah Vardy, Coleen Rooney, two former England footballers, dozens of journalists, and the judge Mrs Justice Steyn – might have asked themselves at some point. (In reality the lawyers involved may have been content to be there, knowing they are set to share hundreds of thousands of pounds in fees.) But how did Rooney’s 2019 social media post alleging “Rebekah Vardy’s account” was leaking stories from a private Instagram account to the Sun spiral into this legal media circus? The simple answer, according to Rooney’s lawyer David Sherborne, is that Vardy decided to press on and bring her multimillion-pound libel claim against Rooney to court no matter what, declining offers of a mediated outcome in a bid to clear her name and restore her reputation. The more problematic answer is that the case exposed how – 15 years after social media went mainstream – English libel law is still struggling to deal with a world in which everyone is a publisher. This is a universe where unmediated idle chat on video streams reaches millions of people, where celebrities’ Instagram accounts have more readers than some national newspapers, and where some of the greatest legal minds of the country spend time debating the 😂 emoji. The trial showed that how we communicate as a society – and in turn make potentially defamatory accusations – has changed for good. Whether the legal system can cope with this is another matter. On the final day of the trial Hugh Tomlinson QC, acting for Vardy, complained that the media was full of jokes about the “ignorance of lawyers” on technical matters relating to the case. He was right – but that doesn’t mean the jokers don’t have a point. At another point Tomlinson repeatedly pushed Rooney during cross-examination by suggesting that a picture taken within the Instagram app and uploaded direct to its Stories function would have automatically saved to her camera roll. It was part of his wider point about how loss of evidence can affect anyone – but any teenager would be able to tell you that the “save to camera roll” feature is an optional function. Rooney, very much a millennial despite her two decades in the public eye, put him straight. Pages and pages of emoji-laden WhatsApp was analysed for meaning, with the legal document system struggling to process the various different forms of smiling face. At one point Rooney’s barrister Sherborne described a message sent by Vardy’s agent mocking Rooney, which ended with a series of “laughing emojis”. Vardy told the court she disputed this characterisation of the document: “I don’t know whether they’re laughing emojis.” Sherborne replied, somewhat dismissively: “OK, crying with laughter.” Some parts were perhaps more theatrical flourishes than ignorance, such as when Sherborne asked Vardy to explain what “FFS” meant in a WhatsApp message. Vardy awkwardly checked what she could say with the judge before replying: “For fucks’s sake.” Potentially the most crucial ruling in the entire case took place back in November 2020, when Rooney’s legal team unsuccessfully argued that the general public understood that celebrities shared the login details for their social media accounts with their agents. Mr Justice Nicklin disagreed, ruling that the true legal meaning of the post blaming “Rebekah Vardy’s account” was actually a direct accusation against Vardy herself. This allowed Vardy to argue at trial that – although it might have been her account that was used to do the leaking – her agent Caroline Watt was potentially acting unilaterally. People in government and prominent lawyers not involved in the case have been keeping a close eye on proceedings – partly because, like many of the rest of the public, they are voracious gossips. But there is a more serious concern that the proceedings are not a good advert for English legal system. They have been worried about the public mockery of how potential evidence was lost by Vardy and her agent, such as a phone being dropped off the side of a boat in the North Sea shortly after a request was made to search it. But most telling is how Rooney made her original accusation against Vardy. No one – not even her husband, Wayne – knew that she had been carrying out a sting operation by putting out fake Instagram updates and limiting the audience until only Vardy’s account remained. In the past Rooney might have taken the conclusions of her investigation to a friendly newspaper journalist, who would have consulted with the outlet’s lawyers about how best to report it, before going to Vardy for comment. Instead, Rooney wrote out her j’accuse letter by pen in a notepad, before asking her brother to upload it to Twitter. Much was made by Vardy’s lawyers of the fact she did not did not follow standard journalistic practice in failing to give advance warning to the subject of her story. It’s likely that a brief chat with a media lawyer on how to phrase the accusation could have saved Rooney a lot of trouble. But the legal system should consider whether this is realistic for most members of the public, what individuals are expecting when they post material on social media, and whether they should be held to the same standard as major news publishers. Because as things stand, it might not be very long before we get another Wagatha Christie case.",News/Law,Wagatha Christie puts England’s legal system on trial in the social media age,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/may/20/wagatha-christie-puts-englands-legal-system-on-trial-in-the-social-media-age
5/20/2022,"A teenager who downloaded guides to making bombs, and is thought to be the youngest person in the UK charged with terrorism offences, has not been given a custodial custody after being sentenced to three 12-month referral orders to run concurrently. The UK’s chief magistrate, Judge Paul Goldspring, sitting at Newton Aycliffe youth court in County Durham, said if the 14-year-old boy had been an adult, he would be facing a jail sentence of up to five years. The boy, from Darlington, downloaded substantial amounts of material on how to make weapons and bombs and how to start a militia. He expressed admiration for the Columbine High school massacre and in one social media post he talked about blowing up an orphanage. He had an interest in the far right and posted messages and material that was racist, homophobic and Islamophobic. He was 11 when he downloaded material about Adolf Hitler. The boy told the judge that it was all a fantasy and bravado, and that he would never have carried out the kind of attacks he talked about online. The court heard that the boy was on the autism spectrum. He first appeared at Westminster magistrates court in January when he admitted three counts of possessing material useful to a terrorist. The judge said the views the boy expressed were abhorrent.

5/20/2022,"An ancient forest has been found at the bottom of a giant sinkhole in China, with trees up to 40 metres (130ft) tall. Scientists believe it could contain undiscovered plant and animal species. Cave explorers in the Guangxi region of southern China alerted scientists when they found the sinkhole, which had a primitive forest inside. Among 30 sinkholes in Leye County this is the largest, at 306 metres long, 150 metres wide and 192 metres deep. Zhang Yuanhai, a senior engineer at the Institute of Karst Geology of the China Geological Survey, told the state news agency Xinhua that the site had three caves in its walls and a well-preserved primitive forest at the bottom. Scientists trekked for hours to reach the base of the sinkhole to see what it contained. Chen Lixin, who led the expedition team, said that as well as the trees there was dense undergrowth on the floor that came up to his shoulders. “I wouldn’t be surprised to know that there are species found in these caves that have never been reported or described by science until now,” he said. The sinkhole-filled landscape is known as a karst landscape, formed primarily by the dissolution of bedrock by groundwater. This means that dramatic sinkholes and caves are created throughout the area. This one is rare, however, as it is both deep but is shaped so enough light filters in, which means the large trees can grow.",News/Environment,Ancient forest found at bottom of huge sinkhole in China,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/20/ancient-forest-found-bottom-huge-sinkhole-china-guangxi
5/20/2022,"Downing Street’s demands that civil servants get back to the office has backfired for the Department for Education, where desk shortages have resulted in staff being sent home and others forced to work in “chaotic” conditions. Officials working in cramped corridors or sharing desks have led to protests from civil service unions to Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary, who last month ordered an end to working from home after pressure from the efficiency minister Jacob Rees-Mogg. The extent of the chaos was revealed by Schools Week which reported that Susan Acland-Hood, the DfE’s permanent secretary, has ordered staff to spend 80% of their time in the office – despite the DfE having twice as many staff as desks. Civil servants said the first week of the new policy was “chaotic” with staff milling around trying to find space to sit and canteen tables being taken up. One described the DfE’s Great Smith Street office as like “a tube station in rush hour” after the new policy was implemented. One said they had attended a meeting on a landing, describing the atmosphere as “less like the West Wing, and more like The Thick of It”. According to Schools Week, the DfE has 4,200 desks for 8,000 full-time staff in its 12 offices across England, including just 95 desks for nearly 300 staff in Bristol, and 24 desks for 110 staff in Leeds. It reported that some staff at DfE’s office in Sheffield were sent home because of overcrowding, as nearly 1,500 staff tried to use the 790 desks. As with many government departments, working from home was widely practised at the DfE before the pandemic. About 60% to 70% of DfE staff typically worked from home or had flexible working patterns on a daily basis, and in recent years the DfE’s office space has shrunk to reflect that. Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the union, said the new policy would affect recruitment and staff retention. “Our members have worked flexibly for many years and deserve to be treated with respect, not like naughty schoolchildren,” said Serwotka, who has written to Zahawi on behalf of his members. “To try to shame them back into the office when they have been working hard and successfully at home throughout the pandemic is bad enough. “But when there aren’t enough desks – when it’s not physically possible – looks like the action of a bully.” The First Division Association, which represents senior civil servants, said it had been “inundated” with complaints from its members. “We are also aware of members whose pre-pandemic flexible working arrangements are now deemed unacceptable, which is impacting working parents and those with caring responsibilities,” the FDA’s Helen Kenny told Schools Week. Zahawi’s decision to push staff back into the office followed the DfE coming bottom of a league table of in-person attendance, compiled by Rees-Mogg. Last month, it was revealed that Rees-Mogg had been leaving notes on empty desks in Whitehall, as part of an effort to shame civil servants back into the office. Stephen Morgan, Labour’s shadow schools ministers, said: “Instead of acting as glorified hall monitors, ministers should be spending their time tackling the day-to-day challenges children and teachers are facing.” The DfE has been contacted for comment.",News/Education,Push for civil servants to return to office backfires as DfE runs out of desks,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/20/department-for-education-desk-shortage-staff-working-chaotic-conditions
5/20/2022,"The Bank of England will intensify its squeeze on the economy over the coming months as it seeks to bring down the highest inflation rate in 40 years, its chief economist has warned. Noting that Threadneedle Street was facing its toughest challenge since being granted independence in 1997, Huw Pill said “further work needs to be done” to bring the annual inflation rate back to the government’s 2% target. Inflation soared to 9% in April as the rising cost of gas and electricity pushed household energy bills to record levels and the escalating cost of food and transport also contributed to the surge in the cost of living. The Bank’s nine-strong monetary policy committee has raised borrowing costs at its last four meetings but Pill used a speech in Cardiff to signal further increases were needed to prevent high inflation from becoming embedded in the economy. “In my view, we still have some way to go in our monetary policy tightening, in order to make the return of inflation to target secure,” Pill said. The Bank’s latest forecasts for the economy envisage the annual inflation rate rising above 10% in the Autumn – a forecast Pill admitted did not make “pretty reading”. Pill added the impact of high inflation on the poorest households made it all the more important for the Bank to act. “These are difficult times for many people, especially for the less well off, who spend a higher proportion of their income on energy and food, where recent price rises have been most significant. “Current challenges are thus a salutary reminder of the importance of price stability as an anchor for wider economic stability, and a bulwark to sustaining people’s livelihoods, especially for those on lower pay and fixed incomes.” The Bank cut official interest rates to a record low of 0.1% during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 but has since pushed them up to 1%. Pill said the risks of knock-on effects from high inflation were “obvious” and it was now time to remove emergency support for the economy and move back to a higher level of interest rates. “It is the need for a continuation of this transition in monetary policy that led me to support the 0.25 percentage point hike in bank rate at the May MPC meeting. And, even after this hike, I still view that necessary transition as incomplete. Further work needs to be done.” Pill said there was a tension between two opposing forces. On the one hand inflation was “clearly too high”, unemployment low and wage growth inconsistent with hitting the inflation target. On the other, hefty global rises in the cost of food and fuel were eating into consumer spending power. “Looking beyond the shorter term, UK inflation is set to fall as global commodity prices stabilise, bottlenecks in global supply chains ease, and domestic inflationary pressure dissipates as the real income squeeze opens up a margin of economic slack,” Pill said.",News/Business,Chief BoE economist: we’ll squeeze economy more to tame inflation ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/20/bank-of-england-chief-economist-squeeze-economy-tame-inflation
5/20/2022,"Tis the season for peonies, hay fever and wardrobe dilemmas. Everyone I talk to this time of year has a burning what-should-I-wear issue. It could be a wedding, or an ends-in-a-zero birthday party. Summer has always been peak season for what-to-wear fever because summer events are – or can be – the best of the best. When a summer wedding or party is really good, it’s like a mini-holiday. A fortnight’s worth of sunshine and laughter – and quite often a fortnight’s worth of rosé – knocked back in an afternoon like a shot of tequila. Magic. This summer, the what-to-wear question feels more urgent than ever. After two summers of cardigan-swaddled picnics, we are not at the top of our dress-up game. And with a 26-month backlog of babies, engagements and graduations to celebrate, a wardrobe challenge is likely to be heading your way soon. Summer parties have always been the trickiest to dress for. First, because they are – see above – potentially the best parties of all. So, you know, no pressure. Second, playing poker with a capricious climate is a national sport in Britain, so a summer party will almost always be outside. Third, there remains a sort of pageantry to summer events – from hats at Ascot to flower crowns at Glastonbury, from wedding white to carnival brights – that feels like pressure to get it right. Anyway, the answer to your question – about what to wear to The Thing – is a Play Suit. Not a playsuit as in a short-legged version of a jumpsuit, but a Play Suit as distinct from a Work Suit. A suit, but colourful, and worn for fun, not the 9-to-5. I went to a wedding recently where the chief bridesmaid wore a vintage lilac trouser suit with a cream corset top. Sensational. And at almost every chic event I’ve been to this spring, the trouser suit in a deliberately NSFW colour has been the star. An after-hours trouser suit for women has traditionally meant something black and rakish in the vein of Yves Saint Laurent’s Le Smoking, which is a fabulous look but doesn’t sit with the sweetness of mood a summer party calls for. But in fuchsia pink or sage green? A whole new vibe. Instead of a blouse, wear something fitted and sleeveless underneath: a camisole, a corset, even a matching waistcoat. With any new look, there is still a perfect moment to catch a wave. Had you worn a pastel trouser suit to a wedding in 2019, you would probably have stuck out like a sore thumb among the gingham puff-sleeve midi dresses. Wear one in 2023 and you will be one of a crowd. On the red carpet they are being worn by everyone from the Duchess of Cambridge to Zendaya, so those around you will recognise the suit as a blue-tick party look – but most of them will still be wearing dresses. People will look at you, but they won’t raise their eyebrows in alarm. Reiss, haute high-street spiritual home of the wedding-guest dress, has pivoted to majoring in coloured trouser suits – my top tip if you’re thinking of investing in a new look. Its hyacinth-blue Cora suit (£250 for the jacket, £150 for the trousers) is elegantly tailored with padded shoulders and a peaked lapel bringing subtle party energy. Its lemon-yellow Etna suit (£268 for the jacket, £168 for the trousers) has a slightly softer, patch-pocketed, notch-lapelled blazer and sensuously curved flares. Both are Bridgerton-level pretty, but way cooler than any ballgown. A summer dress is still as pretty as a picture. But the Play Suit is the look you will have the most fun in.Hair and make up: Sophie Higginson using Susanne Kauffman and Chantecaille. Model: Lydia at Body London. Suit: Veronica Beard.

5/20/2022,"Child survivors of the Manchester Arena bomb are still suffering from the attack five years on, with some “re-traumatised” by “really shocking examples of poor support” provided by schools and GPs, a researcher has found. Some have been made to take part in exercises in class without warning, involving how and where to hide if a gunman enters their school, according to Dr Cath Hill, a social worker and lecturer at Lancaster University leading research into the support provided after the 2017 attack. Others have struggled to access psychological support, despite problems with sleeping and acute anxiety – particularly those not physically hurt by Salman Abedi’s suicide bomb, which killed 22 people and injured 260 others. Sunday will mark five years since the attack. Hill was at the Arena on 22 May 2017 for the Ariana Grande concert with her then 10-year-old son. They escaped physically unscathed but with “psychological scars which occur when you fear for your life and survive when others have died”. To cope with the trauma and the guilt that followed, she set up the Manchester Survivors Choir, offering singing therapy for others in the same position. About 100 survivors have sung with the group since 2018, including the grandfather of Olivia Campbell-Hardy, who died in the bombing aged just 15. Hill is soon to launch Bee the Difference, a research project co-designed with nine of the young survivors and supported by the National Emergencies Trust and Lancaster University. Those involved include Lucy Jarvis, who at the age of 17 almost bled to death after lying on the floor after the attack for two hours, and Catherine Burke, who was just 10 when she suffered shrapnel wounds, broke a leg and lost her hearing in one ear. Launching in July at the start of the school summer holidays, the project will invite the many thousands of survivors of the Manchester Arena attack to fill in a questionnaire about the support they received, in order to improve the response to future attacks. From talking to other survivors, Hill was concerned to learn that the mental health support offered was “very, very patchy, if not overall lacking for the majority of young people”. She heard some “really shocking examples of really poor support, and support re-traumatised children along the way”. One girl was left alone in the school’s pastoral room a few days after the attack with the radio playing news about the attack, said Hill. “There are other examples of young people in schools doing some sort of drills for if there was a significant event in the school, and not being warned. They were told to hide under desks and in cupboards to prepare for an attack,” she added. But another girl, who attended a private school, said she got help the day after the attack from her school’s in-house counsellor. Abi Quinn, who was 12 when she went to the Ariane Grande concert, also helped design Bee the Difference. She had to wait more than six months for counselling and only received it after her mum wrote to their local MP in Liverpool. “I couldn’t sleep at night and was constantly in fear about it happening again,” she said. An unsympathetic GP made her feel unworthy of support. “She was like, ‘oh, you weren’t injured, you’ll be fine’. I felt pushed aside.” She said she wanted to help those who had yet to receive support and to help others “if, God forbid, it happens again”. Hill said: “If another attack that targeted young people happened again, today, I’m not certain how much we’ve learned. I’m sure some individuals have learned about how to support children and young people, perhaps some school teachers and some GPS, but there isn’t a general sense of learning within the community and with disasters and emergency planning.”",News/UK news,Child survivors of Manchester Arena attack ‘re-traumatised by poor support’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/20/child-survivors-of-manchester-arena-attack-re-traumatised-by-poor-support-says-researcher
5/20/2022,"Danny Boyle is sitting in his kitchen sounding faintly surprised that his latest project has been made at all. “It’s so not the story that everybody wants to be told,” he says, “but it is the story that should be told.” Pistol, a six-part miniseries, certainly isn’t the first drama about the Sex Pistols. There was Alex Cox’s 1986 movie Sid and Nancy, as well as The Great Rock’n’Roll Swindle – a game attempt by the band’s manager Malcolm McLaren to claim the whole thing was a brilliantly orchestrated money-making scheme. But Boyle’s is by far the most ambitious. It is based on Lonely Boy: Tales from a Sex Pistol, Steve Jones’s fantastic, occasionally harrowing autobiography, which takes readers from the guitarist’s horrendous childhood (he was sexually abused by his stepfather) to that infamous, expletive-filled appearance the band made on ITV’s Today show. It then covers the notoriety that followed, including the band’s messy collapse during a US tour and the horrific aftermath, which culminated in bassist Sid Vicious dying of a heroin overdose while on bail, charged with the murder of his girlfriend, Nancy Spungen. The series features a high-profile young cast: Maisie Williams, best known as Arya Stark in Game of Thrones, plays Jordan, the fearsome sales assistant in McLaren and Vivienne Westwood’s boutique Sex; while Louis Partridge, star of Netflix’s hugely successful Enola Holmes, is Sid Vicious. There are some striking performances: Anson Boon doesn’t look much like Johnny Rotten, but he’s got his voice and mannerisms eerily accurate; likewise Thomas Brodie-Sangster as McLaren. Moreover, it’s funded – and here’s an image for anyone who can remember the furore the Sex Pistols once caused – by Disney. Its making was controversial and demanding, too. There was Covid, of course, and a court case brought by furious frontman John Lydon, AKA Johnny Rotten, to prevent the band’s music being used. Then there were the specific challenges of working with a cast largely too young to remember the 1990s, let alone the 1970s. “None of them knew what a Trimphone was,” says Boyle, speaking by Zoom. “They couldn’t work out how to put the receiver back on the cradle.” Eighteen-year-old Partridge tells me he wasn’t entirely sure who Vicious was before he went for the part: had he been fully aware, he might not have auditioned with his mum reading the part of Nancy. “I went as Sid Vicious to a dress-up day at school once,” he says. “But I went as what I thought he looked like – so I put my hair in a mohican. I’d heard about him, just the hearsay and infamy. Other than that, I knew nothing.” But it wasn’t so much the problems the production encountered that makes its completion seem miraculous. Boyle seems more surprised that Pistol got commissioned in the first place, particularly by a Disney-owned channel, namely FX. For one thing, he says, the saga is a complex one that doesn’t lend itself to straightforward storytelling: all its major characters are deeply flawed and there’s no obvious hero. Nor – with its swastikas and senseless violence, its ambiguous songs about abortion and concentration camps, its sex-addicted, kleptomaniac guitarist and its bassist who may or may not have stabbed his partner to death – isn’t one that sits easily in the latterday moral climate. “You just have to wind your way through,” says Boyle, “and hope your actors make them feel believable. And therefore you’ll empathise, because of what they’re going through and because they make themselves understandable. One of the advantages of streaming is that it’s willing to take on board that kind of complexity – and look for the attachment of the audience not through quite such easy tropes: the lovable one, the hero moment where he’s not quite as bad as you thought he was.” It’s obvious Boyle is personally invested in the Sex Pistols’ story. He was 20 in 1976, more of a Clash fan than a Pistols devotee, though he genuinely believes the latter band altered the landscape of British life. “The biggest thing I remember is that your life was ‘timed’. You realised you became your father – that was partly to do with class, but it was true in different ways in all classes. It was very clear you were going to inherit something, whether you liked it or not. “And what the Sex Pistols introduced, by their profanity and disrespect and vileness, was a break point that said: ‘No – you can do whatever the fuck you want with your life. If you want to waste it, waste it. Be vacant, be futile, be fucking hopeless, disgust everyone. But it’s yours – you do what you want with it.’ In retrospect, you realise that’s what made the difference – people never went back to that sense of stepping into your father’s shoes and following him into the factory.” Boyle’s enthusiasm was evidently infectious. Partridge has become something of an expert on Vicious, after a crash course that involved “reading books, watching documentaries, speaking to former Sex Pistols and people who were around”. He also had to learn bass – Boyle insisted the actors perform their material live – but would then have to “rough up” what he’d been taught to match Vicious’s famous level of semi-competence on the instrument. Emma Appleton, who plays Spungen, also became fascinated by a character she knew almost nothing about. Spungen is regularly painted as the one unequivocal villain in the Pistols story: a heroin-addicted American groupie whose impact on Vicious and the band was so ruinous McLaren attempted to have her kidnapped and forcibly returned to the US, and whose murder McLaren and Westwood memorialised in a T-shirt. But Spungen, says Appleton, was mentally ill at “a time when people didn’t understand mental illness like we do now”, and deserves a more nuanced understanding. “I’ve always got a love for people I believe are misunderstood. It’s easy for there always to be a villain. But why are they the way that they are? wWhy do they behave the way that they do?, How can we have a more empathetic angle? She was a kid. I wanted to do her justice.” Not all the subjects of Pistol are overjoyed at its existence. Lydon first lost that court case to prevent the band’s music being used, then blasted the finished product (or rather a 42-second trailer) as “a middle-class fantasy … a fairytale, which bears little resemblance to the truth”. Calling his former bandmates “dead wood”, he added: “None of these fucks would have a career but for me.” For his part, the director remains unstinting in his praise for a man who has taken to calling him “Boyle on the bum”. He says: “Oh, he’s the genius. I mean, obviously, you can’t make a series about him because he’s unmanageable. Everyone knows that. So to get this book from Steve is like a side door in. It allows you to look at the whole group. But you have to acknowledge there’s a genius in there and it’s Rotten. He’s the person that changed everything, a key cultural figure in our landscape. I love Lydon for what he does and I don’t want him to like it – I want him to attack it. I think that’s his absolute right. Why would you change the habit of a lifetime?” Boyle “doesn’t know” if the story has relevance today. “I’m too old for that, really,” he says. “It’s certainly not the reason why we did it.” Yet the saga does have a modern resonance. We’ve heard a lot about cancel culture in recent years, but few pop stars in history were subjected to quite such a concerted attempt at cancellation as the Sex Pistols: banned from TV and radio, unable to play live unless under a pseudonym, with members of the Transport and General Workers’ Union at EMI striking rather than handle their records. And then there were the sales figures allegedly fiddled to prevent them getting to No 1, with a blank space displayed in the singles charts where God Save the Queen should have been. The story also seems to touch on the very modern-sounding topic of confected outrage and its consequences, as well as celebrities having to contend with high levels of public scrutiny. “PUNISH THE PUNKS!” ran a Sunday Mirror headline in 1977, a week before Johnny Rotten was attacked by a machete-wielding gang outside a London pub. “I can’t see how [the scrutiny] wouldn’t have touched them,” says Appleton. “It undoubtedly would have – it’s life-changing. And now it’s on a scale people wouldn’t have been able to comprehend back then.” Boyle is refreshingly frank about what may be the limits of Pistol’s appeal. After all, he says, it’s a very British story, rooted in the grimy minutiae of mid-1970s London and its music scene. “FX have been brilliant, but I don’t know how much it resonates in America. No matter how skilfully we manipulate the story, I don’t see how it will automatically appeal to a huge demographic. I’ve no idea how they’ll get it to appeal to people. I can’t figure that out at all.” Then he smiles, as if possessed by one of the lessons he learned from the Sex Pistols. “I just know you make things like this for yourself, which sounds terribly selfish, but it’s obvious. You can’t really do it any other way.” Pistol is on Disney+ from 31 May",Arts/Television & radio,‘I want Johnny Rotten to attack it!’ Danny Boyle on his shocking Sex Pistols saga ,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/20/i-want-johnny-rotten-to-attack-it-danny-boyle-on-his-shocking-sex-pistols-saga
5/20/2022,"A concert in a Derbyshire cave had to be abandoned when a concert-goer got lost en route and ended up falling into the cavern, managing to hold on to a tree on the way down. The man got into “extreme difficulties” trying to find the show in Peak Cavern in Castleton, known locally as the Devil’s Arse. He had to be hauled to safety in a “rescue nappy”, curtailing a concert by comedy singer-songwriter John Shuttleworth. Edale mountain rescue was called to help Derbyshire constabulary rescue the man on Thursday night, who was dangling 100ft (30m) above the cavern shortly before 9pm. He later told rescuers he had been following his satnav while walking from his accommodation and somehow ended up on a footpath above the cavern. “He came into extreme difficulties and slipped, just managing to catch a tree to arrest his fall, inches from a 100ft drop to the cavern floor,” Edale mountain rescue said in a Facebook post. “Unfortunately the concert had to be cancelled, and people had to be evacuated from the area due to the danger of rocks being dislodged on to the concert goers below.” The rescuers rigged up a rope rescue system and lowered a volunteer down to reach the man, where he was secured in what Mountain Rescue called a “rescue nappy”. “The gentleman had suffered a cut and some bruising above one of his eyes, other than that he seemed fit and well.

5/20/2022,"It’s 25 years since New Labour told us: “We’re all middle class now” and it’s not a claim that’s weathered well. Class is squarely back on the agenda these days: Athena Kugblenu’s new standup show on the subject follows ones by Kai Samra, Jason Manford and Sophie Willan among many others – and builds on her own, similarly themed Radio 4 broadcast. Kugblenu delves here into her own conflicted class identity, the child of an aspirational Indian-Caribbean mum and an overqualified Ghanaian dad who struggled to find even menial work in the UK. Does that make her working class? She’s not so sure. What you can be sure of, in any standup show on this theme, are relatable observational gags about – well, it’s usually quinoa and smashed avocados, but here we get Nigella recipes, granite worktops and the babyccino. Familiar class signifiers all, but Kugblenu’s show gets stronger when the references get less familiar and more specific to her own life, growing up in East Finchley, poring over the itemised phone bill for potential savings – but blissfully ignorant that there was anything lower than middle class about her happy, confident life. Her reflections are the richer for intersecting with race, as the 40-year-old marvels at the low academic demands she discovered, while working for Ofsted, that some white working-class parents made on their kids. (Cue amusing comparison with her own, second-generation immigrant experience.) Latterly, the show focuses on Kugblenu the new mum, concerned – as Chris Rock was last week – to ensure her kids aren’t spoiled by the privilege she has grafted to secure for them. The conclusion to which all this leads, using her parents’ migrant experience to flip conventional class thinking on its head, is striking. But not all of the earlier thinking is as pointed. When Kugblenu asserts that “Class isn’t about what you have, it’s about who you are,” she gets at something interesting about the complexities of these categorisations. But the thought is undeveloped. We’re left with a show that ruminates engagingly and with intermittent insight on class, and addresses with likable honesty Kugblenu’s confused relationship with it.

5/20/2022,"Some months ago, after waging a shameless and one-sided year-long campaign, I received a cake from Tom Cruise. The legend goes that he does this to hundreds of people every Christmas: his crews, his castmates, obnoxious journalists without any basic dignity, they all receive a large white chocolate bundt (and Christmas tree decoration) in a box. It was a lovely gift. But something about it nagged away at me. Was it really from Tom Cruise? Did Cruise one day sprint into his manager’s office, slam down a rolled-up copy of the Guardian and yell: “This kid wrote about me eating some curry. Send him a cake! Send him two!”? Or did Tom Cruise have absolutely nothing to do with it? Did all my hard work simply trigger a Google alert in a publicist’s office somewhere? This week, the London premiere of Top Gun: Maverick took place in Leicester Square. It was a vast event, complete with what appeared to be several dozen red carpets, the most important of which led to the centrepiece of the event; a full-blown fighter jet. The place was crowded beyond all comprehension, both with screaming Tom Cruise fans and tourists irritated that they had to go the long way round to Burger King. And, at least in the eyes of my employers, the premiere presented the perfect opportunity to redress the balance. What if I attended the event, with an elaborate cake that I had baked myself, and presented it to Tom Cruise? It would be great, we thought. I could do something polite and generous, and at the same time scrutinise Tom Cruise’s body language for the tiniest glimmer of recognition. Everyone would win. However, things did not go exactly according to plan. Just as I was deciding what sort of cake to make – a white chocolate bundt of my own, perhaps – my editor got in touch: given this was a royal premiere, the PRs were unlikely to facilitate a cake handover. And honestly, why would they? Top Gun: Maverick is a huge film for Tom Cruise. It’s a sequel, 36 years in the making, to one of his most iconic hits. It was meant to come out three years ago. It has been rapturously received by critics. The premiere was his big night. Who could blame him for not wanting to spend it with a Tupperware tub balanced on his lap? But I didn’t get where I am today without always having a plan B up my sleeve. Security at the event was extremely tight, so I was never going to be able to sneak a full-sized cake in. But I was wearing a tuxedo. A tuxedo with a jacket pocket. A jacket pocket big enough to comfortably hide a Wagon Wheel. I’d pass Tom Cruise in the lobby of the cinema, and say: “Hi, I’m Stuart Heritage”. And he’d say: “I know you, I sent you two cakes.” And I’d say: “Please allow me to return the favour by gifting you this Wagon Wheel I bought at Lidl on the way home from the school run this morning.” And he’d say: “Wait a minute, I gave you two cakes.” And then I’d give him the other Wagon Wheel I had in my pocket, because I think of everything, and we’d become best friends. However, this also failed to shake out the way I intended. The various red carpets, it turns out, operated on a hierarchy. One for the stars of the film, another for the celebrity guests, and the one for people nobody cares about. That’s the one I went on. I was 50 metres away from Tom Cruise in distance, but several thousand light years away in status. The closest I got to him, in fact, was when the film began. Cruise walked on stage and gave a little speech about how thrilled he was to be in London. I brought along my brother Pete, surly and sleep-deprived after a big night out, and in that moment he verbalised a thought that also popped into my head: “Wing a Wagon Wheel at his head”. Better sense prevailed: I didn’t want to be put to sleep by a minder. Plus, Thursday was one of the hottest days of the year. When I reached into my jacket pocket after the film, the Wagon Wheels had warped and melted and essentially formed themselves to the shape of my ribcage. By no stretch of the imagination would it have been a fitting way to return Tom Cruise’s favour. But I am determined. Tom Cruise did a nice thing for me, so I still maintain that I need to do a nice thing back. Tom, if you’re reading, the Wagon Wheels came from a multipack. I still have four left. Just say the word and they’re yours.",Arts/Film,Mission impossible?

5/20/2022,"At a recent online gathering of top Chinese economists, a palpable sense of urgency filled the virtual meeting room. In recent weeks, a slew of reports by Chinese and foreign economists pointed to a deteriorating economy. Outside the country, talk of China being the engine of global economic growth no longer convinces. During the meeting Huang Yiping, a Peking University professor and a former central bank adviser, urged Beijing to “do whatever it takes to save the economy”. Huang was paraphrasing a line from the height of the European debt crises more than a decade ago, when the European Central Bank’s then president, Mario Draghi, said it was ready to “do whatever it takes to preserve the euro”. Huang suggested: “Cashflow problems have shown up for many enterprises and households. More direct support is needed for affected companies and people.” His remarks have resonated with locked-down social media users after reports of the meeting were released on Sunday. “[He’s] a courageous Chinese intellectual,” one wrote on WeChat. China’s economy is struggling. This week, official data showed a sharp fall in economic activity in the past month, as lockdowns confined hundreds of millions of consumers to their homes and hit supply chains. Retail sales in April shrank more than 11% from a year earlier – the biggest contraction since March 2020, shortly after the Covid outbreak. In March, the premier, Li Keqiang, pledged to grow China’s GDP this year at “around 5.5%” – the lowest official target in three decades. However, Fitch ratings earlier this month cut China’s 2022 forecast GDP growth further, to 4.3% from 4.8%. Meanwhile, according to state media, fiscal revenues plunged last month across Chinese cities as a result of Covid lockdown measures. On Friday, the People’s Bank of China cut a key mortgage interest rate from 4.6% to 4.45% – a record amount – to support the property sector by reducing home loan costs across the country. However, there are growing calls for it to do more. Winnie Zhang, a product design senior at Shanghai’s Jian Qiao University, is one of the millions of young Chinese feeling the pinch by the current economic situation. She is about to graduate from the university but is struggling to find work. “Some companies have stopped sending out offers, or they are only having one round of interviews,” she told the Guardian. Zhang said a lot of companies that have received applications haven’t responded, and many said explicitly that they were not looking for employees to work remotely. “I think graduates this year would think they have more pressure in job hunting compared with graduates in 2017 and 2016.” A record 10.76 million graduates are expected to enter the job market this year, according to official figures – 1.67 million more than in 2021, which itself was a record. Recent surveys on postgraduate employment found economic prospects declining, with available jobs falling to 0.88 a student in the fourth quarter of 2021. Average monthly salaries in 2022 are down about 12% from 2021. Recent stringent lockdown measures in major cities, such as Shanghai, have made things worse. In April, according to China’s official data, the unemployment rate rose to 6.1% – the highest level since February 2020. Nancy Qian, an economics professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, said the real unemployment situation may actually be worse because of the different ways Chinese statistics count joblessness. “There are just not enough jobs to start with, as the economy began to slow a few years ago,” Qian said. “This is really binding China now and there’s no quick fix. And to create more jobs, Beijing has to open up its markets. But Covid, Ukraine as well as US-China geopolitical tensions are making it less likely in the short term.” Chinese commentaries this month have frequently raised the need for stability – not only social and political stability but primarily economic stability. China’s premier, who for a long time was thought by analysts to be out of favour with President Xi Jinping, has become more vocal about the need to grow the economy. Last month, Li – who is to step down upon finishing his second term in March 2023 – spoke openly during a tour of Jiangxi in eastern China of his support for entrepreneurs, many of whom have in last year expressed dismay amid Xi’s various crackdowns on the private sector. “We support entrepreneurs and innovation,” Li told the crowd, adding he was particularly keen to see young people start their own businesses. The premier, a longtime technocrat with a law degree and a doctorate in economics from Peking University, has had big ambitions to transform the country’s debt-driven economy, according to interviews with people familiar with him. However, they said it has been difficult for him to achieve much, given the current mood music, where politics seems to take a front seat. Optimists see signs that, with internal as well as external pressures, efforts to boost market confidence is more preferred within the ruling Communist party – at least for now. “It seems China is back in its classic conundrum: political priorities v economic priorities,” Qian said. “Every country faces that trade-off but in China this pair of contradictions has been salient ever since the founding of the People’s Republic in 1949.” She added: “In the short-term, Beijing’s prioritisation of ideology – or ‘politics in command’ – will continue to make headlines. But in the long run, the current economic situation and social dynamics may be forcing party elites to refocus on ‘economy in command’.” However, Prof Shaun Breslin of Warwick University, the author of the book China Risen?, argued the party’s political instinct has always been about short-term logic of social – and therefore political – stability. “And it always seems to trump longer-term arguments about the wisdom of fundamental economic restructuring,” he said. On Tuesday, the vice-premier Liu He and the fourth highest-ranking party member Wang Yang met senior tech entrepreneurs at a symposium to reaffirm their support for the private sector as well as tech IPOs at home and abroad. But the two senior leaders also reminded the companies of the need to align with government goals. “The danger is that after rounds of crackdowns on private businesses [in the past two years], would the entrepreneurs still be willing to play ball, or would they be wary that any new freedoms given now might simply be taken away again in the future?” Breslin said. At the meeting of economists where Huang spoke, there was no explicit criticism of the government’s approach to Covid. Speakers talked of how the government should boost production while controlling outbreaks. Then, mid-speech, Prof Yu Yongding, a respected government adviser who had been staying at home for the past fortnight, was reminded to do another Covid test. “I’ve done nucleic acid tests for more than 10 days non-stop. Here’s another pop-up notification. I’ll have to negotiate with them. I’m sorry to end my talk like this,” he told the audience, who burst into laughter.

5/20/2022,"They once lit up summer nights, people read by their luminescence and they’ve been celebrated by everyone from William Shakespeare to Crowfoot, a 19th-century North American chief. But glowworms have had their lights dimmed by a cult of tidiness in the countryside, the loss of wild meadows and light pollution. Now, hundreds of glowworms (Lampyris noctiluca) are being bred in captivity for release in two locations this summer, in an attempt to revive the declining species. More than 500 glowworm larvae have already been set free in the grounds of Elvetham hotel in Hampshire, where wildflower meadows and nature-friendly scrubland is being restored. Hundreds more larvae, and some glowing adults, will be released at the hotel again this summer, and at Combeshead in Cornwall, a rewilded farm and glamping site. The four-year project is led by the ecologist Derek Gow, who owns Combeshead and has been responsible for successful schemes to return water voles and beavers to the British countryside. “These wee things were objects of delight,” said Gow. “Within a lifetime, people can remember a parent bringing one into their bedroom in a jam jar and lying in bed watching them glow. They were everywhere, twinkling their way through eternity. With overgrazing and hedge-flaying and tidying up the countryside we’ve turned their lights out.” Glowworms are not worms but beetles and only the flightless female glows, to attract a male on summer nights. Although the males fly, the species is notoriously bad at dispersing, and so becomes trapped in small areas of suitable habitat. The larvae – a gardener’s friend, being voracious predators of snails – take two years to mature, which leaves them susceptible to being destroyed by increasingly intense meadow management, with regular cuts for silage and hay. A 2021 scientific study found that the abundance of glowworms declined markedly with increased proximity to artificial lighting. Not only do night lights bamboozle the female-seeking males, but they can cause the females to dim their lights. The flightless female will also not move away from light pollution. Taran Matharu, co-owner of Elvetham hotel and children’s author, said he was inspired to fund the reintroduction effort after discovering the hotel could have inspired William Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream – which features glowworms – after a lavish three-day summer party was held there for Elizabeth I. “This is a fairytale castle in southern England, and we wanted to make the garden like a fairytale, so I thought why not bring back England’s only native glowing insect?” said Matharu. He contacted numerous insect breeders who told him it was impossible to breed glowworms at scale in captivity, before discovering Gow on Twitter. Ecologist and conservationist Pete Cooper, who works for Gow, was already breeding glowworms with a method he perfected during the pandemic, assisted by YouTube tutorials from a glowworm keeper in Germany. Glowworm larvae are kept on a bed of coconut fibre in plastic takeaway tubs with a damp sponge to retain moisture, and fed fresh snails – also bred for the purpose – every day during their growing season. Cooper has even taken the glowworms with him in a cool-bag when travelling for work, so he can keep an eye on them and satisfy their voracious appetite for snails. The gardener at Elvetham has been collecting snails and leaving them in the release-zone for the 569 larvae that will be released last summer. These larvae will reach maturity and glow next summer. The hotel also has a timed lighting system to avoid disturbing the glowing females. The conservationists want glowworms to be emissaries for the restoration of “ordinary” local nature, so that churchyards, playing fields and local meadows become wildlife-rich places once again. Reviving glowworms will help other species. “These insects are driving habitat restoration which benefits a multitude of other species who love that messy mix. Where you get glowworms, you get slowworms, and reducing artificial lighting will help bats as well,” said Cooper. At Combeshead, Cooper believes the bare ground created by the rootling of the farm’s iron age pigs – similar to wild boar – will be particularly attractive to females because their lights can be more easily spotted by males if they glow on such terrain. Both Gow and Cooper hope that, if successful on these two sites, glowworm reintroduction can become more widespread, with community keepers and conservation groups forming a citizen-led restoration of the species. Gow said: “There is a powerful symbolism in the glowworm lights going out at a time when, ecologically, things are looking pretty grim, so we think this is something that could become a wider movement. “If we get really good at captive breeding and release, schoolchildren can turn these things out into the countryside. Why couldn’t this be something you do as a child that has real meaning? They will look at these tiny things they’ve allowed to twinkle again and say ‘we did that’. People need to have these formative experiences if they are to care for the things with whom we share the planet.” “What is life? It is the flash of a firefly in the night.”Crowfoot, a 19th-century chief of the Siksika First Nation. “We are all worms. But I believe that I am a glow-worm.”Winston Churchill, in a note to a friend. “The glow-worm shows the matin to be near/ And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.”The Ghost in Shakespeare’s Hamlet. “And for night tapers crop their waxen thighs / And light them at the fiery glow-worms’ eyes / To have my love to bed, and to arise.”Titania in A Midsummer Night’s Dream.",News/Environment,Glowworms bred in captivity to be released in southern England,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/20/glowworms-bred-in-captivity-to-be-released-in-southern-england
