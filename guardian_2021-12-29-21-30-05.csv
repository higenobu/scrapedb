12/29/2021,"Boris Johnson has urged people to get their booster vaccine as he said up to 90% of those in intensive care had not had their third Covid jabs. On a visit to a vaccine centre in Milton Keynes, the prime minister said people should enjoy their new year celebrations while taking extra precautions such as ventilation and testing, and he urged people to take up the offer of a third dose.  “I’m sorry to say this but the overwhelming majority of people who are currently ending up in intensive care in our hospitals are people who are not boosted,” he said. “I’ve talked to doctors who say the numbers are running up to 90% of people in intensive care.” He added: “If you’re not vaccinated, you’re eight times more likely to get into hospital altogether. So it’s a great thing to do. It’s very, very important. Get boosted for yourself, and enjoy new year sensibly and cautiously.” The NHS has called on people to have a “jabby new year”, highlighting research from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) that found that at the start of last month about three out of five patients in London’s intensive care units (ICU) had not received a jab, a figure that it said was rising. With new cases of Covid hitting 129,471 in England and Wales on Tuesday, the prime minister said Omicron continued to “cause real problems” even though it was “obviously milder than the Delta variant”. There were 18 new deaths within 28 days of a positive test in Tuesday’s figures. Johnson, who spent the Christmas break at Chequers with his family, suggested people should take tests before heading out for new year events, but the system has been dogged by shortages. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, said the situation was “a total shambles”. “People are trying to do the right thing, follow the government’s own advice and test themselves regularly, but are prevented by the Conservative government’s incompetence,” he said. “They need to get a grip and provide enough tests so people can keep themselves and everyone else safe.” Daisy Cooper, the Liberal Democrats health spokesperson, said it was “now or never to get Covid tests to frontline workers. If the government doesn’t get its act together today then vaccine centres could soon grind to a halt, and patient safety could be at risk from further NHS and care staff absences.” Almost 90% of the population aged 12 and over have received a first dose of a Covid vaccine but only 56.9% have had a booster. The government texted everyone urging them to “get boosted now” and highlighted available vaccine slots over the festive period. However, it has stopped short of bringing in vaccine passports in England, instead introducing Covid passes that give people the option of showing proof of vaccination or a recent lateral flow test to enter some large indoor venues.",News/Politics,"Up to 90% of Covid patients in ICU are unboosted, says Boris Johnson",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/29/up-90-covid-patients-icu-unboosted-boris-johnson

12/29/2021,"Four years ago, I caught the flu – and I am still stuck in bed, struggling to breathe. A bit like those with long Covid now, I developed postviral fatigue after a short illness. You could say I was into viruses before their mainstream second album. Born with a muscle weakness, I was already familiar with the fragility of the human body. But the overnight change, post‑flu complications, hit me like a truck. In the early days, stuck on a ventilator and barely able to move, my brain was so traumatised that I thought my bedroom curtains were on fire. I didn’t even have curtains.  Fatigue is hard to understand until you have it. It is not tiredness or burnout. It is all-consuming, an oppressive cocoon that weighs down your body. For me, an energetic day used to be getting the train to work and drinking with friends until 1am. Suddenly, it was cleaning the back of my teeth. When you are a child, you think doctors are meant to make it all better. When you become chronically ill, you realise you are lucky if you are believed, let alone treated. There is an odd privilege in having a “pre‑existing condition” before you get ill – a genetic disorder is hard to doubt – but it brings its own problems, not least the assumption that your disability is to blame. Finding a health professional who accepts and understands post-viral illness is akin to tracking down a unicorn with a medical degree. Ask someone with a chronic illness how they are and they will probably play down this reality. No one likes a moaner. Besides, when society thinks being disabled is a life of pitiable suffering, you don’t want to reinforce the prejudice. It is like how most of us are happy to make endless jokes about our home town, but see red the minute a stranger suggests the big Asda isn’t actually a social venue. The truth is, being ill every day is the hardest thing I have ever done – and I grew up in Grantham without becoming a Tory. It is not simply a case of coping with the symptoms, but also what they do to your life as you knew it – stealing nights out, careers and the ability to put on a bra with ease. This series is called “How I returned from rock bottom”, but the thing about chronic illness is, well, it is chronic. Yes, some people recover. But for most of us it is about learning to live long-term with a very different body – one that can get a bit better, then a lot worse, then whatever it feels like that month. I have not “overcome” anything, but I am happy and hopeful. I am also absolutely knackered. This is not the narrative society is used to. They don’t make Hallmark movies about someone never learning to walk again. But I think it is a much more important story. It is easy to be celebratory when you have made it to the top of the mountain; much harder when you are stuck halfway, freezing your arse off. Chronic illness is sometimes described as a form of grief, as if you are grieving for your former life. I prefer to think of it as beginning the next stage. Sure, things are not like they were. You are probably a lot more horizontal. But life does not tend to stay the same for long. The pandemic has taught us that. It is not healthy – no pun intended – to force yourself to be OK. It is completely normal to miss how things used to be. There are days I want to be in the pub with friends so much that the only thing to do is cry. So, cry. Have a snotty sobfest. But you will smile in the end, too. Lots. Not because the pain has stopped, but because, eventually, you will realise that the pain won’t stop you being you. It is easy to chastise your body for “failing”, but I try to feel pride in its victories. Mine copes with more most days than other young people’s do in a decade. I reward it accordingly, usually with codeine wrapped in a chocolate roll. I am also teaching myself to stand up to medics, when necessary, and turn to the online chronic illness community for advice. I find the things I can do and I squeeze the joy out of them – every drop. Maybe all of this sounds familiar. Maybe your own curtains have just caught fire. I am not going to patronise you by saying this can be easy, but I would wager that it will not beat you, either. The human capacity for resilience and renewal is greater than most of us imagine. Once you have survived illness, living – and living well – comes step by step.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Fatigue is an oppressive cocoon. It has made me seek joy wherever I can,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/29/fatigue-is-an-oppressive-cocoon-it-has-made-me-seek-joy-wherever-i-can
12/29/2021,"Joe Root has been backed to remain as England’s Test captain by his employers as the inquest into their Ashes humiliation gets under way. The Guardian understands Tom Harrison, the chief executive of the England and Wales Cricket Board, met Root in Melbourne on Wednesday to discuss the reasons behind the failing tour but is said to be supportive of the 30-year-old staying on as captain despite a record nine defeats in 2021. Significant caveats remain as to Root’s continuation for England’s Test tour to the Caribbean in March, not least his own desire to balance the strains of leadership with his batting after nearly five years in the job and the potential damage that could yet be inflicted during the final two Tests in Sydney and Hobart.  Even less certain is the future of Chris Silverwood, the head coach and selector, plus his backroom staff during a series England trail three-nil. Whether Root remains as captain or not, a number of roles may hinge on the feedback he passes on to Harrison and Ashley Giles, the director of men’s cricket who arrives in Sydney next week. Root said he would wait until the end of the series before making any decision. Although neither he nor Silverwood have covered themselves in glory over strategy, the apparent support for the former in part reflects a lack of credible captaincy alternatives who could be viewed as likely first-team regulars over the next year. Ben Stokes, Root’s vice-captain, is arguably the only other player who could claim to be in this position but there would be concerns about overburdening an all-rounder who has struggled for form during the series. It is also his first outing since taking a four-month break during the summer to address a finger injury and his mental health. The batting unit would usually present candidates but has disintegrated over the past 12 months. After Root’s 1,708 Test runs in 2021, the next highest run-scorer with 530 is Rory Burns who, though a title-winning captain at Surrey, was recently dropped for a second time. To sum things up, extras sit in third place with 412 runs. From the team that lost inside three days at the MCG, only the incumbent top three of Zak Crawley, Haseeb Hameed and Dawid Malan took up at an optional net session on Wednesday, along with the players who missed out on selection for the Third Test. Chris Woakes, dropped after the first two, was asked whether the team would endorse Root’s continuation and replied: “Absolutely. It’s clear that the captaincy isn’t having an effect on his batting, which a lot of the time with captains can be the case. “The fact that he’s scoring the runs he is is great for the team. It would be great if we could help him out with that and build some partnerships with him, and score a few more runs around him. But Joe is a great cricketer, he’s got a great cricket brain. “I think his record as England captain [59 Tests, 27 wins, 24 defeats, eight draws] is pretty good, as far as I’m aware. I definitely feel like Joe will continue.” Asked if Silverwood has the same backing, Woakes replied: “Who am I to talk about people’s futures other than my own, to be brutally honest? We have two more games and we want to show a lot of character, a lot of fight. “We want to put some pride back into wearing that badge, which we certainly have tried in this series, but we need to try even harder and put that right. The group of players, the management and the staff we have out here have the backing of the players to hopefully put things right, over the next two games in particular.” Internal support for Root should be couched by the fact that a number of Test careers are potentially on the line in the coming weeks, as well as uncertainty over Harrison’s own continuation at the ECB once the governing body’s £2.1m long-term incentive plan for its executive team matures at the end of the financial year. There is also no permanent ECB chair at present, with Barry O’Brien only interim, and any new leadership team will likely have their own ideas about roles such as those held by Giles – the director of men’s cricket technically hires the head coach and captain – and the performance director, Mo Bobat, who oversees long-term strategy. The latter was in charge of the Lions team that played a tour match against Australia A during the first Test in Brisbane yet selected only off-spinner Dom Bess from the unused players in the senior Test squad. Crawley, who made scores of 12 and five on his return to the Test team in Melbourne, might have benefited from playing.",Sport/Sport,Joe Root backed to remain as England Test captain despite Ashes failure,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/29/joe-root-backed-to-remain-as-england-test-cricket-captain-despite-ashes-failure
12/29/2021,"On 1 December, a United Airlines passenger plane flew from Chicago to Washington powered solely by fuel made from cooking oils, agricultural waste and other materials rather than fossil fuels.  Billed by the airline as the world’s first fully-loaded passenger flight to run on 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), it was United’s latest attempt to demonstrate its climate credentials. United’s CEO Scott Kirby called it “a significant milestone” for efforts to decarbonize the industry. But to critics, it was another attempt to make sustainable aviation seem a lot closer than it is in reality and give the impression people can fly guilt-free. The global supply of SAF remains very limited and there are big obstacles to scaling it up. Yet despite these challenges, United Airlines is pursuing a growth strategy which includes increasing flight numbers, adding new routes and investing in supersonic aviation. When Covid restrictions ease again and the world opens back up, airlines including United are hoping to see rapid recovery. In the US, the industry is already expecting pre-pandemic levels of travellers this holiday season despite the rise of the Omicron variant. At the same time, it is under increasing pressure to tackle its climate footprint. Aviation makes up about 2.5% of global emissions but the UN has projected that carbon emissions could triple by 2050. While airlines have been slow to make net zero commitments – the industry is heavily reliant on fossil fuels, and technologies to decarbonize flying are a long way from scaling – some are starting to come out with pledges. United has sought to position itself at the front of the industry’s efforts. In 2020, the airline promised to become “100% green” by 2050 – a commitment to reach net zero without using carbon offsets, which are widely used by the rest of the industry. Kirby, who has called climate change “the biggest issue facing our generation” has criticized offsets as a “fig leaf”. Instead, “we’re taking our dollars, our time and our commitment and really focusing all of it on those solutions that can actually pull the emissions out of flying,” said Lauren Riley, managing director for global environmental affairs and sustainability at United. The airline is making big investments in sustainable aviation fuels, including an investment in Fulcrum Bioenergy, a company that makes jet fuel from household garbage. SAFs can reduce emissions by 80% on a lifecycle basis compared with conventional fuel, according to aviation industry body IATA. United is also funding projects that suck carbon directly from the air. “Direct air capture is going to play a massive role,” said Riley. United is planning to invest in the project 1PointFive, said Riley, which is building a direct air capture plant in Texas. “One of these plants will remove as much CO2 as 40m trees,” she said. But the challenges to scaling up these technologies are immense. Direct air capture is not yet operating at anything like the scale required. There are only 19 DAC plants in operation globally, which collectively remove about 100,000 tons of CO2 annually – a long way from the 85m tons a year the IEA estimates must be removed by 2030 as part of measures to keep to 1.5C of warming. And when it comes to sustainable fuels, supplies remain limited. Globally SAF still makes up less than 0.1% of aviation fuel and it costs about three to four times more than conventional fuel. Riley readily acknowledged that United currently uses tiny amounts of SAF. The airline burns about 4bn gallons of fuel in a typical pre-pandemic year, only 1m gallons of which is SAF. “And we have the most supply so that’s just bananas,” Riley said. A big challenge to scaling up SAF is finding the right feedstocks, ones which don’t themselves cause environmental damage. For bio-based fuels, using cooking oils and agricultural waste, can keep the waste from landfill or being left to rot, but this source has limited availability. Growing crops to produce fuel can bring problems of land clearing, deforestation, agricultural pollution and could compete with food production. And while sources for synthetic fuels – made by combining hydrogen produced by renewable energy and recycled carbon – are technically abundant, the process remains very expensive and will require huge amounts of clean energy. Airlines have been talking about SAFs since at least 2009, said Dan Rutherford, who directs the International Council on Clean Transportation’s aviation and marine programs. “The history actually is very clear that these things aren’t scaling.” While SAF mandates are being considered by governments including the US and the EU, he said take-up “is not going to be as fast as the airlines think it is”. Yet United’s strategy involves scaling up flying. It has increased the number of daily flights to London and in October it announced several new routes, including flights to Amman, Jordan, and Tenerife in the Canary Islands. Perhaps the airline’s biggest move – and to some experts, the most surprising – is its leap into supersonic travel. In June, United announced a deal with Denver-based company Boom Supersonic, agreeing to spend an estimated $3bn on 15 Overtures – Boom’s supersonic passenger jets. Both companies say supersonic flight fits in with net zero commitments. The supersonic jets are “designed to run on 100% SAF”, said Riley. They will be “net zero carbon”, said a spokesperson for Boom Supersonic, who added “we’re highly optimistic about SAF supply by 2029, when Overture is slated to carry passengers”. But despite this confidence, there are questions about where this fuel will come from and what it would mean for decarbonizing the rest of the industry. Supersonic jets can burn five to seven times more fuel than traditional aircraft. Boom said it was too early to give numbers on how much SAF the Overtures would use but said that fuel efficiency is “a top priority”. “What we do have to recognise here,” Riley said, “is that innovation is going to continue but also core to that is that we’re committed to all of these innovations, doing them sustainably.” Experts remain very skeptical. “Putting these fuels into supersonic jets … would be an insane use of scarce resource,” said Cait Hewitt, policy director of the UK non-profit the Aviation Environment Federation. Rutherford said United’s bet on supersonics “is just completely baffling to me – why you would take pretty pro-climate commitments on one hand [and] on the other hand sign on to an aircraft that we know is going to be at least five times as carbon intensive as subsonic aircraft.” According to his calculations, United’s 1m gallons of SAF a year would operate 15 supersonic jets for two days. For some experts, reducing flying is the only genuine path to achieving net zero, especially as emissions from industry growth pre-pandemic outpaced those saved by efficiency measures and other climate policies. The “flight shame” movement has become more mainstream over the last few years, making frequent flying less socially acceptable. One airline even tried making flying less part of its marketing strategy. In 2019, KLM ran a campaign encouraging people to consider taking a train or having a video call instead of flying. When asked if flying less would ever be part of United’s vision for flying sustainable, Riley said “I like to look at it as flying sustainably so it’s not an either or; it’s getting on an aeroplane that’s fully fueled by sustainable aviation fuel and perhaps it’s a zero-carbon flight. That’s what we’re working towards.” But Hewitt dismisses the idea of delivering zero emissions commercial flight any time soon. “Given how far we are from knowing how to decarbonize flying, we really need to be downsizing aviation demand,” she said.",News/Environment,United Airlines promises sustainable flying – but experts aren’t convinced,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/29/united-airlines-sustainable-green-flying-experts
12/29/2021,"Queues at food banks, schools charging parents’ mobile phones, and plumbers fixing boilers for nothing so pensioners don’t freeze have become a routine part of life in the UK: the result of more than a decade of crippling austerity and a pandemic that hit the lowest paid the hardest. On the Guardian’s video team, where I’m a producer, we’ve spent a year speaking to individuals who have gone far beyond the extra mile to support their communities, to fill the gaps where state support is lacking. We rightly celebrate these people as inspirational, but rarely do we question what burden this puts on them.  Deep into the winter lockdown we met Pastor Mick Fleming. He was called to officiate at Covid funerals people couldn’t afford, to stock bare cupboards, and to be on the end of the phone when they were feeling suicidal. He ran his ministry – known as the Church on the Street – from his van and his mobile phone. Deep structural inequalities, including deprivation, a high incidence of chronic illness and insecure work left towns such as Burnley particularly vulnerable to the pandemic, and the former drug dealer-turned-vicar explained that for a lot of people the pandemic was one more problem on an already long list. He has since moved in to an old gym just off the high street, where he sees up to 1,000 people a week, paid for by a crowdfunder because people were so moved by Mick’s media appearances. It has been a big year for Mick, but he has also made some significant sacrifices: not least living in a separate house from his wife. This is partly because she was having cancer treatment and he didn’t want to bring Covid home when she was vulnerable. Also, the magnitude of what they deal with – his wife also works for Church on the Street – means that they need their own space to process everything. Mick is frequently confronted with his past experiences of child abuse and drug taking as he fields requests for help. He has no formal training to deal with these often difficult conversations, but uses the basic principle of compassion, inspired by his own recovery. He cries a lot and encourages his volunteers to do the same. In Glasgow we met Peter Krykant, the man behind the UK’s first “drug consumption van”. He would drive to the city centre four times a week in his converted ambulance stocked with needles, naloxone supplies and clean water. Within minutes people would turn up to make the most of a warm, dry and sterile environment where they could inject. Peter and his team of volunteers would supervise every injection, and were always on hand if anyone wanted to chat. Many of the van users we spoke to had experienced deep personal trauma that had contributed to their drug use. Scotland has the highest drug mortality in Europe, with deaths disproportionately represented in the most deprived areas, and while the Scottish government has shown interest in the potential use of overdose prevention centres, Peter’s van has been the only attempt at such a facility to date – and it was never formally sanctioned. He relied on crowdfunding to support what he was doing and because he lost his job when he started the van project, he estimates he has racked up debts of about £10,000. Peter risked arrest as a result of running the service, but the biggest consequence has been the impact of witnessing so much trauma. The nature of his approach meant that he could not access professional psychological support, and after being clean for 11 years Peter started taking drugs again. He told me he was in so much “pain emotionally”. He might have been providing respite for some people, but it wasn’t sustainable for one man to shoulder the entire burden. Six months on, Peter believes that Scotland is now edging towards an official injection site, and that the hours he has put into the van have contributed to that. He now has a job with a substance misuse charity, but the van regulars are always on his mind. He thinks about what they are doing now “in the winter, injecting in alleyways”, and “feels guilty” that he can no longer be there for them. We visited Blackpool in November, where the cuts to universal credit were taking their toll. One man tearfully told us that he now has to choose between feeding himself and his dog. He is one of hundreds who visit the Amazing Graze soup kitchen on a cold Friday night for a hot meal and a bag of groceries to help get him through the week. It’s run by Mark and Abbie Butcher, a couple who provide so much more than meals. They ring round hotels to find beds for homeless people, plead with charities to get others into detox programmes and provide pastoral care and housing for their chefs – many of whom were themselves once homeless. It has become such a part of their lives that they’ve had to promise their children they won’t invite anyone extra to Christmas dinner this year (they will make a Christmas dinner at the soup kitchen before the big day instead). Amazing Graze doesn’t get council grants but funds most of what it does with the profits from a pizza restaurant, and also has crowdfunding boosted by its media appearances. Yet it’s still a scramble for donations. As the queue grows outside, volunteer Sue explains that the hardest thing is when they don’t have much to give, and tonight it’s just fruit and bread. She had put out a call for more food on Facebook but got nothing. “Maybe everyone is struggling now.” She later admitted to spending £25 a week of her own money on pet food so other people’s pets didn’t go hungry. There have been others too. In Newham, east London, which has the highest number of children living in poverty in the city, we met ex-offender Raheel Butt who sold his house to set up a gym to try to steer young people away from gang violence. And Nicole Bello, who drove from Kent into the borough every day to run a summer school for the children of parents who needed to go to work in the holidays. She knew the parents needed help because she met them at the food bank she had set up in the pandemic. These volunteers, and so many others we met, are providing a vital service. Someone to speak to in person, not at the end of a phone line. A hot meal in the warm. Someone who will offer support where others might call the police. They are the bedrock of our communities, and exactly what Mick believes will help heal “the deep social scars inflicted by the pandemic”. But he’d like to see opportunities for projects such as his, driven by a desire to help others, to be able to bid for funding. When we clapped for health workers during the pandemic, they said thank you but also asked for a pay rise. It’s now time to think about how the initiatives that we celebrate can be nourished and sustained. No one should be left strung out, broke or worse off because they wanted to make their community better.",Opinion/Opinion,Helping the helpers: it’s time to support those who hold Britain's communities together | Maeve Shearlaw,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/29/helping-helpers-britain-communities-vulnerable-people-guardian-video
12/29/2021,"Raheem Sterling has hailed Gareth Southgate for transforming the culture and atmosphere within the England squad but insisted their journey won’t be complete unless it ends with a major tournament victory. Speaking as part of his appearance as guest editor on Radio 4’s Today programme, Sterling admitted that the players had felt “scarred” by their performances at Euro 2016, where they were defeated by the last 16 by Iceland, and felt a huge weight on their shoulders until Southgate helped the team come together.  England have since finished fourth at the 2018 World Cup and the final of Euro 2020 earlier this year. However Sterling says he was left unsatisfied by the penalty defeat to Italy at the Euros, despite it being England’s best performance in a major tournament for 55 years. “Everyone after the tournament was congratulating me. Congratulating me for what?” he said. “That is not what the team set out to do. Yes, it was a great journey. But at the same time we want to have our hands on a trophy. Because there is nothing more important or bigger than winning a major tournament with England.” England will head to Qatar next year among the favourites to win the 2022 World Cup, and Sterling is confident the team can go all the way. “I think we have players at the right ages, challenging for the right things and have the mentality to be the best in their position,” he added. Sterling also credited Southgate for changing the mood in the squad after he took over following the departure of Sam Allardyce in 2016. “From when I first came into the squad to now you can see with conversations with the boys how enjoyable it is just to come,” said Sterling. “Everyone can’t wait. We are speaking on texts nowadays and I don’t think it was quite that way in previous years. Players felt a huge weight on their shoulders. “The belief wasn’t there within the team after Euro 2016. But when Gareth came in, he really tried to make us understand that yes, that’s what the scarring is, but how are we going to change it? The team has grown as one. We want to do things as a collective.” Southgate said the decision to take a knee before games to highlight racial injustice – despite sharp criticism from the prime minister Boris Johnson and home secretary Priti Patel – had helped build unity within the England squad during Euro 2020. But he said that coming together on racism had begun two years earlier after Danny Rose and Sterling suffered abuse in Montenegro in March 2019. “This decision we took last year from a team perspective really started in Montenegro when Raheem and Danny suffered abuse,” he said. “I wasn’t aware of it until very close to the end when Danny got booked and there was a reaction from the crowd. So when we got to the changing room I am having a go at Danny for being booked, and I had to apologise on the plane because it suddenly emerged that this had been going on during the game. “I didn’t like the fact that the boys felt they couldn’t mention it in the changing room at half time or report it,” added Southgate. “For me, it was like: ‘God this is awful. How is this an environment where our players are allowed to be abused on the pitch and they don’t even feel comfortable to report it or that anything is going to happen?’ “This had to be a team where we were united in how we saw it and we could send a message to young kids watching. I think the lads didn’t think how powerful that would be and they wanted to be judged on the football.

12/29/2021,"An MP has called for a change in the law after an abusive husband inherited his wife’s estate despite an inquest linking her suicide to domestic violence. Florence Eshalomi, the Labour MP for Vauxhall in south London, said there was a clear “hole in the law” when the husband, who was also convicted of attacking her, could benefit.  The case was raised with Eshalomi by the woman’s son, one of her constituents, who discovered his mother on the day after she killed herself. The 29-year-old, who asked that neither he nor his family members be named, said: “You would think that if one court finds you guilty of domestic violence and another court links your violence to a death, there might be some consequences. Not for my stepdad… he is set to inherit close to £1m. “Putting aside the fact that he contributed nothing to their marriage – my mum owned her house outright before meeting him and earned her pension and savings through years in the NHS – how can it be right that her abuser benefits financially at all? “I can’t put into words how angry I am. Not only has he taken my mum from my brother and me but he has insulted her memory by trampling all over her very clearly documented wishes.” His mother, a GP, married her second husband in July 2012. In August 2019, while on holiday in France, he attacked her, punching her in the head and pressing his thumbs into her cheekbones. She left him afterwards, taking out a non-molestation order and occupation order, prohibiting contact. But having previously had severe depression, she had a relapse, as well as panic attacks, and in June last year, aged 56, she killed herself. At an inquest in November last year, the senior coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox concluded: “She took her own life while suffering anxiety precipitated by a domestic violence incident.” The woman’s husband was originally due to stand trial in France for domestic violence in March last year but was eventually convicted a year later after it was delayed because of Covid. His estranged wife rewrote her will, leaving everything to her sons but it was deemed invalid, because it was only witnessed by one person. Eshalomi, who, with her constituent, is meeting Boris Johnson next month to discuss the issue, said in relying on victims to disinherit an abusive partner, the law failed to recognise the severe mental health impacts domestic abuse could have. She said: “There is already precedent for this in murder cases, where the ‘forfeiture rule’ prevents killers from inheriting from those they murder by default. “An extension of this to cases of abuse where this is found to be a contributing factor in the victim’s death would close the loophole that my constituent and his family have fallen foul of. We must ensure this is never allowed to happen to anybody else.” She said since raising it at prime minister’s questions she had been contacted by several others who had been similarly affected. Her constituent said: “If you are violent to your partner you have broken the terms of your marriage. As a result, all legal benefits of marriage should be automatically revoked, and that includes the right to inherit.”  In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 and the domestic violence helpline is on 0808 2000 247. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14 and the national family violence counselling service is on 1800 737 732. In the US, the suicide prevention lifeline is 1-800-273-8255 and the domestic Violence hotline is 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).

12/29/2021,"On the brink of a new year, the world faces a daunting array of challenges: the resurgent Covid-19 pandemic, the climate emergency, the struggle between democracy and authoritarianism, humanitarian crises, mass migration, and trans-national terrorism. There is the risk of new inter-state conflicts, exacerbated by the breakdown of the rules-based international order, and the spread of lethal autonomous weapons. All in all, for most people on Earth – and a handful in space – 2022 will be another year of living dangerously.  Events in the Middle East will make global headlines again in 2022 – but for positive as well as negative reasons. A cause for optimism is football’s World Cup, which kicks off in Qatar in November. It’s the first time an Arab or a Muslim country has hosted the tournament. It is expected to provide a major fillip for the Gulf region in terms of future business and tourism – and, possibly, more open, progressive forms of governance. But the choice of Qatar, overshadowed by allegations of corruption, was controversial from the start. Its human rights record will come under increased scrutiny. Its treatment of low-paid migrant workers is another flashpoint. The Guardian revealed that at least 6,500 workers have died since Qatar got the nod from Fifa in 2010, killed while building seven new stadiums, roads and hotels, and a new airport. Concerns will also persist about Qatar’s illiberal attitude to free speech and women’s and LGBTQ+ rights in a country where it remains dangerous to openly criticise the government and where homosexuality is illegal. But analysts suggest most fans will not focus on these issues, which could make Qatar 2022 the most successful example of “sports-washing” to date. More familiar subjects will otherwise dominate the regional agenda. Foremost is the question of whether Israel and/or the US will take new military and/or economic steps to curb Iran’s attempts, which Tehran denies, to acquire capability to build nuclear weapons. Israel has been threatening air strikes if slow-moving talks to revive the 2015 nuclear deal fail. Even football fans could not ignore a war in the Gulf. Attention will focus on Turkey’s authoritarian president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, whose neo-Islamist AKP party will mark 20 years in power in 2022. Erdoğan’s rule has grown increasingly oppressive at home, while his aggressive foreign policy, rows with the EU and US, on-off collusion with Russia over Syria and chronic economic mismanagement could have unpredictable consequences. Other hotspots are likely to be Lebanon – tottering on the verge of becoming a failed state like war-torn Yemen – and ever-chaotic Libya. Close attention should also be paid to Palestine, where the unpopular president, Mahmoud Abbas’s postponement of elections, Israeli settler violence and West Bank land-grabs, and the lack of an active peace process all loom large. The eyes of the world will be on China at the beginning and the end of the year, and quite possibly in the intervening period as well. The Winter Olympics open in Beijing in February. But the crucial question, for sports fans, of who tops the medals table may be overshadowed by diplomatic boycotts by the US, UK and other countries in protest at China’s serial human rights abuses. They fear the Games may become a Chinese Communist party propaganda exercise. The CCP’s 20th national congress, due towards the end of the year, will be the other headline-grabber. President Xi Jinping is hoping to secure an unprecedented third five-year term, which, if achieved, would confirm his position as China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. There will also be jostling for senior positions in the Politburo and Politburo standing committee. It will not necessarily all go Xi’s way. Western analysts differ sharply over how secure Xi’s position truly is. A slowing economy, a debt crisis, an ageing population, huge environmental and climate-related challenges, and US-led attempts to “contain” China by signing up neighbouring countries are all putting pressure on Xi. Yet, as matters stand, 2022 is likely to see ongoing, bullish attempts to expand China’s global economic and geopolitical influence. A military attack on Taiwan, which Xi has vowed to re-conquer by any or all means, could change everything. India, China’s biggest regional competitor, may continue to punch below its weight on the world stage. In what could be a symbolically important moment, its total population could soon match or exceed China’s 1.41 billion, according to some estimates. Yet at the same time, Indian birth rates and average family sizes are falling. Not so symbolic, and more dangerous, are unresolved Himalayan border disputes between these two giant neighbours, which led to violence in 2020-21 and reflect a broader deterioration in bilateral relations. The popularity of Narendra Modi, India’s authoritarian prime minister, has taken a dive of late, due to the pandemic and a sluggish economy. He was forced into an embarrassing U-turn on farm “reform” and is accused of using terrorism laws to silence critics. His BJP party will try to regain lost ground in a string of state elections in 2022. Modi’s policy of stronger ties with the west, exemplified by the Quad alliance (India, the US, Japan, Australia), will likely be reinforced, adding to China’s discomfort. Elsewhere in Asia, violent repression in Myanmar and the desperate plight of the Afghan people following the Taliban takeover will likely provoke more western hand-wringing than concrete action. Afghanistan totters on the brink of disaster. “We’re looking at 23 million people marching towards starvation,” says David Beasley of the World Food Programme. “The next six months are going to be catastrophic.” North Korea’s nuclear brinkmanship may bring a showdown as Kim Jong-un’s paranoid regime sends mixed signals about war and peace. The Philippines will elect a new president; the foul-mouthed incumbent, Rodrigo Duterte, is limited to a single term. Unfortunately this is not the case with Scott Morrison, who will seek re-election as Australia’s prime minister. It will be a critical year for Europe as the EU and national leaders grapple with tense internal and external divisions, the social and economic impact of the unending pandemic, migration and the newly reinforced challenges, post-Cop26, posed by net zero emissions targets. More fundamentally, Europe must decide whether it wants to be taken seriously as a global actor, or will surrender its international influence to China, the US and malign regimes such as Vladimir Putin’s Russia. The tone may be set by spring elections in France and Hungary, where rightwing populist forces are again pushing divisive agendas. Viktor Orbán, the authoritarian Hungarian leader who has made a mockery of the EU over rule of law, democracy and free speech issues, will face a united opposition for the first time. His fate will be watched closely in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and other EU member states where reactionary far-right parties flourish. Emmanuel Macron, the neo-Gaullist centrist who came from nowhere in 2017, will ask French voters for a second term in preference to his avowedly racist, Islamophobic rivals, Marine Le Pen and Éric Zemmour. Polls put him ahead, although he also faces what could be a strong challenge from the centre-right Republicans, whose candidate, Valérie Pécresse, is the first woman to lead the conservatives. With the left in disarray, the election could radicalise France in reactionary ways. Elections are also due in Sweden, Serbia and Austria. Germany’s new SPD-led coalition government will come under close scrutiny as it attempts to do things differently after the long years of Angela Merkel’s reign. Despite some conciliatory pledges, friction will be hard to avoid with the European Commission, led by Merkel ally Ursula von der Leyen, and with France and other southern EU members over budgetary policy and debt. France assumes the EU presidency in January and Macron will try to advance his ideas about common defence and security policy – what he calls “strategic autonomy”. Macron’s belief that Europe must stand up for itself in a hostile world will be put to the test on a range of fronts, notably Ukraine. Analysts suggest rising Russian military pressure, including a large border troop build-up and a threat to deploy nuclear missiles, could lead to renewed conflict early in the year as Nato hangs back. Other trigger issues include Belarus’s weaponising of migration (and the continuing absence of a humane pan-European migration policy) and brewing separatist trouble in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Balkans. The EU is planning a China summit, but there is no consensus over how to balance business and human rights. In isolated, increasingly impoverished Britain, Brexit buyers’ remorse looks certain to intensify. Relations with the US, which takes a dim view of European autonomy but appears ambivalent over Ukraine, may prove tense at times. Nato, its credibility damaged post-Afghanistan, faces a difficult year as it seeks a new secretary-general. Smart money says a woman could get the top job for the first time. The former UK prime minister Theresa May has been mentioned – but the French will not want a Brit. The struggle to defeat Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s notorious rightwing president, in national elections due in October looks set to produce an epic battle with international ramifications. Inside Brazil, Bolsonaro has been widely condemned for his lethally negligent handling of the Covid pandemic. Over half a million Brazilians have died, more than in any country bar the US. Beyond Brazil, Bolsonaro is reviled for his climate change denial and the accelerated destruction of the Amazon rainforest. Opinion polls show that, should he stand, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the former president who was jailed and then cleared on corruption charges, would easily beat Bolsonaro. But that assumes a fair fight. Concern is growing that American supporters of Donald Trump are coaching the Bolsonaro camp on how to steal an election or mount a coup to overturn the result, as Trump tried and failed to do in Washington a year ago. Fears grow that Trump-style electoral subversion may find more emulators around the world. Surveys in Europe suggest support for rightwing populist-nationalist politicians is waning, but that may not be the case in South America, outside Brazil, and other parts of the developing world in 2022. Populism feeds off the gap between corrupt “elites” and so-called “ordinary people”, and in many poorer countries, that gap, measured in wealth and power, is growing. In Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela, supposed champions of the people have become their oppressors, and this phenomenon looks set to continue. In Chile, the presidential election’s first round produced strong support for José Antonio Kast, a hard-right Pinochet apologist, though he was ultimately defeated by Gabriel Boric, a leftist former student leader, who will become the country’s youngest leader after storming to a resounding victory in a run-off. Argentina’s president, Alberto Fernández, faces a different kind of problem in what looks like a tough year ahead, after elections in which his Peronists, one of the world’s oldest populist parties, lost their majority in Congress for the first time in nearly 40 years. Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, will face ongoing tensions with the US over trade, drugs and migration from Central America. But at least he no longer has to put up with Trump’s insults – for now. All eyes will be on the campaign for November’s mid-term elections when the Democrats will attempt to fend off a Republican bid to re-take control of the Senate and House of Representatives. The results will inevitably be viewed as a referendum on Joe Biden’s presidency. If the GOP does well in the battleground states, Donald Trump – who still falsely claims to have won the 2020 election – will almost certainly decide to run for a second term in 2024. Certain issues will have nationwide resonance: in particular, progress (or otherwise) in stemming the pandemic and ongoing anti-vax resistance; the economy, with prices and interest rates set to rise; and divisive social issues such as migration, race and abortion rights, with the supreme court predicted to overrule or seriously weaken provisions of the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade decision. The Democrats’ biggest problem in 2022 may be internal party divisions. The split between so-called progressives and moderates, especially in the Senate, undermined Biden’s signature social care and infrastructure spending bills, which were watered down. Some of the focus will be on Biden himself: whether he will run again in 2024, his age (he will be 80 in November), his mental agility and his ability to deliver his agenda. His mid-December minus-7 approval rating may prove hard to turn around. Also under the microscope is Kamala Harris, the vice-president, who is said to be unsettled and under-performing – at least by those with an interest is destabilising the White House. Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary who sought the Democratic nomination in 2020, is a man to watch, as a possible replacement for Harris or even for Biden, should the president settle for one term. Concern has grown, meanwhile, over whether the mid-terms will be free and fair, given extraordinary efforts by Republican state legislators to make it harder to vote and even harder for opponents to win gerrymandered congressional districts and precincts with in-built GOP majorities. One survey estimates Republicans will flip at least five House seats thanks to redrawn, absurdly distorted voting maps. This could be enough to assure a Republican House majority before voting even begins. Pressure from would-be Central American migrants on the southern US border will likely be a running story in 2022 – a problem Harris, who was tasked with dealing with it, has fumbled so far. She and Biden are accused of continuing Trump’s harsh policies. Belief in Biden’s competence has also been undermined by the chaotic Afghan withdrawal, which felt to many like a Vietnam-scale humiliation. Another big foreign policy setback or overseas conflagration – such as a Russian land-grab in Ukraine, direct Chinese aggression against Taiwan or an Israel-Iran conflict – has potential to suck in US forces and wreck Biden’s presidency. In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to push new policy initiatives on affordable childcare and housing after winning re-election in September. But in 2021’s snap election his Liberals attracted the smallest share of the popular vote of any winning party in history, suggesting the Trudeau magic is wearing thin. Disputes swirl over alleged corruption, pandemic management, trade with the US and carbon reduction policy. As befits this giant continent, some of 2022’s biggest themes will play out across Africa. Among the most striking is the fraught question of whether Africans, still largely unvaccinated, will pay a huge, avoidable price for the developed world’s monopolising of vaccines, its reluctance to distribute surpluses and share patents – and from the pandemic’s myriad, knock-on health and economic impacts. This question in turn raises another: will such selfishness rebound on the wealthy north, as former UK prime minister Gordon Brown has repeatedly warned? The sudden spread of Omicron, first identified in South Africa, suggests more Covid variants could emerge in 2022. Yet once again, the response of developed countries may be to focus on domestic protection, not international cooperation. The course of the global pandemic in 2022 – both in terms of the threat to health and economic prosperity – is ultimately unknowable. But in many African countries, with relatively young populations less vulnerable to severe Covid harms, the bigger problem may be the negative impact on management of other diseases. It’s estimated 25 million people in Africa will live with HIV-Aids in 2022. Malaria claims almost 400,000 lives in a typical year. Treatment of these diseases, and others such as TB and diabetes, may deteriorate further as a result of Covid-related strains on healthcare systems. Replacing the Middle East, Africa has become the new ground zero for international terrorism, at least in the view of many analysts. This trend looks set to continue in 2022. The countries of the Sahel, in particular, have seen an upsurge of radical Islamist groups, mostly home-grown, yet often professing allegiance to global networks such as al-Qaida and Islamic State. Western efforts to counter this upsurge in jihadist violence may become more organised in 2022. This follows a cooperation agreement between the US and French presidents Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron, who had wound down French military operations in Mali for lack of support. Western governments are watching with alarm the spread of radical Islamist ideas from key countries in west Africa, such as Nigeria, to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and energy-rich Mozambique. The failed state of Somalia, where the al-Shabaab group is active, is a cautionary tale of what may befall a country when terrorism is uncontained. In a year when the US is due to convene a second “summit for democracy”, the issue of global democratic governance – of the lack of it – will also loom large. In Africa, which experienced several coups in 2021, most recently in Sudan, this issue is especially pressing. Inextricably linked to it are the challenges posed by extreme poverty. According to the International Rescue Committee charity’s 2022 emergency watchlist, 12 of the 20 countries at greatest risk of worsening humanitarian crises are in Africa. They are Ethiopia, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Sudan, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Mozambique, Mali, Niger and Cameroon. (The most vulnerable, non-African countries are Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, Myanmar, Haiti, Honduras, Lebanon and Venezuela.) In the Horn of Africa, what the IRC calls Ethiopia’s “perfect storm” of problems is being exacerbated by a worsening civil war that threatens the break-up of the country amid increased meddling by neighbouring Eritrea’s violently Stalinist regime. Meanwhile, the UN is warning a rapidly worsening drought will put 7.7 million Somalis at extreme risk by April. Unicef, the UN children’s charity, has launched a record $9.4bn worldwide funding appeal for 2022 to help more than 327 million people, including 177 million children, affected by humanitarian crises and Covid. These emergencies provide the context for another great challenge of 2022: international migration, whether it involves refugees from conflict, politically persecuted asylum-seekers, or economic migrants forced out of their homes by climate change, famine and drought. The UN’s International Organisation for Migration says a record 281 million people, or 3.6% of the global population, were classified as international migrants in 2020. This figure is climbing despite pandemic restrictions on movement across international borders. These extraordinary population shifts have yet to produce a coordinated, or even rational, response from most governments, notably in wealthy North America and Europe. Maybe this will change in 2022. But don’t hold your breath. Cop27, the follow-up to the Cop26 Glasgow climate crisis conference, will be held in Egypt in November. It will provide progress reports on the Glasgow pledges to reduce carbon and methane emissions, halt deforestation, “phase down” coal production, cut fossil fuel subsidies and provide finance to mitigate the loss and damage suffered by poorer countries. It’s unrealistic to expect any swift improvement in the global climate heating outlook in the coming year. Extreme weather events of the type seen across the world in 2021 – fires, droughts, floods, storms and record temperatures – are almost certain to be repeated. As before, these effects will be particularly felt in the world’s more sensitive environments, not least the Antarctic and Arctic. Both polar regions will see increased human activity in 2022 – not necessarily a happy prospect. In Antarctica, for example, mass tourism is taking off with the advent of ice runways accommodating wide-bodied jets. More problematic still is the growing interest of China, with other countries, in tapping into Antarctic’s resources and establishing military facilities there. Likewise the melting ice of the Arctic has opened up commercial and naval sea-lanes across the top of the world, currently being developed by Russia in heated competition with several other countries. Long neglected Greenland is a new El Dorado for mineral and mining companies, and also of growing interest to defence planners – but local people’s resistance to issuing licences is growing. It will be a busy year in space in terms of exploration and military competition. Nasa is preparing 18 separate missions in 2022 as it gears up to resume manned flight to the moon. A new space station – Gateway – is planned. Russia, South Korea, India and Japan will launch lunar spacecraft. The European Space Agency plans to send a mission to Mars. China is said to be hoping to have a fully functional orbiting space station by the end of the year. Meanwhile space tourism organised by Russia and private companies such as Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic and Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin is taking off. More sinisterly, a nuclear arms race in space will also accelerate. The US, Russia and China are all experimenting with new weapons, such as orbiting hypersonic glide vehicles capable of launching nuclear missiles from anywhere in the heavens. Russia caused anger in late 2021 with its reckless test of an anti-satellite missile. Others will follow suit, potentially threatening global communications. Not to be outdone, Nasa is planning to knock a giant asteroid off course in September by orchestrating a head-on collision, using a spacecraft launched on a rocket built by Elon Musk’s SpaceX. The US calls this “planetary defence” – but the technology plainly has offensive applications. Some will deem this progress, others a giant backward step for mankind.",News/World news,The world in 2022: another year of living dangerously,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/29/the-world-in-2022-another-year-of-living-dangerously
12/29/2021,"The west is “sleepwalking into the biggest humanitarian crisis of our times” in Afghanistan, Gordon Brown has warned, as he called for a support package to save the country from economic and social collapse after the Taliban’s takeover. Four months after the western-backed government was overthrown following a mass military withdrawal, the former UK prime minister said the case for action was not based only on morals but also “in our self-interest”.  He said more than half the Afghan population was facing extreme hunger, including 1 million children at risk of starving to death, citing International Monetary Fund predictions that the country’s economy would contract by 20-30% in the next year. “No country in recent times is suffering from such ‘universal poverty’ in the way that Afghanistan may do,” Brown wrote in an article for the Times. “It is ironic that when the whole international community is pledged to achieve the sustainable development goals – to free all the world from absolute poverty this decade – almost every citizen of Afghanistan will be condemned to that dire fate. “Instead of no absolute poverty in any country, we will have the horror of practically an entire country living in absolute poverty.” Brown stressed the effects may be felt within Europe, given thousands of Afghans would be faced with the choice of starving or emigrating. About $4.5bn (£3.3bn) should be pledged by countries to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, Brown urged, adding that the “largest humanitarian response ever agreed for a single nation” was required. He continued: “It cost America trillions to fight the war in Afghanistan. It is not beyond our capacity to find $4bn to prevent starvation amid this uneasy peace. “This tragedy foretold cannot be a tragedy unresolved.” Brown also said the frantic military retreat from Afghanistan, when tens of thousands of people tried to flee on evacuation flights before the last troops pulled out, signalled the end of the notion allies could “impose liberal western values overnight” in other countries. However, speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he cautioned: “What it cannot do is remove the obligation on each of us to understand that we are in an integrated and interconnected world where we are all affected by decisions that are made in other countries and we have got to do something to help those, particularly those who face starvation. “Otherwise, not just for moral reasons but for self-interested reasons, this will come back to haunt us.” According to the Disasters Emergency Committee, 8 million people are on the brink of famine in Afghanistan, while 95% of the entire population does not have enough to eat. The situation has been compounded by the Covid pandemic and the worst drought in 27 years – and is expected to get worse through the winter as temperatures drop. Prince Charles, who is a patron of the International Rescue Committee UK, recently urged people to donate to its fundraiser, calling the situation in Afghanistan “truly catastrophic”. Damning new light was shed on the UK’s handling of its withdrawal from Afghanistan earlier this month, when a Foreign Office whistleblower who helped sort requests for evacuation revealed the chaos and confusion at the heart of the operation. He said the government falsely claimed each request was logged, prioritisations were made with little consistency or checks and there was a lack of staff, experience and equipment.",News/World news,Gordon Brown: west is sleepwalking into Afghanistan disaster,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/29/gordon-brown-west-sleepwalking-afghanistan-disaster
