2/6/2022,"A rapturous reception greeted the double change, laced with excitement and relief. It was a new signing and a new beginning and if the Anfield public were happy simply to see Luis Díaz and Harvey Elliott on the pitch, they had further reasons to celebrate Jürgen Klopp’s substitutions. The January buy made an encouraging debut, the teenager made the ideal comeback and a day that threatened to be awkward for Liverpool started to assume a near-perfect look. For Díaz, an assist 11 minutes into his Anfield career was perhaps all the more auspicious given Klopp’s indelible association with pressing. He harried a dozing Perry Ng out of possession to tee up Takumi Minamino for Liverpool’s second goal. For Elliott, their third was his first for the club and while it was taken beautifully – the winger taking a touch to control Andy Robertson’s cross and swivelling to dispatch a half-volley – perhaps his presence on the pitch was a greater achievement. It was 147 days since he dislocated his ankle against Leeds, when the immediate reaction was to fear for his future. A swift return had a stylish conclusion.  And yet, even before Díaz’s introduction, Liverpool had evidence of Klopp’s aptitude for forward thinking. The previous attacker they recruited with Porto on his CV had already underlined his catalytic qualities. Diogo Jota cushioned Liverpool’s passage into the last 16 just as he propelled them into the Carabao Cup final. He has ensured they navigated a month without Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané while progressing in the knockout competitions. Jota ended Cardiff’s admirable resistance, a 15th goal of the season showing again that he has the spring to be a menace. He outjumped Mark McGuinness, a giant defender who is six inches taller than him, to glance in a header from Trent Alexander-Arnold’s free kick. Jota’s game is defined by elusiveness and irrepressibility in the penalty box; when he hooked a volley wide from a corner, he had contrived to be unmarked again. If the first half, when Liverpool mustered a solitary shot on target, had seemed an advertisement for the introduction of Díaz, Jota was again their liveliest attacker. While Klopp has been accused of taking the FA Cup insufficiently seriously in previous years, this time the manager press-ganging youngsters into service in a makeshift side was Steve Morison. Injuries and January sales were a factor, while two of his recent signings were cup-tied. It amounted to a daunting assignment for the teenagers Oliver Denham and Eli King, handed the maiden starts of their careers at Anfield. Denham could soon testify to its difficulties, when Jota baffled him with a deft turn before stinging the palms of Dillon Phillips with a crisp shot. Yet thereafter they were able to settle into the game. Liverpool had 82% of possession in the first half, but without their trademark intensity and with a wastefulness that was summed up when Alexander-Arnold’s volley went out for a throw. Naby Keïta was responsible for a couple of particularly wayward shots while Curtis Jones skied a shot over from Minamino’s cutback. Cardiff, meanwhile, could argue the turning point came in the first minute of the second half. Mark Harris proved an elusive figure in attack and, while he appealed for a penalty when nudged in the back by Ibrahima Konaté, referee Andy Madley faced a stiffer decision when Will Vaulks released the forward with a pass from deep in his own half. Harris escaped behind Konaté and Caoimhin Kelleher took the role of sweeper-keeper to the extreme by bringing him down 45 yards from goal. Madley opted for a yellow card, a decision upheld by VAR. They were to pull a goal back, taken expertly by the substitute Ruben Colwill, but only after Elliott and Díaz made their mark.",Sport/Football,Harvey Elliott caps return from injury by sealing win for Liverpool over Cardiff,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/06/liverpool-cardiff-fa-cup-fourth-round-match-report

2/6/2022,"Is there a better calendar we could use or invent? Evie Sutton, Manchester Send new questions to nq@theguardian.com.  One with a small chocolate behind the little door every day of the year please. SignificantOther Composers/artists La Monte Young and Marian Zazeela live in “extended time”. I believe each “day” for them is 35 hours long, with 8 hours for sleep; if one wants to interview or meet them, one has to fit in to this extended day; for example arriving at 3am to find them having lunch. Reedist There is a fixed ratio of Earth rotations to orbits of the sun. So whatever calendar we use would have 365¼ days in a year. Division into some convenient blocks like weeks and months falls down on there not being convenient factors. If we were starting again, then 366 might be an approximation to start with. Weeks of six days and months of 61 could work – other than one arbitrary “leap” day skipped most years. It would still leave unaligned weeks each month, unless we decided to have the first week of every new month being “new Monday” to “new Saturday”. That would involve “intercalary” days (“new Sunday”?) inserted at the end of six (or five) of the 61 (or 60) day months. We could of course allow for more intercalary days, something like the calendar the Romans used before Julius Caesar, where they had most years of 355 days, but some of 377 or 378 with an extra short month. The answer to the question, then, is whatever calendar you choose has some arbitrary fudging. Producing a worldwide consensus on an alternative is way too large a hurdle for minimal advantage, so extremely unlikely to happen. leadballoon There’s no intrinsic need to tie a calendar to solar, terrestrial or lunar cycles. It made sense to do that when those were among your most readily available periodic observables. Dorkalicious How about 10 months of 36 days each (four weeks of nine days with three- or four-day weekends), with the other five or six leftover days as a very long bank holiday at the end of each year. OhReallyFFS If you mean “accurate”, then the Persian Hijri calendar used in Iran is far better than the Gregorian calendar. It starts and ends a year on the actual observation of the spring (vernal) equinox. Years are either 365 or 366 days long with 12 months. The first six months are each 31 days long; months 7 to 11 are 30 days each, with the final month being either 30 or 31 days long. Unlike the Gregorian calendar, leap years are not regularly distributed according to a simple mathematical rule, but are instead inserted based on astronomical observations. The result is that the calendar only accumulates a one-day error in every 110,000 years compared with the one day every 3,236 years in the Gregorian calendar. Of course all calendars assume the Earth’s orbit around the sun and the length of the day are constant – which they aren’t. MikeRichards Arguably, that is not better than the Gregorian calendar. For the Gregorian calendar, (as you said) there is a simple formula that can be used in computer systems, including for future dates. For the Hijri calendar, it would be not just difficult, but impossible to work accurately with future dates where they depend on observations which have not yet taken place. In other words, a larger, predictable amount of “wrong” is better than “less wrong but unpredictable”. I worked in IT for 35 years and I have no idea how you would go about handling the future date case in the Hijri calendar, but I doubt that there is any very satisfactory method. mikecee A printer I once knew had printed his own calendar with two Fridays in every week. When I spotted it on his office wall he explained that it was the only way he had a cat in hell’s chance of fitting in all the jobs that customers wanted before the weekend. Nowadays, though, I don’t think calendars of any kind will survive for much longer – anyone can see that their days are numbered. ThereisnoOwl In June 1972, Isaac Asimov wrote an essay in the Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction that described a very easy to understand calendar system. Basically, there are four periods of 90 days plus a few holidays in between the 90-day periods to make the year come out to the right number of days. Rick Bergman Much of modern computing already does: it’s called Unix time, which began at midnight on 1 Jan 1970 [UTC] and increments in seconds. The switchover likely wouldn’t be all that hard in practice as it’s so well embedded today, albeit not too many people would immediately recognise that. It would lead to significant simplification in a connected world, as well as being easily distributed using protocols designed to do so while maintaining accuracy. As things stand, the clock can accommodate many multiples of the current age of the universe – but hold that thought, because in a few years (2038) there’s going to be a spot of trouble when older 32-bit technology can’t handle the latest standard (64-bit Unix time) runs into a bit of a problem at the end of the “first Unix epoch”. Dorkalicious I quite liked the idea of the Shire calendar, as described in Tolkien’s works. There were 12 30-day months, with an additional day at the end of the year and one at the beginning. These were at midwinter and called the Yule days. At midsummer, there were three additional days (four in leap years) called Lithe days. Mid-lithe day and the additional leap-year day were not given weekday names, and were kept out of the cycle of seven-day weeks. In this way the year always started with a Sterday (Saturday). Yule actually lasted six days, as the last two days of Foreyule (the last month of the year) and the first two days of Afteryule (the first month of the year) also counted as part of the Yule festival. Given the regular cycle of 30-day months, the adoption of a six-day weeks would make sense (abandon weekday names for all of the Yule and Lithe days), and give us the opportunity to ditch Mondays, because in common with most people, I don’t like Mondays. HiFiAlan We need it to be decimal, based on days. No hours, just decidays centidays and millidays and so on. No weeks months or years, just dekadays, hectodays, kilodays. No weekends, just a rolling three days off every dekaday, life expectancy about 25 kilodays. No annual reports, kiloday reports, which would encourage longer-term thinking, kiloday election cycles. We would get 2.74 summers every kiloday, and the same number of winters, but we would escape the tyranny of religious festivals and suchlike. Fewer birthday presents to buy. Easier payroll software. Let’s backdate it to 2000 so 01/01/2000 is day one of the Modern Decimal Era (MDE). Meet you in the coffee shop at 8072.052 MDE (half past 12, Sunday 6 Feb in old time), but in everyday speak you would probably say “see you at 72.05” unless you were planning well ahead. RichardCC A non-leap year consists of 52 weeks + 1 day. Converting to days: one year = 52x7 + 1 = 13x4x7 + 1 = 13x28 + 1 If we are ever able to overcome our superstitious attachment to number 12 and revulsion to 13, we could have a nifty 14-month calendar, with 13 months of equal length, 28 days, and a special month of length one day, the latter which will double in leap years. This way we don’t need to worry about those irritatingly irregularly alternating 30/31-day months, where July/August and December/January all have 31 days even though they are pairwise adjacent. Where’s the logic in that? When the superintelligent AI takes over the world as the universal philosopher-king in 2046, I might work up the courage to suggest this calendar design to its royal highness. trp981 Weeks are five days, with a working week of three days out of five. Months are six of these weeks. The year starts at the winter solstice. There are additional days at the equinoxes and solstices to bring the total to 365 (with leap years having six of these extra days). These additional days are holidays and aren’t part of the main weeks/months (eg the last day of the sixth month and 36th week is followed by the summer solstice holiday, which is then followed by the first day of the seventh month and 37th week). The system is natural and secular. It has no need to remember different lengths of months, and gets rid of financial difficulties that can happen for those with weekly wages and monthly bills. It makes a compromise in the proportion of time spent in the working week between what we have now and proposals sometimes made for a four-day week.

2/6/2022,"The healthcare company Johnson & Johnson is facing an attempt to force a shareholder vote to halt its sales of talc-based baby powder across the world, including the UK, amid concerns over alleged links to cancer. Johnson & Johnson (J&J) withdrew its talc-based baby powder from sale in the US and Canada in 2020. Sales of baby powder had dropped after US regulators detected carcinogenic chrysotile fibres, a type of asbestos, in a sample.  The company is now facing more than 34,000 lawsuits including many from women who claim they used baby powder and later developed ovarian cancer. The shareholder vote has been proposed by Tulipshare, a London-based investment platform which allows customers to pool their shares in order to meet the threshold to submit resolutions for shareholder votes. The proposal has been submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Committee (SEC) to consider if it is eligible ahead of J&J’s annual meeting, likely to be held in April. Talc, the world’s softest mineral, is mined in several countries, with uses across industries as diverse as paper, plastics and pharmaceuticals. Talc’s astringent properties mean it is used to treat nappy rash and for other personal hygiene uses. However, talc deposits can sometimes be contaminated with asbestos, a mineral that can cause cancer if its fibres enter the body. Corn starch can be used as a replacement. J&J strongly denies that its baby powder is harmful and said it only pulled the product in North America after a slump in sales “fuelled by misinformation around the safety of the product”. A spokesperson pointed to a 2020 cohort study that found no statistically significant increased risk of ovarian cancer with talc use. A spokesperson said: “We stand behind the ingredients we use in our products, and Johnson & Johnson has a rigorous testing standard in place to ensure our cosmetic talc is safe. Not only is our talc routinely tested to ensure it does not contain asbestos, but our talc has also been tested and confirmed to be asbestos-free by a range of independent laboratories, universities, and global health authorities.” The barrage of legal claims “have no valid scientific basis”, the spokesperson said. J&J’s lawyers, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, have written to the SEC asking that it exclude the shareholder resolution as ineligible because it would affect pending lawsuits in state and federal courts in the US and in other countries, including “thousands of personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer”. J&J has already spent billions on costs and settlements, including a $2bn (£1.5bn) judgment by a Missouri appeals court in favour of 22 plaintiffs who suffered from ovarian cancer. In October, J&J moved the potential liabilities for talc products into a separate company, which then entered bankruptcy in a highly controversial move that could limit its financial exposure. Ian Lavery, a Labour MP, last year sponsored an early-day motion in parliament condemning the “hypercritical and unjustifiable” decision by J&J to continue to sell talcum powder products outside North America. Lavery said he welcomed the attempt to force a shareholder vote. “It is shocking that products that we know can cause serious illness through contamination with asbestos are still available to buy in the UK, or anywhere else in the world for that matter,” he said. “Any action taken against Johnson & Johnson, who continue to profit handsomely from the sale of this harmful substance despite knowing its potential effects, is welcome in my book.”",News/Business,Johnson & Johnson faces push to force global ban on talc baby powder sales,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/06/johnson-johnson-faces-push-to-force-global-ban-on-talc-baby-powder-sales
2/6/2022,"Russia now has enough troops to seize the Ukrainian capital Kyiv or another city, but Moscow’s forces are not yet sufficient for a full takeover and occupation of the country, according to Ukraine’s former defence minister. In an interview with the Guardian, Andriy Zagorodnyuk said the situation now looked “pretty dire”. “Russia could now seize any city in Ukraine. But we still don’t see the 200,000 troops needed for a full-scale invasion,” he said.  His comments follow an ominous briefing by the Biden administration about the Kremlin’s military buildup on Ukraine’s border. The White House said on Saturday that Moscow had assembled at least 70% of the firepower it needs to give Vladimir Putin the option of a major military operation by mid-February. US officials have warned that a full Russian attack could lead to the swift capture of Kyiv and potentially result in 50,000 civilians killed or wounded. They said the Russian army had now positioned 83 “battalion tactical groups” near Ukraine, each with between 750 and 1,000 soldiers. The figure has risen from 60 battalion groups two weeks ago, they added. Speaking on Sunday, Zagorodnyuk said he did not believe a Russian invasion was inevitable. He said the remorseless Russian troop build up was proceeding along textbook lines but that the Kremlin’s intentions and strategy remained opaque. “We don’t see a political endgame here,” he said. “If Putin seizes Kyiv there will be full-scale war. The Ukrainian army forces will fight. There will be enormous resistance for all time. Why would you do that?” He added: “Ukraine is not going to say ‘Let’s join Russia’. This is understood. Unless, of course, Putin is totally delusional and has his own understanding of reality. There will be blood, sanctions. Nobody needs that kind of international war in Europe right now.” Zagorodnyuk said the US administration was right to release intelligence about Russian plans and capabilities. On Thursday, US officials claimed to have evidence of an elaborate plot by the Kremlin to make a “very graphic” fake video of a Ukrainian attack as a pretext for a military invasion. Downing Street said on Friday it had “high confidence” that Russia was planning to fabricate a reason for attacking Ukraine. Zagorodnyuk said the plot seemed “a bit exotic” but added that Moscow had previously carried out similar “false flag” operations. From Thursday, Russia will stage major military exercises with Belarus, within striking distance of Kyiv. According to the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, Russia has deployed 30,000 combat troops, elite Spetsnaz units, Su-35 fighter jets and S-400 missile defence systems. In total, there are now 135,000 Russian troops on Ukraine’s border. They are stationed close to the Donbas region in the east, where the Ukrainian army has fought a low-intensity conflict with pro-Moscow separatists for almost eight years. Russia has moved troops up into Crimea, in the south, which Putin seized and annexed in 2014. Its forces are also stationed in the breakaway republic of Transnistria, next to Moldova, in the west. US officials briefing on Saturday said 14 battalion tactical groups were on their way to the border from other parts of Russia. The US believes the Kremlin would want between 110 and 130 battalion tactical groups for use in a full-scale invasion, but stress that Putin could decide on a more limited incursion. Including support units, Russia could be aiming to have 150,000 troops in place for a full-blown military offensive, one US official said, adding that the buildup could reach that level in the next couple of weeks. Ukraine’s embattled pro-western president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, made Zagorodnyuk defence minister after winning a landslide election victory in 2019. Zagorodnyuk later left government and now runs a thinktank, the Centre for Defence Strategies. “Russia has increased its troop numbers in Belarus. They are getting ready for a potential invasion. The main concern I have is for Kyiv,” he said.",News/World news,"Russian troops ready to seize Ukrainian capital, says former defence chief",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/06/russian-troops-ready-to-seize-ukrainian-capital-says-former-defence-chief
2/6/2022,"Wayne Rooney has said he misused alcohol in an effort to cope with the pressure that accompanied his rise to elite level football as a teenager. The former England and Manchester United striker, 36, opened up about two-day “self-binges” in the early days of his career as he struggled with the exposure that accompanied becoming England’s record goalscorer after growing up on a Liverpool council estate.  “To go from that to having to deal with becoming a Premier League player at 16 and an international player was something I wasn’t prepared for,” Rooney told the Mail on Sunday before the launch of an Amazon Prime documentary about his life. “I had never even thought about the other side of being a football player. I wasn’t prepared for that part of life. It took a long time for me to get used to that and figure out how to deal with it. It was like being thrown in somewhere where you are just not comfortable. That was tough for me,” he said. Rooney, who appears alongside his wife, Colleen, and parents in the documentary, said his problems with drinking continued until his first son was born in 2009. “There were times you would get a couple of days off from football and I would actually lock myself away and just drink to try to take all that away from my mind,” he said. “It was like a binge. Normally, that’s with a group of lads but this was a self-binge … I would sit in the house and for two days I would just drink. “People might know that I liked a drink at times or went out, but there was a lot more to it than just that. It was what was going on in my head. It was just a buildup of everything ... pressure of playing for your country, for United, some of the stuff which came out in the newspapers about my personal life, just trying to deal with all that pressure which builds up.” Rooney said he had learned different coping mechanisms to manage his anger over the years, by sensing when an “explosion” coming and that he “needed to sit down and talk to someone”. “Over the last 15 years, I haven’t had very many nights out. I might have had 10 nights out, but the ones I have had ... four or five of them have given people big exclusives,” he said. It would have been impossible to share his feelings in the United dressing room at the timebut players were now “more empowered” to speak about mental health issues, he said. “Growing up on a council estate, you would never actually go and speak to anyone. You would always find a way to deal with it yourself. It was trying to cope with it yourself rather than asking for help.”",Sport/Football,Wayne Rooney reveals drinking binges to cope with playing pressures,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/06/wayne-rooney-reveals-drinking-binges-to-cope-with-playing-pressures
