4/27/2022,"Russia has been accused of seeking to blackmail Europe as the energy giant Gazprom confirmed it had halted gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, prompting crisis talks in capitals across Europe. In a statement, the Russian supplier said on Wednesday it acted in response to the failure by the two EU countries to make their payments in roubles. “Gazprom has completely suspended gas supplies to Bulgargaz and PGNiG due to absence of payments in roubles,” a statement issued by the company said. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, condemned the move, saying that fellow EU countries would come to Poland and Bulgaria’s aid. She said: “The announcement by Gazprom that it is unilaterally stopping delivery of gas to customers in Europe is yet another attempt by Russia to use gas as an instrument of blackmail. “This is unjustified and unacceptable. And it shows once again the unreliability of Russia as a gas supplier. We are prepared for this scenario. We are in close contact with all member states.” Von der Leyen added that the commission had been in talks with countries outside Europe to ensure gas supplies. She said: “We have been working to ensure alternative deliveries and the best possible storage levels across the EU. “Member states have put in place contingency plans for just such a scenario and we worked with them in coordination and solidarity. A meeting of the gas coordination group is taking place right now. “We are mapping out our coordinated EU response. We will also continue working with international partners to secure alternative flows. And I will continue working with European and world leaders to ensure the security of energy supply in Europe. “Europeans can trust that we stand united and in full solidarity with the member states impacted in the face of this new challenge. Europeans can count on our full support.” Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, had warned in March that those countries that were “unfriendly” over the war in Ukraine would have to change their method of payment for gas supplies. The European Commission had nevertheless said companies should continue to pay Gazprom in the currency agreed in their contracts, about 97% of which are in euros or dollars. Gazprom has also said it would stop transiting gas through the two EU countries to others such as Germany if it discovered any withdrawal of volumes from pipelines. “Bulgaria and Poland are transit states,” Gazprom said. “In the event of unauthorised withdrawal of Russian gas from transit volumes to third countries, supplies for transit will be reduced by this volume.” The Polish gas company PGNiG confirmed that supply had stopped but a spokesperson said its clients were still getting the fuel in line with their needs. The company said: “Cutting gas supplies is a breach of contract and PGNiG reserves the right to seek compensation and will use all available contractual and legal means to do so”. Russia supplies about 55% of Poland’s annual demand of about 21bn cubic metres (bcm) of gas. Russian imports account for more than 90% of Bulgaria’s gas needs but the government insisted that no restrictions would be imposed on domestic gas consumption for now.

4/27/2022,"One of the witnesses in Ben Roberts-Smith’s war crimes defamation trial has been arrested and charged over the alleged assault of a police officer. The former soldier, whose identity has been suppressed, faces two charges: obstruct, hinder, intimidate, or resist a commonwealth official; and cause harm to a commonwealth judicial or law officer. He gave evidence, called by Roberts-Smith, as part of Roberts-Smith’s defamation case against three newspapers he alleges defamed him in a series of articles that accused him of committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith, a Victoria Cross recipient, denies any wrongdoing. The charged former soldier, given the pseudonym Person X in Sydney local court on Wednesday, appeared via videolink from custody, wearing handcuffs, a blue suit and white shirt. He was granted bail subject to conditions, on a $10,000 surety, by magistrate Alison Viney.

4/27/2022,"The term is treacherous and sometimes unkind; Graham Caveney imagines taking revenge on it by writing “agoraphobia” in the middle of a page, surrounded by scary white space. In Greek, agora means marketplace and phobos means fear. But the condition is thought of as modern, or as a terror of modern amplitude. Those who experience it are caricatured as horrified by the spaciousness beyond the window. In fact “agoraphobia”, Caveney tells us, “is not so much a fear of going out as a fear of something dreadful happening whilst being out”. He writes with inside knowledge, as an agoraphobe not a doctor. At 19, travelling home from university for Christmas by coach, he had a panic attack on the M6, his world dismantled by the “horrifying symmetry” of the motorway. An only child, brought up in working-class Accrington, he had always been a little dyspraxic, or “cack-handed” as it was called. But this was new: primal fear – heart hammering, blood pounding, body in revolt. He survived the next three years by staying on campus and living within a 50-yard radius. But to the dismay of his parents, with whom he moved back in after graduating, the condition persisted (“at my most agoraphobic, everywhere outside my front door can feel like that original motorway”). Now in his 50s, he seeks to understand its origins. Being sexually abused by his head teacher as a teenager – as described in his 2017 memoir, The Boy With the Perpetual Nervousness – undoubtedly played a part: after his body was invaded, he distrusted boundaries. Growing up in a tight-knit Lancashire community, so his partner Emma jokes, was a factor too: his phobia was small-mindedness writ large. Later, for two decades, came booze: where psychiatry failed, alcohol came to the rescue, a coping strategy that “can work right up until the moment it kills you”. These days Caveney is sober, does yoga, is part of a support group, and makes a point of going out even on days he doesn’t feel like it. But dual carriageways still horrify him. His book isn’t a bland tale of how-I-got-cured; it’s intellectually curious, emotionally bracing and immensely erudite. Shrinks may not have helped (“At the last count I have seen: ten psychiatrists, a score of counsellors, two dozen therapists”) but imaginative literature amplifies his insights: Proust, Kafka, Ford Madox Ford, Anne Tyler, Sue Townsend, Helen Dunmore and many more. Two American writers are of particular interest to him: Emily Dickinson (the words “house” and “home” appear in 210 of her poems) and the novelist Shirley Jackson. There’s a chapter on Sigmund Freud and honourable mention of Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal, a pioneering specialist in the field. It is only recently that agoraphobia has been recognised as a predominantly female complaint. Two thirds of Caveney’s support group are women. With props to stabilise their instability – walking sticks, headphones, gloves, sunglasses, bags, dogs and wheelchairs – they come over sympathetically. Their presentations are diverse, as Caveney’s have been, variously misdiagnosed as epilepsy, labyrinthitis, vertigo, motion sickness, migraine and post-traumatic stress disorder. Wary of remedies he has tried – including meds that “instil a perplexed nonchalance, an unenlightened Zen” – he’s also dismissive of one he refused, “flooding”, through which agoraphobes are forced to confront their phobia full-on, “the most counter of counter-intuitive treatments”. Given the pain he has been through, he’d be entitled to a measure of anger. But his book is bright and funny, and full of telling quotes, whether culled from others (Charlotte Brontë’s Villette: “All within me became narrowed to my lot”) or drawn from his own experience: “Agoraphobes are the ultimate squares, arch conformists”; “Safe space: a concept which, for the agoraphobe, verges on the oxymoronic”. Where his earlier memoir was more conventional in form, this book proceeds through short, epigrammatic paragraphs, weighing evidence and testing ideas. It will hearten people who have agoraphobia, enlighten medics and teach outsiders all the lessons Caveney has learned.  On Agoraphobia is published by Jonathan Cape (£12.99).

4/27/2022,"The Greens have blasted the “racist” ban on dual citizens sitting in parliament while United Australia has called for changes to prevent distant relatives disqualifying bids for political office. The calls for reform come as Australian Electoral Commission eligibility forms suggest several Liberal Democrat candidates may have failed to renounce foreign citizenship in time to be eligible for the federal election. In 2017 and 2018 some 15 MPs and senators resigned or were ruled ineligible for the Australian parliament due to dual citizenship. The rolling farce triggered numerous by-elections and an inquiry into whether the presence of ineligible candidates distorts results and the ban should be repealed because it limits multicultural participation in Australian democracy. Former Liberal MP, now United Australia Party leader and member for Hughes, Craig Kelly, said the ban on dual citizens should stay to ensure MPs “have a single loyalty to Australia”. “However, the extreme interpretation that finds some Australians are excluded because of grandparents needs to be reviewed,” he said. “We’ve had really good candidates we’ve had to exclude due to citizenship issues.” In the AEC forms released on Tuesday the Liberal Democrat candidate in the Tasmanian seat of Clark, Ian Ramsden, disclosed that he was a citizen of the UK, but claimed to have renounced it on 15 April. Documents attached to support the claim appear to show he paid the fee to renounce on that date, but confirmation of the application being processed before the deadline was not included. The Liberal Democrat candidate in the Tasmanian electorate of Lyons, Rhys Griffiths, disclosed his father was born in Wales, but claimed his parents, grandparents and he held no foreign citizenships. An LDP spokesperson said he believed both candidates had renounced. The Liberal Democrat’s lead Queensland Senate candidate, Campbell Newman, said “amendments” were needed to clarify the ban on dual citizens. “The AEC questionnaire that goes with section 44 [of the constitution] is incredibly confusing. It is quite ambiguous.” He also criticised the ban on government employees running for office under section 44 as “probably at odds with community standards” and is “unfair”. Greens deputy leader, Larissa Waters, said “the exclusion of dual citizens is discriminatory and perpetuates the lack of diversity in our parliament”. “Around half of all Australians are either born overseas or have a parent who was born overseas. In a multicultural society, denying Australians from diverse backgrounds the opportunity to represent their community weakens our democracy.” The Greens have proposed constitutional reform to allow public servants and dual citizens to sit in parliament. In 2018 a bipartisan committee led by Liberal MP Linda Reynolds called for a referendum to reform section 44 but the option was rejected by the Turnbull government in favour of more transparent disclosures. George Razay, an independent candidate in Bass in Tasmania, disclosed that he is still a citizen of Syria. Razay told the AEC that to renounce his citizenship he would be required to return to the country and complete mandatory military service. Under Syrian rules, he also should have applied for renunciation prior to becoming a British citizen in 1992. He has since renounced his British citizenship. Greens candidate for Blaxland in Sydney’s west, Linda Eisler, disclosed she has a Hungarian father, but the Greens argue this only gives an entitlement to Hungarian citizenship which Eisler did not activate. Eisler said she was not a Hungarian citizen and she found the prospect “ludicrous” because she had “never applied or investigated” the option and had only visited the country once in 66 years. “It feels racist [if I were ineligible] when my father volunteered in world war two and showed loyalty to Australia. Being Hungarian has not featured in my life.” Hawa Arya, a Greens New South Wales Senate candidate in the unwinnable fifth spot, disclosed both parents had citizenship of Afghanistan, but claims she lost hers when she became Australian in 1991. The Greens are relying on an interpretation of Afghan law that because dual citizenship is not allowed, Afghan citizenship is automatically lost once another is taken up. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The United Australia Party’s candidate for Aston, Rebekah Spelman, disclosed to the AEC that her father, born in Canada, “remains a Canadian citizen to this day”. Spelman claimed she had never been a citizen of any country but Australia – despite the fact Canada grants citizenship by descent to children of one Canadian parent. Spelman said her declaration was accurate because citizenship by descent was not “automatic” – but she had renounced Canadian citizenship anyway out of an abundance of caution. “It was necessary to do it. Section 44 is just so broad – you have to do all this stuff.” UAP candidates in Farrer and Hunter told the AEC they did not know any of their parents’ or grandparents’ citizenship. The One Nation candidate in the Queensland seat of Forde, Seschelle Matterson, disclosed that her mother had Mauritian citizenship, which she claimed was lost at age nine when her mother travelled to Australia. Matterson contended that she was not a dual citizen as a result. One Nation’s campaign director said all its candidates passed a “rigorous screening process”, with 100 potential candidates not standing due to citizenship status.",News/Australia news,Australian minor parties condemn ‘discriminatory’ ban on dual citizens in parliament,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/27/australian-minor-parties-condemn-discriminatory-ban-on-dual-citizens-in-parliament
4/27/2022,"Kellogg’s, the owner of brands from Coco Pops to Special K, has launched a legal action against the UK government over new junk food rules that will ban some cereals from being prominently displayed on supermarket shelves. The cereal maker, whose portfolio also includes Cornflakes, Nutri-Grain and Crunchy Nut, is fighting the restrictions on promoting products high in fat, salt, sugar and salt (HFSS) that come into force from October as part of the government’s plan to tackle childhood obesity. The in-store promotion of junk food products will be limited, meaning they will not be allowed to be featured in high-profile locations such as checkouts, store entrances, aisle ends and in prominent positions in supermarket apps and websites. Kellogg’s argues the rules fail to take into account the fact that 92% of people eat cereal with milk or yoghurt, which changes the nutritional profile of its products and means they would not be classified as junk food. “We believe the formula being used by the government to measure the nutritional value of breakfast cereals is wrong and not implemented legally,” said Chris Silcock, UK managing director at Kellogg’s. “It measures cereals dry when they are almost always eaten with milk. All of this matters because, unless you take account of the nutritional elements added when cereal is eaten with milk, the full nutritional value of the meal is not measured.” Kellogg’s, which begins its legal action against the Department of Health and Social Care on Wednesday, said it has turned to the courts after attempts to “have a reasonable conversation with government” failed. The case marks an important test of the rule changes, which also include a ban on junk food advertising online and before 9pm on TV from next year. The government stands by the new regime and is fighting the Kellogg’s action to stop a precedent being set that could allow other brands to circumvent the restrictions. “Breakfast cereals contribute 7% – a significant amount – to the average daily free sugar intakes of children,” said a spokesperson for the DHSC. “Restricting the promotion and advertising of less healthy foods is an important part of the cross-government strategy to halve childhood obesity by 2030, prevent harmful diseases and improve healthy life expectancy, so we can continue to level up health across the nation.” The spokesperson added that obesity costs the NHS more than £6bn a year and is the second biggest cause of cancer in the UK. Kellogg’s has a history of fighting regulations against the promotion of junk food. In 2018, the company successfully overturned a ban handed down by the advertising regulator against a Coco Pops TV ad targeting children, despite criticism from health campaigners. Caroline Cerny, from the Obesity Health Alliance, said the latest move by Kellogg’s was a “blatant attempt by a multinational food company to wriggle out of vital new regulations”. “It’s shocking that a company like Kellogg’s would sue the government over its plans to help people be healthier rather than investing in removing sugar from their cereals,” she said.",News/Business,Kellogg’s to challenge new UK rules for high-sugar cereals in court,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/27/kelloggs-court-challenge-new-uk-rules-high-sugar-cereals
4/27/2022,"The prime minister’s office has refused to release any text messages between Scott Morrison and prominent QAnon supporter Tim Stewart, claiming they are not official government documents, following a two-year freedom of information battle. In October 2019, Guardian Australia broke the news that Stewart – whose QAnon Twitter account, BurnedSpy34, was permanently suspended for “engaging in coordinated harmful activity” – was a family friend of Morrison and Stewart’s wife was on the prime minister’s staff. Guardian Australia filed a freedom of information request for documents held by the prime minister’s office – including text messages – related to Stewart. This was later narrowed down to just the text and WhatsApp messages between the two men from September to October 2019, when the story was first reported. The prime minister’s office refused that request, stating it “presents a significant challenge to the day-to-day execution of his duties … the time that could be spent potentially processing your request would be a substantial and unreasonable diversion with the performance of the minister’s functions”. Guardian Australia then won an appeal to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) in late March this year, with acting commissioner Elizabeth Hampton ruling the prime minister’s office must process the request on the basis that “a practical refusal reason does not exist”. However, in refusing the request a second time, a senior adviser to the prime minister, John Harris, claimed text messages relating to the story about one of the prime minister’s friends and the husband of someone employed to work on the prime minister’s staff were not documents that fell within the scope of freedom of information law. “Your purported request relates to documents that, if they existed, would not fall within the meaning of ‘an official document of a minister’ as they would not relate to the affairs of an agency or of a department of state,” Harris said in a letter on Wednesday. The adviser writes that guidelines issued by the information commissioner state documents held by a minister that do not relate to the affairs of an agency include “personal documents of a minister or the minister’s staff”. The OAIC has in the past month ordered the PMO to process three other similar FOI requests it had previously refused. The prime minister’s office must issue a decision on two requests for text messages from Barnaby Joyce’s time as drought envoy to the prime minister, as well as for a request from Labor for documents relating to the scandal surrounding the doctored documents Angus Taylor used to attack the City of Sydney’s climate record. Taylor has always maintained that the document was not altered or forged by his office. In each instance, the OAIC found the PMO could not argue the demands on the office of the prime minister were such that narrowly-focused FOI requests could be refused. A potential appeal of Wednesday’s decision would mean another lengthy wait for the OAIC to make a decision. FOI law expert Peter Timmins has previously said if the government changed after the 21 May election the messages in question would probably not be retained by an incoming Labor government. “If … we have a different prime minister there by the time this issue is moved ahead, it’s very unlikely that records of [that kind] will be passed to the new prime minister, which would mean that you’ve run into a dead end,” he said. Stewart claimed in messages on Signal to fellow QAnon supporters that he was passing on letters and information to the prime minister, Crikey and the ABC reported after the Guardian’s initial story. The Four Corners program in mid-2021 raised questions as to why Morrison had used the term “ritual sexual abuse” in his apology to survivors of institutional child sexual abuse, revealing messages reportedly sent by Stewart referring to his attempts to get the words “ritual abuse” into the apology. The term had been prominent in QAnon circles. A spokesperson for the prime minister previously said the term “ritual” was “one that the prime minister heard directly from the abuse survivors and the National Apology to Victims and Survivors of Child Sexual Abuse Reference Group he met with in the lead-up to the apology and refers not just to the ritualised way or patterns in which so many crimes were committed but also to the frequency and repetition of them.” In 2019, Stewart denied to Guardian Australia that he had sought to influence the prime minister on policy, and said that he had not communicated with him about the QAnon conspiracy. At the time the Four Corners program aired, Morrison said the program was “pretty ordinary” and he did not support the QAnon conspiracy theory.",News/Australia news,"PM’s office won’t release any texts with QAnon friend, arguing they would not be ‘official documents’",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/27/pms-office-wont-release-any-texts-with-qanon-friend-arguing-they-would-not-be-official-documents
4/27/2022,"Australians have been urged to get their flu vaccinations to help hospitals cope in the months ahead as they deal with a rise in Covid-19 cases, and as some states experience double-digit daily death tolls. At least 42 coronavirus deaths were recorded on Wednesday in Australia, with 10 in New South Wales, 13 in Victoria, 10 in Western Australia and nine in Queensland. There were 4,027 Covid deaths nationally in the first quarter of 2022, data from the Actuaries Institute shows, including 1,668 in January, 1,520 in February and 839 in March. So far in April there have been 770 deaths. Prof Jason Kovacic, a cardiologist at St Vincent’s hospital in Sydney, said it was predominantly older, unvaccinated people who were most at risk. “The overriding picture is that we are seeing people in hospital with Covid who have underlying health conditions or are immunosuppressed,” he said. “It is still very random and rare that a fit, healthy and vaccinated patient will come in with severe Covid.” Kovacic said deaths were now occurring in people who had been in hospital for weeks, after a wave of Covid patients with chest infections and pneumonias. “We are in this in-between period where we are seeing patients where Covid has led to organ complications in their heart or lungs, or kidney failure,” he said. “It’s mainly those in their 50s, 60s and 70s with severe underlying conditions getting into trouble at the moment.” Kovacic said the hospital system was coping and was well prepared for any increase in hospitalisations over the winter months. But he said with influenza cases also on the rise, people must get vaccinated against the flu to reduce the burden. “This time last year the flu wasn’t such a concern, because we were all in lockdown or in isolation,” he said. “It’ll be different this season, and getting vaccinated against the flu is also something that’s really important to do.” Prof Allen Cheng, an infectious diseases physician at the Alfred hospital in Melbourne, said all Covid-19 deaths were tragic. “Underlying disease can encompass quite a spectrum of diseases, from high blood pressure to advanced cancer, and even in those with a limited life expectancy a death from Covid may still have taken away valuable time from their life,” he said. The cause of death can be difficult to attribute, Cheng said. “Some are definitely due to severe Covid,” he said. “Some are clearly unrelated, for example trauma. And some are complex, such as Covid in a patient with advanced cancer. “The clearly unrelated ones are not reported as Covid deaths, although sometimes they aren’t completely clear until the coroner makes a determination.” Unvaccinated people are overrepresented in deaths, Cheng said, highlighting the efficacy of vaccines.",News/World news,Australians urged to get flu shots as Covid deaths rise and winter sets in,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/27/australians-urged-to-get-flu-shots-as-covid-deaths-rise-and-winter-sets-in
4/27/2022,"Two members of the Windrush cross-government working group have resigned, citing unhappiness with ministers’ response to the Windrush scandal. Bishop Joe Aldred, and Arike Oke, who represented the Black Cultural Archives (BCA), informed the government last year that they were leaving the group. The Home Office has only this month published the new, smaller membership list, revealing it has shrunk from nine to seven people. Aldred said the group was a “fig leaf” and left in protest at the government’s failure to repeal hostile environment legislation introduced between 2012 and 2016, which caused problems for thousands of people who were unable to prove that they had the right to live in the UK. “If the government is really remorseful, then it should repeal that terrible legislation. I raised that several times, but there’s just no appetite for it,” he said. Aldred said the focus on reforming the Home Office was misguided. “The Home Office was merely acting as the handmaiden of the government and the laws they made. The government has no intention of changing those laws, so it is making the Home Office take the fall. It’s total hypocrisy.” He described the hostile environment legislation, rebranded compliant environment legislation, as “pernicious and unchristian”. The legislation, introduced when Theresa May was home secretary, outsourced immigration checks to landlords, employers, NHS workers and other untrained groups. Many people who were in the UK legally found themselves unable to prove their status, and lost their jobs and homes or were denied healthcare. The Windrush working group was set up to bring together community leaders and senior government officials four times a year to discuss reform of the Home Office in line with recommendations made by the independent inspector, Wendy Williams, in her lessons learned review. The group was also meant to “support the design and delivery of practical solutions to address the wider challenges that disproportionately affect people from BAME backgrounds”. The home secretary, Priti Patel, launched a comprehensive improvement plan for the department in September 2019. Williams last month noted some improvements in the Home Office but concluded that she was “disappointed by the lack of tangible progress or drive to achieve the cultural changes required”. She was critical of the Home Office’s failure to review the effectiveness of its hostile environment policies. Aldred also said he felt uneasy with the way that the national response to the Windrush scandal had perpetuated a negative narrative about the wider generation of people who came to the Britain after the second world war, the vast majority of whom were unaffected by the Home Office scandal. “I do not like the way in which it becomes generalised and we become an object of pity, when actually the story of the Windrush is about resilience and about enterprise,” he said. The BCA left the working group after the government published the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities report last year, written by Tony Sewell, another member of the Windrush working group. The report downplayed structural racism and concluded that the “claim the country is still institutionally racist is not borne out by the evidence”. The BCA said the report undermined the work of the Windrush working group. “We felt we could not possibly continue to work with the group after the report came out,” Dawn Hill, a board member at the BCA, with responsibility for Windrush issues, said.A Home Office spokesperson said: “We are committed to righting the wrongs of Windrush, which is why the insight and expertise of the members of Windrush working group is so hugely valued. We continue to work with the group on an ongoing basis on how to improve our compensation scheme, which has so far paid out £45m.”  ",News/UK news,Windrush group pair quit in protest at ‘fig leaf’ response to scandal,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/27/windrush-pair-quit-in-protest-at-fig-leaf-response-to-scandal
