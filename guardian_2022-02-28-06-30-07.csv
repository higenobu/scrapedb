2/28/2022,"As Kepa Arrizabalaga’s losing penalty kick soared high into the dark Wembley skies, still rising, some said, as it cleared Wembley Park tube station, the mass of Liverpool fans behind the goal produced a vast barrelling cheer, bodies tumbling, flares turning the night red. For the Chelsea end, relieved from glorious distraction of an apparently never-ending penalty shootout, the immediate future seems less clear. Perhaps some will call for change. Sack the charitable foundation! It wasn’t like this under Roman. Say what you like, he made the startlingly generous flow of private cash into a winning playing squad work. Either way, a losing Carabao Cup final felt like a suitably low-key day one for the post-Roman era; the alternate, rebooted Roman era, or wherever it is Chelsea FC finds itself heading off into right now. It was, a strange day all round. As Chelsea’s players missed chance after chance in the opening hour, as Mason Mount bludgeoned the ball into the advertising boards with all the finesse of man kicking an empty can of baked beans along the hard shoulder of the motorway, Thomas Tuchel could be seen beating the touchline turf with his fists, beseeching the Wembley skies, a tableau of agonised confusion. Yes, get it out Thomas. Because these are certainly fraught and interesting times. On the pitch this was an absorbing, ruminative cup final. Off it, this was football with a side order of European land war, the second-tier domestic cup competition spiced with a sense of impending mutual assured destruction. And right now everything about Chelsea FC seems fraught with macro-chaos. Not least the exact status of the club’s ownership. The idea that Roman Abramovich has handed over “stewardship and care” of the club, as per Saturday night’s weirdly casual official statement, is baffling enough. Really? Define “stewardship”. What about “care”? Can the trustees of the club’s charitable foundation decide to sell it? Can they buy a better centre forward or sack the manager? Or refuse to compete in the Champions League until Russian clubs are expelled? If not, why not? The Labour MP Chris Bryant has already suggested the stewardship stuff could be an attempt by Abramovich to avoid being caught up in the process of sanctions. Abramovich vehemently disputes any suggestion of his alleged closeness to Vladimir Putin and Russia or that he has done anything to merit being sanctioned. “I’m worried that this is a classic Russian ruse,” Bryant told the Guardian on Saturday, although his suggestion that Abramovich “could save himself a lot of bother by condemning Putin and his criminal invasion of Ukraine” is at least a chance for a little laughter in the dark. Let’s be clear, Abramovich could create a vast amount of bother for himself by saying that, whatever his past loyalties. And for now nothing has really changed. The club will receive its usual top-ups. The pounds 1.5bn loans have not been called in. The show goes on, sealed within that pool of distracting light. And Wembley was a chilly, crisp, crackly place at kick off, the thin afternoon sun creeping down the roof of the far stand. Football tends to do this. The world keeps on ending. Still people keep showing up asking where the party is. There was an early moment of apparently genuine absurdity as the in-house PA asked the crowd to stand so that Ukraine would know “the whole football family” supports them, even as death rains down on their houses and the bodies pile up in Kiev. This is of course nauseating double-speak. In reality the football family, led by its governing bodies, has spent the past 12 years legitimising Vladimir Putins’ regime, and bolstering his influence. The wretched, fawning Gianni Infantino has dishonoured his sport, and humiliated himself by padding after Putin like a needy puppy. Russian clubs are still in Uefa competitions. Russia are still en route to the World Cup. A club owned and funded by a Russian oligarch: well they’re out there right now dressed in blue. Meanwhile the game juddered on towards that apparently inevitable penalty shoot out. Édouard Mendy made an incredible double save midway through the first half. Both teams had goals disallowed And so the mind began to wonder. There was once a dream that was Roman. It is 19 years now since Russia’s most famous billionaire paid £140m to take control of Chelsea. It was a style-setting administration from the start. Two decades on, as he cruises from around the Med, still low key super-flash but essentially mute, oddly untouchable, it is easy to forget the glossy, celebrified aspect of Abramovich’s arrival in west London. Nobody really stopped to ask why he was here, or why he wanted to own Chelsea. Why would you? In the summer of 2003 the common response to the appearance of the English football’s first overseas billionaire was a collective gawp, a phwoar, a wa-hey, a vicarious drool at the flash, the show, the trappings of the post-communist uber-lad lifestyle. Abramovich owned a yacht with two heli-pads and its own submarine. He bought a house that looked like an embassy. He was a fun-loving billionaire. Of course this was normal. And everything was new in this picture. Vladimir Putin had come to power in Russia just three years previously. The fall of the Berlin wall was only nine years before that. Oligarchs: what were they exactly? How did this work, this evolving system of commerce and power? The assumption was that buying Chelsea offered a kind of “insurance policy”, a way of making himself known in another country, protected by his visibility. Does that seem right now? Does anything seem right? At Wembley there were Ukraine flags in both ends, and plenty in the blue end. The Chelsea Supporters’ Trust has made its feelings clear: “We stand with the people of Ukraine”. And, this is the strange lot of the football fan now. Blaming a club’s fans for the sins of its owners makes little sense. But it is quite possible to have a voice while still loving the team, the shirt, the players. That connection, that source of joy: none of it attaches to whoever the current owner happens to be. There are surely some Manchester City fans who will feel unease at this, to call those who borrow that shirt and crest to account. Within 10 minutes of that final penalty kick the Chelsea end was almost empty. Liverpool’s fans stayed to dance and shout and applaud the medals being handed out. This is a vital little notch on the belt for Jürgen Klopp, a first domestic trophy in a decade, and another step in the building of an era. For two hours at Wembley football had shut the doors on the world outside and staged its own show. For Chelsea, day one of the new world felt quite a lot like the old one. But it seems likely change is coming in one form or another.",Sport/Football,The fall of the Roman empire leaves Chelsea with an uncertain feeling | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/27/the-fall-of-the-roman-abramovic-empire-leaves-chelsea-with-an-uncertain-feeling
2/28/2022,"The north of England will be the principal battleground in the next general election, according to research that also concluded that there is no evidence of a southern “blue wall” ready to fall. The study by the Onward thinktank suggested that Labour could regain 31 seats in the north, Midlands and north Wales if 2019 Conservative voters switched back to their preferred party but as a result only three southern seats would change hands. The analysis found that 60% of battleground seats at the next election will be in northern England compared with 20% in the south and the Conservatives have a chance to gain ground in most of these seats. Constituencies that could be at risk of falling to the Tories include Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford where the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, is an MP, and the former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron’s seat Westmorland and Lonsdale. Researchers said there is no indication that a southern blue wall will fall in the same way the red wall did in the 2019 election. It also forecast that 49 seats in London and the south-east are drifting away from the Tories and could fall in two or three elections’ time. Will Tanner, director of Onward and former deputy head of policy to Theresa May, said: “The next election, like the last, will be won in the north of England. While the South is steadily becoming less Conservative over time, there is no blue wall waiting to fall across the home counties in two years’ time. “But there are dozens of traditional Labour seats in the north that could yet switch.” The analysis, which deployed the same methodology that identified the red wall in 2019, also found that 36 additional northern Labour seats would be vulnerable to the Tories at the next general election if overall vote share is in line with three years ago. Onward also found that the proposed Lib Dem-Labour pact would be insufficient for Sir Keir Starmer’s party to win a majority and the Conservatives would probably remain the largest party. It said that even in the scenario of a perfectly coordinated electoral pact – in which the second-placed party takes all the voters of the other – the Conservatives would still hold 321 seats while Labour would win 233 seats and the Lib Dems would have 24. James Blagden, chief data analyst and head of Onward’s Future Politics programme, said: “The heart of the Tory party has been shifting northwards for the last 30 years. “That trend is set to continue. But the greatest short-term concern for the Conservatives should be backsliding in the red wall, losing their iconic 2019 gains, and putting their majority at serious risk.”“The Conservatives stand on shaky ground, with their 2019 gains not yet secure and traditional southern heartlands slowly drifting away.” Meanwhile, separate research concluded that an election today would result in the Tories losing 164 seats, while only nine per cent of people polled said they believe that Boris Johnson “tells the truth”. The prime minister and ten cabinet members would be on course to lose their seats if voters went to the polls now, according to the MRP model projection which maps polling results on to every seat in the country. Researchers also found that the Tories would lose 164 seats, leaving them with 201, and Labour would have 352 seats, a gain of 150, with an overall majority of 14. The JL Partners poll of 4,500 people and the seat projection put Labour on 45 per cent of the vote, 13 points ahead of Boris Johnson’s party with the Lib Dems on 11 per cent.",News/Politics,"Next general election will be decided in north of England, says thinktank",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/27/next-general-election-will-be-decided-in-north-of-england-says-thinktank

2/28/2022,"When Trent Alexander-Arnold and Harvey Elliott converted their penalties in Liverpool’s flawless shootout they turned and pointed at a 23-year-old goalkeeper making the 17th start of his senior club career, and who just happened to be the calmest person inside Wembley. They shared the intuition that Jürgen Klopp had when deciding it would be Caoimhín Kelleher, not Alisson, standing in Liverpool’s goal for the Carabao Cup final. “If it works out, then it’s all about Caoimhín. If it doesn’t work out, then it’s all about me.” The Liverpool manager was correct, although he could never have predicted it would work out with Kelleher scoring the 11th and final penalty before the supposed spot-kick expert Kepa Arrizabalaga blazed Chelsea’s 11th attempt high into the Wembley sky. Kelleher was a prolific goalscorer for Ringmahon Rangers in Cork before trying his hands at goalkeeper aged 13. He has evidently not forgotten the goalscoring art. If it was a risk selecting the inexperienced Republic of Ireland international over a goalkeeper that Klopp has labelled the best in the world, it never showed. Kelleher, a most laid-back character, made a crucial save from Romelu Lukaku at the end of normal time and held his nerve throughout. The first of what Liverpool hope will be four trophies this season was a true collective effort, with 29 players used in the run to the final including all three senior goalkeepers. Klopp wanted Kelleher to taste the high life not only as a reward for his impressive displays throughout the competition but to ensure his head his not turned by offers to play more regularly elsewhere. The final was therefore a resounding success for Liverpool as they secured a record ninth win in the League Cup. The final itself was a test of Klopp’s improved resources. There were tears before kick off with Thiago Alcãntara distraught on the bench having been denied a first cup final appearance for Liverpool by an injury sustained in the warm-up. In came Naby Keïta for only his 13th start of another disrupted season for the Guinea international, with the 18-year-old Elliott promoted to the bench in his place. The disruption to Klopp’s plans felt sizeable. Thiago has produced arguably the finest form of his Liverpool career in recent weeks as Manchester City’s lead at the top of the Premier League has been gradually eaten away. His passing range, vision and influence on Liverpool’s rhythm would have been ideally suited to vast expanse of Wembley. Instead, the Spain international had to make do with a consoling arm around the shoulder from Alisson. Early impressions from Liverpool’s rejigged midfield were not convincing. Keïta was in a close confrontation with N’Golo Kanté and swarmed by blue shirts as the mobility of Kai Havertz, Christian Pulisic and Mason Mount exposed Liverpool in the early stages. The first of several glorious chances Chelsea squandered came when Havertz glided in front of Keïta in the build-up to Pulisic shooting straight at Kelleher from close range. A distinguishing feature of Klopp’s team, however, is how quickly and effectively they address tactical problems and, as in the rout of Leeds at Anfield on Wednesday, an uncertain start soon gave way to a performance of control and menace. Keïta, Fabinho and Jordan Henderson forced Kanté and Mateo Kovacic deeper, breaking the supply to Chelsea’s marauding front three in the process, and suddenly it was Édouard Mendy’s goal being peppered with shots. Luis Díaz’s seamless introduction to life at Liverpool continued with a high‑energy, prominent display on the left. His willingness to track back and accept his defensive duties also endeared him to the red half of Wembley. Liverpool lost some composure and creativity in midfield with Thiago’s untimely injury but Keïta’s willingness to support the attack brought Thomas Tuchel’s team a different problem. That was underlined when Sadio Mané found the midfielder arriving unmarked on the edge of the area and his low drive extended Mendy for the first time. Mané would have broken the deadlock from the follow-up but for a sublime reaction save from the Chelsea goalkeeper. Keïta did not trouble the Chelsea defence again although he did settle into the physical contest with Kanté and looked to release Díaz at every opportunity. He was involved in the final’s first exchange of hand-bags when catching Mount with an accidental elbow as the Chelsea midfielder attempted to counterattack. In the second half he was fortunate to escape a yellow card for catching the inside of Trevoh Chalobah’s thigh with a raised boot. Keïta’s number was up shortly afterwards when replaced by the veteran James Milner. An unexpected chance to shape an absorbing final had largely bypassed the £52.75m midfielder. But not Kelleher. His contribution in the shootout may have come with a shot instead of a save but it was decisive nonetheless. Liverpool answered Klopp’s call to enhance their trophy collection. There could be more for this buoyant team before the season is out.",Sport/Football,Caoimhín Kelleher keeps his cool to justify Jürgen Klopp’s faith,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/27/caoimhin-kelleher-keeps-his-cool-to-justify-jurgen-klopps-faith
2/28/2022,"Fifa has decided that Russia can continue their bid to qualify for this winter’s World Cup, despite their opponents refusing to play against them. As England became the latest country to say they will boycott matches against Russia following the invasion of Ukraine, Fifa finally ended days of silence on the subject only to effectively endorse the status quo. Under a series of “initial measures” agreed by the Fifa council on Sunday, next month’s World Cup play-off between Russia and Poland will go ahead but at a neutral venue and with no spectators. Russia will also be forced to go by the name “Football Union of Russia (RFU)” in an echo of the punishment imposed on the country at the Olympics. No Russian flag will be flown either, nor will the anthem be played. In a statement Fifa said they would be willing to consider further actions, including expulsion from the World Cup, should “the situation not be improving rapidly”. They said they had already “been in dialogue” with the Polish FA about the match, having “taken good note of the positions expressed via social media”. But Fifa’s proposal was immediately rejected by the Polish football authorities, who earlier this weekend had declared their determination to boycott any fixture with Russia, a sentiment shared by individual players including star striker Robert Lewandowski. The Poles were then joined in a boycott by Sweden and the Czech Republic, one of whom are scheduled to meet the winner of that tie in a play-off final. The president of the Polish FA, Cezary Kulesza, described Fifa’s decision as “unacceptable”. “In the situation of war in Ukraine, we are not interested in the game of appearances,” he said. “Our position remains unchanged: the national team Polish will NOT play against Russia in the play-off match, regardless of the name of the Russian team.” The Polish FA also took the step of writing formally to Fifa to reject the measures and call for Russia to be expelled from the World Cup. “The Polish Football Association inform that as a result of the brutal aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine and the war that continues there, we do not see any possibility of competing with the Russian national team in play-off matches for promotion to the World Cup in Qatar in 2022 regardless of the name of the team consisting of Russian footballers and the place of the match”, the letter read. “In the face of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which was condemned almost all over the world, this is the only decision we can make. A performance in a match against the Russian national team would be a shameful act not just for our players but for the entire football community, contrary to solidarity with the Ukrainian nation. As football association, we refuse to participate in play-off matches in which the Russian national team appears. “At the same time, we call on the Fifa authorities to react immediately to the brutal violence that we observe daily on the territory of independent Ukraine. If Fifa’s Human Rights Policy is more than just words on a paper now is the time to put it into practice by excluding the Russian Football Association from the qualifiers for the World Cup in Qatar in 2022.” On Sunday England joined that group. In an intervention made less than an hour before Fifa published their conditions, the Football Association said they would not play any international fixtures against Russia at any level “for the foreseeable future”. “Out of solidarity with the Ukraine and to wholeheartedly condemn the atrocities being committed by the Russian leadership, the FA can confirm that we won’t play Russia in any international fixtures for the forseeable future,” read a statement on Sunday evening. “This includes any potential match at any level of senior, age group or para football.” Earlier this weekend, each of Russia’s possible play-off opponents confirmed that they would refuse to fulfil the fixture. Poland and Sweden were joined on Sunday by the Czech Republic who said both officials and staff had agreed they would not play. “It’s not possible to play against the Russian national team in the current situation, not even on the neutral venue”, the Czech FA said, “We all want the war to end as soon as possible.” World champions France also said they supported the expulsion of Russia from international football, with Noël Le Graët – president of the French Football Federation – saying the sport “cannot remain neutral” following the invasion of Ukraine. “The world of sport, and especially football, cannot remain neutral. I certainly would not oppose the expulsion of Russia,” Le Graët told the French newspaper Le Parisien. As yet, Fifa has taken no action regarding the upcoming World Cup play-offs, due to be held next month, nor the possibility of Russia qualifying for the final tournament itself. In a statement last week, the world governing body would say only that it continued “to monitor the situation” and that “updates … will be communicated in due course”. Uefa took the decision to strip St Petersburg of the Champions League final on Friday and has also moved all fixtures involving Russian sides to neutral venues. Only one Russian club side, Spartak Moscow, remain in European competition this season, but on Sunday their upcoming opponents RB Leipzig said they were pressing for greater action from the governing body. “RB Leipzig is currently in intensive discussions with Uefa on the further course of action for the Europa League knockout-round matches against Spartak Moscow and expects a timely decision by the association,” the club said.",Sport/Football,Anger as Fifa decide Russia can continue bid to qualify for World Cup,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/27/anger-as-fifa-decide-russia-can-continue-bid-to-qualify-for-world-cup
