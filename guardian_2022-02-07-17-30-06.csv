2/7/2022,"Scientists and politicians “probably killed hundreds of thousands of people” by damaging the reputation of the AstraZeneca vaccine, according to an Oxford scientist who worked on the jab. Prof John Bell said: “They have damaged the reputation of the vaccine in a way that echoes around the rest of the world.”  “I think bad behaviour from scientists and from politicians has probably killed hundreds of thousands of people – and they cannot be proud of that,” he told a BBC Two documentary When the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab was rolled out in the UK government advisers recommended under-40 should be offered an alternative due to a link to very rare blood clots. Fears over the links to blood clots also led other countries, including Germany, France, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland, Denmark, Norway, Bulgaria, Iceland and Thailand, to pause their use of the vaccine. The AstraZeneca vaccine has also not played a significant role in the booster programme. The BBC reported it accounted for only 48,000 of the more than 37m booster doses given in the UK. The AZ vaccine was celebrated as a UK success story and billed as “Britain’s gift to the world”, when it was developed. It was designed to be cheap, and developers had the ambition that it should be available at low cost. Unlike the mRNA vaccines, it could be transported at low cost and stored at fridge temperature. Nearly half of the adult population in the UK received two doses of the vaccine. The AZ vaccine’s approval in the UK coincided with Britain’s separation from the EU. “I don’t think it made with relations with Europe any easier that it was promoted as the British vaccine,” Bell told the documentary, AstraZeneca: A Vaccine for the World, to be broadcast on the BBC on Tuesdayat 9pm. Before European regulators made their decision, Germany decided it should not be given to those over 65, and France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, called the vaccine “quasi-ineffective” in people over 65. The European Medicines Agency approved the jab for all adults of all ages. Both France and Germany later reversed their positions, the documentary says, but the reputation of the vaccine had been damaged. There were also major rows about distribution. The vaccine was being manufactured in both the UK and EU, but because the UK had been guaranteed priority in a deal signed before the rest of Europe, the company was unable to send vaccines from British plants to supplement EU stock. The overall risk of blood clots is very low – estimated at one in 65,000 overall – but slightly higher in younger adults. When European regulators declared that the vaccine’s benefits outweighed its risks, most lifted their suspension – but put age restrictions on the vaccine, the BBC said, When it came to deciding on booster doses in the UK, the clots issue and the simplicity of the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA jabs not being age-restricted, sealed the AZ vaccine’s fate. It is registered as a booster vaccine in the UK, but it proved simpler to give the majority of people Pfizer or Moderna – even though this was a more expensive option. Since then, evidence has shown that mixing different types of vaccine may offer better protection, according to the documentary.",News/Society,Doubts cast over AstraZeneca jab ‘probably killed thousands’,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/07/doubts-cast-over-astrazeneca-jab-probably-killed-thousands-covid-vaccine
2/7/2022,"Scott Morrison has signalled he will seek to legislate the religious discrimination bill “in the near future”, as mounting internal opposition leaves securing Labor support the most viable path to pass the reform. Morrison appealed for support for the “important bill” on Monday, telling reporters in Canberra that it is “something that should unite the parliament, not divide it”.  On Friday Labor MPs and senators on two committees joined the government in calling for the bill to pass after a series of minor and technical changes. Labor is using the wait for these amendments to stall finalising its position. The Coalition faces fierce internal resistance to the bill, with the member for Bass, Bridget Archer, telling Guardian Australia on Friday she can’t support it in its current form, and senator Andrew Bragg seeking protections for teachers and removal of the controversial statements of belief clause. Morrison has committed to preventing the expulsion of LGBTQ+ students, with varying levels of support from government MPs. It was enough to win Angie Bell’s vote, but Dave Sharma has also expressed concerns about teachers, while Katie Allen has investigated amending the statement of belief clause so it doesn’t override state laws. Trent Zimmerman and Warren Entsch have both reserved their position. Entsch told Guardian Australia he “never believed the bill should have been there in the first place”. “I’ll continue to negotiate,” he said. “But it’s interesting that even the Australian Christian Lobby, one of the main proponents, has threatened to pull the pin.” Christian groups were outraged about Morrison’s commitment that students would not be expelled for their sexuality or gender, as the attorney general, Michaelia Cash, had said these changes would follow more than 12 months after the passage of the religious bill. One such group, FamilyVoice, publicly doubted on Monday that the bill would ever see the light of day, with Greg Bondar, the New South Wales/Australian Capital Territory state director, arguing that introducing it so late in the term was “either politically astute planning or extremely poor legislative planning” as it may prevent a vote before the election. Morrison told reporters the Sex Discrimination Act changes “go well together” with the religious discrimination bill “which I intend to become an Act in the near future”, signalling a vote as early as Tuesday in the lower house. “It’s a very important bill,” he said. “It’s a bill that means that a Sikh family can go and rent an apartment and not be discriminated against.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Morrison said the bill would also ensure “people can speak their beliefs” in society or in the workplace. “We will continue to work with our colleagues on the measures that they have raised,” he said, when asked about Archer’s vocal dissent. “My hope … is that it is a bill that will bring Australians together around this issue. “There is nothing in this bill that seeks to prejudice others, it is a bill that is designed to protect religious expression in this country to ensure that people who have such beliefs are not discriminated against.” In addition to protections for students, Cash has suggested the statements of belief clause could be softened to ensure employers can still ensure safe workplaces. Labor has insisted they must see the final bill before they come to any position. Earlier on Monday the Australian Council of Trade Unions president, Michele O’Neil, the ACTU assistant secretary, Liam O’Brien, and the Independent Education Union addressed a group of Labor MPs, reiterating their concerns with the bill. The ACTU submitted to the Senate inquiry that “all sections and parts of the bill that are inconsistent with existing anti-discrimination laws should be removed, including all provisions overriding state and territory anti-discrimination laws”. If Morrison pushes ahead with the bill, Labor has not ruled out teaming up with Liberal moderates or crossbench MPs and senators to support amendments adding protections for LGBTQ+ teachers and students or to remove the bill’s other contentious clauses. Michelle Rowland, the shadow communications minister, told reporters the government appears “deeply divided” on the religious discrimination issue. “We have long recognised in Labor the importance of ensuring that people aren’t discriminated on the basis of their religion and we have made that clear … but we are not the government bringing forward a bill or bringing forward government amendments,” she said. Kristina Keneally, the shadow home affairs minister, played down the prospect of backlash against Labor if they passed the bill. Asked if Labor faced “grassroots revolt” over the bill, Keneally said no, because religious and equality groups understand “we are a multicultural, multi-religious country”. “We respect one another and we want to see people’s rights upheld, and we want to see our responsibilities towards one another honoured and respected,” she said. Labor MP Graham Perrett, one of the members of the joint human rights committee that examined the bill, said there are “serious concerns” about the statements of belief clause. Perrett said that “any sensible member of parliament” would support prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of religion, but Queensland has had such protection since 1991. “I can see how parliamentarians would want something that brings people together and not cause division. “I would hope that the prime minister, who has a long history of ‘wedge-islation’, would focus on doing the right thing by all Australians, not [on] a short-term political manoeuvre.” But some in Labor argued it should use the moment to be rid of an issue that hurt it engaging with religious communities at the 2019 election. “There’s an opportunity to draw a line in the sand and have this behind us once and for all,” one Labor parliamentarian told Guardian Australia. “We need to stop talking about things the public don’t want us to talk about.”",News/Australia news,Morrison signals attempt to pass religious discrimination bill ‘in the near future’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/07/morrison-signals-attempt-to-pass-religious-discrimination-bill-in-the-near-future
2/7/2022,"Conservationists in Zambia have hailed a high court injunction preventing deforestation and commercial agriculture on the edge of Kasanka national park, which they say threatens the world’s biggest mammal migration. Every October, about 10 million straw-coloured fruit bats descend on the swamps of Kasanka from across Africa and beyond. They feast on fruit in and around the park, one of Zambia’s smallest but under the highest level of protection, dispersing seeds across the continent on their epic journey.  Park officials warned last year that the bat migration could disappear if proposals for farming in the park’s buffer zone were approved, which involved drawing on water from the Luwombwa River, which passes through the protected area, and clearing thousands of hectares of habitat. Last month, a high court judge in Zambia granted an interim injunction against two companies – Lake Agro Industries and Gulf Adventures – restraining them from cutting down trees, clearing land, fencing off areas and taking water from the river pending a full trial. Kasanka Trust, which co-manages the protected area and brought the case with two community groups, told the court at a hearing in November that the companies had cleared hundreds of hectares of native forest, diverted parts of the river for their own use and constructed roads, an airstrip and permanent dwellings in the area. Both companies had failed to comply with stop orders from Zambia’s national park authority, the trust said. A high court judge, Mr Justice Kafunda, granted a temporary injunction, pending a full trial. A breach of the interim injunction could lead to criminal charges for the companies. No date for the trial – where parts of the Zambian state would also be sued – has been set, and it is believed the process could take years. James Mwanza, general manager of the trust, said the decision was a cause for celebration, but cautioned it could be a temporary victory. “For too long, some of Zambia’s most important habitats, including Kasanka, have been threatened by the illegal activities of private companies with no consideration of the adverse effect this has had on local communities which depend on the land. The court’s ruling strengthens our continued efforts to protect the environment,” said Mwanza. Lake Agro has not responded to a request for comment and the Guardian was unable to contact Gulf Adventures. Previously, Chuma Simukonda, head of Zambia’s Department of National Parks and Wildlife, said that while he welcomed investment in the country’s agricultural industry, another site for the commercial farm must be found.

2/7/2022,"Barring a Thomas Tuchel-style Champions League triumph that seems about as likely as Bryan Robson mounting a comeback in Manchester United’s midfield, Ralf Rangnick’s candidacy for the full-time manager’s role is probably at an end after exiting the FA Cup to Middlesbrough. Should he even want it but a flaw in the plan is becoming apparent. Rangnick was reported at the weekend to have taken on a PR advisor for his six months as interim manager before a two-year consultancy role that will involve working with the next, “permanent” boss. That Rangnick has been unable to arrest much of the slide that occurred under Ole Gunnar Solskjær does his credibility in that future role little good. Though a few leading football men can say that after involvement with United in recent years. The FA Cup may have lost its former importance but five years without a trophy is significant, a key indicator that the slump is long past a blip. John Brewin  Report: Man Utd 1-1 Middlesbrough (Boro win 7-6 on pens) West Ham were fortunate to avoid what would have been a famous upset at Kidderminster but their exit from Aggborough was dignified. After the game West Ham’s players, including Declan Rice, showered with Kidderminster’s to make use of the roomier facilities in the home dressing room, while Russell Penn and his assistant, Jimmy O’Connor, shared a post-match beer with David Moyes in his manager’s office. Several players swapped shirts and after heading out of the tunnel Rice, escorted along the main stand by a burly security guard, stopped to sign countless autographs and pose for photos with young Kidderminster fans. “I was sat on the floor and their striker came and picked me up and said, ‘don’t be down, you’ve done unbelievable,’” said the Kidderminster defender Matt Preston. “Rice came in afterwards and said: ‘You deserved more from that game.’ They were all very nice – they weren’t massive time at all, which you sometimes get.” Ben Fisher Match report: Kidderminster 1-2 West Ham (aet) Chelsea’s players flew straight off to Abu Dhabi for the Club World Cup after their tight, slightly fortunate extra-time defeat of League One Plymouth, which feels like an extended oxymoron in itself. They departed without Thomas Tuchel, who now faces a battle with his own immune system plusthe endless rigmarole of PCR tests to have any hope of joining them. Tuchel will miss the chance to work with his players, but it seems unlikely the problems with Chelsea’s attack are down to a lack of attent,ion on the training field. Romelu Lukaku was again a vague meandering figure, and looks like man simply in the wrong place. The manager’s period of self-isolation will no doubt be spent poring over his options, but it will soon be time to question Tuchel’s own capacity to draw more from that portfolio of diverse creative talent. Barney Ronay Match report: Chelsea 2-1 Plymouth (aet) Michael Olise may have stolen the show again for Crystal Palace with a goal and an assist, but Patrick Vieira reserved his highest praise for the club’s supporters. After Palace donated £1,000 to the JustGiving page of the Hartlepool manager Graeme Lee’s wife following her brain cancer diagnosis, fans’ donations mean it has now surpassed the £60,000 target. “I would like to pay tribute to all the Palace fans who have helped support Graeme Lee, his wife and family by making donations,” Vieira wrote on Twitter. “What you have done in the last couple of days has made me very proud. This shows a really good side of the game and is what our club is all about.” Lee added: “The last time I looked before the game it was about a year’s supply of medication for my wife and knowing that is absolutely unbelievable to know that we’ve got our medication there for another year.” Ed Aarons Match report: Crystal Palace 2-0 Hartlepool Frank Lampard drew a line in Everton’s season at his first press conference as manager, purposely emphasising the quality at his disposal and refusing to dwell on inherited problems on and off the pitch. The clean slate approach reaped rewards as Brentford were dominated in the FA Cup and the 43-year-old basked in the biggest win of any Everton manager on their competitive debut. It was not only young talent such as Anthony Gordon who benefited - “He’s got all the attributes to do what he wants in this game,” said Lampard - but the likes of André Gomes and Mason Holgate thrived on the palpable release of tension and negativity that had afflicted the club under Rafael Benítez. The trick will be to repeat the performance at Newcastle. As Holgate admitted: “When people like the boss and Ashley (Cole) come in you are a little bit in awe of them really. The boss told us he believed in the quality of the squad and we showed we have got that in us, but we have got to keep working on what we are going to do.” Andy Hunter Match report: Everton 4-1 Brentford Liam Delap made a first appearance of the season following a long run of injuries, the 18-year-old entering for Jack Grealish on 77 minutes in Manchester City’s 4-1 win over Fulham. Pep Guardiola said the striker has to force himself into the manager’s long-term plans. There is a confidence the son of former Stoke and Republic of Ireland midfielder, Rory, has the requisite temperament. “He will dictate to me,” said Guardiola. “It depends on his behaviour and his performance. Now he is a player who is training every day with us and you cannot imagine the improvement from him. Today there are a lot of distractions off the pitch – I can control what happens on the pitch, but to be a top player you have to be [exemplary] on and off it. With Liam, his father works at Stoke [as a coach] and has come from the world of football so he knows exactly what he has to do. But we are not guards here, we cannot control players. It depends on them.” Jamie Jackson Match report: Manchester City 4-1 Fulham Given football’s culture of complaining, there is something admirable about a manager who endorses a refereeing decision that goes against his team. When Caoimhin Kelleher hacked down Mark Harris, Cardiff were drawing at Anfield and there were two reasons to argue the card should be red, not the yellow Andy Madley showed. The goalkeeper was a long way out, but perhaps it was a clear scoring opportunity. Maybe it was serious foul play. Both the referee and VAR decided not and, rather than looking for a hard luck story, Steve Morison agreed. “I don’t think it was a sending off, there were too many players around,” he said, instead finding fault with his forward. “I was more disappointed Mark Harris didn’t take the ball around the goalie and put it in the goal.” It was a laudable stance, even if the temptation is to think it will never catch on when others play the blame game. Richard Jolly Match report: Liverpool 3-1 Cardiff Much has been made of Nottingham Forest’s shrewd recruitment since they changed transfer policy in the summer to focus on younger players but it should be noted the number of talents coming up through the academy. Joe Worrall captained the side, while Brennan Johnson and Ryan Yates also played key roles in the win over Leicester. In years gone by, Matty Cash and Patrick Bamford started their careers at Forest, proving how much success they have at youth level. Johnson and Worrall have attracted interest from the Premier League and many scouts will be watching the versatile Yates. Forest, however, will be hoping all three on show in the FA Cup triumph will stay at the club next season, whether they make it up or not. On the upside, should they leave, it will make the club plenty of money. Will Unwin Match report: Nottingham Forest 4-1 Leicester The manner of Luton’s victory dampened the Cup fever at Cambridge’s Abbey Stadium, where a marquee with bar and pumping PA system had been set up behind the main stand. Both managers’ selections bore the evidence of an EFL schedule that would have certain Premier League bosses squealing in outrage. Luton have played eight matches in 2022, Cambridge have played 10. Nathan Jones, the Luton manager, made eight changes while Mark Bonner was without two heroes of victory at Newcastle, goalscorer Joe Ironside and defender Jack Iredale. Luton’s push for a Championship play-off spot sees them host Barnsley on Tuesday while Cambridge’s League One assignment is a trip to Gillingham, a relentless workload. Carlos Mendes Gomes, talking after a first Luton goal, got his post-match wish of Chelsea in the fifth round draw. After struggling with Plymouth, Thomas Tuchel’s men face an organised and tough opponent who exhibited their depth and quality at Cambridge. JB Match report: Cambridge 0-3 Luton For those who measure happiness in wing-backs, shooting envious glances at Graham Potter is the norm. And despite Tottenham’s Saturday night intensity, the sense that Antonio Conte’s sextet of options bring him little joy lingers. Conte’s suggestion that Dejan Kulusevski – a natural No 10 – could fill the role is telling. For now, Potter has arguably the Premier League’s best pairing in Tariq Lampteyand Marc Cucurella. Emerson Royal had an excellent cup tie but summer change is afoot at Spurs. Should Conte fancy a Lamptey reunion - the player was in the academy during his time managing Chelsea – at least a zero will need adding to the £4 million he supposedly cost Brighton. Sam Dalling Match report: Tottenham 3-1 Brighton There was something cruel about the way Kidderminster’s hopes were crushed – twice – by West Ham at Aggborough on Saturday. Victory for the Harriers would have been a bona-fide shock for the ages against a supremely strong Premier League team – one that could have merited a place for replays of Alex Penny’s goal alongside those of Sutton United’s Matthew Hanlan and Wrexham’s Mickey Quinn when FA Cup giant killings were discussed in the future. Over at Stamford Bridge, the European champions took an extra 30 minutes to avoid what would have been an almighty shock against Plymouth, who led early in the game and then missed a penalty in extra-time that would have taken the match to spot-kicks. So we have to be thankful to non-league Boreham Wood for injecting the fourth round with some more romance late on Sunday as the 37-year-old Mark Ricketts’ goal secured a dream victory at Bournemouth to secure a fifth-round tie for the first time in the club’s history. That it is at Everton, where Wood’s impressive young manager Luke Garrard will get the chance to lock horns with Frank Lampard, only adds to the allure of the tie.

2/7/2022,"Appearing on state television, military officers read from a statement, calmly announcing the takeover of the state. In the capital’s streets, crowds celebrate, cheering as the coup is roundly condemned outside their country. It is a scene that has played out on multiple occasions in recent memory in west Africa – in Mali in 2020 and again in August last year, in Guinea in September, and in Burkina Faso just last week. Coups have also taken place to the east, in Chad and Sudan. As recently as Tuesday, an attempted coup was thwarted in Guinea Bissau.  At an urgent Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) summit of west African leaders on Thursday, Ghana’s president, Nana Akufo-Addo, reflected the alarm in regional capitals. “Emerging threats in our region … stem from the military’s interference in Mali and its contagious influence in Guinea and Burkina Faso,” he said. Ecowas did not immediately adopt sanctions against Burkina Faso, as it did after the coups in Mali. Its lack of opposition to controversial constitutional changes and democratic failings has fuelled questions about its effectiveness at supporting democracies and preventing coups. In Mali, Chad, Burkina Faso and Guinea, young military officers aged between 38 and 41, largely from special forces units, took control of power from ageing, democratically elected leaders. While the specific contexts differ in each country, numerous underlying factors and major challenges facing the some countries in the region have come into focus. Across the Sahel, jihadist conflict that began in Mali over a decade ago has left millions of people exposed to relentless attacks and caused one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. Jihadists have exploited failures by governments to tackle corruption and provide inclusive governance in low-income, ethnically diverse countries. The impact of the climate crisis has added to insecurity in a region reliant on agriculture. A lack of opportunities for young and fast-growing populations, and a proliferation of weapons, are other factors. Rising insecurity was cited by coup leaders in Burkina Faso and Mali. In Guinea, the military criticised political corruption following disputed elections. Many in Burkina Faso had grown angry with the government before last week’s coup, especially over the scale of mass killings by jihadist groups in the last year. Insurgency has left 1.5 million people displaced in the country. “People are dying daily. Soldiers are dying. There are thousands of displaced,” said a protester celebrating the military takeover last week. “This is an opportunity for Burkina Faso to retain its integrity.” In November, 53 people, including 49 gendarme militia forces, were killed when jihadists attacked a camp in Inata. Compounding the grief were reports that many of the militia forces died hungry as the base had run out of food supplies, said Ibrahima Maiga, an activist and co-founder of the Movement to Save Burkina Faso, a prominent protest group. “The president [Roch Kaboré] never went to the burial of any soldier who died in the last six years. He rarely ever visited the soldiers who were harmed during the combat. People felt like he never cared,” he said, describing how changes by Kaboré to top government and military officials at the end of last year were not enough. Protesters from Maiga’s movement celebrated the coup, and the new regime has planned talks with civil society groups in the coming days after talks with opposition groups. “The military has many people’s confidence,” said Maiga, adding that questions of democracy or military dictatorship were less critical because of the security crisis. “We love freedom, democracy, yes. But we are here at the level that we are trying to survive. The most important thing is providing safety and security.” Years of jihadist insurgency have led people in the region to question the military, political and economic influence of the former colonial power, France, which is scaling down Operation Barkhane, the anti-insurgent operation it started in August 2014. The coups have forced people to reflect on whether democracy has resulted in tangible benefits, said Idayat Hassan, director of the Centre for Democracy and Development thinktank in Abuja. “West Africans have become quite republican. They provide their [own] food, generate their own electricity, infrastructure. They expect just a little from the state but the state still fails expectations,” she said. “They cannot see what democracy has brought, so in come opportunistic militaries that see these governance vacuums and are trying to fill it.” There is also popular frustration that the international community often sound the alarm when coups occur, and not when democracies are routinely undermined. “There is a focus on elections being free and fair, and not enough focus on the way democracies are undermined,” said Hassan. “Ecowas and the African Union continue to monitor elections without any form of preventing what happened with [Alpha] Condé and [Alassane] Ouattara,” she added, referring to constitutional changes in Guinea and Ivory Coast to allow those countries’ leaders to serve controversial third terms. Both won referendums that were rejected by opposition groups as fraudulent. “Those were constitutional coup d’etats,” she said. Observers worry that support for coups suggests that populations increasingly see coups as the answer to unpopular governments. In Mali’s, capital Bamako, for instance, many thousands have rallied in support of the junta, including after unpopular Ecowas sanctions were imposed. But the support for militaries has not been universal. Operations by national armies against jihadist groups have led to serial human rights abuses, often in rural areas where the conflict is most acute and where people will probably be less supportive of the military, said Oumar Bâ, assistant professor of International Relations at Cornell University. “Many of the demonstrations showing support for these military regimes are in urban areas. But the people who live in the cities have a different perception from people who live in the rural areas, where you’re likely to find more worry,” he said. According to a west African diplomat, Ecowas was finding it challenging to maintain pressure on military regimes to commit to transitions to democracy without alienating local populations. “Some of the sanctions have been tough, but produced complicated situations, like in Mali, where they are really suffering from those sanctions now, but the people seem to be supporting the junta even more. I think there is definitely some soul-searching going on on how to deter these coups more effectively.”",News/World news,Contagious coups: what is fuelling military takeovers across west Africa?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/07/contagious-coups-what-is-fuelling-military-takeovers-across-west-africa
2/7/2022,"The first thing Rajiv Shrikul does when he opens up his launderette in south Edinburgh each morning is pray. He says the 7am routine, which he started as a young boy in India, helps him cope with the kaleidoscope of personalities that pass through his shop. “Some people are angry, some are generous – you need to have a very stable mind. Meditation calms you down, especially in these hard times.” Photograph: Murdo MacLeod  After opening in 1977, Braidburn launderette became a social hub, drawing in households that lacked the space or funds for their own machines. But Braidburn’s future is uncertain, like so many launderettes. These longtime staples of urban living have been hit hard in the pandemic and they, and their customers, are struggling with the cost of living crisis. When Scotland went into lockdown, Shrikul’s revenue tumbled by 80% – and customers are only now trickling back in. “Suddenly, nobody was coming through the doors. I only stayed open because my elderly customers needed me to pick up and wash their clothes.” Rajiv Shrikul loading a tumble dryer. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod Customer and regular visitor Arthur Mafonko with his dog Milo. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod Normally, during the Edinburgh festival fringe, tourists would pile into Braidburn to do their washing, but the last two summers have been quiet. The absence of students – another of his biggest client groups – also dented his cashflow. Danial Kochak, who helps his dad Masoud Kochak run the Barbican launderette in London, says their loyal group of regulars cushioned the financial impact of Covid. The launderette’s mouthwash green palette harkens back to the early 1970s, when it opened. While locals have been using its services for decades, Kochak’s earnings now pale in comparison with the value of the land the launderette sits on – property prices in the Barbican district have risen by 60% in the last 10 years, according to Land Registry data. Launderettes’ margins are further thinning as energy prices soar across the country. Kochak recently upped his tumble dryer fees by 20% to £1 for eight minutes. “Gas has jumped from 5p to 17p/kWh in six months. Owners will have to either weather it, put their prices up, or shut up shop,” says Bruce Herring, chair of the National Association of the Launderette Industry (NALI). But with many owners reluctant to pass the price rise on, businesses are being pushed to the brink. Masoud Kochak. Photograph: Sarah Lee In the last five years, the number of UK laundry facilities has fallen by more than a third to 2,000, according to the NALI. Developers remaking urban neighbourhoods for students and young professionals are building homes equipped with washing machines, leaving local launderettes without clientele. “We’re a throwaway society, so some people would rather buy a new duvet than have it professionally cleaned,” says Kate Yeats, a Braidburn customer. Because most tumble dryers in launderettes are gas-heated, the government’s plan to phase out gas power by 2035 is also stoking fears, Herring says. “Converting the machines to use electricity isn’t really an option as it is so difficult – and the running costs would be three times more than gas.” The Barbican launderette. Photograph: Sarah Lee The soaring energy bills come as prices rise faster than at any time in the past three decades. Braidburn customer Fraser Howie, 25, who runs a taxi business in Edinburgh, says he is close to breaking point, with spiralling fuel and insurance costs hampering his already slow recovery. “I’m worried about how businesses will survive if something changes or another Covid variant crops up. Taxi drivers have received hardly any government help, meaning some of us previously making £70,000 a year have had to live off a £3,000 grant. How are we meant to afford everything that we had?” Greta Riaukaite. Photograph: Sarah Lee Greta Riaukaite, a 25-year-old carer for elderly residents on the Barbican estate, recently moved further out from London’s centre to Brent, for cheaper rent. She now pays £830 a month for a studio flat, but may need to move again as the high cost of living, combined with stagnant wages, pushes the capital out of reach. “I do love London, but it’s so financially straining. Everything has gone up – travel and food bills especially,” she says. Another Barbican launderette regular, who only identifies himself as Raymond, says his pension barely covers the £1,733 monthly rent for his one-bed flat on the estate. A sad consequence of coronavirus has been its muffling of launderette gossip. Waiting customers would cover all kinds of topics, from dream holidays to their daughter’s wedding dress. “People used to chit-chat for hours, but I have had to ban them from staying because they cannot be socially distant in my small shop,” says Shrikul. Arthur Mafonko, a guesthouse owner, has used Braidburn for decades. Since working together in restaurants 30 years ago, he and Shrikul have been inseparable friends. “He has always been there for me,” says Mafonko. He opened a restaurant in early 2020 but due to Covid, the business never got off the ground. Pandemic restrictions also hit Mafonko’s new business, which suffered cancellations in December after the Scottish government advised families to reduce social mixing. “We have just been keeping the business afloat, waiting for the good times to return,” he says. Scenes from the Braidburn launderette. Photographs: Murdo MacLeod As the squeeze on households continues, the launderette – and its multicultural, multigenerational kind of fellow feeling – offer a balm. “I really enjoy my job, getting to have coffee and a wee chat. My oldest customers have become family,” says Shrikul, who took over the Braidburn five years ago. As a single parent, he found the role suited him much better than his long hours working as a waiter. Whenever he hears of deaths among his regulars, he always tries to attend their funeral. “Doing my home visits to pick up or drop off laundry means I often get to have a final chat with my customers, who have become part of my life.

Photograph: Sarah Lee Since the sudden death last year of Raymond’s wife of 50 years, Hazel, his routine of meeting neighbours at the launderette every Thursday goes a little way towards healing his private anguish. “I’m very fortunate to have such a strong community at the Barbican,” says Raymond, 96. “People here check up on me.” The retired civil servant joined the parachute regiment during the second world war at 16 years old. He lied about his age to get in, he says. Though he survived 18 missions in Germany, France and Palestine “without a scratch”, all of his friends died in combat.

2/7/2022,"Although public physical contact has not been a defining feature of the last couple of years, London’s sex clubs are experiencing a renaissance, thanks to a generational shift. Think: fewer key bowls and CEOs in expensive lingerie, more pioneering house DJs and art students in makeshift harnesses, as younger crowds drive demand for events that foreground inclusivity, individuality and queerness. For smoke machines and St Andrew’s crosses, try Klub Verboten. For hedonism with a sense of humour, you’ll want Adonis. And for women and non-binary people, One Night offers a blend of Japanese rope bondage and R&B. Between them all lies Crossbreed, a night where underground stars such as Shanti Celeste and Tama Sumo DJ to a room full of techno fans who can partake in everything from exhibitionist orgies to solo cups of tea in a dancefloor-adjacent wellness sanctuary. “The [queer fetish] community has long been dominated by gay men, who have rightly claimed and taken up space,” explains Alex Warren, who founded the event in 2019. “But that has left bisexuals, pansexuals, lesbians, trans and non-binary people with fewer non masc-dominated spaces to call home.”  While some events veer towards exclusivity, with membership systems and high ticket prices, Crossbreed – which has hosted events across the UK and is opening a new permanent home in London in February – aims to be as accessible as possible. Its parties have a femme-only play space, where women and non-binary people can party away from men, and there’s a mutual aid ticket scheme to help those on low incomes. Warren says they positively discriminate on the door to make space for trans, non-white and disabled people. And the dress code is strict: you won’t get in wearing jeans. “It’s not designed to weed out cis straight men – it just so happens cis straight men are put off dressing up,” Warren says. “And if they are made to dress up, there may be a discomfort that lends to them feeling less entitled.” Fetish gear can be daunting for anyone, however. The first time M, 27, had tickets to Crossbreed, they almost bailed. “Everyone always looks so good in the pictures and I ended up panicking with 12 bras on the bed in front of me,” they remember. Soon after they arrived, though, they were helping a stranger whose suspenders kept pinging off. “We laughed a lot and made jokes about how everyone’s arse was out and I felt immediately comfortable.” Crossbreed staff wearing light-up armbands monitor inappropriate behaviour. “We call it ‘perv patrol’,” says M. “Obviously, there’s like 1,000 wasted people there so it’s a really hard job, but I’ve never felt unsafe. They make a tangible effort to challenge the unhealthy sides of kink – mainly creeps who ignore consent and make other people uncomfortable.” While some people go to fetish events to “play” – the BDSM scene’s sweet, euphemistic term for sex – what keeps most people coming back to Crossbreed is the combination of music and community. “I’ve not been to any other fetish party of the same scale that has the same degree of diversity and inclusivity,” says Tom, 33, who is non-binary. “I feel so accepted and un-judged at Crossbreed. I can be who I feel I am, and feel safe in doing so.” Warren is the resident DJ, performing under the moniker Kiwi, and also has a Crossbreed record label. “People come to dance. We just happen to create space for further hedonistic adventures,” says Warren, who started their event after navigating three “parallel universes” – DJing, partying in London’s queer/gay scene, and exploring its fetish community – and finding very little integration compared with other European cities such as Berlin. Uniting these three worlds is perhaps why Crossbreed has gone from an itinerant rave to selling out Fabric in just three years – two of which were eaten up by the pandemic. “People have had a lot of time to reflect and to find deeper understandings of their sexuality, gender, politics,” Warren suggests. “Crossbreed has become a natural home for a lot of these people.” It has the political concerns Warren mentions at its heart, too. As well as featuring hot people wearing relatively little, Crossbreed’s Instagram page starts conversations around sensitive topics such as racism in kink and how to respond to abuse without “cancellations”. Between the parties, there have been workshops on consent and bystander intervention. The aim is to help people hold each other to account, both inside the club and in daily life. “You’re not just coming to a dance, you’re active in creating a space that strives to be utopian,” says Warren. “A place where you can feel seen, desired, liberated and euphoric – something that sits adjacent to cis-heteropatriarchy and white supremacy.” Their jargon might have some older kinksters rolling their eyes, but Warren’s heartfelt political acumen is vitally meaningful to their attenders, like M, who is now a Crossbreed regular. “It has more of a ‘night out with your mates’ vibe than other events. When I’m on the dancefloor and everyone around me is so happy and queer, it feels like I’m in exactly the right place,” they say. “Getting the tube in full latex is dreadful, though.”  Crossbreed begins its weekly residency at Colour Factory, London, on 13 February.",Arts/Music,An orgy and then a cup of tea: Crossbreed and the new boom in sex clubs,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/07/crossbreed-queer-friendly-techno-future-of-sex-clubs
2/7/2022,"My home, like many people’s, is a place of solace and comfort. It’s somewhere I’ve worked through the end of a long-term relationship, hosted parties, waged an ongoing war with a squirrel in my garden and housed my extensive condiment collection. Despite my emotional ties to this place, I do not own it. Like the other 13 million people in the UK who rent, that puts me in a permanently precarious situation. I am at the behest of a landlord, who can evict me for no reason, at any time. In this state of uncertainty, you can be reminded of your powerlessness at any moment. That moment came for me and my housemates towards the end of last year, when we found out that our landlords were considering selling. So what did three young professionals with no rich benefactors but an unusually large understanding of housing policy do? We decided to try to turn our house into a cooperative.  The housing cooperative movement has become a striking alternative to a profit-driven housing market. In simple terms, turning a house into a co-op brings a property under collective ownership, where members can come and go and ensure that a house remains under not-for-profit ownership in perpetuity. Once the cost of the property has been paid off, rents in the co-op can drop to the minimal levels needed to fund repairs and other minor costs, forming a home that can be rented affordably and well below market rate. It’s also sustainable – any surplus rent saved can be used to get other housing co-ops off the ground. The modern cooperative movement has origins in 19th-century England and France, with one of the first housing cooperatives appearing in Spotland Road, Rochdale, in 1861. Cooperatives are still found across the world today (in Sweden, 23% of homes are cooperatives). Here in the UK, however, the sector is far smaller and the movement has slowed over the past 50 years. There have been some notable exceptions, and cooperatives have received some political support from the Green party. But in the UK, there are are mere 685 housing co-operatives in total. The low figures are partly due to the immense rise in property prices since the 1980s, coupled with a lack of government support and a cultural obsession with private homeownership. Advice on the process of creating a co-op is often outdated. There are some archaic guides, usually written in the early millennium around the birth of the internet. A 2003 guide by Radical Routes recommends, endearingly, fundraising “to cover telephone, postage and stationery” costs. The lack of recent guidance on how to create your own co-op points to a struggling movement. However, it is far from impossible. If you already have a property in mind, the first step is building a business plan – which in its most basic form is a spreadsheet that works out the projected cost of the project (though at a final stage this becomes slightly more complex). This business plan would include the cost of paying back a mortgage, paying other costs such as stamp duty and ground rent (if it’s a leasehold), bills and housing insurance. Ethical lenders such as Triodos Bank will lend you 70% of the cost of the property against your normal rent, rather than your collective incomes, so you’re probably going to have to find the money for the other 30% yourself. That’s another row in the spreadsheet. At the end, you divide this number by the number of tenants, and you create an estimated monthly rent. You’ll need to get the landlords to agree to sell at an affordable price – potentially slightly below market rate (you are saving them estate agent fees, guaranteeing a chain-free sale and making them feel morally righteous, after all). After that, you incorporate the cooperative with a name, and register it for a small fee with the help of cooperative organisations such as Catalyst Collective. With all the above, you must then apply for a mortgage, find that 20% or fundraise for it, create co-op rules, and finally, buy the house. Ta-da: you have a co-op. In many ways, it’s a perfect solution to the housing crisis. By increasing the cooperative housing stock, co-ops create more affordable rooms and reduce the number of private tenancies that statistically are of a poorer standard, subject to unregulated rent hikes and no-fault evictions. They also ensure the house remains something for people to live in rather than an asset (a concept that has bemused many friends of mine). In sentimental terms, tenants suddenly regain control over the space. In London, where rent can make up 38% of renters’ incomes (or more if you’re young), it’s one of the few prospects for stable, affordable living. Of course, building a cooperative is not easy in today’s housing market. Historically, fundraising 20% of a property’s value was achievable. Indeed, many co-ops began as squats. Today, when house prices in the capital are 448% higher than in 1971, it’s crippling. By our calculations, we may have to find at least £100,000 upfront in order to turn our home into a cooperative, on top of the monthly costs to pay off the mortgage, stamp duty and other associated costs. That would bring up our monthly rent by hundreds of pounds, making the prospect unviable. Right now, turning our house into a co-op seems like an unrealistic prospect. Our landlords are receptive to the idea but of course would like to realise the best price for their property. The motivation to find some small way to evade the crippling housing crisis in this country is overwhelming, and between the Trello cards and Excel spreadsheets, I’m trying not to give up hope on our housing co-op just yet.

2/7/2022,"“Napoleon’s use of the sheep was notable,” says Jordan Daughtry, 14. She’s clutching a copy of Animal Farm, and referring to the authoritarian Berkshire boar who seizes control of an English acreage, before bending his fellow animals to his will. The sheep, who represent the unwitting masses in George Orwell’s critique of Joseph Stalin’s totalitarian rule, are “ignorant buffoons”, Daughtry says.  Jordan’s sibling, Kiara Daughtry, 16, continues the thought. “It did kind of remind me of the whole ‘stop the steal’ thing,” Kiara says, referencing the January 6 insurrection, when Donald Trump’s supporters, spurred by a wave of lies by the then president, besieged the US Capitol. “And all that nonsense.” The Daughtrys are sitting in the back of Firefly bookstore, a gem of new and used literature in the small town of Kutztown, central Pennsylvania. Huddled together on foldout chairs, facing down a table laden with muffins, pretzels and a stuffed toy pig, they’re members of Kutztown’s Banned Book Club, which meets every two weeks to read and discuss literature that conservatives across the country are working to ban from school libraries. Kiara Daughtry, left, and Lena Cackley. The book club members, all aged between 13 and 16, are gathered at a time of crisis. In the past year the book-banning movement has already seen works that mostly address race or LGBTQ issues removed from libraries in Texas, Utah, Virginia, Wyoming and Pennsylvania. Like many young people in the US, the members of the Kutztown Banned Book Club feel the censorship closing in. In December, the Pennridge school district, 30 miles from Kutztown, removed the children’s book Heather Has Two Mommies, a picture book about a lesbian couple and their child, from elementary school libraries. Last year, Pennsylvania’s Central York school board banned a long list of books, almost entirely titles by, or about, people of color. The ban was overturned in September after students protested. “I love to read, so it’s kind of frustrating to see the bans, especially because a lot of adults are banning it, but they’re not asking teenagers our opinion on these books,” Joselyn Diffenbaugh says. A softly-spoken 14-year-old, sporting bangs and a plaid shirt, she founded the Banned Book Club in response to the sweeping prohibition in the US. “It’s scary to know that all these people who might need these books for a reason, because maybe they’re just learning about themselves, and they need something to read, they don’t have access to that.” Joslyn Diffenbaugh. ‘I love to read so it’s kind of frustrating to see the bans.’ Last week the issue gained extra attention, after the Pulitzer-winning Holocaust graphic novel Maus: A Survivor’s Tale was banned from classrooms in McMinn county, Tennessee, by the local school board. The board objected to “rough, objectionable language” in the book, which describes the experiences of author Art Spiegelman’s parents in Nazi concentration camps, and his mother’s suicide. Maus has since become a bestseller on Amazon. At Firefly, the book club is discussing Animal Farm when I join them. The allegorical novel has not been targeted in the recent banning wave, but it was banned in the USSR until the Soviet Union fell, and in the UK during the second world war – when the government felt its publication could anger their Soviet allies. It was later banned in Florida – where it was seen to be “pro-communist”. Next on the reading list will be The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas, an award-winning young adult novel about the shooting of a young unarmed black man by a white police officer, which has been removed from various school libraries. But right now the conversation moves from Napoleon’s hold over Animal Farm’s sheep to why none of the animals simply left the farm. A copy of George Orwell’s Animal Farm. Right, Jesse Hastings. Bridget Johnson, who at 13 is the youngest in the group, but shows no fear in joining in the conversation: “I can kind of see that happening with real people in real life. Not knowing, not risking it, not changing anything.” There are echoes of Animal Farm’s manipulation, mistruths and – as one book club member put it – “gaslighting” in the movement to outlaw books in the US. The effort has been spearheaded by groups, which claim to be grassroots efforts, petitioning school boards or elected officials to remove certain books. In reality, many of the groups involved in banning books are linked to and backed by influential conservative donors. Most of the books relate to race or gender equality, at a time when some Republicans are mounting an effort to prevent teaching on race in schools by launching a loud campaign against critical race theory, an academic discipline that examines the ways in which racism operates in US laws and society. The book Gender Queer by Maia Kobabe, which tackles the hardship of coming out and discovering one’s gender identity, is one of the most banned. Since it was published in 2019, it has been challenged by groups in at least 11 states, including Texas, Florida and Pennsylvania. Clockwise from left: To Kill a Mockingbird, The Handmaid’s Tale, Thirteen Reasons Why and Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone. Elsewhere, Toni Morrison’s The Bluest Eye, a novel which addresses racial and gender oppression, was recently ordered to be removed from school libraries in Florida and Missouri. Out of Darkness by Ashley Hope Perez chronicles a love affair between a Mexican American girl and a Black boy in 1930s Texas. Over the past year it has been banned in multiple states. “I was disappointed that it was being allowed to happen, it just didn’t make sense to me that it could happen like that,” Johnson says of the spate of bans. Johnson, whose mother is waiting in a car outside the bookstore while the group meets, likes reading but says she is a slow reader. “I find it way easier to read with other people, and then talk about it. So I have a whole group of people to talk about it with.” Her dad, who used to serve on the Kutztown school board, has been particularly animated on the topic. “I hear him rant about it,” Johnson says. As for the efforts, which are happening increasingly close to home, Johnson said any attempts to ban books at her school would be misguided. “It would suck!” she says. Elijah Sicher, left, and Jillian Rager. “And usually it’s out of hate from that person, like against a community. A little kid, it’s not going to make them a certain way, it’s going to help them find out they’re a certain way.” After an hour and a half, the book club draws to a close. The pig, placed on the table to represent the pig elites of Animal Farm, is removed, and relegated to a place on a shelf. Jesse Hastings, a tall 16-year-old with dark glasses, holds a new copy of The Hate U Give – all the book club’s literature is funded by a wave of donations – as she heads out into the brisk Kutztown night. Hastings, who had offered assured commentary during the Animal Farm discussion, says she was “shocked” by the spate of bannings: “And especially for some of the ridiculous reasons that some books are being banned.” “A lot of the books were banned just because they had Black representation of LGBTQ representation,” she says. “Especially for young kids who are queer, or are people of color, it’s really important to see representation if books, and if you aren’t allowed access to that then that can be detrimental.” The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas. Right, Bridget Johnson, who at 13 is the youngest of the group. As well as the impact on people who might have found kinship with banned authors, or representation in now-restricted books, Hastings says there is another unsavory aspect to all of this. “It is a major issue, because already there’s a huge lack of representation of minorities in novels. And you know, there’s banning of books that discuss politics and things. “I think it leads to a lot of kids being a lot more closed-minded.”",News/US news,"‘Adults are banning books, but they’re not asking our opinions’: meet the teens of the Banned Book Club",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/07/banned-book-club-pennsylvania-animal-farm
2/7/2022,"The Chinese streaming platform Tencent Video has restored the original ending to the film Fight Club after it amended the Chinese edition to tell viewers police had “rapidly figured out the whole plan and arrested all criminals”, prompting a widespread backlash. The wholesale reversal of the anti-capitalist, anarchist denouement to the 1999 hit film, which stars Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter, made international headlines last month.  In the edited version, Edward Norton’s character, the narrator, still kills off his imaginary alter ego Tyler Durden, but a subsequent scene showing high-rise buildings being bombed was cut. Instead, viewers were shown a blank screen with text telling them authorities had won out. “The police rapidly figured out the whole plan and arrested all criminals, successfully preventing the bomb from exploding,” the text said. “After the trial Tyler was sent to lunatic asylum receiving psychological treatment. He was discharged from the hospital in 2012.” Beijing has some of the world’s most restrictive censorship rules with authorities approving only a handful of foreign films for release each year – sometimes with major cuts. But reversing endings is rare. The changes came to light after viewers in China who had seen the original watched the locally available edition. Censorship or banning of foreign films in China is common, but the wholesale reversal of Fight Club’s ending drew shock and mirth. “Fight Club on Tencent Video tells us that they don’t just delete scenes, but add to the plot too,” one user complained at the time. Human Rights Watch described the cuts as “dystopian”. Over the weekend the original ending was restored, according to domestic social media film accounts. That decision too drew criticism. Some netizens said it showed that Tencent was admitting that the original censorship was “too much”. Another asked: “If the original version can also be launched, why did Tencent modify it without authorisation? Tencent has been contacted for comment.

2/7/2022,"Scientists and conservation groups are calling for one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes to be rerouted in an effort to protect the world’s largest animal. Since 2008, researchers have been painstakingly piecing together clues about a little-known, endangered population of blue whales that live off the southern tip of Sri Lanka. What they have discovered so far hints at one group of cetaceans or even a sub-species. Rather than migrating vast distances like most blue whales, the Sri Lankan population is thought to live in the region year-round, grazing on tiny shrimps and communicating via distinctive vocalisations.  What has also become clear is the immense threat they face. The whales’ habitat overlaps with a major shipping artery that connects east Asia to the Suez Canal, leaving them vulnerable to ship strikes and noise pollution. On an average day the whales face off against a relentless barrage of about 200 ships, many of them container ships or oil tankers that stretch up to 300 metres in length. “The problem for these whales is that they live in a giant obstacle course that we have created,” said Asha de Vos, a marine biologist who launched the first long-term study of the region’s whales in 2008. It is a clash playing out in increasing intensity around the world. Between 1992 and 2013, the shipping traffic swelled 300%, as maritime transport became a fixture in roughly 90% of world trade. In Sri Lanka, the push is now on to tackle what De Vos describes as a “uniquely resolvable issue”, after research suggested that a small shift in the shipping lane could make a big difference to the whales. Her longstanding push to move the shipping lane has been backed by a trio of international conservation groups, which have formally called on the Sri Lankan government to propose the route change to the International Maritime Organization. “Studies indicate that if a shipping lane were to be established 15 nautical miles to the south of the current lane, the risk of collisions with blue whales would be reduced by 95%,” read the letter from the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), Great Whale Conservancy and OceanCare. For ships travelling across the world, the 15-nautical mile shift was “insignificant”, said Sharon Livermore of IFAW. “This tiny little shift in the location of the shipping lane would make a huge difference to the conservation status of these whales.” While there are no firm numbers on how many whales live in the area or how many have been killed by ships, in recent years several carcasses have turned up bearing signs of collision. “The risk is so high that we know that there must be many more being killed than are being reported,” said Livermore. “The blue whale might be the largest animal on the planet – these ones are about 22 metres long – but they pale in significance against a 300-metre cargo ship.” The rerouting would also benefit the country’s thriving whale-watching industry and small-scale fishing communities, whose boats have been spotted bobbing perilously close to mammoth vessels in the shipping lane. “There isn’t opportunity for manoeuvre – the ships can’t suddenly change their course if they see a whale or a fishing boat in their path, so the only way to reduce the risk is to move those ships away from this critical area,” said Livermore. Her organisation first approached the Sri Lankan government about moving the shipping lane in 2015, calling it a unique opportunity to protect blue whales, 90% of which were slaughtered by whalers in the 20th century. Others have also made overtures. In 2017, the World Shipping Council, which represents most of the world’s shipping companies, urged the Sri Lankan government to consider the move, as did the International Whaling Commission in early 2021. The previous Sri Lankan government refused to sign off on the proposals, citing concerns in 2019 about the economic impact of the move. The country’s Marine Environment Protection Authority did not respond to a request for comment. The vast majority of the ships using the lane do not stop in Sri Lanka but only transit through the area, said De Vos, suggesting the economic cost of the move would be minimal. “None of us want the industry to stop using our waters or for the industry to collapse,” she added. The heavy cost to Sri Lanka from shipping was made clear in May, after a cargo ship laden with toxic chemicals caught fire, dumping a hazardous mix of pollutants into the waters off Colombo. The spill poisoned the waters, left nearby beaches coated in plastic pellets and covered stretches of water in an oil slick, in what was described as the country’s worst-ever maritime disaster. The tragedy struck a nerve with many people in Sri Lanka, said De Vos. Now she hoped the sentiment would extend to protecting the “unorthodox whales” that share the country’s waters. “They’re so different to blue whales anywhere else in the world. It’s not just that it could be a separate subspecies, it has a different dialect, different feeding habits, different behaviours,” she said. “We could start losing a culture of whales.”",News/Environment,"Change lane, whales ahead: Sri Lanka urged to reroute shipping traffic",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/07/change-lane-whales-ahead-sri-lanka-urged-to-reroute-shipping-traffic
2/7/2022,"Australia will open its border for fully vaccinated tourists and all visa holders, a decision branded “bittersweet” by those who have missed funerals in recent weeks due to ongoing restrictions. Scott Morrison on Monday announced the nation would open to all fully vaccinated visa holders, including tourists, on 21 February, almost two years after borders were first closed.  The borders have been progressively opening since November, but some groups including bridging visa holders, some immediate family members and tourists were yet to be allowed exemption-free travel. The announcement on Monday provoked mixed emotions among those who have remained trapped by ongoing restrictions in recent months, including for Gold Coast resident Amy Jade Newsome, who is on a bridging visa while she waits a decision on a skilled worker visa. Newsome was denied a compassionate exemption to attend her aunt’s funeral in the UK last month, meaning she would have been trapped abroad if she had left Australia. “It’s bittersweet and almost like the timing, it just couldn’t be any worse, I guess,” Newsome told Guardian Australia. “I’m happy to be able to go home, but it’s been just over a month and now I can go? It’s a huge amount of emotions. Anger, happiness, frustration – I’m happy for everyone else and myself, I suppose, that we can go home.” Bridging visa holders were the last temporary visa category subject to a closed border, forcing them to apply for travel exemptions. Freedom of informationdata showed about 70% of bridging visa holders’ exemption applications were being rejected. Latest: Australia 🇦🇺🦘will reopen its borders to fully vaccinated tourists from February 21, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announces — ending some of the world's strictest and longest pandemic travel bans. Get vaccinated. Get your booster. You not only won't die but you can visit Australia. In one case reported by Guardian Australia, the federal government rejected six compassionate exemption applications made by Sydney woman Ash Fadian, a bridging visa holder wanting to travel to her brother-in-law’s funeral in the UK. “I’m beyond devastated. I’m just gutted to be treated like this,” she said late last month. Exemptions from aged care workers on bridging visas trapped overseas were also rejected, denying the industry staff at a time of acute shortages. The decision to open the border has also been welcomed by Australian residents who have been unable to reunite with immediate family. The government had pledged to allow immediate family to reunite prior to Christmas, but the changes introduced last year did not define adult sons and daughters of Australian residents as “immediate family”. That meant people like Stewart Hayter, an Adelaide-based grandfather, was unable to see his daughter and two grandchildren, who both live with autism. Hayter’s frustration was compounded by Morrison’s public plea for working backpackers and students to “come on down” last month. He described those comments as a “slap in the face” to those struggling to deal with prolonged separation from their families. Hayter welcomed Morrison’s announcement on Monday as “great news”, which will enable him to be reunited with his family after more than two years. In making the announcement, which had been expected, Morrison emphasised the need for travellers to be fully vaccinated and referenced the Novak Djokovic scandal, saying “events earlier in the year should have sent a very clear message to everyone around the world” that Australia requires visitors to be fully vaccinated.

There’s work to be done. It’s not as simple as just turning on the tap,” she said. The Business Council of Australia said the reopening put Australia in a position to “supercharge our economic recovery”. “This move brings to an end fortress Australia,” said chief executive, Jennifer Westacott. “This is the light at the end of the tunnel that small business, tourism operators and the events industry was desperate to see.”",News/Australia news,Australia to reopen international border on 21 February,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/07/australia-to-reopen-international-border-on-21-february
