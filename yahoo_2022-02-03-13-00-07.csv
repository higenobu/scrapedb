2/3/2022,"SYDNEY (AP) — Australian maritime experts said Thursday they believed they've found the wreck of one of the most important ships in the history of the South Pacific after it was scuttled in the U.S. more than 200 years ago. But archaeologists in the U.S. quickly countered by saying the findings were premature and a breach of contract in their joint research. For 22 years, maritime archaeologists have been investigating several ancient shipwrecks in a 2-square-mile area of Newport Harbor, Rhode Island. That's where James Cook's HMS Endeavour was believed to have been deliberately sunk by the British during the American Revolution. Cook had earlier sailed the ship around the South Pacific in a pioneering voyage before landing on the east coast of Australia in 1770. On Thursday morning, Kevin Sumption, the chief executive of the Australian National Maritime Museum, held a news conference in Sydney after alerting media that he'd be making “a major historic maritime announcement.” Sumption said archaeologists were convinced they had found the wreck of the Endeavour after matching structural details and the shape of the remains to those on original plans. “I am satisfied that this is the final resting place of one of the most important and contentious vessels in Australia’s maritime history,” Sumption said. But in a statement issued soon afterward, D.K. Abbass, the executive director of the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project, said her group was the lead organization in the study at Newport Harbor. “What we see on the shipwreck site under study is consistent with what might be expected of the Endeavour, but there has been no indisputable data found to prove the site is that iconic vessel, and there are many unanswered questions that could overturn such an identification,” Abbass wrote. “When the study is done, RIMAP will post the legitimate report.” In a subsequent interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Sumption said he thought his group's contract with RIMAP had ended in November but he couldn't comment for certain. He gave further details that he said had convinced them it was the Endeavour, including the size of the timbers, that it was European-built, and the scuttling holes in the keel. “So it tick all those boxes,” Sumption told the ABC. “So, we are very open to conversations with Dr. Abbass if she disagrees with our findings, their findings.” Sumption had earlier said that the ship’s significant role in exploration, astronomy and science made it important not only to Australia, but also to New Zealand, Britain and the U.S. “The last pieces of the puzzle had to be confirmed before I felt able to make this call,"" Sumption said at the news conference. “Based on archival and archaeological evidence, I’m convinced it’s the Endeavour."" Only about 15% of the vessel remains and researchers are now focused on what can be done to protect and preserve it, Sumption said at the news conference. He said that the museum was working closely with maritime experts in Rhode Island as well as with state and federal officials in the U.S. and Australia to secure the site. But Abbass said that while her organization recognized the connection between Australian citizens of British descent and the Endeavour, its conclusions would be driven “by proper scientific process and not Australian emotions or politics.” The ship was launched in 1764 as the Earl of Pembroke. Four years later, it was renamed Endeavour by Britain’s navy and was readied for a major scientific voyage to the Pacific. From 1768 to 1771, the Endeavour sailed the South Pacific, ostensibly to record the transit of Venus in Tahiti in 1769. Cook then continued sailing the region searching for the ""Great Southern Land."" He charted the coastline of New Zealand. His first significant encounter with the Indigenous Maori people ended badly, with his crew killing several Maori. In 2019, the British government expressed regret over the killings but stopped short of a full apology. He also charted Australia’s eastern coastline, before claiming the land for Great Britain in 1770. The Endeavour was later sold to private owners and renamed Lord Sandwich. It was deliberately sunk in 1778 by British forces during the American Revolution. A year later, Cook was killed in Hawaii during another Pacific voyage. In 1788, the so-called First Fleet of 11 ships, with hundreds of convicts aboard, arrived in Australia to establish a British colony.",World/Associated Press,"Aussies say James Cook's ship was found, US says not so fast",https://news.yahoo.com/wreck-ship-sailed-james-cook-023516811.html
2/3/2022,"When 27-year-old Eliah woke up on the sidewalk Wednesday morning, everything from her fingers to her elbows was frozen. She had slept on the ground near Virginia Avenue and 7th Street with only a blanket as temperatures dropped to 15 degrees and up to 4 inches of snow began to fall on Kansas City. Buried under the cloud of white, her body fused with the concrete that she had clung to for warmth. As Doug Langner, executive director of Hope Faith, approached the day shelter at 6 a.m., he thought she might be dead. “There was no movement and she literally was on the sidewalk with a blanket over her,” he said. But when he pulled back her blanket, revealing nothing but the pavement below her, he realized she was alive and had been there all night. About a dozen other people were lined up outside waiting for the homeless shelter Hope Faith operates, the only one of its kind in Kansas City, to open its doors. “There were about 12 people in a row that we were triaging and I had to literally pick her up because she was getting that cold,” he said. He helped her off the ground and brought her indoors. As Kansas City grapples with another winter storm, hundreds have been left searching for a place to keep warm while organizations struggle to keep up with the demand. This isn’t something that can be changed overnight, Langner said. But until the issue of affordable housing is addressed, it’s going to take will and partnership on the local level to make a difference. Eliah moved from Los Angeles to Kansas City at a young age and by age 19, had been diagnosed with schizophrenia. Though the disorder is genetic, she does not know anyone in her family who is schizophrenic. A Kansas City hospital gave her treatment to quiet the voices in 2017, she said, but it altered her mood and made her feel strange. She has not received care for her condition since. Over the past decade, she has been living on and off the streets of Kansas City. Eliah could not remember when she started sleeping on the street, but said over the past few summers she would find herself wandering Kansas City without a place to go. “I wouldn’t know why I was outside and I had no shelter,” she said. As recently as Tuesday, she had been living with her sister. But the two got into a fight and Eliah left. She said dealing with the voices in her head is a constant battle. They make her feel annoyed and afraid, leading her to say hurtful things. “I’m not in control sometimes of what comes out of my mouth ... But all I know is what I can hear,” she said. Eliah did not know there would be a winter storm Tuesday night. An overflow shelter for the Kansas City Women’s Center on East Fifth Street and Troost Avenue was at capacity, so she walked to Hope Faith, which was closed. She slept outside overnight, clinging to a blanket for warmth as snow covered the streets. “It’s mind blowing,” she said. “The wind was blowing so hard it just knocked your head off your shoulders.” “I hadn’t slept the whole night and then as soon as the morning came I became drowsy and I couldn’t get up. I couldn’t move ... And that’s when I was like ‘I got to get up.’” Eliah said they gave her breakfast and a cup of coffee at Hope Faith. She showered and received warm blankets that she could take with her. Despite wanting to stay at Hope Faith, Eliah will have to find another shelter to rest in Wednesday night as temperatures likely dip into the single digits. Langner said he planned to connect her with a case manager that would help find a place for her to stay. She said wants to see more shelters in Kansas City, but until then she does not know what to do. “I don’t have anywhere to go ... It’s like I don’t even exist and no one cares for me. And that’s a scary feeling ... So I guess I’m just going to be walking.” The number of people seeking help from Hope Faith has nearly doubled from January 2021. Many walk into the shelter multiple times a day, which led to about 2,600 visits from people without a warm place to go at the beginning of last year. As of January 2022, the number of visits rose to 4,459. The relaxing of COVID-19 protocols has contributed to the rise in visits, but in large part, there’s just more people in need, Langner said. “We have received some funding, but I would not say that it has been enough to keep up with the increase in those seeking assistance,” said Cristi Smith, director of operations at Hope Faith. Grants have helped fund food, coats and gloves. But none have helped pay for the employees keeping the shelter running. “Everybody wants to pay for the food, but nobody wants to pay for the chef or the cooks,” Langner said. Nearly 10,000 meals were served by Hope Faith last month. Langner met with city manager Brian Platt Monday afternoon about receiving short-term funding from the city to prevent layoffs and to keep the shelter open. “What I’m telling staff and the city and anyone who will listen: We have a responsibility ... If people can make it through the night, they can come during the day to get services,” Langner said. Platt’s office did not respond immediately for a comment Wednesday. This winter, the city launched a new extreme weather plan to help people experiencing homelessness. When there is a daytime high of 32 degrees and overnight temperatures dip below 20 degrees, the city will open overflow centers for those without a place to go. The centers hold about 100 people and they need a referral from a shelter. Kansas City Parks and Recreation has four community centers serving as warming shelters during the day and into Wednesday night as a part of the city’s plan. People can also access warming buses at a number of locations when the temperature falls below 10 degrees on Thursday and Friday. Those in need of clothes, blankets and other supplies can pick up items at 1700 East 8th Street, where donations are also accepted. The city also has a dashboard that tracks available beds at shelters. As of Wednesday evening, there were no available beds for single women.",U.S./Kansas City Star,A woman slept in the snow as storm hit KC.

2/3/2022,"Far-right columnist and white nationalist ally Michelle Malkin has been booted from Airbnb after using the vacation rental platform to book accommodations to attend the white nationalist organization American Renaissance's gathering in Nashville last November. “Consistent with our policies, if we become aware of users who are members of or are actively affiliated with hate groups, we remove them from Airbnb,” company spokesperson Ben Breit told The Daily Beast on Wednesday. The site also banned Malkin’s husband, she wrote, since her trips were often booked from his account. “The new twist in my case is Airbnb going after my HUSBAND for simply being married to me. Are my kids next? How about other #AmericaFirst families?” Malkin, a close ally of white nationalist Nicholas Fuentes' extremist “America First” movement, fumed Wednesday afternoon on Twitter. Conservative Group Fires Michelle Malkin Over Support for Holocaust Denier “Of course, this latest & ongoing escalation of the deplatforming wars is not just about Airbnb or me,” continued Malkin, who did not return a request for comment from The Daily Beast. “It’s about curtailing underlying power of SPLC & ADL to oppress their most effective political opponents & sabotage every aspect of our professional & personal lives.” The SPLC has deemed American Renaissance a hate group, while the Anti-Defamation League has called it a “white supremacist journal.” Airbnb requires users to adhere to their “Airbnb Community Commitment” and “treat everyone in the Airbnb community—regardless of their race, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, or age—with respect, and without judgment or bias.” The platform says that it has booted more than 1 million users for violating that commitment, most notably the white nationalists they removed in 2017 for attending the infamous Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville.
